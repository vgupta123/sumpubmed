BACKGROUND
the world health organisation  estimates that if the current tools for the treatment and prevention of tb are not improved, nearly  <dig> billion additional people will become infected by m. tuberculosis between the  <dig> and  <dig>  among these,  <dig> million will develop the active disease and  <dig> million will die from tb. by the end of  <dig>   <dig>  of  <dig> countries notified  <dig>  million new and relapsed cases, of which  <dig>  million  were new sputum smear-positive. among these notifications,  <dig>  million were from dots  areas. the region of the americas notified  <dig>  cases in  <dig>  <cit> . venezuela covers an area of  <dig>  km <dig> and has a population of around  <dig> million inhabitants, and has shown a marked decrease in the incidence of tb during the last years. the tb prevalence rate in  <dig> was  <dig>  per  <dig>  inhabitants for mortality and  <dig> per  <dig>  inhabitants for morbidity  <cit> . since then, the incidence has decreased dramatically to reach  <dig> cases , with most being confined within the  <dig> to  <dig> year age group. nevertheless, in indigenous populations, tb incidence has remained very high   <cit> . in  <dig>  the national tuberculosis control program of venezuela  implemented the directly observed treatment and since  <dig> has used a standardised six-month treatment for all new tb cases with or without culture confirmation  <cit> .

venezuela carried out the first survey of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance during 1998– <dig> as part of the global project of anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance, coordinated by the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease  and the who. the survey enrolled  <dig> patients with smear-positive tb, and living in  <dig> states from venezuela  <cit> 

the molecular characterisation of the isolates collected during this study was not carried out and there is no information on the major circulating clades of m. tuberculosis. the mutations involved in drug resistance and the question of whether the beijing family of the m. tuberculosis complex had spread into venezuela have not been studied until now. molecular epidemiological studies have showed the widespread of this family and its association with drug-resistance  <cit> .

in recent years, the genetic typing of m. tuberculosis complex  strains has been widely used to support conventional epidemiological investigations of tb outbreaks and as a tool for studying transmission dynamics. the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms , which is based on the variability of the chromosomal location and copy number of the insertion sequence is <dig>  is considered the gold standard for the genotyping of mtc  <cit> . however, this technique is expensive for developing countries, is cumbersome and requires a large amount of highly purified dna, and is limited for strains with fewer than six is <dig> insertions or when rapid results are needed. spoligotyping has emerged as a robust, easy, cheap and reliable supplementary tool for the molecular epidemiological study of tb. the establishment of an international database of spoligotypes provides information on the overall diversity of strain patterns. the combination of spoligotyping with bioinformatics has been proposed as a potential tool for defining major circulating clades of tuberculosis bacilli and to analyse the complexity of global tb transmission  <cit> . spoligotyping has also been used to track tb epidemics, detect new outbreaks, define high-risk populations and to help to verify suspected false-positive cultures due to laboratory contamination and to confirm nosocomial transmission. in conjunction with other genotyping assays, it has also been used to investigate the evolutionary genetics of the tubercle bacilli  <cit> .

this present investigation aims to provide an initial idea of the genetic biodiversity of m. tuberculosis in venezuela. we used spoligotyping as a first-line discriminatory test in  <dig> strains isolated from the  <dig> surveyed states during the first anti-tuberculosis drug-resistance survey. rflp analysis of is <dig> and characterisation of the katg and rpob genes were carried out on  <dig> of the  <dig> mdr strains included in this survey.

RESULTS
study of population
a total of  <dig> patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tb were included in the survey to determine the initial prevalence and acquired resistance to the principal anti-tb drugs. of these,  <dig>  had never been treated for tuberculosis and the other  <dig>  had previously received treatment . of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were sensitive to all four evaluated drugs and  <dig>  showed resistance to at least one drug. among the  <dig> cultures of the never treated patients,  <dig>  were resistant to one or more drugs whereas the remaining  <dig>  were susceptible to all four tested drugs. the rate of mdr was  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  in strains of never treated and previously treated patients respectively. total resistance to inh and rif in never treated patients was 4%  and 1% , respectively. this rate was 23%  and  <dig> %  respectively in previously treated patients . most of the patients with drug-resistant isolates  were aged between  <dig> and  <dig> years. among the  <dig> patients resistant to one or more drugs, 72% were male.

analysis of the spoligotyping patterns and comparison with an international database
of the  <dig> m. tuberculosis isolates from the national survey,  <dig>  could be typed satisfactorily by spoligotyping. there were isolates of the  <dig> states surveyed among the genotyped strains . the spoligotype  was determined by comparing our obtained patterns with those in the international spoligotype database of the institute pasteur of guadeloupe  <cit> . at the time of the study, the database contained patterns for  <dig>  clinical isolates, grouped into  <dig> sits. of the  <dig> strains analysed,  <dig>  were non-sit  according to spoligotype database and the remaining  <dig>  isolates clustered into  <dig> sits. of these,  <dig> were found in the international database. the inclusion of our data to spoldb <dig> created  <dig> new sits,  <dig> of them were specifically created with venezuelan isolates. these were identified with the sits:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 1719) . the new sit  <dig>  comprised  <dig> strains isolated of nine provinces from venezuela . whereas the remaining new endemic sits comprised between two and five isolates. eight new inter-region clusters were created  with one venezuelan and one non-venezuelan isolate from usa, france, latvia, the netherlands, brazil and australia . three isolates of indigenous patients from the warao ethnic group  created the new clusters sits  <dig>   <dig> and the inter-regional sit  <dig> 

of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig>  were grouped into  <dig> clusters . among the  <dig> clusters,  <dig> contained five or more isolates, which we defined as major spoligotypes. the total number of these isolates comprised 80%  of the clustered isolates. the major sits were:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

the sits found in our study allowed the classification of the isolates into representative patterns describing families or clades  <cit> , as 74%  belong to the latin american and mediterranean  family , 13%  belong to the ill-defined t , 3%  belong to the haarlem family , 1% grouped to the s family, and 9%  were classified undesignated  . the geographic distribution   <cit>  of the shared types was as follows:  <dig> sits were ubiquitous types  or are widespread in the world,  <dig> sits were endemic  and  <dig> sits were geographically limited  . we observed no strains belonging to the beijing family among the  <dig> clinical isolates analysed.

phylogeny reconstruction
we used biolayout software to build a genetic network of the sits detected in venezuela   <cit> . in this model, the size of the circles indicating the sit is proportional to their quantitative distribution in this study. we used maximum parsimony principles and assumed an underlying evolution model of the dr locus by deletion of single or contiguous direct variable repeats  to link most, if not all, of the spoligotypes found in this study. each arrow represents a phylogenetic link between two spoligotypes that differ by a genetic change, whether this change corresponds to single or many contiguous dvrs deletion. fig  <dig> shows the phylogenetic clades prevalents as well as that three variants of the lam family – lam <dig> , lam <dig> , and lam <dig>  – constitute the backbone of the genetic tb population-structure in venezuela. a more detailed picture will require further investigations using complementary genetic markers.

analysis by is6110-rflp typing, katg and rpob genes characterisation
we analysed  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates identified as mdr using phenotypic methods. while spoligotyping grouped  <dig> strains in  <dig> clusters  and  <dig> unique isolates were identified as sit  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , rflp analysis classified eight  isolates as unique, with the other six  isolates being grouped into three clusters of two isolates . the number of is <dig> per strain varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  of the three clusters, two contained isolates from patients from two different states and one cluster contained isolates from patients living in the same state . we investigated these isolates to identify the mutation associated with inh resistance  and rif resistance . as summarized in the fig  <dig>  we found the ser315thr mutation in the katg gene in  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates, identified as: ven  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

mutations in the rpob gene were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates: ven  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  no rpob mutations were found in  <dig>  of the  <dig> strains phenotypically identified as mdr, which corresponded to  <dig> previously treated patient and  <dig> never treated patients. two different mutations were observed, which occurred in codon  <dig> and codon  <dig> . the specific mutation tcg-ttg  of the codon  <dig> was detected in  <dig> isolates  and the mutation gac-gtc  of the codon  <dig> was found in  <dig> isolates . six  of the  <dig> isolates had mutations in both the katg and rpob genes .

finally, when the three clusters were studied by rflp analysis of is <dig>  spoligotyping, and mutations of the katg and rpob genes, we found that only two of them were identical by the four different methods, presumably revealing cases of recent transmission of mdr tuberculosis .

discussion
in  <dig>  the who and iuatld launched a global project on anti-tuberculosis drug resistance surveillance to assess the global extent of drug resistance. during 1998– <dig>  the ntp in venezuela carried out the first national drug resistance survey through out the entire country for a period of nine months. the sampling method was the proportionate cluster method and the total of  <dig> patients were tested. the venezuelan ntp has a long history of tuberculosis control and the results of the survey showed a very low prevalence  of mdr-tb in never treated patients, similar to those reported in canada, cuba, uruguay, and chile, which are countries with effective ntcps  <cit> . however, the prevalence of resistance to at least one drug among the previously treated cases was  <dig> % and mdr-tb was  <dig> %.

we used spoligotyping to molecularly characterise  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates, including isolates of the  <dig> states surveyed. it was not possible to analyse all isolates by rflp analysis is <dig>  nevertheless, as the molecular epidemiology of mdr m. tuberculosis in venezuela is not know, we investigated the most of mdr isolates detected in the survey using spoligotyping, rflp analysis of is <dig> and point mutations of the katg and rpob genes.

comparison of our spoligo-patterns with the international spoligotyping database revealed that  <dig> sits had already been identified. we describe  <dig> new sits specific to venezuela that were found in 75% of the  <dig> provinces surveyed and show that these types are extensively dispersed. the six most prevalent spoligotypes  included the half of all the isolates. among the clades of m. tuberculosis complex described as harbouring specific spoligotypes, 89% of the isolates studied belonged to three major genotypic families . the majority of them belonged primarily to the lam family, which has a high prevalence in latin-america, the caribbean and the mediterranean region. this family recently was reclassified in  <dig> sub-clades  <cit>  and in this study we identified sits corresponding to the sub-clades lam- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, the genetic network of spoligotypes showed that the lam- <dig>  lam- <dig>  and lam- <dig> do indeed constitute the backbone of the genetic tb population-structure in venezuela. a more detailed picture of this network would require further investigations using complementary genetic markers to better identity the clinical isolates within the lam superfamily of m. tuberculosis, which is highly prevalent in venezuela.

the "ill-defined" t genetic family encountered in different regions of the world  <cit>  was the second most common family. within this family we found sits that belonged to the sub-clades t- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . we also found some isolates belonging to the haarlem family, sub-clades h- <dig> and h- <dig>  this family has a european origin and has been described in the caribbean and central america, suggesting that it is remnant of the european colonisation  <cit> . the beijing/w genotype was not detected in this study.

our finding of seven new isolates belonging to sit  <dig> , which has been reported in guadeloupe, french guiana, haiti and venezuela, suggest a common origin. sit  <dig> had been reported in the international database as only being found in venezuela and the usa, and our study adds other  <dig> clinical isolates, to this sit, from patients living in seven venezuelan provinces. further studies are needed for a better understanding of the distribution of these spoligopatterns.

when the venezuelan isolate spoligopatterns were added to the international database, eight new inter-regional clusters were created by matches with identical patterns from usa, brazil, france, latvia, australia and the netherlands. curiously, one of these new inter-regional clusters , which included an australian isolate, shared a pattern with one of our venezuelan isolates belonging to an indigenous patient from the delta amacuro state.

we characterised the katg and rpob genes in 78%  of the mdr strains isolated in the survey. we observed that 64% of the isolates had a mutation in the rpob gene, whereas other studies have reported mutations in the 81-bp core region in more 90% of mdr strains  <cit> . it has been reported that a mutation outside of the 81-bp rpob region associated with rif resistance, and the heteroresistance caused by a mixture of mycobacterial subpopulations with different susceptibilities to rif may influence the sensitivity of the molecular tests for detecting resistance  <cit> . in our case, the rifampicin-resistance of these strains had been confirmed by two phenotypic methods, however the mutation in the rpob gene was no detected in five of the fourteen strains analysed. nevertheless, a new test to confirm the resistance of those strains could not be carried out because the cultures of the strain genotyped were not available. the ser531leu and asp516val mutations detected in this study are among the most common observed worldwide  <cit> .

mutations in the katg gene have been reported between  <dig> and 80% of inh resistant m. tuberculosis strains. the mutation ser-thr at codon  <dig> of katg is the most common  <cit> . in our study, 43% of the isolates showed this mutation, consistent with other studies  <cit> . other mutations in of this gene and other gene regions, such as the inha locus, the kasa, ndh, oxyr-ahpc intergenic region, have been implicated in inh resistance. however, we did not evaluate these mutations.

the characterisation of rpob could discriminate between the three clusters grouped by rflp analysis of is <dig> and by spoligotyping, as only one showed identical mutations suggesting a recent transmission of mdr tuberculosis  <cit> . this cluster contained isolates recovered from the same province. the other two clusters had different resistance-associated mutations, indicating that these isolates had acquired mutations independently, and were probably transmitted before the acquisition of drug resistance.

there is limited information regarding the distribution of m. tuberculosis complex genotypes as well as few molecular studies on mdr strains have been carried out in the most latin american countries. a recent study describing the genetic diversity of m. tuberculosis complex and the world-wide distribution of spoligopatterns  <cit>  showed only a limited number of registered strains, particularly in regions outside the immediate vicinity of venezuela. greater financial means are needed to implement an adequate infrastructure and to develop molecular typing techniques for the national reference laboratory at ntp, which will be an important tool for the control programmes in these countries.

although venezuela has had, a well functioning ntp during many years, the proportion of immigrants from neighbouring countries with a high incidence of tb and mdr strains, the reduction of tb control activities, and a similar decrease in the locating and treatment of cases among indigenous populations may worsen the current tb situation in the coming years. other national studies incorporating other molecular epidemiology methods are needed to evaluate the actual situation of mdr in venezuela.

CONCLUSIONS
as it is important to clarify the molecular epidemiological characteristics for effective tuberculosis control, we used spoligotyping as a first-line discriminatory test. this is the first genetic biodiversity study of m. tuberculosis in venezuela and our results should be considered a starting point for the creation of a national genotype database to support the national tuberculosis control program in venezuela.
