BACKGROUND
during normal nervous system development, neurons depend on growth factors secreted by their target tissues for survival  <cit> . these neurotrophic factors bind to cell surface receptors on developing neurons and activate intracellular signalling pathways that inhibit programmed cell death and promote neuronal growth. the regulation of programmed cell death by survival factors plays an integral part in ensuring that neuronal populations of the correct size are established  <cit> . in addition, increasing evidence suggests that apoptosis contributes to the neuronal loss seen after acute injuries to the nervous system, such as stroke or trauma, or in cell culture and animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson's disease and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . developing sympathetic neurons have proved to be a valuable model for studying the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and the signalling pathways that regulate neuronal death  <cit> . these cells require nerve growth factor  for survival during late embryonic and early postnatal development. when deprived of ngf, sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis and this death is inhibited by actinomycin d and cycloheximide suggesting that new gene expression is required for cell death to occur  <cit> . the key prediction of this hypothesis is that the transcription of specific genes increases after ngf withdrawal and that the proteins encoded by these induced genes trigger cell death.

to date only a limited number of induced genes that promote apoptosis have been identified, either by studying the expression of candidate genes  or in mrna differential display experiments . in the case of each of these genes the mrna and protein increases in level after ngf withdrawal and experiments with knockout mice have demonstrated that the gene is required for ngf withdrawal-induced death  <cit> . however, the intracellular signalling pathways that are altered by ngf withdrawal - the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway is activated and the pi3k-akt and raf-mek-erk pathways are inactivated - are likely to regulate the expression of a much larger number of genes. some of these genes, like bim and puma, will directly regulate the intrinsic pathway of caspase activation. however, other genes induced after ngf withdrawal may be involved in other aspects of ngf withdrawal-induced death, e.g. alterations in signalling pathways, changes in cell shape, the decrease in the rate of protein synthesis or neurite fragmentation. no previous study has comprehensively addressed these issues in sympathetic neurons. recent advances in gene microarray technology have allowed us to investigate the expression of all known genes in sympathetic neurons for the first time. the affymetrix rat exon  <dig> st microarray allows more accurate measurement of gene expression at the whole gene level because there are several oligonucleotide probes for each exon of a gene. in addition, exon arrays can be used to measure the expression of individual exons, which provides information about alternative splicing. microarray analysis represents an unbiased approach to the investigation of ngf-withdrawal induced apoptosis and will identify the majority of the genes that are up- or down-regulated after ngf withdrawal.

using developing sympathetic neurons as a model system, we have carried out a genome-wide analysis of gene expression at  <dig> hours following ngf withdrawal. furthermore we have analysed gene expression in ngf-deprived sympathetic neurons in the presence or absence of the mlk inhibitor, cep- <dig>  <cit> . by including cep- <dig> in our experimental design we were able to identify which of the genes induced after ngf withdrawal are potential targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun signalling pathway, which is activated after ngf withdrawal and required for ngf deprivation-induced death  <cit> . to provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons we also performed functional analysis that identified highly enriched genetic pathways. our data provides a comprehensive overview of how ngf withdrawal alters signalling pathways and global gene expression. this will increase our understanding of the basic mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis and may also identify new targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs.

RESULTS
temporal analysis of ngf withdrawal induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons
to comprehensively study the expression of all known genes in rat sympathetic neurons we used affymetrix exon arrays to profile gene expression at  <dig> hours after ngf withdrawal compared to +ngf as a control. we selected  <dig> hours because this was previously defined as the transcriptional commitment point  <cit>  and induced genes known to be required for ngf withdrawal-induced death, e.g. c-jun, bim, egln <dig>  are expressed at a high level at this time.

to be able to relate any changes in gene expression that we might observe to the morphological and biochemical changes that are known to occur after ngf withdrawal we carried out a temporal analysis of ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis using several well-defined markers . the morphological changes that occur in sympathetic neurons following ngf withdrawal are apparent after 8- <dig> hours of ngf deprivation . during this time, the smooth appearance of the plasma membrane is lost and the cell becomes irregular in structure. this is accompanied by beading of the neurites. at later timepoints , membrane blebbing and extensive neurite degeneration occur shortly before the neuron starts to lose its structural integrity. nuclear changes such as chromatin condensation and nuclear shrinkage were visualised by staining with hoechst dye and dna fragmentation was detected by tunel labelling. these changes occur rapidly after ngf withdrawal but become much more apparent from 12- <dig> hours . other key apoptotic events such as cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase  <dig> were also measured . cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria following ngf withdrawal and eventually decreases in level. similarly, caspase  <dig> becomes activated and is clearly detected in sympathetic neurons deprived of ngf from  <dig> hours. we also detected an increase in c-jun phosphorylation at serine  <dig> following ngf withdrawal . this site is phosphorylated by jnks, which are activated after ngf deprivation. importantly, the level of c-jun phosphorylation increases before and peaks at  <dig> hours. therefore at  <dig> hours, the timepoint chosen for our exon microarray analysis, the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway has been activated in many neurons, and some cells in the population are already undergoing apoptosis.

gene expression profiling in sympathetic neurons after ngf withdrawal
to identify new genes that may play a role in ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis, we performed a gene microarray analysis using affymetrix exon arrays and rna isolated from sympathetic neurons that had been cultured for  <dig> hours in the presence of ngf , absence of ngf  or absence of ngf but with the mlk inhibitor cep- <dig>  added to the medium . mlks are upstream activators of the jnk pathway in sympathetic neurons and cep- <dig> therefore blocks the increase in jnk activity and c-jun phosphorylation and protects against ngf withdrawal-induced death. three independent experiments were performed. quality control and data analysis revealed good normalisation and reproducibility. an fdr-corrected p-value of  <dig>  was used as an initial cut off to identify statistically significant differences in gene expression between each of the three different treatment groups . each individual comparison generated a list of differentially expressed genes which were either up- or down-regulated in sympathetic neurons. when comparing the +ngf and -ngf treatment groups this analysis revealed  <dig> genes that were up-regulated and  <dig> genes that were down-regulated . a more stringent statistical threshold with an fdr-adjusted p-value of <  <dig>  reduced this number to  <dig> and  <dig> up- and down-regulated genes respectively. further analysis revealed that of the up-regulated genes with a fdr adjusted p-value of <  <dig> ,  <dig> genes had a fold change of greater than  <dig> . similarly, the expression of  <dig> of the genes that were down-regulated changed in level by greater than 2-fold .

we also checked our microarray data for the genes previously shown to be regulated by ngf withdrawal in sympathetic neurons, such as c-jun, dp <dig>  bim, egln <dig> and cyclind <dig> and found that their expression had changed as predicted . importantly, the induction after ngf withdrawal of those genes previously defined as targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway, c-jun, bim, dp <dig>  mkp <dig>  <cit>  was reduced by cep- <dig>

the fold increase in rna level after ngf withdrawal or after ngf withdrawal in the presence of cep- <dig>  from the microarray is shown for genes that have been previously reported to be transcriptionally regulated in this system .

gene ontology analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering
gene ontology covers three domains: cellular component, molecular function and biological process. however, to obtain an overview of the functional categories and the biological relevance of the genes regulated by ngf withdrawal, we used an alternative strategy of functional analysis . functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms using david identified those annotations that were significantly overrepresented amongst the list of genes significantly de-regulated after ngf withdrawal compared to a reference gene list consisting of all of the annotated genes represented on the microarray. all genes significantly up- or down-regulated  after ngf withdrawal  were eligible for this analysis. gene lists that contained up- or down-regulated genes were analysed separately. following ngf withdrawal, major functional categories that were especially up-regulated included intracellular signalling cascade, ion transport and transcription . in contrast, the down-regulated genes appeared to be involved in cell cycle and intracellular transport as well as nucleoside and ion binding. interestingly, twice as many genes associated with the cell death process were down-regulated compared to up-regulated. functional categories such as the er unfolded protein response and negative regulation of protein kinase activity were significantly over-represented in the up-regulated genes whilst in the down-regulated genes, categories such as cholesterol biosynthetic process and the electron transport chain were significantly enriched . notably, the proportion of up-regulated genes related to amino acid transport and positive regulation of developmental process was also significantly higher than expected by chance. finally, a significant proportion of genes associated with the cellular components plasma membrane, mitochondria and the er was strikingly different between the up- and down-regulated genes .

the  <dig> most significantly up- and down-regulated genes were subjected to hierarchical clustering analysis . both samples and genes were clustered according to their expression profiles using the euclidean distance metric to calculate dendrograms. genes with similar expression profiles may be regulated by common pathways and be involved in related functions. we observed four major patterns of gene expression : 1) genes induced after ngf withdrawal that require the mlk-jnk pathway, for example dusp <dig> and hamp ; 2) genes induced after ngf withdrawal that may not depend on the mlk-jnk pathway, e.g. egln <dig> and prg1; 3) genes that are down-regulated after ngf withdrawal that are rescued by cep- <dig>  e.g. hmgcr and insig <dig>  and 4) genes that are down-regulated after ngf withdrawal whose decrease in expression is not affected by cep- <dig>  e.g. dusp <dig> and prl6a <dig>  genes belonging to some of the most common networks are listed in table  <dig>

the fold increase in rna level after ngf withdrawal or after ngf withdrawal in the presence of cep- <dig>  is shown for a selection of genes that have been grouped according to functional activity. the level of gene expression in the presence of ngf was set to  <dig>  negative fold changes refer to down-regulation. only genes with a fdr-adjusted p-value of <  <dig>  are shown.

validation of gene induction after ngf withdrawal by real time pcr
functional enrichment analysis revealed that the annotation er-unfolded protein response was the most enriched term after ngf withdrawal suggesting that an er stress response occurs in sympathetic neurons deprived of ngf. we therefore initially selected two regulated genes from this category for further validation. trib <dig>  and ddit3/chop <dig>  were the third and ninth most up-regulated genes respectively after ngf withdrawal . the trib <dig> mrna was previously shown to increase in level after ngf withdrawal in pc <dig> cells  <cit>  but nothing is known about its role in sympathetic neurons. chop <dig> has not been studied before in sympathetic neurons. the increase in the level of the trib <dig> and ddit3/chop <dig> mrnas was reduced by cep- <dig>  suggesting that these genes are potential targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway. to validate these exon array results, we cultured sympathetic neurons for  <dig> days in the presence of ngf and then for a further  <dig> hours in the presence or absence of ngf ± cep- <dig>  the levels of trib <dig> and ddit <dig> mrna were then measured by quantitative real time pcr . after ngf withdrawal, the levels of trib <dig> mrna and ddit <dig> mrna increased by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively but this was reduced to  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold in the presence of cep- <dig> when normalised to gapdh . a similar increase was seen in trib <dig> and ddit <dig> mrna levels after ngf withdrawal when normalised to hprt <dig> . we also found that the txnip gene was significantly up-regulated after ngf withdrawal. txnip binds to and inhibits thioredoxin, a major antioxidant protein in neurons. any perturbation of the redox system in neurons could lead to a cellular pro-oxidant state that is a necessary component of apoptotic death  <cit> . we found that the txnip mrna levels mirrored the patterns from microarray analysis . interestingly, txnip mrna levels increased significantly after ngf withdrawal  and this was reduced to  <dig> -fold in the presence of cep- <dig> when measured by qpcr and normalised to either gapdh or hprt <dig>  two other genes were also validated by quantitative pcr: ndrg <dig> and mxi <dig>  both of these genes are associated with the myc gene regulation network and are induced after ngf withdrawal by  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold respectively. quantitative pcr confirmed the increase in mrna levels for both of these genes .

the protein levels of selected regulated genes increase after ngf withdrawal
we examined the effect of ngf withdrawal on the levels of the proteins encoded by the  <dig> selected genes and their localisation. in immunoblotting experiments, we observed a significant increase in the levels of the trib <dig> and ddit <dig> proteins by  <dig> hours after ngf withdrawal. in contrast, when sympathetic neurons were deprived of ngf in the presence of  <dig> nm cep- <dig> for  <dig> hours, there was no significant increase in the levels of these proteins when compared to neurons cultured in the presence of ngf . levels of trib <dig> and ddit <dig> protein and their subcellular localisation were also studied by immunofluorescence . in the presence of ngf, trib <dig> levels were low and levels of ddit <dig> were almost undetectable. levels of these proteins started to increase after ~ <dig> hours peaking at 12- <dig> hours after ngf withdrawal. trib <dig> was localised in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas ddit <dig> was localised mainly in the nucleus after ngf withdrawal. however, in the presence of cep- <dig>  the levels of both proteins were decreased significantly to almost basal levels and more importantly were not detected in the nucleus. the protein levels of the other three genes: txnip, ndrg <dig> and mxi <dig> were also studied by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence . significant but modest increases in the levels of the txnip, ndrg <dig> and mxi <dig> proteins were seen after ngf withdrawal and cep- <dig> reduced this to varying degrees. the increase in txnip protein level after ngf withdrawal was smaller than that seen at the transcriptional level. the effect of cep- <dig> was also not as significant at the protein level. the increase in the level of the txnip protein and its localisation after ngf withdrawal were also studied by immunofluorescence. the txnip protein was clearly seen at  <dig> hours after ngf withdrawal in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and this was followed by a steady increase in protein levels over time. both of the myc pathway-associated proteins, ndrg <dig> and mxi <dig>  also increased in level after ngf withdrawal and cep- <dig> reduced this increase .

the txnip and trib <dig> promoters contain potential c-jun binding sites
we previously showed that three of the genes that are induced after ngf withdrawal in sympathetic neurons, c-jun, dp <dig> and mkp <dig>  are direct targets of c-jun  <cit> . the induction of these genes after ngf deprivation is strongly reduced by cep- <dig> and the c-jun, dp <dig> and mkp <dig> promoters contain functionally important atf sites  that have been shown to bind c-jun/atf <dig> heterodimers in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and emsa experiments  <cit> . some of the induced genes identified in our exon array analysis might also be direct targets of c-jun, in particular those whose mrna induction after ngf withdrawal is strongly suppressed by cep- <dig>  for example txnip and trib <dig> . we therefore searched for conserved potential c-jun binding sites in the promoter, first exon and first intron of the rat txnip and trib <dig> genes . the txnip promoter contains an atf site ,  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> in the rat gene, that is identical in sequence to the reverse complement of the jun <dig> tre site in the c-jun promoter . this site is conserved in the rat, human, and cow txnip genes and contains two base changes in the mouse gene . in the case of trib <dig>  we identified a conserved atf site   <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> in the rat gene . this site is identical to the reverse complement of the atf site in the dp <dig> promoter  and is conserved in the rat, mouse and cow genes and only one nucleotide differs in the human trib <dig> gene . the presence of these potential c-jun/atf <dig> binding sites in the promoters of the rat txnip and trib <dig> genes suggests that these genes might be direct targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway.

discussion
in  <dig>  it was first proposed by martin et al.  <cit>  that new rna and protein synthesis is required for ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons. however, since then only a small number of genes have been shown to be regulated in this system and these were identified either by candidate gene approaches or the differential display technique. this is partly because it is difficult to obtain large numbers of sympathetic neurons for in vitro studies. however, advances in technology have now allowed us to identify the majority of the genes regulated by ngf withdrawal in sympathetic neurons. using affymetrix exon arrays and rna isolated from rat sympathetic neurons, we investigated the global pattern of gene expression at  <dig> hours after ngf withdrawal. this time-point represents the transcriptional commitment point for sympathetic neurons undergoing ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis and induced genes known to be required for ngf withdrawal-induced death, e.g. c-jun, bim, and egln <dig>  are expressed at a high level at this time. we were able to detect almost all of the genes known to be regulated after ngf withdrawal  indicating the reliability of the microarray data. however, one exception was the previously described up-regulated gene puma  <cit>  which is required for ngf withdrawal-induced death  <cit> . on further investigation, we found that no probe sets matching the puma gene were represented on the rat affymetrix exon  <dig> st microarray. nevertheless, microarray technology remains a reliable tool and represents the best method for obtaining a complete overview of patterns of gene expression in this system. in addition, microarray studies can identify candidate genes for functional studies. for example, in the microarray experiments described in this paper we identified mkp <dig> as a gene induced after ngf withdrawal that could be a target of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway. we subsequently showed that mkp <dig> is a direct transcriptional target of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway in sympathetic neurons and an important regulator of jnk activity and the rate of ngf withdrawal-induced death  <cit> . microarrays have previously been used to study gene expression in potassium-deprived cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . the most highly up-regulated gene in this study, trim <dig>  was subsequently shown to encode a novel e3-ubiquitin ligase that can initiate neuronal apoptosis in several in vitro models of transcription-dependent apoptosis, including cerebellar granule neurons and ngf-deprived sympathetic neurons  <cit> .

approximately 95% of the genes identified in our microarray study have never been shown before to be transcriptionally regulated during ngf withdrawal-induced apoptosis. we have been able to identify potential targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway by including cep- <dig> in our experimental design. we selected  <dig> hours as the optimal time-point for our microarray study and therefore identifying those genes and pathways that define the dying neurons at this time point could add to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuronal death programme.

in our data set, we identified  <dig> genes that were significantly up-regulated  after ngf withdrawal and the expression of  <dig> of these genes increased by more than 2-fold. conversely,  <dig> genes were down-regulated when the significance threshold was set at p =  <dig>  and the expression of  <dig> of these genes decreased by 2-fold or more. we performed gene ontology  analysis and functional enrichment analysis to identify specific annotations that were enriched following ngf withdrawal. whilst this type of analysis depends upon a controlled vocabulary and therefore has its limitations, it also represents a powerful method for extracting potentially useful biological information from our gene expression data.

in an analysis of transcription-dependent neuronal apoptosis proceeding via the mitochondrial pathway, functional categories such as intracellular signaling cascades, transcription and mitochondrial changes might be expected to be enriched. whilst these categories are indeed enriched after ngf withdrawal, other categories that contain genes which could suggest additional hypotheses about the mechanisms of neuronal death were also highlighted. the significance of the induction of er stress-associated genes, for example, may offer new insights into the cell death process, especially since a similar response was observed in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis  <cit>  and experiments in other systems suggest a role for interactions between the mitochondria and the er. on the other hand, the down-regulation of genes associated with cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis may be associated with an inhibition of cell growth since cholesterol and fatty acids are required for the synthesis of membranes.

cluster analysis allowed us to group the genes according to their pattern of expression, especially in the presence of the mlk inhibitor, cep- <dig>  the expression of many of the genes induced after ngf withdrawal is reduced by cep- <dig>  suggesting that they may be targets of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway. this group includes c-jun, dp <dig> and mkp <dig> whose promoters contain atf sites that bind c-jun and which are important for their induction after ngf withdrawal   <cit> . the induction of a few genes, such as egln <dig>  is not affected by cep- <dig>  suggesting that the transcription of these genes may be regulated by other transcription factors that are activated after ngf withdrawal, but not regulated by the jnk pathway, for example, foxo3a or myb. interestingly, cep- <dig> reverses the decrease in the level of expression of some of the genes that are down-regulated after ngf withdrawal. many of these genes encode proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and cholesterol metabolism, e.g. insig <dig>  sqle, hmgcr, and hmgcs <dig>  and their transcription is activated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins . in sympathetic neurons, the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway may negatively regulate the activity of a key transcription factor or signaling protein that is important for the transcription of this set of genes.

the expression of only a small number of cell death genes changes after ngf withdrawal. bim, dp <dig>  and puma mrna levels have been previously shown to increase after ngf deprivation and in this study we have confirmed this for bim and dp <dig>  we also found that the bmf, caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig>  and caspase- <dig> mrnas increase in level whereas the expression of cytochrome c and prothymosin alpha  decreases after ngf withdrawal . thus in sympathetic neurons, as previously described for cerebellar granule neurons  <cit> , the expression of the components of the intrinsic pathway , which are all essential for cell death, is not greatly altered by ngf withdrawal. however, what does change significantly is the level of expression of four genes that encode bh3-only proteins that activate the intrinsic pathway: dp <dig>  bim, bmf  and puma  <cit> .

ngf-deprived sympathetic neurons undergo several biochemical and morphological changes before committing to the neuronal death programme and some of these are likely to play an important role in triggering apoptosis. interestingly, levels of mitochondrial-produced reactive oxygen species  are known to increase early after ngf withdrawal  <cit>  and this causes a cellular pro-oxidant state which appears to be required for the release of cytochrome c  <cit> . the regulation of cellular redox balance is critically determined by the activity of several antioxidant systems  <cit>  one of which is the thioredoxin system  <cit> . thioredoxin itself is regulated by an endogenous inhibitor, txnip  <cit>  and a reduction in thioredoxin activity due to an increase in txnip levels might lead to increased oxidation of thiol groups in cellular proteins and ultimately an increase in apoptosis. we found a 9-fold increase in the level of the txnip mrna after ngf withdrawal and this was reduced to  <dig> -fold in the presence of cep- <dig>  which was confirmed in ngf-dependent differentiated pc6- <dig> cells . importantly, the level of txnip protein also increased significantly after ngf withdrawal and this increase was prevented by cep- <dig> . these data suggest that txnip is a potential target of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway and may play an important role in triggering the apoptotic programme after ngf withdrawal.

the endoplasmic reticulum  plays a significant role in how cellular proteins are processed, folded, modified and transported. in neurodegenerative diseases, these cellular processes may go wrong leading to various levels of er stress that may contribute to neuronal death  <cit> . when sympathetic neurons are treated with the er-stressor, tunicamycin, c-jun becomes phosphorylated but this can be prevented using cep- <dig>  <cit> . bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl have been found to associate with both the mitochondrial outer membrane and the er membrane and it has been reported that crosstalk can occur between the er and the mitochondria in cells undergoing apoptosis  <cit> . we found that two of the most up-regulated genes after ngf withdrawal, trib <dig> and ddit <dig>  are associated with the er-unfolded protein response and cep- <dig> prevented their increase in expression suggesting that they are potential mlk-jnk-c-jun targets . furthermore, functional analysis revealed that the er unfolded protein response annotation was the most overrepresented gene category after ngf withdrawal suggesting that an er stress response occurs in sympathetic neurons under these conditions. the exact role of these genes in er stress-induced apoptosis remains unclear, however, it has been shown that chop <dig>  a known ap- <dig> target gene, is induced by both er stress and oxidative stress  <cit> . a propapoptotic role for chop <dig> has been reported since its overexpression can lead to apoptosis  <cit> , whilst mefs derived from chop10-/- mice are resistant to er stress-induced cell death  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which chop induces apoptosis still remains unclear. it has been shown that chop-induced cell death is associated with the translocation of bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria and that chop-induced cell death can be prevented by the overexpression of bcl- <dig> or the knockdown of bax  <cit> . the link between chop and bax translocation could involve a novel er-stress inducible gene, trib <dig>  it has been shown that trib <dig> is induced via the atf4-chop pathway through the identification of a chop-binding site in the proximal portion of the promoter  <cit> . also, er stress can activate bim through chop-c/ebpα dependent transcriptional activation  <cit>  and in other studies chop has been found to bind to the promoter of the proapoptotic bcl- <dig> family member puma  <cit> . the relationship between er stress, chop, trib <dig> and bh3-only proteins may suggest an important role in the apoptotic pathway after ngf withdrawal. furthermore, we also identified a conserved atf site   <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> in the rat trib <dig> gene  which is identical to the reverse complement of the atf site in the dp <dig> promoter. this potential c-jun/atf <dig> binding site in the promoter of the rat trib <dig> gene suggests that this gene might also be a direct target of the mlk-jnk-c-jun pathway. we also found evidence of an increase in trib <dig> and ddit3/chop <dig> protein levels after ngf withdrawal and this increase was prevented by cep- <dig> .

ngf withdrawal leads to a decrease in pi3k and akt activity resulting in foxo activation. foxo3a translocates into the nucleus  <cit>  and has been shown to trigger apoptosis by activating the transcription of genes necessary for cell death, such as bim. the mxi <dig> gene is also a target of foxo3a, which binds to sites in the first intron downstream of the mxi1-srα promoter  <cit> . mxi <dig> dimerises with max and binds to e-boxes and represses c-myc and mycn target genes by recruiting co-repressors to their promoters  <cit> . interestingly, the mxi <dig> mrna increases in level after ngf withdrawal  whereas c-myc and mycn mrna levels decrease . overexpression of mycn in sympathetic neurons has been shown to partially protect against ngf withdrawal-induced death  <cit> , so by antagonising mycn, mxi <dig> might have a proapoptotic role in this system. furthermore, the expression of genes that are activated by c-myc and mycn decreases after ngf deprivation, for example id <dig> and ptma . ptma can act as a repressor of the apoptosome  <cit>  so it will be interesting to determine whether ptma protein levels also decrease after ngf withdrawal. conversely, the expression of genes repressed by c-myc and mycn increases after ngf deprivation, for example, ndrg <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
the sympathetic neuron model is one of the best studied models of neuronal apoptosis. for the first time, we now have a global overview of the changes occurring at the transcriptional level in ngf-deprived sympathetic neurons. in the future, it will be interesting to determine how the regulated genes identified in this study contribute to the ngf withdrawal-induced death pathway. this may lead to the identification of new targets for the development of neuroprotective drugs that inhibit neuronal death following acute injuries to the nervous system or in neurodegenerative diseases.
