BACKGROUND
hepatitis c virus  is one of the main pathogens associated with hepatocellular carcinoma . it is estimated that approximately  <dig> million people worldwide have been infected with hcv, and more than  <dig> million people die annually from hcv-related liver diseases, the main diseases being cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying hcv-induced hcc have not been fully elucidated.

the hcv core protein comprises  <dig> amino acids, has rna-binding activity, and forms the viral nucleocapsid. hcv core protein is necessary for the assembly and production of infectious virions, and is also involved in cell signaling, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and cell transformation  <cit> . furthermore, the core protein induce hcc in transgenic mice  <cit> . hcv nonstructural protein 4b  is an integral membrane protein that comprises  <dig> amino acids. electron microscopy, and biochemical, structural, and genetic studies have shown that ns4b is the key organizer in the formation of hcv replication complexes  <cit> . ns4b induces the formation of a membranous web , which is believed to provide support for hcv rna replication  <cit> . moreover, ns4b has ntpase activity  <cit>  and can bind to viral rna  <cit> . however, the role of hcv ns4b in the occurrence of liver cancer remains unclear. wang et al.  <cit>  reported that transgenic mice with intrahepatic expression of ns4b do not develop tumors, but einav et al.  <cit>  found that the hcv ns4b gene mediates cell transformation and tumor formation.

the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been associated with tumor cell growth, metastasis, and recurrence, and its excessive activation is closely associated with the occurrence of hcc  <cit> . therefore, an investigation is warranted to determine whether hcv core protein and ns4b activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby inducing hcv-related hcc. fukutomi et al.  <cit>  reported that the hcv core protein upregulates wnt <dig> and wisp <dig> in huh <dig> cells, thereby promoting cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. liu et al.  <cit>  reported that in huh <dig> cells, hcv core protein enhances wnt3a-induced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity via inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β  activity, thereby promoting the proliferation of huh <dig> cells. however, these hcv studies were most often carried out in liver cancer cell lines  <cit> , and only rarely in normal human liver cell lines. research on the impact of ns4b on the wnt/β-catenin pathway is also scarce. in our previous studies, we used reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction  to amplify the hcv core protein and ns4b genes from the sera of patients with chronic hepatitis c genotype 1b  <cit> , and then fused them with the mkate <dig> gene, which expresses red fluorescent protein. later, these genes were inserted into the lentiviral expression vector plenti <dig> /v <dig>  this was followed by viral packaging and concentration, and inoculation into huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells. therefore, we successfully constructed human hcc huh <dig> and normal human liver cell line lo <dig> models that stably expressed hcv core protein and ns4b. based on this development, in the present study we explored the effects of hcv type 1b core protein and ns4b on the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells, and examined the roles of those two proteins in the formation of hcv-related hcc. the results of this study will contribute to the formulation of new strategies to prevent and treat hcv-related hcc.

methods
cell culture
the human normal liver cell lines lo <dig>  were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum -containing roswell park memorial institute   <dig> medium  at 37 °c, 5% co <dig>  and saturated humidity. the human hcc lines huh <dig>  were cultured in 10% fbs-containing dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium   at 37 °c, 5% co <dig>  and saturated humidity. the 293ft cell lines  were cultured in 10% fbs-containing dmem supplemented with  <dig>  mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 2 mm l-glutamine  at 37 °c, 5% co <dig>  and saturated humidity.

construction of lentiviral vectors expressing hcv core, ns4b and mkate2
to improve the expressions of hcv core and ns4b genes in huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells, we used a lentiviral expression system . in brief, hcv core and ns4b genes were amplified from plasmids of pdsred-monomer-core and pdsred-monomer-ns4b , and then fused them with mkate <dig> gene, which was amplified from pmkate2-n plasmid  by polymerase chain reaction  using primers listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  subsequently, these genes were cloned into the plenti <dig> /v <dig> expression vector  by bamhi and asci digestion and t <dig> dna ligase ligation, generating the three plenti <dig> -based vectors expressing hcv core, ns4b and mkate2: plenti <dig> -core, plenti <dig> -ns4b and plenti <dig> -mkate <dig>  the inserted dna fragments were verified by sequencing.

establishment of stable cell lines expressing hcv core protein, ns4b and mkate <dig> protein
each lentiviral construct and the three packaging plasmids   were co-transfected into the 293ft cells by lipofectamine  <dig>  to produce the three kinds of lentivirus: lenti <dig> -core, lenti <dig> -ns4b and lenti <dig> -mkate <dig>  the titer of the lentivirus was determined by serial dilution and counting the number of mkate2-positive cells in each dilution. the huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells were infected by the lentivirus obtained at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  respectively, and the infection efficiency was assessed under fluorescent microscope. the huh <dig> stable cell lines expressing hcv core protein, ns4b and mkate2: huh7-core, huh7-ns4b and huh7-mkate <dig> were selected using 3 μg/ml blasticidin; the lo <dig> stable cell lines expressing hcv core protein, ns4b and mkate2: lo2-core, lo2-ns4b and lo2-mkate <dig> were screened using 2 μg/ml blasticidin. the expressions of hcv core and ns4b mrnas and proteins in these lentiviral-stable cell lines were detected by real-time qpcr and western blotting.

dual-luciferase reporter assay
to detect β-catenin/tcf transcriptional activity, we utilized the luciferase reporter plasmids ptopflash with wild-type tcf binding sites  and pfopflash with mutant tcf binding sites , each used for the non-specific activation of the reporter. the prl-tk-containing renilla luciferase vector  was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. the lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well, with each cell type inoculated into three wells. when the cells had adhered to the wells, the lo <dig> cells were treated with complete medium with or without wnt3a  at concentrations of  <dig> and 200 ng/ml for 24 h, then co-transfected with  <dig>  μg of ptopflash or pfopflash and  <dig>  μg of prl-tk using lipofectamine  <dig> . the huh7-core, huh7-ns4b, and huh7-mkate <dig> were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/well, grown to 80–90% confluence, then co-transfected with  <dig>  μg of ptopflash or pfopflash and  <dig>  μg of prl-tk. forty-eight hours after transfection, these cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was detected using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system . the experiment was repeated three times. β-catenin/tcf transcriptional activity was expressed as the relative luciferase activity of ptop/pfop normalized to renilla luciferase activity.

indirect immunofluorescence
huh7-core, huh7-ns4b, huh7-mkate <dig>  lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> were seeded into 35-mm confocal culture dishes at a density of  <dig> cells per well, with each lo <dig> cell type inoculated into three dishes. when the lo <dig> cells had adhered to the wells, 100 ng/ml wnt3a, 200 ng/ml wnt3a, and fresh complete medium were added to each of the lo <dig> plates, which were incubated for 24 h; when the huh <dig> cells reached 70–80% confluence, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline , followed by 15 min of fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde , a rinse, 10 min of incubation with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  at room temperature, a rinse, 60 min of blocking in 2% bovine serum albumin  at room temperature, and overnight incubation in diluted β-catenin antibody  at 4 °c. the rinsed cells were then incubated with diluted cf 488a–labeled secondary antibody  at 37 °c in darkness for 1 h, followed by 5 min of incubation in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  . a fluorescence microscope  was then used to examine the cells and obtain images. imagej software  was used to quantify the fluorescence. a region of interest  was randomly selected in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the images were transformed to 8-bit color. the ratio of the density of staining in the nucleus versus the cytoplasm was determined by measuring the integrated density of the rois in the nucleus and cytoplasm. cells were determined to be positive for nuclear β-catenin based on the density ratio: a value equal to or less than  <dig> was considered negative, whereas a value more by greater was considered positive. at least  <dig> cells were counted in three different microscopic fields for each cell type.

real-time quantitative pcr 
trizol reagent  was used to extract total rna from the above cells. a superscript iii first-strand synthesis system  was then used to reverse transcribe 2 μg of the total rna into complementary dna . the synthesized cdna was used as a template for detection of core, ns4b, wnt <dig>  β-catenin, cyclin d <dig>  and c-myc mrna expression. the primer sequences  used were as follows. core: 5′-cacaaatcctaaaccccaaaga-3′  and 5′-tagttcacgccgtcctcca-3′ ; ns4b: 5′-tggcattcacagcctctatcac-3′  and 5′-gcagggagtagattgagcaggt-3′ ; wnt1: 5′-gatggtggggtattgtgaacg-3′  and 5′-ggaggtgatagcgaagataaacg-3′ ; β-catenin: 5′-acaggaagggatggaaggtctc-3′  and 5′-ctcacgcaaaggtgcatgattt-3′ ; cyclin d1: 5′-ggccacttgcatgttcgtg-3′  and 5′-tgcggatgatctgtttgttctc-3′ ; c-myc: 5′-gagtttcatctgcgacccg-3′  and 5′-ccaggagcctgcctctttt-3′ ; and gapdh: 5′-gaaggtcggagtcaacggatt-3′  and 5′-cgctcctggaagatggtgat-3′ . the pcr mixture, 20 μl in total, comprised 2 μl of 10× pcr buffer, 1 μl of mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl of dntps ,  <dig>  μl each of forward and reverse primer ,  <dig>  μl of sybr green ,  <dig>  μl of taq dna polymerase , 1 μl of cdna, and 14 μl of nuclease-free water. the pcr conditions were: 40 cycles of 95 °c for 2 min; and 95 °c for 10 s, 60 °c for 30 s, and 70 °c for 45 s. all qpcrs were performed in triplicate on a  <dig> fast real-time pcr system . the relative expression level of each gene was calculated using the 2−ΔΔct method, with ΔΔct = △ct of the test sample − △ct of the control sample and Δct = mean ct of the test gene − mean ct of gapdh.

western blotting
the above cells were lysed using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer  to obtain total cellular proteins after centrifugation. the extraction of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was performed using ne-per nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents  according to the manufacturer’s protocol. a bradford protein assay kit  was then used to detect protein concentrations. sixty micrograms of protein sample was then loaded onto a gel for 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  to separate the proteins. the proteins were then transferred onto semi-dry polyvinylidene difluoride  membranes  that had been blocked for 2 h using 5% skim milk  in tris-buffered saline with  <dig> % tween- <dig> . the proteins were then cultured overnight in the following antibodies at 4 °c: mouse anti-hcv core 1b antibody , mouse anti-hcv ns4b antibody , rabbit anti-beta catenin antibody , goat anti-wnt <dig> antibody , β-actin antibody , gapdh antibody , rabbit anti-c-myc antibody , rabbit anti-cyclin d <dig> antibody , rabbit anti-beta tubulin antibody , and rabbit anti-nucleophosmin antibody  . after washing, the membrane was incubated with the following secondary antibodies: horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin g  , hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg , and hrp-conjugated donkey anti-goat igg  at room temperature for 2 h. a beyoecl plus enhanced chemiluminescent kit  was then used to test the proteins, and alpha imager  software  was used to semi-quantitatively analyze the band densities. b <dig>  β-tubulin, and β-actin  were used as loading controls for the nuclear proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and total cellular proteins, respectively. the relative protein expression level was a density ratio of each protein band relative to its loading control band.

3-- <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay
the cells described above were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of  <dig> cells per well, and continuously paved the plates for five days. mtt assays were then performed at five time-points . mtt  was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. formazan lysate  was then added to each well followed by incubation for another 4 h at 37 °c. the absorbance values were then measured at 570 nm.

plate clone assay 
the cells described above were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per well. when the cells had adhered to the wells, the lo <dig> cells were divided into two groups: an inducer-free group and a 200 ng/ml wnt3a group, and the cells in each group were cultured for 24 h; when the huh <dig> cells reached 80% confluence,  <dig> % trypsin  was used to digest and collect the cells, which were then added to 10% fbs-containing rpmi  <dig> or dmem to produce a cell suspension with a final concentration of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml. one hundred and fifty microliters of the above cell suspension was then inoculated into new 6-well plates,  <dig>  ml of 10% fbs-containing rpmi  <dig> or dmem was added, and the cells were cultured for 2 weeks at 37 °c and 5% co <dig>  after fixation with 500 μl of methanol  for 15 min, 800 μl of giemsa staining liquid  was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were cultured for 30 min. the number of cell clones was determined, and the cloning efficiency was calculated using the following equation:  = number of clones/inoculated cells × 100%. the experiment was repeated three times.

cell cycle analysis
huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells in the logarithmic phase were cultivated for 24 h in dmem or rpmi  <dig> nutrient solution without serum. the cells were then collected by  <dig> % trypsinization and centrifugation at 1000 rpm. the collected cells were suspended in nutrient solution with 10% fetal calf serum, and inoculated into 6-well plates at a concentration of 5 ×  <dig> cells. when the cells had adhered to the wells, the lo <dig> cells was divided into two groups: an inducer-free group and a 200 ng/ml wnt3a group, and the cells in each group were cultured for 24 h; when the huh <dig> cells had reached 80–90% confluence, the cells in each group were digested with  <dig> % trypsin , collected, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, rinsed in pbs, and fixed overnight in pre-cooled 70% ethanol  at 4 °c. the cells were then collected, and 5 μl of rnase a  and 10 μl of propidium iodide   were added and mixed. this was followed by incubation in darkness for 30 min. subsequently, pi signal was detected at 617 nm wavelength using bd facscalibur system  within an hour, and the cell cycle phase deduced from the fluorescence intensity using cellquest software .

statistical analysis
spss  <dig>  software  was used for the statistical analysis. all data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation . one-way analysis of variance was used for comparisons of multiple groups, and student–newman–keuls and least significant difference tests were used for pairwise comparisons of multiple groups, with p <  <dig>  considered a statistically significant difference.

the plenti <dig> -core, plenti <dig> -ns4b and plenti <dig> -mkate <dig> expressing hcv core, ns4b and mkate <dig> were successfully constructed . real-time qpcr was used to investigate the expression of hcv core and ns4b mrnas, and western blotting was used to investigate the expression of hcv core and ns4b proteins in the stable cell lines. the mrna expression levels in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  greater than in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells, respectively. the hcv core and ns4b mrna expression levels in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 105 ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> greater than in the lo2-mkate <dig> cells, respectively. western blotting revealed the presence of the core protein  in the huh7-core cells and ns4b  in the huh7-ns4b cells, whereas those proteins were not detected in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . similar results were obtained for the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells . the huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells were visualized with visible light and fluorescence images .fig.  <dig> expression of hcv core protein and ns4b in huh <dig> and lo <dig> cells. a over-expression of hcv core protein in huh7-core cells; b over-expression of hcvns4b in huh7-ns4b cells; c over-expression of hcv core protein in lo2-core cells; d over-expression of hcvns4b in lo2-ns4b cells; e visible light and fluorescent light in huh <dig> cells ; f visible light and fluorescent light in lo <dig> cells 




hcv core protein and ns4b enhance β-catenin/tcf transcriptional activities in huh <dig> cells or lo <dig> cells following wnt3a induction
to investigate the effects of hcv core protein and ns4b on β-catenin/tcf transcriptional activity, we performed dual reporter assays using the ptopflash or pfopflash firefly luciferase reporter and the prl-tk renilla luciferase vector. the statistical analysis showed that the relative luciferase activity of ptop/pfop in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells was higher than in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . when no wnt3a was used to stimulate the cells, there was no statistically significant difference in the ptop/pfop relative luciferase activity between the lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> cells . after 100 ng/ml wnt3a and 200 ng/ml wnt3a were used to stimulate the lo <dig> cells, the ptop/pfop relative luciferase activity in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells was significantly higher than in the lo2-mkate <dig> cells . activity was higher in the lo2-core cells than in the lo2-ns4b cells , and activity in the lo2-ns4b cells was higher than in the lo2-mkate <dig> cells .fig.  <dig> hcv core protein and ns4b enhance the β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity in huh <dig> cells or lo <dig> cells under wnt3a induction. a relative luciferase activity of ptop/pfop in huh <dig> cells. hcv core protein and ns4b enhance the β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity in huh <dig> stable cell line. compared with huh7-mkate <dig>  **

indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect the nuclear translocation of β-catenin protein, and the results showed that the percentage of cells positive for the nuclear localization of β-catenin protein in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells was significantly higher than in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells  . when wnt3a was not used to stimulate the lo <dig> cells, there was no significant difference between the percentage of cells positive for β-catenin nuclear localization in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells and the lo2-mkate <dig> cells  . when stimulated with two different concentrations of wnt3a  for 24 h, there was a higher percentage of cells positive for the nuclear localization of β-catenin protein in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b stable cell lines compared with the lo2-mkate <dig> cells  .fig.  <dig> hcv core protein and ns4b promote, directly or under wnt3a induction, the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in huh <dig> cells and lo <dig> cells. a subcellular localization of β-catenin in huh <dig> cells . β-catenin protein was detected by using an anti-β-catenin antibody which was visualized by an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with cf 488a dye . nuclei were counterstained with dapi . b the histogram indicating the percentage of positive cells for β-catenin nuclear localization in huh <dig> cells. hcv core protein and ns4b promote the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in huh <dig> cells. compared with huh7-mkate <dig>  **p <  <dig> . the percentage of positive cells for β-catenin nuclear staining was the ratio of the nuclear β-catenin positive cells to total number of cells. at least  <dig> cells were counted from three different microscopic fields for each cell strain. c subcellular localization of β-catenin in lo <dig> cells . d the histogram indicating the percentage of positive cells for β-catenin nuclear localization in lo <dig> cells with non-wnt3a stimulation. hcv core protein and ns4b do not increase the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in lo <dig> cells. compared with lo2-mkate <dig>  p >  <dig> . e subcellular localization of β-catenin in lo <dig> cells under 24 h 200 ng/ml wnt3a stimulation . f the histogram indicating the percentage of positive cells for β-catenin nuclear localization in lo <dig> cells under 200 ng/ml wnt3a stimulation. hcv core protein and ns4b increase the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in lo <dig> cells under wnt3a stimulation. compared with lo2-mkate <dig>  **p <  <dig> 




hcv core protein and ns4b upregulate the expression of β-catenin and its target genes in huh <dig> cells but not in lo <dig> cells
the relative mrna and protein expression levels of β-catenin, wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> in each huh <dig> cell line were determined by real-time qpcr and western blotting. the results showed that the relative mrna expression levels of wnt <dig> and cyclin d <dig> in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells were slightly higher than those in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . the relative mrna expression levels of β-catenin and c-myc in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells were not significantly different from those in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . the relative protein expression level was a density ratio of each protein band relative to its loading control band. the relative protein expression levels of β-catenin in the nucleus and cytoplasm and wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells were significantly higher than those in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells  . these results suggest that hcv core protein and ns4b promote the expression of β-catenin, wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> proteins in huh <dig> cells.fig.  <dig> hcv core protein and ns4b up-regulate protein expressions of β-catenin and its target genes in huh <dig> cells but not in lo <dig> cells. a western blotting analysis of nuclear β-catenin and cytoplasmic β-catenin protein expressions in huh <dig> cells. b <dig> and β-tubulin were used as loading controls for the nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein. b the relative protein expression level was a density ratio of each protein band relative to its loading control band. the density ratios of nuclear β-catenin band to b <dig> band and cytoplasmic β-catenin band to β-tubulin band in huh <dig> cells. compared with huh7-mkate <dig>  **p <  <dig> . c western blotting analysis of protein expressions of wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclind <dig> in huh <dig> cells. β-actin was used as a loading control for the total cellular protein. d the density ratios of wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclind <dig> protein bands to β-actin in huh <dig> cells. compared with huh7-mkate <dig> **p <  <dig> . e western blotting analysis of protein expressions of nuclear β-catenin and cytoplasmic β-catenin in lo <dig> cells. b <dig> and β-tubulin were used as loading controls for the nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein. analysis of the density ratios of nuclear β-catenin band to b <dig> and cytoplasmic β-catenin band to β-tubulin in lo <dig> cells show that there was no significant difference in the relative protein expression levels of nuclear β-catenin and cytoplasmic β-catenin among lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> . f western blotting analysis of protein expressions of wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclind <dig> in lo <dig> cells. β-actin was used as a loading control for the total cellular protein. analysis of the density ratios of wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclind <dig> protein bands to β-actin in lo <dig> cells show that there was no significant difference in the relative protein expression levels of wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclind <dig> among lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> 




however, there was no significant difference in the relative mrna and protein expression levels of β-catenin, wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> between the lo2-core, lo2-ns4b, and lo2-mkate <dig> cells  . these results suggest that hcv core protein and ns4b do not directly upregulate the mrna and protein expression levels of β-catenin, wnt <dig>  c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> in lo <dig> cells.

hcv core protein and ns4b promote the proliferation of huh <dig> cells or lo <dig> cells following wnt3a induction
the mtt assay results showed that the huh7-core cells proliferated faster than the huh7-ns4b cells , and that the proliferation of the huh7-ns4b cells was faster than that of the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . we found similar results for the lo <dig> cells .fig.  <dig> hcv core protein and ns4b promote the proliferation of huh <dig> cells or the proliferation of lo <dig> cells under wnt3a induction. a cell growth curves of huh <dig> strains. compared with huh7-mkate <dig> or huh7-ns4b, **

flow cytometry was performed to determine the cell cycle status of the huh7-core, huh7-ns4b, and huh7-mkate <dig> cells, and the results  showed that the ratio of cells in the g0/g <dig> phase in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells was reduced relative to that in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells , but the proportion of cells in the s phase in the huh7-core and huh7-ns4b cells increased relative to that in the huh7-mkate <dig> cells . the proportion of cells in the s phase in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells was not significantly different from that in the lo2-mkate <dig> cells  .

the results of 24-h stimulation with 200 ng/ml wnt3a in the lo <dig> cell lines showed that the proportion of cells in the g0/g <dig> phase in the lo2-core and lo2-ns4b cells was reduced relative to that in the lo2-mkate <dig> cells , but the proportion of cells in the s and g2/m phases increased significantly . the proportion of cells in the s phase was higher in the lo2-core cells than in the lo2-ns4b cells  .

discussion
the excessive activation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is associated with the occurrence of hcc. in hcc tissues, various molecules in the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, such as the scaffold protein axin, β-catenin protein, and secreted frizzled-related protein  <dig> , have shown abnormal expression  <cit> . studies have shown that the hcv core protein and ns4b have the potential to transform cells  <cit> , but whether these two proteins affect the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and induce hcc remains unclear.

analysis of the different gene expression profiles between lo2-core and lo2-mkate <dig>  as well as lo2-ns4b and lo2-mkate <dig>  were conducted with cdna microarrays; and the significant pathways of the differential genes involved were selected by the fisher’s exact test and χ <dig> test according to kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database. the results showed that hcv core protein and ns4b did not increase the activity of wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in lo <dig> cells, which was inconsistent with previous investigations  <cit> . then we conducted wnt3a induced lo <dig> cells group and non-induced lo <dig> cells group. since liu et al.  <cit>  reported that in huh <dig> cells, hcv core protein enhanced wnt3a-induced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner, but core alone exhibited limited activation of the ptopflash luciferase reporter in huh <dig> cells, so the stimulation of hcv core and ns4b in huh <dig> by wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway still needs further study to confirm.

in the current study, we found that hcv core protein and ns4b in huh <dig> cells enhance the transcriptional activity of β-catenin/tcf, promote the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, upregulate wnt <dig>  β-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin d <dig> protein levels, and promote the proliferation of huh <dig> cells, which showed that hcv core protein and ns4b would activate wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in huh <dig> cells. furthermore, the results of this study showed that hcv core protein and ns4b did not significantly increase the mrna levels of β-catenin and c-myc in the huh <dig> cells. this suggests that the upregulation of β-catenin and c-myc expression in huh <dig> cells by these two proteins occurs at the post-transcriptional level. this corroborates the results of a study on the activation of the β-catenin signaling cascade by hcvns5a protein  <cit> . activation of the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by ns4b has seldom been reported. moreover, comparative studies on the impact of hcv core protein and ns4b on the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway are rare. in another study on the hcv-activated wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, quan et al.  <cit>  reported that hcv core protein can induce hypermethylation of the wnt antagonist sfrp <dig> promoter, thereby downregulating sfrp <dig> in huh <dig> and hepg <dig> cells, and activating the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. huang et al.  <cit>  also reported that hcv core protein can downregulate the expression of microrna- <dig>  thereby upregulating wnt <dig> and promoting the proliferation of hepg <dig> cells. zhang et al.  <cit>  reported that hcv can upregulate microrna- <dig> to activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and promote liver cell proliferation and tumor formation, with adenomatous polyposis coli  as the direct functional target of microrna- <dig> 

however, the current study showed that hcv core protein and ns4b did not activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in lo <dig> cells, and did not upregulate β-catenin protein levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm of lo <dig> cells, or the protein levels of upstream and downstream genes , indicating that these two proteins in lo <dig> cells alone cannot activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. after stimulation with wnt3a, the three lo <dig> cell types showed increased transcriptional activity of β-catenin/tcf, but hcv core protein and ns4b enhanced wnt3a-induced β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity. the results of an indirect immunofluorescence assay also revealed that hcv core protein and ns4b expression corresponds to a higher percentage of cells that are positive for the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. the role of hcv core protein was more obvious in these cells, with hcv core protein and ns4b in lo <dig> cells potentiating wnt/β-catenin signaling activity following wnt3a induction, and possibly playing a partial role in the pathogenesis of hcv-related hcc. these results also prompted us to speculate that, in addition to viral factors, the occurrence of hcv-related hcc may be precipitated by host genetics and environmental factors .

in the current study, compared with ns4b, hcv core protein exhibited a stronger ability to enhance β-catenin/tcf-dependent transcriptional activity, induce the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, and promote cell proliferation, both in huh <dig> cells and in wnt3a-induced lo <dig> cells. this indicates that the impact of hcv core protein on the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is stronger than that of ns4b.

the huh <dig> cells used in this study constitute a hepatoma cell line that can support the replication of hcv  <cit> ; therefore, they have been widely used as an infected cell culture model for liver-related diseases. one study showed that huh <dig> cells express a mutant p <dig> gene that is transcriptionally inactive; thus, they are not suitable for many studies related to hcv-associated carcinogenesis  <cit> . because hcc cell lines are characterized by abnormal proliferation and gene expression compared with normal human liver cells, a normal human liver lo <dig> cell model was established that could stably express hcv core protein and ns4b. the model better reflects the interactions between hcv proteins and host cells, and facilitates an examination of the effects of hcv proteins on cell signaling, liver cell proliferation, and carcinogenesis. however, the lo <dig> cells used in this study were transformed normal human liver cells, and hcv core protein and ns4b were both overexpressed in the lo <dig> cells; therefore, this lo <dig> cell model cannot fully replicate the molecular mechanisms and interactions between viral proteins and host cells in vivo. elucidation of the roles of hcv core protein and ns4b in wnt/β-catenin-induced hcc will require further in vivo experiments. models of natural hcv infection in vivo and in vitro have many advantages, but also present many challenges. a previously established in vitro model does not completely replicate events in hcv infection in vivo, for example. adult primary liver cells infected with hcv are used as a model in an environment that is similar to the physiological environment of the liver, but these cells are difficult to handle, replication is low, and the cells do not support long-term hcv replication. therefore, the applicability of the model is limited. the effects of hcv infection on wnt pathway signaling in vivo and in vitro require further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results suggest that hcv core protein and ns4b can trigger wnt/β-catenin signaling in huh <dig> cells, thereby promoting their proliferation. in lo <dig> cells, these two proteins do not activate the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway alone. however, they enhance wnt3a-induced wnt/β-catenin signaling, and play a partial roles in the pathogenesis of hcv-related hcc.
