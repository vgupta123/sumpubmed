BACKGROUND
feed efficiency is an important trait that should be improved to increase the sustainability and profitability of livestock production. on the one hand, there is a growing demand for food derived from dairy cattle; on the other hand, this production is associated with a high carbon footprint  <cit> , affecting the sustainability of dairy farming. thus, there is a call for more long-term sustainable interventions. animal genomics, particularly research regarding the potential genes that are differentially expressed in relation to an increased or a decreased efficiency of feed utilization in dairy cattle, could contribute towards achieving these goals  <cit> . the definition of feed efficiency in dairy animals is more complicated than that in growing animals because the catabolism of body reserves, followed by the anabolism of body reserves until the next calving period, must be considered in dairy animals  <cit> . the main purpose of dairy cattle is the production of milk, and it is important to select cattle that have a high efficiency in converting feed into milk. this high efficiency will lead to lower feed costs and increased profits for milk producers  <cit> . high feed intake and feed efficiency reflect the high production of milk   <cit> . therefore, measuring the feed efficiency is important to improve the environment and profits of milk producers.

feed efficiency is conventionally evaluated using a conversion ratio of the feed intake to the output of the cows. feed conversion efficiency is an expensive trait to assess and, thus, lends itself to genomic selection. moreover, it is not sufficient to measure how much nutrients the animal uses to convert into energy to support growth, lactation and body maintenance. in the last 10 years, transcriptomics in dairy cattle has used gene expression microarrays to identify candidate genes for milk yield, protein yield, fertility and metabolic diseases, such as ketosis and milk fever . however, only a few studies have focused on liver transcriptomic data of feed efficiency in dairy cattle, and none have focused on nordic dairy cattle .

residual feed intake  has been used to describe feed efficiency in animals, including beef and dairy cattle . residual feed intake has been defined as the difference between the actual and predicted feed intake  <cit> . in other words, animals with low rfi are more feed efficient compare to high rfi animals. the heritability of the rfi trait  is quite reliable as a genetic selection trait . hence, the rfi may be a relevant trait to consider in selecting genetically superior animals for breeding studies. genome-wide association studies  characterizing the gene expression and gene regulatory mechanisms related to feed efficiency are quite established in pigs   <cit> ; however, such studies in dairy cattle are fairly recent  <cit> . in this study, we used an rfi adjusted for stage of lactation, management group, breed and parity. given the major role of the liver in regulating nutrient homeostasis  <cit> , it is important to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this process. thus, genome-wide gene expression studies of the liver can provide biological insights into feed processing efficiency and help to determine the mechanism of feed efficiency.

transcriptomic analyses are useful for studying animal production and health  <cit>  and have become important components of systems genomic or systems biology methods  <cit> . transcriptomic analyses provide a snapshot of all the gene expression profiles in a given tissue and insight into the gene functions pertaining to a particular trait  <cit> . microarray technologies have been the main platform for animal science research in recent years; however, this trend has been increasingly replaced by rna-seq technologies .

the primary objective of the present study was to identify potential regulatory genes and molecular pathways involved in rfi in dairy cattle by characterizing the liver transcriptome based on rna-seq technologies  <cit> . another objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different diets interacting with high- and low-rfi cattle and the resulting impact on the gene expression profiles and associated pathways. this study reports important findings regarding potential regulatory genes and the pathways underlying feed efficiency in dairy cattle using next-generation sequencing or rna-seq technology and, most importantly, the nutrigenomics aspects of rfi x diet interactions.

overrepresented pathways and gene networks
the goseq analysis did not identify any significantly enriched go  terms or kegg  pathways.

the output of the gsea  is presented in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which show the most significantly enriched pathways with fdr  q-values less than  <dig> . we identified seven overrepresented pathways for the downregulated set of genes, and none were identified for the upregulated genes in the holsteins. in the jerseys, two pathways were overrepresented for genes with negative-fold changes, and three pathways were overrepresented for genes with positive-fold changes. the top kegg pathways for the genes that were downregulated in the high-rfi group in the holsteins and the jerseys is the primary immunodeficiency pathway, while the significant pathways identified for the genes that were upregulated in the high-rfi group were only detected in the jerseys. we also identified that most of the pathways within the strong indication thresholds  were related to the metabolism of retinols, starch, sucrose, ether lipids and drugs.table  <dig> kegg pathways identified for the downregulated genes in the high-rfi group with an fdr q-value <  <dig>  from the output of the gsea in the holsteins

the networks identified from the degs by ipa®  are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  seven and six networks were identified for the holsteins and jerseys, respectively. the top networks  in the holsteins involved  <dig> genes that are implicated in metabolic diseases, endocrine system disorders and gastrointestinal diseases. the genes that were upregulated in the high-rfi group in the top network of the holsteins were acaca, cyp2c <dig>  cyp7a <dig>  elovl <dig>  fosl <dig>  hcls <dig>  ifi <dig>  nr1h <dig>  ryr <dig>  socs <dig> and tbc1d8; while the downregulated genes were cr <dig>  cth, dgat <dig>  fgfr <dig>  slc20a <dig> and taf <dig> table  <dig> gene networks from the  <dig> differentially expressed genes for the holstein group converted to human orthologous genes

the top networks in the jerseys  involve nine genes that are implicated in cellular compromise, neurological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities. the network includes the genes cyp3a <dig>  extl <dig> and tmem <dig>  which were upregulated in the high-rfi group, and the genes fdxr, gimap <dig>  gimap <dig>  gng <dig>  hla-b and znf <dig>  which were downregulated in the high-rfi group.fig.  <dig> the relationship between the nine degs in network  <dig> in the jerseys. the genes highlighted in red were upregulated, while those highlighted in green were downregulated in the high-rfi group




to investigate the degs interacting with each other, we analysed the candidate degs using the string  <dig> database. several interacting genes were identified in the holsteins. in particular, acaca interacts with bdh <dig>  dgat <dig>  cyp11a <dig>  hsd17b <dig>  aldh18a <dig>  hacl <dig> and elovl <dig>  in the jerseys, only gimap <dig> and gimap <dig> interact with each other. the top degs present in the ipa network are discussed.

discussion
differentially expressed genes
the liver plays an important role in regulating the nutrient supply  <cit> . hence, the liver transcriptome may lead to the identification of genes that are important for regulating feed efficiency  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms of action and biological functions of the highly significant degs in high- versus low-rfi animals experimentally tested under controlled versus high concentrate diets improves our understanding of the biology of feed efficiency in dairy cattle.

the results of this study show a robust relationship and interaction between certain genes involved in feed utilization, partitioning of energy and metabolism. the potential regulatory genes that show a positive effect on rfi were reported in this study.

almost all the degs in the interaction analysis were also present in the analysis without the interaction term. this result may be due to the treatment diet , which might not have a significant impact or be reflected in the differences in the gene expression in the holsteins. a similar effect was observed in the jerseys. however, we obtained a smaller number of degs compared to those in the holsteins, which could be due to the small variation among the individuals in the jersey high and low rfi groups. however, it should be noted that the number of animals from each breed is rather small and could have biased the results.

significantly enriched go terms and pathways were not identified by goseq; therefore, we focused on a number of genes that appeared several times in significant networks in the ipa, gsea and string  <dig>  hence, acaca , cyp11a <dig> , cyp2c <dig>  bdh <dig> , dgat <dig> , and fbp <dig>  in the holsteins and cyp3a <dig>  and fdxr  in the jerseys were chosen to gain a better understanding of the role of the top genes and networks that were involved. some of the degs reported in previous reports  <cit>  were found to be involved in similar processes related to feed utilization in humans, ruminants and other mammals.

recently, an investigation of two divergent rfi groups in beef cattle using rna-sequencing  <cit>  revealed eight and seven significantly degs, respectively. however, similar degs were not identified in the present study on dairy cattle, suggesting that the discrepancy may be based on the breed. however, some of our results are consistent with a study showing a connection between immune function and most of the degs associated with low and high rfi in beef cattle  <cit> . alexandre et al.   <cit>  concluded that the degs related to feed efficiency and hepatic physiology were focused more towards the immune response, the metabolism of lipids and cholesterol and hepatic inflammation, which is also consistent with the findings of the present study.

insights from the gene set enrichment analysis 
primary immunodeficiency was the top overrepresented pathway detected by the gsea. this pathway is present and significantly enriched in both cattle breeds. it was stated in the details of the pathway that primary immunodeficiency is a heterogeneous group of disorders. the downregulation of the primary immunodeficiency pathway in the high-rfi cows in both breeds suggests that a low immunity may affect the efficiency of feed utilization. ozuna et al.   <cit>  observed that primary immunodeficiency disorder is consistently inherited by low-feed efficiency pigs. consistently, kogelman et al.   <cit>  and do et al.   <cit>  reported a correlation between genes related to immunodeficiency function disorders or immunity-related diseases and low-feed efficiency in pigs.

the results of the enrichment and pathway analysis of the degs contributes towards the understanding of the function of these genes in relation to the efficiency of feed utilization. the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway was one of the top kegg pathways identified in an analysis of negative energy balance in dairy cows  <cit> . we also discovered that this pathway was overrepresented in the set of genes that were upregulated in the high-rfi group in the jersey cows . steroid hormone biosynthesis should always occur in the adrenal glands and gonads, while the liver is the site of steroid hormone inactivation. the upregulation of this pathway indicated that steroid hormones were inactivated in the high-rfi group. therefore, we could conclude that this pathway plays an important role in fe. furthermore, both cyp11a <dig> and cyp7a <dig>  which function in cholesterol homeostasis, were identified as degs in our experiments, and they are a part of this kegg pathway.

additional interesting kegg pathways that were upregulated in the high-rfi jersey group were involved in xenobiotics metabolism, retinol metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and drug metabolism cytochrome p <dig>  most of these pathways  were related to nutrients  and metabolism. de almeida santana et al.   <cit>  reported that the retinol metabolic pathway was involved in the feed conversion ratio in beef cattle in relation to rump fat thickness. the authors also discussed that lipid and protein metabolisms were well-known important factors in feed efficiency physiology. the relationship between retinol metabolism and the feed conversion ratio phenotype in nellore beef cattle has been previously described  <cit>  and  <cit> .

the top pathway of the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig> involved the cyp genes. specifically, the cyp11a <dig> gene was upregulated in the high-rfi group compared with that in the low-rfi group. the cyp11a <dig> gene was not present in the ipa output because it has no entrez gene id when uploaded as an input. however, cyp11a <dig> was also identified as a deg in the holstein group. the cyp11a <dig> gene is also known as cytochrome p <dig>  which functions in drug metabolism and cholesterol, steroid and lipid synthesis. when the expression of this gene is high, it will also lead to the active synthesis of lipids, steroids and hormones. yi et al.   <cit>  have mentioned that the upregulation of rsad, which is a gene that has a similar function to cyp11a <dig> in the low rfi  group, may lead to a decreased feed intake, high energy utilization and few energy costs by modulating fatty acid and leptin metabolism. these results are consistent with those reported by mccabe et al.   <cit> , who discovered that cyp11a <dig> was upregulated in severe negative energy balanced cows. this result suggests that the cyp11a <dig> gene indeed played an important role in lipid synthesis and the regulation of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. together with cyp11a <dig>  the cyp7a <dig> and cyp2c <dig> genes were also differentially expressed and had the same pattern of expression in the holsteins. in another study conducted by  <cit> , the cyp genes were involved in steroidogenesis and converted cholesterol into pregnenolone and then to dehydroepiandrosterone . the cyp gene function was also discussed in feed efficiency, particularly pertaining to hepatic metabolism  <cit> .

ingenuity® pathways analysis  output and interactions between degs
the output of the ipa for the holsteins showed the top networks of the  <dig> upregulated degs, which included metabolic diseases, endocrine system disorders and gastrointestinal diseases. consistently, the network of metabolic diseases was associated with the differential gene expression in the severe negative energy balance in high-yielding cows  <cit> . the metabolic disease network may be closely related to the immune system. paradis et al.   <cit>  have stated that immunity is very important to produce animals that have less energy to fight against systemic inflammation, have better detoxification of endotoxins and use more energy for growth.

the output from the string  <dig> analysis shows that among the significantly degs, the acaca gene has interactions with cyp11a <dig>  bdh <dig>  dgat <dig>  hsd17b <dig>  fgfr <dig>  hacl <dig> and aldh18a <dig>  this interaction depicts the importance of the acaca gene in this output. the function of the acaca gene is to convert acetyl coa to fatty acids, also known as lipogenesis. the upregulation of the acaca gene in the high-rfi holstein group in this network is also interesting in relation to functions in feed utilization. a positive relationship has been reported between acaca enzyme activity and intramuscular fat levels  <cit> . in addition, the negative relationship between the acaca gene and other lipogenesis pathway genes and milk production in dairy cattle was also confirmed by sumner-thomson et al.   <cit> . hence, the increased acaca gene expression might reflect the deposition of fat in the high-rfi cows.

the output of the deg analysis revealed that bdh <dig> is another interesting gene to be considered due to its downregulation in the high-rfi cattle. these genes play an important role in metabolism and synthesis and are very well known for their role in the degradation of ketone bodies. in contrast, no change was observed in the transcript abundance of genes involved in ketone body synthesis  in cows subjected to nutrient restrictions to reduce the frequency of milking  <cit> . however, our results showed a downregulation of bdh <dig> genes in the high-rfi cattle, suggesting that this group was inefficient in degrading ketone bodies.

in the present study, an upregulation of the dgat <dig> gene was observed in the high-rfi holsteins. in humans, the dgat <dig> gene was reported to be a candidate for the dissociation between fatty liver and insulin resistance  <cit> , and this result has also been observed in mice  <cit> . the dgat gene functions in the liver by catalysing the final reaction in the synthesis of triglycerides in which diacylglycerol is covalently bound to long chain fatty acyl-coas. the dgat gene might be a candidate for treating obesity in humans because the increased expression of dgat led to obesity in mice that were resistant to diet-induced obesity  <cit> .

the ipa analysis output for the jersey breed showed the top overrepresented networks, involving nine degs that are related to cellular compromises, neurological disease, organismal injury and abnormalities. these processes appear to be closely related to the top primary immunodeficiency output from the gsea kegg pathways. the importance of this related pathway was previously explained as it pertains to holsteins. the output from string  <dig> showed only one interaction between the gimap <dig> and gimap <dig> genes among the significantly degs in the jerseys. although the jersey degs differed from those in the holsteins, some genes have similar functions, such as the cyp3a <dig> gene.

the ferredoxin reductase  gene was also a top deg in the jersey breed. the fdxr gene encodes a  <dig>  kda mitochondrial flavoprotein attached to the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. fdxr transports electrons from nadph via the soluble single electron shuttle ferredoxin to a membrane-integrated cytochrome p <dig> enzyme . the upregulation of the fdxr gene, which occurs in the low-rfi jersey group, can deplete the levels of the reduced nadph. this fdxr gene is also known to be involved in cholesterol metabolism, which is also a part of steroid metabolism.

in addition, it is interesting to note that the gimap <dig> and gimap <dig> genes, which were upregulated in the low-rfi jersey group, are also related to an immuno-associated nucleotide  subfamily of nucleotide-binding proteins. this is important for controlling the immune system and responding to infections  <cit> . these genes have never been implicated or previously described in relation to feed efficiency or utilization in any species. the expression consistency of these two genes is interesting to relate to the biological functions that are important for controlling the immune system. consistent with the gsea output results, primary immunodeficiency is the top pathway and is reflected by the differential expression of these two related genes. the gimap <dig> and gimap <dig> genes require further investigation regarding their importance in controlling the immune system.

genes in the rfi x diet interaction in the jersey cattle
the degs involved in the interaction between rfi and diet were also associated with immunodeficiency, which was a key pathway consistently identified in this study. it is interesting that the diet has an impact on genes belonging to the immunodeficiency pathway, and this result paves the way for future studies to determine how to improve diet in relation to the genetic background of the animals. two protein-coding genes, sec24d and fiz <dig>  were differentially expressed in response to the diet and were associated with pathways, including immune system and transport to the golgi and subsequent modification and were involved in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . these genes might also be factors in the primary immunodeficiency pathway that was detected as significantly overrepresented in this study. the lack of a more extensive differential gene expression response indicates that the differences in the concentrate composition of the diet tested in this analysis may not have been sufficient to influence gene expression levels.

implications for improving feed efficiency via breeding
through the integration of the information obtained from the degs, functional enrichment, pathway analysis and published data, this study provides a list of candidate genes whose functions and expression levels are strongly related to rfi. these candidate genes can be used to develop genomic biomarkers, eqtls , cnv , snps  and additional markers for possible inclusion in genomic selection methods utilizing functional information [e.g., sgblup   <cit>  and blup|ga  but in a highly controlled environment. however, it is recommended that this study should be replicated with a larger sample size for the eventual validation of our findings.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated the liver transcriptome of high- versus low-rfi animals experimentally tested with control versus high concentrate diets. the results provide an important understanding of the biology of feed efficiency in dairy cattle and a basis for elucidating the mechanisms of action and biological functions of highly differentially expressed genes. this study is novel in at least two aspects as follows: one in terms of the species/breed  and the second in terms of the rfi x diet experiments. furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first study conducted exploring residual feed intake in nordic dairy cattle using rna-seq, which is known as the most accurate technology for genome-wide gene expression studies. the results reveal differences in the biological mechanisms related to residual feed intake in the holsteins and jerseys. the study identified  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes that are involved in the regulation of feed efficiency pathways in the holstein and jersey cattle, respectively. the candidate genes identified in this study will be useful for explaining the biological effects of genomic markers in genomic selection methods utilizing functional information.
