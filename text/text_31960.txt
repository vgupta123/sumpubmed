BACKGROUND
for decades, farms have used pharmacological concentrations of zinc oxide  to combat post-weaning diarrhea  <cit> . different modes of action for the antibacterial activity of zno have been proposed, one of them being the partial dissolution of the zno particles in the enteric region and the release of zn2+  <cit> . when zno is formulated to reduce this undesirable dissociation in the stomach, less zno may be added to the diet  <cit> . this is important, since much of the zno given to the piglets is excreted with their waste, causing accumulation of this metal in the environment  <cit> . the incorporation of zno nanoparticles in polymer matrices can facilitate their gradual and sustained release  <cit> .

chitosan  and alginate  are two of the most commonly studied biopolymers, particularly for drug delivery  <cit> . ch is the partially deacetylated derivative of chitin, composed of repeating units of β--2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose and β--2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose  <cit> . sa is extracted from brown seaweeds and contains carboxylic acid groups  <cit> , presents linear chains with blocks of 1–4–linked α-l-gluronic , β-d-mannuronic acid  residues, and blocks of alternated g and m residues  <cit> .

in the present study, ch and sa, with and without the addition of sodium tripolyphosphate, were combined to encapsulate nanostructured zno particles aiming for the control of their enteric release. to protect zno from the gastric acid environment, the composite structures were designed to maintain acid-soluble chitosan in the internal phase of the complex. the physical, chemical and rheological characteristics of the resulting products were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, thermogravimetry and scanning electron microscopy. the antibacterial properties of the composites were tested against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus and the mics were calculated. the in vitro release profile of zn2+ from the composites in both gastric and enteric simulated fluids was also investigated.

reagents and solvents
the commercial zinc oxide  sample  was supplied by brasóxidos indústria química ltda. . chitosan  , sodium alginate , sodium tripolyphosphate   and zinc acetate dehydrate  were purchased from sigma-aldrich co. . acetic acid , sodium hydroxide , hydrochloric acid , hydrated potassium phosphate  and sodium chloride were purchased from vetec química ltd. .

preparation of biopolymer solutions, zinc oxide dispersion and microcapsules
the ch solution at 2%  concentration was prepared by adding 2 g ch slowly to 100 ml of acetic acid 1% , under magnetic stirring. this solution was heated for 30 min and maintained for 12 h under stirring at room temperature. the sa aqueous solution at 2%  was prepared using 2 g of sa in 100 ml water with magnetic stirring for 12 h. the tpp solution at 3%  was prepared in 100 ml ultrapure milli-q water .

a zinc acetate dihydrate  <dig>  m solution  was prepared with milli-q water under magnetic stirring and at room temperature in a two-necked 1000 ml flask adapted to a heating mantle and a reflux condenser. the reaction mixture was refluxed for 30 min. after cooling, a 5 m naoh solution was added dropwise, until achieving ph  <dig>  <cit> , after which refluxing was continued for 3 h. the reaction product was decanted and the supernatant solution discarded. after successive washings with milli-q water, the product was oven-dried at 100 °c for 24 h, characterized and used for the preparation of the microcapsules.

commercial zno  was dispersed in water  at 4 g/100 ml composition, at  <dig>  rpm with a ultra-turrax dispersing ika t <dig> equipment  for 40 min, oven-dried at 100 °c for 24 h and characterized.

zno nanoparticles were added to 20 ml of acetic acid 1% solution in a 50 ml beaker, and manually dispersed until no more granules were observed. subsequently, this dispersion was homogenized in a turrax at  <dig>  rpm for 30 min and 15 ml of the ch 2% solution was added, dropwise, with the aid of a pasteur pipette, at a turrax stirring speed of 5000 rpm. then, 30 ml of the sa 2% solution was added, dropwise, still under stirring at 5000 rpm, resulting in zno nanoparticles and both ch and sa  and zno microparticles with ch, sa and tpp , in which 15 ml of a tpp solution 3% in milli-q water were also added to the reaction mixture. the resulting mixtures were subjected to ultrasonic radiation for 15 min   and dried at 60 °c for further characterization.

physicochemical and morphological characterizations
the xrd curve for the samples was obtained on a miniflex diffractometer  operating at a cukα wavelength of  <dig>  Å. the samples were exposed to the x-ray beam with the x-ray generator running at 30 kv and 15 ma. scattered radiation was detected at ambient temperature in the angular region  of 2–80° at a rate of 3°/min and a step size of  <dig> °. the diffractogram was smoothed  and the baseline was corrected. scherrer’s equation ) was used to estimate the average size of the zno crystallites.  <dig> dxrd=kλ/βcosθ 


where d is the average crystallite diameter in Å, k =  <dig>  is the shape factor, λ =  <dig>  Å is the wavelength of the cukα radiation and θ is the angle of bragg diffraction. the β value was determined by eq. 
  <dig> β2=b2−b21/ <dig> 


where b is the full width at half maximum  of the  reflection of zno and b is the fwhm of the  reflection of the quartz standard, which was taken directly from the software provided with the equipment.

the zno, zno/cat and zno/ca samples were characterized by ftir spectroscopy on a perkin elmer spectrophotometer, frontier model  using kbr disks, with accumulation of  <dig> scans and 2 cm− <dig> resolution. the kbr used to prepare transparent disks was permanently maintained in an oven at 50 °c. samples were thoroughly dried and carefully weighed  before grinding with 100 mg of kbr.

rheological measurements were performed at 25 °c using a controlled ar <dig> stress rheometer , fitted with a cone-and-plate geometry . the strain sweep was measured first as the evolution of the complex modulus at  <dig>  rad s− <dig> for the determination of the linear viscoelastic region. subsequently, the frequency sweep  was measured from 10− <dig> to 102 rad s− <dig> , within the viscoelastic region.

thermogravimetric analysis  was performed under a controlled n <dig> atmosphere using a q <dig> thermoanalyzer equipment from ta instruments . the measurements were performed at a heating rate of 10 °c/min from room temperature to 700 °c.

zinc contents were determined according to the standard aoac method  using a varian aa <dig> atomic absorption spectrometer . each sample was heated at 550 °c and the ash boiled with 10 ml of 20% hcl in a beaker and then filtered into a 100 ml standard flask. all samples were analyzed in triplicate.

scanning electron microscopy  was used to visualize the samples with a fei quanta™  <dig>  scanning electron microscope, at the acceleration voltage of 20 kv. the samples were vacuum-coated with gold before measurements.

the particle size distribution  of the samples was determined by laser diffraction, using the masterisizer  <dig> malvern equipment . the samples were dispersed in water on a hydro 2000sm apparatus until the laser obscuration index reached 10–12%. the psd values for the samples were determined in triplicate and were expressed as equivalent volume diameters at 10% , 50%  and 90%  of the cumulative volume, as the average of the diameter values  and span. the span values indicated the particle polydispersity, and were calculated according to eq. .  <dig> span=d90%−d10%/d50% 


bioactivity of zno complexes
two solutions were prepared: simulated gastric juice solution  with 2 g of nacl in 7 ml of hcl, with ph adjusted to  <dig> , and simulated enteric juice solution  using  <dig>  g of kh2po <dig> in 250 ml distilled water, adding 77 ml of  <dig>  n naoh at ph  <dig>  and distilled water to complete the volume of 1 l for each  <cit> .

the assays were performed in triplicate, in 250 ml beaker, using 175 ml of sgs or ses with 10 mg of each composite. this was added to 25 ml of the same solution into previously hydrated dialysis membranes . the systems were kept at  <dig> °c under gently magnetic stirring and the solutions  and 15 ml aliquots were collected in different time intervals  and the solutions were replenished with the same volume. aliquots were stored and submitted to aas analysis to determine the amount of zn 2+ released each time in the simulated media.

the minimum bacteriostatic concentration  evaluation of commercial zno, zno nano, zno/cat and zno/ca samples was performed by the well diffusion method and by liquid growth-inhibition assay against escherichia coli dh5α  and staphylococcus aureus atcc  <dig> , gram negative and gram positive bacteria, respectively. the same assay was performed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of ch used in the formulation of the samples. the strains were grown in lb medium ph  <dig>   in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm, at 37 °c, for 24 h. the cellular density was adjusted in a saline solution  where the turbidity equivalent to mcfarland  <dig>  standard  was used as an inoculum in the presence of the composites at increasing concentrations, at 37 °c for 18 h at 200 rpm. subsequently, cells were serially diluted in saline solution , plated on solid lb, and incubated at 37 °c for 18 h. colony-forming units were counted. the mbc was taken as the concentration at which 100% growth inhibition was observed.

RESULTS
the crystallite size of nano and commercial zno  was calculated from scherrer’s formula applied to the most intense reflection , as observed in the diffractogram displayed in fig. 1a. it was observed that the reflections obtained for nano zno  were less crystalline with wider bases, characteristic of nanoparticles. figure 1c shows that zno nanoparticles reduced the crystallinity when comparing to chitosan  , as reflections were weaker and wide, as observed in a previous study  <cit> . three strong reflections could be noticed, displayed in fig. 1a between the angles of 2θ = 30° and 40°, corresponding to zno, but the diffraction corresponding to zno/cat and zno/ca samples were very small, revealing the intense reduction in the orientation of crystallinity . it should also be noted that the zno/cat samples encapsulated  <dig> % of zinc and had a higher crystallinity than the zno/ca samples, with  <dig> % zn.fig.  <dig> x-ray diffractogram in the 2θ region of  <dig> ° to 80° for the  i- commercial zno, ii- zno nano synthesized sample,  i- sodium alginate and ii- chitosan,  i- zno/cat and ii- zno/ca




the ftir spectrum for sa  shows intense absorption bands with maximums at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1032 cm− <dig>  these bands were attributed to stretching vibrations of o-h, c-h bonds, asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations of the carboxylate groups and, finally, to c-o-c bonds from the polysaccharide structure. for the ch samples, the broad absorption with maximum at 3401 cm− <dig> was assigned to -oh and -nh <dig> stretching vibrations . the absorptions at 1657 cm− <dig> and 1594 cm−1were attributed, respectively, to the amide i  and amide ii  from amide functional groups in the solid state. in this region , the absorption attributed to the n-h bending  vibration would be expected to appear. the strong absorption at 1094 cm− <dig> was attributed to the c-o-c bond from the polysaccharide structure.fig.  <dig> infrared spectra obtained for  sodium alginate  and chitosan ;  zno nano , commercial zno , zno/cat  and zno/ca

the presence of 78% zn2+ in the new pure synthesized zno nano and 99% in the commercial zno was observed, while the zno/cat and zno/ca composites showed  <dig>  and  <dig> %, zn2+, respectively by atomic absorption spectrophotometry . the particle size of each composite is displayed in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  in all measurements, the zno/cat samples were shown to be a smaller particle than the zno/ca samples. when the mean values were evaluated, a value of  <dig>  μm of zno/cat against  <dig>  μm zno/ca was observed. however, the poly dispersion index expressed in span value for this sample was higher , revealing a less homogeneous distribution of particles in comparison with the zno/ca, that had a smaller span value  .table  <dig> diameters of the zno/cat and zno/ca microparticles

the amount of inorganic residues  can be observed in the tga curve, that indicated mineral matter content of 40%, approximately, for zno/ca, and 55% for zno/cat . the largest residue observed in the zno/cat sample is due to phosphorus  from the tpp and zn2+ present in zno. however, the results of the aas zn2+ quantification indicated that the zno/cat samples have lower zn2+ concentration  compared to the zno/ca samples . the in vitro release assay demonstrated that the zno samples complexed with ch, sa and tpp  and no tpp  were effective in protecting zn2+ in simulated gastric medium, as displayed in fig. 7a. in sgf, at time zero, nano and commercial zno samples had the lowest release of zn2+ between the  <dig> tested samples, however, the first 15 min revealed an increase of  <dig> %, from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %, from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . the release of zno/ca and release of the zno/cat sample remained constant  during the same period. from 15 min onwards, release by the zno nano and commercial sample increased and became more intense, reaching  <dig> % and 27%, respectively, at 45 min. it was verified that despite the nano zno contain less zn2+ in its formulation  when compared to the commercial zno , it released  <dig>  times more at 45 min. this behavior was not observed in the protected samples, zno/cat and zno/ca. both samples had a low and constant release taxa as shown in fig. 7a,  <dig>   to  <dig>   times lower than that observed in the zno nano sample. figure 7b indicates that, at the beginning of the test using ses, nano zno released less zn2+  than the zno/cat  and zno/ca  samples and remained as such until the end time point  of the experiment, when a release of  <dig> % and  <dig> % was recorded, respectively. while commercial zno showed an initial release of  <dig> % zn2+ and a gradual increase of  <dig> % tea at 120 min.fig.  <dig> tga curves for zno/cat and zno/ca samples at a heating rate of 10 °c/min

the antimicrobial activity of nano and commercial zno was tested. zno/ca sample exhibited the lowest mbc for both tested bacteria  , where 1 mg/ml of zno/ca sample  provoked a total inhibition of e. coli and s. aureus growths. the zno/cat sample inhibited e. coli growth at  <dig>  mg/ml  and s. aureus at 2 mg/ml . when compared to the activities using the pure zno, e. coli growth was inhibited by 350 μg/ml  and s. aureus growth by 250 μg/ml , showing that the incorporated zn2+ concentration is lower in the chitosan and alginate composites. on the other hand, the commercial zno showed the worst antimicrobial activity compared to other compounds, with a mbc of 500 μg/ml  and 650 μg/ml . these results can be explained by the larger particle size of commercial zno , while the nano zno  presented a lower particle diameter . another study  <cit>  has also described the tpp effect, including the decrease of particle size when crosslinker concentrations were increased, which allows to enhance zno protection in the simulated gastric fluid.table  <dig> antimicrobial activity of commercial zno, zno nano, zno/cat and zno/ca against escherichia coli

discussion
the addition of tpp  to the formulation interfered in the acquired reflections, where the zno/ca samples showed higher amounts of amorphous structures, a sodium alginate  characteristic, as observed in fig. 1b, line i, corroborating data from a previous study  <cit> .

the band shift attributed to the asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group, acquired by ftir, reported the composite formation, where a linkage occurs between the sa carboxylate groups and the ch amine groups, but only a slight shift  was observed . interestingly, a much more expressive shift to lower wavenumbers  of both bands was observed in the zno/cat spectra . this clearly demonstrates the tpp contribution in increasing interactions in this composite.

moreover, the spectra obtained for these products corroborated the ftir data, reinforcing the role of tpp in increasing physical interactions between the gel components. the cat matrix forms a stronger gel than ca . on the other hand, the addition of zno  seems to disturb the gel structure. zno/cat showed g’ and g” values superior to those for zno/ca.

the zno/cat complex showed a smooth and fine surface, corroborating a previous report by  <cit> , which may be due to interfacial interactions between the ch chains and nano zno, which could possibly act as intermolecular crosslinks. therefore, zno nano can contract and restrict the mobility of ch chains, and subsequently change the expansion of the surface morphology. on the other hand, when observing fig. 4c, a rougher and crowded surface was observed, probably due to the lack of tpp. this reveals the influence of the addition of tpp on zno/cat morphology , in addition to zno linking with ch. the addition of tpp decreased the particle size, probably due to crosslinking of polymeric chains, resulting in greater particle compression.

the high performance of the zno/cat sample in sgf can be explained by the addition of tpp, the crosslinking agent, used in the preparation of ch due to its rapid gelling ability  <cit> , where tpp reduces the gel pore size and effectively traps zn2+ in the interstices of the support matrix  <cit> . in simulated enteric juice, the zno/cat and zno/ca complexes released more zn2+ than zno nano and commercial samples, as expected. the zno delivery systems developed in this study allow for high concentrations of zn2+ in the enteric environment, which are necessary to achieve the antimicrobial effect. the partial dissolution of zno particles releases zinc ions , which contributes to the antimicrobial activity of the oxide  <cit>  against the enteric microbiota of weanling pigs.

the zn2+ dissociation from the zno composites is due to the formation of strong electrostatic but reversible bonds, even without the use of any covalent crosslinking agent  <cit> . furthermore, the sa layer could have prevented the gastric degradation of ch, because the positive charges from ch reduced solubility at low ph. however, at around neutral ph, a higher amount of negative charges sequester positive ch charges, resulting in dissolution of the ch/sa complex and increase in the release of zn2+ in the middle enteric region  <cit> . zno/ca and zno/cat showed good release of zn2+ in sef, triggered by the change in the ph.

the lower concentrations of zno/ca are probably due to the absence of tpp, thus allowing closer contact between zn2+ and the target microorganisms, where zno/ca showed a complete inhibition of e. coli growth at lower concentrations than zno/cat . for s. aureus, zno/ca prevented the growth complete at a lower incorporated concentration of zn2+ , compared to the 204 μg/ml of zno/cat. the ch/sa complex network, even in the absence of tpp, showed greater efficacy when compared to pure zno nano, which is effective in inhibiting e. coli and s. aureus at concentrations of 273 μg/ml and 195 μg/ml, respectively.

a comprehensive mechanism for the antimicrobial effect of nano-zno particles is still under debate. in an aqueous environment, the zno nps aggregate to micrometer-sized particles and do not interact effectively with microorganisms. thus, the antimicrobial activity has been mainly attributable to the dissolved zinc species . the dissolution of zno nanoparticles and zn2+ release seem to be able to generate radical oxygen species , consequently, activating a cytotoxic cascade of events that include intracellular calcium flux, mitochondrial depolarization, and plasma membrane leakage .

in the conditions of the present study, s. aureus was shown to be more sensitive to both the zno nano and zno/cat samples in comparison to e. coli. the difference in antibacterial activity against both microorganisms can be related to differences in the chemical and structural composition of the cell membranes, particularly of the cell wall  <cit>  and to the preparation of the composites. s. aureus tends to develop defenses against oxidative stress by releasing products such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and thioredoxin reductase . in our study, we can suggest that the new particles of zno were able to assemble at cellular membrane and damage it, despite the greater defense of s. aureus to the toxicity of zno.

some zno particles can attach to the bacterial membrane surface, damaging it, and this mechanical damage has been postulated as a probable mechanism of antimicrobial inhibition  <cit> . according to the literature, zno nano bacteriostatic effectiveness can be ascribed to the disorganization of the membrane, increasing its permeability and resulting in the internalization of the nanoparticles. one possible explanation is that the antibacterial activity exhibited by zno composites is based on the abrasive texture of the zno surface. this abrasive texture, due to surface defects, fixes zno to the protein molecules from microorganism membranes, promotes internalization and consequent cell metabolism inhibition, killing the bacteria  <cit> .

several factors can interfere with the daily feed intake by animals, such as diet composition, the quality of raw materials and the sanitary conditions of farms  <cit> . according to the health challenge of each farm and immune conditions of piglets, different concentrations of zno in their diets can be adopted, which usually range between  <dig> and 5000 ppm . considering an average daily intake of 400 g of feed by animal, established according to their growth phase  , containing 4000 ppm  of the commercial zno, it should be expected the release of approximately  <dig>  mg of zn in the piglet gut, an amount  <dig> fold less than that, which corresponds to the mbc against e. coli, 198 mg zn/ <dig>  kg of feed, and  <dig> fold less than mbc for s. aureus −  <dig>  mg zn/ <dig>  kg of feed. released zn2+ seems to be under the effective mbc threshold, particularly because considerations about the water intake and gut secretion should be done in order to calculate zn2+ concentration in the gut.

the zno/cat composites obtained in this study, at the same concentration of zno, led to a release of  <dig>  mg of zn, a value 12-fold lower than the mbc for e. coli  and 11-fold lower than for s. aureus . however, zno/ca, released  <dig>  mg zn2+, which is  <dig> -fold lower for the mbc for both evaluated bacteria . besides, the coating of zno showed a gut empowering effect due to the reduction in the release of zn2+ in simulated porcine gastric fluid. this feature can reduce the amount of zno composites to be administered to weaned piglets.

these experiments revealed a remarkable advantage of the synthetized products compared to commercial zno, since the concentration of zn in pig intestine released from those compounds should be higher. the intake dosage of  <dig>  g of commercial zn should be enough to ensure the release of 198 mg in the middle intestine, corresponding to the mbc value for e. coli. in the same way, the intake of  <dig>  g of zn might release  <dig>  mg corresponding to zno mbc for s. aureus. these values ​​are approximately  <dig> times higher than necessary  of zno/cat to obtain a release of  <dig>  mg that are enough to inhibit e. coli and  <dig> times greater than the intake  necessary to release  <dig>  6 mg zn from zno/cat and inhibit s. aureus in the gastrointestinal environment. the same would be true for zno/ca in a more pronounced way, because in order to release  <dig>  mg of zn  it would be necessary for each piglet to ingest at least  <dig>  g of zn, value  <dig> and  <dig> times lower than that observed for commercial zno inhibit e. coli and s. aureus, respectively. although, the intake of zno composites can alter the gut microbiota composition, reducing the bacterial diversity and effecting even the probiotic bacteria, the overall supplementation effect of wearing piglets is positive since it can prevent attachment of pathogenic bacteria to the intestinal villi avoiding wearing unspecific diarrhea.

CONCLUSIONS
we have successfully synthesized new zno nanoparticles - zno/ca and zno/cat, using ch/sa and an ultrasound-assisted methodology. the novel composites showed an optimum in vitro release profile of zn2+ in simulated enteric fluids assays and expressive antimicrobial activities against e. coli and s. aureus. the physico-chemical analysis and in vitro assays indicate that zno microparticles are a promising designed product to be applied for piglet livestock. the data from this study suggest that the zno nanoparticle composites may be effective in diets fed to weanling pigs, and may have the potential to significantly reduce fecal zn excretion. experiments with weanling pigs fed diets containing zno nanoparticle composites should be conducted to address the clinical evaluation of zno composites in piglets fed in controlled conditions.
