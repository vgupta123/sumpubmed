BACKGROUND
affymetrix genechip® microarrays are the most widely used and best standardized platforms for large-scale analysis of gene expression data  <cit> . current chips are capable of measuring essentially whole genome expression values  simultaneously. the affymetrix technology uses a set of probe pairs, typically  <dig> to  <dig> in number, to represent a gene  <cit> . each probe in the probe pair is  <dig> bases in length. the perfect match  probe corresponds exactly to the transcript of interest. the corresponding mismatch  probe in the probe pair differs only in the middle  base and is intended to measure nonspecific binding  <cit> . prior to class comparisons, typically the signal intensities for the probe pairs in a probe set are condensed into an expression summary value, a measure representing the abundance of the corresponding gene transcript  <cit> . statistical tests are then applied to these probe set expression summaries to identify which genes should be declared as differentially expressed  <cit> .

such an approach reflects the two central goals of statistics, estimation and inference. although usually considered in tandem in microarray data analysis, the two steps are potentially separable  <cit> . the purpose of most microarray experiments is to draw inferences regarding changes in expression for a large number of genes, and estimating the level of gene expression per se is rarely of interest. the intermediate step of estimating expression summaries may introduce a source of variability to the analytical process, which in turn may affect error estimates used in hypothesis testing. a direct test of hypotheses using probe level data may potentially improve the accuracy of identifying differentially expressed genes. alternatively, an increase in accuracy naturally leads to tests that offer the same statistical power using smaller sample sizes. most algorithms have focused on improving expression summary methods, and emphasized the need for adequate numbers of replicates to ensure the accuracy of results  <cit> . this paper reports the results of our validation of the s-score algorithm, a method that offers unique advantages in the analysis of gene expression by using probe level data directly.

the s-score algorithm and software was originally designed in response to the limitations of mas  <dig>  comparison call algorithm  <cit> . it was specifically developed for comparing two hybridized genechips® when it is of interest to identify a list of differentially expressed genes. it was developed assuming a simple error model for the expression of probe pair signals, in which the detected signal is assumed proportional to the probe pair signal for highly expressed genes, while approaching a background noise level  for genes with low levels of expression  <cit> . a similar model, with both additive and multiplicative components, has been empirically validated for cdna microarrays  <cit> . for two genechips a and b, the error estimate for the ith probe pair is given by

where ba and bb are the background noise estimates associated with genechips a and b, respectively; lia and lib are the pmia-mmia and pmib-mmib probe pair differences for genechips a and b; and γ is a predefined value assumed to be constant for all genechips which represents the proportionality of error attributed to highly expressed genes. therefore, γ may be thought of as the additional proportion of error attributed to lia and lib, which results in a larger quantity for highly abundant genes when lia and lib are much greater than ba and bb.

the εi in equation  does not represent a rigorous statistical error estimate, but an intuitive proxy for this quantity  <cit> . the variance of lib – lia, the difference in signal intensities between genechips a and b, would be

where sdta and sdtb are the statistical  difference threshold  values of genechip a and b, respectively. rawq is an estimate of the background noise, where bg is the number of probes used in the background estimate; stdevk and pixelk are the standard deviation and number of pixels for the kth probe; and the scale factor  is used to scale each of the intensities on the chip to a specified target background value  <cit> . the values of rawq and sf are available from the affymetrix genechip operating software . the value of γ was chosen as indicated in equation  so that the scale of the s-scores does not depend on the expression levels of a gene. this is consistent with previous work showing that the additive component of the error model  varies from array to array , while the fractional multiplicative error is fairly constant  <cit> .

these probe pair level error estimates are then used in the calculation of a new measure of relative change in gene expression, called the significance score or s-score. a relative change in probe pair intensities is calculated that converts the probe pair signal differences into multiple measurements with equalized errors. these relative changes are then summed to form the s-score, which is a single measure of the significance of change for the gene in question. for probe set j, the s-score is calculated as

where lia, lib, and εi are as in equation ; nj is the number of probe pairs within the probe set; and α is a normalization factor that corrects for the effect of correlation among probe pair signals. the value of α was chosen for an individual chip so that the variance of s-score values on an array is  <dig> when outliers are excluded. under these conditions, for non-differentially expressed genes, the s-score follows a standard normal distribution  <cit> . thus, p-values are readily calculated and used to determine the significance of change in gene expression. the s-score method thereby eliminates the need for estimation of probe set expression summaries, simplifying the analytical process. s-scores, by virtue of their direct comparison of individual probe-pair data, provide comparison of the expression change between two chips. this allows at least inferential statistics on experiments with limited numbers of microarrays  <cit> .

the s-score has been used in selecting differentially expressed genes in peer-reviewed, published studies  <cit> , but has not yet achieved widespread use despite its attractive features. this may be due to concerns that the initial validation studies of the s-score algorithm utilized data sets for which the identification of genes that were differentially expressed were not known, and therefore may be considered inadequate by today's standards. therefore, we performed an additional empirical validation study of the s-score algorithm against comparisons utilizing more recently developed methods – rma, mas <dig> and dchip – using data sets in which each probe set was known to be either differentially or non-differentially expressed. such an analysis would also determine whether hypothesis testing using probe level data directly offers advantages over testing using expression summaries.

RESULTS
for the quality control measures, quantile-quantile plots for the dilution dataset showed that the assumption of a single distribution is reasonable . the latin square dataset showed problems with linearity, which was especially notable for chips  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> where the r <dig> values were less than  <dig>  . analyses were repeated after excluding these three chips . the impact of this departure on the analysis is discussed below.

dilution dataset
typical plots of s-score values against other algorithms for representative concentration levels are shown in figures 1- <dig>   the s-score values clearly separated the spike-in clones from other probe sets at concentrations of  <dig> pm and greater, with some loss of accuracy at lower concentrations. rma expression summary values also separated the spike-in clones from the remaining probe sets, although this did not occur completely until concentrations of  <dig>  pm and greater. the mbei values produced by dchip did not provide total separation at any concentration, although definite improvement was noted with concentrations of  <dig> pm and greater. similarly, mas <dig> p-values did not provide total separation at any concentration.

latin square dataset
for each genechip analyzed from the latin square dataset, observed ranks of the spike-in clone probe sets for each algorithm were examined in comparison to their true underlying rank using chip  <dig> as the reference . similar results were obtained when other chips were used as the reference . ideally, the observed rank should equal the true underlying rank. therefore, the proportion of spike-in clones with ranks less than or equal to  <dig> should be  <dig> . further, it should be noted that as the observed rank for the spike-in clones falls, it becomes more likely that the associated probe set will fail to be identified as differentially expressed, and hence will be missed as an important gene  for further study . the mas <dig> algorithm had the highest proportion of clones in the top  <dig> , though it had difficulty in separating the clones from each other despite clear differences in fold-change . compared to rma and dchip, the observed ranks for the s-score are generally much closer to the true underlying ranks, and the proportion of clones in the top  <dig> is higher . these differences were statistically significant between the s-score and rma  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and between the s-score and dchip  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the differences between the s-score and mas <dig> were not statistically significant  =  <dig> , p >  <dig> ). analyses conducted using other chips as the baseline exhibited similar trends, although the results were not always statistically significant. analyses conducted after excluding arrays  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed the performance of the s-score, rma, and mas <dig> to be comparable  >  <dig>  for all comparisons of the s-score versus rma and χ <dig> >  <dig>  for all comparisons of the s-score versus mas5).

discussion
this study validates the s-score using standardized datasets that were unavailable at the time the algorithm was developed. in their original paper, zhang and colleagues provided initial validation of the s-score using three different methods  <cit> . first, the s-score values were clearly reproducible when comparing dissimilar brain regions, where many gene expression differences would be expected . this was not the case when comparing similar brain regions, where few expression differences would be expected . second, the s-score values were found to be more consistent than mas <dig> in labeling expression differences between dissimilar brain regions, without loss of sensitivity. third, clusters generated using the s-score were much tighter than those generated using the logarithm of the fold-change ratio, ln, with an average r of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. later work yielded results similar to the initial validation, finding the s-score values highly reproducible between dissimilar brain regions  but not between similar brain regions   <cit> . finally, a reanalysis of a previous study using the s-score generally confirmed the prior results, but also revealed a number of genes with significant, reproducible changes that were not identified in the original analysis  <cit> .

however, since all of these validation studies involved experimental samples, the true gene expression changes were unknown. by using datasets in which individual probes are spiked in at known concentrations, the accuracy of the algorithm can be externally validated by independent means. using two widely available spike-in datasets, the s-score compares very favorably to the more recently developed algorithms available in rma, dchip, and mas <dig> in detecting differential gene expression.

the dilution dataset assesses the sensitivity and specificity of each algorithm at various concentrations, and allows a determination of the limits of detection. the s-score exhibited an excellent combination of sensitivity and specificity in the detection of differentially expressed genes, clearly separating the spike-in clones from the other probe sets except at the lowest concentrations. the s-score and rma outperformed both dchip and mas <dig>  with the s-score capable of separating the spike-ins from other probe sets at slightly lower concentration than rma.

the latin square dataset assesses the performance of each algorithm under more realistic conditions, where expression differences vary by gene. in such situations, investigators will often be interested in those genes showing the most significant changes between experimental and control conditions. this is typically accomplished by ranking genes by increasing order of significance, and selecting the top m ranked genes for further study. thus, it is critical for an algorithm to assign observed ranks that are similar to expected ranks that would be obtained using the known fold-change in gene expression; otherwise, genes that play a critical role in the difference between the experimental and control condition might be overlooked. the arrangement of spike-in concentrations in the latin square dataset allows expected ranks to be calculated based on the true fold-change and compared to the observed ranks generated by the different algorithms. again, the s-score compared favorably to the other three algorithms. mas <dig> did perform slightly better, with a higher proportion of spike-in genes ranked in the top  <dig>  though the difference was not statistically significant. it is also concerning that the mas <dig> p-values were unable to differentiate among the spike-in genes despite clear differences in fold-change. this is particularly critical if resources permit follow-up of only a limited subset of genes; in such situations, the mas <dig> p-values would provide little help in choosing from the list of genes to explore. the s-score had significantly better performance than rma or dchip, with a greater proportion of spike-in genes ranked in the top  <dig> than the proportion obtained using either of the other two programs. after excluding three arrays of potentially poor quality, rma was able to equal the performance of the s-score on most chips and slightly outperform the s-score on a small number of chips, although the difference was not significant. mas <dig> continued to detect a larger number of spike-in probes, though again the difference was not significant.

some limitations of this investigation must be noted. the analytical methods, particularly for rma and dchip, were unusual in that replicate experiments were not used. currently, the s-score method and its software implementation allow only the comparison of two chips at a time. thus, the datasets were limited to one chip for each experiment so that the conditions would be similar for all four algorithms. clearly, replication is necessary to assess biological variation. when multiple chips per condition are available, the utility of the other algorithms – rma, dchip, and mas <dig> – in detecting differentially expressed genes has been well documented. however, this study provides evidence that additional refinement might be achieved using methods similar to the s-score, which perform tests of hypotheses based on probe level data rather than expression summaries. further work is clearly needed in extending the s-score method to allow comparison of multiple chips simultaneously, as the biological significance of the gene expression changes can only be addressed using replicate experiments  <cit> . a limitation of using the s-score for a two-chip comparison is that it is possible that a large observed s-score might be indicative of a defect in the chip  rather than a biologically significant change  <cit> . such an occurrence would not be a problem for the current study, where the biological truth is known, but would be of concern in studies involving only experimental data sets. nevertheless, the results of this study provide excellent justification for further development of the s-score method. such extensions of the s-score are currently being developed, using a mixed-effects approach to model the probe level data for multiple genechips.

another limitation of this study relates to the datasets examined. many standard quality control measures for microarray data could not be applied to these datasets. thus, while the data used in this study are generally believed to be of good quality, this is difficult to verify. this may be a particular issue for the latin square dataset, where several probes had markedly different values between expected and observed ranks. examination of genechip level plots of concentration of spike-in by expression revealed why problems in detecting differential expression among specific comparisons may be difficult. that is, for some probe sets, the absolute expression change is likely too small to be detected, even though the fold-change is great . for other probe sets, the degree of true fold-change is likely too small to be detected . however, there remain a small number of probes where the known and calculated ranks are markedly different without an obvious explanation. these problems were encountered with all four algorithms, and were most notable with chips showing a poor degree of linearity when examining concentration of spike-in and expression for the probe sets. it is unknown if these differences in the ranks might be due to poor chip quality, hybridization conditions under which these chips were run, or scanning issues.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the s-score algorithm utilizes a novel approach to detecting differential gene expression, basing tests of hypotheses on probe level data rather than expression summaries. results indicate that such a method performs very favorably compared to other currently available methods using a standardized dataset. further research is needed to confirm these results and fully explore the gains that may be achieved using probe level data directly; some of these goals may be realized by current efforts to refine the s-score method. the analysis of gene expression data is a complex and evolving field, and the s-score algorithm offers distinct advantages that make it an attractive option for analysis of oligonucleotide microarray experiments.
