BACKGROUND
leprosy and tuberculosis constitute age-old infectious diseases that have affected human beings for millennium. leprosy, caused by mycobacterium leprae, continues to be a significant public health problem in several developing countries, including brazil, and is responsible for the legacy of millions of individuals with permanent physical deformities  <cit> . on the other hand, tuberculosis, caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis has most likely killed more human beings than any other disease in history, at an average of  <dig> individuals per minute worldwide  <cit> . one major reason for the failure to eradicate these diseases may be closely related to the absence of effective vaccines since bcg, the only one available against both leprosy and tuberculosis, has displayed highly variable protection rates around the world  <cit> . mycobacteria are intracellular pathogens that preferentially infect mononuclear phagocytes although other cell types such as epithelial and endothelial cells are also colonized during disease dissemination  <cit> . m. leprae, also found inside schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, is responsible for the nerve damage observed in leprosy  <cit> . mycobacteria are gram-positive bacteria presenting a very complex and unique cell wall structure, which seems to play a major role in their pathogenesis. deciphering the mechanisms implicated in mycobacterial pathogenesis remains a major challenge for leprosy and tuberculosis research, which will hopefully lead to the development of new, more effective prophylactic and/or therapeutic strategies.

during infection, a critical early event is the adherence of the microorganism to the target tissues within the host. adhesion is accomplished by specific molecular interactions involving adhesins on the bacterial surface and receptors on the surface of the host cell. the histone-like hlp protein is a positively-charged, surface-exposed molecule recently implicated in the attachment of pathogenic mycobacteria to host cells. this protein was initially described as a laminin-binding protein  involved in m. leprae-schwann cell interaction.  <cit> . more recently hlp has been shown to also play a major role in mediating the adhesion of mycobacteria to epithelial respiratory cells by interacting with proteoglycan-containing receptors such as heparan sulfate and hyaluronic acid  <cit> .

mycobacterial hlp, roughly twice the size of other bacterial histone-like proteins, is a highly conserved protein shared by all mycobacterial species. the n-terminal half of mycobacterial hlp containing the prokaryotic dna-binding motif shares significant homology with the histone-like hu proteins found in escherichia coli and the hb proteins in bacillus subtilis, respectively. the c-terminal half of mycobacterial hlp, absent in most bacteria, has an unusual amino acid composition owing to a high alanine, lysine, and proline content resembling the c-terminal region of eukaryotic class h <dig> histones  <cit> . initial studies by aoki et al  <cit>  have mapped the heparin-binding site of hlp  in the n-terminal region between thr <dig> and phe <dig> overlapping the previously defined dna-binding region  <cit> . however, after testing the truncated recombinant hlp molecules corresponding to the n-terminal  and the c-terminal  domains of the protein, we recently found that the interaction of hlp/lbp with laminin and heparin was for the most part mediated by the c-terminal domain of the protein. moreover, the same domain was found to be involved in hlp/lbp-mediating bacterial binding to human schwann cells  <cit> . it is clear that additional studies are needed to more precisely define the interacting regions of hlp/lbp with glycosaminoglycans .

in the present report, the interaction of hlp with heparan sulfate was further investigated by using a panel of 30-mer synthetic peptides covering the full length of the protein and nuclear magnetic resonance . the resulting data indicate that hlp interacts with heparan sulfate through two distinct regions located, respectively, in the n-terminal and c-terminal domains of the protein.

RESULTS
binding of hlp synthetic peptides to heparan sulfate
in a previous study, truncated recombinant hlp molecules were tested and it was demonstrated that the highly positive c-terminal region of the protein is involved in its binding to extracellular matrix components and its capacity to act as an adhesin  <cit> . to refine and confirm these data, a panel of overlapping 30-mer synthetic peptides covering the entire sequence of hlp was immobilized in microtiter-plate wells. the peptides were, then, incubated with biotinylated heparin or heparan sulfate in phosphate buffer  <dig> mm ph  <dig>  and their binding capacity was monitored by the addition of streptavidin peroxidase. the list of hlp peptides with their corresponding amino acid sequences and pi shown in table  <dig>  as shown in figure 1a, heparan sulfate bound to peptides covering the c-terminal region of the protein. among the peptides derived from the n-terminal region, detectable binding of biotinylated heparan sulfate was only observed in wells coated with p31– <dig> and p46– <dig>  although the signal with these peptides was low, this was a consistent result observed in six independent experiments. an identical binding pattern was observed when biotinylated heparin was used instead of heparan sulfate . the binding of the peptides covering the c-terminal region is in agreement with previous results demonstrating that rhlp-c , but not rhlp-n , was able to bind heparan sulfate in a similar solid-phase assay  <cit> . moreover, the binding of p31– <dig> is in agreement with the hlp heparin-binding region between thr <dig> and phe <dig> defined by aoki et al,  <dig>  <cit> . however, the binding of p46– <dig> suggested an additional binding region.

effect of salt concentrations on the binding of hlp peptides to heparan sulfate in microplate assays
all peptides that showed heparan sulfate-binding activity are rich in basic amino acid residues. to investigate whether hlp-heparin/heparan sulfate interactions are mediated by electrostatic forces involving the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups of heparin and heparan sulfate with the positively charged residues of hlp, binding assays were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of nacl. as can be seen in figure 1b, for p31– <dig>  p46– <dig>  p136– <dig>  and p151– <dig> and the entire hlp protein, significant binding inhibition was achieved with increasing concentrations of nacl, indicating the involvement of electrostatic forces in these interactions.

binding of p31– <dig>  p136– <dig>  and p151– <dig> to heparin-sepharose
the binding capacity of p31– <dig>  p136– <dig>  and p151– <dig> was also analyzed by affinity chromatography on a column of heparin-sepharose. individual peptides were applied to a heparin-sepharose column and subsequently eluted with a 0– <dig> m nacl gradient. figure  <dig> shows the elution profile and the salt concentration necessary for elution of each peptide. peptides p31– <dig>  p36– <dig>  and p151– <dig> bound to the column and were eluted at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  m nacl, respectively, confirming their heparin-binding capacity.

analysis of the interaction of hlp peptides with heparan sulfate by std-nmr
to further elucidate the basis of hlp and glycosaminoglycan interaction, the complexes between the peptides p16– <dig>  p31– <dig>  p46– <dig>  p136– <dig>  p151– <dig>  and heparan sulfate were studied using saturation transfer difference – -nmr experiments. this technique allows for the identification of protons from a ligand molecule in contact with a macromolecule. resonances of the oligosaccharide were selectively saturated and the spectrum was subtracted from a reference spectrum from which the heparan sulfate was not saturated. lastly, the enhancements were observed in the difference  spectrum  <cit> . protons of the ligand peptide, which were in close contact with heparan sulfate, received the highest degree of saturation and were easily identified within the std spectrum.

nmr experiments confirmed the heparan-sulfate binding capacity of p31– <dig>  p46– <dig>  p136– <dig>  p51– <dig>  and the inability of p16– <dig> to do so. figure  <dig> shows the reference tocsy spectrum  of heparan sulfate  in the presence of  <dig> mm p16– <dig>  the difference in the total correlation spectroscopy – -std spectrum obtained  shows no signal, indicating that peptide p16– <dig> does not bind to heparan sulfate, thus providing a negative control with no specific interaction with the macromolecule. nevertheless, figure  <dig> shows a clear interaction between peptide p31– <dig> and heparan sulfate. figure 4a shows the cross peaks of the ligand protons involved in the formation of the complex. a close analysis of the std spectrum shows a correlation among the δh at  <dig>  ppm, βh and γh at  <dig> , and  <dig>  ppm, respectively, suggesting that at least one of the arg residues is in close contact with heparan sulfate. in addition, it is evident that the magnetization is also transferred to the γch <dig> of val. figure 4b provides evidence of the interaction of phe residues with heparan sulfate. from the cross peaks at  <dig> ,  <dig>  ppm  and those at  <dig>   and  <dig>  ppm  assigned in figure 4c, it is evident that heparan sulfate binds to the arg  residues of p46– <dig>  the interaction of the amino acid val  is evidenced by signals at  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm. furthermore, the interaction of at least one of the thr  residues is evidenced by the resonances arising from γch <dig> , βh , and αh .

discussion
it is well established that adhesion of bacteria to target host tissues is required for colonization and subsequent development of disease  <cit> . since adherence is a key step in microbial pathogenesis, the use of anti-adhesion therapy and anti-adhesion immunity has emerged as an attractive approach toward the development of new tools to control infectious diseases  <cit> . in order to develop anti-adhesive drugs, including adhesin-based vaccines, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which microorganisms initiate host cell colonization is necessary. it has been reported that hlp is a pivotal adhesion molecule in the context of mycobacteria interaction with host cells. it was initially described as a laminin-binding protein whose function was to mediate m. leprae adhesion to schwann cells in conjunction with pgl-i, another laminin-binding molecule present on the surface of m. leprae  <cit> . later on, the capacity of hlp to bind heparin/heparan sulfate became evident along with the relevance of this interaction in the context of m. tuberculosis attachment to respiratory epithelial cells and the potential involvement of this protein in the initial events of host colonization  <cit> .

due to the emergence of hlp as a key component in mycobacterial pathogenesis, a detailed analysis of the molecular regions involved in the interaction with extracellular matrix components was initiated. the first investigation in this direction reported that the region between thr <dig> and phe <dig> was responsible for the interaction of hlp with heparin  <cit> . however, we recently showed that a fragment of the protein corresponding to the last  <dig> amino acids was additionally able to bind heparan sulfate  <cit> . to further define the heparan sulfate-binding sites of hlp in the present study, a panel of 30-mer synthetic peptides derived from the entire sequence of this adhesin was used. three distinct assays were employed to map the regions of hlp/lbp involved with heparin/heparan sulfate interaction: solid phase assays in microplates, heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography, and nmr. the results obtained indicate that hlp interacts with heparin/heparan sulfate in two distinct regions: one located at the n-terminal half of the protein between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  and the other corresponding to the entire c-terminal half of the protein.

the features of hlp heparan sulfate-binding regions herein defined are typical of heparin-binding consensus sequences. as such, they were expected to interact with gags  that fits perfectly into the heparin-binding consensus xbbbxxb sequence  previously defined by cardin and weintraub  <cit> . nmr experiments confirmed that p31– <dig> and p46– <dig>  but not p16– <dig>  were able to bind heparan sulfate. moreover, peptide p31– <dig> was also able to bind tightly to a heparin-agarose column with elution only occurring at high salt concentrations.

a second gag-binding region was characterized at the hlp c-terminal. the 30-mer synthetic peptides p91– <dig>  p106– <dig>  p121– <dig>  p136– <dig>  p151– <dig>  p166– <dig>  and the 20-mer peptide p181– <dig> covering the c-terminal region of m. leprae hlp were also able to bind heparin/heparan sulfate in solid phase assays. two of these peptides, p136– <dig> and p151– <dig>  were also tested for their capacity to bind heparin and heparan sulfate in affinity chromatography and nmr, respectively. as a result, their gag-binding activity was confirmed. all peptides of this region are rich in positively charged residues , which occur singly or in clusters of two, mostly intercalated with ala/val residues. this same spacing pattern of basic amino acids has been found in several heparin-binding domains and seems to facilitate formation of ion pairs with spatially-defined sulfo- or carboxyl-groups in gags  <cit> .

direct nmr observation of the side chain proton resonances that are perturbed upon heparin binding has proven to be a powerful method of identifying the amino acids involved in protein-gag interaction  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, this is the first time that std-nmr has been applied to study the interaction of a ligand  with a nonproteic macromolecule . analysis of the interaction of p31– <dig>  p46– <dig>  p136– <dig>  and p151– <dig> with heparan sulfate by std-nmr led the way to identifying arg, val, thr, phe, lys, and ile as the amino acid residues directly involved in hlp-gag interaction.

the heparin-binding regions for m. leprae hlp herein described only coincide partially with the one previously reported in m. bovis hlp   <cit> . these authors indicated that the sequence between thr <dig> and phe <dig> was the only heparin-binding site present in mdp <dig>  excluding the cluster of arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  and arg <dig> as well as the heparin-binding c-terminal domain of the protein. their finding was based solely on solid phase assays in microplates using 20-mer synthetic peptides covering the entire length of the protein; and no additional experiments based on different techniques were performed to confirm these results. moreover, the discrepancy between the hlp heparin-binding sites cannot be explained by the fact that the hlp proteins analyzed in both studies originated from different mycobacterial species. as shown in figure  <dig>  m. leprae and m. bovis bcg hlp are 84% identical in their amino acid sequences. actually, a multiple sequence alignment shows that the n-terminal heparin-binding region described in this study in addition to the one defined by aoki et al  <cit>  are conserved in all mycobacterial hlp homologues sequenced to date . variations in hlp sequences among mycobacterial homologues are mostly located at the c-terminal region even though the features recognized as important for heparin binding seem to be preserved across the species.

in summary, based on this study and previous observations  <cit> , we propose that there are two distinct heparan sulfate-binding regions in hlp: region i, from thr <dig> to ala <dig> and region ii, spanning lys <dig> to lys <dig> . the identification of arg in region i and lys in region ii confirms the critical participation of positively charged residues and electrostatic forces in mediating gag-protein interaction. moreover, nmr observations showed the direct involvement of val, thr, and phe in region i and ile in region ii, indicating that specific nonionic interactions also take part in hlp-heparan sulfate binding. as has been observed in other gag-protein interactions, it is almost certain that these residues interact with n-acetyl and hydroxyl groups in heparan sulfate through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, respectively,  <cit> .

reinforcing the role of the highly positive c-terminal domain in the interaction of hlp with heparin/heparan sulfate, the heparin binding hemagglutinin , another adhesin implicated in the interaction of mycobacteria with epithelial cells  <cit> , also contains lysine-rich motifs in the c-terminal domain  that have been shown to mediate bacterial adherence via interaction with heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans  <cit> . hbha appears, however, to interact with heparin/heparan sulfate more weakly than hlp  <cit> , suggesting it plays a secondary role in adhesion. indeed, as shown in this study, hlp displays an expanded c-terminal gag-binding domain and an additional heparin-binding region at the n-terminal domain when compared to hbha, which may explain the higher affinity of hlp to gags .

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained indicate that hlp interacts with heparin/heparan sulfate in two distinct regions: one located at the n-terminal half of the protein between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  and the other corresponding to the entire c-terminal half of the protein. both heparan sulfate-binding regions are preserved in all mycobacterial hlp homologues that have been sequenced, suggesting important but possibly divergent roles for this surface-exposed protein in both pathogenic and saprophic species. due to the emergence of hlp as a key component in mycobacterial pathogenesis, and the potential involvement of this protein in the initial events of host colonization, a detailed analysis of the molecular regions involved in the interaction with extracellular matrix components may contribute to the development of new prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions in mycobacterial diseases based on this adhesin.
