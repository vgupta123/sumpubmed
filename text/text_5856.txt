BACKGROUND
recombinase-based cloning technologies are becoming increasingly popular because of their easy use and high efficiency. these tools exploit bacterial or viral site-specific recombinases like the bacteriophage p <dig> cre, the saccharomyces cerevisiae flp or the bacteriophage lambda integrase  <cit> . these enzymes catalyze a reciprocal double-stranded dna exchange between two specific dna sites  <cit> .

gateway  is one of the most popular recombination cloning technologies  <cit> . it is based on the escherichia coli bacteriophage lambda integrase/att system  <cit> . two sets of reactions are employed in this technology: lr and bp recombinations . the bp reaction is catalyzed by the bp clonase enzyme mix , which recombines attb sites with attp sites. the lr clonase mix  is responsible for recombination of attl sites with attr sites. any dna fragment of interest can be pcr amplified with primers containing attb sites and cloned into a donor vector carrying attp sites in the presence of the bp clonase mix. the recombination of attb with attp sites leads to the formation of attl and attr sites. the reaction creates an entry clone bearing the insert of interest flanked by attl sites and a byproduct flanked by attr sites . the insert can then be mobilized into any destination vector having attr sites via an lr reaction . the resulting construct can be easily selected using a combination of a positive  and a negative  selection which does not allow the growth of e. coli transformed with either the initial vectors or the by-product  <cit> . the vast number of gateway destination vectors designed for many different biological analyses and the large collections of entry clones carrying entire genome open reading frames make this technology highly attractive.

a variant of gateway, named multisite gateway , has been developed to facilitate the cloning of multiple dna fragments  <cit> . by using four different attb sites , three pcr products flanked by specific attb sites can be cloned into three donor vectors bearing the corresponding attp sites . the lr clonase plus mix  specifically recombines all attl sites with their corresponding attr sites. a single lr plus reaction with the three entry clones and the pdest-r4-r <dig> destination vector  creates a construct with the three inserts in a defined and oriented order . any gateway entry clone can be mobilized into a multisite gateway destination vector. compared to gateway, multisite gateway is limited by the availability of a small number of destination vectors which prevents this powerful technology from being used for multiple biological purposes.

here we present a method to convert any gateway vector to a multisite gateway vector via a single recombination event.

RESULTS
we decided to take advantage of the large number of gateway single-site destination vectors and developed a new method to easily convert them to multisite gateway. the functional part of multisite gateway destination vectors is the attr4-attr <dig> cassette which can recombine with three gateway donor vectors carrying the appropriate attl sites   <cit> . we constructed a vector, pdonr-r4-r <dig>  to mobilize the attr4-attr <dig> cassette into any gateway destination vector. to create pdonr-r4-r <dig>  we cloned a gateway cassette inside another gateway cassette by choosing a combination of att sites that cannot recombine with one another. we exploited the ability of the bp clonase enzyme mix to recombine attb sites with attp sites while leaving attr sites untouched  <cit> . the attr4-attr <dig> cassette was amplified using attb primers and cloned into pdonr <dig> , a vector carrying an attp1-attp <dig> cassette. the bp recombination created the pdonr-r4-r <dig> vector that contains the attr4-attr <dig> cassette flanked by attl1-attl <dig> sites .

in order to use pdonr-r4-r <dig> to deliver the attr4-attr <dig> cassette into any gateway destination vector in a single lr reaction, we took advantage of the fact that attr <dig> and attr <dig> sites cannot recombine with the flanking attl <dig> and attl <dig> sites   <cit> . to test it, we performed lr reactions with pdonr-r4-r <dig> and three different gateway vectors: pdest <dig> , pdest <dig>  and pmdc <dig>  <cit> . these specific destination vectors were chosen to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. the linearization of pdest <dig> and pdest <dig> inside the gateway cassette and their antibiotic resistance allowed us to specifically select for and recover the entry clones pdest32-r4-r <dig> and pdest22-r4-r <dig> bearing the attr4-attr <dig> cassette flanked by attb1-attb <dig> sites . some destination vectors, like pmdc <dig>  carry the kanamycin resistance gene in discordance with the invitrogen recommendations. in this case, the linearization of the entry clone efficiently works as a negative selector against the non-recombined entry clone. the linearization of pdonr-r4-r <dig> in the vector backbone and pmdc <dig> inside the gateway cassette allowed us to specifically recover pmdc163-r4-r <dig> . the large number of gateway vectors already available for various biological experiments can be easily converted to multisite gateway vectors after an lr recombination with pdonr-r4-r <dig> 

last, we performed an lr plus reaction with pdest22-r4-r <dig> and pdest32-r4-r <dig> to test the functionality of the attr4-attr <dig> cassette flanked by attb1-attb <dig> sites . we used three entry clones bearing a  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp dna fragment cloned into pdonr-p4-p1r , pdonr <dig> and pdonr-p2r-p <dig>  respectively  <cit> . two lr plus reactions were performed with the entry clones and either pdest22-r4-r <dig> or pdest32-r4-r <dig>  both reactions led to the creation of pdest <dig> and pdest <dig> expression clones containing the inserts in the expected order . correct functioning of the technology was further tested by cloning a different set of three entry clones into pdest22-r4-r <dig> . when the converted multisite gateway destination vector bears a kanamycin resistance gene, like pmdc163-r4-r <dig>  the entry clones need to be linearized in order to specifically recover the expression clone.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new method to convert virtually all gateway vectors to multisite gateway. a careful combination of compatible att sites allowed us to use the gateway recombination technology to deliver a multisite gateway cassette. this strategy opens a new way of thinking about recombination sites as cloning and clonable elements at the same time and could apply to other recombination cassettes. our method makes the invitrogen technology available to many biological systems for translational fusion of different proteins or tags, expression of genes or reporter genes under the control of specific promoters and 3'-utrs, and combinatorial analysis of promoters, genes or other dna fragments. our improvement also expands the potential use of this recombination system by utilizing all the features of the large number of gateway vectors already created.
