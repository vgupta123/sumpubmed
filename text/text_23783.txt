BACKGROUND
defining the functional relationships between proteins is one of the important tasks in the post-genomic era. a classical approach to understand gene functional relationships is producing combination mutant in two genes to observe genetic interactions  <cit> . genetic interaction refers to the phenomenon in which the combined effect of mutations of two genes differs from individual effects of each mutation  <cit> . in the extreme cases, mutation of two nonessential genes could lead to a lethal phenotype. this kind of genetic interactions is referred as synthetic lethal genetic interactions . the genome-wide slgis have attracted much attention as they are capable of defining the genome-wide functional relationships between proteins, pathways and complexes  <cit> . the slgis also have potential for finding drug target or drug combinations  <cit> .

representing the structures and functions of proteins, protein domains are usually regarded as building blocks of proteins and are conserved during evolution. the mutation of a gene causes the loss of function of its protein product, which may accredit to the loss of protein domains in the protein product. then, the effect of the mutation of two genes may be caused by the loss of protein domain combinations in both protein products. we refer the phenomenon in which combined effect of mutations of two domains in two proteins differs from individual effects of mutation of each domain as domain genetic interactions. the domain genetic interactions may correlate to slgis. we may use the domain genetic interactions to explain and predict the slgis. furthermore, in multidomain proteins, different domains may fulfill different functions independently or collaboratively. although genetic interaction analysis provides a promising method to understand the functional relationship between proteins  <cit> , we cannot tell the contributions of different domains to certain functionality of multidomain proteins based on their genetic interactions. studying the domain genetic interactions may help elucidate the slgis between multidomain proteins at domain level.

genetic interactions are usually identified by mutant screens  <cit> . recently, high throughput technologies, such as synthetic genetic arrays   <cit>  or synthetic lethal analysis by microarrays   <cit> , have been developed for parallel and massive detection of genetic interactions. however, even with high throughput methods, experimental discovery of slgis is still overwhelming. therefore, it is of interest to computationally predict slgis. several computational approaches have been proposed for the prediction of slgis  <cit>  and various features, such as protein interactions, gene expression, functional annotation, gene location, protein network characteristics, and genetic phenotype, had been utilized by these methods. recently, park et al.  <cit>  also used protein domains as one of the features to predict interactions, including genetic interactions.

in our previous study  <cit> , we performed a cross validation study on predicting slgis using protein domains as features. our support vector machine  classifiers were able to achieve high performance with auc  as  <dig> . these results suggested that using domain information may catch the genetic relationships between proteins. in this study, we first applied the maximum likelihood estimation  approach to estimate the probabilities of domain genetic interactions from yeast slgis. the em algorithm developed by dempster et al.  <cit>  had been used to iteratively compute the maximum likelihood. recently, the mle method had been used to infer domain physical interactions from protein physical interactions  <cit> . we identified significant domain genetic interactions, which rarely overlap with the domain physical interactions from ipfam database  <cit> . we also showed that domains in multidomain yeast proteins contribute to their genetic interactions differently. then, we were able to predict novel yeast slgis using probabilities of domain genetic interactions, which demonstrate the ability of protein domains in predicting slgis. we were also able to apply our predicted yeast slgis to understand the compensatory pathways. a complete description of our results and methods is given in the sections below.

RESULTS
identification of significant domain genetic interactions using maximum likelihood estimation
by assuming the independences among domain genetic interactions, we estimated the probabilities of domain genetic interactions using the maximum likelihood estimation  method. the probability of a domain pair indicates its propensity to genetically interact. the high probability of a domain pair imply that number of slgis including the domain interaction is high comparing to the number of protein pairs including the domain interaction that are not genetically interacted. then, we calculated an evidence score e  <cit>  for each domain genetic interaction to estimate its relative significance. the e scores are not the standard likelihood ratio test as they are calculated using only the positive data  <cit> . the e scores indicate the relative significances of the domain pairs in the slgis. the probability and the e score give different view about the significances of domain genetic interactions. the high probabilities do not always correlate to high e score. for example, there are a large number of protein pairs including a single domain pair. if very few of them are slgis, the probability of the domain pair will be low. however, if that domain pair is the only domain pair in those slgis, it will have high e score. on the other hand, in case there are a large number of protein pairs containing the same multiple domain pairs, if most of the protein pairs are slgis, the probabilities of those domain pairs will be high. however, the e scores of those domain pairs will be relatively low as removing any of those domain pairs will have limited effect on the probabilities of slgis. therefore, we used both the probability and e score to select significant domain genetic interactions.

we first applied the mle approach to the  <dig> genetic interactions with both proteins having protein domains. we were able to assign probabilities and e scores to  <dig>  domain pairs. those domain genetic interactions are available on our website, http://www.genenetworks.net, for searching and downloading. we first selected the significant domain genetic interactions with e scores greater than or equal to  <dig> , which corresponds to an approximate seven fold drop of the probability of slgis if this domain genetic interactions is excluded. then, we selected the domain genetic interactions with probability greater than  <dig>  even though they have low e score values. totally, we obtained  <dig> domain genetic interactions of  <dig> domains. table  <dig> lists top ten domain genetic interactions with the highest e scores. the probabilities of those ten domain genetic interactions vary from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the prefoldin domain dominates in the top ten domain genetic interactions . our results are consistent with the findings of le meur and gentleman  <cit> , in which they showed that the prefoldin complex is in  <dig> of their top  <dig> pairs synthetic multi-protein complexes genetic interactions.

domain genetic interactions rarely overlap domain physical interactions
to investigate the relationship between domain genetic interactions and the domain physical interactions, we compared the  <dig> significant domain genetic interactions with the domain physical interactions from the ipfam database  <cit> . there are  <dig> domain physical interactions of  <dig> domains in ipfam database . among them,  <dig> domain physical interactions of  <dig> domains exist in yeast proteins we studied. there are  <dig> domains in both the genetic and physical interactions. we applied the fisher's exact test in r to examine if domains participating genetic interactions are independent from domains participating in physical interactions. we obtained a p-value of  <dig> , which indicated a significant difference between two sets of protein domains. furthermore, there are only  <dig> domain pairs overlapped between the  <dig> domain physical interactions and  <dig> domain genetic interactions. the fisher's exact test obtained a p-value of  <dig>  which showed that the domain genetic interactions significantly differ from the domain physical interactions. thus, the domain genetic interaction is a new type of relationship among domains and can provide a complementary view about the relationships between domains.

the properties of domain genetic interaction network
to obtain an overview of the domain genetic interactions, we modeled the domain genetic interactions as a network, in which each node represents a domain and each link represents a genetic interaction between two domains. then, we examined the properties of this domain genetic interaction network. the average connectivity of the network is  <dig> . the domain pf <dig>  has the highest connections of  <dig>  the average shortest path among all nodes is  <dig> . comparing the size of nodes, this number is very small. furthermore, the average node clustering coefficient of the network is  <dig> . these properties indicated that the domain genetic interaction network has the small world property  <cit> . the analysis of the connectivity distribution of this network showed a power-law distribution with an exponent degree of  <dig>  , which indicated that the domain genetic interaction network is a scale free network  <cit> . these results demonstrated that the domain genetic interaction network follows the common principles of biological networks  <cit> .

domain genetic interactions in the slgis between multidomain proteins
most proteins are multidomain proteins, which are created as a result of different genetic events, such as insertions and duplications  <cit> . multidomain proteins may have different functionalities due to different domains. our identification of domain genetic interactions helps understand how the domains contribute to functionality defined by the slgis, and then help elucidate the functional relationships between proteins at domain level from their genetic interactions.

we also investigated the domain genetic interactions of slgis between sgs <dig> and other proteins. we found that only the pf <dig>  of sgs <dig> has significant genetic interactions with other domains. the results implied that certain functionality of sgs <dig> may be only due to its hrdc domain, rather than its dead/deah domain and helicase conserved c-terminal domain. previous study showed that the hrdc domain of sgs <dig> is required for its cellular functions involving topoisomerases  <cit> . thus, the domain genetic interaction analysis can help understand how domains contribute to the different functionalities of multidomain proteins.

prediction and validation of genome-wide slgis using protein domains
having established that there is a strong correlation between domain genetic interactions and slgis, we explored to predict the probabilities of protein pairs to be slgis using probabilities of domain genetic interactions. we were able to assign  <dig> protein pairs with probabilities greater than  <dig>  table s <dig>  lists the number of slgis predicted by mle approach at different probability cutoffs. all predicted slgis are hosted on our website for searching and downloading.

we then compared the correlation coefficients of gene expressions of predicted slgis to those of known slgis and those of all possible protein pairs. we used a yeast cell cycle gene expression data  <cit> , which contains  <dig> data points. we calculated the t-score and p-value for the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of predicted slgis and the means of known slgis and the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of predicted slgis and the means of all pairs. the results are shown in table s <dig> . the correlation coefficients of gene expression of predicted slgis with threshold greater than  <dig>  are similar to those of known slgis. the gene expression correlation coefficients of predicted slgis using different thresholds significantly differ from those of all pairs except for slgis with probabilities greater than  <dig> , which have only small numbers of slgis. those results indicated that the correlation coefficients of gene expressions of predicted slgis are similar to those of known slgis, rather than to those of random pairs. recently, it was reported that the slgis are likely to have similar go annotations  <cit> . we studied the distribution of similarities of gene ontology  annotations between predicted slgis and also compared them to those of known slgis and all possible protein pairs. as shown in table s3- <dig> , the mean similarities of go annotations of predicted slgis always significantly differ from those of all pairs. at certain probability thresholds, the mean similarities of go annotations of predicted slgis show no significant differences from those of known slgis. those thresholds are  <dig>  for biological process and cellular component and  <dig>  for molecular function. as the probability thresholds increase, the mean similarities of go annotations also increase, which will make them differ from those of known slgis. the studies of go annotations similarities and expression correlation coefficients showed that the predicted slgis at probability threshold around  <dig>  are similar to experimentally obtained slgis.

novel slgis predicted by mle approach
the mle approach was able to predict novel slgis. table  <dig> lists  <dig> novel slgis  with probability > <dig> . we predicted the myo4/dyn <dig> pair to be slgi with the highest probability of  <dig> . the myo <dig> is one of two type v myosin motors. the other one is myo <dig>  which is known to genetically interact with dyn <dig>  <cit> . among  <dig> slgis,  <dig> slgis are between transcription initiation factor genes and genes from rna polymerase complex. previously, many slgis between transcription initiation factor genes and rna polymerase genes have already been reported  <cit> . we expected our novel slgis to help further elucidate the transcription machine. we then investigated genes involved in cellular response to stresses caused by dna damage. we downloaded a list of  <dig> dna repair and recombination genes from kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> . then, we extracted slgis in which at least one protein of slgi pair are related to dna repair. figure  <dig> shows the dna repair related slgis with probability >  <dig> . of a total of  <dig> slgis,  <dig> slgis are novel. some of new predicted slgis are supported by previous studies. for example, the top <dig> and rad <dig> double mutant has shown extreme synergistic growth defects in a previous study  <cit> . a recent study showed that the rtt <dig> and yku <dig> double mutant exhibits synergistic defects under hydroxyurea treatment  <cit> . the pap <dig> and pol <dig> were also shown to genetically interact at high temperatures  <cit> .

compensatory pathways from predicted slgis
protein pathways are a part of gene network in the cell that can accomplish certain functionality. the slgis have been proposed to have high probability of occurrence in compensatory pathways  <cit> . thus, the slgis within the pathways are rare and the slgis between pathways are significantly abundant. identification compensatory pathways from synthetic lethal genetic interactions can be a powerful way to understanding cellular functional relationships. we expected our new predictions will increase the ability of understanding compensatory pathways. we applied the algorithm of ma  <cit>  to identify compensatory pathways from  <dig> predicted slgis with probability higher than  <dig> . among  <dig> slgis,  <dig> slgis are novel predictions. although ma et al. have shown that physical interactions are enriched in discovered pathways  <cit> , there is no assumption that proteins in those pathways are physically interacting. totally, we obtained  <dig> pairs of compensatory pathways, which include  <dig> proteins and  <dig> slgis. then, we examined the go term co-occurrences in each pathway using the sgd go term finder  <cit> . the go term finder calculated the p-values that reflect the probability of observing the co-occurrence of proteins with a given go term in a certain pathway by chance based on a binomial distribution. among  <dig> compensatory pathway pairs,  <dig> pairs are found significantly enriched go terms with p-value less than  <dig> . all  <dig> pairs of compensatory pathways and their most significant go terms are listed on our http://www.genenetworks.net website.

the pathways on the right of those two compensatory pairs of figure  <dig> a and 4b involve in hr. on the right of figure 4a, the pathway involves three proteins: rad <dig>  rad <dig> and dmc <dig>  the dmc <dig> and rad <dig> are known to form a complex  <cit>  and have roles in recombination  <cit> . rad <dig> and rad <dig> are in the same protein family and it has been shown that rad57/rad <dig> bind with rad <dig>  <cit> . on the right of figure 4b, the pathway involves four proteins: sgs <dig>  rrp <dig>  mre <dig> and rad <dig>  the mre <dig> and sgs <dig> are part of a two-step mechanism to initial hr  <cit> . the rad <dig> plays a major role in the single strand annealing and strand exchange.

another interesting compensatory pathway pair is related to hydroperoxides response in the cell. as shown in figure 4d,  <dig> of  <dig> slgis connecting two pathways are novel predictions. the three proteins  on the right are all thioredoxin peroxidase. they play a role in reduction of hydroperocxides in cytoplasm  and mitochondrion . meanwhile, the five proteins  in the left pathway are related to dna repair. rad <dig>  rad <dig> and mre <dig> are known related to double strand break repair  <cit> . the mdm <dig> and mdm <dig> relate the stability of mitochondrial dna  <cit> . those five proteins may relate to repair the damage created by the hydroperoxides. this compensatory pathway pair implies that removing hydroperoxides or repairing damage is alternative strategies for cells to survive from hydropeoxides.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated that the synthetic lethal genetic interactions between two proteins can be described by the genetic interactions between domains of those proteins. we applied a probabilistic model to successfully identify significant domain genetic interactions. the significant domain genetic interactions rarely overlap with the domain physical interactions from ipfam  <cit> , which suggests that the domain genetic interactions and domain physical interactions are complementary to each other. the domain genetic interactions offer a new understanding of the relationship among domains, and then among proteins. furthermore, with the identified domain genetic interactions, we showed that the contributions of domains in a multidomain protein to its genetic interactions are significantly different. the domain genetic interactions will help to decipher the domains that perform the function related to the genetic interaction. for example, analyzing the domain genetic interactions confirms that only the pf <dig>  of sgs <dig> involve in the cellular functions that are compensatory to topoisomerases.

our identification of domain genetic interactions and prediction of slgis is not complete. first, our training data is limited. it is believed that the available genetic interactions are just a small fraction of the whole genetic interactions  <cit> . second, the training data largely come from several high-throughput genetic interaction screens, which emphasized certain biological processes, such as dna repair. thus, the probability of domain genetic interaction may be effected by the future available slgis. moreover, we should keep in mind that our predicted slgis require further validation to exclude false positives. the mle approach assumes the independence of domain genetic interactions. however, there may be dependence between domain genetic interactions. an apparent extension of this work is to consider the dependences among cooperative domains in multidomain proteins. due to those limitations, the performance of predicting genome-wide slgis using protein domains may be not as good as other classifiers  <cit> .

in summary, our study significantly improved the understanding of different domains in mulitdomain proteins. the identification of domain genetic interactions helps the understanding of originality of functional relationship in slgis at domain level. furthermore, our prediction of slgis expanded the ability to elucidate the functional relationships between proteins and pathways.
