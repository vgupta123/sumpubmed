BACKGROUND
most of the world’s wheat growing areas are frequently subject to heat stress during the growing season. high temperatures adversely affect wheat yield and quality  <cit> . over the past three decades , heat stress has caused a decrease of  <dig> % in global wheat yields  <cit> . thus, research on the molecular mechanism of thermotolerance and the development of new wheat tolerant varieties using classical breeding techniques and biotechnological approaches is increasingly important. as sessile organisms, plants have evolved various response mechanisms to adapt to abiotic stress, particularly molecular responses to maintain normal life activities . genes that respond to adverse growth conditions are essential for enhancing abiotic stress tolerance and developing stress-tolerant crops.

iron is an essential nutrient for all cells. however, excess free iron is harmful to cells because it promotes the formation of free radicals via the fenton reaction. thus, iron homeostasis must be well controlled. as iron-storage proteins, ferritins play important roles in sequestering or releasing iron upon demand  <cit> . ferritins are a class of 450-kda proteins consisting of  <dig> subunits, which are present in all cell types  <cit> . in contrast to animal ferritins, subcellular localization of plant ferritins in the cytoplasm has not been reported. plant ferritins are exclusively targeted to plastids and mitochondria . the model plant arabidopsis contains four ferritin genes: atfer <dig>  atfer <dig>  atfer <dig> and atfer <dig>  hexaploid wheat contains two ferritin genes that map to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and each of the individual homeoalleles can be located to the a, b or d genome  <cit> . thus, ferritin genes are conserved throughout the plant kingdom, and two genes per genome have been identified in all studied cereals  <cit> .

transcriptome analysis of plant responses to stress has identified a number of genes. in plants, ferritin gene expression was induced in response to drought, salt, cold, heat and pathogen infection  <cit> . arabidopsis ferritin genes were induced by treatment with h2o <dig>  iron and abscisic acid ; however, not all four atfer genes were induced  <cit> . ferritin was up-regulated in response to drought in the ssh  cdna library of soybean nodules  <cit> . overexpression of ferritin also significantly improved abiotic stress tolerance in grapevine plants  <cit> .

oxidative damage of biomolecules is a common trait of abiotic stress. if oxidative damage is not well controlled, it can ultimately trigger programmed cell death   <cit> . thus, reactive oxygen species  must be tightly managed by enhancing ros scavenging and/or reinforcing pathways preventing ros production. in addition to buffering iron, previous studies have also revealed that plant ferritins protect cells against oxidative damage  <cit> . however, little information is known about ferritin gene functions involved in tolerance to heat and other abiotic stresses. we previously analysed the genome-wide expression profiles of wheat under heat-stress conditions and identified a large number of genes responding to heat stress, including ferritin genes  <cit> . in the present study, the expression patterns of tafer-5b in seedlings treated by various stress were studied, and the relationship between ferritins and thermotolerance was elaborated.

RESULTS
cloning of a ferritin-encoding gene, tafer-5b, from wheat 
microarray analysis using the affymetrix genechip® wheat genome array indicated that the probe ta. <dig> .s1_x_at was induced  <dig> -fold after high-temperature treatment for 1 h  <cit> . based on the probe sequence, we cloned the full-length open reading frame of this gene  from wheat cultivar “tam107”. the coding sequence shares  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % homology with sequences on chromosomes 5a, 5b, and 5d, respectively, of the recently published wheat cultivar chinese spring  genome . the sequence on chromosome 5b corresponds to the original heat-responsive transcript named tafer-5b. comparison of the amino acid sequences between tafer-5b and ferritin genes from the model plant arabidopsis revealed that tafer-5b is a conserved gene containing the transit peptide domain responsible for plastid localization, an adjoined extension peptide domain involved in protein stability and five helixes  . the amino acid sequence of tafer-5b exhibits  <dig> % identity with atfer <dig>   <dig> % identity with atfer <dig>   <dig> % identity with atfer <dig>  and  <dig> % identity with atfer <dig> , and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed higher identity with the ferritins from maize, rice and barley .fig.  <dig> sequence alignment of tafer-5b and previously reported ferritin genes atfer1- <dig> in arabidopsis. regions corresponding to the ferritin domains are indicated by arrows




the tafer-5b gene is expressed in response to different stress treatments
the expression patterns of ferritin genes in wheat under diverse abiotic stress conditions were analysed by rt-qpcr using gene-specific primers . tafer-5b expression increased significantly and peaked at 3 h after heat treatment at 40 °c. after long-term heat-stress treatment , tafer-5b expression decreased, but increased mrna abundance was maintained . we also analysed the expression level of tafer-5b under peg, h2o <dig> and fe-eddha conditions. tafer-5b expression gradually increased and peaked at 12 h of treatment . these results demonstrate that tafer-5b expression is induced by heat, peg, h2o <dig> and fe-eddha treatment.fig.  <dig> expression pattern of tafer-5b under heat , peg , h2o <dig>  and fe-eddha treatment  as assessed by rt-qpcr. the data represent the means of three replicates ± sd




tafer-5b overexpression in wheat enhances thermotolerance at the seedling stage
to gain insight into the function of tafer-5b, tafer-5b under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter was transformed into wheat cultivar jimai <dig>  by particle bombardment. in total,  <dig> transgenic events were produced, and integration of the ferritin gene was confirmed by pcr analysis with specific corresponding primers. the transgenic lines were analysed over the t <dig> and t <dig> generations. three lines  that exhibited up-regulation of tafer-5b in shoots at the early seedling stage  were selected for further analysis.

growth and stress resistance phenotypes were investigated at the seedling stage grown under normal and heat-stress conditions. under normal conditions, the tafer-5b transgenic lines exhibited no obvious differences . however, under heat-stress conditions, wild type  wilted more rapidly than the tafer-5b transgenic lines after heat stress at 45 °c for 18 h and recovery at 22 °c for  <dig> d. . as a parameter for evaluating stress-induced membrane injury, electrolyte leakage is often used to analyse plant tolerance to stress. thus, we further evaluated electrolyte leakage with detached leaves under heat-stress conditions. the tafer-5b transgenic lines exhibited reduced electrolyte leakage with detached leaves compared with jm <dig> under heat-stress conditions . under heat-stress conditions, photosynthetic activity was markedly reduced and accompanied by direct and indirect photosynthetic system damage. the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence  is an important parameter used to assess the physiological status of the photosynthetic apparatus. environmental stress that affects photosystem ii efficiency decreases fv/fm. previous studies have indicated that disturbance of the electron flow under moderate heat stress might be an important determinant of heat-derived damage of the photosynthetic system  <cit> . fv/fm values in tafer-5b transgenic lines were increased compared with jm <dig> under heat-stress conditions, whereas no significant difference was observed under control conditions . these results indicate that tafer-5b protects photosynthetic activity under heat-stress conditions.fig.  <dig> thermotolerance assay of tafer-5b transgenic wheat plants at the seedling stage. a phenotype of 10-day-old jm <dig> and three tafer-5b transgenic wheat lines, w-l <dig>  w-l <dig> and w-l <dig>  before heat treatment. b 5-day-old jm <dig> and three tafer-5b transgenic wheat lines, w-l <dig>  w-l <dig> and w-l <dig>  were treated at 45 °c for 18 h, and photographs were taken after  <dig> d recovery at 22 °c. c ion leakage assay of the seedlings in  after heat treatment. d maximum efficiency of psii photochemistry  in the seedlings in  after heat treatment at 38 °c for 2 h. the data represent mean values ± sd of three independent experiments. 




arabidopsis ferritin-lacking mutants display heat stress-sensitive phenotypes and are rescued by tafer-5b overexpression
the role of the ferritin gene in thermotolerance in arabidopsis has not been characterized. to determine whether the function of ferritin from mono- and dico-species is conserved, the arabidopsis ferritin gene triple mutant fer1-3- <dig>  and quadruple mutant fer1-2-3- <dig>  were created by crossing the single mutant as described previously  <cit>  . then, we transformed 35s::tafer-5b into wt and fer1-2-3- <dig> plants. detection of protein expression levels by western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of ferritin increased in the overexpression lines  compared with wt  but decreased in fer1-2-3- <dig> and fer1-3- <dig> plants compared with wt . as shown in additional file 6: figure s4b, ferritin protein levels in fer1-2-3- <dig> plants complemented by the tafer-5b gene  were very similar to those in wt plants. no obvious morphological differences were observed in the transgenic lines at different developmental stages .

thus, fer1-2-3- <dig>  fer1-3- <dig>  a-l <dig>  a-l <dig>  a-cl <dig> and wt plants were analysed in further experiments. first, we examined the survival rate of these lines after heat stress. briefly, 7-day-old seedlings grown at 22 °c were subjected to heat-stress treatment at 45 °c for 2 h. after recovery at 22 °c for 7 days, only 10% of fer1-2-3- <dig> and fer1-3- <dig> plants survived, whereas approximately 70% of wt plants survived . as shown in fig. 4b, tafer-5b overexpression functionally complemented the heat stress-sensitive phenotype of fer1-2-3- <dig> plants. in addition, tafer-5b transgenic lines also exhibited an enhanced thermotolerance phenotype compared with wt plants . we further evaluated electrolyte leakage with detached leaves under heat-stress conditions. detached leaves of fer1-2-3- <dig> and fer1-3- <dig> leaked more electrolytes than wt and a-cl <dig> leaves, whereas a-l <dig> and a-l <dig> leaked fewer electrolytes than wt leaves . fv/fm values were a-l2 > a-l1 > a-cl1 > wt > fer1-3-4 > fer1-2-3- <dig> under heat-stress conditions, whereas no significant differences were observed under control conditions . these results also suggest a role of tafer-5b in thermotolerance in arabidopsis.fig.  <dig> 
arabidopsis ferritin-lacking mutants displaying a heat stress-sensitive phenotype were rescued by overexpression of tafer-5b. a 6-day-old seedlings of wt, fer1-3- <dig> and fer1-2-3- <dig> were treated at 45 °c for 2 h, and photographs were taken after 7-d recovery at 22 °c. b 6-day-old seedlings of wt, fer1-2-3- <dig> and a-cl <dig>  were treated at 45 °c for 2 h, and photographs were taken after 7-d recovery at 22 °c. c ion leakage assays of fer1-2-3- <dig>  fer1-3- <dig>  wt, overexpression lines a-l <dig> and a-l <dig> and complemented line a-cl <dig> seedlings after heat treatment. d maximum efficiency of psii photochemistry  of fer1-2-3- <dig>  fer1-3- <dig>  wt, overexpression lines a-l <dig> and a-l <dig> and complemented line a-cl <dig> seedlings at 22 °c and 38 °c. the data represent mean values ± sd of three independent experiments. 




ferritin enhances thermotolerance associated with the ros scavenging
a number of recent studies have suggested that ferritin protects plant cells from oxidative damage induced by a wide range of stress. under normal conditions, the fer1-3- <dig> mutant leads to enhanced ros production and increased activity of several reactive oxygen species  detoxifying enzymes in leaves and flowers  <cit> . these results indicate that fer1-3- <dig> compensates for and bypasses the lack of safe iron storage in ferritins by increasing the capacity of ros-detoxifying mechanisms  <cit> . however, when arabidopsis plants are irrigated with 2 mm fe-eddha, the lack of ferritins in fer1-3- <dig> plants strongly impairs plant growth and fertility. thus, under high-iron conditions, free-iron-associated ros production overwhelms the scavenging mechanisms activated in the fer1-3- <dig> mutant  <cit> . to further determine whether ferritin enhances thermotolerance associated with protecting cells against ros, we evaluated the accumulation of superoxide radical anions  and h2o <dig> under heat-stress conditions. o2− was detected with nitroblue tetrazolium  staining, and h2o <dig> was measured by diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride  staining  <cit> . we also examined the h2o <dig> content and the enzyme activities of catalase  and glutathione reductase  under normal and heat-stress conditions.

in wheat, transgenic lines accumulated less ros than jm <dig> under stress conditions . cat and gr enzyme activities were also positively correlated with ros content . these results indicate that overexpression of tafer-5b in wheat effectively alleviates the accumulation of ros.fig.  <dig> detection of reactive oxygen species  in wheat after heat treatment at 45 °c for 1 h. a o2

tafer-5b overexpression also enhances tolerance to drought stress, oxidative stress and excess iron stress associated with the ros scavenging
as mentioned above, tafer-5b was also induced by peg, h2o <dig> and excess iron treatment , suggesting that tafer-5b may be involved in an intricate network for abiotic stress responses. to investigate the role of tafer-5b in these abiotic stresses, we examined the effect of tafer-5b on drought stress, oxidative stress and excess iron stress tolerance in wheat. the tafer-5b transgenic lines exhibited significantly greater total root length in the presence of 10% peg, 2 mm fe-eddha or  <dig>  mm h2o <dig> . the h2o <dig> content and cat and gr enzyme activities were also dramatically decreased in the tafer-5b transgenic lines . these results suggest that overexpression of tafer-5b in wheat enhances drought, oxidative and excess iron stress tolerance associated with the ros scavenging. in arabidopsis, we also investigated tolerance to the above stresses in fer1-2-3- <dig>  fer1-3- <dig>  a-l <dig>  a-l <dig>  a-cl <dig> and wt plants. after  <dig> d of exposure to 10% peg, 2 mm fe-eddha or  <dig>  mm h2o <dig>  the total roots of the a-l <dig>  a-l <dig> and a-cl <dig> lines were significantly longer than those of wt and fer1-2-3- <dig> . consistent with this result, h2o <dig> content and cat and gr activities were significantly decreased in the a-l <dig>  a-l <dig> and a-cl <dig> lines compared to wt and fer1-2-3- <dig> . these data indicate that tafer-5b is essential for enhancing abiotic stress tolerance associated with the ros scavenging.fig.  <dig> drought, oxidative, excess iron stress tolerance assay and ros accumulation analysis of tafer-5b transgenic wheat plants. a phenotypes of 10-day-old wheat plants overexpressing tafer-5b under control, mannitol, fe-edta and h2o <dig> conditions. b total root length statistics for the roots of the 10-day-old seedlings in . c h2o <dig> content in 10-day-old seedlings in . d the activity of the antioxidant enzyme cat in the seedlings in . e the activity of the antioxidant enzyme gr in the seedlings in . the data represent mean values ± sd of three independent experiments.

tafer-5b overexpression improves the iron content in the leaves but not seeds of transgenic plants
to confirm the function of tafer-5b in improving iron content in transgenic plants, icp-aas was used to analyse the iron concentration. in the shoots of transgenic arabidopsis plants and mutants before bolting, the iron content displayed the same trend as ferritin protein levels , and 10-day-old transgenic wheat plants exhibited similar results . as a major crop, we were more concerned about the iron content in the seeds of transgenic wheat. however, the results revealed no significantly differences in iron content in seeds between jm <dig> and transgenic plants . this finding is consistent with the previous results  <cit> . previous overexpression of gmfer in wheat and rice driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter resulted in improvements in the iron content in the vegetable tissue without significant changes in seeds. supporting this finding, arabidopsis ferritins store only approximately 5% of the total seed iron and do not constitute the major seed iron pool  <cit> .fig.  <dig> iron content in arabidopsis and wheat. a iron content in leaves of 3-week-old tafer-5b transgenic plants, ferritin-lacking arabidopsis mutants and complemented lines in arabidopsis before bolting. b iron content in wheat shoots of 10-day-old tafer-5b transgenic plants. c iron content in dry wheat seeds of tafer-5b transgenic plants. the data represent mean values ± sd of three independent experiments. 




discussion
heat and drought stress have an adverse impact on crop productivity and quality worldwide. plants have evolved various response mechanisms for heat and drought stress, particularly molecular responses, to maintain normal life activities  <cit> . forward and reverse genetics have been applied to identify key molecular factors that facilitate crop acclimation to environmental stress. in this study, we successfully cloned the gene tafer-5b and elucidated its function in tolerance to heat and other abiotic stresses in arabidopsis and wheat.

tafer-5b possesses the typical features of plant ferritins
plant and animal ferritins evolved from a common ancestor gene. animal ferritins contain two types of subunits, referred to as h- and l-chains. all plant ferritins all share higher identity with the h-chains of animal ferritins. in cereals, there are two ferritin genes per haploid genome. in hexaploid wheat, tafer <dig> and tafer <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and three homeoalleles of each gene are located in the a, b and d genomes, respectively  <cit> . similar to other plant ferritin genes, the gene structure of tafer-5b contains seven introns and eight exons . ferritin subunits are synthesized as a precursor, and the n-terminal sequence consists of two domains: the transit peptide and the extension peptide . the transit peptide domain has higher variability and is absent in the mature ferritin subunit; the transit peptide domain is responsible for plastid localization. the adjacent extension peptide domain present in the mature ferritin subunit is involved in protein stability  <cit> . in sea lettuce ferritins, the extension peptide contributes to shell stability and surface hydrophobicity  <cit> . the removal of the extension peptide in pea seed ferritin both increases protein stability and promotes the reversible dissociation of the mature ferritin protein  <cit> . the secondary structure of pea seed ferritin is highly similar to that of mammalian ferritin  <cit> . the ferritin cage structure is assembled from  <dig> individual four-helix bundle subunits  and is conserved in plant and animal ferritins. in plants, which diverged from their animal counterparts, the ferritins also contain a smaller and highly conserved c-terminal e-helix that participates in the formation of the fourfold axis and is involved in electron transfer  <cit> .

the expression of ferritins is modulated by heat stress and other abiotic stresses
in this study, the probe corresponding to tafer-5b was induced by heat stress  <cit> . rt-qpcr analysis demonstrated that this gene was induced by heat treatment and peaked at 3 h of treatment . we also analysed the expression profiles of tafer-4a, tafer-4b, tafer-4d, tafer-5a, tafer-5b and tafer-5d under drought stress, heat stress and their combination in the expression database   <cit> . tafer-5a, tafer-5b and tafer-5d were all induced by drought stress, heat stress and their combination . these results indicate that, in addition to functioning as the iron storage protein in the development stages, plant ferritins may also function as stress-responsive proteins. previous studies have demonstrated that ferritin gene expression is induced by heat treatment. ppfer <dig> expression was significantly induced by 6 h of treatment at 40 °c  <cit> . in barley caryopses, heat treatment at  <dig>  h, 3 h and 6 h could induced the expression of the ferritin gene-corresponding probe barley1_ <dig>  <cit> . in cotton leaves, the expression of the ferritin gene-corresponding probe gra. <dig> .a1_s_at was induced in cultivar sicala <dig> but not in cultivar sicot <dig> after 42 °c treatment. we also analysed the expression profiles of the four arabidopsis ferritin genes after heat stress in the expression database . after 38 °c treatment, atfer <dig>  atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> expression was induced gradually and peaked at 3 h. after recovery to normal conditions, the expression levels of these three genes gradually decreased to normal levels. atfer <dig> accumulates in dry seed. atfer <dig> abundance in vegetative organs is minimal, and its expression is not induced by heat. taken together, we believe that induction of the plant ferritin gene by heat is a common phenomenon and that ferritin genes are involved in coping with heat stress.

we analysed the 2000-bp sequence of tafer-5b upstream of the start codon and did not identify the typical heat stress responsive element  . this result indicates that tafer-5b expression is not regulated by heat transcription factors but by other pathways. we also analysed the promoter region of the four arabidopsis ferritin genes. hses were identified in the promoter regions of atfer <dig>  atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> but not in atfer <dig> . these results indicate that heat transcription factors participate in the regulation of ferritin genes; however, other pathways are also involved because some ferritin genes are induced by heat even though their promoter regions do not have the typical hse.

under drought or other stress conditions, free iron in plants increases rapidly and induces the expression of ferritin to cope with the stress  <cit> . this phenomenon may be a regulatory mechanism to induce the expression of ferritin under heat-stress conditions. in addition, in the oshdac <dig> overexpression lines, ferritin gene expression is decreased  <cit> . atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> are the target genes of atgcn <dig>  and the expression levels of atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> are decreased in the mutant gcn5- <dig>  <cit> . these results indicate that histone modification may be involved in the regulation of the ferritin gene.

some abiotic stress and hormone responsive elements were identified in the promoter sequence of tafer-5b . the expression of tafer-5b was also induced by peg, h2o <dig> and fe-eddha treatment . we also analysed the expression profiles of the four ferritin genes under abiotic stress conditions using the arabidopsis expression database . after cold treatment, only the expression of atfer <dig> was induced. under salt-stress conditions, the expression of atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> was increased 6-fold and 3-fold, respectively, but the expression of atfer <dig> was not altered. under drought-stress conditions, only the expression of atfer <dig> and atfer <dig> was induced. in rice, osfer <dig> was induced by cu, paraquat, snp  and iron  <cit> . ferritin is one of the genes up-regulated in response to drought in the ssh cdna library of soybean nodules  <cit> . these results indicated that ferritin gene expression is induced by various abiotic stress treatments. thus, the regulation of the ferritin gene is very complicated.

ferritin plays an important role in the defence against heat and other abiotic stresses in plants
in this study, we demonstrated that tafer-5b is induced by heat stress and other abiotic stresses. overexpression of tafer-5b in both wheat and arabidopsis enhanced heat, drought, oxidative and excess iron stress tolerance compared with control plants. transgenic tobacco plants ectopically expressing msfer are more tolerant to oxidative damage and pathogens compared with wt plants  <cit> . transgenic grapevine plants overexpressing msfer were used to evaluate the tolerance to oxidative and salt stress  <cit> . what is the mechanism by which plant ferritin improves tolerance to abiotic stress? we evaluated the accumulation of o2− and h2o <dig> in transgenic plants and control under heat stress, which revealed that the transgenic plants accumulated less o2− and h2o <dig>  high temperature induces the production of ros and cause oxidative stress. we hypothesized that when a plant is under oxidative stress caused by high temperature, ferritin transforms toxic fe2+ to the non-toxic chelate complex and protect cells against oxidative stress. when no additional ros scavenging mechanisms are available, the function of ferritin is amplified and plays an important role.

CONCLUSIONS
ferritins are conserved throughout the plant kingdom, and two genes per genome have been identified in all studied cereals. in this study, we cloned tafer-5b from wheat and determined that tafer-5b is induced by heat stress and other abiotic stresses. the relationship between tafer-5b and abiotic stress tolerance was characterized. our results suggest that tafer-5b plays an important role in enhancing tolerance to heat stress and other abiotic stresses associated with the ros scavenging.
