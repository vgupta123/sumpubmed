BACKGROUND
insects appeared more than  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and have been known to be the unprecedented evolutionally successful metazoans on the earth. one of the factors that may contribute to this success is the ability of insects to adapt to almost every ecological niche by virtue of traits such as metamorphosis and flight  <cit> . in the meantime, the radiation of insects into diverse habitats and food sources largely enhanced the risk for them to be exposed to toxic or otherwise life-threatening conditions. insect cyps impact on the ability of insect adaptation to diverse habitats. on one hand, cyps have very important physiological functions during all life stages of insects. they might be involved in the biosynthesis pathway of endogenous compounds, such as molting hormone   <cit>  and juvenile hormone   <cit>  that are the key factors in regulating metamorphosis, development, and reproduction. some insect cyps are also involved in the degradation of pheromones  <cit>  as well as catalysis and hydroxylation of fatty acids  <cit> , which are critical for chemical communication, behavior  <cit>  and metabolism. on the other hand, as a group of environmental response genes  <cit> , some cyps protect insects by detoxifying xenobiotics including synthetic insecticides  <cit>  and plant allelochemicals  <cit> , resulting in the adaption of insects to the chemical stresses. in a way, the functional and evolutionary diversification  of insect cyps has shaped the success of insects.

as microsomal pigments, cyps have an absorption peak at  <dig> nm when reduced and saturated with carbon monoxide  <cit> . the bacterial cyps are water soluble while eukaryotic cyps are membrane-bound proteins located either on the endoplasmic reticulum or the inner mitochondrial membrane. p450s are hemoproteins and act as the terminal oxidases in the monooxygenase system  <cit> . the three components of the p <dig> monooxygenase system are p <dig>  which acts as the substrate binding protein, nadph-cytochrome p <dig> reductase , which transfers electrons from nadph to cyps, and cytochrome b <dig>  which transfers electrons from nadh to cyps in some p <dig> monooxygenase systems as an additional potential electron donor  <cit> .

cyps constitute one of the largest and oldest gene superfamilies that are found in virtually all aerobic organisms  <cit> . insects typically contain tens to more than one hundred individual p <dig> genes in their genomes . genome annotation efforts identified  <dig> cyps in d. melanogaster <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in anopheles gambiae <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in b. mori <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in apis mellifera <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in aedes aegypti <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in culex quinquefasciatus <cit> ,  <dig> cyps in pediculus humanus humanus <cit> , and  <dig> cyps in t. castaneum <cit> . t. castaneum, commonly known as the red flour beetle, is the first beetle having its genome sequenced. t. castaneum is a notorious worldwide pest of stored grains and farinaceous materials  <cit> . it has developed resistance to all five classes of insecticides and fumigants used against it  <cit> . moreover, the functional genomics method, rnai, works systemically in almost every tissue and developmental stage of t. castaneum <cit> . these characters make t. castaneum an ideal insect model for conducting functional genomics, investigating the mechanisms of insecticide resistance, and exploiting potential new insecticide targets for pest control. although several t. castaneum cyps, cyp6bq <dig> <cit> , cyp306a <dig> <cit> , cyp314a <dig> <cit>  had been functionally investigated in our previous studies, the role of the majority of cyps remains largely unknown. here, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of all t. castaneum cyps with genes in other insect species, examined the cyp6bq gene cluster organization, function and evolution, as well as investigated the mitochondrial cyps intron-exon and gene expression patterns which provide platform to understand the evolution and predict the functions of t. castaneum p <dig> genes.

RESULTS
annotation of t. castaneum cyps
total 143 t. castaneum cyps were annotated and analyzed based on the ncbi database , beetlebase  and cytochrome p <dig> homepage . a full t. castaneum p <dig> gene list with the most updated assembly and annotation information including clan, name, accession number, symbol synonyms, map position and amino acid length are provided in the additional file  <dig> <cit> . among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes are putatively functional isoforms, and  <dig> are pseudogenes. these genes fall into four clans, clan  <dig>  mitochondrial clan, clan  <dig>  and clan  <dig> . these four clans are further classified into  <dig> families and  <dig> subfamilies. nine new families were discovered including mitochondrial family cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> clan families cyp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and cyp <dig> clan families cyp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

phylogenetic analysis of t. castaneum cyps
to inspect the evolutionary relationships of cyps among insect cypomes across taxa which might provide evolutionary insight for the genetic distance and function, four phylogenetic trees were constructed with cyps identified in t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, and a. mellifera . t. castaneum p450s cyp <dig> and mitochondrial clans present a high level of 1: <dig> orthology with those from other insect genomes, suggesting functional conservation of these cyps  <cit> . within cyp <dig> clan, two out of eight genes  show precise 1:1:1: <dig> orthologies . in d. melanogaster, cyp303a <dig> encoded by the gene nomph is expressed specifically in the sensory bristles; this gene product is known to play essential roles in the development of external sensory organs associated with the reception of vital mechanosensory and chemosensory stimuli  <cit> . cyp306a <dig> encoded by phantom  and expressed in the prothoracic glands of d. melanogaster and b. mori was demonstrated to be involved in the ecdysteroid biosynthesis  <cit> . in t. castaneum, the cyp306a <dig> mrna levels showed a similar pattern as the ecdysteroids titer during five days after adult emergence in male beetles, indicating a possible function in the ecdysteroid biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the cyp306a <dig> rnai did not block the primary oocyte maturation which is regulated by ecdysteroids in female beetles  <cit> . there are three other clades in cyp <dig> clan for which functions had been investigated. cyp18a <dig> with 26-hydroxylase activity in d. melanogaster is essential for proper insect development  <cit> . the spook/spookier cyps are involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis  <cit>  and cyp15a <dig> was characterized as an ortholog of the juvenile hormone epoxidase in the cockroach  <cit> .

within mitochondrial clan, four out of nine t. castaneum cyps show distinct 1:1:1: <dig> orthologies with genes from other insect species . the three cyps cyp302a <dig>  cyp314a <dig>  and cyp315a <dig> encoded by d. melanogaster halloween genes disembodied , shade , and shadow  respectively are involved in ecdystroid biosynthesis  <cit> . since the t. castaneum cyp302a <dig>  cyp314a <dig>  and cyp315a <dig> share high sequence similarity with those of d. melanogaster, they very likely have similar functions in t. castaneum. the t. castaneum genome contains a single cyp12h <dig> gene in cyp <dig> family that includes genes associated with insecticide resistance in the house fly musca domestica <cit>  and d. melanogaster <cit> .

t. castaneum genome encodes largely expanded cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig>  clans, especially the families  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . genes in these two clans appear to undergo exceedingly species-specific radiations. the cyp <dig> family is evolutionary related to vertebrate cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families  <cit> . t. castaneum cyp <dig> family merely has one cyp6b subfamily. all cyp <dig> genes in t. castaneum and a. gambiae are clustered in one clade within species, whereas cyp <dig> genes in d. melanogaster clustered into several clades in the phylogenetic tree . in dipteran and lepidopteran insects, a number of cyp <dig> genes were shown to be involved in resistance to a wide range of insecticides and detoxification of plant allochemicals through either constitutive overexpression and/or inducible expression in resistant strains  <cit> . in t. casta-neum deltamethrin-resistant qtc <dig> stain, cyp6bq <dig>  a brain-specific p <dig>  is constitutively overexpressed in resistant strain and is responsible for the majority of delta-methrin resistance  <cit> . d. melanogaster cyp <dig> gene, cyp6a <dig>  is expressed in the non-neuronal support cells of olfactory sensilla associated with pheromone-sensing, and its expression level is correlated with the influence of social experience on aggressiveness  <cit> .

t. castaneum cyp <dig> family is the second biggest family in the clan  <dig> . several members in this family are known to be associated with insecticide resistance and metabolism of odorant compounds  <cit> . genes in cyp <dig> clan show high diversity in their sequences and functions. in clan  <dig>  cyp <dig> family is the largest gene family that has members from the vertebrates and insects as well as caenorhabditis elegans <cit> . it is the only family in clan  <dig> that has been studied in other insect species . except cyp4aa <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  cyp4g <dig> have 1:1:1: <dig> orthologs in three other species, all other cyp <dig> genes in t. castaneum are clustered in several clades within species . members of family cyp <dig> in other insects are known to be associated with biosynthesis of endogenous compounds  <cit> , pheromone metabolism  <cit> , and pyrethroid insecticide resistance  <cit> . it is interesting that antheraea yamamai cyp4g <dig> is associated with diapauses in the pharate first instar larvae  <cit> , indicating that the large complement of cyp <dig> cyps might have much more diverse functions beyond what we appreciated, perhaps even more diversified than the cyp <dig> clan  <cit> .

genomic distribution of t. castaneum cyps
to gain a genome-wide view of chromosome location of t. castaneum cyps, a genetic map  was constructed to map the distribution of 99 t. castaneum cyps on  <dig> chromosomes. no p <dig> gene was found in the lg1=x chromosome. majority of cyps  are distributed on six chromosomes lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  locations of  <dig> other cyps on the chromosome remain unknown. it is considered that the formation of the substantial number of cyps genes is due to a series of gene duplication descended from a common ancestral p <dig> gene  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that most of t. castaneum cyps are located on chromosomes in a tandem manner . there are nine clusters, defined as groups containing at least three genes, located on chromosomes lg3- <dig>  lg <dig> and lg <dig>  all the genes in these clusters belong to cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans; cyp <dig> family , cyp <dig> family , cyp <dig> family , cyp <dig> family , and cyp <dig> family . they are remarkable landmarks for the “bloom” of the cypome in cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans  <cit> . only  <dig> out of 99 t. castaneum cyps  present as singletons. the percentage of singleton in t. castaneum cypome is much less  compared with cypomes of d. melanogaster  and b. mori    <cit> .

cyp6bq cluster in t. castaneum
clustering is a common phenomenon in the organization of cyps in insects  <cit> . around 67% of t. castaneum p <dig> genes reside in clusters . the largest cluster containing  <dig> cyp6bq genes with the same orientation is located within a  <dig> kb region on the lg <dig> chromosome. one of the  <dig> members in this cluster, cyp6bq <dig>  had been demonstrated to be responsible for the majority of deltamethrin resistance observed in qtc <dig>  a deltamethrin-resistant t. castaneum strain  <cit> . further studies on the function of other members in the deltamethrin resistance might mirror the origin and evolution of this cluster. the identity matrix of genes in the cyp6bq cluster showed amino acid homology between two cluster members ranging from 52% to 87%, with the exception of cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig> sharing 95% amino acid identity . figure 4a shows the phylogenetic relationships of  <dig> clustered genes . earlier duplication events generated three clans, which we have named clan i, ii, and iii. clan i includes two genes, cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig> with high percent sequence identities suggesting that they may have evolved from a recent duplication event. clan ii includes three genes, cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig>  clan iii consists of  <dig> cluster genes, cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  and cyp6bq <dig>  created by a series of tandem duplications.

the tissue specific expression pattern of genes within the same clan is largely conserved in qtc <dig> strain . the only exception is cyp6bq11; this may imply potentially novel physiological functions for this gene. genomic sequence analysis showed that the  <dig> members of cyp6bq cluster share highly similar intron-exon structures . each gene consists of three exons, with exon one having 1123- <dig> bp, exon two containing about 253- <dig> bp, and exon three consisting of approximately 163- <dig> bp. there are only two exceptions, cyp6bq3p containing a single exon and cyp6bq <dig> containing two exons. the length of intron ranges from about 44 bp to 54 bp. the first introns in all genes follow the canonical gt/ag rule. the differential expression profiles of the cluster genes showed that with the exception of cyp6bq3p and cyp6bq <dig>  all other  <dig> genes have significantly higher mrna levels in qtc <dig> resistant strain than in the lab-s susceptible strain . moreover, six out of these  <dig> genes were induced by deltamethrin  after  <dig> h exposure to the chemical  suggesting a potential contribution of these cluster members to the deltamethrin resistance in qtc <dig> strain.

then we focused on four evolutionarily close genes, cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig>  we cloned the full length sequences of these four genes from lbs, ga and qtc <dig> strains and deposited them in the genbank . then we conducted homology modeling and ligand docking studies. the protein models for cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig> showed the p <dig> structurally conserved helices d, e, i, l, j, and k along with β sheets  <dig> and  <dig> . we used autodock vina to investigate the binding of four insecticide compounds ddt, imidacloprid, permethrin, and deltamethrin . for each predicted binding mode, estimated binding affinity and insecticide putative hydroxylation site distance from the heme iron were compared. the lowest binding energy observed was for cyp6bq9-pyr and deltamethrin with the 4′ carbon hydroxylation site adjacent to the heme iron . all models demonstrated favorable binding affinity and a putative substrate hydroxylation site within  <dig>  Å  <cit>  of the heme iron with two or more of the insecticides tested . relevant binding modes for cyp6bq11-pyr were found for all four insecticides suggesting an association with resistance to all four insecticides . docking modes for deltamethrin are shown in figure  <dig>  residues in the catalytic pockets of cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig>  cyp6bq <dig> and cyp6bq <dig> within  <dig>  Å of deltamethrin were examined. hydrophobic residues phe <dig>  phe <dig>  val <dig> or leu <dig> and hydrophilic lys <dig> were conserved in the catalytic site of at least three proteins. the active sites of all four models are rich in phenylalanine and other hydrophobic residues  suggesting these four proteins provide a favorable chemical environment for hydrophobic insecticide compounds. although the lowest binding energy was observed for cyp6bq9-pyr and deltamethrin, which is consistent with our previous study about the major function of cyp6bq <dig> in deltamethrin resistance of qtc <dig> beetles  <cit> , the predicted catalytic sites are well conserved among cyp6bq <dig> variants in lbs, ga and qtc <dig> strains . the predicted binding affinities to deltamethrin and insecticide putative hydroxylation site distance from the heme iron do not differ much among cyp6bq <dig> variants in these three strains . these observations further suggest that the involvement of cyp6bq <dig> in deltamethrin resistance of qtc <dig> strain is not due to changes in binding affinity but is likely due to an increase in the expression of this gene. the mechanism of regulation of cyp6bq <dig> expression in the qtc <dig> strain is currently under investigation.

mitochondrial cyps in t. castaneum
the mitochondrial cyps form a unique branch in the phylogenic tree of animal cyps  <cit> . to date, mitochondrial cyps are only found in animals, but not in fungi and plants  <cit> . there is a minor group in the total p <dig> family members of animals compared with the microsomal cyps. in t. castaneum, only nine out of  <dig> cyps are found in mitochondria. in vertebrates, mitochondrial cyps are generally specialized in the metabolism of steroid or vitamin d, in contrast with microsomal cyps that show considerably extensive substrate specificities  <cit> . whereas, insect mitochondrial cyps show somewhat structural and functional diversity, which suggests that they have undergone several blooms  <cit> . there are at least two groups of mitochondrial cyps in insects. one is cyp <dig> family including variable number of genes across different taxa that are rapidly evolving  <cit> . three cyp12a genes were cloned from the house fly  <cit> . among them, cyp12a <dig> is constitutively overexpressed in diazinon resistant strain and metabolizes insecticides and other xenobiotics but not ecdysteroids. d. melanogaster has seven cyp <dig> members in its cypome . the overexpression of cyp12a <dig> in a natural population confers the lufenuron resistance  <cit> . cyp12d <dig> was observed to be overexpressed in a ddt-resistant strain and induced by xenobiotics  <cit> . there are four cyp12f genes in a. gambiae cypome . it was reported that cyp12f <dig> is constitutively overexpressed in both ddt-resistant strain  and permethrin-resistant strain   <cit> . the close association with xenobiotic resistance in the group of insect cyp <dig> genes demonstrates the evolutionary differentiation between insects and vertebrates. the other group of insect mitochondrial cyps show sequence conservation  and include three halloween genes that are the orthologs of the c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> hydroxylases that function in the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids  <cit>  as well as genes with unknown functions. these genes are considered to perform essential physiological functions during insect development and reproduction  <cit> .

to predict the functions of t. castaneum mitochondrial cyps, temporal expression of these genes was determined . metamorphosis in holometabolous insects is regulated by cross-talk between ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones. our previous studies showed that the ecdysteriod titers remain low throughout the final instar larval stage except for small increases at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after ecdysis into the final instar larval stage  <cit> . the ecdysteriod titers showed another peak during the quiescent stage. afterward the levels remain low at the beginning of the pupal stage and increase again beginning at  <dig> h after ecdysis into the pupal stage and eventually reached the maximum levels by  <dig> h  <cit> . the mrna levels of nine mitochondrial cyps during the final instar larval stage , quiescent stage , pupal stage , and adult stage  were quantified and normalized using rp <dig> mrna levels as the most stable reference gene   <cit> . cyp12h <dig> is only expressed in the final instar larval stage which might point out that its function is restricted to this stage. the mrna level of shd  increased at the late period of the final instar larval stage at the time of the ecdysteriod increases. the expression of sad  showed two peaks during the late periods of the final instar larval stage and pupal stage when the ecdysteriod titers reach the maximum levels . the mrna levels of cyp334b <dig> remained low until the late period of the pupal stage and afterward high levels were detected during the adult stage. the expression level of cyp353a <dig> increased during the final instar larval stage and reached a peak in ld <dig> and then pd <dig> and subsequently decreased during the pupal and adult stages. cyp302a <dig> gene is expressed ubiquitously.

the intron–exon organization of t. castaneum mitochondrial cyps is also investigated which may help to understand the evolution of these genes as well as the origin of introns and genes  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  intron-exon organization of all nine t. castaneum mitochondrial cyps is highly diverse. the number and length of introns vary extensively among these genes. for example, cyp301b <dig> contains nine small introns, whereas cyp315a <dig> has only two introns. other members contain 3- <dig> introns. three halloween genes share well conserved intron-exon positions among the different groups of orthologous genes  <cit> . however, t. castaneum cyp314a <dig> and cyp315a <dig> have undergone significant intron losses when compared to their orthologous genes. the massive intron loss is considered as a result of an evolutionary selection for compaction of insect genomes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, integrated studies including annotation, phylogenetic analysis, gene expression as well as molecular modeling and docking were conducted for t. castaneum cyps.  <dig> cyps were identified and classified into  <dig> clans,  <dig> families and  <dig> subfamilies suggesting the cyp number in t. castaneum is three fold higher than honeybee and body louse, substantially higher than d. melanogaster and a. gambiae but significantly lower than a. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus. the relatively large cyp gene superfamily in t. castaneum may contribute to the remarkable ability of insecticide resistance in this beetle. current studies provided insights into the evolution of t. castaneum cyp gene superfamily and developed a valuable resource for the functional genomics research which will help to understand the strategies employed by insects to cope with their environment and to exploit potential new insecticide targets for pest control.
