BACKGROUND
a number of different methods have been developed in arabidopsis thaliana to discover and analyze promoters that are regulated by tissue specificity or environmental conditions  <cit> . these include the use of reporters gus, gfp and more recently luciferase  <cit>  to detect "trapped" dna elements that confer some type of regulation. individual reporters and the exact type of trap system  each have their biases as to the type of expression element which is more frequently identified as well as their own advantages and disadvantages, which have been previously reviewed  <cit> . of the available technical approaches, in the activator/upstream activating sequence  bipartite system, a transcriptional activator  is used to trap endogenous enhancers. transcription factor expression is detected using a reporter gene with the appropriate upstream uas. this system has the advantage of using trapped lines to subsequently drive the ectopic expression of introduced transgenes. trapping enhancer elements using the gene for the activator gal <dig>  which subsequently activates a reporter such as lacz , has been very successful in yeast and drosophila  <cit> . the consequence for the fruitfly community has been the generation in the last ten years of well-defined drosophila trap lines that show developmental or tissue specific expression of gal <dig>  <cit> . these lines can then be used for expression studies with a reporter, typically lacz or gfp, but also as driver lines to ectopically express any gene of interest that is placed downstream of the gal <dig> uas  <cit> .

enhancers are dna regulatory elements that function over variable distance to alter the level of gene expression. an enhancer is generally not sufficient for gene expression and requires minimal promoter elements for transcription initiation. enhancer elements provide much of the spatially, temporally and environmentally regulated gene expression in plants. gal <dig> trap lines in arabidopsis which allow rapid and quantitative analysis of gene expression levels will provide a valuable resource for understanding both tissue-specific and environmental regulation of gene expression. as a beginning, haseloff has described a potential gal <dig> trap system that uses a 5xuas gfp , whereby some arabidopsis lines showed expression in the roots . the purpose of the present report is to describe the plasmids, silencing properties, and validation of gal4-specific expression of our trap library in arabidopsis. to develop an ideal gal <dig> trap system, the reporter should be quantitative, sensitive and stable over generations. because of its long half-life, gfp is rarely used as a reporter for environmental gene regulation, and it is less feasible to perform quantitative expression studies with gfp in planta. we used luciferase as the primary reporter in this study, based on the short half life of luciferase and for its sensitivity and screening capabilities  <cit> .

it was recently reported that in tobacco the gal <dig> system is poorly expressed  because the high methylation status of cytosines  impairs the binding of gal <dig> to the uas  <cit> . . the gal <dig> binding site  typically contains ggcn11ccg and it is predicted from crystal structure studies that methylation would prevent binding  <cit> , and methylation has been shown directly to inhibit binding  <cit> . the study in tobacco employed a  <dig> or 10x uas repeat and the authors suggested that with less uas repeats the affect due to methylation inhibition of gal <dig> binding might be less, although this was not tested. a. thaliana possesses only 5% cytosine methylation  <cit>  but the properties of a gal <dig> trap system in this organism have not been documented in the primary literature. a previous study in arabidopsis by guyer et al used a 10xuas-gus reporter with a full 35s promoter driving gal <dig>  <cit> . this study indicated that trans activation was feasible and no problems of silencing or methylation were noted. a question then remains whether arabidopsis  might be candidates to develop gal <dig> trap systems for regulation or ectopic expression studies. the major goals of the present study were to 1) use a 5xuas-luc as reporter and determine if gal <dig> driven by the full 35s promoter confers constitutive luciferase expression compared to a minimum 35s ; 2) determine whether a 5xuas in arabidopsis is optimal ; 3) determine stability of luciferase trap lines from seedling to seedling and over generations ; 4) produce a trap library with the potential for screening of three reporters , each activated by gal <dig> 

RESULTS
t-dna vectors for gal <dig> studies using a 5xuas-luc reporter
the enhancer trap vectors constructed to examine the feasibility of a gal <dig> activator/uas system in arabidopsis are diagrammed in fig 1a and 1b and sequences upstream of the gal <dig>  luc+ , and rsgfp-gus genes are shown in fig 1c. the first vector, prgk <dig>  has the full 35s promoter , including 35s enhancers, directly upstream of the gal <dig> orf. . the trap vector, prgk <dig>  only contains the minimum 35s tata region. both vectors possess the t-dna right border directly upstream of the gal <dig> promoter regions . the bar gene encoding basta resistance was chosen for ease in selection of transgenic plants grown in soil. the luc+ gene was inserted downstream of the minimum 35s and a 5xuas .

if the trap system functions in a gal4-dependent manner, it is expected that the vector with the e35s promoter driving gal <dig> expression  should show higher luciferase activities in planta than transformants with prgk <dig> . initially, approximately  <dig> seeds from transformed plants were sowed, sprayed with basta, and  <dig> days later sprayed with luciferin and imaged. fig  <dig> shows an image of luciferase activity  from these pots. a pot with control plants  not sprayed with basta is shown on right. as expected, no columbia plants exhibited luciferase activity. all basta-resistant plants transformed with prgk <dig> showed luciferase expression and approximately half of the basta-resistant prgk <dig> plants showed luciferase expression at the detection level shown. this validated that the luciferase gene can be expressed from both vectors. basta-resistant seedlings were transplanted  and  <dig> days later luciferase activities were measured in planta. relative levels in each seedling are shown in fig  <dig>  where zero delineates the columbia control . in this experiment, for prgk <dig> transformed plants,  <dig> out of  <dig>  could be observed as expressors from digitized images of expression . the remaining two still had significant luciferase expression . a profile of the plants transformed with prgk <dig>  is shown in fig  <dig>  approximately 50% were observed on digitized images and had activity above  <dig> relative units. the average luciferase activity for prgk <dig> plants was  <dig> units and for prgk <dig> plants was  <dig> units. thus, the plants appear to depend on the expected gal <dig> expression levels for the luciferase expression. taken together, both the higher percentage of seedlings which express luciferase and the higher level of expression observed with gal <dig> expression from prgk <dig> compared to prgk <dig>  suggests that this luciferase activity is dependent on the gal <dig> expression.

similar experiments were performed with seedlings at earlier stages of growth and agar media was used to examine luciferase activities in roots and aerial tissues. eight day old seedlings were transferred after selection to agar plates containing ms medium with  <dig> um luciferin and, after  <dig> hours, imaged for luciferase activity . visible images of plants are shown in black on an artificial green background  and the luciferase activities superimposed , such that red or yellow indicate luc expression. all but two seedlings with prgk <dig> showed expression of luciferase in roots and cotyledons. only  <dig> out of  <dig> prgk <dig> plants showed expression in roots and  <dig> out of  <dig> in cotyledons. the variability in tissue specificity suggests that "trapped" enhancer elements drive gal <dig> in the prgk <dig> plants. quantitation of luminescence in each seedling from a similar experiment is shown in fig  <dig>  average luciferase activities in plants transformed with prgk <dig> were  <dig> units and with prgk <dig> were  <dig> units, again showing that expression is higher in plants that contain gal <dig> driven by the e35s promoter.

we determined inheritance ratios of the basta and luc expression in t <dig> generations from the trap lines . in a pool of t <dig> seeds,  <dig> out of  <dig> seedlings  died on basta selection, suggesting a 3: <dig> overall inheritance of basta selection, as expected if the majority of transgenics are at a single locus. in a pool of t <dig> seeds under no selection,  <dig> out of  <dig> seedlings had luminescence when sprayed with  <dig> mm luciferin. variations from one seedling to another in t <dig> generations of selected lines were also quantified. fig  <dig> shows two examples of lines that were evaluated. t <dig> seedlings that were not under basta selection  were either heterozygous, homozygous or did not have the basta gene due to segregation. as expected, if basta resistance was lost, luciferase activity was also absent . homozygous lines gave consistent expression from seedling to seedling with respect to luciferase levels and tissue specificity. this suggests that lines can be maintained as homozygotes and expected to express consistently within the t <dig> generation.

use of a 5xuasrsgfp-gus secondary reporter and testing whether 5x, 2x, or 1x uas repeats are better in arabidopsis
often, a secondary reporter  is useful for confirmation of a regulatory property or as an additional tool in understanding the expression of a gene. gfp and gus reporters have their own advantages in use as reporters, so a system was developed that would potentially accommodate the use of all three reporters , each activated by gal <dig>  a gfp-gus fusion protein  was used for these studies . additionally, we wanted to determine whether a 1x, 2x, or 5x repeat would be better in arabidopsis. a report by johnstone and colleagues  <cit>  has suggested that in yeast varying the numbers of uas repeats can affect the "reporter" sensitivity with respect to levels of gal <dig>  as indicated above  <cit> , it could also be advantageous to have fewer uas repeats in plants because of the methylation silencing phenomenon.

arabidopsis was transformed with the three rsgfp-gus vectors  diagrammed in fig 1b. these are based on pcambia <dig>  but the gfp was mutated to red-shifted gfp for higher quantum yield  <cit> . the serine at amino acid position  <dig> was changed to threonine by pcr based mutagenesis. the indicated uas regions  were cloned upstream . columbia plants were transformed and selected with hygromycin. next, we transformed the gal <dig> vectors into various rsgfp-gus transgenic lines to determine qualitatively which lines  expressed more gfp and/or gus. table  <dig> shows a qualitative assessment of their gus activities in random transgenic plants possessing either a 1x, 2x, or 5x uas and the gal <dig> t-dna. as expected, plants without t-dna containing gal <dig> did not express gfp, and the large majority did not express gus or did so at low levels. the only combination that showed a majority of lines with high gus activities were those with a 5xuas rsgfp-gus and the full e35s driving gal <dig> . some of these latter lines also exhibited gfp expression . the 1x and 2x uas lines showed weaker expression patterns and were therefore unsuitable for our future assays. we selected a single locus  line, named rgk <dig>  that had high gus and gfp which lost both activities when the gal <dig>  was segregated out in the next generation. a homozygous rgk <dig> line for this 5xuas rsgfp-gus reporter was chosen as the parent strain for producing a library using the prgk <dig> trap vector . the results with different numbers of uas repeats indicate that in arabidopsis the 5xuas is optimal under the experimental methods described. additionally, these qualitative data are consistent with the hypothesis that gal <dig> levels dictate expression from the 5xuas reporters.

silencing of the gal <dig> system in arabidopsis
to determine the frequency and properties of silencing in the gal <dig> transgenics, we chose random lines of the prgk <dig> and prgk <dig> that exhibited significant luminescence in t <dig> seedlings and quantified expression in seedlings from t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> generations. initial studies on nine prgk <dig> and nine prgk <dig> lines indicated that no major drop in luc expression from generations t <dig> to t <dig> occurred , with some lines decreasing and some increasing, but typically not by more than two to three fold.

a study of prgk <dig>  basta resistant lines was carried out on t <dig>  t <dig>  and t <dig> generations, where all three generations were grown on the same plates and assayed for luciferase activity . again, the changes from t <dig> to t <dig> were typically less than  <dig> fold. however, some lines were dramatically silenced when comparing the t <dig> to t <dig> generations:  <dig> out of  <dig>  showed more than a  <dig> fold decrease in luc expression with  <dig> out of  <dig>  showing a greater than  <dig> fold decrease in expression in the t <dig> generation . genetic analysis to determine the number of loci in these selected lines was based on t <dig> plant basta resistance/sensitivity ratios. approximately 25% had an insert at a single locus, 50% had two loci and 25% had more than two loci. there was no correlation between silencing and number of inserts.

to determine whether this dramatic decrease in expression is due to methylation, seedlings from the t <dig> generation of each silenced line were grown in media with and without 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine , an inhibitor of dna methyltransferase. a silenced prgk <dig>  line was also included in this study. in each of the lines, every seedling was recovered for luc expression when grown on  <dig> ug/ml aza . quantitation of luciferase activities indicated that the highest recovered expression was with the prgk <dig> line, and in general expression was directly proportional to the luc activity observed in the t <dig> generation . this suggests that recovery is proportional to the levels of gal <dig> expected in the cell and that silencing is due to methylation, possibly at the level of the 5xuas .

silencing from t <dig> to t <dig>  generations could occur at the level of gal <dig> or the 5xuas-luc transcription. to investigate this, mrna was prepared from seedlings of various generations of selected lines immediately after imaging for luciferase activity. multiplex q-rt-pcr was used to determine the levels of gal <dig> and luc mrna in these samples. based on the constitutively expressed ubc- <dig> gene, mrna levels were determined. the levels of luciferase activity, gal <dig> mrna, and luc mrna are reported in table  <dig>  control lines  that show only a minor decrease in luciferase activity also exhibited little change in gal <dig> and luc mrna. line 65l-4b is silenced mainly at the level of the 5xuas luc, while lines 50- <dig>  80- <dig> and  <dig> are silenced at the level of gal <dig> and 5xuas luc transcription. thus, both classes of silencing are observed .

library construction
with the single locus homozygous line rgk <dig>  we have generated a library of approximately  <dig>  events using the prgk <dig>  vector. data reported in the previous section suggests that about 25% of the silenced lines will be silenced mainly at the 5xuas luc); a potential advantage to using the single locus line as recipient is the potential for less silencing in subsequent generations for the 5xuas rsgfp-gus , suggesting that there are no deleterious effects due to the expression of luc, rsgfp, gus, gal <dig>  or bar in the library.

CONCLUSIONS
a reliable, quantifiable enhancer trap system based on an activator/uas approach in arabidopsis was the principal aim of this research. the gal <dig> activator was selected as the trans-activator for our system. while the gal <dig> system in drosophila has been quite useful, previous studies in tobacco revealed technical hurdles, such as methylation-induced silencing. in the tobacco study, a  <dig> or 10xuas was used to drive gus expression and gal <dig> was expressed from a full 35s promoter  <cit> . tobacco transgenics with this vector showed gus expression in only  <dig> out of  <dig> lines , quite different than the greater than 94% we observed here . additionally, specific tobacco transgenic expressor lines showed more than  <dig> fold variability in gus expression from seedling to seedling, unlike with arabidopsis shown here. results with tobacco were shown to be erratic due to methylation of the uas repeats, certainly a ramification of the high methylation frequency  in that species  <cit> . although we have not compared results using a 10xuas repeat, a 5xuas appears to be better suited for expression than a 1x or 2x uas in arabidopsis. we have proven that silencing by methylation in arabidopsis will occur by the 4th generation in approximately 25% of the lines. on the other hand, 75% of lines retain expression through the t <dig> generation in our study . moreover, t <dig> seedlings appear to retain expression and for many applications this may be sufficient.

a general conclusion suggested from our study is that the higher the methylation status of an organism, the less useful a gal4-type system will be, regardless of the number of uas repeats employed. a very recent report  <cit>  indicates "that gal4/vp16-uas elements provided a useful system for enhancer trap in rice". this is somewhat surprising because rice is approximately 19% methylated  <cit> . wu et al. used a 6xuas-gus reporter and the gus expression frequency in the initially transformed generation, called t <dig>  was quite impressive   <cit> . t <dig> generation plants had similar expression levels and tissue specificities , suggesting few effects due to methylation. no generations past the t <dig> were evaluated. the authors suggest that using a 6xuas rather than 10xuas, among a few other technical differences, might explain the lack of problems associated with methylation in rice when compared to that in tobacco  <cit> . later generations in the rice system may begin to show silencing properties. different species may also exhibit silencing effects due to methylation at different generations, and certainly the copy number of inserts will impact the silencing properties. based on their results with tobacco, moore and colleagues developed a different uas bipartite system in which a modified lac repressor dna-binding domain was combined with the gal <dig> activation domain   <cit> . this was at least proven technically feasible in tobacco and very recently, this has been applied to arabidopsis to ectopically drive expression of a selected gene  <cit> . in this case, the driver lines expressed lhg <dig> from cloned promoter elements. a bipartite system that uses an ethanol-responsive alcr activator with the alca promoter for transactivation has recently been reported  <cit> . this system requires exogenous ethanol and also has been combined with tissue-specific promoters driving alcr expression. this "ethanol switch" provides certain advantages, as described <cit> , and will have its own unique applications for driver line studies. we conclude from our results that random trapping using the more common gal4:vp <dig> results in 25% silencing by the t <dig> generation but that much of this silencing may be at the level of the gal4:vp <dig> transgene expression . this suggests that any t-dna delivered trap library  will result in some silencing in arabidopsis and that methylation of the 5xuas is not a major drawback.
