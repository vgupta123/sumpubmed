BACKGROUND
the complete growth and development of chickens is mainly dependent on the “hypothalamus-pituitary-target organ” pathway  <cit> . depending on the needs of the body, the hypothalamus secretes growth hormone-releasing hormone and somatostatin. these play dual roles in the modulation and control of pituitary and growth hormone  secretion  <cit> . gh circulates back to the liver via the blood and complexes with the gh receptor  on the liver cell surface to initiate intracellular signaling mechanisms that promote the expression of insulin-like growth factors . igfs circulate to the local tissues of the body through the bloodstream and promote cell growth and differentiation  <cit> .

skeletal muscle is the major target organ of gh. gh can act directly on the ghrs of skeletal muscle, producing paracrine and autocrine igf- <dig> to regulate muscle growth and development  <cit> . hodik and vasilatos-younken et al. showed that chicken gh can affect skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation, regulates skeletal muscle abundance, and is involved in muscle metabolic regulation  <cit> . ghr is part of the gh-ghr-igf growth axis, which regulates the expression of igfs by mediating gh. thus, it plays a role in regulating skeletal muscle growth and development.

studies indicate that the sex-linked dwarf chicken  phenotype is caused by a mutation in the ghr gene. point and deletion mutations, structural gene mutations, and mutations within the ghr regulatory region are all thought to be involved in conferring the sld phenotype  <cit> . of all these types of mutations, the deletion mutation is believed to be the main cause of this phenotype. agarwal et al. found that that the deletion mutation exhibited a  <dig> -kb deletion between exon  <dig> and the 3' untranslated region  of ghr <cit> . the mutation results in a decrease in the number of muscle fibers and fiber diameter  <cit> . dwarf chickens also present with increased carcass lipid content, which could be a result of increased lipogenesis and decreased energy expenditure  <cit> . another study suggested that in laying hens, dwarfism reduces the adipose tissue lipid mobilization and likely also reduces de novo lipogenesis in the liver  <cit> . expression of ghr mrna is significantly up-regulated in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens  <cit> .

dwarf phenotypes have been found in humans, mice, cattle, pigs, and other mammals  <cit> . among them, the most studied is laron syndrome in humans. laron syndrome is familial dwarfism that was first reported in  <dig>  in which the serum gh level is normal, but igf- <dig> levels are low  <cit> . many studies have indicated that most cases of human laron syndrome are caused by defects in ghr. various types of mutations have been noted in ghr, leading to ghr extra-cellular domain inactivation. all of these can affect the binding of ghr and gh, and leads to interruption of gh signal transduction and a subsequent inability for gh to play its normal role  <cit> .

karen et al. found that the lifespan of mice was significantly prolonged after ghr was knocked out, but that growth was retarded. while igf- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  igfbp- <dig>  and igfbp- <dig> levels were significantly lower, igfbp- <dig> levels were significantly increased, indicating that ghr defects led to gh signal transduction obstruction, significantly affecting phenotype  <cit> . mavalli et al. found that defective skeletal muscle development in both ghr and igf-1r mutants was attributable to diminished myoblast fusion and associated with compromised nuclear factor import and activity in activated t cells. both mutants exhibited impaired skeletal muscle development, characterized by reductions in myofiber number and area as well as accompanying deficiencies in functional performance  <cit> .

the above studies indicated that mutations in ghr could lead to the obstruction of normal human and animal skeletal muscle growth and fat deposition by causing gh signal transduction obstruction. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of ghr and its regulation of chicken skeletal muscle growth and fat deposition remain unclear.

recently micrornas  have been reported to be widespread endogenous noncoding rna molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . in cells, mirnas pair with a complementary target sequence in target mrna 3' utr to mediate the regulation of target gene expression  <cit> . these mirnas are thought be involved in a series of important life processes, including development, neural differentiation, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and fat metabolism  <cit> . using the loss- and gain-of-function method, kwon et al. showed that mirna- <dig> of the ancient muscle-specific gene in drosophila regulates functions of the heart and muscle-specific genes via their interaction with members of the notch signaling pathway  <cit> . clop et al. found that a point mutation within the 3' utr of gdf <dig> in texel sheep resulted in a target site that allowed mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> to act simultaneously. this caused a reduction in the expression of the mirna-mediated myostatin gene  post-transcriptionally, leading to muscle hypertrophy  <cit> . chen et al. demonstrated that mir- <dig> promotes differentiation of myoblasts into mature muscle cells by acting on hdac <dig>  inhibiting myoblast proliferation. the mirna mir- <dig> promotes myoblast proliferation through the srf gene, inhibiting myoblast differentiation  <cit> . these studies have suggested that there is further scope for understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate ghr expression.

in our study, we applied microarray technology to determine the mirna and mrna expression profiles in the skeletal muscles of dwarf and normal chickens at different stages of development. critical mirnas associated with ghr expression and the ways in which they regulate skeletal muscle growth and fat deposition were identified.

RESULTS
differential mirna expression profiles in skeletal muscle of dwarf and normal chickens
using signal values greater than  <dig> as the standard, a total of  <dig> mirnas were detected in  <dig> % of skeletal muscles of 14-day-old embryos from dwarf chickens. in normal chickens,  <dig> mirnas were detected at a rate of  <dig> %. at 7 weeks of age,  <dig> mirnas were detected in the skeletal muscles of dwarf chickens at a detection rate of  <dig> %, with  <dig> mirnas detected in the skeletal muscles of normal chickens .

expression profiles were significantly different in four mirnas between the two different types of chickens . in 14-day-old embryos, expression of both mir- <dig> and mir-181b was significantly down-regulated in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens. expression of let-7b and mir- <dig> in 7-week-old chickens was significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively.

notenote: fold change means the change in let-7b’s expression as compared normal with dwarf chickens.

differential mirna expression profiles in skeletal muscle at different developmental stages
expression of  <dig> mirnas was up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas down-regulated in 7-week-old dwarf chickens as compared with 14-day-old embryos. expression of seven mirnas was up-regulated and nine mirnas down-regulated in normal 7-week-old chickens compared with 14-day-old embryos. of the differentially expressed mirnas, expression of let-7b, mir-30a-5p, mir-30b, mir-99a, and mir-133b was commonly up-regulated in both dwarf and normal chickens. the expression of mir-16c, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> was commonly down-regulated .

differential mrna expression profiles in skeletal muscle of dwarf and normal chickens
a total of  <dig>  probes were used to detect mrna, of which the probes displaying hybridization signals represented approximately  <dig> – <dig> % of the total. probes lacking hybridization signals represented approximately  <dig> – <dig> % of the total, with  <dig> – <dig> % ambiguous hybridization signals. using the normal chickens as a control group, screening of the differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscles was carried out using significance analysis of microarrays  software. the screening criteria for signaling pathway analysis were that the q-value  was less than 5% and it showed a fold-change less than  <dig> .

the differential profiles in the skeletal muscle mrna of the 14-day-old embryos showed that there were  <dig> genes with a greater than 2-fold change in differential expression between the dwarf and normal chickens. of these,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. at 7 weeks,  <dig> genes had a greater than 2-fold change in differential expression between dwarf and normal chickens, with  <dig> mrnas up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated.

further comparisons between 14-day-old embryos and 7-week-old normal and dwarf chickens indicated consistent up-regulation in the mrna expression levels of five genes: arnt, bean, hscb, loc <dig>  and rcjmb04_1j <dig>  there were three genes, ghr, loc <dig>  and tmem <dig> that presented with consistent down-regulation in normal chickens but consistent up-regulation in dwarf chickens. the mrna expression of ghr in 14-day-old embryos of dwarf chickens was up-regulated  <dig> -fold compared with normal chickens, and was up-regulated  <dig> -fold in 7-week-old dwarf chickens as compared with normal chickens.

analysis of mirna target genes and differentially expressed mrna genes
among the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, there were some with the same seed sequence and target genes. this allowed for the classification of the mirnas into  <dig> categories. there were another five mirnas in which the target genes had not yet been discovered. the prediction results of the various types of differentially expressed mirna target genes are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

we compared various differentially expressed mirna prediction target genes with differentially expressed mrna of genes from 7-week-old chicken skeletal muscle. in total, corresponding differentially expressed genes were found for  <dig> types of mirnas . ghr was affected by let-7b, mir-15c, mir- <dig>  and mir-16c.

let-7b-mediated regulation of ghr expression
the mirnas involved in the regulation of ghr were let-7b, mir-15c , and mir-181b . blast analysis indicated that the last 29 bp of the ghr 3' utr exactly coincided with the target site of let-7b. this is consistent with the proposed mechanism of mirnas as mainly targeting the 3' utr of target genes. however, the target sites of mir-15c, mir- <dig>  mir-16c and mir-181b were far apart from the ghr region. expression levels of let-7b were significantly up-regulated in both dwarf and normal chickens at both stages of development investigated .

signaling pathway analysis of let-7b-regulated ghr
assuming that the dwarf chicken phenotype in this experiment was caused by a deletion mutation in ghr, we used the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  software  to conduct a pathway analysis for ghr. the results indicated that ghr is involved in the jak-stat signaling pathway .

the  <dig> genes involved in the jak-stat signaling pathway have been summarized in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  these genes were compared with the differentially expressed mrnas in 7-week-old skeletal muscles from dwarf and normal chickens. it was found that only one gene, socs <dig>  appeared in the mrna expression profiles. the kegg software was also used to analyze the signaling pathway of socs <dig> and was found to be involved in the adipocytokine signaling pathway .

from the adipocytokine signaling pathway, it can be seen that socs <dig> influences cellular regulation in three ways: inhibiting the irs <dig> gene through inhibition of the phosphorylation of tyrosine in insulin receptor substrate  <dig>  and thus inhibiting the insulin signalling pathway; inhibiting the lepr gene; and inhibiting the jak gene.

quantitative polymerase chain reaction  analysis of the ghr signaling pathway regulation by let-7b
based on the previously mentioned analyses, a schematic illustration of the ghr signaling pathway, as regulated by let-7b, was developed . to verify the signaling pathway, we carried out qpcr assays to determine mrna expression levels in the skeletal muscles of 7-week-old dwarf and normal chickens. the qpcr analysis showed that mrna expression of ghr and socs <dig> was up-regulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens. the mrna expression of these genes was up-regulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively, as shown by microarray analysis. expression of irs <dig>  lepr and jak <dig> was down-regulated  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively. the expression of myod <dig>  myog and myf <dig>  which regulate skeletal muscle growth, was down-regulated  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens. in addition, expression of igf <dig> and igf2bp <dig> in the insulin pathway is also down-regulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold respectively, in dwarf compared with normal chickens .

validation of the 3′ utr of ghr as the target site of let-7b
luciferase activity was decreased in df- <dig> cell lines transfected with pmirglo-let-7b-ghr 3′ utr , but increased in df- <dig> cells transfected with pmirglo-let-7b-ghr 3′ utr mutation, and in the control df- <dig> cell line . this confirms that the expression of ghr is regulated by let-7b, and that the let-7b target is located in the region of the ghr 3′ utr mutation.

in the overexpression assay for let-7b, we observed it was up-regulated  <dig> -fold as compared with the control. conversely, expression of ghr was down-regulated  <dig> -fold. additionally, expression of socs <dig>  stimulated by ghr, was down-regulated  <dig> -fold .

discussion
mirnas are a class of non-coding small rna molecules with a length of 18– <dig> nucleotides. they can direct the regulation of the expression levels of certain genes, control cell growth and development, and determine tissue type during cell differentiation by reducing the stability of target genes or inhibiting translation levels to influence cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. in animal cells, mirnas, by interacting with a specific sequence of target gene mrna, inhibit protein synthesis or induce mrna degradation and post-transcriptionally negatively regulate the expression of target genes  <cit> .

in this study, high-throughput microarray technology was used to analyze mirna and mrna expression profiles in the skeletal muscles of 14-day-old embryos and 7-week-old dwarf and normal chickens to identify mirnas related to skeletal muscle growth and development. in chickens,  <dig> pre-mirnas and  <dig> mature-mirnas have been reported  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were detected in the skeletal muscles of 14-day-old embryos from dwarf and normal chickens, respectively. we also detected  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas in the skeletal muscles of 7-week-old dwarf and normal chickens, respectively. such tissue-specific mirna expression has been reported in a few previous studies  <cit> . our data also showed that there is significantly different expression for only a few mirnas at the same developmental stages in dwarf and normal chickens. however, the expression profiles of a greater number of mirnas at different developmental stages for dwarf and normal chickens were significantly different. when comparing 7-week-old chickens with 14-day-old embryos, more down-regulated mirnas than up-regulated mirnas were detected. this would suggest that down-regulated expression of mirnas is favorable for muscle growth and development in chickens at 7 weeks. in 7-week-old chickens, as compared with 14-day-old embryos, the expression of let-7b, mir-30a-5p, mir-30b, mir-99a and mir-133b was significantly up-regulated, but mir-16c, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were significantly down-regulated in both dwarf and normal chickens. considering that gh and ghr play important roles in chicken growth and development, we focused on observing the mirnas involved in the regulation of their expression.

four mirnas, let-7b, mir- <dig>  mir-16c, and mir-181b, are involved in the regulation of ghr. blast analysis confirmed that the target location of let-7b was in the deleted region of ghr 3' utr. but the target locations of mir- <dig>  mir-16c and mir-181b were distant from the deleted region. we concluded that the regulation of let-7b could be critical to ghr expression. as the deletion mutation in dwarf chickens results in the loss of the ability of let-7b to pair with sequences in its target gene, the regulation of growth and development is affected.

skeletal muscle growth and development in chickens is fastest at the 7-week-old stage; conversely, the growth and development of skeletal muscle during the embryonic period is relatively slow. comparing dwarf with normal chickens, there was significantly different mrna expression for  <dig> genes in the 7-week-old chickens; however, there was significantly different mrna expression for only  <dig> genes in the 14-day-old embryos. for both 14-day-old embryos and 7-week-old chickens, mrna expression of ghr was up-regulated  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens. it is suggested that the mrna corresponding to ghr was inhibited in normal chickens as reported by wu et al. <cit> .

comparing the different developmental stages , expression levels of let-7b were significantly up-regulated in both dwarf and normal chickens. ghr expression was up-regulated in dwarf chickens and down-regulated in normal chickens, suggesting that let-7b could play a significant role in inhibiting ghr expression, further promoting the growth and development of skeletal muscle.

the let-7b mirna is a member of the let- <dig> family. deletion, or mutation of the function of let- <dig>  may lead to defects in the transformation of nematodes from their larval to adult stage  <cit> . methylation, post-translation modifications, and lin <dig> genes regulate the let- <dig> family. additionally, the family regulates rasmychmag2cdc25acdk <dig>  and other target genes that influence a variety of biological phenomena and physiological processes, especially during biological development, cell proliferation and differentiation, and tumor suppression. there are  <dig> homologs in the let- <dig> family in the human genome, clustered into eight sites  <cit> . these gene clusters are located at fragile sites related to lung cancer, breast cancer, urothelial cancer, and cervical cancer, suggesting that they may act as tumor suppressors. previous studies of the let- <dig> family have largely focused on tumor suppression mechanisms  <cit> , and studies investigating the family’s role in growth and development are rare.

the signaling pathway related to the regulation of the growth and development of skeletal muscle by let-7b-mediated ghr has not been previously reported. gh plays important roles in regulating animal growth and development, and its action on tissues and cells is mediated through its binding with ghr on the cell surface. ghr is activated upon binding of gh to stimulate the growth and metabolism of muscle, bone, and cartilage cells  <cit> . gh also regulates chicken growth through close binding to its receptor and activating expression of igf. the amount and action of ghr has direct effect on gh physiological function. in the present study, the mrna expression of ghr was significantly up-regulated in dwarf chickens compared with normal chickens. the up-regulated mrna expression of ghr retarded chicken growth, probably owing to a certain compensation mechanism  <cit> . our data showed that the retarded growth of dwarf chickens was caused by a deletion in the ghr 3′ utr inducing loss of the let-7b target site. through signaling pathway analysis, we found that let-7b regulates the expression of ghr, and further regulates socs <dig> through the jak-stat signaling pathway. studies have shown that socs <dig> can inhibit excessive cell growth and induce apoptosis as part of maintaining cell stability  <cit> . socs <dig> regulates the growth and development of chickens through three adipocytokine signaling pathways.  socs <dig> inhibits the tyrosine in irs <dig>  by inhibiting the phosphorylation of irs <dig>  socs <dig> inhibits insulin signaling, thus affecting growth.  socs <dig> inhibits lepr, and up-regulated socs <dig> expression in dwarf chickens may affect the function of leptin. leptin has a wide range of biological effects, with an important role in the metabolic regulation center of the hypothalamus, which plays a role in suppressing appetite, reducing energy intake, increasing energy expenditure and inhibiting fat synthesis. this helps explain why dwarf chickens are more likely to be obese  <cit> .  socs <dig> inhibits jak; the jak-stat signaling pathway is a recently discovered signal transduction pathway stimulated by cytokines, and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, immune regulation, and many other important biological processes.

in the present study, little change in expression of let-7b between dwarf and normal chickens was observed; however, growth was retarded in dwarf chickens. in dwarf chickens, let-7b could not inhibit the expression of ghr. this allows for the gene to be up-regulated as let-7b is unable to pair with ghr gene as its target site is deleted. data from the microarray and qpcr analyses supported that the above pathway, indicating that the expression of ghr is inhibited by let-7b, and the expression of socs <dig> gene is regulated and stimulated by ghr. further qpcr data supported that socs <dig> could inhibit the expression of irs <dig>  lepr and jak. the expression of irs <dig>  lepr and jak was significantly down-regulated, expression of genes regulating skeletal muscle growth  and the insulin pathway  were also down-regulated significantly.

CONCLUSIONS
a comparison of dwarf chickens with normal chickens at the same developmental stages revealed that expression profiles of only a few mirnas were significantly different. in 14-day-old embryos, the expression profiles of a greater number of mirnas were significantly different compared with those in 7-week-old chickens. by combining target gene prediction for differential mirnas, joint analysis of mrna expression profiles, and blast analysis, the critical role of let-7b in regulating the ghr expression was identified. with the aid of kegg signaling pathway and qpcr analyses, the network through which let-7b-mediated ghr regulates growth and development of skeletal muscle as well as fat deposition was established. it was confirmed that socs <dig> plays a critical role in inhibiting irs <dig>  lepr, and jak.
