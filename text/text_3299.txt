BACKGROUND

francisella tularensis, the aetiological agent of tularemia is a gram-negative, zoonotic bacterium with a broad host spectrum showing preference for infecting lagomorphs and rodents. f. tularensis ssp. tularensis is endemic in north america and it has two subpopulations , which differ in their geographic distribution, host and vector preference, virulence and genetic characteristics  <cit> . f. tularensis ssp. holarctica is moderately virulent; it is endemic all over the northern hemisphere, but despite its wide distribution, isolates within this subspecies show little genetic diversity  <cit> . high resolution molecular techniques  detection) differentiated two main genetic groups of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica in europe  with distinct geographic distribution  <cit> . the b.ftnf002- <dig> group proved to be dominant in western european countries , and the b. <dig> group was isolated mainly in northern, central and eastern europe  and the european part of russia, while both genotypes were detected in germany and switzerland . whole genome analysis of b.ftnf002- <dig> and b. <dig> genotypes revealed distinct genetic differences  which may be the result of a selection process acting on b.ftnf002- <dig> potentially leading to enhanced virulence and replication potential of this genotype  <cit> . differences can be detected in pathological signs of tularemia in european brown hares  in distinct geographical regions in europe. in hungary , necropsy findings in hares generally include granulomatous lesions in the lung, pericardium and kidneys due to a sub-acute or chronic infection  <cit> , while signs of an acute clinical course  have been described in hares that succumbed to tularemia in france and in the netherlands  <cit> . results of a recent publication confirmed that lesions observed in brown hares infected by f. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype b. <dig> differ from those associated with the genotype b.ftnf002- <dig> in switzerland where both genotypes are present in nature  <cit> .

the use of fischer  <dig> rats was preferred in previous experimental francisella infections when feasibility of vaccination or the host’s early innate immune response were examined. fischer  <dig> rats reflected best the human susceptibility to tularemia and showed higher resistance to the pathogen compared to other laboratory animals  . difference in susceptibility of fischer  <dig> rats to f. tularensis ssp. tularensis wild and reference  strains, and f. tularensis ssp. holarctica wild  and live vaccine  strains was also described earlier  <cit> . as intra-peritoneal challenge was shown to be the most successful route in experimental infections with francisella spp., it is considered to be an appropriate way to highlight differences in the hosts’ susceptibility to tularemia or in the virulence of bacterial strains  <cit> .

in this study the virulence of b.ftnf002- <dig> and b. <dig> f. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotypes was compared in fischer  <dig> rats performing experimental infection by the intra-peritoneal route.

methods
bacterial strains
genotype b.ftnf002- <dig> f. tularensis ssp. holarctica strain was originally isolated in  <dig> from a european brown hare in italy . genotype b. <dig> was isolated in  <dig> from a european brown hare in hungary . strain pv/21851/ <dig> was subcultured three times before the experiments, while strain fth24/ <dig> was gained after a mouse passage and three subcultures. bacterial strains were cultured on modified francis agar  for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c and 5% co <dig>  colonies from these cultures were first suspended in sterile saline and adjusted to  <dig>  mcfarland turbidity. subsequently  <dig> μl of each dilution from a tenfold dilution series of the previous suspension was inoculated on modified francis agar and incubated for  <dig> h to determine the number of colony forming units . for the infection of the fischer  <dig> rats, fresh bacterial colonies were suspended in sterile saline and adjusted to  <dig>  mcfarland turbidity, and then diluted in sterile saline to obtain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cfu suspensions. following the experimental infection of the rats, cfus were checked from the used dilutions on modified francis plates after  <dig> h of incubation.

experimental infection
age matched  female fischer  <dig> rats  were used in the study. the animals were kept in accordance with all national and institutional regulations. the animal experiment was performed according to the guidelines approved by the national ethical committee  and the ethical committee of the institute for veterinary medical research. the rats  were injected via the intra-peritoneal route with  <dig> μl inocula containing either  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cfus of the b.ftnf002- <dig> or b. <dig> genotypes of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica. a group of  <dig> fischer  <dig> rats injected intra-peritoneally with  <dig> μl sterile saline was used as a negative control in the experiment. after infection, the animals were checked and measured at  <dig> h intervals by the same person for  <dig> days. clinical signs were registered throughout the experiment and they were used to establish three categories  of disease severity to be used in the analyses . rats that did not succumb to the infection were euthanized by co <dig> overexposure at the end of the experiment. slide agglutination test was performed at necropsy with heart blood, using the commercially available f. tularensis antigen . after a gross pathological examination, tissue samples were collected from the lungs, thymus, liver, spleen, kidneys, small and large intestine, muscle, bone marrow and brain , fixed in 8% neutral buffered formalin and submitted for histological and immunohistochemical examinations.table  <dig> categories of clinical signs shown by francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica infected fischer  <dig> rats




histology and immunohistochemistry
pathological changes were studied by light microscopy on four-micrometer thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples stained with haematoxylin and eosin. immunohistochemical examinations were performed as described before  <cit> . in brief, sections were de-paraffinized and incubated in 3% h2o <dig> solution for  <dig> min and in 2% solution of skimmed milk powder for  <dig> min. the sections were incubated overnight at  <dig> °c with anti-f. tularensis hyperimmune rabbit serum diluted 1: <dig>  in phosphate-buffered saline . antibody binding was detected using anti-rabbit antibodies with horse-radish peroxidase -labelled polymer following manufacturer’s instructions . non-infected rat tissue samples served as a negative control. for some sections antiserum was replaced by pbs to rule out the possibility of any nonspecific binding. lesions and immunoreactivity were evaluated by a single pathologist in a treatment-blinded manner. the amount of antigen in the lung, liver and spleen was graded based on the number of affected organs and antigen observations/field of vision at 100x magnification .

statistical analysis
the results of the experimental infection experiments were compared with independent t-test, mann-whitney u test and kruskal-wallis test in statistica software . the virulence of the b.ftnf002- <dig> and b. <dig> groups was compared based on the statistical analyses of the total weight loss and severity of clinical signs . total weight loss represents the percent change in body weight on the day when the smallest weight was measured  relative to the weight of the day of infection  for each animal . clinical sign scores recorded between days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection were compared between groups infected with the two genotypes using mann-whitney u test .

RESULTS
all rats showed clinical signs between days 3– <dig> post infection after intra-peritoneal inoculation with suspensions containing either  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cfus of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains . clinical signs included porphyrin accumulation around the eyes, nasal discharge, weight loss, weakness, ruffled fur, inactivity, diarrhoea and laboured breathing . general linear model analysis showed the effect of the challenge dose on the course of the disease , however, association between the severity of the clinical signs and the challenge dose was not detected. more than 50% of the rats survived the intra-peritoneal challenge by f. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains in all but one group , thus further analysis was based on the comparison of the two main groups differing in the genotype of the infectious agent. total weight loss was significantly higher  in the group infected with the b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype. changes in body weight  between days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection are shown in fig.  <dig>  and the percentages of the total weight loss are listed in table  <dig>  comparison of the severity of clinical signs  revealed significant differences  between the two groups. median values of the clinical scores and changes in weight loss between days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection are demonstrated in fig.  <dig>  the median values of the clinical scores between days 1– <dig> post infection showed, that rats infected with the b. <dig> genotype recovered from the disease two days earlier than rats infected with genotype b.ftnf002- <dig>  in the b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype infected groups  <dig> %  of the animals succumbed to tularemia between days 4– <dig> post infection. in contrast, only  <dig> %  of the rats died of the disease caused by the b. <dig> genotype on days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection. post mortem examinations did not reveal differences in the pathological changes associated with the two bacterial strains. at necropsy, the deceased rats were seronegative while all surviving rats showed seroconversion in slide agglutination test on day  <dig> post infection . macroscopic pathological findings were scarce, an enlarged spleen being occasionally observed in both deceased and euthanized rats. histological findings in rats that succumbed to the infection consisted of acute multiple necrotic foci in the liver and spleen and immunohistochemistry showed large amounts of antigen in these organs . sub-acute interstitial lympho-histiocytic inflammation was also observed in the lung with high or moderate amounts of antigen in rats that died of the infection. seropositive rats which were sacrificed on day  <dig> post infection showed distended sinusoids and activation of kupffer cells associated with multifocal interstitial infiltration by mixed inflammatory cells in the liver and a moderate follicular hyperplasia and hyperaemia in the spleen with no or low amounts of antigen .fig.  <dig> comparison of changes in body weight in francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica infected fischer  <dig> rats. fischer  <dig> rats were infected with three concentrations of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype b. <dig>  or b.ftnf002- <dig> . challenge doses are given under each diagram in colony forming units. values are representing the percent change in body weight between days  <dig> and  <dig> post infection relative to the initial weight on the day of infection for each animal. positive values representing weight gain, while negative values are showing weight loss. asterisks are representing the death of the animals

discussion
while clear differences are described in the virulence of the f. tularensis ssp. tularensis subpopulations, little or no information is available about the virulence of the subpopulations of the widespread holarctica subspecies  <cit> . interactions among hosts with different susceptibility to tularemia and strains of the two genetic groups of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica  were previously compared in vitro, but no difference was detected in the ability of genotypes to evade the hosts’ complement system  <cit> .

the susceptibility of fischer  <dig> rats to tularemia was described in previous examinations  <cit> . experimental infection of fischer  <dig> rats with intra-peritoneal inoculation of  <dig> cfu of a f. tularensis ssp. holarctica strain from sweden  induced fatal disease within  <dig> days  <cit> .

the results of the current study revealed moderate difference in the pathogenic potential of the two strains belonging to the two genetic groups of f. tularensis ssp. holarctica and support the hypothesis that b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype is more virulent than the b. <dig> genotype. low mortality rates were observed in the infected animals, which might be an effect of a possible attenuation process during the culture of bacteria on artificial media and implies the potential need for the use of higher bacterial loads in experimental infections. however, clinical signs manifested in all rats, and they were in accordance with previously described symptoms in fischer  <dig> rats infected subcutaneously with f. tularensis ssp. tularensis schu s <dig> strain  <cit> . interestingly, the challenge dose did not affect the severity of clinical signs, the time and number of deaths, nor the extent of weight loss, similarly to the observations in previous studies on non-human primates and fischer  <dig> rats  <cit> . analysis of weight loss was used for the determination of susceptibility of fischer  <dig> rats to tularemia before  <cit> . in the current experiment rats infected with b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype showed significantly higher total weight loss and more prolonged course of the disease compared to rats infected with b. <dig> genotype , suggesting a more severe progression of the illness during infection with the b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype. the assumed higher virulence of b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype is consistent with previous observations on the clinical features and pathology of tularemic brown hares associated with the two genotypes. nevertheless, experimental infection of the brown hare, the host presenting different types of pathological changes, with a higher number of strains belonging to these two genotypes should confirm field observations and enable deeper insight into the assumed difference in virulence between genotypes. examining the f. tularensis ssp. holarctica susceptibility of european brown hares originating from distinct geographical areas may also provide important additional information about the ecology of this pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
the moderate differences in the pathogenic potential of b. <dig> and b.ftnf002- <dig> genotype f. tularensis ssp. holarctica strains, as observed during the experimental infection of fischer  <dig> rats support a higher virulence of b.ftnf002- <dig>  which is the dominant genotype in western european countries. the results are in accordance with previous observations on the pathology of tularemic brown hares infected by the two genotypes.
