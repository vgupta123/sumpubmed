BACKGROUND
the bacterial genus salmonella contains more than  <dig> very closely related serovars, classified by the kauffmann-white scheme according to their differences in the somatic  and flagellar  antigens  <cit> . although essentially all salmonella bacteria are pathogens, they may have different host ranges or cause different diseases.

over  <dig> salmonella serovars may infect humans, with most of them causing self-limiting gastroenteritis. on the other hand, a few salmonella serovars, such as salmonella typhi, s. paratyphi a, s. paratyphi b and s. paratyphi c, are adapted to humans and cause typhoid fever, a serious and potentially fatal systemic infection  <cit> . it is not clear whether these salmonella typhoid agents use the same, similar or totally different pathogenic traits to infect the same host and cause the disease. genomic comparisons between s. typhi and s. paratyphi a did not reveal a common genetic basis possibly responsible for human adaptation or typhoid pathogenesis  <cit> . notably, various salmonella pathogenicity islands  or prophages have been identified in the salmonella typhoid agents, e.g., spi- <dig> in s. typhi  <cit>  and s. paratyphi c  <cit> , and spa- <dig>  spa- <dig> and spa- <dig> in s. paratyphi a  <cit> , but their specific roles in typhoid pathogenesis have not been well established.

in a previous study, we located several insertions in the genome of s. paratyphi c strain rks <dig> by comparing it with other salmonella genomes  <cit> , including one, spc-p <dig>  which was a prophage present only in s. paratyphi c among all sequenced salmonella strains  <cit> . in this study, we characterized this novel prophage, predicted its possible roles in the pathogenicity of s. paratyphi c, and evaluated its potential contributions to pathogenicity in animal experiments. we found that, although no previously known pathogenicity-associated genes were identified in the prophage, spc-p <dig> did increase the pathogenicity of the bacteria.

RESULTS
genomic location and identification of prophage spc-p1
we screened the complete nucleotide sequence of the s. paratyphi c rks <dig> genome  by phage_finder http://phage-finder.sourceforge.net for possible prophage sequences and located five regions with typical prophage characteristics, with four of them having been reported in other salmonella serovars and well studied previously, including gifsy- <dig> and gifsy- <dig> in s. typhimurium lt <dig>  <cit>  and spa- <dig> and phage spa-3-p <dig> in s. paratyphi a atcc <dig>  <cit> . these prophages have also been known to be present in several other salmonella serovars, such as s. choleraesuis  <cit> . the remaining genomic region corresponds to the previously mapped  <dig> kb insertion between genes purc and purf  <cit>  and has typical features of a prophage; here we designate this region spc-p <dig>  sequence analysis showed that spc-p <dig> lies between two adjacent genes, pgte and yfdc, in s. paratyphi c rks <dig>  whereas in fifteen other published salmonella genomes , we did not find dna insertions in this region. the ends of spc-p <dig> were set by two direct repeats of the sequence tggtgtcccctgcag, a typical feature for the ends of prophage dna sequences. one of the repeat sequences begins at  <dig> bp upstream of spc-p <dig> orf <dig>  and the other begins at  <dig> bp downstream of orf <dig> and continues with an arg trna gene. the total length of spc-p <dig> is  <dig>  bp and the overall g+c content is  <dig> %, which is similar to those of phage p <dig>   <cit>  and st64t   <cit>  and is significantly lower than the  <dig> % average of the s. paratyphi c rks <dig> chromosome.

layout and predicted products of spc-p <dig> genes
using vector nti  <dig>  and glimmer <dig>  we identified  <dig> orfs in spc-p <dig>  designated consecutively from orf <dig> through orf <dig> , with the orf encoding the terminase small unit as orf <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  the g+c contents of individual orfs vary from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % , demonstrating an obvious mosaic structure.

of the  <dig> orfs,  <dig> had atg and six  had gtg as the start codon. functions of the spc-p1genes were inferred based on similarities with characterized genes from other phages; some salient features of these protein-encoding genes are summarized in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> 

three of the predicted spc-p <dig> protein-encoding genes  have no phage-borne homologues in the current databases. however, it is worthwhile to note that the deduced product of orf <dig> shows a low but significant level of similarity with the acyltransferase  <dig> of pseudomonas syringae py. syringae b728a . on the other hand, several bacteriophages such as shigella flexneri bacteriophage sf <dig> have o-antigen acetyltransferase gene in their genomes. as the protein products of such genes may alter the bacterial o-antigens  <cit> , they likely would make important contributions to the bacterial virulence. the remaining  <dig> orfs all have close homologues with previously characterized phages of enteric bacteria. the orfs can be divided into nine main clusters according to the predicted functions, which are arranged in the following order: head, tail, integration, ea region, recombination, immunity, replication, nin region and lysis . the gene cluster encoding the phage head covers a large region and consists of twelve orfs. this region is closely related to the morphogenetic regions of previously characterized phages such as cus- <dig>  hk <dig>  sf <dig>  p <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  however none of the latter six phages has the whole set of twelve orfs seen in spc-p <dig> . the arrangement of the orfs in this part of spc-p <dig> is similar to that of cus- <dig>  sf <dig> or hk <dig> in the gene order of 5'-small terminase-large terminase-portal-decoration-coat-3'. this suggests that orf1-orf <dig> define a type of head gene module, which is highly conservative in these phages . the gene cluster encoding phage tail is composed of only one orf, orf <dig>  the deduced product of which shows certain similarities to those of some known phages, such as p <dig>  st <dig>  st64t, hk <dig>  cus- <dig> and sf <dig>  additionally, spc-p <dig> also contains gene clusters for phage integration , recombination , immunity , replication  and lysis , suggesting that spc-p <dig> encodes all functions required by and sufficient for an active phage.

phylogenetic analysis of spc-p1
both nucleotide and deduced protein sequence homologies indicate that spc-p <dig> is a member of the lambdoid phage group and the predicted functions of the genes are similar to those of lambdoid phages, especially to cus- <dig>  hk <dig>  sf <dig>  st64t, p <dig> and st <dig>  each of these phages has about half of their deduced protein products showing high similarity with those of spc-p <dig>  providing evidence of mosaic architecture and extensive recombination events creating spc-p <dig> during evolution. we chose twelve phages for comparisons with spc-p <dig> using mauve  <dig> . <dig>  which can produce a phylogenetic tree of mosaic phage and prophage genomes. the phylogenetic tree thus obtained revealed that spc-p <dig> is closest to cus- <dig> .

distribution of spc-p <dig> in other salmonella serovars and among s. paratyphi c strains
to determine whether spc-p <dig> is present in other salmonella serovars, we searched the genbank nucleotide collection  database and found that only some segments of spc-p <dig> could be found in s. choleraesuis sc-b <dig> and s. paratyphi a atcc <dig>  we then searched other wild type strains of s. paratyphi c for spc-p <dig>  using primers amplifying six segments of spc-p <dig> with overlapping regions , we amplified regions of  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> to  <dig> bp and  <dig> to  <dig> bp, respectively , and demonstrated that the whole sequence of spc-p <dig> is also present in eight of the fourteen wild type strains tested .

"+"means the strain is positive for spc-p <dig> and "-" means the strain is negative for spc-p1

induction of spc-p <dig> and morphological analysis
since spc-p <dig> seems to contain all necessary genes for a viable phage, we wondered whether it could be induced from the bacterial genome. upon mitomycin c treatment, the culture of s. paratyphi c rks <dig> became clearer than the culture without mitomycin treatment, suggesting that phage were induced to lyse the cells.

for propagation and characterization of the induced phage, we attempted finding a strain of s. paratyphi c that is sensitive to the phage. we used the lysate of rks <dig> after mitomycin c treatment to infect the seven s. paratyphi c strains, whose pcr results were negative for spc-p <dig>  and inspected plaque formation on them. we found plaques on strain cn13/ <dig>  to confirm that the plaques were formed by spc-p <dig>  we carried out pcr identification on the plaques; all six segments of spc-p <dig> were amplified by pcr with the six pairs of primers .

based on its genomic organization, we predicted that spc-p <dig> phage would resemble cus- <dig> with a characteristic short tail. to validate its morphology, we single-plaque isolated spc-p <dig> and propagated the phage on cn13/ <dig> for transmission electron microscopy. we saw typical short-tailed phage particles .

lysogenic conversion of cn13/ <dig> by spc-p1
since spc-p <dig> could be induced from the genome of s. paratyphi c rks <dig> and strain cn13/ <dig> is sensitive to spc-p <dig>  we wondered whether spc-p <dig> could lysogenize cn13/ <dig>  spc-p <dig> and cn13/ <dig> were mixed at a multiplicity of infection of 1: <dig> and then co-cultured on lb plates. single colonies were isolated and infected with spc-p <dig> again. three of the eight colonies, no.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the plate shown in figure  <dig>  were resistant to spc-p <dig>  suggesting lysogenization by, and immunity to, spc-p <dig>  we amplified all six segments of spc-p <dig> from them, demonstrating lysogenization of the bacteria by spc-p1; representative results are shown in figure  <dig> 

increased pathogenicity of lysogenized cn13/ <dig> in mouse infection experiments
since orf <dig> shows certain sequence similarity with the acyltransferase  <dig> of pseudomonas syringae py. syringae b728a and the o-antigen genes play important roles in bacterial virulence, we wondered whether spc-p <dig> might be involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria. we orally infected mice with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> viable bacterial cells  of wild type or lysogenized cn13/ <dig>  we did not include the s. paratyphi c strain rks <dig>  from which spc-p <dig> was originally isolated, because we did not have a spc-p1-free rks <dig> so comparison of virulence between spc-p1-plus and spc-p1-minus rks <dig> lines was not possible. on day  <dig> after infection, we sacrificed the mice and cultured homogenized liver, lung and spleen tissues to detect bacteria and determine the numbers of bacterial cells that will be required to establish infection in half of the inoculated mice . the wild type and lysogenized cn13/ <dig> strains demonstrated greatly different pathogenicity on the animals, with id <dig> values of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfus and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfus, respectively . all recovered bacteria were confirmed to be identical to those in the inocula by serological and phage tests and pulsed field gel electrophoresis . pathological examinations showed multiple organ damages in mice infected with  <dig> cells of lysogenized cn13/ <dig> .

a infection means appearance of bacteria in any of the examined organ tissues of the animal.

discussion
bacteria evolve by accumulating mutations and incorporating laterally transferred genes, among which phages are by far the most important driving force. for example, since the divergence from e. coli about 120- <dig> million years ago  <cit> , salmonella have developed into a great number of distinct lineages, with more than  <dig> serovars currently recognized  <cit> . they all share a core genome, which is about 90% of the genes for salmonella subgroup i serovars, with the remaining ca. 10% genes being specific to individual serovars  <cit> . genomic analyses reveal that salmonella harbor numerous temperate bacteriophages  <cit> . in fact, most of the non-core genome sequences are derived from phages, which play key roles in bacterial genome evolution and pathogenicity. in this study, we characterized a novel prophage, spc-p <dig>  in the genome of s. paratyphi c rks <dig> and demonstrated that this phage is present only in s. paratyphi c strains but not in any other salmonella serovars tested. spc-p <dig> exhibits typical characteristics of prophages, including a significantly lower overall g+ c content than that of the bacterial genome average, repeat sequences at the ends of its genome, and trna genes at the integration site. sequence analysis showed that spc-p <dig> has a substantial portion of its genome being highly related to previously characterized lambdoid phages and it has a complete set of genes to encode a viable phage. the mitomycin c induction test confirmed this.

although prophages are widely found in bacterial genomes, most of them are defective, unable to produce viable phage particles. sequence analysis indicated close relatedness of spc-p <dig> to cus- <dig> and electron microscopy also revealed morphological similarity between spc-p <dig> and cus- <dig>  like cus- <dig>  spc-p <dig> also has a cosahedral head and a short tail. since spc-p <dig> could be induced from the bacterial genome and we had available the spc-p <dig> sensitive strain cn13/ <dig>  we had the opportunity to propagate this phage for further studies. spc-p <dig> could not only lyse cn13/ <dig> but also lysogenize it, which allows us to study the possible roles of spc-p <dig> in bacterial pathogenicity.

s. paratyphi c is one of the few salmonella serovars that cause typhoid fever in humans, along with s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b, but it is not fully clear whether different salmonella typhoid agents cause the disease by similar or distinct mechanisms. prophages can contribute important biological properties to their bacterial hosts and analysis of the prophages may shed light on the evolution of their hosts. considering that the human-adapted typhoid agents may have evolved by convergent processes  <cit> , we speculate that s. paratyphi c may cause the disease by different mechanisms than those used by other salmonella typhoid agents. as spc-p <dig> is found only in s. paratyphi c, it may be involved in the pathogenesis of typhoid caused by s. paratyphi c. taking the advantage that s. paratyphi c, unlike other human-adapted salmonella typhoid agents, can infect hosts other than humans if large inocula are used  <cit> , we compared pathogenicity of s. paratyphi c between spc-p1-free and spc-p1-lysogenized isogenic strains. we found that spc-p <dig> significantly increased the pathogenicity of s. paratyphi c and caused multiple organ damages in the animals , but the molecular basis is yet to be understood.

CONCLUSIONS
spc-p <dig> contributes pathogenicity to s. paratyphi c in animal infection models, so it is possible that this prophage is involved in typhoid pathogenesis in humans. genetic and functional analyses of spc-p <dig> may facilitate the study of evolution of the different typhoid agents, providing particular help in elucidating the pathogenic determinants of the typhoid agents.
