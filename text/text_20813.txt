BACKGROUND
the vitamin d receptor  and pregnane x receptor  are members of the nuclear hormone receptor  superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. nrs work in concert with co-activators and co-repressors to regulate gene expression  <cit> . nrs share a modular domain structure, which includes, from n-terminus to c-terminus, a modulatory a/b domain, the dna-binding domain , the hinge d domain, the ligand-binding domain  and a variable c-terminal f domain  <cit> .

vdrs bind 1α,25-2-vitamin d <dig>  with high affinity and mediate classic calcitriol effects such as regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis . over the last two decades, vdrs have been shown to influence a variety of physiological functions, affecting nearly every organ and tissue  <cit> . vdr genes have been detected in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, teleost fish, and sea lamprey   <cit> . all mammalian genomes analyzed to date have a single vdr gene; where expression has been studied, vdr is expressed in a broad range of tissues that include brain, gut, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, pancreas, and immune tissues  <cit> . a similarly broad pattern of tissue expression is also seen with african clawed frog   <cit>  and avian vdrs  <cit> . some teleost fish, including pufferfish  and japanese flounder  have two vdr genes  <cit> . like mammalian, bird, and frog vdrs, the pufferfish vdrα and flounder vdrβ have widespread tissue distribution; in contrast, the pufferfish vdrβ is expressed only in gut while the flounder vdrα shows little or no expression in liver, gill, and skeletal muscle  <cit> .

in contrast to vdrs, pxrs have broad ligand specificity and, at least in mammals and chicken, serve as a 'chemical defense' protein that senses toxic concentrations of a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds and transcriptionally controls detoxification pathways in liver, intestine, and other organs  <cit> . pxr regulates the metabolism, transport, and excretion of bile salts, xenobiotics, steroid hormones, and vitamins. 'classic' pxr transcriptional targets in mammals include the broad specificity cytochrome p <dig>  2c and 3a enzymes, as well as transporters such as multidrug resistant protein   <cit> . while the majority of pxr studies have been on mammalian species, studies of chicken pxr  show similar transcriptional targets  <cit> .

pxr genes have been cloned and functionally characterized from a variety of vertebrate species, including human, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, pig, chicken, african clawed frog, and zebrafish  <cit> . the pxr lbd is unusually divergent across species compared to other nrs , and previous studies have shown significant differences in ligand specificity of pxrs across species  <cit> . unlike vdr, pxr gene have yet to be detected in cartilaginous fish.

in this study, we characterize in detail the ligand specificity of vdrs from three model non-mammalian species: sea lamprey , zebrafish , and the african clawed frog . in addition, we study the single vdr/pxr-like nr from the chordate invertebrate ciona intestinalis   <cit> , a member of urochordata, a subphylum now thought to be the closest extant relatives of vertebrates  <cit> . we compare these vdrs to human and mouse vdrs . we also probed the evolutionary origin of pxr and vdr in basal vertebrates. to this end, we searched for evidence of pxr-like gene in sea lamprey both by comparative genomics and by functional assays in cultured primary hepatocytes. primary hepatocyte culture systems were also developed and tested for zebrafish and african clawed frog. the zebrafish studies were carried further by studies of liver transcription following injection of zebrafish with bile salts. the results demonstrate that classic pxr effects, similar to those described in mammals and chicken, are evident in zebrafish liver and isolated hepatocytes. in contrast, there is no genomic or functional evidence of a pxr-like gene in sea lamprey.

RESULTS
ligand specificity of vertebrate vdrs
to compare ligand specificity of mammalian and non-mammalian vdrs, luciferase-based reporter assays were used to study ligand activation of hvdr, mvdr, xlvdr, zfvdr, lampvdr, and ciona vdr/pxr . all five vertebrate receptors were activated by 1α,25-2-vitamin d <dig> , 1α-hydroxyvitamin d <dig>  1α-hydroxyvitamin d <dig>  25-hydroxyvitamin d <dig>  and  <dig> -2-vitamin d <dig> . xlvdr has lower potency for the five vitamin d derivatives studied, similar to the initial report published on x. laevis vdr  <cit> . the other notable difference was that the two mammalian vdrs had higher apparent affinity for 1α-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> and 1α-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> than the three non-mammalian vdrs . otherwise, there were few major differences between the five receptors with regard to vitamin d derivatives. this is consistent with the high degree of sequence conservation across vertebrate vdrs at positions shown to interact with ligands in x-ray crystallographic structures of human  <cit> , rat  <cit> , and zebrafish vdrs  <cit>  . the civdr/pxr was not activated by any of the vitamin d derivatives .

a 76-compound library of known nuclear hormone receptor ligands was screened for additional activators of xlvdr, zfvdr, and lampvdr . none of these three vdrs were activated by farnesoid x receptor  or liver x receptor α  or β  ligands such as t- <dig>  fexaramine, gw <dig>  or gw <dig>  or by steroid hormones such as 17β-estradiol or testosterone . an unexpected finding was that 6-formylindolo- -carbazole, a tryptophan photoproduct that is a high affinity agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor  <cit> , weakly activated the vdrs in the low micromolar range . this planar compound more strongly activated the civdr/pxr . the dioxin compound  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  also activated the civdr/pxr but not the vertebrate vdrs . like 6-formylindolo- -carbazole, tcdd is also a planar compound .

studies of zebrafish primary hepatocytes
we next focused on studies of pxr in non-mammalian species. a major transcriptional target of pxr and vdr in mammals and birds is cytochrome p <dig>  3a, a subfamily of enzymes with broad ligand specificity. a common functional assay for cyp3a activity is steroid  6β-hydroxylation – this activity is often used to measure cyp3a induction by xenobiotics or other compounds  <cit> . exposure to pxr agonists increases testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in primary human and rodent hepatocytes  <cit> , as well as in the chicken liver lmh cell line  <cit> . vdr agonists upregulate cyp3a more prominently in the intestine than liver in humans  <cit> .

other than studies in the chicken lmh cell line mentioned above, little is known about enzyme induction in other non-mammalian species  <cit> . to this end, we developed a zebrafish primary hepatocyte cell culture model, adapting a protocol previously published by collodi and colleagues  <cit> . as an initial test of enzyme induction, we first analyzed the ability of compounds to induce ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase  activity as a measure of cyp1a-like activity typical of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway  <cit> . similar to results previously reported for the zebrafish zfl liver cell line  <cit> ,  <dig> hour exposure of the zebrafish cells to the dioxin compound tcdd strongly increased erod activity . 3-methylcholanthrene  also induced erod activity with similar efficacy but lower potency than tcdd . in contrast,  <dig> '-diindoylmethane  at concentrations of  <dig> μm and greater caused a decrease in erod activity . a variety of other compounds were tested and found not to affect erod activity in the zebrafish hepatocytes; these included calcitriol, 5α-androstan-3α-ol , 5α-cyprinol  27-sulfate , nifedipine, and phenobarbital .

next, the ability of compounds to increase testosterone hydroxylation was tested in the zebrafish hepatocytes. vehicle-treated zebrafish hepatocytes demonstrated basal 6β-, 15α-, 16α-, and 16β-hydroxylation activity as demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography  analysis . in response to either androstanol or phenobarbital, 6β-hydroxylation was increased significantly . these two compounds have been previously described as zebrafish pxr agonists  <cit> . in contrast to 6β-hydroxylation, 15α-, 16α-, and 16β-hydroxylation activities were not influenced by incubation with androstanol, phenobarbital, or any other drugs tested . varying the exposure time of the inducers revealed that optimal induction was achieved with 48-hour exposure. incubation with calcitriol  did not increase 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone. nifedipine  and 5α-cyprinol 27-sulfate  both produced small but reproducible increases in 6β-hydroxylation activity compared to vehicle-treated levels . somewhat unexpectedly, tcdd was found to be a potent and efficacious inducer of testosterone 6β-hydroxylation .

the ability of androstanol, 5α-cyprinol 27-sulfate, and phenobarbital to increase 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone in the zebrafish hepatocytes occurred at similar concentrations to those that activated recombinant zebrafish pxr, as measured by a luciferase-based assay in hepg <dig> cells . the efficacy of these three compounds for increasing testosterone 6β-hydroxylation were, however, different; for example, phenobarbital has lower efficacy than androstanol for activating recombinant zebrafish pxr  but higher efficacy in increasing testosterone 6β-hydroxylase activity in primary zebrafish hepatocytes . these discrepancies may result in part from metabolism of steroid hormones and/or bile salts by the hepatocytes as opposed to hepg <dig> cells. tcdd was also found to activate zebrafish pxr  but at much higher concentrations than needed to induce testosterone 6β-hydroxylation . in fact, the concentrations of tcdd that increased testosterone 6β-hydroxylation are very close to those that increased erod activity in the zebrafish hepatocytes , suggesting that a common mechanism  mediates both effects.

a limited number of compounds were also tested for the ability to hydroxylate flurbiprofen, a measure of cyp2c <dig> activity in humans  <cit> . zebrafish hepatocytes had basal flurbiprofen 4-hydroxylation activities of approximately  <dig> nmol/min/mg protein. this activity was markedly higher in hepatocytes exposed to phenobarbital , with maximal activities greater than  <dig> nmol/min/mg protein in phenobarbital-treated cells . lesser increases relative to vehicle control were seen with treatments by tcdd  or androstanol .

effects of bile salts on in vivo transcription in zebrafish livers
to further probe the effects of endogenous pxr activators on zebrafish liver in vivo, zebrafish were separately injected with each of four bile salts or vehicle controls. these included 5α-cyprinol 27-sulfate , 5β-scymnol  27-sulfate , as well as unconjugated 5α-cyprinol and 5β-scymnol . zebrafish were then sacrificed and liver mrna isolated. as measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription -pcr, none of the four bile salts produced any significant effect on transcription of β-actin  or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase . relative to vehicle control, 5α-cyprinol 27-sulfate, but not the other three bile salts, produced a significant increase in transcription of mdr <dig>  as measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription rt-pcr . the bile salts tested did not produce significant effects on transcription of pxr  or cyp3c <dig> . these results are limited by possible metabolism of the bile salts following injection in zebrafish but do confirm that the major bile salt of zebrafish can produce classic pxr effects in zebrafish liver, including increased transcription of mdr, an effect that can be mediated by pxr in mammals  <cit> .

studies of african clawed frog primary hepatocytes
adapting a previously published protocol  <cit> , we also cultured primary hepatocytes from adult african clawed frogs . tcdd markedly increased erod activity following a  <dig> hour exposure although with lower potency and efficacy than in the zebrafish hepatocytes . these results are consistent with previous reports showing lower sensitivity of xenopus laevis aryl hydrocarbon receptors to tcdd  <cit> . the frog hepatocytes showed significant 6β- and 12α-hydroxylation of testosterone ; however, neither activity was substantially increased relative to vehicle control by treatment with dexamethasone, calcitriol, 5α-cyprinol, 5α-cyprinol 27-sulfate , tcdd, or the xenopus laevis pxrα endogenous agonist 3-aminoethylbenzoate  <cit>  . thus, unlike zebrafish, testosterone hydroxylation by frog hepatocytes is not induced by activators of frog pxrs  or aryl hydrocarbon receptors.

studies of sea lamprey primary hepatocytes
sea lampreys are a member of the jawless fish , a paraphyletic superclass of the phylogenetically most basal vertebrates. using an adaptation of previously published methods for culturing primary sea lamprey tissues  <cit> , we developed a primary cell culture method for sea lamprey hepatocytes. initial experiments utilizing larval stage lampreys  were unsuccessful due to frequent contamination with bacteria and fungi, despite trying multiple antibiotic combinations and different decontamination techniques. similar problems were also mentioned by ma and collodi  <cit> . culture of hepatocytes from transformer stage lampreys were more successful and yielded cells that grew for at least 7– <dig> days. we were unable to passage the cells.

in contrast to the zebrafish hepatocytes, the sea lamprey hepatocytes demonstrated undetectable erod activity , both at baseline and after 24– <dig> hr exposure to various compounds. the following compounds did not alter erod activity: tcdd, 5α-petromyzonol , 5α-petromyzonol 24-sulfate , androstanol, calcitriol, 3-mc, and phenobarbital. these results are consistent with that of a previous study that showed low basal erod activity in microsomes from sea lamprey livers and, additionally, no inducibility of erod activity in sea lampreys treated with compounds that act as efficacious aryl hydrocarybon receptor agonists in teleosts and terrestrial vertebrates  <cit> .

the sea lamprey hepatocytes showed significant testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity with an average basal activity of  <dig> pmol/min/mg protein. no other hydroxylated metabolites of testosterone were detected by hplc even after incubating the hepatocytes with  <dig> μm testosterone for up to  <dig> hours. a wide range of compounds were tested for the ability to induce testosterone hydroxylation in lamprey hepatocytes including androstanol , 5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol , calcitriol , dexamethasone , 5α-petromyzonol , 5α-petromyzonol 24-sulfate , 3-keto-5α-petromyzonol , 3-mc , phenobarbital , pregnenolone , pregnenolone sulfate , tcdd , and 25-hydroxyvitamin d <dig> . none of these compounds produced significant increases in testosterone 6β-hydroxylation. the lamprey hepatocytes also were able to 4-hydroxylate flurbiprofen . flurbiprofen 4-hydroxylation was significantly decreased by  <dig> hour treatment with 5α-petromyzonol  and 3-mc .

finally, we also looked for evidence of pxr gene in the preliminary assembly of the sea lamprey genome . we searched for potential pxr ortholog in sea lamprey by a reciprocal blast analysis strategy  <cit> . blast queries using dbd, lbd, and full-length protein sequences of all available vertebrate pxrs and cars  against translated nucleotides of the sea lamprey draft genome  did not reveal any gene fragments that, when blasted against the genbank nr database  <cit> , reciprocally returned pxr or car genes. these analyses did, however, detect the already described sea lamprey vdr  <cit>  and a novel, putative sea lamprey ortholog to farnesoid x receptor . several contigs corresponded to the published cdna sequence for the sea lamprey vdr genbank: ay <dig> <cit> : these included contig  <dig> , contig  <dig> , contig  <dig> , and contig  <dig> . the contigs that likely correspond to a lamprey fxr are contig  <dig> , contig  <dig> , and contig  <dig> . the lamprey fxr-like gene fragments showed closest sequence identity to the recently cloned and characterized fxr for the little skate   <cit> . similar to cars and pxrs, no putative orthologs to liver x receptors  were detected as well. in summary, although more complete sequencing of the sea lamprey genome may reveal additional nr1h and 1i genes, the evidence so far suggests the presence of fxr and vdr only, fewer than the inventory found in teleost fish , african clawed frog , chicken  or mammals .

discussion
vdr and pxr are closely related nrs in the nr1i subfamily that we previously proposed to have arisen from a duplication of an ancestral gene  <cit> . although at first glance these two nrs appear to be quite different, they bind to similar response elements in the promoter of target genes and also share a number of target genes including cyp3a enzymes  <cit> . some of the key evolutionary transitions in ligand selectivity for nr1i receptors are indicated in the phylogeny shown in figure  <dig>  in this report, we show that vdrs have similar selectivity for vitamin d ligands across a range of vertebrate species that include sea lamprey , zebrafish , african clawed frog , mouse, and human . although the functions of vitamin d in basal vertebrates are not well understood, the ability to bind and be activated by vitamin d ligands has been conserved across vertebrates.

pxrs, on the other hand, show extensive sequence divergence across species  <cit> . in this report, we demonstrate that pxr activators can produce effects similar to those described in mammals and chicken in both the primary hepatocytes and livers of zebrafish. these effects include increases in cyp3a-like activity , cyp2c-like activity , and mrna transcription of mdr <dig>  in zebrafish, both synthetic  and endogenous  ligands can produce these effects. in contrast, classic pxr-like effects were not elicited in either sea lamprey or african clawed frog primary hepatocytes by a range of compounds that activate pxrs from other species. the pxrs for the african clawed frog are very divergent from other species in multiple respects:  ligand selectivity ,  tissue expression pattern , and  developmental expression pattern   <cit> . our results provide further evidence that additional xenobiotic-response pxrs or related nrs are not found in the african clawed frog genome. it is an unresolved evolutionary question why african clawed frog  lack an nr such as car or pxr that can respond to a diverse assortment of potentially toxic endogenous and exogenous molecules  <cit> .

the nr repertoire in jawless fish has not been well-studied, with the exception of vdr  <cit>  and sex and adrenocortical steroid receptors  <cit> . as one of the most basal extant vertebrates, these animals can provide helpful evolutionary perspective. for the sea lamprey, we were unable to find any compounds that increased testosterone 6β-hydroxyation or fluribiprofen 4-hydroxylation in primary hepatocytes , even though the lamprey hepatocytes had substantial basal levels of both activities. coupled with our failure to find a pxr-like gene in the preliminary release of the sea lamprey genome , the available data suggest that pxr gene may not exist in the sea lamprey. if true, then vdr is either the evolutionarily older nr1i or, alternatively, pxr gene have been lost during some or all jawless fish lineages.

the properties of the putative ciona intestinalis ortholog to vdr and pxr demonstrate that invertebrate and vertebrate nr1i receptors have diverged markedly in ligand selectivity. the civdr/pxr does not respond to vitamin d ligands and, in a separate manuscript, we will report lack of sensitivity of the civdr/pxr to bile salts, steroids, typical pxr-activating xenobiotics, and fat-soluble vitamins other than vitamin d . the civdr/pxr was found to be activated only by a small number of planar, synthetic compounds including n-butyl-p-aminobenzoate, carbamazepine, 6-formylindolo-  <dig> -b-carbazole, and tcdd . there are no clear correlates of vitamin d or bile salts yet described in invertebrates, and as a result, endogenous ligands for the civdr/pxr would likely be different from those for vertebrate vdrs and pxrs. ciona intestinalis is, however, capable of synthesizing steroid hormones and also accumulates cholesterol and other sterols from dietary sources  <cit> . the endogenous activators of the civdr/pxr may be as yet undescribed steroidal molecules that have structural similarity to vertebrate vitamins and/or bile salts. alternatively, civdr/pxr may be activated by exogenous ligands relevant to its marine environment.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that vdr ligand selectivity is highly conserved across vertebrate species. using primary hepatocyte and in vivo models, we demonstrate classic pxr-mediated effects in liver cells from zebrafish but not the african clawed frog. using functional and comparative genomic approaches, we failed to find evidence of pxr gene in sea lamprey, suggesting vdr may be the evolutionarily older gene or that pxr gene have been lost in some cartilaginous fish lineages. vertebrate vdrs and pxrs have markedly different ligand selectivity from the vdr/pxr from the chordate invertebrate ciona intestinalis indicating substantial functional divergence during evolution.
