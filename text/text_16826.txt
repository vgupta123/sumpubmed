BACKGROUND
cereals are the world's basic staple food and they provide an energy and protein source for many populations, particularly in the developing world. unfortunately, cereal grain losses during storage can reach up to 50% of the total harvest in some countries, which represents a world-wide loss equivalent to thousands of millions of euros  <cit> . grain weevils sitophilus spp.  are well-known as major primary pests of stored cereal grains causing damage and rendering the grain more susceptible to attack by secondary insect pests such as tribolium.

the genus sitophilus includes three cereal feeding species . interestingly, all three species share an intracellular symbiosis with a gram-negative γ-proteobacterium  <cit> . symbiotic bacteria  are transmitted maternally to the offsprings and, at an early stage of host embryogenesis, these bacteria induce the differentiation of specialized host cells  that house the bacteria, protect them from the host immune system  <cit> , and form a symbiotic organ  that persists throughout the larval stages  <cit> . endosymbiotic bacteria balance the insect diet within the cereal grains, which are starch-rich but poor in amino acids, lipids and vitamins  <cit> . this improves mitochondrial energetic metabolism and impacts, thereby, on the insect fitness, flight ability and invasive power  <cit> .

the control of these storage insects is mainly mediated by use of synthetic insecticides, which generate high environmental costs and lead to insecticide resistant strains  <cit> . consequently the development of methods facilitating molecular manipulation of these insects is of wide interest. as insect physiology and reproduction are drastically disturbed in the absence of endosymbionts, one innovative strategy would rely on a better understanding of host symbiont interaction.

sequencing of the sitophilus endosymbiont genome, along with the development of expressed sequence tags helps to the better knowledge of the weevil biology and physiology  <cit> . one very promising method for generating targeted down-regulation of gene expression in a wide range of organisms is rna interference   <cit> . rnai also has evolved into a powerful tool for probing gene function in drosophila, tribolium, caenorhabditis elegans and mice. delivery of dsrna or sirna into a cell triggers abrogation of the target mrna. previous experiments have shown the feasibility of using rnai to abrogate the expression of gene transcripts in several insects  <cit> .

a number of animal cells have been shown to naturally take up exogenous dsrna and use it to initiate rnai silencing. in some organisms, such as drosophila and bombyx mori, certain cells show an efficient uptake of dsrna but they seem to be unable to transmit this dsrna to other cells in the body  <cit> . organisms, such as c. elegans, can both take up dsrna and spread it systemically to elicit an rnai response throughout the entire organism. interestingly, the first systemic rnai response in insects was documented in the flour beetle tribolium castaneum: an injection of dsrna into the larvae results in specific gene silencing in adults  <cit> . this effect can also be transmissible between generations  <cit> . this coleopteran species is closely related to sitophilus both phylogenetically and ecologically.

we thus undertook research to access the biological and physiological aspects of the sitophilus system based on the use of genomic tools. the weevil lifestyle and behavior limits embryonic, larval and nymphal development to within the grain only. thus, weevils cannot survive or reproduce on cereal flour in the way that tribolium insects do. here, we present new rearing conditions that allow experimental access to different embryonic and larval stages of the cereal weevil sitophilus. this system enables us to keep insects alive outside the cereal grains for the whole life cycle. to test the protocols for gene silencing in sitophilus we have selected a gene specifically expressed in the bacteriome, which encodes the peptidoglycan recognition protein   <cit> . using injected dsrna, we present evidence of systemic rnai in the weevil sitophilus spp.

methods
insect rearing
insects from sitophilus zeamais species  were reared as described in  <cit> . larvae normally grow inside the wheat grains until they emerge as adults one month after the egg laying, at  <dig> °c and 70% relative humidity . for rnai experiments, third-instar larvae were dissected out of the grains and kept alive in a moist atmosphere at  <dig> °c for the length of the experiment.

using glass plates filled with packed flour  for artificial rearing
normally cereal weevil larvae fail to feed outside the grains for behavioral reasons. to overcome this barrier, we have set up an artificial system to mimic the compactness of the cereal grain, which consists of filling with wheat flour the space between two glass plates separated with  <dig>  mm-thick spacers . weevil individuals  are deposited between two layers of packed wheat flour. we first deposit the first flour layer between the glass plates, then the lavae, and finally we recover the larvae with a second flour layer. this system could also be adapted in an eppendorf tube.

to access the insect embryonic and post-embryonic stages, both embryos and third-instar larvae were raised within the gpf and kept at  <dig> °c and 70% rh until the adults emerged. females were allowed to lay eggs on starch pellets  over a period of  <dig> hours and the embryos were collected by dissolving the starch in water. embryos were transferred immediately into the gpf system and left in an incubator until the adults emerged. third-instar larvae were removed directly from the wheat grains after dissection.

dsrna synthesis and injection
the method used to synthesize dsrna is similar to that described by  <cit> . the primers were designed with the software e-rnai, available at . for the wpgrp <dig> gene, we used the primers 5'wpgrp1-t7dsrna and 3'wpgrp1-t7dsrna that match within the coding sequence, and for the gfp gene we used the primers 5'gfp-t7dsrna and 3'gfp-t7dsrna . the nucleotides in bold are from the t <dig> rna polymerase promoter.

recombinant plasmids pcr <dig> -topo-wpgrp <dig>  <cit>  and pw8-gfp  <cit>  were used as a matrix to amplify, respectively, wpgrp <dig> and gfp with bd advantage  <dig> polymerase mix . pcr products were cleaned with a nucleospin extract ii kit  and were used as templates for in vitro dsrna synthesis using a megascript rnai kit . after synthesis, the dsrna was precipitated overnight at -80°c with  <dig>  m sodium acetate,  <dig>  μl glycogen and  <dig> volumes of 100% ethanol, resuspended in water to a final concentration of  <dig>  μg/μl. the purity and the integrity were determined by nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis. the rna was kept at -20°c prior to injection within the following  <dig> days.

 <dig> ng of dsrna  were injected into the dorsal and posterior part of third-instar larvae using the nanoinject ii nanoinjector  and they were kept in the gpf system for  <dig> days. bacteriomes were subsequently isolated for rna extraction.

total rna extraction and cdna synthesis
bacteriomes were dissected  from the fourth instar larvae and total rna was extracted by rnaqueous®-micro , a micro-scale rna isolation kit, as described in the manufacturers' procedure that includes a dnase treatment final step. after purification, the rna concentration of each sample was measured by the nanodrop® spectrophotometer and total rna quality was checked by electrophoresis. reverse-transcription into the first strand cdna was carried out using the first strand synthesis system for rt-pcr kit .

real-time rt pcr transcript quantification
quantitative measurements were performed on rna samples originating from  <dig> independent replicates. the quantification was performed with a lightcycler® instrument using the lightcycler fast start dna master sybr green i kit . data were normalized using the ratio of the target cdna concentration to that of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  gene. the expression of this gene is not significantly influenced by the treatments and it is similar to the expression of the ribosomal protein l <dig> gene . primers were designed to amplify fragments with less than  <dig> bp; wpgrp1-for and wpgrp1-rev generate a wpgrp <dig> fragment of  <dig> bp in length, and gapdh-for and gapdh-rev generate a gapdh fragment of  <dig> bp in length .

the pcr reactions were carried out in lightcycler 96-well plates in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  μl of cdna samples  and  <dig>  μl of light cycler®  <dig> sybr green master  <dig> mix, with  <dig>  μl of  <dig> mm of each primer,  <dig>  μl h2o and  <dig> μl of mastermix. after  <dig> min at 95°c, the cycling conditions were as follows:  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> s, 56°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> s. for product identification, a melting curve was constructed at the end of each pcr by heating for  <dig> s at 66°c and then increasing the temperature up to 95°c with increment rates of  <dig> °c/s. reactions were achieved by cooling at 40°c for  <dig> s.

the pcr efficiency  is calculated from the slope of the standard curve, which is obtained with different matrix quantities. e = 10-1/slope, in this study e was  <dig> % for the gapdh and  <dig> % for the wpgrp1) and, for the individual samples, the crossing point  and the concentration  of the wpgrp <dig>  transcripts were determined. as the quantification relies on the pcr efficiency of each experiment, ratios were then normalized with the gapdh. the relative ratio for each sample was calculated according to the formula: /conc. gapdh ). normalized data were analyzed using the one-way anova and tukey hsd post hoc test  <cit> .

expression of recombinant protein in escherichia coli for antibody preparation
total cdna from larval bacteriomes of sitophilus zeamais served as a template in pcr amplification for isolating the wpgrp <dig> cdna.

the primers used were for-wpgrp <dig> cdna and rev-wpgrp <dig> cdna . the resulting dna encoded  <dig> residues of the mature protein. the pcr product  was cloned into a ptrc-his-topo expression vector  and the resulting vector was introduced into an e. coli top <dig> strain. the nucleotide sequence of the synthesized gene was checked by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into the e. coli bl <dig> strain. expression of the recombinant protein wpgrp <dig> flanked with  <dig> histidines at n-terminus was induced by  <dig> mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density of  <dig>  at 30°c for  <dig> hours.

bacterial lysates were prepared by sonication in buffer a, ph  <dig> containing  <dig> mm sodium phosphate,  <dig> mm nacl and lysozyme to a final concentration of  <dig> mg/ml. the fusion protein bound to a protino-ni column  was eluted with buffer a containing  <dig> mm imidazole after the column had been washed with buffer a. the eluted fraction was dialyzed against buffer containing  <dig>  m tris-hcl ,  <dig> mm edta and 10% glycerol. the protein was mixed with 2× sds loading buffer and then, separated by electrophoresis in a  <dig> % acrylamide gel. next, the protein band was cut, n-terminal sequenced, and sliced into pieces for injection into rabbit to generate polyclonal wpgrp <dig> antiserum at covalab lyon , which was harvested  <dig> days after the initial inoculation.

western-blot analysis
western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence  western blotting analysis system . the protein samples from the bacteriome were mixed with the sample buffer, boiled for  <dig> min, and loaded onto a  <dig> % sds-page. the proteins were blotted onto a sheet of pvdf membrane . after blotting, the membrane was blocked by incubation in a 3% gelatin solution, incubated with anti-wpgrp <dig> antiserum solution  at room temperature for  <dig> h and washed in tbst . for normalization, blots were probed with a β-tubulin antibody raised from the drosophila melanogaster β-tubulin . the membrane was then incubated with 1: <dig>  diluted anti-rabbit igg-peroxydase antibody produced in goat . after repeated washing, the membrane was incubated with ecl detection reagents  and exposed to a film.

RESULTS
in this paper, we have first developed a new protocol to allow artificial rearing of weevils with access to the different stages of development and, secondly, we have demonstrated that rnai technology can be applied to inhibit gene expression.

applying an artificial rearing methodology for weevil manipulation
unlike tribolium, weevil larvae are unable to feed on wheat flour or to survive outside cereal grains for behavioral and morphological reasons. larvae require a compact texture that applies pressure on their back, which is required for an access to the food with their mandibles. to mimic this structure, we have set up an artificial rearing apparatus that consists of depositing weevil embryos and larvae between two layers of packed wheat flour . to access the later stages of the weevil life cycle , larvae were directly harvested from grain dissection. early development is accessible using the embryo stages recovered from 2- to 4-hr layings on starch kernels. embryos are collected once the females have laid by dissolving starch in water. they can either be manipulated or transferred to the gpf system to obtain the later developmental stages. survival rates presented in table  <dig> show that up to 34% of embryos succeeded in reaching the adult stage. when larvae are transferred and raised in the gpf, the yield is close to 100% .

* the natural development time from the embryo to the adult of symbiotic weevils  is arround  <dig> days.

this system is of interest to applied and fundamental sciences as it allows easy access to different stages. drugs and molecules of interest could be mixed with the flour and, thus, be tested directly on the insect variants.

testing rnai-mediated gene silencing in sitophilus
rnai was tested on sitophilus insects with the wpgrp <dig> gene as a target. we recently identified the wpgrp <dig> gene by suppression subtractive hybridization while screening for genes, which expression is upregulated in the bacteriome tissue  <cit> . to investigate the wpgrp <dig> function in more detail, we have raised a wpgrp <dig> polyclonal antibody and we have confirmed the presence of a high amount of wpgrp <dig> protein within the bacteriome by western blot analysis .

when third instar larvae were injected with sterile pbs or with gfp_dsrna, the wpgrp <dig> transcript level in the bacteriome was within the same range as in the bacteriome of the uninjected control larvae. however, an injection of  <dig> ng of wpgrp1_dsrna in the larval hemolymph leads to a 98% reduction in the target gene, compared to gfp_dsrna control in the bacteriome wpgrp <dig> transcript levels . furthermore, this downregulation at the transcript level also affects the amount of wpgrp <dig> protein in the bacteriome . these data highlight the efficiency of rnai gene silencing in sitophilus insects and show that the rnai technique can be successfully used to knockdown target genes in the bacteriome tissue.

CONCLUSIONS
rnai is a method by which dsrna can be introduced directly into animals to trigger significant suppression of specific gene expression. in the light of our data, establishing the systemic rnai pathway in this cereal weevil paves the way for more detailed comprehensive studies, on a molecularly level of weevil biology. the systemic rnai pathway may also provide opportunities for developing species-specific, and, hence, ecologically friendly pest control methods. genomic approaches have recently provided  <dig>  unigenes, which will help to develop genome-wide rnai applications addressing fundamental questions in cereal weevil physiology, development and gene regulation.
