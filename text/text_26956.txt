BACKGROUND
yersinia enterocolitica is a globally disseminated gastrointestinal pathogen which is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, through ingestion of contaminated food or water  <cit> . human clinical infections most commonly occur in young individuals and are associated with acute diarrhoea, terminal ileitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis and pseudo-appendicitis  <cit> . critical elements for pathogenesis are the high pathogenicity island , carrying the siderophore-mediated iron uptake system named yersiniabactin, and the virulence plasmid pyv. while the hpi and pyv are absent in avirulent strains, they are both conserved among highly virulent strains of the three pathogenic yersinia species, y. pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis and y. enterocolitica. the 70-kb plasmid encodes a type iii secretion system  and a set of yop effector proteins which, after injection by the t3ss into host cells, inhibit several host immune mechanisms which enable the bacteria to survive in the host environment  <cit> .

y. enterocolitica strains are heterogeneous and are classified into  <dig> biotypes  according to biochemical properties  <cit> . biotype 1a strains, lacking both hpi and pyv plasmid, are considered as non-virulent in mice, whereas biotypes  <dig> to  <dig>  which lack hpi, are low virulence   <cit> . these five biotypes belong to the y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica and are generally isolated in europe and japan . biotype 1b , harboring both hpi and pyv plasmid, is highly virulent  and predominant in north america   <cit> . more than  <dig> serotypes of y. enterocolitica have been described; however only few of them are virulent with serotypes o: <dig>  o: <dig> , o: <dig>  o: <dig>  o: <dig> and o: <dig> being the most pathogenic to humans  <cit> . in the past, y. enterocolitica bioserotype 1b/o: <dig> strains were predominant in the united states  <cit> . nowadays these strains are also isolated in other countries; nevertheless, bioserotype 4/o: <dig> strains are the most commonly y. enterocolitica strains found over the world  <cit> ,  <cit> .

many yersinia research laboratories use in their studies two mouse-virulent y. enterocolitica 1b/o: <dig> strains, named  <dig>  <cit>  and wa- <dig>  <cit> . y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> is an american isolate from a fatal-septicemia patient  <cit>  and has been widely used in murine infection models. y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> was isolated from the blood of a human patient and proved to be highly virulent for mice and rats  <cit> . recently, in an attempt to identify chromosomal variations underlying the different properties of high versus low virulence strains, the genome of the highly virulent strain  <dig>  <cit>  has been compared to genomes of low virulence strains  <cit> . however, a complete comparative characterization of highly virulent 1b/o: <dig> strains with each other had not been performed. in this context, the sequence of the pyvwa- <dig> has been recently determined, showing global similarity to pyv plasmids of other y. enterocolitica strains but with noticeable differences in the amino acid sequences of the t3ss proteins sych, yopm, lcrv and yscp  <cit> . phenotypic differences in autoagglutination experiments  <cit>  and results from our pilot experiments with strains  <dig> and wa- <dig>  displaying differences in bacterial growth curves and optical density-cellular mass correlation in vitro, suggested that these two strains possessed distinct virulence and colonization properties.

in this work, we demonstrated that strain wa- <dig> overcame strain  <dig> in the colonization of spleen and liver during in vivo co-infection experiments. genome comparison between the genomic sequence of strain  <dig>  <cit>  and a high-quality whole-genome sequence of strain wa- <dig>  presented in this study, allowed the identification of putative virulence factors which may account for the different in vivo phenotypic behavior of these two 1b/o: <dig> strains.

RESULTS
comparison of the infection ability of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> versus strain wa- <dig> in mouse model
y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> is a hyper-virulent strain with increased colonization in mice
in order to directly compare the virulence efficiency of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> and y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig>  we infected  <dig> groups of mice with the same total cfu of strain  <dig>  strain wa- <dig>  or a 1: <dig> mix of both. intra-peritoneal infection was used to enable accurate and controlled injection of the dose of interest into a limited number of mice. figure  <dig> indicates the bacterial loads in spleens and livers of the  <dig> groups of mice. mice infected with strain  <dig> contained significantly lower bacterial loads than mice infected with strain wa- <dig>  both in the spleens  and in the livers . mice co-infected with 1: <dig> mix of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> and y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> contained significantly more bacteria in liver samples, as compared to the livers of mice infected with strain  <dig> alone . however, no significant difference was shown between bacterial counts in livers of mice infected with strain wa- <dig> alone and with 1: <dig> mix of both strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> . in addition, bacterial colonization in spleens of mice infected with individual versus combined strains was not significantly different.

digoxigenin-labeled probes specifically differentiate between y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> and y. enterocolitica strain wa-314
two strain-specific digoxigenin-labeled probes were designed for differentiating y. enterocolitica  <dig> and wa- <dig> . the strain 8081-specific probe targets the putative hemolysin gene in the yapi region, while the probe specific for strain wa- <dig> targets a region inside the colicin operon specifically acquired by strain wa- <dig> . the two probes were tested on plates with cultivated single-strain and mixed-strain colonies. two membranes were placed sequentially on each plate and then hybridized with probes hem_ <dig> and col_wa, respectively. as expected, colonies on membranes derived from strain 8081-plates were all detected by probe hem_ <dig>  whereas probe col_wa gave no signal. probe hem_ <dig> did not detect any colonies on membranes replicated from strain wa-314-plates, while wa- <dig> colonies were all recognized by probe col_wa. on mixed-strain membranes, probes hem_ <dig> and col_wa detected different colonies, all colonies gave a signal with the respective probe and no colonies were recognized by both probes, indicating sensitivity and specificity of the developed test .

y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> overcomes  <dig> in co-infection experiments
to investigate whether y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> equally colonize the organs of co-infected mice, we applied the optimized colony hybridization experiment  on bacteria extracted from both spleens and livers . y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig>  on average, accounted for 80% of the total yersinia loads in spleens and livers of the co-infected mice. only in mouse number  <dig> strain  <dig> surpassed strain wa- <dig>  however, the total bacterial count in this mouse’s spleen was the lowest in this study , suggesting that inoculation was not correctly performed. from our own experience, there is one strongly deviating result within a group of ten mice. for these reasons, mouse number  <dig> was not taken into account for statistical analysis. thus, the results of the co-infection experiments clearly indicated that strain wa- <dig> could out-compete strain  <dig> for colonization of host organs.

whole genome comparison of two y. enterocolitica 1b/o: <dig> strains
general features
we present here the first whole-genome high-quality sequence of y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> and compare it to the published genome of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig>  <cit>  . genome sequencing and assembly of the  <dig> contigs of strain wa- <dig> genome resulted in  <dig> large scaffolds and  <dig> contigs, with an average g + c content of  <dig> %; one additional scaffold constituted the pyv plasmid . the genomes of the two y. enterocolitica 1b strains share  <dig>  orthologous coding sequences . the yersinia genomic islands  <dig> and  <dig>  are conserved, as are the virulence-associated determinants ail, inv, the lps operon, the flagella and urease clusters, the two general secretion pathways yts <dig> and yts <dig> and the chromosomal t3ss ysa . 

names and locus tags refer to the genome of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig>  <cit> .

mobile elements
the largest source of genetic variation between strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> is represented by genomic islands and prophages . in particular, the yapi  and the ygi- <dig> are absent from y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig>  the ygi- <dig> of strain  <dig> is a putative integrated plasmid variably present in other y. enterocolitica 1b strains, whereas the virulence-associated yapi is a 66-kb region located within the plasticity zone of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig>  <cit> . this pathogenicity island is integrated between an intact and a partial trna-phe copy that is complete in wa- <dig>  the yapi carries encoded plasmid-related functions and virulence determinants such as a type iv secretion system, a putative hemolysin, a toxin-antitoxin system  and an arsenic-resistance operon. most differences between the genomes of strains wa- <dig> and  <dig> are due to prophages or prophage remnants. we identified  <dig> prophage-like regions  in y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig>  encoding numerous hypothetical proteins that may also contribute to the high virulence of this strain. considering the prophage diversity, two of the wa- <dig> prophage regions, ywa- <dig> and ywa- <dig>  appear to be highly similar to prophages in strain  <dig>  Φye <dig> and Φye <dig>  and Φ <dig>  respectively. since these regions are not located in the same chromosomal context, they are likely strain-independent acquisitions. a 28-kb p4-like prophage in strain wa- <dig>  is located in a region corresponding to ygi- <dig>  a 19-kb putative integrated plasmid in strain  <dig>  this wa-314-specific prophage encodes a pilv-like protein , which may be a part of an ancient type iv pil operon, and contains a shufflon n-terminal region highly similar to adhesion exoproteins in y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica and in y. intermedia. it has been shown that type iv pili are used by enterobacteria during adhesion to and invasion of the human intestinal cells  <cit> . whether the wa-314-specific pilv-like protein enhances bacterial intestinal colonization has to be addressed. 

y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> specific genes
genes specifically present in y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> include an additional restriction-modification  system, a four-gene putative colicin cluster and a xenobiotic-acyltransferase -encoding gene. the rm cluster, present also in y. frederiksenii, consists of  <dig> genes , encoding an ecorii-like type ii restriction endonuclease, a very-short-patch repair  endonuclease, a cytosine methylase and a dna-binding protein. restriction modification systems defend bacteria against foreign dna, by means of the endonuclease that recognizes non-methylated cytosines of incoming dna and cleaves it at defined sites  <cit> . the host dna is protected from cleavage as the internal cytosines are modified by the methylase activity; however, this methylation increases c to t mutations, which are in turn recognized and repaired by vsr proteins  <cit> . colicins are bacteriocins, proteins produced by bacteria which are lethal for closely related strains. colicins are genetically organized in operons, with a variable genetic structure containing one or more genes encoding colicin, immunity, and lysis proteins  <cit> . the cluster found in y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> genome is composed of four annotated genes , encoding two putative immunity proteins and two putative colicins. it is located near a phage anti-termination protein-encoding gene, a transposase and a pilus chaperone-encoding gene, reflecting a similar structure in other yersinia species, such as y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica bioserotype 4/o: <dig>  <cit> . our spot-on-lawn assay could not detect any colicin activity in y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> against strain  <dig> and the control strain e. coli k <dig>  even after mitomycin c induction . thus, the colicin operon seems to be not active under the tested in vitro conditions. the xat protein  belongs to a family of resistance enzymes that catalyze the acetylation of a variety of hydroxyl-bearing acceptors such as chloramphenicol and streptogramin. it may be implicated in the inactivation of xenobiotics, leading to resistance.

the insecticidal toxin cluster, described in biotype 2– <dig> strains, was not found in the sequence of y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> genome, in contrast to previously reported experimental data  <cit> .

newly identified potential virulence genes
y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> harbors a 635-aa outer membrane protein , which has only 23% of sequence similarity with its orthologous in strain wa- <dig>  a 902-aa putative autotransporter . these two proteins are situated in the same genomic region, indicating a common chromosomal origin and subsequent mutations during the evolution of the two strains. interestingly, both genes have a low g + c content:  <dig> % in strain  <dig> and  <dig> % in strain wa- <dig>  autotransporters are known virulence factors in gram-negative bacteria, as they mediate bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation, as well as adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells. all classical autotransporters share a common organization: a signal peptide followed by an n-terminal passenger domain and a c-terminal translocator domain, with the passenger domain being involved in pathogenesis  <cit> . the protein encoded by strain  <dig> has an autotransporter beta-domain at the c-terminus, but no known domains at the n-terminus. the protein of strain wa- <dig> contains a pertactin-like passenger domain at the central region and an autotransporter beta-domain at the c-terminus, a typical organization found in the homologous aida-i protein in escherichia coli <cit> . both proteins carry no signal peptide, according to in silico prediction algorithms . however, as signal peptides have no high sequence homology among autotransporters  <cit> , the signalp program may not recognize the presence of signal peptides in the two analyzed amino acid sequences. the dissimilar sequences of the passenger domain of these two proteins may be responsible for the specific adhesion properties of y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig>  further support for this possibility comes from another putative adhesin  in strain  <dig>  which is only 75% identical to the homologous protein in strain wa- <dig> .

fimbriae  are biological structures involved in adherence to host epithelial cells and important virulence factors for several diseases affecting the urinary, genital and gastrointestinal tracts  <cit> . a type  <dig> fimbrial operon was identified in y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> as region of difference among the yersinia species  <cit> . the dna sequence of this operon is 84% similar to the operon in strain wa- <dig>  in addition, two fimbrial proteins in strain  <dig>  show only 40% of sequence similarity with the orthologous proteins in strain wa- <dig> . these proteins are absent from y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica strains and, therefore, can be considered specific factors for highly virulent strains.

pyv plasmid-encoded genes
the nucleotide sequence of the pyvwa- <dig> was, as expected, nearly identical to the previously published sequence  <cit> . the pyvwa- <dig> sequence was also compared to the pyv plasmid sequence of strain  <dig>  besides two repeat regions, the main differences were found in two t3ss protein-encoding genes, yscp and yopm. the amino acid sequence of the yscp protein, a component of the t3ss injectisome which determines the length of the needle, varies within y. enterocolitica species in the specific number of three repeated motifs   <cit> . consistent with these data, strain  <dig> harbors a 1359-bp gene, encoding a 452-aa yscp protein, while in strain wa- <dig> yscp is a 1617-bp gene encoding a protein of  <dig> residues, with  <dig> additional repeats . interestingly, yscp proteins from low virulence strains y. enterocolitica y <dig> and w <dig>  possess  <dig> extra repeats absent from highly virulent strains of serotype o: <dig>  the t3ss effector yopm is a leucine-rich repeat  protein of unclear function. yopm sequences from different yersinia strains contain duplications and deletions in the number of lrrs, with consequent variability in the yopm length  <cit> . yopm from y. pestis co <dig>  for example, has  <dig> lrrs, while yopm from y. enterocolitica strains y <dig> and w <dig> have  <dig> lrrs. the yopm gene in strain  <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> residues with  <dig> lrrs, while in strain wa- <dig> yopm is a 505-aa protein with  <dig> lrrs . in particular, the yopm sequence from pyvwa- <dig>  which is 100% identical to the yopm sequence from the o: <dig> strain a127/ <dig>  has  <dig> additional copies of lrr12-lrr13-lrr <dig>  

phylogenetic position of y. enterocolitica strain wa-314
to gain insights into the evolution of y. enterocolitica subspecies, we selected  <dig> strains representing the three y. enterocolitica groups, classified according to the virulence grade: avirulent ; low virulence , y <dig> and y8265) and highly virulent . the y. pestis strain co <dig> was selected as outgroup, known a priori to be an outlier to the ingroup sequences and chosen to root the tree.

the concatenated tree  sorts three monophyletic clusters for the three y. enterocolitica groups, as expected. the intragroup genetic distances show that biotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are clustered more tightly than biotypes 1a and 1b; therefore genomes of low virulence strains have lower plasticity, when compared to avirulent and highly virulent strains, which present a higher degree of genetic variation. concerning the evolution of y. enterocolitica, this analysis indicates that the three groups evolved independently from a common ancestor, with biotype 1a strains being the first to diverge, followed by biotype 1b and 2– <dig> strains. according to our phylogeny reconstruction, non-pathogenic strains are evolutionarily closer to y. pestis than the pathogenic y. enterocolitica.

discussion
highly virulent yersinia enterocolitica strains have been extensively used to clarify the virulence/fitness mechanisms of this heterogeneous gastrointestinal pathogen. the use of different bioserotype 1b/o: <dig> strains is normally not considered a variable factor in experimental animal infection procedures. in this study, however, two y. enterocolitica 1b/o: <dig> strains,  <dig> and wa- <dig>  demonstrated different virulence behaviors in mice, both in single strain infection and in competition assays, with strain wa- <dig> showing a higher virulence/fitness level. a further characterization of these two strains was therefore necessary to uncover the genetic background behind the phenotypic differences.

genome comparison between a high-quality sequence of y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> and the published sequence of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig>  <cit>  revealed, besides an overall similarity in gene composition, important differences in genomic islands and prophages. in pathogenic bacteria, genomic islands and prophages represent a large source of inter- and intra-species genetic variation  <cit> . pathogenicity islands also play an essential role in spreading virulence genes through lateral gene transfer, an evolutionary process by which bacterial pathogens acquire new virulence factors en bloc. our analysis revealed that the ygi- <dig> and the pathogenicity island yapi, carrying a type iv secretion system known to be involved in y. pseudotuberculosis virulence  <cit> , are absent from strain wa- <dig>  moreover, both  <dig> and wa- <dig> strains harbor prophages that have no or low similarity. we observed that the mobile genetic elements tend to occupy the same positions in both 1b/o: <dig> genome backbones. the p4-like prophage ywa- <dig>  for example, is inserted in strain wa- <dig> in the same genomic region as the ygi- <dig> plasmid-like element in the chromosome of strain  <dig>  this speaks in favor of the presence of “hot-spots” for the integration of the acquired genetic material. such hot spots, besides being integration sites, might represent genome regions with high gene expression potential, an important factor for the homing of laterally acquired genetic clusters. taken together, these data emphasize the important role of horizontal gene transfer and mobile genetic elements in the evolution and genetic diversification among pathogenic yersinia.

besides mobile elements, the genomes of y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> differ in a number of gene clusters and single protein-encoding genes. strain wa- <dig> specific acquisitions include a xat-encoding gene, a rm system and a putative colicin cluster. strain  <dig>  on the other hand, harbors a specific toxin/antitoxin system, similar to the higba family. nucleotide polymorphisms in homologous genes also contribute to the genetic variation between strains  <dig> and wa- <dig>  the plasticity of y. enterocolitica 1b/o: <dig> genomes mirror the versatile lifestyles of this heterogeneous bacterial species, found in human, animal and environmental sources, and results from the on-going process of adaptation. by living in contact with various microbial communities in different niches, y. enterocolitica experiences frequent opportunities for exchanging genetic material.

one of the main challenges of comparative genomics is to identify genes involved in pathogenesis. virulence factors are generally involved in adherence, invasion, colonization of the host, interference with host defense mechanisms and damage to the host  <cit> . a putative autotransporter, an adhesin and two fimbrial proteins show low sequence similarity in the genomes of strains  <dig> and wa- <dig>  together with a type iv pilus, present only in the genome of strain wa- <dig>  they may contribute to adhesion and colonization of host tissues. such new potential virulence determinants may be able to explain the phenotypic differences observed in vivo between y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig>  the real involvement of these proteins in virulence, however, needs to be elucidated.

established virulence-associated determinants of y. enterocolitica have been extensively studied and reviewed  <cit> . one group is pyv plasmid-encoded, such as yada, the t3ss secretion machinery ysc and the t3ss effectors yops, while the other group is encoded within the chromosome, for example inv, ail and the hpi. the genomes of y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> show no significant differences in the sequences of these classical virulence markers, except for the plasmid-encoded effector protein yopm and yscp, the “needle ruler” of the yersinia injectisome. the function of the yopm protein is not completely understood. however, it has been shown to form a complex with two intracellular serine/threonine kinases, protein kinase c-like  <dig>  and ribosomal s <dig> protein kinase  <dig>   <cit> . in y. pseudotuberculosis, the interaction with rsk <dig> requires the region from lrr <dig> to c-terminus of yopm  <cit> , whereas prk <dig> binding involves the lrr <dig> to lrr <dig> region of yopm  <cit> . both rsk <dig> and prk <dig> interaction domains of yopm are critical for virulence, e.g. by inducing production of il- <dig>  as demonstrated by different yopm mutant proteins  <cit> . interestingly, y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> encodes a yopm of  <dig> residues with  <dig> lrrs, while yopm of strain wa- <dig> has  <dig> residues and  <dig> lrrs. therefore, further studies are required to elucidate whether the different number of lrrs in yopm proteins of strain  <dig> and wa-314: i) generally results in the interaction of the corresponding yopm proteins with different targets in the host, ii) especially causes distinct interaction or binding affinity with prk <dig> and rsk <dig> and iii) has different consequences on the virulence of y. enterocolitica in the mouse infection model. yscp, a protein highly variable within y. enterocolitica species, determines the needle length of the yersinia spp. injectisome, with a linear correlation between the size of yscp and the needle length  <cit> . it has been shown that the y. enterocolitica needle needed to have a minimal length to be fully functional  <cit> . such a minimal needle length, which also correlated with the length of the yada adhesin, provided optimal contact between the needle and the host cell membrane. thus shorter yscp proteins or longer yada proteins led to suboptimal yop translocation  <cit> . curiously, yscp of y. enterocolitica strain  <dig> contains 452-aa, while in strain wa- <dig> yscp is 538-aa long. as yada length is unchanged between y. enterocolitica strains wa- <dig> and  <dig> , we propose that the longer yscp protein in strain wa- <dig> would allow higher yop translocation efficiency than strain  <dig> and, therefore, improved virulence activity. this would partly explain the different phenotypes of strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> observed in the co-infection experiment.

small reproducible differences between the in vitro growth rates of y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> have been documented, with strain wa- <dig> growing slightly faster than strain  <dig> . thus the lower in vivo colonization ability of strain  <dig> might be related to its growth behavior and to metabolic and regulatory factors, without regard to virulence determinants. however, no obvious differences in metabolic and nutrient acquisition systems have been found between strain  <dig> and wa- <dig> genomes. in vitro growth conditions for yersiniae are also extremely different from those in vivo: for example, yersinia optimal growth temperature is 27°c, in contrast to the in vivo temperature of 37°c, and most virulence factors are only expressed at 37°c. thus a correlation between the in vitro growth rates of y. enterocolitica strains  <dig> and wa- <dig> and their in vivo colonization properties is unlikely, but such a possibility cannot be completely excluded.

it is well known that pathogenesis induced by bacteria is dependent on bacterial proliferation in the host. successful invasion of and growth in host niches requires adaptation of the pathogen to the host micro-environment. micro-environmental factors influencing bacterial colonization of the host include nutrient composition and availability in the host niches, on one hand, and the host defense mechanisms, on the other hand. in the case of co-infection or co-existence of different pathogens in the same micro-environment, a further important factor is represented by the ability of each pathogen to compete against each other for host niches and nutrient sources. pathogens are adapted to those micro-environmental factors. they carry adhesion molecules, which enable invasion of specific tissue and cell types, and metabolic systems, such as iron-binding proteins. they also express virulence factors, which counteract immune responses of the host, and molecules, like bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of closely related bacterial strains, thus enabling competition against other pathogens. in our co-infection model  with two highly virulent y. enterocolitica strains, strain wa- <dig> seemed to be better adapted than strain  <dig> to the micro-environmental factors encountered in host tissues like spleen and liver . thus the present data suggest that y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig> is a hyper-virulent strain. in fact, mice infected with strain  <dig> showed lower bacterial loads than mice infected with strain wa- <dig> and strain  <dig> could not colonize the host as efficiently as strain wa- <dig>  even in the absence of a competitor pathogen. the colicin operon found in strain wa- <dig> showed no in vitro activity, but we cannot exclude that this colicin could be effectively expressed in vivo at the host’s environmental conditions, thus probably conferring additional advantage to strain wa- <dig> against strain  <dig>  finally, the identified putative adhesion proteins, that have been shown here to be specifically acquired by strain wa- <dig>  may also contribute to the higher capacity of this strain to invade the host.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that y. enterocolitica highly virulent strains exhibit significant strain-to-strain genotypic and phenotypic differences, resulting in differences in their pathogenicity. accordingly, virulence of pathogens can be increased, e.g. by acquiring new genes and/or improving the function of essential virulence proteins. thus, understanding the genetic factors which allow bacterial hyper-virulence would enable the design of improved therapeutic strategies against such strains.
