BACKGROUND
mouse mutant models have been extensively used to identify candidate genes regulating complex traits, such as growth and body fat  <cit> , providing insight into the metabolic pathways regulating these traits. in the present study we used the high growth  mouse mutant model in combination with chromosome  <dig>  congenic and subcongenic strains to map genes that affect body composition, and genes that may interact with the growth hormone/igf signaling pathways  <cit> . briefly, high growth mice are 30-50% larger than wild type littermates with body composition and organ weights proportional to their body weight. these differences in growth rate are due to a spontaneous deletion of three genes  on mouse chromosome  <dig>  the key gene regulating growth in this mouse model is socs <dig>  which is part of the jak/stat signaling pathway and mediates the actions of growth hormone/igf pathways.

major qtl affecting body weight , carcass ash  and carcass protein  were previously identified in our laboratory on mouse chromosome  <dig> between  <dig> mb and  <dig> mb using a c57bl/6jhg/hg  × cast/eij  f <dig> intercross  <cit>  —“hg” refers to the hg locus, i.e. the deletion itself; whereas hg refers to the high growth mouse on a c57bl/6j background, i.e. c57bl/6jhg/hg. mouse chromosome  <dig> has a high density of genes, many affecting relevant metabolic processes such as appetite , energy expenditure and storage , secondary signaling cascades, and transport proteins . the high density of plausible functional candidate genes makes it difficult to ascertain if the qtl is the product of a single gene with one large effect, or the combined effect of several genes in close proximity each with a small effect. thus, to further study mmu <dig>  congenic strains were developed by introgressing cast/eij segments into the backgrounds of hg and c57bl/6j  to fine map qtl identified by corva et al. and farber et al.  <cit> . among the mmu <dig> congenics developed in our laboratory, the hg.cast–  is of particular importance as it contains fatq <dig>  and fatq <dig>  wg <dig>  wg <dig> and wg <dig> qtl within its donor region  <cit> . this strain was used to develop a panel of subcongenic strains on an hg background whose donor regions target the peaks of these previously identified qtl.

here we report a significant improvement in the mapping resolution of the fatq <dig> qtl using the combined data from five overlapping cast subcongenic strains and the data from a hg2d f <dig> intercross  <cit>  which provides strong evidence that fatq <dig> is the result of at least two independent qtl more or less  <dig> mb apart in mice homozygous for hg. furthermore, we report an integrative approach used to fine map one of these qtl, fatq2b, to a critical interval of  <dig>  mb containing the “gnas imprinted locus” on distal mmu <dig> 

RESULTS

qtl partitioning and fine mapping analyses
qtl partitioning of body fat mass to individual subcongenic regions
additive effects for each subcongenic strain were estimated by multiple linear regression as described in the supplemental methods . significant additive effects of cast alleles on total fat , gonadal , mesenteric , retroperitoneal  and femoral  fat pad weights were observed among the five subcongenic strains . differences in fat distribution were observed across the congenics , but in general cast alleles tended to decrease all fat pad weights . thus only the total fat  results are discussed in depth. the cast alleles significantly reduced tf in hg2d- <dig>  hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> . only the additive effect was significant  in these strains, i.e. the dominace effect was not significant. a sex × additive  interaction was detected only in hg2d- <dig>  where cast alleles increase tf in male mice. these phenotypic results support the location of fatq <dig> and fatq <dig>  <cit> , and suggest a qtl × sex interaction for fatq <dig>  in contrast, phenotypic results of the subcongenics hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> demonstrate that what was previously described as fatq <dig> is actually two qtl: fatq2a and fatq2b .figure  <dig>

 subcongenic strains used for the fine mapping of fatq <dig> and fatq <dig>  reported locations of fatq <dig> and fatq <dig> are displayed below the congenics   <cit> .



farber and medrano  <cit>  previously reported that these qtl are sex-biased, and in these subcongenics it is mainly observed in hg2d- <dig>  the additive effect of cast alleles was similar in males from hg2d and hg2d- <dig>  whereas females of hg2d show a greater reduction in tf than any other strain. from a theoretical standpoint additive effects observed in hg2d should be the cumulative sum of the independent additive effects observed in the subcongenic strains . hg2d females show a reduction of − <dig>  g tf,  <dig> x the sum of hg2d- <dig>  hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig>  suggesting an undetected transgressive qtl that may control the remaining − <dig> g  <cit> . in contrast, hg2d males have a reduction of − <dig>  g tf, which is roughly the equivalent to the sum of hg2d- <dig>  hg2d- <dig>  hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> . the same can be said for hg2d- <dig>  where a reduction of − <dig>  g tf in hg2d- <dig> is roughly  <dig> x the sum of hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> , suggesting an additional qtl on hg2d- <dig> that accounts for the remaining − <dig>  g .

differences in the distribution of body fat were also observed across strains. the hg2d- <dig> strain had significant reductions in gfp and mfp, whereas no significant differences were found in rfp and ffp between cast/cast and b6/b <dig> littermates. in contrast, hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> show significant reductions in gfp, rfp and ffp, but no significant differences in mfp between cast/cast and b6/b <dig> littermates. thus, loci within the unique donor region of the hg2d- <dig> strain primarily regulate mfp since this is the only strain with significant differences in mfp. all other fat pads  are primarily regulated by the unique donor region of the hg2d- <dig> and its overlap with the hg2d- <dig> strain, suggesting that loci regulating these fat pads are contained within the overlapping regions of these congenics .

linkage analysis of fatq2
individual interval mapping of the four fat pads and total fat reveal the presence of two qtl. the strongest qtl affecting all fat pads was located in the overlap region of strains hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> at  <dig> mb  with a 95% confidence interval  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb  and a second qtl affecting total body fat and body weight was identified with a peak at  <dig> mb  within the overlap of the hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> strains  . these results suggest the presence of two qtl segregating in the hg2d- <dig> strain that explain the effects of fatq <dig> 

this locus was previously observed as one large qtl by farber and medrano  <cit> , however, the fine mapping provides evidence that fatq <dig> is the result of two qtl that flank the peak of the original fatq <dig>  thus, suggesting that the peak of fatq <dig> in the previous analysis was the combined effects of two independent qtl with additive effects on body fat . these two qtl reduce total fat in the non-overlapping hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> subcongenics .

fine mapping fatq2b to the “gnas imprinted locus”
fine mapping of total fat with composite interval mapping  positioned the peak fatq2b qtl at  <dig>  mb , with a confidence interval ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb encompassing the gnas imprinted locus. the summary of the replications of composite interval mapping  consistently suggest a  <dig>  mb interval between  <dig>   and  <dig>  mb   as the peak of fatq <dig>  this consistency of the peak location of fatq2b was maintained even after changing the window and step size to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ; and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively in a 3 ×  <dig> factorial design , as described in the fine mapping methods. these analyses define the peak of fatq2b to a region containing  <dig> putative candidate genes that regulate body fat deposition , of which  <dig> are associated with body weight, body fat, and energy metabolism  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the match™ search for transcription factor  binding sites showed  <dig> tfbs in the promoter sequences of rab22a, gnas and ctsz. the  <dig> bp upstream of the gnas transcription start site had one region at − <dig> bp whose sequence is conserved among mice and human. this region contains three tf binding sites  of which only hnf- <dig> has one snp . in humans, one snp ga on the functional promoter of gnas showed an association with weight loss during a  <dig> day fasting period. individuals with the gg genotype had a 5 ±  <dig>  kg weight loss, whereas the aa genotype had a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg difference  <cit> . however, gnas was not found differentially expressed between cast/cast and b6/b <dig> homozygous in fat and whole brain from both hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> f <dig> littermates.

discussion
the present subcongenic experiments provides strong evidence that the fatq <dig> qtl, previously reported by farber and medrano  <cit> , is composed of two qtl each with small effects. congenic f <dig> intercrosses of five subcongenic strains with overlapping mmu <dig> donor regions were used to fine map fatq2b, and in combination with high density genotyping in a large population allowed reducing the size of the qtl peaks to  <dig>  mb intervals and the identification of  <dig> positional candidate genes. differential expression experiments reported here and known mouse knockout phenotypes suggest rab22a and gnas as candidate genes for the fatq2b qtl, though, additional experiments are required to confirm any gene as the causal gene for fatq2b.

the original peak of fatq <dig> mapped to  <dig> mb  <cit> , within the donor region of the hg2d- <dig> strain. our results suggest that cast alleles in this region increase total fat in congenic males by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g  . other fat qtl, such as aibl, epfp <dig>  mob <dig>  and scfq <dig> have also been localized to this region  <cit> . however, the effects of the latter qtl on body fat were much larger than the effects observed in the hg2d- <dig> strain and were not sex dependent. the fatq <dig> qtl was originally identified by farber and medrano  <cit>  in a population of  <dig> f <dig> mice from the hg2d congenic strain. this data was merged with the subcongenic data since the hg2d congenic is comparable to our five strains and a small peak at  <dig> mb for ffp , corresponding to fatq <dig> .

the original peak of fatq <dig> in farber and medrano  <cit>  maps to  <dig> mb, corresponding to the unique donor region of the hg2d- <dig> congenic. however, the present analysis suggests that the fatq <dig> qtl is the product of two independent qtl; the first qtl located at  <dig>  mb, fatq2a, and a the second qtl at  <dig> mb, fatq2b. . results from the hg2d- <dig> congenic show decreases in gfp, rfp and ffp, consistent with the effects of fatq <dig>  subcongenic analysis of this region suggests that the effects of cast alleles on fat pad weights are greater in the hg2d- <dig> strain than in the hg2d- <dig> strain, consistent with the hypothesis that alleles present in the overlap region of the hg2d- <dig> and the hg2d- <dig> strain affect these traits. however, this does not completely explain the reductions in body fat by cast alleles in hg2d- <dig> . the significant decrease of tf observed in the hg2d- <dig>  hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> strains is likely the result of cumulative allelic effects on individual fat pads each controlled by more than one qtl .

the combined results from the hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> strain suggest that gfp and rfp are affected by loci present in overlap region of these strains , and mfp is affected by loci within the unique region of the hg2d- <dig> strain as hg2d- <dig> mice did not show significant differences in mfp. furthermore, cast alleles present in the hg2d- <dig> strain reduce gfp in female mice and cast alleles from the hg2d- <dig> strain reduce gfp equally in both sexes . this suggests a sex-specific regulation of affecting gfp among loci of the fatq2a qtl present in the unique region of hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig>  the combined results strongly support the notion that fatq <dig> is not the result of a single qtl with one large effect, but rather the combined cumulative effect of at least two qtl each with a smaller contribution to tf, shown by the reduced tf of cast/cast mice from the hg2d- <dig> and hg2d- <dig> strains . with the current panel of subcongenic strains the presence or absence of a third qtl at  <dig>  mb –the location of the original fatq <dig> qtl cannot be confirmed as it is not uniquely isolated with a subcongenic strain.

the physical limit of fatq2b is the hg2d- <dig> donor region, which spans mmu  <dig> from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. though, by integrating results from the linkage analysis, the most significant region is a  <dig>  mb interval between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb. this region contains  <dig> known genes, of which gene expression of rab22a, stx <dig>  atp5e, gnas and ctsz were quantitated by rt-qpcr in gfp and whole brain from  <dig> hg2d- <dig> f <dig>  and  <dig> hg2d- <dig> f <dig> mice. ctsz showed differential expression in brain of hg2d- <dig> mice only, whereas rab22a showed differential expression in both tissues and both strains analyzed . the region proximal to the peak of fatq2b, between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, contains  <dig> predicted genes,  <dig> known genes,  <dig> riken transcripts and one microrna. from the  <dig> known genes and  <dig> riken transcripts; dok <dig>  mc3r, bmp <dig>  and pck <dig> have been associated with obesity  <cit> . the region distal to the fatq2b peak, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, has a segmental duplication that may be polymorphic in copy number between c57bl/6j and cast/eij.

differential expression of the genes listed above was first checked in microarrays between cast/cast congenic and control littermates. it is known that microarrays have limitations for qtl gene discovery, therefore, other positional candidate genes should not be discarded based on expression data alone  <cit> . in this study data from microarrays was used for an initial screening of differentially expressed genes that were later analyzed by rt-pcr in this study, but untested genes are still considered as plausible candidates.

fine mapping analyses, combined with the hg2d microarray and the rt-qpcr expression data in whole brain and gfp, suggest rab22a as a plausible candidate for the fatq2b qtl affecting body fat. however, published literature also shows body weight and obesity phenotypes between gnas knockout and control mice  <cit> , and has been implicated with performace traits in cattle  <cit> , and carcass quality in pigs  <cit> . other possible explanations for the observed phenotypic variation are possible snp in the regulatory regions of the genes or variation at the transcription factor binding sites that may change the affinity of the transcription factor to regulate a gene  <cit> . with our current data it is not possible to discard genes outside the qtl peak that remain within the hg2d- <dig> congenic. however, the replicated cim approach encourages further analysis of a  <dig>  mb region around d2mit <dig>  though, the accuracy of replicating cim to positionally clone individual genes has not been fully investigated, this method prioritized seven genes among the  <dig> known genes contained in the hg2d- <dig> strain. several sources contributed information to the fine mapping of fatq2b and support the use of this approach as an entry point to prioritize candidate genes in a qtl with a high density of genes.

the statistical methods im and cim used to fine map fatq2b have several limitations when applied to mapping using subcongenic strains  <cit> . these are 1) the inability to detect epistasis, 2) the generation of ghost qtl, and 3) over fitting the analysis using too many markers as covariates. the inability to detect epistasis is caused by changing the native genotypes of interacting genes in the engineered panel of subcongenics, thus, changing the interaction itself or confounding the epistatic nature of the interaction to an additive effect in the individual subcongenics. furthermore, any epistatic interactions with background alleles outside the congenic region are undetectable. the generation of ghost qtl is of major concern. however, this is unlikely in this experiment as the two identified qtl are observed in two independent subcongenics. though, at this stage it is still unknown if a single gene is responsible for each qtl or if it is the cumulative effect of several small effects from many genes. lastly, over fitting the qtl model by adding too many covariate markers. over fitting the cim may result in the increase of false positives. for this study, three covariate markers were used in all cim analysis. decreasing to two markers or increasing up to five markers did not have a significant effect in the results presented here.

the novel approach of replicated cim and using a summary statistic of the lod scores to generate a lod profile has not been reported in the scientific literature. this approach averages the results of multiple cim runs each with different imputation of missing markers and with unique covariate markers, resulting only one or very few markers with detectible signals after. changing parameters such as step size and window size provides an assesment of the robustness of the location of the peak. however, once lod scores are averaged, only those robust markers, consistently having high lod scores, will result in a peak in the lod profile. this can explain why only the strongest qtl, fatq2b, was able to retain median lod score of  <dig> after the  <dig>  replications of cim. despite that this method has not been used elsewhere and the lack of alternative methods for subcongenic strains, the results obtained by this approach suggest further investigation of the “gnas imprinted locus” and the effects that cast alleles have on obesity at this locus.

the  <dig>  mb peak of fatq2b suggested by the replicated cim is the combined result of having a large mapping population , a high density snp panel , and the replication of cim with several parameter combinations. though, fatq2b has several genes involved in energy metabolism, protein transport and gtp cell signaling; analyses of gene expression in five genes suggests rab22a as candidates, and the obesity phenotype of the gnas knockout suggests these two genes as strong candidates for fatq2b, though further analyses are required to confirm and ascertain the biological mechanisms of these genes in order to understand how fatq2b exerts its effects on body fat.

CONCLUSIONS
an integrative approach that included congenic and subcongenic qtl analysis, a large mapping population, and high density genotyping successfully partition one major qtl, fatq <dig>  into at least two qtl, and fine mapped the fatq2b qtl on distal chromosome  <dig> to  <dig>  mb. the use of replicated composite interval mapping provided a  <dig>  mb region corresponding to the peak of fatq2b. the confidence interval of fatq2b contained several genes for which gene expression was measured, of these; rab22a and gnas are positional candidates that show differential gene expression for fatq2b.
