BACKGROUND
the sheep is an established model organism for medically relevant research in cardiology  <cit> , reproductive medicine  <cit> , respiratory medicine  <cit>  and many other fields. the sheep is particularly important in the field of orthopedics, because the dimensions of ovine long bones allow the use of implants designed for application in humans, and the bone mineral composition as well as the metabolic and remodeling rates are similar to those in humans  <cit> .

although bone usually heals spontaneously, failures in bone healing remain an important medical and research challenge. bone healing is a highly complex regenerative process that is directed by a series of cytokines and growth factors and leads to restoration of skeletal integrity. despite advances in the field of orthopedic research, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in standard and impaired healing is still limited, and delayed unions and non-unions are still major clinical problems.

a tibial osteotomy healing model in sheep is well established in our laboratory, and its biological and mechanical characteristics have been previously published  <cit> . the model has been used to simulate standard healing by means of the application of a rigid external fixator following osteotomy as well as delayed healing by application of a rotationally unstable external fixator.

to date, molecular research in the sheep has been hampered by the paucity of information about the sheep genome and gene sequences. therefore, a systematic comparison of the expression characteristics of the transcriptome between a standard and impaired healing osteotomy has not yet been performed. massively parallel dna sequencing platforms, widely referred to as "next-generation sequencing" , are changing the playing field in biomedical research by enabling the comprehensive and relatively inexpensive analysis of genomes and transcriptomes  <cit> . ngs technologies have opened the door to genome scale experiments in organisms that lack comprehensive genome or transcriptome information, making it possible to assemble novel transcripts and identify differential regulation in a single experiment  <cit> .

we have previously used est sequencing to investigate genes differentially expressed in the course of standard bone healing in sheep  <cit> . in this study, we compare the gene expression profiles of standard and delayed bone healing in the sheep by means of next-generation sequencing and computational analysis of the sheep transcriptome to identify transcripts of  <dig>  ovine genes, for  <dig>  of which no mrna sequence was previously available. we identified characteristic clusters of gene expression including several with striking differences between standard and delayed healing, some of which have known roles in the extracellular matrix and skeletal development.

RESULTS
sheep osteotomy model
a total of  <dig> female merino mix sheep  with a mean weight of  <dig> kg  received a standardized mid-shaft tibial osteotomy  stabilized with a monolateral external fixator. group i  received a rigid external fixator, which has been previously shown to support standard healing  <cit> . group ii  was treated with a mechanically critical external fixator, which allowed free rotation through a highly stiff stainless-steel tube set in two tapered roller bearings, thereby producing a distinct delayed healing  <cit>  . the standard healing group stabilized with the rigid external fixator showed uneventful healing with complete bony bridging by day  <dig> or  <dig>  in contrast, the delayed healing group stabilized with the rotationally unstable external fixator did not reach union by day  <dig> . calcified histology at day  <dig> and  <dig> revealed newly formed bone in the periosteal callus that was covered by a layer of osteoid seam in the control group. furthermore, in regions of intramembranous bone formation periosteally, mineralization of deposited osteoid was visible . in contrast, in the delayed healing group, an increased amount of osteoid covering the newly formed bone and less mineralization of deposited osteoid was found at day  <dig> .

massively parallel sequencing
to date, the use of the sheep to investigate the genetic correlates of bone healing has been limited owing to the lack of ovine genome and transcriptome sequences. the purpose of the current project was therefore to generate an initial sheep transcriptome using next-generation technologies and to perform an exploratory analysis of differential gene expression between standard and delayed healing in the sheep.

we developed a bioinformatics workflow  that would take advantage of ovine sequences where possible and otherwise use homologous sequences from mouse and cow for mapping short reads. we analyzed one flowcell with eight lanes of samples at different time points of standard and delayed healing. pooled samples were obtained from 5- <dig> animals each at four different time points . each sample was run in a single lane of the flowcell, resulting in 18- <dig> million  <dig> bp reads per lane corresponding to 9- <dig> million unique reads per lane with a total of  <dig> million reads including  <dig> million unique reads .

lanes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> correspond to standard bone healing on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and lanes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> to delayed healing on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

de novo transcriptome assembly
prior to de novo assembly the reads from all lanes of the flowcell were pooled and duplicate reads were removed to generate a list with each different sequence represented only once. the best mean read score for a single unique read was preserved. the list of unique reads was then trimmed by removing base calls from the 3' end of the read with phred  score  <cit>  of  <dig> or less. a total of  <dig>  ovine mrna genbank entries  and  <dig>  ovine ests were downloaded from the ncbi database using the e-utils  <cit> . ncbi reference sequences containing one or more ambiguous bases  were removed from further analysis, such that  <dig>  mrna and  <dig>  est sequence files were available for the assembly. de novo assembly using the mrnas, the ests, and the uniquified and trimmed reads was then performed using velvet  <cit> . velvet output a total of  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp. oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce extended contigs from short read sequencing technologies in the absence of any genomic assembly. it clusters the contigs from a preliminary assembly by velvet into small groups called loci and uses a de bruijn graph-based algorithm to construct transcript isoforms  <cit> . the contigs produced by velvet were postprocessed using oases yielding  <dig>  loci  comprising a total of  <dig>  extended contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bp.  <dig>  loci exceeded the minimum length threshold of  <dig> bp and were included in further analysis . for each of the  <dig>  loci, the contig with the highest oases confidence score was chosen for further analysis. the average length of these contigs was  <dig> bp.

following all quality control and filtering steps, there were a total of  <dig>  mappable genes. for  <dig>  of these genes, positive counts were detected in all  <dig> lanes, and these genes were used for the further analysis of differential expression. a gene with known mrna sequence refers to a gene with a gene symbol for which at least one mrna sequence was found. note that mrna sequence entries assigned to hypothetical genes were not included, and that multiple sequence entries were found for some genes. a unique mappable sheep gene refers to a set of one or more oases loci that could be mapped to a unique gene symbol via blasting to sheep, cow, or mouse sequences. the total number of sheep genes with known rna sequence is derived from the union of de novo assembled genes and previously sequenced genes,  <dig>  of which overlapped.

blast was used to identify the gene models by comparing the contig sequences to available sheep, cow, and mouse mrna sequences. the resulting hits  were filtered for matches with significant e-value according to the species being compared and percentage of identical matches meeting the requirements shown in table  <dig>  in comparison to ovis aries, more reference sequences are available for bos taurus including various splice variants. therefore, a higher identity cut-off was used to identify cow ortholog transcript models.  <dig>  contigs were annotated to a gene symbol using this pipeline. the average length of the annotated contigs was  <dig>  bp, and the longest single annotated contig was  <dig>  bp long and annotated to dystonin . there were  <dig>  contigs which could not be assigned to any mouse, cow or sheep transcript, and these were excluded from further analysis.

only blast matches fulfilling both conditions were considered as true orthologs.

read mapping
the de novo transcriptome was then combined with all available  <dig>  ovine mrna sequence files as well as all  <dig>  bovine mrna sequence files from ncbi for mapping of the short reads with bowtie  <cit> . the bowtie mapping algorithm was used to map short reads with a seed length of  <dig> and a maximum of three allowed mismatches in the seed. in each lane each read was mapped to a single gene. on average, about 75% of the short reads could be mapped . the use of bos taurus transcripts for the mapping substantially increased the number of mappable reads .

the sections entitled sheep  and cow  indicate the percentage of the corresponding target sequences for the mapped reads for each of the eight lanes. see also figure  <dig> 

evaluation of differential gene expression
each of the lanes corresponded to a pooled sample of 5- <dig> animals at one time point. as one lane per condition was available, differential expression between conditions was evaluated using the audic-claverie method  <cit>  in order to enable exploratory analysis. the raw counts of the reads mapped as described above were used for the audic-claverie analysis. in addition, rpkm analysis was used to estimate the fold change. gene expression was compared between the time point  <dig> days and those at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days for both standard and delayed healing. in addition, each of the individual time points was compared between the standard and the delayed healing groups. a gene was considered to be differentially expressed if the audic-claverie p-value was <  <dig> - <dig> and the fold change of the normalized  expression values was at least  <dig> in either direction . there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed between standard and delayed healing at day  <dig>   <dig> at day  <dig>   <dig> at day  <dig>  and  <dig> at day  <dig>  within the time course of standard healing, there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed between day  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> between day  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> between day  <dig> and  <dig>  within the time course of delayed healing, there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed between day  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> between day  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> between day  <dig> and  <dig>  this corresponded to a total of  <dig> distinct genes showing differential expression in at least one comparison. q-pcr analysis of the pooled samples for  <dig> selected genes confirmed the analysis of the rpkm values .

clustering and go analysis
hierarchical clustering was performed to identify groups of genes with similar expression profiles. a total of  <dig> clusters were identified by visual inspection. figure  <dig> shows the expression profile for standard and delayed healing groups. the heat plot on the left displays the expression patterns for all genes. separate plots are shown for each cluster with the average and standard deviations of the rpkm expression values. there were clusters with relatively minor differences between the standard and delayed healing groups, and several others with marked differences between the groups. model-based gene set  gene ontology analysis  <cit>  was performed for each of the clusters, and up to three go terms with a marginal probability of at least 50% and the highest number of annotated genes are shown . additionally, mgsa was performed for the entire set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes .

the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were analyzed as the study set in comparison to a total of  <dig>  mapped ovine genes for which a human gene symbol was identified. the column 'marginal' indicates the marginal probability of a term being in the 'active' state, and the column 'count' shows the counts of genes in the study  and population  sets as x/y.

the go terms include terms such as extracellular matrix and chemokine activity with well known roles in skeletal biology and bone healing.  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes were annotated to striated muscle contraction, and  <dig> to contractile fiber. the role of α-smooth muscle actin fibroblasts in the contraction of skin wounds is well known; smooth-muscle actin expressing connective tissue cells have also been shown to take part in fracture healing  <cit> , and our results could be a reflection of this phenomenon. therefore, we investigated all differentially expressed genes annotated to contractile fiber . most of these genes are localized in clusters e and g  and were more highly expressed in standard healing at day  <dig> and  <dig>  and more highly expressed in the delayed healing group at day  <dig>  consistent with a delay in the regulation of these genes . several of the genes annotated to striated muscle contraction and contractile fiber overlap with genes annotated to calcium ion binding . these genes were also significantly more highly expressed in standard healing at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  where clear signs of mineralization were shown by histology . in contrast, differentially expressed genes that were annotated to cartilage development  showed a characteristic upregulation in the latter two time points of delayed healing . these genes are a subgroup of genes that are annotated to the go term skeletal system development, which was significant in the mgsa analysis of cluster f .

especially during the early phase of bone healing, fundamental processes such as inflammation are strongly influenced by the mechanical conditions under which bone healing takes place  <cit> . in our experiment, genes annotated to response to wounding  were consistently more highly expressed in the standard healing group . this term is a parent term of inflammatory response  and related to defense response . in agreement with the biological observation that the inflammatory phase of bone healing takes place in the first few days  <cit>  most genes annotated to these terms showed the highest expression at day  <dig> both in standard and in delayed healing. in a similar fashion genes annotated to cell division  showed the highest expression levels at day  <dig> . these genes were consistently more highly expressed in the delayed healing group at the later time points . genes involved in complement activation were significantly overrepresented in all  <dig> differentially expressed genes  and were from day  <dig> on significantly more highly expressed in the standard healing group .

discussion
most bony injuries heal without problems, but there are several conditions under which enhancement of the repair process would be of great benefit to ensure the rapid restoration of skeletal function. animal models are essential for investigating the different molecular processes underlying bone healing. several studies have identified molecular differences between standard healing fractures and experimentally induced delayed healing or non-unions  <cit> , but these studies have been performed in small-animal models. currently, investigative tools are still limited for analyses in large-animal models such as sheep and relatively little research has been performed into sheep genetics. however, the sheep model is critical for medical applications because the size of the bone, the loading, and the time to healing are comparable to human fracture healing  <cit> .

a virtual sheep genome has been constructed by mapping ovine contigs obtained by  <dig> sequencing onto bovine sequences that had been rearranged in sheep order  <cit> . at present, however, only low coverage genomic data is available. the sequences presented in this work will represent a valuable and complementary resource to current efforts to sequence the sheep genome.

in previous studies, we have focused on investigating the expression of specific genes during mechanically induced delayed healing in the sheep osteotomy model compared to standard healing  <cit> . the present study is the first conducting a systematic comparison of the expression characteristics of the transcriptome between a standard and impaired healing osteotomy in a large-animal model. a limitation of our study is the fact that only a single pooled sample could be investigated for each condition. the audic-claverie test allows an estimation of the statistical significance of observed differences in the counts of genes that are interpreted as differential expression, but may tend to overestimate significance. for this reason, we applied a stringent p-value cutoff . with this proviso, our study has identified a large number of differentially expressed genes corresponding to biological categories that are thought to be most relevant for bone healing. for instance, transcriptome-wide analyses revealed that about 9%  of the genes found to be differentially expressed during bone healing are annotated to extracellular matrix. some of these ecm genes are typically found in cartilage. semi-rigid fixation associated with delayed healing results in a larger cartilage component of the callus, which persisted longer  <cit> . in agreement with this observation, our study showed higher expression of genes related to cartilage formation after mechanically critical fixation with higher instability of the bone fragments. cytokines play important roles during bone healing and were shown to be significantly overrepresented in the mgsa analysis. we additionally identified a large set of genes annotated to striated muscle contraction and contractile fiber that displayed a characteristic shift in delayed bone healing. genes from these categories have not previously been known to be differentially expressed in bone healing. more research will be required to identify the cell types within the fracture callus that express these genes and to elucidate their functional role. the fact that many genes whose proteins are involved in binding calcium ions are differentially expressed provides leads as to the molecular correlates of the differential mineralization observed in delayed bone healing.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq is an approach to expression profiling based on next-generation sequencing technologies, whereby a sample of rna is converted to a library of cdna fragments attached to adaptors. individual molecules, with or without amplification, are then sequenced in a high throughput fashion  <cit> . for model organisms such as the sheep for which relatively few gene sequences have been previously published, rna-seq allows combined identification of previously unsequenced transcripts together with transcriptome analysis. prior to this study, partial or complete mrna sequences corresponding to  <dig>  ovine genes were publicly available. in the course of this project, partial or complete transcript sequences were generated for  <dig>  ovine genes, corresponding to a nearly nine-fold increase in the number of sheep genes with publicly available sequence information. a fasta file with sequences of the longest available transcript for each of the  <dig>  ovine genes is available as additional file  <dig>  the short reads have been deposited in ncbi's short read archive.
