BACKGROUND
burkholderia cenocepacia is a member of the burkholderia cepacia complex , a group of phenotypically similar gram-negative bacteria  <cit>  that are opportunistic pathogens and sometimes cause serious life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . infection in cf patients may result in asymptomatic carriage, but often leads to a rapid decline of the lung function and in some cases to the "cepacia syndrome", characterized by necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis  <cit> .

b. cenocepacia and other members of the bcc demonstrate high-levels of intrinsic resistance to most clinically relevant antibiotics, complicating the treatment of the infection  <cit> . multi-drug resistance in cf isolates is defined as resistance to all of the agents in two of three classes of antibiotics, such as quinolones, aminoglycosides, and β-lactam agents, including monobactams and carbapenems  <cit> . multiple antibiotic resistances in bcc bacteria have been attributed to reduced permeability of the bacterial outer membrane  <cit> , expression of antibiotic modifying enzymes  <cit> , and alteration of cellular targets  <cit> . information relating to the contribution that drug efflux systems play in the drug resistance of bcc bacteria is limited, as only a few multi-drug efflux pumps have been described to date in some clinical isolates  <cit> . in contrast, the contribution of multidrug efflux systems to antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, another cf pathogen, is well documented. two p. aeruginosa efflux pumps, mexab-oprm and mexxy-oprm, contribute to intrinsic multidrug resistance, while mexcd-oprj and mexef-oprn are responsible for the acquired antimicrobial resistance of different mutant strains  <cit> .

rnd transporters are important mediators of multi-drug resistance in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . rnd transporters form protein complexes that span both the cytoplasmic and outer membrane. the complex comprises a cytoplasmic membrane transporter protein, a periplasmic-exposed membrane adaptor protein, and an outer-membrane channel protein. the escherichia coli acrab-tolc and the p. aeruginosa mexab-oprm complexes are extremely well characterized and the three-dimensional structures of various components have been resolved  <cit> .

two rnd type multi-drug efflux pumps, amrab-opra and bpeab-oprb, have been described in burkholderia pseudomallei  and both confer resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides  <cit> . the contribution of bpeab-oprb and amrab-opra, to the intrinsic resistance of b. pseudomallei to gentamicin, streptomycin and erythromycin explains why aminoglycoside-β-lactam combinations, which are commonly used to treat suspected cases of community-acquired sepsis in any part of the world, are ineffective for the treatment of melioidosis  <cit> . furthermore, the transport of acyl homoserine lactones, involved in quorum-sensing systems of b. pseudomallei, also requires the bpeab-oprb efflux pump  <cit> . thus, targeted inhibition of bpeab-oprb could be therapeutically beneficial.

several possible strategies can be considered to specifically block the activity of these drug efflux pumps, such as jamming the outer membrane channel, generating competition at the inner membrane pump, altering the pump assembling or collapsing the energy component of the mechanism  <cit> . the activity of efflux inhibitors, such as diamine compounds, has been demonstrated in animal models of p. aeruginosa infections and two of them are in preclinical development  <cit> .

in b. cenocepacia the significance of rnd efflux systems has not been determined. however, a salicylate-regulated efflux pump that is conserved among members of the bcc has been identified  <cit> . we are focusing our research in the b. cenocepacia j <dig> strain. this strain is a prototypic isolate belonging to an epidemic clone that has spread by cross infection to cf patients in europe and north america  <cit> . previously, we identified  <dig> genes encoding putative rnd efflux pumps in the genome of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  <cit> . after the completion of the whole genome sequence  <cit> , two additional genes encoding rnd pumps were discovered. reverse transcriptase analyses showed that some of these genes are indeed transcribed at detectable levels. as a first step towards understanding the contribution of rnd pumps to b. cenocepacia antibiotic resistance we deleted genes encoding putative efflux pumps, rnd- <dig>  rnd- <dig>  and rnd- <dig>  containing the genes bcas0591-bcas <dig> , bcal1674-bcal <dig>  and bcal2822-bcal <dig> , respectively. in a previous publication, the genes encoding the membrane transporter component of the efflux pump, bcas <dig>  bcal <dig>  and bcal <dig> were referred to as orf <dig>  orf <dig>  and orf <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in this investigation we show that deletion of rnd- <dig> and rnd- <dig> genes is associated with increased sensitivity to certain antibiotics and reduced secretion of quorum sensing molecules.

RESULTS
b. cenocepacia bcas <dig>  bcal <dig>  and bcal <dig> encode rnd-type transporters
we characterized  <dig> efflux systems of b. cenocepacia j <dig> by deletion mutagenesis. these systems were selected based on their high homology to the well-characterized mex efflux pumps in p. aeruginosa. one of the identified operons, located on chromosome  <dig>  encodes rnd- <dig> and comprises the genes bcas0591-bcas0592-bcas <dig> that span nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> . bcas <dig> encodes a predicted 418-aa membrane fusion protein, followed by the rnd transporter gene predicted to encode a 1065-aa protein, and bcas <dig> encoding a 475-aa outer membrane protein. amino acid sequence analysis of the bcas <dig> gene product revealed conserved motifs and the characteristic predicted structure common to the inner membrane proteins of the rnd efflux complex. topologically bcas <dig> is a polypeptide with  <dig> predicted transmembrane alpha helices and two large periplasmic loops between transmembrane helices 1- <dig> and 7- <dig>  <cit> . a search using the national center for biotechnology information protein database with the blastp program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ revealed that the components of this efflux system shared amino acid sequence identity with the well characterized acrab-tolc, bpeab-oprb, and mexab-oprm rnd efflux pumps of e. coli, b. pseudomallei, and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in particular, bcas <dig> shared  <dig>   <dig>  56% amino acid identity with the rnd transporters acrb , bpeb , and mexb , respectively. bcas <dig> shared  <dig>   <dig>  and 50% amino acid identity with the membrane fusion proteins acra , mexa , and bpea . on the other hand, bcas <dig> shared 52% amino acid identity with oprm  and 49% with oprb , both of which are outer membrane pore proteins.

the operon encoding rnd- <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> and spans nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  the first gene, bcal <dig>  encodes the membrane fusion protein, a predicted 406-aa protein. the product of the downstream gene is a predicted 1046-aa protein that functions as an rnd transporter. the third gene, bcal <dig>  encodes the 486-aa outer membrane pore protein . blastp results revealed that bcal <dig> had  <dig> and 48% identity with the membrane fusion proteins amra  and mexc , while bcal <dig> was similar to amrb  and to mexd of p. aeruginosa , both encoding the rnd transporter. bcal <dig> was highly related to the outer membrane proteins opra of b. pseudomallei  and oprm of p. aeruginosa  and again possessed the predicted conserved structural features of outer membrane proteins that function in rnd efflux systems. a gene encoding a predicted tetr family regulator protein  is located upstream of bcal <dig> but is transcribed in the opposite direction .

lastly, the predicted operon encoding rnd- <dig>  comprising the genes bcal <dig>  bcal <dig> and bcal <dig>  is located on chromosome  <dig> and spans nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> . bcal <dig> encodes the 1066-aa rnd transporter protein, which is highly related to bpeb from b. pseudomallei  and to mexb . bcal <dig> encodes the 507-aa outer membrane protein related to oprb  and to oprm from p. aeruginosa . bcal <dig> encodes a predicted 424-aa membrane fusion protein highly similar to bpea from b. pseudomallei  and to mexa from p. aeruginosa .

to demonstrate a role for these efflux pumps in the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  we attempted the construction of single deletion mutants of each rnd gene using the method described by flannagan et al.  <cit>  . the deletion mutagenesis strategy requires expression of the endonuclease i-scei and allows for the creation of unmarked gene deletions. while attempting to generate the deletion mutants we encountered difficulties selecting recombinant colonies at a high concentration of antibiotics. similarly we also failed to identify positive colonies having targeted integration of the deletion plasmid. the latter was particularly difficult for our initial attempts to get single deletions of each of the rnd genes. we reasoned that the flanking regions of the rnd genes, which are cloned into the mutagenesis plasmid pgpi-scei to mediate targeted integration into the chromosome, share significant sequence identity between different rnd genes throughout the b. cenocepacia genome. due to these difficulties we concluded that single gene deletions could not be possible using the i-scei mutagenesis strategy. to circumvent this problem we generated plasmids designed to delete the entire operons encoding the three different efflux systems, as the dna flanking the operons was not similar between different operons encoding efflux systems. this strategy resulted in the mutant strains d <dig> , d <dig> , and d <dig> . in the case of strain d <dig>  the deletion not only included the rnd operon but also bcal <dig>  encoding a putative tetr regulator. the presence of the correct deletion in each strain was confirmed by pcr analysis and southern blot hybridization .

effect of deletion of efflux pumps operons on b. cenocepacia j <dig> drug resistance
to determine if the deletion of the targeted efflux pumps altered susceptibility to antimicrobial agents we exposed the parental strain j <dig> and the mutants d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> to a variety of antimicrobial compounds. table  <dig> summarizes the minimum inhibitory concentrations  of the different compounds tested. the wild-type strain, j <dig>  demonstrates a high intrinsic level of resistance to a variety of drugs including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and ethidium bromide. strain d <dig>  did not show any increased susceptibility as compared to the parental strain j <dig>  the inability to demonstrate growth inhibition of b. cenocepacia d <dig> is likely due to functional redundancy as this strain carries genes encoding  <dig> other rnd efflux pumps that could compensate for deletion of the rnd- <dig> operon. on the other hand, not all the rnd efflux pumps seem to share the same drug specificity, and the selected compounds could be extruded from the cell by other transporters of non-rnd families. in contrast, the deletion of the complete bcal1674-bcal1675-bcal <dig> operon  and the bcal <dig> gene, encoding a putative transcriptional regulator, led to a 8-fold reduction in the mic values for nalidixic acid as compared to the control strain j <dig> . this result demonstrates that rnd- <dig> is indeed required for antibiotic resistance and that, at least for the compounds tested, demonstrates nalidixic acid specificity as this was the only mic altered in the mutant strain.

as already mentioned, the proteins bcal <dig>  bcal <dig>  and bcal <dig> that comprise the rnd- <dig> operon share strong sequence similarity to rnd efflux pump amrab-opra from b. pseudomallei which is responsible for the efflux of aminoglycosides and macrolides in that burkholderia species  <cit> . we previously showed that the gene encoding the pump protein  was expressed at detectable levels by rt-pcr. assuming that rnd- <dig> is functionally similar to amrab-opra, the lack of aminoglycoside and macrolide resistance in the b. cenocepacia d <dig> mutant may be due to an alternative efflux pump or resistance mechanism against aminoglycosides and macrolides. to address the notion of rnd efflux pump redundancy, we are in the process of generating a complete library of rnd deletion mutants that can be screened for drug sensitivity. furthermore the i-scei deletion strategy makes it possible the construction of strains carrying multiple rnd gene deletions, which we are also pursuing.

the b. cenocepacia d <dig> deletion mutant demonstrated a  <dig> to 16-fold increase in drug susceptibility to several of the antimicrobials tested, indicating that rnd- <dig> plays an important role in the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of b. cenocepacia . in particular, strain d <dig> is more susceptible than the parental strain j <dig> when exposed to aztreonam, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tobramicin, and to different fluoroquinolones, such as nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, and sparfloxacin. furthermore, the mic of ethidium bromide was more than 16-fold lower in d <dig> than in j <dig> . the mic values for other drugs such as ampicillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, piperacillin, erythromycin, and kanamycin were not altered in d <dig> as compared to j <dig> . increased sensitivity to many antimicrobials of therapeutic importance might suggest that inhibition of rnd- <dig> function could be of benefit to cf patients colonized with b. cenocepacia.

effect of broad-spectrum efflux pump inhibitor mc- <dig>  on b. cenocepacia j <dig> and the rnd deletion mutants d <dig>  d <dig> and d4
it has been reported that mc- <dig>  efflux inhibitor has a potentiating effect in p. aeruginosa, where it lowers the mic of different fluoroquinolones  <cit> . we tested the effect of this efflux inhibitor on b. cenocepacia j <dig> and the deletion mutants d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  to initiate this analysis we determined the mic of mc- <dig>  for our bacterial strains to determine whether this compound was itself bactericidal. exposure of j <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> to mc- <dig>  yielded an mic value of  <dig> μg/ml. in contrast, strain d <dig> demonstrated a mic to mc- <dig>  of  <dig> μg/ml, indicating that this compound exerts some antibacterial effects and that rnd- <dig> is required at least in part for resistance to this compound. next, the mics of the compounds previously used to determine resistance profiles described above were re-assessed in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml of mc- <dig>  by the agar plate method. this concentration was selected as it is well below the mic value determined for each strain. exposure of the parental strain j <dig> or the mutant strains generated in this study to mc- <dig>  did not alter the mic profile for any of the strains tested. this is consistent with previous observations in b. pseudomallei where this compound did not increase drug sensitivity  <cit> .

efflux of levofloxacin in b. cenocepacia j <dig> and the d <dig> mutant
given that b. cenocepacia d <dig> demonstrated 8-fold reduction in its mic for levofloxacin as compared to j <dig>  we determined whether the levofloxacin resistance mechanism was due to active drug efflux mediated by rnd- <dig>  this was performed by a fluorometric levofloxacin uptake assay . fig.  <dig> shows that d <dig> mutant bacteria rapidly accumulate levofloxacin achieving a steady-state level within  <dig> minutes of incubation in the presence of the drug. levofloxacin accumulation was greatly increased  in d <dig> mutant bacteria as compared to the parental strain j <dig>  these results strongly support the notion that the rnd- <dig> efflux pump comprised of bcal <dig>  bcal <dig> and bcal <dig> functions as a levofloxacin efflux system. as a control, the uptake assay was also performed on mutant d <dig>  which does not show any phenotype regarding the resistance profile . the d <dig> strain behaved like the wild-type strain j <dig> , suggesting that increased levofloxacin uptake in the mutant strains is not due to a general defect in membrane permeability.

moreover, to determine whether the accumulation of levofloxacin was energy-dependent, reserpine was added to cells  <dig>  min after the addition of levofloxacin. as shown in fig.  <dig>  in the presence of reserpine, in the wild-type strain and d <dig> mutant, the accumulation of levofloxacin increased to levels close to the values shown by d <dig> mutant. this demonstrates that the accumulated levels of levofloxacin were the same under de-energized conditions. this finding suggests that reserpine is able to inhibit rnd- <dig> efflux pump, as well as the other efflux systems in j <dig> and d <dig> strains. the addition of reserpine also increased intracellular levofloxacin accumulation in d <dig> mutant , suggesting that additional efflux systems are expressed in the absence of this transporter, as previously reported  <cit> .

evaluation of acyl homoserine lactone accumulation in the growth medium of b. cenocepacia j <dig> and the d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> mutants
to determine whether the inactivated rnd efflux pumps function in the transport of quorum sensing n-acyl homoserine lactones  we evaluated the export of n-octanoyl homoserine lactone . this quorum sensing molecule was previously shown to be secreted by b. cenocepacia  <cit> . detection and quantification of c8-hsl was measured using a heterologous plasmid-based reporter assay. the plasmid pscr <dig>  which carries a β-galactosidase gene under the control of a c8-hsl responsive b. cenocepacia promoter, was transformed into e. coli dh5α and β-galactosidase activity determined in the presence of culture supernatants derived from control and mutant bacteria. the amount of this ahl in supernatants derived from strain d <dig> did not differ from the parental control. in contrast, the supernatant derived from strains d <dig> and d <dig> accumulated 30% less c8-hsl in the medium as compared to j <dig> and d <dig> . these observations suggest that the rnd transporters encoded by bcal <dig> and bcal <dig> contribute to the transport of this ahl out of b. cenocepacia.

CONCLUSIONS
employing a recently developed mutagenesis strategy  <cit> , we successfully deleted three operons encoding rnd efflux pumps in b. cenocepacia strain j <dig>  this strain is notoriously difficult to manipulate genetically, in part due to its high level of antibiotic resistance, which precludes the use of the most common selectable markers for gene exchange. the mutagenesis strategy we employed has the advantage of generating markerless deletions making it possible to repeatedly use the same antibiotic resistance cassette for subsequent gene deletions. we began our study by deleting operons encoding rnd-like efflux pumps in b. cenocepacia j <dig>  the operons were selected on the basis that they are the most closely related b. cenocepacia efflux pumps to the mex efflux pumps in p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

our results demonstrate that only two of the three operons targeted for deletion contribute to the antibiotic resistance of b. cenocepacia under the conditions tested here, and that their function contributes to the resistance of a small subset of antibiotics. levofloxacin was one of the antibiotics to which increased sensitivity could be detected and our data indicate that rnd- <dig> plays a role in resistance to this drug. the inability to demonstrate increased sensitivity to most classes of antibiotics supports the notion that there is functional redundancy in the efflux pumps expressed by b. cenocepacia. consequently, multiple rnd gene deletions in the same strain may be required to understand better their role in intrinsic antibiotic resistance. the i-scei mutagenesis system makes this possible and these experiments are currently under way in our laboratories.

multidrug-resistance efflux pumps do not only confer antibiotic resistance, but can also function to promote colonization and persistence in the host  <cit> . for example, vibrio cholerae rnd efflux systems are required for antimicrobial resistance, optimal expression of virulence genes, and colonization of the small intestine in an infant mouse model of infection  <cit> . in this study, we found reduced accumulation of ahls quorum sensing signal molecules in the growth medium of two of the rnd deletion mutants. these observations suggest that these mutants have an ahl export defect that may alter quorum sensing. importantly, it has been demonstrated that b. cenocepacia mutants lacking functional quorum sensing systems are attenuated in a rat model of lung infection  <cit> . it is likely that rnd- <dig> and/or rnd- <dig> might also be required for survival in vivo and inhibition of their function may be beneficial not only to prevent quorum sensing dependant phenomena such as biofilm formation but also to increase antibiotic sensitivity during infection.

in summary, we have demonstrated that in b. cenocepacia, rnd efflux systems contribute to antibiotic resistance and possibly to the secretion of quorum sensing molecules. furthermore our observations indicate that further investigation of rnd efflux systems in b. cenocepacia is necessary to better understand how this bacterium is able to resist antibiotic treatments in the clinic and to chronically infect cystic fibrosis patients.
