BACKGROUND
 the clinical administration of bacteriophages, referred to as phage therapy, has now been used to treat bacterial infections for nearly a century. although this type of therapy had been largely abandoned outside of eastern europe since antibiotics became available in the 1940s, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has re-established phage therapy as a viable antibacterial treatment
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that phages and phage components are effective both in animal models  and in human clinical trials
 <cit> . advances in phage delivery and storage  and genomic characterization  have made phage therapy more feasible with respect to both logistics and safety
 <cit> .

one group of bacteria that is thought to be an excellent target for phage therapy is the burkholderia cepacia complex . these bacterial species, which primarily infect patients with cystic fibrosis , are problematic because they can cause serious illness , they are capable of patient-to-patient spread , and, perhaps most importantly, they are highly antibiotic resistant
 <cit> . very few antibiotics are active against the bcc, even in combination: zhou et al.
 <cit>  tested a panel of antibiotics against bcc clinical isolates and determined that less than half of the strains were susceptible to even the most effective drugs. clinically, the most commonly isolated bcc species are burkholderia multivorans and burkholderia cenocepacia, with the latter thought to be the most pathogenic
 <cit> . bcc phage therapy trials have focused on this species and, to date, phages have been shown to be effective against b. cenocepacia in both invertebrate and mammalian infection models
 <cit> .

as b. cenocepacia infections are some of the most problematic for the cf community, the isolation and characterization of novel phages that infect this species remains a priority. many of these phages have been isolated in recent years, but only some have been fully sequenced . here, we describe the isolation and characterization of kl <dig> and ah <dig>  two novel b. cenocepacia-specific phages with identical host ranges and unique growth characteristics, but strikingly dissimilar genomes.

RESULTS
isolation, host range and morphology
kl <dig> was isolated from sewage using b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> as a host. in contrast to enterobacteria phages, which are commonly found in sewage
 <cit> , this is the first report of bcc phage isolation from this source. ah <dig> was isolated from nandina sp.  soil using b. cenocepacia c <dig>  bcc phages have commonly been isolated from both rhizospheres and soil samples, including that of onion and dracaena sp.
 <cit> .

kl <dig> and ah <dig> are very similar with respect to both host range and growth characteristics. these phages have a relatively narrow tropism, infecting b. cenocepacia k56- <dig>  c <dig>  715j, and k63- <dig>  both kl <dig> and ah <dig> exhibit a pattern of lysis that is unique in our collection of bcc-specific phages: although high titre stocks of these phages are very concentrated , these phages do not produce clear lysis in agar overlays after  <dig> h incubation like other phages that we have previously characterized
 <cit> . instead, turbid or no clearing is observed at high titres, with mottling or individual plaques observed at lower titres . at low titres, incubation at 30°c for greater than  <dig> h is required for plaque formation, but plaques are not observed if incubation is at 37°c . individual plaques are turbid with a diameter of  <dig> - <dig> mm . when tested with a panel of k56- <dig> mutants with progressive deficiencies in lipopolysaccharide  structure 
 <cit> , both phages were able to infect each mutant, suggesting that neither kl <dig> nor ah <dig> uses lps as a major receptor. 

both kl <dig> and ah <dig> belong to the order caudovirales and family siphoviridae as determined by electron microscopy. the kl <dig> virion has a non-contractile tail approximately  <dig> nm in length and a capsid approximately  <dig> nm in diameter . the ah <dig> virion is slightly larger, with a non-contractile tail approximately  <dig> nm in length and a capsid approximately  <dig> nm in diameter . the stacked rings comprising the tail structure are visible in the ah <dig> micrograph .

genome characterization
despite the similarities in phenotype between kl <dig> and ah <dig> with respect to host range and growth characteristics, the genomes of these two phages are dissimilar. restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis shows distinct banding patterns of ecori-digested kl <dig> and ah <dig> genomic dna, suggesting that their sequences are substantially different . this prediction is confirmed by the results of whole genome pyrosequencing  and is illustrated in figure
4a: in a circos plot of a promer comparison of these two phages, no regions of similarity at the protein level are observed under the parameters used.

the kl <dig> genome is  <dig>  base pairs  in length and has a  <dig> % gc content. this percentage is lower than that for most burkholderia-specific phages, which tend to have gc contents between 60–65% . we were unable to identify a kl <dig> cos site following incubation of the dna at 80°c, as the rflp profiles appeared identical both before and after heating . kl <dig> is predicted to encode  <dig> proteins, all of which have an atg start codon, except for gp <dig> which has a gtg codon .

kl <dig> is most similar to pseudomonas phage  <dig> , a siphovirus that infects pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit> . these phages are similar with respect to genome length , gc content , and predicted number of proteins . blastn comparison of kl <dig> and pa <dig> indicates that these sequences are similar over 69% of the kl <dig> genome. kl <dig> encodes a protein most similar to each pa <dig> protein from orf001–orf <dig>  . most pa <dig> proteins show limited similarity to others in the ncbi database and have not been assigned a putative function
 <cit> . of the  <dig> pa <dig> proteins with predicted functions, all but one  is similar to a kl <dig> protein: holin, terminase large subunit, head morphogenesis protein, tail tape measure protein, dna polymerase, superfamily ii helicase/restriction enzyme, helicase , and dcmp deaminase  . of the kl <dig> proteins most similar to a pa <dig> protein, the most similar is gp <dig>  and the least similar is gp <dig>  . in a circos plot of a promer comparison of these phages, the majority of the two genomes are similar at the protein level .

the ah <dig> genome is  <dig>  bp in length and has a  <dig> % gc content. incubation of the dna at 80°c caused a shift in the rflp profile , suggesting the presence of a cos site. sequencing of the shifted fragments indicates that ah <dig> has a  <dig> bp 5’ overhang cos site with a sequence almost identical  to that of burkholderia phage bcepnazgul . ah <dig> is predicted to encode  <dig> proteins . the majority of the start codons  are atg,  <dig> are gtg and  <dig> are ttg .

ah <dig> is most similar to bcepnazgul, a siphovirus isolated from soil that infects burkholderia ambifaria. like pa <dig> and kl <dig>  these phages are similar with respect to genome length , gc content , and predicted number of proteins . in contrast to kl <dig> , ah <dig> encodes proteins similar to those from a variety of bacteria and phages  and so is less closely related to bcepnazgul than kl <dig> is to pa <dig>  blastn comparison of ah <dig> and bcepnazgul indicates that these sequences are similar over 16% of the ah <dig> genome. twenty-one ah <dig> proteins are most similar to a bcepnazgul protein  and  <dig> show some similarity based on blastp analysis. of the ah <dig> proteins most similar to a bcepnazgul protein, the most similar is gp <dig>  and the least similar is gp <dig>  . in a circos plot of a promer comparison of these phages, the most similar regions at the protein level correspond to ah <dig> gp <dig>  gp <dig>  gp <dig>  and a portion of the putative capsid morphogenesis and dna packaging module .

module analysis
overview
we have identified the proteins encoded by kl <dig> and ah <dig> as belonging to four different functional categories: virion morphogenesis , lysis, dna binding , and mazg . although the proteins encoded by each phage perform many of the same functions  , the proteins themselves are dissimilar. as we discuss below, the finding that kl <dig> and ah <dig> can create nearly identical phenotypes with two dissimilar sets of proteins may be compelling evidence for convergent evolution occurring in these bcc-specific phages.

virion morphogenesis
although we have determined that kl <dig> is a siphovirus , the identity of many of the structural genes remains unknown. as discussed above, kl <dig> is most closely related to pa <dig>  a phage whose proteins have largely uncharacterized functions. based on blastp analysis, we have been able to predict the identity of only eight kl <dig> structural proteins: three involved in capsid morphogenesis and dna packaging and five involved in tail morphogenesis. gp <dig>  and gp <dig>  are similar to pa <dig> orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively, both of which have been assigned putative functions in the pa <dig> annotation . gp <dig>  is similar to the major capsid proteins of escherichia phage k1h and listonella phage ϕhsic. gp <dig> is similar to tail proteins from multiple escherichia phages including k1g, k1h, and k1ind1-k1ind <dig>  gp <dig> is predicted to be the tail tape measure as it is the largest protein encoded by kl <dig>  and it is similar to the predicted pa <dig> tape measure protein orf <dig> . finally, gp24-gp <dig> are similar to bcepnazgul tail assembly proteins. using hhpred analysis, we were able to identify an additional three proteins at a probability threshold of 75%. gp <dig> is similar to bacteriophage spp <dig> portal protein , gp <dig> is similar to λ gpfii head-tail joining protein , and gp <dig> is similar to λ gpu minor tail protein  .

in comparison with kl <dig>  the structural proteins of ah <dig> are well defined. genes 62– <dig> make up the capsid morphogenesis and dna packaging module, containing genes encoding the major capsid protein, decorator protein, prohead protease, portal protein, head-tail joining protein, and terminase subunits  . each of these proteins is similar to a bcepnazgul protein, with percent identities between 49-58%. several genes between  <dig> and  <dig> are similar to genes encoding bcepnazgul conserved tail assembly proteins, tape measure protein, and pre-tape measure frameshift protein g-t . two additional ah <dig> tail proteins were identified using blastp  or hhpred  analysis . hypothetical proteins encoded in this region are likely to be involved in tail morphogenesis based on the proximity of their genes to this module.

most tailed phages encode two tail proteins proximal to the tail tape measure gene by way of a − <dig> translational frameshift
 <cit> . we have previously identified these frameshifted genes in the bcc-specific phages ks <dig>  ks <dig>  ks <dig>  and kl3
 <cit> . using fsfinder and manual scanning for xxxyyyz motifs, we predict that kl <dig> gp18/gp <dig> and ah <dig> gp55/gp <dig> are expressed using this mechanism. the predicted frameshift site in kl <dig> is gggaaac, immediately upstream of the gp <dig> tga stop codon . a − <dig> ribosomal shift following the terminal c will allow for expression of the  <dig> aa gp <dig> and the  <dig> aa gp <dig> from the same start codon . although most phages encode their frameshifted proteins immediately upstream of the tail tape measure gene, kl <dig> encodes an intervening tail protein, gp <dig> . this organization is similar to that of escherichia coli phage hk <dig>  bacillus subtilis phage spp <dig>  methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum phage ψm <dig>  methanothermobacter wolfei phage ψm <dig>  lactococcus phages c <dig> and bil <dig>  and natrialba magadii phage ϕch1
 <cit> . the predicted frameshift site in ah <dig> is aaaaaag , the same sequence used by e. coli phage vt1-sakai, m. thermoautotrophicum phage ψm <dig>  staphylococcus aureus phages pvl and pv <dig>  lactococcus lactis phage ul <dig>  and borrelia burgdorferi prophage borreliapro
 <cit> . in the case of ah <dig>  a − <dig> shift of the ribosome following the g in this sequence will allow for the  <dig> aa gp <dig> to be expressed instead of the  <dig> aa gp <dig> . using blastp or hhpred searches, we were unable to identify the kl <dig> or ah <dig> major tail proteins. however, we predict that these proteins may be gp <dig> in kl <dig> and gp <dig> in ah <dig> as the major tail genes are generally positioned upstream of the frameshifted protein genes
 <cit> . although not present in all sequences, rna secondary structures are often found downstream of frameshift sites
 <cit> . mfold analysis of the  <dig> bases downstream of the putative kl <dig> and ah <dig> sites suggests that stem-loop structures could form in both of these regions . 

lysis
in kl <dig>  we have identified the genes putatively encoding the holin, lysin, rz and rz <dig> lysis proteins. in a blastp search, gp <dig> shows similarity to putative holin proteins of pa <dig> and bcepnazgul. tmhmm analysis of this protein indicates that it has two transmembrane domains, so gp <dig> is predicted to be a class ii holin
 <cit> . gp <dig> is similar to the endolysin of erwinia phage vb_eamp-s <dig>  and contains lysozyme and peptidoglycan-binding conserved domains. although gp <dig> does not show similarity to any rz proteins in the ncbi database, it is predicted to contain a single n-terminal transmembrane domain, characteristic of rz proteins
 <cit> . gp <dig> is predicted to be the kl <dig> rz <dig> protein as it is similar to bcepnazgul rz <dig> and lipop analysis identifies a signal peptidase ii cleavage site between positions  <dig> and  <dig> . the proportion of prolines in the predicted rz <dig> lipoprotein is low compared to previously identified rz <dig> proteins in bcc phages
 <cit> .

the same lysis proteins were identified in ah <dig>  like kl <dig> gp <dig>  the putative ah <dig> holin gp <dig> is similar to the bcepnazgul holin, has two transmembrane domains, and is predicted to be a class ii holin. although gp <dig> shows no similarity to endolysins in a blastp search, hhpred analysis reveals similarity to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic lysozyme proteins. gp <dig> is predicted to be the ah <dig> rz protein as it has a single n-terminal transmembrane domain. although manual annotation has been required for identification of the rz <dig> gene in kl <dig> and in our previous studies
 <cit> , we predict that the genemark-assigned gp <dig> is the ah <dig> rz <dig> protein. gp <dig> is similar to bcepnazgul rz <dig> and has a signal peptidase ii cleavage site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  similar to the predicted kl <dig> rz <dig>  the proportion of prolines present in this protein is relatively low . it is unclear from this analysis what protein may contribute to the unique plaque phenotype observed in both of these phages. aside from the low proportion of proline found in the putative rz <dig> proteins, kl <dig> and ah <dig> appear to have relatively standard lysis modules, suggesting that unique  proteins may be responsible for controlling lysis timing in each phage.

dna binding
of the  <dig> kl <dig> proteins similar to a pa <dig> protein with an assigned function, half of these are dna- or nucleotide-binding proteins: dna polymerase , superfamily ii helicase/restriction enzyme , helicase , and dcmp deaminase  . in addition, kl <dig> encodes a putative dna polymerase iii β subunit , exonuclease , transcriptional regulator , primase , and vsr endonuclease  . in a multi-genome analysis performed by lopes et al.
 <cit> , it was determined that pa <dig> orf <dig> is distantly related to lactococcus phage ϕ <dig> sak <dig> recombinase. when this protein was expressed in e. coli, it exhibited recombinase activity, but was found to be less efficient than λ redβ
 <cit> . furthermore, pa <dig> encodes an exonuclease, as is found in characterized phage recombinase pairs such as redαβ in λ and recet in rac <cit> . kl <dig> gp <dig> is most closely related to pa <dig> orf <dig> and, with 91% identity, is the kl <dig> protein most similar to a pa <dig> protein. in addition, kl <dig> gp <dig> has 65% identity with pa <dig> orf <dig> and both of these proteins are similar to λ redα  . it is interesting to note that, despite the relatively limited similarity between kl <dig> and other previously sequenced bcc-specific phages, both gp <dig> and gp <dig> are similar to proteins from burkholderia phage bcepgomr 
 <cit> . although further characterization of these proteins is required in both kl <dig> and bcepgomr, it is possible that these exonucleases and sak4-like recombinases represent a conserved recombination system in certain bcc-specific phages.

ah <dig> encodes dna replication, modification, and repair proteins including a putative dna polymerase iii β subunit , vsr endonuclease , excinuclease , restriction endonuclease/methylase pair , integrase , helicase , resolvase , dna polymerase , single-stranded dna binding protein , cas <dig> superfamily exonuclease , and primase  . other putative dna binding proteins are predicted to be involved in transcriptional regulation. gp <dig> is similar to partitioning and regulation proteins from thermus thermophilus  and e. coli  . the gp <dig> and gp <dig> predicted proteins belong to the helix-turn-helix merr superfamily and the pyocin activator superfamily, respectively. both of these proteins, in addition to gp <dig>  also show similarity to excisionase proteins . gp <dig> and gp <dig> are similar to the lysogeny control proteins ci from enterobacteria phage  <dig>  and cro from xylella fastidiosa ann- <dig> , respectively .

ah <dig> gp32-gp <dig> are predicted to be part of a dna protection and repair module. vsr  endonucleases are involved in the repair of 5-methylcytosine to thymine deamination
 <cit> . previously, we identified a vsr endonuclease in the bcc-specific phage kl <dig> that, along with an ecorii-c endonuclease/methylase pair, was predicted to be part of a novel non-self dna degradation and self dna protection/repair module
 <cit> . our model proposed that non-kl <dig> dna  would be degraded by the endonuclease , while kl <dig> dna would be protected by the methylase  . vsr endonuclease  and very short patch repair would then prevent the accumulation of mutations caused by 5-methylcytosine deamination
 <cit> .

the dna protection and repair system of ah <dig> is analogous to that of kl <dig>  ah <dig> gp <dig> has 51% identity with the kl <dig> vsr endonuclease and is similar to e. coli vsr endonuclease  . ah <dig> also encodes an endonuclease/methylase pair: gp <dig> is similar to kluyvera ascorbata kasi  while gp <dig> is similar to k. ascorbata m.kasi, brevundimonas diminuta atcc  <dig> cytosine-specific methyltransferase nlax, and acetobacter pomorum dm <dig> modification methylase hpaii . gp <dig> also has several methylase conserved domains, including dcm 
 <cit> . gp <dig> is similar to thermotoga maritima uvrabc system protein c  and could function together with uvrab in nucleotide excision repair 
 <cit> . although further experiments are required to identify the recognition sites of gp <dig> and gp <dig>  we predict that this module may function as follows: gp <dig> cleaves non-self dna, while self dna is protected by gp <dig> methylation and subsequent gp <dig> repair . although the identity and arrangement of genes in this module is different in ah <dig> than in kl <dig>  the identification of a similar module in an unrelated bcc-specific phage suggests that these genes may be widely used for dna protection and repair in this group of viruses.

mazg
a notable protein encoded by both kl <dig> and ah <dig> is mazg. mazg is a pyrophosphohydrolase that acts on ppgpp, one of the signaling molecules in bacteria produced during the stringent response
 <cit> . when bacterial cells are in an amino acid-limited environment, rela synthesizes pppgpp, the precursor of ppgpp, and the latter activates the expression of genes required for cell survival  and represses genes required for protein and dna synthesis . recently, there has been a great deal of interest in marine phages  that encode mazg homologs, such as prochlorococcus phages p-ssm <dig> and p-ssm <dig>  synechococcus phage s-pm <dig>  prochlorococcus and synechococcus phage syn <dig>  roseobacter phage sio <dig>  pseudoalteromonas phage h105/ <dig>  almost one-fifth of the cyanophages tested by bryan et al.
 <cit> , and all of the cyanophages analyzed by sullivan et al.
 <cit>  <cit> . it has been suggested that these mazg-encoding phages are better able to infect and propagate within their hosts, which are found in nutrient-limited water. by inactivating ppgpp, these phages can promote the expression of genes that would usually be expressed by an exponential phase cell under nutrient-rich conditions, such as those required for protein and dna synthesis
 <cit> . there are few published reports of the mazg gene in non-marine phages, but it has been previously identified in myxococcus phage mx <dig> and mycobacteriophage l5
 <cit> .

the putative mazg proteins encoded by kl <dig> and ah <dig> are gp <dig> and gp <dig>  respectively. kl <dig> gp <dig> is similar to putative mazg proteins from phages infecting synechococcus , prochlorococcus , and bacillus , as well as to pa <dig> hypothetical protein orf <dig> . ah <dig> gp <dig> is similar to putative clostridium mazg proteins and to the burkholderia phage proteins ϕe <dig> gp <dig>  bcepmu gp <dig>  and bcepb1a gp <dig>  both gp <dig> and gp <dig> are similar to e. coli mazg  . because bcc bacteria found in soil and water are likely to be nutrient-limited , mazg proteins in bcc-specific phages may help to facilitate infection in the environment. this protein may also be involved in the unique plaque phenotype of these phages, as the appearance of plaques at low titre after > <dig> h incubation   suggests that lysis of stationary phase cells may be occurring. such a trait would be especially important for clinical use, as phage activity may be increased against stationary and/or biofilm cells found in the cf lung.

mazg may also have an effect with respect to bcc pathogenicity. synthesis of ppgpp has been associated with virulence in species such as legionella, listeria, pseudomonas, salmonella, mycobacterium, and vibrio 
 <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, rela mutants are less virulent than the wildtype when tested in the drosophila melanogaster model
 <cit>  and rela spot mutants have reduced antibiotic tolerance
 <cit> . because mazg activity may mimic the effects of these mutations, it is possible that phage-encoded mazg could modulate the virulence and/or antibiotic tolerance of a lysogen. further experiments are required to determine if the putative kl <dig> and ah <dig> mazg proteins have pyrophosphohydrolase activity, if these genes are expressed in lysogens, and if mazg expression has an effect on pathogenicity.

convergent evolution
although there have been relatively few papers published on the subject, the occurrence of convergent evolution in bacteriophages has been documented previously. most studies examine the phenomenon at the molecular level by identifying identical base pair and amino acid changes that occur in different phage lineages under the same environmental conditions
 <cit> . structural examples of convergent evolution, such as the caudovirales tail and the tectivirus pseudo-tail, have been reviewed previously
 <cit> . given the ever-increasing number of completed phage genome sequences, it is expected that many more examples remain to be identified . furthermore, there are likely many examples in the literature of phages with similar phenotypes but dissimilar genomes that have not explicitly been identified as examples of convergent evolution, perhaps because they exhibit what is considered to be a “standard” plaque phenotype.

we predict that kl <dig> and ah <dig> represent examples of phage convergent evolution at the whole genome level. as discussed above, these two phages exhibit a plaque phenotype that is both similar and unique in comparison to all other bcc-specific phages that we have characterized previously. because of these characteristics, kl <dig> and ah <dig> were thought to be the same phage prior to rflp and genomic analysis. however, these phages appear to have convergently evolved because, as discussed throughout, their genomes are almost entirely dissimilar . the relative rarity of this phenotype among characterized phages of the bcc and other species may be at least partially explained by sampling bias. standard phage isolation protocols most readily identify those phages that have easily visible plaques on multiple hosts after overnight incubation at a broad range of temperatures. phages such as kl <dig> and ah <dig> may be missed because of poorly visible plaques, incompatible hosts, insufficient incubation times, incorrect temperatures, titres that are too high or too low, overgrowth of bacteria, and/or competition by more rapidly lysing phages. as novel phages continue to be isolated from environmental samples using diverse bacterial hosts, the prevalence, distribution, and genetic basis of this phenotype should become more apparent.

several mechanisms could explain the delayed plaque formation observed here, including long latent periods or lysis inhibition 
 <cit> , preferential infection of stationary phase cells, or the gradual release of diffusible lytic enzymes from small plaques. in order to differentiate these possibilities, we performed one-step growth curves for both phages using either exponential or stationary phase c <dig> as a host. using a variation of a standard protocol , the phage titres unexpectedly remained stable  over a  <dig> h period. given the uninformative nature of these results, we have thus far been unable to identify the mechanism responsible for the plaque phenotype. taking into consideration the very specific conditions required for the observation of kl <dig> or ah <dig> plaques on solid medium, we predict that the infection kinetics in liquid culture may be highly dependent upon host , incubation time, temperature, titre, and potentially other factors  that are not accounted for using standard one-step growth curve protocols.

CONCLUSIONS
a recent publication by ceyssens et al.
 <cit>  provides an interesting counterpoint to our study. while we identified kl <dig> and ah <dig> as phages that were phenotypically-similar but genomically-distinct, this group analyzed a set of pseudomonas phages that were phenotypically-distinct but genomically-similar. they found that, among ϕkmv-like viruses with between 83-97% nucleotide identity, there were significant differences observed with respect to latent period, host range, and antibody reactivity
 <cit> . we have made similar observations with our collection of bcc-specific phages: two phages can have distinct phenotypes with respect to liquid clearing and host range while at the same time having almost identical genomes
 <cit> . taken together, the observations made by ceyssens et al.
 <cit>  and those discussed in this study provide a) novel examples of both divergent and convergent phage evolution and b) further evidence of the broad diversity of phages that infect gram-negative opportunistic pathogens.
