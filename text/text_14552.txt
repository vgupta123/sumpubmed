BACKGROUND
sequencing of mrna transcripts using rna-seq protocol  <cit>  is becoming the reference method for detecting and quantifying genes expressed in a cell. although rna-seq technology is still in the early phase and it has not disclosed completely its potential, http://encodeproject.org/encode/protocols/datastandards/encode_rnaseq_standards_v <dig> .pdf, it can be used to discover genes created by chromosomal rearrangements. thus, this technology represents an ideal tool for the discovery of fusion genes, formed by breakage and re-joining of two different chromosomes, which are implicated in the development of cancer  <cit> . however, normal cells seem to be also characterized by intergenic splicing and transgenic splicing, namely chimera  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  intergenic splicing refers to a splicing event between two adjacent genes in the genome, while transgenic splicing is an event that produces a chimera comprising exons of two genes located on different chromosomes. chimeras on the basis of est estimations  <cit>  and more recently by rna-seq  <cit>  were observed in normal tissues. we refer to these approaches as ab-initio since the authors rely on genomic data, without additional biological support, to detect fusions. the experiments reported in  <cit>  indicate that at least 4-6% of genes in the genome may be involved in chimera formation, although their prevalence was found to be generally low. moreover, targeted alignment against artificial exon-exon junctions  <cit>  of single-end reads rna-seq data, allowed the detection of a significant amount of chimeras in normal colon and brain tissues as well as in primary colon tumors. no overlap could be observed between the results obtained with est and rna-seq based approaches  <cit> .

recently, frenkel-morgenstern et al.  <cit>  described a new approach to assess chimeras. we term this procedure as the knowledge-based approach since it is based on fusion events extracted from published data. the authors studied  <dig>  putative human chimeric rnas  <cit>  and detected the expression of  <dig> chimeric rnas in  <dig> human tissues  using high throughput rna sequencing, mass spectrometry experimental data, and functional annotations.

fusion finder algorithms
in the last two years many chimera-detection tools have been developed and published. to the best of our knowledge, chimerascan  <cit> , defuse  <cit> , fusionfinder  <cit> , fusionhunter  <cit> , fusionmap  <cit> , mapsplice  <cit> , shortfuse  <cit> , tophat-fusion  <cit>  are the most commonly used tools for chimera detection. chimerascan and shortfuse were not considered here since their run did not terminate properly during the preliminary testing phase. before describing fusion finder algorithms, we introduce the terms used in the rest of the paper.

rna-seq experiments provide a set of short reads that can be in two forms: single-end or paired-end. in the latter case both the forward and reverse template strands of dna fragment are sequenced. according to the identification of fusion boundary  it is possible to observe two contexts: read spanning or read encompassing. encompassing reads harbor a fusion boundary and each read maps on a different gene of the fused gene couple, while in spanning reads one mate overlaps with a fusion event, while the corresponding paired-end mate matches with one of the two genes involved in the chimera.

we have categorized the fusion detection algorithms into two classes: the fragment-based approach and the pseudo-reference based approach.

in the fragment based approach input reads are split into fragments, which are aligned with respect to reference . the mapped fragments are then used to build a list of putative chimeras that undergo through a further selection by means of various types of filters. this category includes the following tools: fusionfinder, fusionmap, mapslice, defuse. pseudo-reference based approaches use candidate chimeras, obtained from the previous mapping phase, to generate a new pseudo reference for chimeras detection. the fusion events resulting from the latter step are further filtered to reduce false positive. tophat-fusion and fusionhunter are the tools included in this category.

in this paper, we focus on fusion finder algorithms for ab-initio processes. between those algorithms, fusionmap has shown the best compromise between sensitivity and sensibility. its results have been also compared with results obtained by the knowledge-based approach presented in frenkel-morgenstern's paper.

RESULTS
evaluating the sensitivity of fusion-finder algorithms
to compare the sensitivity of fusion-finder algorithms we used a synthetic dataset provided as part of the release of the fusionmap software, and we used it as positive dataset.

this dataset encompasses a total of  <dig> chimeras, supported by a different coverage. in particular, the chimeras are characterized by a number of supporting paired-end reads ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the analysis of the positive dataset revealed that fusionfinder is the most sensitive tools. based on the sensitivity, the tools can be ordered as fusionfinder > tophat-fusion = fusionmap > mapsplice > defuse > fusionhunter as reported in table  <dig>  the table also reports the number of false chimeras detected by each tool, i.e. identification of fusion genes not present in the positive synthetic set. when ranked by the false discovery rate the order changes as follows: defuse = fusionhunter < fusionmap < fusionfinder < mapsplice < < tophat-fusion. fusionmap thus appears to provide the best compromise between sensitivity and false discovery rate.

in parenthesis are given the number of fusions

the sensitivity of each tool is given by the number of chimeras detected by each tool divided for the total number of chimeras in the positive dataset. false discovery rate is given as the total number of chimeras detected that do not match any of the positive  <dig> chimeras.

we have also evaluated the number of supporting reads detected by the six fusion finders on the positive dataset . all six tools detect a number of reads that are lower than the number present in the dataset . it is notable that defuse detects a number of reads near to expectation for fusions supported by more than  <dig> reads. also the other tools lose sensitivity in case of a low number of supporting reads, but they are also characterized by a lack of detection for fusion events supported by a high number of reads.

evaluating the false discovery rate of fusion finder tools
to better understand the detection of false fusion events we constructed a semi-synthetic paired-end dataset composed by  <dig> million  <dig> bps reads. the dataset was built using beers  <cit> . beers does not simulate quality scores, required by many fusion finder tools, thus we added scores obtained by experiments conducted in our laboratory, giving rise to two paired-end fastq datasets: lib100_ <dig>  and lib100_ <dig>  associated with two similar sets of quality scores . different quality score sets led to the evaluation of the effect of quality score on chimera detection. furthermore, four other datasets, two of  <dig> bp reads  and two of  <dig> bp reads , were generated from lib100_ <dig>  lib100_ <dig> , to evaluate the effect of read size on the detection of chimera false discovery. fusionfinder, fusionhunter, fusionmap, mapsplice, defuse, tophat-fusion were used to analyze the negative datasets. table  <dig> lists the number of false chimeras detected, while figure  <dig> shows read length and quality score dependency for genes involved in false fusions. fusionhunter was the only tool that did not detect false chimeras in any of the negative datasets . fusionmap and defuse showed a direct dependency of the number of false chimeras from the read length . fusionmap also showed a limited dependency of false chimera detection on the basis of quality scores associated with the reads . in comparison, fusionfinder showed an inverse dependency of false chimera detection from the read length  and a strong dependency of false chimera detection on the basis of the read quality scores . tophat-fusion detected the highest number of false chimeras, although its dependency with respect to read length and quality score was limited . the results of mapsplice appear to be correlated to the quality scores . according to the false discovery rate, tools can be ranked as: fusionhunter < < fusionmap < fusionfinder < defuse < < mapsplice < tophat-fusion. we also counted the number of reads associated to the false chimeras detected by only five out of six tools, since fusionhunter did not detect any false positive chimera. in the case of tophat-fusion and mapsplice the median of the supporting reads for false positive was one read for all negative datasets , but some false fusions were supported by a dozen to hundreds of reads . a similar scenario was found for defuse, with a median of the supporting reads for false positive in the order of  <dig> reads for all negative datasets analyzed . fusionmap and fusionfinder were also characterized by a median of  <dig> for false positive supporting reads , but in the worst situation false fusions were supported by less than  <dig> reads for fusionmap, in the lib <dig> negative dataset , and by less than  <dig> reads for fusionfinder .

*the analysis did not produce the results due to a software error occurring in the handling of an intermediate file.

number of chimeras detected in datasets free of fusion events . analysis is performed using different read lengths for the same negative dataset . in case of the  <dig> nts paired-end reads negative dataset reads were also analyzed considering two different sets of experimental quality scores .

searching for chimeras on real dataset with fusionmap
since fusionmap provided the best compromise between false and true fusions detection, we checked its performance on a real dataset: the body map  <dig> . we used the  <dig> bp paired-end dataset and we checked fusionmap results against those presented by frenkel-morgenstern  <cit>  on the body map  <dig>   <dig> bp single-end dataset. as positive controls we used a subset of the  <dig> fusion events reported by the authors. we checked these  <dig> fusion by blasting them with respect to the genome and we ensured that each chimera encompasses genomic regions with the following characteristics: i) genomic regions should not belong to the same gene, ii) each genomic region should not match on multiple chromosomes, iii) each region involved in the fusion should not match on more than two different chromosomal loci. unexpectedly, only  <dig> fusion genes, reported in table  <dig>  exhibit all three characteristics; these events represent the minimal set of positive chimeras, which are expected to be detected in real dataset obtained from normal tissues.

the subset of  <dig> chimeras encompassing only two genes on different chromosomes, extracted from the  <dig> events validated by frenkel-morgenstern, using the  <dig> nts single-end reads rna-seq body map  <dig>  dataset, was used as positive control of the ability of fusionmap to detect chimers in normal tissues rna-seq data.

the analysis performed with fusionmap detected hla-e  and ssp <dig>  as genes involved in fusions, also identified by frenkel-morgenstern  <cit> . however, the authors detected hla-e:gstp <dig> and ramp2:spp <dig> fusions, whereas in our analysis we detected hla-e:bckdhb and spp1:abca <dig> fusions. we also found other fusions , that are not part of the frenkel-morgenstern dataset.

number of genes detected as part of chimera in body map  <dig>   <dig> nts paired-end dataset. body map  <dig>   <dig> nts paired-end was generated from the same donors used for the  <dig> nts single-end dataset used in frenkel-morgenstern's paper to validate putative fusion by means of a knowledge-based approach. thus, the two datasets are technical replication of the same mrna universe.

discussion
the main goal of this paper was to understand if the main fusion detection software tools, available in the literature, are able to detect chimeras in normal tissue rna-seq data. to reach our aim, it was essential to understand the behavior of fusion detection software tools. thus, we evaluated the sensitivity and false discovery rate for six state-of-the-art fusion-finders: fusionhunter, fusionmap, fusionfinder, mapsplice, defuse and tophat-fusion.

in our experiments, fusionhunter performed better than all the other tools on the basis of false discovery rate, but had the lowest sensitivity with respect to the others. the behavior of fusionhunter is consistent with two other observations: i) fusionhunter looses all the fusions, in the positive dataset, supported by less than  <dig> reads, and ii) the median value for false positive chimeras for all tools, excluded fusionhunter, is between  <dig> to  <dig> reads. thus, to reduce the risk of false positive detection, weighting negatively fusions supported by a low number of reads, fusionhunter clearly suffers of a reduced sensitivity. at the same time fusionhunter implements some specific features that make it less sensitive to the discovery of false fusions supported by a high number of reads that are frequently observable in the other fusion detection tools.

quality scores associated with the datasets affected mapsplice and fusionfinder results. on the other hand, fusionfinder was more sensitive to read length, with a reduction in the false fusion detection rate dependent on a corresponding increase in the read length. conversely, fusionmap and defuse performed much better with short reads: the larger the read the higher the number of false positive fusion genes. tophat-fusion was insensitive to quality score, but it showed the highest false positive discovery rate of the tools tested. with respect to sensitivity, defuse and fusionhunter, were found to be the least sensitive. the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity was given by fusionmap, which seemed particularly suitable for the analysis of the illumina normal tissue body map  <dig>  rna-seq dataset, since its false fusion detection rate was particularly low in the analysis of negative datasets. despite the good sensitivity of fusionmap in the test dataset, the analysis of the body map  <dig>  paired-end reads revealed a low correlation between fusionmap fusions detected in this dataset and fusions detected in the single-end dataset by frenkel-morgenstern. an important point to be considered, when comparing the results obtained with the  <dig> bp reads single-end and the  <dig> bp reads paired-end body map  <dig>  datasets, is tissue source origin. the two datasets are generated starting, for each tissue, from the same donor, therefore we expect the results to be comparable. the lack of correspondence between true positive fusions, namely the  <dig> fusion events validated in the body map  <dig>  in frenkel-morgenstern paper and results obtained with fusionmap on the same dataset in this paper, suggests that ab-initio chimera detection approaches are not sensitive enough to detect fusion genes in normal tissues. however, since chimeras detected by frenkel-morgenstern have a quite low representation in normal tissues, it is also possible that they were not sampled in the paired-end dataset for stochastic reasons.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper highlights that specificity of state of the art tools for the identification of chimeras is affected at different degrees by read length and read quality scores of the rna-seq dataset under analysis. thus, it is important to carefully select the software on the basis of rna-seq data features. in the specific case of detection of chimeras in normal tissues these fusion finder tools do not seem to provide results consistent with those obtained with a knowledge-based approach such as those reported by frenkel-morgenstern  <cit> .
