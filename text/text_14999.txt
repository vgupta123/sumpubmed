BACKGROUND
in plants, transcriptional or post-transcriptional gene silencing is directed by genome-encoded 21â€“24-nt small rnas. these small rnas can be divided into two major classes: micrornas  and short-interfering rnas . mirnas function in post-transcriptional gene silencing by guiding mrna degradation or translational repression  <cit> . endogenous sirnas are further classified into two major groups predominantly based on the size and mode of gene regulation. the 21-nt size class sirnas represented by trans-acting sirnas  and others guide the cleavage of the target mrnas at the post-transcriptional level, whereas 24-nt size class sirnas are implicated in dna and histone modifications leading to transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> .

micrornas were first identified in caenorhabditis elegans through genetic screens for aberrant development  <cit>  and were later found in almost all multicellular eukaryotes examined. mature mirnas are single-stranded ~ <dig> nt small rnas which are generated from a single-stranded primary transcript  forming an imperfect hairpin-like structure, by a series of enzymatic activities of double-stranded rna recognizing rnase iii enzymes . the plant nuclear localized dicer-like  <dig>  enzyme processes pri-mirna into a mature mirna  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the hyponastic leaves  <dig>  another double stranded rna binding protein, together with serrate , a c2h <dig> zinc finger protein, co-operatively assists dcl <dig> in releasing the mirna and mirna* from the fold-back structure  <cit> . the released 21-nt duplex is stabilized by the addition of methyl groups to the 3'ends of the duplex and this step is catalyzed by the methyltransferase hen <dig>  <cit> . the methylated mirna-mirna* duplex is exported to the cytoplasm by hasty, the plant ortholog of exportin  <dig> and other yet unidentified exporters  <cit> . subsequently, the duplex is unwound and only the active strand which is referred to as mirna is loaded onto the rna-induced silencing complex . guided by mirnas, the risc recognizes the complementary sites on the target mrnas to cause transcript cleavage  <cit>  or translational arrest  <cit> .

in plants, ~ <dig> mirna families which are well conserved between dicots and monocots are known. of these,  <dig> mirna families, i.e., mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir165/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been also found in primitive land plants such as physcometrella and selaginella suggesting that these are deeply conserved  <cit> . in addition, arabidopsis, rice, populus and physcometrella possess many non-conserved lineage- or plant species-specific mirna families  <cit> .

recent advances in high-throughput sequencing methods have revolutionized the identification of low-abundance non-conserved mirnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . the application of sequencing technologies such as mpss and  <dig> resulted in finding  <dig> new mirnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, with enhanced sequencing depth  <dig> new mirnas were discovered in arabidopsis  <cit> . using a similar method coupled with the computational approach,  <dig> new mirnas were identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . most of these newly identified mirnas are not conserved in rice or populus suggesting that these may be specific to arabidopsis. non-conserved mirnas are thought to be the mirnas which are evolving or evolved recently and only some of them with functional significance will be retained and the remainder may be lost in a short time scale  <cit> .

the identification of a near complete set of small rnas in any organism is of fundamental importance to understanding small rna-mediated gene regulations and the diversity of small rnas. it lays the necessary foundation for unraveling the complex small rna-mediated regulatory networks controlling development, nutrient responses and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . rice  analyses will significantly advance our ability to unravel the small rna-guided circuitry in rice. thus far, computational and low-depth conventional sequencing of rice small rna libraries have been successful in identifying conserved mirnas, in addition to a few monocot-specific and rice-specific mirnas  <cit> . two recent studies reported large scale sequencing of small rnas in rice and some of these sequences likely new mirnas  <cit> , but their annotation as new mirnas has not been confirmed. here, we used deep sequencing of rice small rnas to identify novel mirnas and possibly stress-regulated mirnas. sequence analysis indicated that we have found  <dig> novel mirnas as well as  <dig> candidate mirnas in rice. six of these new mirnas  appear to be conserved in other monocots. northern analysis revealed that several of these new mirnas and candidate mirnas are abundantly expressed. we predicted  <dig> new targets for  <dig> of the newly found mirnas in rice. thus this study advances our understanding of mirnas in rice by discovering many new mirnas and their potential target genes.

RESULTS
mirna expression profiling in rice seedlings
in the present study, we carried out high-throughput sequencing of small rna libraries in order to identify low-abundance candidate new mirnas and potential stress-responsive mirnas in rice. four-week-old rice seedlings were either untreated  or treated with  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> hrs  or were dehydrated for  <dig> h . a small rna library was generated from each of the samples and sequenced at  <dig> life sciences. the obtained raw sequence reads  were processed computationally to remove the 5' and 3' adapter sequences and this yielded a total of  <dig>  genome matching reads from  <dig> libraries . the remaining sequences that could not mapped to the rice genome were discarded and possibly these sequences might contain sequence errors, affected by rna editing, or be derived from the unsequenced genomic regions or contaminants. after removing rrna, trna and sn/snorna, we obtained  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique small rnas that match perfectly with the rice genome from control, salt and drought libraries, respectively.

currently, mirbase lists  <dig> rice mirnas  that can be grouped into  <dig> mirna families. out of these,  <dig> mirna families  were only predicted based on sequence conservation between rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . thus far, these sequences were neither found in any of the deeply sequenced arabidopsis small rna libraries  <cit>  nor in rice  thus, as of today the count of expressed mirna families are set at  <dig> in rice. several of them are non-conserved rice-specific mirna families and their characterization as mirnas was solely based on predicted fold-back structures for flanking sequences of cloned sequences  <cit> . neverthelesss, the sequencing depth obtained in this study is sufficient to find  <dig> out of  <dig> expressed mirna families known in rice. previously reported seven mirna families are not represented in our sequences, possibly due to their extreme low abundance or tissue- or cell-specific expression patterns or other unknown reasons such as biased cloning.

new mirnas
defining new mirnas in rice is particularly challenging since a rice dcl <dig> knockout mutant is not available. rice dcl <dig> knock-down plants have been reported  <cit> , but the material was unavailable for our study. thus, our mirna classification in this study is based on the following criteria: 1) predicted fold-back structures for the precursors, 2) in several cases, occurrence of the small rna sequence in more than one independent library, 3) the presence of mir* sequence in atleast one of the libraries for several new mirnas, and 4) their conservation in related monocots, if any. most conserved mirnas exists as gene families and are therefore represented by multiple loci in arabidopsis, rice and populus whereas recently evolved/evolving mirnas are found to have a single locus in the genome  <cit> . in anology with these recent findings in arabidopsis, we designated the small rnas with a single locus in the rice genome as mirnas. however, a few outliers with upto  <dig> loci in the rice genome were also classified as mirnas in this study based on other considerations such as family members and their conservation in a related plant species. for instance, each of the three mir <dig> family members  can be mapped to more than one locus in the rice genome. another mirna, osa-mir <dig> with  <dig> hits in the rice genome has been considered as a mirna because this appears to be conserved in aegilops, a monocot. together, we have designated  <dig> small rnas obtained from  <dig> independent libraries as novel mirnas in rice by applying the above criteria . for all these  <dig> new mirnas, fold-back structures could be predicted using the flanking genomic sequences to the cloned small rnas .

origin and frequency of the new mirnas
in plants, most known mirnas are found in between the coding genes, although a few are found in sense or antisense orientations in introns and exons of protein-coding genes. to identify the locations of precursors on the rice genome, we used the tigr genbank database. of the  <dig> new mirnas listed in the table  <dig>  most can be mapped to intergenic regions, although five new mirnas  belonging to osa-mir <dig> family were found in the opposite strand of the protein coding genes. sixteen of these new mirnas can be mapped to single locus in rice genome . four mirnas  are mapped to  <dig> loci each, while  <dig> others  are mapped to  <dig> loci each in the rice genome. osa-mir <dig> could be mapped to  <dig> loci  and this has been included in the list of new mirnas, because we found mir <dig> homolog in aegilops, a monocot .

the mirna frequencies ranged between  <dig> to  <dig> reads in the control library. as expected, the top scoring sequences are conserved mirnas. compared to the conserved mirnas, all of the new mirnas were relatively low in abundance as indicated by their frequencies . four of the new mirnas  were found in all three libraries and  <dig> of the new mirnas  appeared at least in  <dig> of the  <dig> libraries. together,  <dig> of the new mirnas appeared at least in more than one independent library. three of the new mirnas appeared only once  in our sequences whereas the remaining  <dig> appeared multiple times. these findings suggest that a large number of mirnas may be unique to the rice genome, and possibly many more low abundance mirnas remain to be identified.

presence of mirna*
the multitude of other endogenous small rnas, some of which may originate from regions with a fortuitous potential to fold into mirna-like hairpin structures, has complicated mirna identification in plants, leading to the suggestion that biogenesis requirements be confirmed using mutants prior to annotation  <cit> . in the absence of expression analysis in dcl <dig> mutant, the detection of mirna* sequences is an important criterion, because it supports the release of mirna duplex from the predicted foldback structure  <cit> . at least  <dig> of our new mirna sequences  had their mir* sequences in our libraries.

some of the newly identified mirnas are conserved in closely related monocots
to determine whether any of these novel candidate mirnas are conserved among other plant species, we searched the nucleotide databases for homologs. this analysis indicated that  <dig> mirnas, namely, osa-mir <dig> and five members of the osa-mir <dig> family are conserved in several other monocots . hairpin structures can be predicted for the mirnas in these plant species using mirna surrounding sequences obtained from est databases . previously, we have reported the identification of two mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> in rice  <cit> . in both cases, only the processed precursor transcripts can form hairpin structures but not using the genomic loci  <cit> . in this study, we have found  <dig> new members  belonging to mir <dig> family . in all these cases, prediction of fold-back structures require the processed transcript but not for the genomic sequences surrounding the mirna sequences in rice . osa-mir444e and the previously reported mir <dig> sequences appears to be derived from one precursor with a shift of  <dig> nucleotides as indicated in figure 1e. interestingly, these  <dig> new members  are highly conserved in several monocotyledonous plants such as sorghum, maize, barley, wheat, switchgrass, sugarcane and brachypodium . it is worth mentioning here that although osa-mir444d sequence appeared to be very different when aligned with the mir <dig>  but both sequences show high complementarity with the one of the mads box factors . thus, we consider that osa-mir444d is another new member of mir <dig> family. taken together, the absence of these mirna sequences in arabidopsis and their presence in closely related monocots suggest that these  <dig> mirnas  are specific to monocots.

predicted targets of the new mirnas
the targets of conserved mirnas can be predicted with very high confidence, whereas in single-genome analysis only the more extensively paired interactions can be predicted with reasonable confidence  <cit> . in order to reduce the ratio of false positive predictions we used a very stringent criterion for target predictions, i.e., simple blast searches for antisense hits with not more than  <dig> mismatches  <cit> , although this method might miss some authentic targets. furthermore, we focused on finding target sites in coding regions since previous studies found that plant mirna target sites are predominantly located in orfs  <cit> . this resulted in prediction of  <dig> targets for  <dig> of the new mirnas . some of the interesting predicted target transcripts are mads-box transcription factors, zn-finger  family protein, ef-hand family proteins and a calmodulin-binding protein  and several pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. thus, the non-conserved mirna target genes encode a broad range of proteins . it is interesting to note that target validations for non-conserved mirnas in arabidopsis had not been very successful, unlike conserved mirna targets  <cit> . future experimental validation will determine how many of these predicted targets are genuinely targeted by mirnas in rice. for the remaining new mirnas, we were unable to identify any targets using the above criterion. it has been hypothesized that "young" mirnas, i.e. non-conserved and recently evolved mirnas, exist without actual targets  <cit> . it is also possible that the applied stringent criteria might have missed the prediction of potential target genes.

putative new mirnas
in addition to the new mirnas listed in the table  <dig>  we have identified another  <dig> small rnas as candidate mirnas . thus far, mir <dig>  a known conserved mirna could be mapped to the  <dig> loci in rice . the number of loci for each of these putative mirnas is highly varied  in the rice genome. in our list of  <dig> candidate mirnas, one of them  can be mapped to as many as  <dig> loci in rice. we were able to detect  <dig> of the candidate mirnas  using small rna blot analysis out of  <dig> tested. some of these sequences with a very high number of hits to the rice genome could be sirnas derived from repeat-rich regions that happen to have predicted fold-back structures. fold-back structures can be predicted for at least one-third of these loci for each of the putative mirnas. the fact that fold-back structures can be predicted for many loci suggests that some of these could be authentic loci for the mirna. regardless of whether or not these are derived from fold-back structures or dsrnas, some of these small rnas appeared several times in our libraries and some others with maximum number of loci  could be detected using small rna blot analysis, suggesting that these are processed and accumulate at detectable levels. future studies using rice dcl mutants will help resolve how many of these will be true mirnas. we also predicted  <dig> targets for  <dig> of the candidate mirnas in rice .

expression profiles of conserved mirna families in rice seedlings
even at relatively low sampling depths, many conserved mirnas were sequenced in rice small rna libraries indicating their greater abundance  <cit> . in agreement with this, the conserved mirnas make up the top  <dig> most abundant signatures in our sequence reads .

the obtained sequence count data for conserved mirnas in each of the libraries suggested that the depth of sequencing could be sufficient to support estimation of the expression levels of conserved mirnas between the conditions represented by the  <dig> libraries. qualitatively, we did not find any striking differences for conserved mirnas in terms of their presence or absence in the stress libraries, although some notable quantitative differences exist. the most abundant mirna family across the three libraries was mir <dig> . if the abundance of a single mirna family is calculated relative to the total number of mirnas, the mir <dig> family alone accounted for 43%, 37% and 38% of the total mirnas in the control, drought and salt stress libraries, respectively. similarly,  <dig> mirna families i.e., mir <dig> and mir <dig> families each of them accounted for 15% of the total mirnas in these  <dig> libraries.

different members in a mirna family may have diverged slightly from each other and may even target different sets of messenger rnas  <cit> . it is thus important to determine which variant is more abundantly expressed in a given tissue to determine their potential for target regulation. in arabidopsis, recently xie et al.  <cit> , have reported the expression of  <dig> mirna genes by sequencing several small rna libraries and by mapping transcription start sites for several loci  <cit> . to examine which of the mirna family members are more abundantly expressed in rice seedlings, we inspected the expression profile of known mirnas in untreated seedlings  based on their sequence frequencies. our approach is sequence based determination of abundance which allows us to verify which mirna locus within a mirna family is expressed in a given tissue. however, this is only possible if the different members differ at least in one-nt and are each represented by a single locus in the genome. the most abundantly expressed mirna family in rice seedlings is mir <dig> which is represented by  <dig> members corresponding to  <dig> loci in rice . the expression of four members of the rice mir <dig> family has been reported previously  <cit> . here, we found evidence for the expression of all  <dig> variants in rice and their frequencies were highly varied . five variants  are represented by single copy whereas the  <dig> other variants have multiple copies in the rice genome. interestingly  <dig> members  had similar frequencies , although, only mir169a and mir169e, are derived from a single locus whereas the other  <dig> members have multiple paralogous loci in the rice genome .

mir <dig> is the second most highly expressed mirna in rice seedlings as determined by the number of reads . mir <dig> is represented by  <dig> members  that slightly differ in their sequences. the  <dig> mir <dig> members are represented by  <dig> different loci in the rice genome, and all  <dig> members were found to be expressed. the two members corresponding to mir156a-j  and mir156l loci are almost equally represented in our sequences , whereas the third member  is also expressed but at  <dig> times lower level compared to the other  <dig> variants.

rice mir <dig> is represented by two members  that differ slightly in nucleotide sequence and arise from two separate loci. since each locus is distinguishable because of the mirna sequence variation it can be easily determined whether or not both loci are expressed in rice. sequence analysis indicated that only mir168a was expressed and represented by  <dig> reads in our library but none for mir168b . these findings are consistent with previous small scale sequencing of rice small rna libraries wherein the expression of mir168a but not mir168b was observed  <cit> . these results suggest that mir168a is abundantly expressed in rice seedlings and mir168b expression may be limited to specific cells or tissues or developmental stages that were not tested in this study. in rice, mir <dig> is represented by  <dig> variants with  <dig> loci. previously, we reported the expression of only one variant which has  <dig> paralogous loci  in rice  <cit> . interestingly, the mir396d, e variant appears to be a monocot-specific version. here we provide evidence for the expression of the other two variants although at lower levels compared to mir396d, e . osmir396d, e appeared  <dig> times in the seedling libraries whereas the other two members i.e., mir396a, b and mir396c were represented only by  <dig> and  <dig> times respectively . similarly, mir <dig> has two variants coming from six loci in rice and only mir164c differs from the remaining five loci . mir164c was represented by  <dig> reads and the other member by  <dig> reads. mir <dig> has  <dig> loci with  <dig> members and all were found to be expressed in rice but with varied frequencies. mir166i, j appeared only once whereas one other member appeared  <dig> times and the frequencies of the remaining members were between  <dig> and  <dig> reads .

we also found cases in which all variants of a mirna family were expressed at similar frequencies. for example, mir <dig> is represented by  <dig> family members and can be mapped to  <dig> loci in rice. all  <dig> members that differ in one nucleotide were found to be expressed at similar abundance . similarly two other mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig>  are represented by  <dig> members each, and were expressed at a similar abundance .

some of the conserved mirna family members were expressed at low levels in rice seedlings. mir <dig> is represented by two paralogous loci and expressed at a very low frequency. similarly, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are represented by one member each but represented by two loci in the rice genome. these two mirna families were found to be expressed at low levels. the lowest frequency was found in the case of mir <dig>  mir <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were represented by only a few of reads in these libraries . thus far, mir <dig> has only been predicted based on sequence conservation with arabidopsis  <cit>  and it's expression is unknown in rice. our sequence analysis indicated that mir <dig> is expressed in rice. these findings suggest that most of the members of conserved mirna families are expressed. furthermore, the expression profiles of different members/variants within a mirna family can be similar or very different in rice seedlings, depending on the specific family. among the known non-conserved rice mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> appeared  <dig> times or more, at least in one of the  <dig> libraries . thus our mirna profiling in rice seedlings revealed the expression of  <dig> mirna variants belonging to  <dig> mirna families .

expression analysis of new and candidate mirnas
new mirnas
the variation in the frequencies of the new and putative new mirnas among the  <dig> libraries may indicate possible regulation of these small rnas under stress . however, the observed differences for these non-conserved mirnas are rather small and thus it is difficult to conclude whether or not these mirnas are truly regulated by stress. to further characterize the expression  of some of the new as well as putative new mirnas, we performed northern blot analysis. five of the new mirnas  with single locus in rice genome could be detected using gel blot analysis out of eight mirnas tested . we also detected another two mirnas with more than one locus, i.e, osa-mir <dig> that has  <dig> loci and osa-mir <dig> that has  <dig> loci in the rice genome . the expression analysis also included osa-mir <dig>  a known mirna in rice. together, we were able to detect the expression of  <dig> of the new mirnas, out of  <dig> examined . a comparison between sequence read frequency in the libraries and the northern blot data revealed a rather complicated picture. for instance, osa-mir <dig> was represented by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads respectively in the control, drought and salt stress libraries , indicating that it might be down-regulated, specifically under drought stress. however, the northern analysis result is not in agreement with this assessment . despite the fact that our drought library was represented by least number of rice genome matching small rnas, osa-mir <dig> was represented by  <dig> reads in the drought stress library and  <dig> reads in the control library  suggesting that this mirna might be slightly induced under drought stress. however, northern analysis showed that its expression levels did not differ between the control and stress conditions .

candidate mirnas
similarly, we also performed expression analysis of the candidate new mirnas using small rna blot analysis . of the  <dig> putative new mirnas tested, we were able to detect signals for  <dig> of them  . a candidate mirna, cpmir <dig> appeared  <dig> times in the control library and  <dig> times in the salt-stressed library suggesting that this might be suppressed under stress conditions, but no detectable differences were found in gel blot analyses . three other candidate mirnas, dpmir <dig>  dpmir <dig> and spmir <dig>  were represented by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> reads, respectively, in the stressed-libraries but none from the control library. northern analysis indicated no differences between the control and stress treated seedlings . taken together, there did not seem to be a good correlation between the sequence reads data and northern blot results. the apparent discrepancy may simply be due to the unreliability of the sequence reads data because of insufficient number of reads. it is also possible that the northern analysis was not sensitive enough to reveal small differences. it has been suggested that cloning has greater sensitivity in terms of determination of mirna abundance  <cit> . notwithstanding this difficulty in determining the relative abundance of mirnas, our detection of specific ~ <dig> nt signals for some of the putative new mirnas demonstrates that they are at least genuine small rnas and not non-specific degradation products .

for most of the probes used in the northern analysis, we noted that in addition to the signal of expected size, we detected signals of larger sizes specifically in the salt stress samples. one representative blot with prominent larger signals is shown in figure 4b. the larger signals may correspond to mirna processing intermediates, suggesting that salt stress may affect the processing of the small rnas.

discussion
with the application of deep sequencing, we have identified mostly low-abundant new mirnas  <cit>  and putative new mirnas  <cit>  in rice. the identification of a large number of mirnas not previously reported in rice, at least  <dig> of which are conserved in monocots, suggests that there may be many more monocot-specific or rice-specific mirnas to be identified. it is evident that the identification of the complete mirna repertoire in rice will require a broader sampling of tissues and deeper sequencing. it is known that the inflorescence expresses more diverse mirnas in arabidopsis  <cit> . certainly, seedlings used in this study must be complemented with additional tissues such as inflorescence for further discovery of mirnas in rice. this, coupled with similar studies in related monocots will help establish how many of these currently rice-specific mirnas are conserved in other monocot species.

the number of deeply conserved mirna families in rice largely remains the same as in arabidopsis. however, rice appears to have evolved lineage-specific  mirnas because of functional diversification between monocots and dicots. using deep sequencing of small rna libraries, we provided evidence for the expression of  <dig> mirna variants belonging to  <dig> mirna families as well as  <dig> new mirnas and  <dig> putative new mirnas. the nonconserved plant mirnas presumably emerge and dissipate in short evolutionary time scales  <cit> . as proposed for arabidopsis  <cit> , high-throughput sequencing of small rnas from species closely related to rice would help define the life span of the non-conserved mirna genes.

the number of times each mirna is represented in a small rna library could serve as an index for the estimation of their relative abundance. the frequency of mirna families in rice in our control library varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> times  indicating that the expression varies highly among different mirna families in rice seedlings. the very high abundance of mir <dig> in rice seedlings is also in agreement with the data from a small rna library generated using wheat seedlings  <cit> .

forty of the putative new mirnas can each be mapped to between  <dig> to  <dig> loci . at least some of these sequences could be potential mirnas derived from novel repeat sequences that adopts hairpin structures. in animals, a large body of emerging evidence supports the view that some mirnas are derived from repeat-rich regions. for instance,  <dig> mammalian mirnas, including  <dig> human mirnas have been shown to be derived from transposable elements  <cit> . in another report, it was confirmed that  <dig> human mirnas reside within repetitive  elements  <cit> . yet another recent report indicated that  <dig> mirnas each in humans and mouse are likely derived from repeats  <cit> . interestingly, mouse repeat-clustered mirnas have more than  <dig> genomic loci that are interspersed in the mouse genome. furthermore, it was estimated that the mirnas derived from repeats accounted for 23% of mirna genes, although the cloning frequency was represented by only  <dig> % of the total mirna sequences  <cit> . a very low cloning frequency of these mirnas suggests that they are low abundance mirnas. similarly, a human mirna family  was found to be derived from made  <dig> elements   <cit> . interestingly, made  <dig> derived hsa-mir- <dig> mirnas are generated from both strands of the transposable elements, as transcripts from both the strands were able to adopt hairpin like structures  <cit> . hsa-mir- <dig> family members can be mapped to between  <dig> to  <dig> loci in the human genome. our observation that some of the putative mirnas can be mapped to many loci with predicted fold-back structures raises the possibility that some of these could be authentic loci for mirnas in rice.

many conserved mirna families target transcription factors but most non-conserved mirnas likely target diverse genes that function in a broad range of biological processes. in an earlier study, we have reported that mir <dig> and it's target genes  are conserved in monocots such as wheat, barley, maize, sorghum and sugarcane but not in arabidopsis  <cit> . identification of  <dig> new members  that are highly homologous with mir <dig> indicated that mir <dig> and their conserved mads box factor genes as targets of this mirna family is interesting. these observations suggest that the  <dig> mads box factors may have been regulated by different members of mir <dig> family in monocots. furture studies focusing on functional analysis of these regulations by disrupting the mirna-targeted site in these mads box factors would reveal the role of these interactions in monocots. interestingly, mir <dig> target sequences were found in mads-box transcription factor genes in grape and soybean. mir <dig> does not seem to be present in soybean , it is not known whether or not mir <dig> homolog is present in grapes. these observations raises two possibilities;  monocots may have retained mir <dig> which regulates mads box factors while dicots have lost after the divergence,  mir <dig> may have evolved in monocots after the divergence. besides the mads box factor, we predicted c3hc <dig> family protein as a target for ceratin members of this mirna family.

pentatricopeptide repeat genes form a large family and are implicated in post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, editing, processing and translation specifically in organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit> . mutations in ppr genes result in a wide range of phenotypes including cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ppr transcripts are found to be targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>   <cit> . recently, it was shown that mirna targeted pprs in arabidopsis will give rise to phased sirnas  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> in populus are also targeting ppr transcripts  <cit> . the ppr targeting mirnas in arabidopsis and populus are unrelated and this led to the hypothesis that mirnas that target ppr genes appear to be independently evolved in arabidopsis and rice. similarly, we have predicted that osa-mir <dig> is targeting ppr transcripts in rice  and osa-mir <dig> is not related to any of the mirnas that are targeting ppr transcripts in arabidopsis and populus and raises the possibility that the osa-mir <dig> is a rice-specific mirna that has evolved to suppress the ppr transcripts.

four genes  involved in calcium signaling are potential targets of  <dig> mirnas . ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger and triggers physiological changes in response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . the prediction that  <dig> components of ca2+ signal transduction are potential targets of  <dig> new mirnas suggests a role for mirnas in calcium signaling, one of the major signaling mechanisms implicated in diverse physiological processes in plants  <cit> . identification of these predicted targets that are implicated in diverse biological processes expands the breadth of processes and pathways that are under mirna regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides an important glimpse of small rna abundance and diversity in rice. our deep sequencing led to the identification of monocot-specific and rice-specific new mirnas as well as candidate rice-specific mirnas. additionally, the expression of  <dig> mirna variants belonging to  <dig> mirna families was confirmed. recently, johnson et al.,  <cit>  and nobuta et al.,  <cit>  found a large number of small rnas in rice, suggesting extensive and complex regulatory roles of small rnas in this plant. our identification of new mirnas and their predicted target genes adds to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating cellular function, and their evolution.
