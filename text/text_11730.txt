BACKGROUND
schistosomes are dioecious metazoan parasites of the phylum platyhelminthes, which are estimated to infect more than  <dig> million people worldwide, with a further  <dig> million individuals living in the tropics and sub-tropics at risk of infection. the deposition of schistosome eggs within host tissues and the subsequent immune response elicited are the principal causes of chronic schistosomiasis, which can lead to a range of morbidities such as periportal fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation  <cit> . despite the availability of a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent , recent reassessment of disease-related morbidity shows schistosomiasis to be a far greater public health problem than previously estimated  <cit> . this reappraisal of the impact of schistosomiasis and the potential emergence of praziquantel-resistant strains argues strongly for the identification and characterisation of novel vaccine and drug targets.

schistosoma mansoni is one of three schistosome species that cause the vast majority of human infections and is the most extensively studied in the laboratory. large-scale sequencing projects have created extensive s. mansoni expressed sequence tag  and genomic databases leading to the identification of thousands of new genes, as well as providing a repository of information useful for post-genomic activities  <cit> . in our search for novel chemotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic targets, we have utilised these sequence databases for construction of dna microarrays to identify gender-associated and developmentally-regulated s. mansoni transcripts  <cit> . one interesting finding from these investigations was the identification of two adult male-associated transcripts bearing sequence similarity to the scp/tpx-1/ag 5/pr-1/sc <dig>  family.

members of the scp/taps family  encode structurally related proteins found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. all members contain a unique scp/taps protein domain, which varies in length between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids. tertiary structural studies have demonstrated that this domain adopts a highly conserved α-β-α sandwich conformation  <cit> . the strong conservation of the tertiary structure and of particular residues within the domain have suggested that all scp/taps domain containing proteins share a common biological activity  <cit> . however, no specific function has yet been ascribed to the scp/taps domain, despite some biological roles having been linked to member proteins within the superfamily. specifically, superfamily members have been linked to diverse processes including immune responses  <cit> , testis/sperm development  <cit> , envenomation  <cit>  and parasitic nematode invasion of definitive hosts  <cit> .

collectively these data suggest that scp/taps proteins participate in various biological activities across phyla and, as such, warrant further study in the platyhelminthes as potential modulators of immune function, components of sexual development and candidates for novel vaccine strategies. towards this end, we present the molecular characterisation of  <dig> scp/taps family members in s. mansoni, hereafter referred to as schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like 1– <dig> . we additionally describe a further  <dig> members of the smval family predicted in the most recent s. mansoni genome assembly  <cit>  and confirm the transcription of eleven of these. our comparison of the  <dig> genes provides evidence for the partitioning of the smval family into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis, genomic structure comparison and specific protein feature inclusion. furthermore, examples of both group  <dig> and group  <dig> scp/taps protein types are identified in several metazoan species, supporting an evolutionarily conserved superfamily division across phyla. analysis of smval1- <dig> transcription across the schistosome lifecycle demonstrates a range of distinct expression patterns, with a subset exhibiting transcription tightly associated with the invasive stages of the parasite. the proposed functional role of individual smval family members in host/parasite interactions and parasite-specific activities is discussed.

RESULTS
cdna cloning and identification of smval family members
to identify s. mansoni scp/taps domain-containing family members, the vespula vulgaris wasp venom allergen  <dig>  protein sequence was used in a tblastn search of s. mansoni ests and phat  <cit>  predicted genes from version  <dig> of the publicly available s. mansoni genomic database  <cit> . thirteen different members with significant sequence similarity to ves v  <dig> were identified, twelve originating from est contigs and one from a phat predicted gene. after pcr confirmation of the sequences from parasite-derived cdna, these transcripts were named schistosoma mansoni venom allergen-like transcripts . the molecular details of these thirteen sequences are shown in table  <dig>  the available hidden-markov model  consensus of the scp/taps domain  was subsequently used in a search of the most recent release of the genomic database . this identified  <dig> additional family members with complete scp/taps domains, and a further  <dig> with incomplete scp/taps domains. the molecular details of these sequences are shown in table  <dig>

complete open-reading frames  for smval1- <dig> were predicted by inspection of genomic sequence data, and these representative members  were confirmed by pcr amplification from parasite-derived cdna. additional full-length mrna sequences for smval <dig> , smval <dig> , smval <dig> , smval <dig> , smval <dig>  and smval <dig>  were obtained by rapid amplification of cdna ends  and these amplicons all contained the confirmed orfs as well as associated 5' and 3' untranslated regions .

complete orfs for smval14- <dig> were not physically obtained, although partial cdnas for a subset  were identified during reverse-transcription pcr of schistosome cdna to demonstrate they were indeed expressed. subsequent bioinformatics analysis presented herein for smval14- <dig> is based on the predicted full length orf obtained from s. mansoni genedb .

protein domain prediction using the smart database  <cit>  identified a single scp/taps domain  in all but one smval transcript, with smval <dig> containing two. no other smart predicted protein domains were identified in any of the smval proteins. the scp/taps domains ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> aa in length and typically comprised about 60% of the total amino-acid sequence of an individual smval. smval <dig> is an exception, as it contained a large extension  c-terminal to the scp/taps domain.

prediction of hydrophobic signal peptide sequences using the signalp program  <cit>  identified twenty-one smvals with strong evidence for signal peptides , two smvals  encoding possible signal peptides  and five smvals  showing no evidence of putative signal peptides  .

comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of smvals
alignment of the amino acid sequences encoded by smval1- <dig> revealed significant similarity only over the putative scp/taps domains . here, seven residues were found to be invariant among the smval family members . the smart-derived consensus sequence  for scp/taps domains indicates five of these seven invariant residues are conserved across phyla  and the other two are moderately conserved . the amino acids  present at the positions of the four residues proposed in structural studies to be the scp/taps domain putative active site  are shown. these putative active site residues show low levels of conservation within the smval family with only smval <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> containing all four residues. sequence identity over the smval scp/taps domain averages around 34% identity and ranges from very similar  to weakly related .

the multiple sequence alignment also indicated that the smval family could be divided into two groups based on features contained within the scp/taps domain. the first feature is the conservation of one deletion  and one insertion  in smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig>  the second feature is the absolute conservation of six cysteine residues  in twenty-three smval encoded proteins, which are absent from smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig>  together with signal peptide presence/absence, these data support the partitioning of smvals into  <dig> distinct sub-groups : group  <dig>  which harbour a signal peptide, contain conserved cysteine residues and lack the d <dig> and i <dig> primary amino acid elements and group  <dig> , which lack a signal peptide, lack the  <dig> conserved cysteine residues but contain the i <dig> and d <dig> regions.

phylogenetic analysis of scp/taps proteins
to investigate the phylogenetic relationship within the smval family, the predicted  <dig> complete scp/taps domains were used to construct a phylogram using bayesian analysis of a conserved   <dig> amino acid region  identified by gblocks  <cit>  . the derived phylogram contained two main smval clades  – one harbouring the six scp/taps domains from the group  <dig> smvals and the other containing the  <dig> scp/taps domains from the group  <dig> smvals . these two clades are also well-supported  in the consensus phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining algorithm . phylogenetic analyses of this type have also been performed for scp/taps domain- containing proteins within drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and clearly demonstrate that distinct group 1/ <dig> sub-divisions exist within scp/taps family members of other species.

the presence of two distinct groups of scp/taps domains within both s. mansoni and d. melanogaster led us to question whether this relationship was conserved across diversely related phyla. to study this split further, fourteen representative scp/taps family members from species within platyhelminthes, nematoda, arthropoda, gastropoda and chordata were used for extended phylogenetic analysis . the derived phylogram again contains two main clades , with the representative smval group  <dig> member  and the representative d. melanogaster group  <dig> member  found in one clade whereas the group  <dig> representatives of these species are clustered in the other clade . an additional larger analysis examining scp/taps family members from  <dig>  eukaryotic genomes using different phylogenetic methods demonstrated the wide-scale presence and independent segregation of group  <dig> and group  <dig> proteins throughout the metazoan subkingdom  and further supported this observation.

homology modelling of smvals
to explore the tertiary structural characteristics within the scp/taps domain of the smval family, we created homology models of the sequence verified smval1- <dig> members using modeller  <cit>  . two templates, necator americanus na-asp  <dig>  and l. esculentum p14a  were used to model the group  <dig> smval scp/taps domains , and one template, homo sapiens gapr- <dig>  was used to model the group  <dig> smval scp/taps domain . importantly, these derived models suggested that all smval scp/taps domains will adopt the α-β-α sandwich conformation common to all superfamily members across phyla. secondly, these models demonstrated that the six conserved cysteine residues within the group  <dig> smvals are capable of forming three disulphide bonds . thirdly, these models illustrated that the smval group 2-specific insertion and deletion domains are both found in the loop regions between the α-β-α secondary structural elements . finally, homology model surface analysis demonstrated that both smval <dig> and smval <dig> scp/taps domains possess the large cleft proposed to contain the active site  <cit>  . within the cleft, the smval <dig> model  contains three of the four putative active site residues , with the first glutamic acid of the active site being substituted by a glutamine . in the smval <dig> model, all four proposed active site residues  are present on the surface within the cleft . in both models, these four residues are found occupying a similar orientation to orthologous residues identified in previous crystallization studies of scp/taps family members  <cit> .

smval gene characteristics
smval1- <dig> genomic sequences were obtained from the s. mansoni genome database  <cit>  by comparing the laboratory derived cdna sequences to the assembled genomic sequences . to verify the current assembly, complete genomic sequences for smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> and partial genomic sequences for smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval8- <dig> were obtained by pcr amplification of s. mansoni genomic dna. when compared, these laboratory-derived sequences confirmed the assembled genomic sequences for each smval gene from s. mansoni genedb. the gene sizes of smval1- <dig> ranged from  <dig> bp  to ~ <dig> kbp  . the gene structures of the smval family members were investigated by aligning the cdna sequences with the gene sequences from the genomic database. with three exceptions, all exon/intron junctions conformed to the consensus  splice donor/acceptor sequences for eukaryotes. exon  <dig> of smval <dig> and exon  <dig> of smval <dig> use a 5' gc splice donor, and in exon  <dig> of smval <dig> the splice donor has been replaced by ac. given that cdna sequences of smval <dig> and smval <dig> are found to be spliced at these locations, these divergent splice sites appear to be functional.

as with the group 1/group  <dig> split in conserved cysteines, signal-peptide predictions and phylogenetic tree, the group  <dig> smvals differed from the group  <dig> smvals in gene structure . all group  <dig> smval genes possess five exons interrupted by four introns . the positioning and phase of each of the four introns in relation to the coding sequence of the genes was common to all . the group  <dig> smval genes varied in the number of exons, but within the coding region for the scp/taps domain, two intron positions and their phases were conserved throughout all members .

despite the conserved intron/exon structure  comprising the scp/taps domain of smval <dig>  the intron/exon structure coding for the c-terminus of smval <dig> is notable in its complexity. unlike all other family members, the large and extended genomic dna  region 3' of the scp/taps domain is composed of numerous small exons. in total, the gene encoding the smval <dig>  <dig> bp transcript is comprised of  <dig> exons, with  <dig> smaller than  <dig> bp .

smval genomic clusters
version  <dig> of the s. mansoni genomic assembly predicted several smval gene clusters to be spatially linked to distinct chromosomal regions . to experimentally verify the existence of these distinct smval gene clusters, bac clones spanning the genome assembly were sought for independent analysis. one bac clone, sm1-41j <dig>  was subsequently identified and pcr analysis of its dna sequence confirmed that the smval2/smval8/smval <dig> gene cluster was indeed present . subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridisation  localized sm1-41j <dig>  to the long arm of chromosome  <dig> and the short arm of chromosome w .

developmental expression of smvals
lifecycle expression profiles of the sequence-verified smval family members  were obtained by real-time rt-pcr using cdna created from the mrna of selected s. mansoni life-stages . here, distinct examples of normalised smval gene expression throughout the lifecycle were revealed including those displaying either developmental or ubiquitous patterns. one developmentally regulated pattern of smval transcription associated with invasion of the definitive host was found for genes encoding smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig>  specifically, smval <dig> expression was minimal in all stages examined except mother sporocyst and cercaria, with expression levels estimated to be 15-fold higher in cercaria compared to mother sporocyst. smval <dig> and smval <dig> also displayed peak expression in stages associated with vertebrate invasion  although other life stages show minimal expression.

the real time pcr results also revealed a second pattern of developmental regulation with smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> showing expression associated with the invasion of the intermediate host. specifically, smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> transcription was restricted to egg, miracidia and sporocyst life stages, with the miracidial stage showing an expression peak for all four gene products. a third type of developmentally regulated transcriptional profile was observed for smval <dig> and smval <dig> mrnas. here, both genes were up-regulated during worm maturation with peak levels of transcription occurring in the 5-week worm. finally, transcription of smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> appeared to be far less restricted, with measurable levels of mrna found in most life stages examined. smval <dig> and smval <dig> were minimally transcribed in the egg, miracidial and mother sporocyst stages, dramatically up-regulated in the cercaria and intermediately expressed in all subsequent somule/worm samples. ubiquitous  transcription for smval <dig> and smval <dig> are seen in all parasite samples with expression peaks observed in the miracidial  and adult female worm  life stages.

developmentally regulated alternative splicing of smval6
in the process of cloning smval <dig>  and likely due to its genomic complexity , many different individual full-length orfs were identified. interestingly, all sequence variability was limited to the region c-terminal to the scp/taps domain. we used primers  designed to amplify this specific region, both to further examine the level of smval <dig> variation and to compare the diversity of smval <dig> products expressed in different developmental stages. analysis of restriction digests from smval <dig> pcr amplicons throughout the life cycle showed that the greatest qualitative differences in rflp  patterns existed between cercarial and 7-week adult worms . therefore, clones derived from cercarial and adult 7-week mixed-sex cdna were subsequently isolated and sequenced. analysis of the randomly-selected clones,  <dig> from 7-week adult worm samples and  <dig> from cercarial samples, showed that the smval <dig> transcript is highly variable in both developmental stages . from the  <dig> clones sequenced,  <dig> separate isoforms were observed . the variation observed was found to be due either to the absence/presence of exons or alternative 3' splicing within an exon with none of the single nucleotide polymorphisms detected shared by more than one clone. no isoform was predominant; the most abundant isoform accounting for only  <dig> clones . to represent the different isoforms identified in this study, each exon found in the smval <dig> gene was numbered  and each isoform was scored for the presence or absence of each exon . using the χ <dig> test, statistically significant developmental regulation of exon expression was found for two exons –  <dig>  and  <dig>  . interestingly, these two exons were found specifically associated with smval <dig> transcripts expressed by the adult 7-week life stage and encode very similar amino acid pentamers  .

discussion
critical to the development of novel schistosome intervention strategies is the identification of exploitable parasite gene products that functionally participate in important biological niches such as host invasion, chronic host/parasite interactions or immunomodulation. with the availability of genomic information to support the use of transcriptomic and proteomic tools  <cit> , the discovery of exploitable schistosome gene products can now proceed at a previously unattainable rate. we have capitalised on this wealth of information to lead a study culminating in the molecular description of twenty-eight s. mansoni scp/taps family members, designated smval1- <dig>  while the exact function of each smval family member is currently unknown, the information provided in our study suggests potential roles in larval penetration, host immune response modulation and adult worm development.

one of the most striking observations in this study, mirroring a recent drosophila melanogaster investigation  <cit> , was the clear segregation of the smval superfamily into two distinct phylogenetic groups . importantly, we now show this segregation was not solely limited to the arthropoda and platyhelminthes, as additional phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the group 1/group  <dig> partition to be particularly well conserved and present in other phyla including nematoda and chordata . smval amino acid features  also segregated well into the group 1/group  <dig> partition and further strengthened the phylogenetic predictions. evidence to support that these group-specific amino acid features may impart distinct smval tertiary structural characteristics originates from the solved crystal structures of both group  <dig>  <cit>  and group  <dig>  <cit>  members. although similar α-β-α core scp/taps domains can be formed, the domains found in the group  <dig> proteins are stabilised by disulphide bonds , whereas the domains formed in group  <dig> proteins do not need these structural features. disulfide bonds are frequently found in extracellular proteins, but only rarely in intracellular proteins. therefore, the structural differences found in group  <dig> and group  <dig> proteins are in accordance with different localisations/fates for the group 1/group  <dig> scp/taps domain containing proteins. this contention is supported by localization studies involving several scp/taps domain-containing proteins. golgi-associated pr- <dig> protein, gapr- <dig>  demonstrated intracellular association with golgi membranes  <cit>  whereas tex <dig>  allurin and ac-asp  <dig>  are detected in extracellular locations  <cit> . therefore, irrespective of the function, one potential advantage of encoding two distinct scp/taps domains within the same organism is the ability to have one protein type specialised for the extracellular environment  and another type specialised for functioning intracellularly. indeed, diversification of this kind has recently been reported for the annelid globin gene family  <cit> .

comparison of the group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  scp/taps domain homology models showed similar overall structures except for subtle differences in two of the loop regions . both proteins also contain the large cleft  which is thought to be the location of the scp/taps domain active site  <cit> . four of the amino acids  present within the cleft have been proposed to form an active site of undefined activity due to their location, surface accessibility and evolutionary conservation  <cit> . interestingly, all group  <dig> smval proteins except smval <dig> contain all four residues  within this surface cleft  while none of the group  <dig> smval proteins contain all four residues  within this cleft . this suggests that any potential activity  across the family could be variable and therefore, diverse functions within the smvals would be substantial.

smval group-specific differences are also observed in the expression of gene products during the parasite's life cycle . the real-time pcr analysis of smval1- <dig> showed that many group  <dig> genes displayed developmentally-regulated expression patterns while all examined group  <dig> genes demonstrated far less restricted transcription profiles. group  <dig> members smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> all share a similar expression pattern with transcription peaking in miracidia, suggesting roles for these gene products in the free-living stage or in intermediate host invasion. the minimal presence of these transcripts in the egg stage may be due to our use of both immature & mature  egg material. however, recent proteomic studies of s. mansoni egg secretions have detected all four of these smvals, suggesting a potential secondary role in the egg  <cit> . the role of smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> secretion from unhatched eggs is currently being addressed as part of ongoing experiments into the protein secretion and localisation of smvals.

unlike smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig>  the developmental expression profiles of group  <dig> members smval <dig>  smval <dig>  and smval <dig> are linked to definitive host invasion – smval <dig> to the cercarial stage; smval <dig> and smval <dig> to both cercariae and 3-hour schistosomula . the smval <dig> and smval <dig> transcriptional results are corroborated by proteomic studies showing that these gene products  are indeed present in s. mansoni schistosomule secretions  <cit>  further supporting a role in definitive host invasion. overall, the presence of smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> proteins in secreted samples supports the signal peptide predictions for these proteins and, on a more general level, suggests that many or all of the smval group  <dig> proteins are released from the schistosome and capable of interacting with their immediate environment.

release of group  <dig> scp/taps proteins during parasitism may not be limited to the trematodes as ancylostoma caninum -asp 1- <dig>  haemonchus contortus - <dig> &  <dig>  ancylostoma ceylanicum -nif and ac-hpi are also secreted during nematode infective processes  <cit> . given the biological activities of the hookworm proteins ay-nif  and ac-hpi , it is tempting to speculate that some secreted group  <dig> smvals may have similar immunomodulatory roles acting, like nif and hpi, via interactions with integrins. other potential functions for group  <dig> smvals that may confer selective advantages during parasite invasion may relate to protease activity  or protease inhibition   <cit> . studies are ongoing to ascertain smval group  <dig> specific functions.

while all secreted group  <dig> smvals may indeed participate in host/parasite interactions, there is also evidence suggesting that smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig>  may be targets of the adaptive immune response. for example, the hymenopteran venom component ves v <dig> is a specific scp/taps allergen capable of activating basophils via an ige dependent mechanism in sensitised patients  <cit> . furthermore, human ige reactivity against the hookworm asp- <dig> protein  is positively associated with light hookworm infections in heavily exposed endemic populations  <cit> . this data, as well as successful vaccine experiments in animal models  <cit> , has led to asp- <dig> becoming a major human hookworm vaccine candidate  <cit> . together, these observations suggest that secreted group  <dig> smvals  may be specifically recognised by protective, anti-schistosome immune responses  <cit>  and imply that smval <dig>  smval <dig>  smval <dig> and smval <dig> proteins are potential s. mansoni vaccine candidates.

although we report the identification of twenty-eight scp/taps family members in this study, the complete number of smval genes will be unknown until the final genome build is released. preliminary evidence that one of the seven incomplete scp/taps genes  is transcribed  does suggest more smval  genes will be identified as the genome assembly progresses. the completion of the genome will also help in solving questions relating to smval gene duplication events. during the sequencing of both cdna and gdna, we have identified two different smval <dig> transcripts, two different smval <dig> genomic sequences and evidence for at least four variations of the smval3/smval <dig> family . the fish localisation of the smval2/smval8/smval <dig> bac clone to more than two chromosomal regions  also seems to provide evidence for duplications events, although recent reports of non-specific bac clone hybridization to the short arm of chromosome w have been reported  <cit> . additionally, within the twenty-eight smvals, there are several that display such striking sequence conservation that a recent gene duplication event is the most likely explanation. for example, genes encoding smval <dig> and smval <dig>  are 90% identical over encoded amino acid sequences  and 93% identical over complete genomic sequences. this high level of identity over both exons and introns, suggests such genes have been through recent gene duplication events and supports the contention that the smval family was expanded from two ancestral genes containing group-specific intron/exon structures .

in the absence of biological functions for the smval family, it is currently unknown why gene duplications have persisted. however, arguments can be made for all three of the main evolutionary conditions for copy retention – beneficial increased production, subfunctionalisation or neofunctionalisation  <cit> . the extra amount of an smval gene product gained by two gene copies could be advantageous despite functional redundancy between the two proteins. this has been suggested for gene copies of s. mansoni cercarial elastases, which all appear to encode proteins of the same substrate specificity  <cit> . subfunctionalisation describes a scenario where a protein encoded by the ancestral gene either has two biological functions or is expressed in two separate locations . after the duplication event, each copy can then specialise in a unique function or in a distinct location. neofunctionalisation describes a situation where one gene retains the original function while the other evolves a new function. both subfunctionalisation and neofunctionalisation could explain at least one smval gene duplication event, that of the ancestral smval1/smval <dig> gene. smval <dig> and smval <dig> are very similar genes  but have radically different expression profiles  with smval <dig> associated with vertebrate invasion and smval <dig> associated with invertebrate invasion. one hypothesis is that the ancestral smval1/smval <dig> gene was expressed both in the cercaria and the miracidia, and carried out the same function during both invasive processes. after the duplication event smval <dig> expression became restricted to cercaria and smval <dig> became specialised for the miracidial function. alternatively, the smval1/smval <dig> ancestral gene may have been expressed in only one invasive stage and gene duplication led to one gene gaining a new function  in the other invasive stage. further work will be needed to dissect the exact mechanism responsible for smval genomic expansion.

previous results utilizing dna microarrays demonstrated smval <dig> and smval <dig> to be male-associated in the adult worm  <cit> . the quantitative pcr assays reported here confirmed this finding with transcript levels 36-fold  and 3-fold higher  in adult males compared to adult females. quantitative pcr also showed an adult female-biased expression for smval <dig> mrna . interestingly, several scp/taps proteins in other species are also gender-associated. these include the mammalian crisp- <dig> and crisp- <dig> proteins, which are localised to the developing sperm and the xenopus allurin protein, which is associated with the egg  <cit> . semi-quantitative reverse transcription pcr of the drosophila scp/taps family members also showed that the majority of the transcripts to be gender-associated with 18/ <dig> showing male-associated expression and only one exhibiting female-associated expression  <cit> . future experiments identifying smval protein localisation within the adult worms will elucidate whether the connections between scp/taps proteins with reproductive organs exist in the schistosome or the gender-associated transcription is due to other developmental differences.

a final observation of this study was the high level of developmentally-regulated alternative splicing found within the region encoding the long c-terminus of the group  <dig> member smval <dig> . the complex gene structure encoding the smval <dig> c-terminus  allows for alternative splicing of many small exons each in the same phase, avoiding frameshifts. though the relevance of both the long c-terminus and the diversity observed within it is unknown, the developmental regulation of exon  <dig> and  <dig> suggests that the amino acid composition within the c-terminal region may be important for smval <dig> function. developmentally regulated alternative splicing occurs for a few other s. mansoni genes such as ca <dig> and smhsf  <cit> , although these examples result in the introduction of premature stops changing any resulting protein radically, unlike the small changes of exon  <dig> and  <dig> within smval <dig>  one potential biological difference between cercarial and adult worm smval <dig> transcripts is in phosphorylation. exon  <dig> and  <dig>  encode highly similar amino acid pentamers  that are predicted to be phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue . if these are functional phosphorylation sites, many smval6-associated biological processes  could be differentially affected in the cercarial versus the adult life stage. interestingly, group  <dig> gapr- <dig> can be differentially phosphorylated and this phenomenon has been associated with different cellular locations  <cit> . further work to ascertain the relevance of smval <dig> developmentally-regulated splicing, as it applies to function, is ongoing.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified twenty-eight s. mansoni genes encoding proteins containing scp/taps domains, named smval1- <dig>  examination of protein features and gene structures has revealed two distinct groups within the smval gene family and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated both group  <dig> and group  <dig> type scp/taps proteins to be present across the metazoan sub-kingdom. we also obtained developmental expression profiles of smval1- <dig>  which suggested that several of the proteins are involved in host invasion. furthermore, we have discovered developmentally regulated alternative splicing within the 3' region of smval <dig>  further work is aimed at functionally characterising this interesting schistosome protein family in terms of host/parasite and parasite/parasite interactions.
