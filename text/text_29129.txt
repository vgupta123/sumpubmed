BACKGROUND
numerous extracellular roles for the hiv- <dig> transactivator protein  have emerged from experiments showing that tat is taken up by cultured cells, enters the nucleus, and transactivates genes linked to the hiv ltr  <cit> .

early experiments showing that recombinant tat was able to inhibit antigen-induced, but not mitogen-induced, proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated tat as a viral immunosuppressant  <cit> . this view has been confirmed by subsequent observations indicating that: a) tat down-regulates hla class i  <cit>  and class ii  <cit>  expression in t-lymphocytes and macrophages, b) tat represses transcription of the mannose receptor  <cit>  a key molecule in the early response to invading pathogens, c) tat suppresses cd26-dependent t cell proliferation  <cit> , d) tat down-regulates tcr/cd <dig> surface complexes  <cit> , e) tat induces suppressive levels of alpha interferon in t cells  <cit> , and f) tat causes human monocytes to secrete interleukin- <dig>  an anti-inflammatory cytokine  <cit> .

extracellular tat may stimulate virus replication and disease either through receptor-mediated signal transduction or after internalization and transport to the nucleus  <cit> . the basic domain of tat protein  is required for the binding to the viral transactivation-responsive element  and for importingextracellular tat into the cell  <cit> . low concentrations of extracellular tat – similar to those measured in hiv-infected humans, i.e. 2– <dig> ng/ml  <cit>  – have been shown to promote angiogenesis  <cit> , to stimulate growth and motility of cultured kaposi sarcoma cells  <cit> , to induce monocyte chemotaxis through the synthesis of platelet-activating factor  <cit> , to stimulate vascular permeability and the recruitment of mononuclear cells  <cit> . thus, tat has been shown to act through several pathways to establish an adequate cellular environment enhancing viral replication.

the multiple pathogenetic activities of extracellular tat in hiv-infected individuals are unclear, but vaccination with native tat or detoxified derivatives is being tested to prevent pathogenic events that would otherwise lead to a spreading infection  <cit> . the rationale for this approach is that tat is conserved among different virus strains  <cit>  and that vaccination might also protect uninfected bystander cells. human antibodies to tat correlate with nonprogression of hiv disease  <cit>  and have been shown to reduce virus production in hiv-infected cell lines  <cit> . remarkably, monkeys immunized with tat and other hiv antigens were protected from challenge with simian/human immunodeficiency virus  <cit> .

for using biologically active tat as an immunogen, it is desirable to better define its activity on a wide variety of human cells. in this context, it should be considered that most studies have been carried out on cultured cells of lymphoid origin  <cit> , whereas hiv- <dig> is capable of infecting numerous types non-lymphoid cells derived from solid tissues . as an example, hiv has been shown to affect the viability and functions of lung fibroblasts  <cit> , vascular endothelial cells  <cit> , kidney glomerular mesangial cells  <cit> , as well as epithelial cells derived from the mammary gland  <cit> , intestine  <cit> , and kidney  <cit> .

our laboratory has shown that primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells  – that are possibly implicated to the mother-to-child transmission of infection – do express surface cd <dig>  galactosylceramide and cd <dig> and can be infected by hiv- <dig>  <cit> . infection was associated with the up-regulation of surface hla class-ii molecules and cd <dig>  while the expression of cd <dig>  tissue-specific markers, adhesion molecules and growth factor receptors was downregulated by the virus. cytopathic effect ensued. hormones  enhanced hiv replication, possibly by stimulating cell proliferation.

here we analyzed the effects of exogenous tat protein on epithelial cells of mammary and amniotic origin. it was found that the hiv- <dig> transactivator induces the above cells to proliferate and that – a few hours after treatment – expression of surface receptors, cytokines and growth factors of pathogenetic relevance in hiv infection is up-regulated.

RESULTS
cell proliferation in response to exogenous tat
preliminary experiments with a variety of epithelial cell lines have shown that only marginal proliferative responses to tat were observed when cells were grown in complete medium . in contrast, experiments performed using lsm revealed a marked proliferative effect of tat on epithelial cells. the activity of various doses of tat was evaluated with two methods: 1) the xtt assay and 2) cell counts. as shown in figure  <dig>  the xtt assay showed significant proliferative responses when mcf- <dig> and mec- <dig> cell lines were exposed for  <dig> days to doses of tat ≥  <dig> ng/ml. equivalent results have been obtained with recombinant tat101aa and synthetic tat86aa protein preparations . thus, in subsequent experiments cell cultures were exposed to  <dig> ng/ml of tat for different periods of time. in addition to the xtt method, cell proliferation has been measured by direct microscopic counts of cell monolayers. an example of the results is given in figure  <dig>  different numbers of adherent cells can be observed in cultures of mcf- <dig> and mec- <dig> cells either untreated or treated with tat  <dig> ng/ml for  <dig> h. comparable results have been obtained with several different epithelial cell lines. as shown in figure  <dig>  tat consistently induced the proliferation of four different lines of mammary epithelial cells and of the amniotic av- <dig> cell line. in these experiments it was also shown that a monoclonal anti-tat antibody was capable of neutralizing tat proliferative activity. using the av- <dig> cell line, the tat-neutralizing activity of a rabbit polyclonal antibody was also demonstrated . unrelated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to coxsackievirus b <dig> failed to neutralize tat activity . the hormone-dependent spontaneously immortalized mcf-10a line gave the lowest response to tat, whereas consistently higher responses were observed with mcf- <dig> mammary cells and av- <dig> amniotic cells. thus, these two cell lines have been investigated in more detail to study the influence of exogenous tat on gene expression profile.

rt-pcr analysis: tat modulation of hiv- <dig> receptors, growth factors, and cytokine transcripts
semiquantitative rt-pcr was used to evaluate transcript expression in cell cultures exposed to tat. primers for cytokines and vegf were used in conjunction with a series of published primers  to detect alterations of receptor, growth factor and cytokine transcript expression. different time points were used . as shown by transcript analysis of selected hiv- <dig> receptors/co-receptors, gene up-regulation was observed early after tat treatment . results relative to the mcf- <dig> and mec- <dig> cell lines are reported in table  <dig>  comparable results have been obtained with other mammary cell lines . cd <dig> is expressed at low-levels in all investigated cell lines. tat failed to influence cd <dig> expression. cxcr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccr <dig> transcripts were consistently up-regulated after 3– <dig> h treatment with tat. in contrast, ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and ccr <dig> transcripts were not expressed. as shown in figure  <dig>  up-regulation of vefg  was observed in mcf- <dig> cells early after tat exposure . this was concomitant with the up-regulation of vegf receptor- <dig> . this result indicates the possibility of an autocrine loop contributing to tat-stimulated cell proliferation. vegf up-regulation was also observed in the other epithelial cell lines using the gene-array technique. up-regulation of il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor has also been detected in mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cells . il- <dig> has been shown to contribute to epithelial cell differentiation in both thyroid and the mammary gland  <cit> . tat did not influence the expression of il- <dig>  a neutrophil-attracting cytokine produced by mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . exposure to tat for  <dig> h was followed by up-regulation of tgf-beta <dig> and tgf-beta <dig> in mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cells. real time rt-pcr confirmed that the expression of il- <dig>  il-6-r, tgf-beta <dig>  and vegf  was enhanced from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold in cells treated with tat for  <dig> h. as seen by rt-pcr, expression of cpsf <dig>  <cit>  was not modified by  <dig> to  <dig> h treatment with tat .

gene array studies. genes up-regulated by tat in both mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cell lines
gene-arrays were used to compare gene expression in control untreated and tat-treated cell cultures. tables  <dig> and  <dig> summarize the results of cultures of mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cells exposed to tat for  <dig> h. genes that were up-regulated ≥ <dig> -fold in both cell lines are reported. up-regulation is expressed as change  for each cell line. the last column shows the average up-regulation in the two cell lines. fifty of  <dig> genes  related to the cell cycle were up-regulated from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold. twenty-four of  <dig> genes  coding for growth factors, cytokines and their receptors were up-regulated from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold.

the up-regulation of a wide spectrum of genes involved in cell cycle regulation that is presented here for two epithelial cell lines confirms the observed proliferative effect of tat on non-lymphoid cell lines. as shown in table  <dig>  tat treatment was associated with increased expression of: a) transcription factors ; b) cyclins ; c) cyclin-dependent kinases and associated proteins ; d) cell division cycle proteins cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc45); e) genes involved in dna repair ; f) cullins and associated proteins ; g) nuclear factors associated with dna replication ; h) factors involved in cell cycle arrest ; i) apoptosis-related genes .

tat treatment was also associated with the increased transcription of selected growth factors, cytokines and receptors. table  <dig> shows that the following genes were up-regulated in both mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cells: a) cytokines of the il- <dig> superfamily and a signal-transducing molecule ; b) inflammatory cytokines ; c) chemokines and their receptors ; d) members of the pdgf/vegf growth factor family ; e) factors belonging to the tgf-beta family ; f) anti-inflammatory cytokines of the il- <dig> family . exposure to tat of the av- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cell lines was not associated with downregulation of any of the tested genes.

discussion
our experiments confirm that low concentrations of extracellular tat are capable of affecting cell proliferation and cellular physiology. we have shown that different epithelial cell lines cultured under low-serum conditions are induced to proliferate by doses of extracellular tat of at least  <dig> ng/ml. the tat dose used in these experiments  is close to that measured in the plasma of some hiv-1-infected patients . the values reported  <cit>  could be underestimated because local concentrations of tat in infected tissues are probably higher as tat may be sequestered by anti-tat antibodies and by glycosaminoglycans. tat produced in hiv-infected cells is released extracellularly and is able to stimulate the growth of kaposi sarcoma cells at concentrations < <dig> ng/ml  <cit> . in the quoted paper, activation of cells by extracellular tat required concentrations of  <dig> ng/ml or more. extracellular tat has also been shown to enhance the proliferation of germinal center b cells  <cit>  and renal podocytes  <cit> . tat is also involved in the progression of tumors arising in tat-transgenic mice  <cit> . in lymphoid and neural cells tat has also been shown to inhibit cell growth and cause apoptosis  <cit> . pathways leading to cell death depend on the cell lineage and involve activation of death receptor pathways , chemokine receptor signaling, cytokine dysregulation, caspase activation, calcium mobilization, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential.

in hiv replication cycle, tat is known to interact with the transcription factor iif and thereby to increase the activity of cdk <dig>  thus allowing rna polymerase ii to transcribe the tat activation region of the virus ltr  <cit> . up-regulation of cdk <dig> by exogenous tat has been demonstrated also in this study. using tat-transfected cell lines  <cit> , tat was shown to stimulate mrna processing through up-regulation of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor  <dig> . up-regulation of cpsf <dig> was held responsible for stimulating viral and cellular gene expression. in contrast, in our experimental model and within  <dig> to  <dig> h exposure, tat failed to induce cpsf <dig> up-regulation. cell conditions different from those employed by us may be operative in tat-expressing cell lines  <cit> .

increased expression of several transcription factors and cyclin/cdk complexes has been observed in tat-treated epithelial cells. genes involved in different phases of the cell cycle are activated, including genes  linked to cell cycle arrest and negative modulation or apoptosis. these seemingly opposite effects of tat on cell cycle regulators require some additional comments. tat may either act directly on the transcription of negative regulators of cell cycle, or their up-regulation may be part of a negative feed back loop generated by an excessive increase of cell cycle inducers. within this frame, it is of interest to note that extracellular tat can inhibit p <dig> functions, thus providing a candidate mechanism through which hiv- <dig> might contribute to cell cycle dysregulation and malignant transformation  <cit> . indeed, though the expression of p <dig> was not increased in epithelial cells exposed to tat, the expression of mdm <dig>  was strongly up-regulated. this is in contrast to recent findings showing repression of the mdm <dig> gene promoter in cells transfected with tat constructs  <cit> . p21cip <dig> – an important factor whose expression is regulated by p <dig> and that blocks cell replication in g <dig> by inhibiting cdk-cyclin complexes – was strongly up-regulated in tat-treated cells. thus, further studies are needed to assess the balance between activation and inhibition of cell cycle genes produced by tat in cells of different lineages. these studies might help designing innovative antiviral therapies  <cit> . measurements of epithelial cell growth in response to extracellular tat could represent auseful model in this context.

as shown in kaposi sarcoma cells  <cit> , our studies confirm that extracellular tat up-regulates the expression of vegf receptor- <dig> . tat also enhanced the expression of multiple angiogenic stimuli . this was seen both by rt-pcr analysis and gene arrays. in addition to stimulating angiogenesis, these factors are also capable of stimulating epithelial cell growth by autocrine mechanisms. in renal mesangial cells, persistent hiv replication was shown to induce expression of pdgfa/b and tgfb  <cit> , cytokines that mediate mesangial cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition.

rt-pcr and gene array studies revealed the increased expression of some chemokine receptors serving as hiv coreceptors . cxcr <dig> is the high affinity receptor for sdf- <dig>  while ccr <dig> binds rantes. the enhanced expression of cxcr <dig> and ccr <dig> in epithelial cells exposed to tat suggests that their susceptibility to t- and m-tropic viruses may be increased since these cells express basal levels of cd <dig> and are permissive to hiv- <dig>  <cit> . enhanced expression of hiv co-receptors has also been shown in monocytes  <cit> , basophils  <cit> , and erythroid cells  <cit> . expression of sdf- <dig>  rantes and other chemotactic cytokines  was also increased. the ability of tat to signalthrough chemokines and their receptors is supposed to attract lymphoid cells toward virus producing cells, thus favoring the spread ofinfection. up-regulation of the il <dig> family factors  may promote cell growth  <cit> . increased expression of the inflammatory cytokine lt-b  may co-operate with il <dig> in the reactivation of hiv in cd <dig> t lymphocytes harboring a latent provirus  <cit> . up-regulation of il <dig> is also of interest since this cytokine stimulates virus replication. increased il <dig> levels have been reported in hiv-infected patients  <cit> . up-regulation of mif expression may contribute to recruit macrophages at sites of inflammation.

the significance of the increased expression of bmps is unclear. bmps have been identified as factors that induce ectopic bone and cartilage production. bmps constitute the largest subfamily of the tgfb superfamily of growth factors and exert pleiotropic biological effects ranging from regulation of early developmental processes to organogenesis and differentiation of bone, cartilage, epidermal and neural tissues  <cit> . the increased expression of tgfb found in tat-treated epithelial cells is a common feature of hiv-1-infected cells and is thought to be an important determinant of immunosuppression  <cit> . expression of interferon-alpha  could not be detected in epithelial cells  <cit> .

expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and il- <dig> appears a remarkable feature of epithelial cell lines. in particular, high-level expression of il- <dig> has been detected not only in mcf- <dig> and av- <dig> cells, but also in other mammary and thyroid cell lines. il- <dig> is a th- <dig> cytokine supposed to limit hiv- <dig> replication in vivo through inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines  by lymphoid cells  <cit> . il- <dig> receptor transcripts  have not been detected in tat-treated epithelial cells. il- <dig> and il- <dig> are cytokines identified as il- <dig> homologs that share the same receptor complex, indicating that the biological activities of the two cytokines overlap. both appear to regulate development and proper functioning of the skin. because the simultaneous presence of both receptor subunits  is requiredfor il- <dig> activity in a cell, only tissues that express bothsubunits represent potential targetsfor il- <dig>  the skin, testis, ovary, heart, lung, muscle, placenta, adrenal gland, small intestine, and salivary gland appear to express both receptors  <cit> . expression of both il- <dig> receptorsubunits in skin is of a particular interest since il- <dig> is up-regulated in psoriatic skin. as for il- <dig>  the pattern of expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig> indicates that these cytokines may be involved in the regulationof inflammatory responses. up-regulation of il- <dig> has been associated with the mother-to-child transmission of human cytomegalovirus  <cit> , with peak replication of feline immunodeficiency virus in vivo  <cit> , and in hiv-infected patients  <cit> . up-regulation of il- <dig> mrna has been observed in epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
extracellular tat has a mitogenic effect on mammary and amniotic epithelial cells and stimulates the expression of genes of pathogenetic significance in hiv infection. of particular interest is that tat enhances the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines of the il- <dig> family. these multiple activities may also help explain the mother-to-child transmission of hiv.
