BACKGROUND
purinergic signalling plays a significant role in neurotransmission and neuromodulation in many regions of the brain as well as in the spinal cord and peripheral neurons  <cit> . among purinergic agonists, extracellular atp is a potent signalling molecule abundantly present in the central nervous system. atp is secreted from many neurons as a cotransmitter by vesicular exocytotic release, but also leaks from injured or dying cells  <cit> . in addition, many cell types, including glial cells, can also release atp in response to stimuli such as hypoxia or certain agonists independently of cell damage and thereby modulate the function of adjacent neurons.

once released into the extracellular space, atp acts on specific receptors that belong to two main subclasses: ligand-gated p2x cation-selective channels and g protein-coupled p2y receptors  <cit> . both receptor classes evoke calcium responses. p2x receptors can induce depolarisation-induced calcium entry and are permeable to ca2+, whereas most p2y receptors couple to phospholipase cβ isoforms, which leads to the release of ca2+ from internal stores. purinergic effects mediated by ca2+ signalling include presynaptic neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion, calcium wave propagation between astrocytes and activation of primary nociceptive neurons  <cit> .

although purinergic receptors are abundant in the nervous system and have been extensively characterised with respect to their short-term effects on neuronal function, less is known about the long-term effects of their activation in neurons. there is evidence that extracellular nucleotides affect neuronal differentiation and survival, but the signalling pathways that mediate these effects are largely unexplored  <cit> . specifically, the increase in intracellular ca2+ concentrations after activation of purinergic receptors is expected to influence gene expression. the calcineurin-nfat  pathway is a major mediator of ca2+ effects on gene expression in neuronal cells and plays a key role in neuronal development and function  <cit> . surprisingly, the effects of purinergic receptors on nfat signalling and nfat-dependent gene expression have not yet been studied in neuronal cells.

the rat pheochromocytoma cell line pc <dig> is a well-characterised model system for purinergic effects. pc <dig> cells express p2x and p2y receptors and show increases in intracellular ca2+ concentration upon stimulation with extracellular atp  <cit> . extracellular atp stimulates catecholamine release from pc <dig> cells, enhances their sensitivity to nerve growth factor, promotes neurite outgrowth and regulates cytoskeleton remodelling  <cit> . moreover, pc <dig> cells express the components of the calcineurin-nfat pathway and have been used to characterise nfat-dependent changes in gene expression  <cit> .

here we have tested the hypothesis that extracellular atp can modulate gene expression in neuronal cells via the calcineurin-nfat pathway. we show that atp stimulates nfat transcriptional activity through the activation of p2x receptors, causes the activation of erk1/ <dig> kinases and induces the expression of an nfat target gene in pc <dig> cells. these results suggest that extracellular atp can act on neuronal cells by inducing nfat-dependent changes in gene expression.

RESULTS
extracellular atp induces nfat-dependent reporter gene activity in pc <dig> cells
to study the effect of extracellular atp on the activation of nfat in neuronal cells, we generated a stable pc <dig> subclone expressing luciferase under the control of a nfat-driven promoter . treatment of pc12-nfat-luc cells with atp strongly induced luciferase activity, with a maximal response at  <dig> μm atp  . significant stimulation of nfat activation was detected at a concentration as low as  <dig> μm atp . the half-maximal effect was produced at a concentration of ec <dig> =  <dig> μm atp. it is important to note that the actual concentration of atp is not constant during the incubation time of  <dig> h because pc <dig> cells express multiple ecto-atpases  <cit> . under the conditions of this experiment, the half life of atp was ~  <dig> min . no obvious toxicity was observed in the trypan blue uptake test after treatment of the cells with  <dig> μm atp for  <dig> h.

pharmacological characterisation of purinergic receptors that mediate nfat activation in pc <dig> cells
we aimed to characterise the purinergic receptor responsible for the stimulatory effect of atp on nfat with different agonists and antagonists. for comparison, we used the calcium ionophore calcimycin  in combination with the pkc activator, pma. this treatment serves as a positive control to activate nfat in a receptor-independent manner  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  maximal induction of nfat-dependent promoter activity by atp exceeded that elicited by calcimycin/pma. in contrast, utp, which is an agonist of some p2y receptor subtypes, only marginally stimulated reporter gene activity. the atp derivatives α,β-meatp, which acts as an agonist on receptors containing p2x <dig> or p2x <dig> subunits  <cit> , and bzatp, which can activate several p2x subtypes  and human p2y <dig>  had minimal effects on nfat.

to further examine the receptors responsible for nfat activation in pc <dig> cells, we used the p2x receptor antagonist ppads . treatment of the pc12-nfat-luc cells with  <dig> μm ppads strongly suppressed the induction of luciferase activity by atp, suggesting that at least one of the ppads-sensitive p2x subunits  is involved in nfat activation.

expression analysis of p2x receptor subunits and nfat isoforms in pc <dig> cells
the presence of the mrna for the seven p2x receptor subtypes was analysed by rt-pcr. as shown in figure 3a, bands of the expected size were detected for p2x <dig> and p2x3- <dig>  a more complex pattern of bands was obtained with the p2x2-specific primers. sequencing revealed that the two main bands corresponded to variants of p2x <dig>  that differ by an alternatively spliced region in the c-terminal domain  <cit> . although p2x <dig> appears to be most strongly expressed among the p2x receptors, it must be noted that bands obtained by end-point pcr amplification of different target sequences cannot be quantitatively compared. transcripts for p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> were below the detection level under our conditions . expression of all of the  <dig> ca2+-responsive nfatc isoforms was readily shown by rt-pcr .

mechanisms of cytosolic ca2+ increase
activation of nfat depends on elevated ca2+ concentrations in the cytosol. our tentative identification of a p2x receptor raises questions about the molecular mechanism of the ca2+ response. depletion of extracellular ca2+ prevented the induction of luciferase activity , supporting the notion that ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is required for the activation of nfat by atp. the ca2+ needed for activation of calcineurin could enter the cell directly through p2x cation channels and/or via voltage-gated ca2+ channels that open as a consequence of p2x-mediated membrane depolarisation.

to test the latter possibility, we studied the effect of the l-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, on the induction of luciferase by atp at the optimal concentration of atp in this assay  as well as a suboptimal concentration of  <dig> μm atp . nifedipine strongly reduced nfat activation but did not completely prevent the effect of atp, indicating that a major part of the nfat response depends on ca2+ influx through l-type ca2+ channels.

next we asked whether store-operated ca2+ entry  contributed to the effect of atp on nfat activation. the pyrazole derivative btp <dig> is a blocker of soce and inhibits nfat effects in different cell types, including t lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes  <cit> . treatment with btp <dig> reduced nfat activation in pc <dig> cells in a concentration-dependent manner . partial but significant inhibition was observed at submicromolar concentrations , at which btp <dig> is thought to specifically inhibit soce  <cit> . a maximal effect of 72% inhibition was observed at a concentration of  <dig> μm btp <dig>  it must be noted that the direct molecular target of btp <dig> are still not well defined  <cit> , and the unsteady slope of the concentration-response curve might suggest that there is more than one target affected by btp <dig>  taken together, these results suggest that the maximal activation of nfat by extracellular atp in pc <dig> cells requires the influx of extracellular ca2+ ions both via voltage-dependent calcium channels and a btp2-sensitive mechanism.

pathway for the atp activation of nfat
we used specific inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2b/calcineurin  and protein kinase mek <dig>  to examine the intracellular pathways involved in nfat activation. fk <dig> suppressed atp-induced luciferase activity, confirming that the reporter gene expression indeed depended on the calcineurin-nfat pathway . interestingly, the mek inhibitor pd <dig> also reduced reporter gene activity, suggesting that activation of the mek/erk1/ <dig> cascade was required for maximal induction of nfat transcriptional activity. to verify that extracellular atp can activate the mek/erk pathway, pc <dig> cells were treated with varying concentrations of atp, and activation of erk1/ <dig> was monitored by western blot analysis with an activation-state specific antibody . phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> was well detectable after treatment with  <dig>  μm of atp. this response was fully dependent on extracellular ca2+ and was partially inhibited by ppads , suggesting that erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation required the activation of p2x receptors.

effect of extracellular atp on nfat target genes
finally, we aimed to confirm that extracellular atp regulates the expression of endogenous nfat target genes in pc <dig> cells. firstly, we examined the effect of atp on mrna levels of rcan1- <dig> , which is a target transcript of nfat in various cell types, including neurons  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, transcript levels of rcan1- <dig> were significantly induced by treatment with atp, indicating that the activation of nfat by purinergic receptors elicits transcriptional changes in pc <dig> cells. the upregulation of rcan1- <dig> mrna depended on the activation of the calcineurin-nfat pathway, as confirmed by the inhibitory effect of fk <dig>  as a second nfat target transcript, we analysed the levels of the exon iv-containing transcripts of the bdnf gene. transcripts of the bdnf gene can initiate with either of at least  <dig> different 5'-exons  <cit> , of which the bdnf exon iv-containing transcripts are selectively induced by the influx of extracellular calcium  <cit> , and promoter iv is known to contain a nfat response element  <cit> . similar to rcan1- <dig>  we observed an increase of the bdnf-iv transcripts in atp stimulated cells that was blocked by treatment with fk <dig> . however, these changes did not reach the level of statistical significance.

discussion
our results show that the ca2+ response elicited by extracellular atp in neuronal cells translates into changes in gene expression that are mediated by the transcription factor nfat. in the pc <dig> cells that we used as a model system, nfat activation by atp required the influx of ca2+ from the extracellular space and depended on the activation of p2x receptors and the function of l-type voltage-dependent ca2+ channels. the calcineurin-nfat pathway plays an important role in neuronal development, and our results support the assumption that purinergic receptors transmit some of their trophic effects by this mechanism  <cit> .

based on the results of the present study, we propose the following working model for the signalling events that result in nfat activation . firstly, the requirement of extracellular ca2+ and the inhibitory effect of nifedipine clearly indicate that the activation of ionotropic p2x receptors, as opposed to the metabotropic p2y or p <dig> receptors, is essential for nfat activation. our result is in accordance with previous studies of atp-induced ca2+ influx in pc <dig> cells  <cit> , which showed that na+ influx through p2x <dig> receptors can cause sufficient membrane depolarisation to activate l-type voltage-gated ca2+ channels. the fact that even  <dig> μm of nifedipine incompletely blocked nfat activation suggests that other mechanisms, such as direct ca2+ entry through the p2x receptor pore or a btp2-sensitive channel , contribute to the atp-induced ca2+ response.

secondly, the pharmacological characterisation of the purinergic receptor responsible for nfat activation supports the hypothesis that a p2x receptor is critically involved. at a concentration of  <dig> μm, ppads is an antagonist of homo- or heteromeric p2x complexes that contain p2x <dig>  p2x <dig>  p2x <dig> or p2x <dig> subunits but does not inhibit p2x <dig> and p2x <dig>  <cit> . variable potencies have been reported for the inhibition of p2x <dig> by ppads, with ic <dig> values ranging from ~ <dig> nm to >  <dig> μm. however, we can exclude p2x <dig> here as the relevant receptor because  <dig> μm bzatp failed to induce luciferase expression despite the fact that rat p2x <dig> is highly responsive to bzatp in the low μm range  <cit> . in addition, p2x <dig> is a low affinity atp receptor , whereas significant nfat activation in pc <dig> cells was already detectable at low micromolar concentrations of atp. the result that p2x <dig> does not account for nfat activation by extracellular atp in pc <dig> cells is important because p2x <dig> mediates nfat activation in other cell types such as microglia and t cells  <cit> . finally, the lack of an effect of  <dig> μm α,β -meatp excludes the possibility that p2x <dig> or p2x <dig> induces the activation of nfat in pc <dig> cells because these receptors are activated by submicromolar concentrations of this agonist  <cit> . thus, p2x <dig> and p2x <dig> remain as the most likely candidates for activating receptors in this pathway.

based on our data as well as published results, we favour the hypothesis that p2x <dig> is responsible for the major part of the atp-induced ca2+-influx and nfat activation in our cell model for three reasons: i) the p2x <dig> receptor was originally cloned from pc <dig> cells  <cit>  and appears to be the major p2x isoform in undifferentiated pc <dig> cells, whereas p2x <dig> was either reported to be undetectable  <cit>  or found to be expressed at lower levels , ii) calcium influx through p2x <dig> receptors results in the activation of the map kinase cascade  <cit> , and iii) p2x <dig> differs from other p2x isoforms, including p2x <dig>  in its slow desensitisation kinetics  <cit>  and is thus capable of causing sufficient depolarisation of pc <dig> cells to induce ca2+ influx via l-type voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> . the rt-pcr analysis of the pc <dig> clone used in the present study confirmed that the cells express both the slowly desensitising p2x2a isoform and the fast desensitising p2x2b splicing variants .

thirdly, we showed that, in addition to the dependence on calcineurin activity, maximal nfat activation also depended on the activation of erk1/ <dig> . similarly, mek1-erk1/ <dig> signalling augments nfat transcriptional activity in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes  <cit> . as suggested by sanna et al.  <cit> , the mek1-erk1/ <dig> pathway and the calcineurin-nfat pathway may converge at the level of the transcription factors. importantly, ca2+-induced calcineurin activity alone is not always sufficient to activate nfat-dependent transcriptional activity, but a second signal that activates the nuclear partner protein of nfat  may be required . ap <dig>  which is a target of erk1/ <dig>  is one of the nuclear partners of nfat  <cit> . the simultaneous activation of calcineurin and the mek-erk1/ <dig> pathway may explain the very strong atp-induced nfat activation that exceeds the effect elicited by the control treatment .

finally, we have shown that btp <dig> partially inhibited atp-induced nfat activation in pc <dig> cells , indicating that a btp2-sensitive ca2+ influx is necessary for the maximal response under the experimental conditions chosen . btp <dig> is a selective inhibitor of capacitative ca2+ entry and does not affect ca2+ handling by mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum or other ca2+ channels  <cit> . nfat activation in lymphocytes strictly depends on store-operated ca2+ entry  <cit> , but there exist conflicting data about the contribution of soce to ca2+ responses in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . unfortunately, although several transient receptor potential  channels have been proposed as targets of btp <dig>  <cit> , the primary target of btp <dig> is still a matter of debate, and the ic <dig> values obtained in different experimental systems vary significantly  <cit> . therefore, the nature of the btp2-sensitive mechanism in pc <dig> cells cannot be deduced from the present experiments, although a trpc channel may contribute to ca2+ influx in pc <dig> cells.

we have found that extracellular atp upregulates rcan1- <dig> mrna, which is known to be transcribed from an nfat-regulated promoter  <cit> . rcan <dig> encodes a negative feedback regulator of calcineurin and has multiple effects in neurons, including regulation of vesicle exocytosis, long-term potentiation and facilitation of apoptosis  <cit> . however, nfat has many more functions in central and peripheral neurons, in particular as a transcription factor that transduces effects of neurotrophins and membrane depolarisation  <cit> . atp is well known to change gene expression in neurons and has multiple effects on neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation and neuroprotection  <cit> . based on the results obtained in neuronal pc <dig> cells as a model system, we propose that the calcineurin-nfat pathway is a novel mechanism that mediates the trophic functions of extracellular atp on neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of atp-induced nfat activation in pc <dig> cells has identified a novel pathway through which extracellular atp can regulate neuronal gene expression and thereby modulate the function and development of neurons. in contrast to immune cells and glia, where p2x <dig> mediates activation of nfat, available evidence suggests that, in neurons, p2x <dig> accounts for this effect. p2x <dig> produces depolarisation-induced calcium influx through l-type ca2+ channels and the activation of mek-erk1/ <dig> signalling, which are both required for maximal nfat activation. we propose this pathway as a more general mechanism by which extracellular atp can exert long-term effects on neuronal cells, which remains to be studied under physiological conditions.
