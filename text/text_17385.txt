BACKGROUND
prokaryotic transcriptomes change not only in response to physiological parameters but also to genetic rearrangements mediated by mobile elements. plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that replicate autonomously, and many can be transmitted between different strains through conjugation. plasmids provide benefits to their hosts, such as resistance to antibiotics or degradation of recalcitrant aromatic compounds  <cit> ; however, in several cases, the carriage of a large plasmid results in changes in the transcriptome of the host chromosome  <cit> . similar to the effects of plasmid carriage on the transcriptional network of the host chromosome, differences in host background can alter the transcription patterns of backbone and accessory genes on a plasmid. many plasmid backbone genes essential for conjugative transfer, replication initiation, and active partitioning are regulated both autogenously and by host factors  <cit> . additionally, a number of plasmid-encoded degradative accessory genes that constitute relatively large catabolic operons  <cit>  are coordinately regulated by specific plasmid-encoded transcriptional regulators and chromosomal regulatory elements  <cit> .

the  <dig> -bp completely sequenced catabolic plasmid pcar <dig>  which was originally isolated from pseudomonas resinovorans ca <dig>  encodes the degradation pathway of carbazole, a nitrogen-containing recalcitrant aromatic compound  <cit> . pcar <dig> carries the car and ant operons, both of which are induced by anthranilate, a carbazole intermediate, and which are under the control of the arac/xyls family activator antr  <cit> . pcar <dig> has been characterized as a self-transmissible and narrow-host-range plasmid that belongs to incompatibility group p- <dig> ; the conjugative transfer of pcar <dig> enables the completely sequenced bacterium p. putida kt <dig>  <cit>  to grow on carbazole as the sole carbon source  <cit> . using an expression microarray of the kt <dig> chromosome coupled with pcar <dig>  we previously analyzed the differential expression of both pcar <dig> and the kt <dig> chromosome during growth on carbazole and succinate, and found that pcar <dig> successfully functioned in the host and affected the chromosomal transcriptome  <cit> . however, we did not address whether and how the plasmid transcriptome in the original host differed from that in the transconjugant; thus, in this study, we focused on the transcriptomes of pcar <dig> in the heterologous host bacteria.

recent increases in microarray feature density have allowed the construction of tiling arrays, which contain overlapping probes that may be used to target any region of a sequenced genome. transcriptome analyses using unbiased high-density tiling arrays have been used to detect individual exons of a spliced transcript and multifunctional and extensive transcription from both strands of human dna  <cit> . as for prokaryotic transcriptomes, high-density tiling arrays aimed at the genome-wide determination of transcription start sites in e. coli and caulobacter crescentus contain probes targeting intergenic regions  <cit> . in this study, we used an unbiased tiling array with evenly tiled probes at a 9-bp density to identify the entire operonic structure from transcription initiation to termination. the use of a high-resolution tiling array allowed us to visualize the transcriptome of the plasmid independent of the host background. a comparison of plasmid transcriptomes between the original host and transconjugant revealed similarities and differences in the transcription patterns of the plasmid.

RESULTS
mapping of single-stranded cdna using the pcar <dig> tiling array
two pcar1-harboring strains, the original host p. resinovorans ca <dig> and the transconjugant p. putida kt <dig>  were grown to the exponential phase using carbazole or succinate as the sole source of carbon. single-stranded cdna was synthesized from total culture rna using random primers. although the affymetrix rna mapping protocol recommends synthesizing second-strand dna from first-strand cdna using a dna polymerase, we hybridized the single-stranded cdna to the tiling array in order to preserve the strand directionality of the prokaryotic transcriptome.

the resulting high-resolution map showed that the pcar <dig> transcriptome consisted of identical transcription units regardless of the host background . using the integrated genome browser , we identified a total of  <dig> transcription units that were transcribed continuously at a signal intensity above  <dig> , including two overlapping operons that were transcribed from multiple initiation sites and three small transcripts identified as non-coding rnas . the average length of each transcription unit was  <dig>  kb, and 72%  of the entire sequence of pcar <dig> was transcribed.

the transcription units of pcar <dig> and their median signal intensities on both the sense and antisense strands are indicated; kt_suc, kt <dig> grown on succinate; kt_car, kt <dig> grown on carbazole; ca_suc, ca <dig> grown on succinate; ca_car, ca <dig> grown on carbazole. the positions of the transcription start and stop sites correspond to the pcar <dig> nucleotide sequence .

unexpectedly, we observed numerous signals on the antisense strand in the coding regions. these signals likely represent experimental artifacts generated by secondary mispriming during reverse transcription using random primers  <cit>  since no signal was detect on the antisense strand by hybridization of cdna synthesized using strand-specific primers . to estimate how much of the single-stranded cdna synthesized using random primers contained these artifacts, the median signal intensities were calculated from probes located within the pcar <dig> genes. the correlation coefficients between the sense and antisense values on a log <dig> scale were  <dig> â€“ <dig>  . the plots were approximated to the line y = x- <dig>  indicating that the intensity of the sense signals was approximately four times higher than that of the antisense signals. in addition, the log <dig> ratios of the signal intensities for each probe on one strand to those on the other strand were frequently  <dig> and - <dig> , suggesting that ~20% of the signals detected on the antisense strand in the coding regions represent artifacts. therefore, we subsequently analyzed only the sense signal intensities.

to estimate the sensitivity of the tiling array, the median signal intensities of the pcar <dig> genes in kt <dig> were compared to those calculated as part of our previous expression array analysis  <cit> . overall, the signal intensities of the pcar <dig> genes, especially the frequently transcribed genes, exhibited a strong correlation between the two microarray platforms . however, a significant decrease in the pearson correlation coefficient was detected in the low-signal-intensity plots, which were distributed more widely in the tiling array analysis than in the expression array analysis, indicating that tiling arrays are superior in terms of sensitivity to traditional gene-centered microarrays.

transcription pattern of the pcar <dig> accessory genes
pcar <dig> carries a  <dig> -kb class ii transposon, tn <dig> , which confers the ability to degrade carbazole  <cit> . within tn <dig>  the ant operon is transcribed from the inducible promoter pant  <cit> , whereas the car operon is transcribed from the inducible promoter pant upstream of open reading frame   <dig> and additionally from the constitutive promoter pcaraa within the coding region of orf <dig>  <cit> . the arac/xyls family transcriptional regulator antr, which is encoded on tn <dig>  activates the pant promoter in response to anthranilate, an intermediate of the carbazole degradation pathway. the transcription of antr originates from an rpon-dependent promoter and is induced during growth on carbazole  <cit> . as expected, our tiling array results indicated that growth on carbazole strongly induced these catabolic operons in both hosts compared to growth on succinate . the  <dig> - and  <dig> -kb transcripts of antabc and antr were significantly induced during growth on carbazole . the ~13-kb transcript of the car operon was also detected; it was induced during growth on carbazole and constitutively produced during growth on succinate . intriguingly, the level of transcription of the lower car operon, which is composed of carfe, was apparently higher in ca <dig> than in kt <dig> regardless of the carbon source. the transcription start sites of anta, antr, and orf <dig> indicated by our tiling array  agreed with those identified through primer extension analysis  <cit> . although our previous data showed constitutive transcription of the car operon from 385-bp upstream of caraa  <cit> , our tiling array analysis detected only slightly constitutive transcription in both strains during growth on succinate and could not identify the transcription start site .

to verify the transcription levels estimated by our tiling array analysis, we performed quantitative rt-pcr and calculated the relative abundance of the pcar <dig> mrnas normalized by 16s rrna. during growth on carbazole, the transcription of anta and antr was significantly increased by ~200- and ~100-fold to the same level in both hosts . the transcription of the upper car operon, which originates from the dual promoters, was also upregulated by ~20-fold with a negligible difference between the hosts . in contrast, the transcription of the lower car operon was significantly higher in ca <dig> than in kt <dig> . these results suggest that the car operon possesses additional promoters that are preferentially activated in the original host.

tn <dig> encodes the transposase tnpac and its repressor tnpc at one end and the cointegrate resolvase tnpst at the other. the transcription of tnpac was induced during growth on carbazole in both hosts, consistent with previous microarray results  <cit> , but the basal level of transcription for tnpac was higher in kt <dig> than in ca <dig> during growth on succinate . the levels of the divergent tnps and tnpt transcripts were unaffected by the growth conditions and were slightly higher in kt <dig> . it is noteworthy that tn <dig> contains three identical ispre <dig> insertion sequences, two of which are located on either end of the car operon, with the third located upstream of the ant operon  <cit> . our tiling array data revealed nearly identical transcription patterns within these insertion sequences . this indicates the equivalent detection sensitivities of the contiguous probes, because transcripts of ispre <dig> were detected equally on both strands using different probes shifted by several nucleotides.

transcription pattern of incp- <dig> plasmid backbone
the pcar <dig> plasmid contains divergent repa and parwabc genes for its replication and active partitioning, which are conserved among incp- <dig> plasmids  <cit> . our tiling array analysis showed that repa was transcribed at a low level and that the level of transcription was unaffected by the host background or carbon source . the transcription of the par gene cluster originated from parw and para, although the promoter activity of para was much higher than that of parw .

a large gene cluster encoding the conjugative transfer apparatus of incp- <dig> plasmids has been reported only for the self-transmissible plasmid pcar <dig>  <cit> . the host range and conjugative transfer frequency of pcar <dig> depends on the recipient and donor species; pcar <dig> efficiently transfers between species with the same genetic background  <cit> . high-resolution mapping revealed that the overall transfer gene cluster was transcribed at a low level ; however, two operons flanking the transfer gene cluster  were transcribed at significantly higher levels in the transconjugant strain kt <dig> than in the original host strain ca <dig> .

quantitative rt-pcr verified that the transcription levels of orf <dig> and orf <dig> were significantly higher in kt <dig> than in ca <dig> and during growth on succinate than on carbazole . to characterize the promoters of orf <dig> and orf <dig>  we performed a primer extension analysis using the same total rna used in our tiling array analysis. the transcription start sites were mapped to 141-nt and 522-nt upstream of the translation start sites of orf <dig> and orf <dig>  respectively , in agreement with our tiling array data. the signal intensities of the primer extension products also corresponded to our quantitative rt-pcr results. however, we were unable to identify a consensus motif between the promoter regions of orf <dig> and orf <dig>  these results suggest that the two operons are regulated by different mechanisms in the two hosts.

a search of the aclame database  <cit>  indicated that the genes within orf100- <dig> are conserved in the inch plasmid r <dig>  <cit> , the inct plasmid rts <dig>  <cit> , and the integrating conjugative elements sxt  <cit>  and r <dig>  <cit> . orf <dig> encodes a moxr-like aaa+ atpase with a c-terminal cbbq domain that is associated with various cellular activities  <cit> . many genes in the aaa+ family have been found in close proximity to genes that encode proteins with von willebrand factor type a  domains  <cit> , and we found that orf <dig> actually encodes a vwa protein. the vwa domain is a well-studied domain associated with cell adhesion, extracellular matrix proteins, and integrin receptors  <cit> . orf <dig> and orf <dig>  which encode a putative nickase and primase, respectively, are located upstream of the traf-trhh-trhg gene cluster, which is involved in pilus assembly  <cit> ; however, they were transcribed separately. our high-resolution map showed a significant decrease in the transcription of orf <dig> at approximately nucleotide position  <dig>  , raising the possibility that orf <dig> is dysfunctional or at least rarely transcribed. since the conjugative host range and transfer frequency of pcar <dig> are thought to depend on the donor strain  <cit> , these findings suggest that orf100- <dig> and orf145- <dig> are involved in the conjugative transfer of pcar <dig> and that the transcription levels of these operons in donor cells may affect the behavior of pcar <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
using a tiling array, we identified the complete transcriptome of pcar <dig> and demonstrated that the level of transcription of several operons was host-dependent. many of the genes carried on bacterial plasmids have not been adequately annotated or functionally characterized; thus, functional genomic approaches are necessary to identify novel genes with important roles in the relationship between plasmids and their hosts. this study demonstrates that the plasmid transcriptome is affected by the host background, while recent studies have indicated that the carriage of a large plasmid results in a change in the transcriptome of the host chromosome  <cit> . therefore, we conclude that conjugative transfer results in bidirectional alterations in the transcriptional networks of the plasmid and host chromosome.

the unbiased nature of tiling arrays allows the simultaneous identification and quantification of the prokaryotic transcriptome including polycistronic operons and non-coding rnas. the transcription start sites identified by tiling array analysis may be verified by primer extension analysis. the number of transcripts indicated by quantitative rt-pcr is comparable among different growth conditions and genetic backgrounds. tiling array technology is a powerful tool for the analysis of prokaryotic transcriptomes, and it may be used to determine the complete operonic structure of a bacterial genome.
