BACKGROUND
the mechanism of segmentation of the vertebrate embryo depends on waves of gene expression progressing through the presomitic mesoderm  along the antero-posterior axis of the body  <cit>  and involves regulation of genes from the notch, fgf and wnt pathways  <cit> . perturbations of this process cause congenital vertebral malformations   <cit> , however, in many cases their mechanism is not known, although impressive amounts of experimental profiles including whole-genome expression data have been collected  <cit> . according to the “clock-and-wavefront” model  <cit> , the periodicity of somitogenesis is governed by a molecular oscillator that drives waves of gene expression caudal-rostrally through the psm. the evidence for cycling genes was first observed in the chick psm  <cit>  where c-hairy <dig> displays dynamic wave of mrna expression caudal-rostrally and has been subsequently extended to other species as zebrafish  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> . mice carrying mutations in genes encoding ligands, receptors or downstream effectors of the notch pathways display severe segmentation defects  <cit> . it is therefore believed that notch pathway is a crucial component of the vertebrate segmentation mechanism. indeed, known notch cycling genes in mammalian somitogenesis include: hes1/7/ <dig>  hey1/ <dig>  lfng, nkd <dig>  nrarp, maml <dig>  bcl9l <cit> . also the wnt signaling pathway is also rhythmically activated in the psm and reported cyclic genes from this pathway include axin <dig>  dact <dig>  dkk <dig>  sp <dig>  tnfrsf <dig>  myc, has <dig>  phlda <dig>  it has been reported that inactivation of wnt inhibitors such as dkk <dig>  results in segmentation defects  <cit> . other known cycling genes like spry2/ <dig>  dusp <dig>  shp <dig>  hspg <dig>  efna <dig>  bcl2l <dig> belong to the fgf family.

the details of the wave mechanism, the core pacemaker as well as the hierarchy between the components of notch, fgf and wnt and other pathways involved remain largely unknown. although all three pathways appear essential to proper functioning of the segmentation clock, there is no consensus whether the central oscillator is directly driven by periodic activation of the notch, wnt or fgf pathways, or, conversely, are these pathways regulated by an oscillator acting upstream of them . analysis of high-resolution gene expression profiles, including precise timing of gene expression may facilitate identification of further components of the network, causal relations between them as well as the transcriptional regulatory elements associated with each gene thus improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in somite formation. the segmentation clock is believed to be conserved between species; however some of the genes and regulations involved vary between the clades  <cit> . therefore, comparison between the process in different organisms may shed light on the evolution of the process, and allow identification of the most conserved, primordial aspects.

the activity of each of the three pathways is confined to a specific phase of the somite cycle. precisely timed transcriptional regulation plays a role in processes outside development, e.g. cell division, metabolic oscillation, biogenesis of organelles. tight confinement of transcription of genes to a specific time interval may be beneficial for several reasons. first, it allows compartmentalization in time and prevents interactions between incompatible biochemical processes  <cit> . second, by just-in-time transcription, the organism does not need to store and maintain proteins when they are not used. third, when the order of gene transcription follows the order of recruitment of subunits to a protein complex, proper assembly of the complex is facilitated  <cit> . it is therefore natural to postulate that in somitogenesis, the timing of gene expression will reflect the order in which the gene products enter their specific pathways. because causation cannot act backward in time, reconstructing the order of events is an important step towards uncovering the causal dependencies between the particular elements of a biological network. two traditional approaches to extracting the timeline of expression from timecourse experiments are: using the time of the highest measurement and computing the phase of the best-fit single harmonic wave. in the highest-peak method, the resolution is inherently limited to that of the source data, which is typically low due to the high cost of microarray experiments. the method is sensitive to experimental error or noise: just one bad measurement may result in drastically altering the timing result. the phase of the main fourier mode  <cit>  is more resistant to noise, without limiting the resolution; however, this will produce accurate results only if the data are well-approximated by a single sinusoid, which is often not the case.

the nature of microarray data, where the sample may contain subpopulations of cells in different states, or at different stages of the cycle, has allowed introduction of a new method, based on algebraic decomposition of the profile into a series of profiles for each of the sub-populations  <cit> . the measurement at a given time, m, is considered to be a sum of measurements for different samples: m = a1m1 + a2m2 + … + akmk. for a continuous family of sub-populations, that differ only by a time shift, the sum takes the form of an integral: m = ∫ ehdτ, where e is the true underlying profile, and h is the distribution of cycle phases among the cells in the experimental sample. it has been shown  <cit>  that as long as the probability distribution of time-shifts h is known, then by using a deconvolution algorithm based on prior probability derived from maximum entropy principle, one can solve this equation reconstructing the underlying source signal e with a resolution even  <dig> times better than that of the source data. the procedure automatically filters out most of the noise in the data because it favors regulations consistent with the underlying model h. here, we report a version of the method tailored to processes where the expression levels depend on both time and spatial coordinates.

over time, cells in every location along the psm pass through all phases of the somite cycle. moreover, at any given moment in time, cells in different positions along the psm will be in different phases of the cycle, as a consequence of the fact that the gene expression wave travels along the body axis. therefore, the experimental sample  will contain cells in different phases of the cycle, resulting in an artificially blurred expression profile. the present, spatiotemporal version of the deconvolution formalism is designed to compensate for this effect and computationally reconstruct the original profile, free from experimental artifacts. the fundamental difference between the temporal and spatiotemporal deconvolution lies in constructing the kernel  function. in the time deconvolution  <cit> , the kernel h was constructed based on the distribution of times, at which the cells enter the cycle. in the present, spatiotemporal case, h is derived from the known geometry of the embryo-sample system, and the velocity of the expression wave.

deconvolution in space and time thus allows reconstructing the underlying expression profile. knowing the profile, we are able to determine the time of peak expression of a gene with the resolution of several minutes, which is the time-scale at which the transcriptional regulation is optimized . we use the method to reconstruct the spatiotemporal expression profiles in mouse somitogenesis. peaks in the profiles precisely indicate the timing of gene regulation and their sequence reveals details of the finely-tuned regulatory network. as we shall see, the time of gene expression is tightly related to the time of activity of a gene’s product, even if further, posttranscriptional and posttranslational steps of regulation are required. we postulate that this prevalence of just-in-time expression  <cit>  allows the cell to economize on storage and maintenance of proteins not being used at a given time.

RESULTS
we have developed and implemented a dedicated suite of algorithms that assign the correct phase of the cycle to each data point, characterize the dependence between time, position and cycle phase, perform the deconvolution to reconstruct the full spatiotemporal profile, determine the phase of expression peak, and estimate the accuracy and resolution of the resulting timing . the algorithms applied to the data of  <cit>  and independently to the data from  <cit>  reveal and confirm the intricate sequence of transcriptional events associated with the somite cycle, which is the main result of the presented research.

accurate cycle phase for collected data points
previous analysis  <cit>  has assumed evenly spaced embryos along the clock cycle, which corresponds to an approximately 7 minute difference between consecutive time points in their data. instead of using this crude assumption, we use a three-step algorithm to infer the actual phase. first, we analyze the in-situ hybridization  images of  <cit>  to measure the position of the highest density of the lfng concentration. next, the position x is converted into an approximate phase φ using the formula x =  <dig> . <dig> derived from a model of wave propagation and its deceleration near the anterior end of the psm . the phases are further refined by powell optimization  <cit>  of periodicity scores of six strongly regulated benchmark genes ; see methods.

deconvolution algorithm
in somitogenesis gene expression studies, the mrna concentration is measured in a sample encompassing a large fraction of the psm. the sample contains cells in different phases of the somite cycle  and consequently each measurement can be represented as spatial convolution of the spatiotemporal profile at a given moment in time. the complete spatiotemporal profile of expression can be reconstructed if we assume that the expression e depends on the phase of the cycle, φ, which is in turn a function of time and position along the ap axis of the embryo. the reconstruction of the most likely spatiotemporal profile uses a prior distribution derived from the maximum-entropy principle and solves the integral equation through multidimensional optimization in the phase space . our implementation has been successfully applied to the data of  <cit>  and data of  <cit>  resulting in regular, high-resolution spatiotemporal profiles.

spatiotemporal profiles and peaks of regulated genes
we applied the spatiotemporal deconvolution algorithm to the gene expression data of  <cit> . these published data are genome-wide mrna concentrations in the tails of  <dig> mouse embryos at different stages of the oscillation generating a new somite. this dataset is based on the affymetrix genechip m0e430a microarray platform, which covers a large number of transcripts regulated during somitogenesis. krol et al.  <cit>  have subsequently collected a second data series in a similar experiment; here we will refer to it as “mouse-2”. we use the data of  <cit>  as the primary source of expression profiles, while the deconvolved profiles from mouse- <dig> <cit>  serve as independent validation experiment. figure  <dig> represents a comparison between original and deconvolved profiles using hes <dig>  hes <dig>  afprp <dig> and axin <dig> as examples. the timing of most notable genes, including previously known cyclic genes, is presented in table  <dig> and their expression profiles are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  all reported times are scaled assuming a 120-minute somite cycle, and relative to the beginning of the cycle defined as the moment when a new lfng band appears at the posterior end of the psm. the accuracy of timing is assessed for each individual gene using a monte-carlo simulation , the estimated median error of peak detection is 3 minutes.

times in minutes are scaled to a 120-minute somite cycle.

in the primary analysis of the results, we have considered only genes previously known to be involved in the process and used a peak detection algorithm for proper timing. the peaks of gene expression fall into two main time intervals. the first interval contains mostly genes from the wnt pathway and their activities are limited to the first 38 minutes of the process. those wnt genes may be regulated by beta-catenin  and include myc , axin <dig> , sp <dig> , dkk <dig> , has <dig> , tnfrsf <dig> , phlda <dig> , and dact <dig> .

the second interval, approximately between the 50th and 100th minutes of the cycle, marks the activity of the notch and fgf pathways. genes from the notch pathway, which are believed to be activated by notch <dig>  include nrarp , nkd <dig> , hey <dig> , hes <dig> , hes <dig> , lfng  and hes <dig> . examples from the fgf pathway include spry <dig> , egr <dig> , hspg <dig> , dusp <dig> , bcl2l <dig>  and shp <dig> . the separation between the two main phases confirms previous results suggesting that notch and fgf-related cyclic genes oscillate mostly in opposite phase to wnt  <cit> . moreover, genes in the notch pathway are regulated before the fgf pathway, suggesting that notch may be acting upstream of fgf. this difference is statistically significant at p =  <dig>   for peaks of the notch genes  preceding the fgf genes. this global picture remains unchanged when the expression times are derived from deconvolving the profiles from the mouse- <dig> dataset .

peak times follow causation in regulatory networks
knowing the directionality  of interactions is crucial for understanding of molecular and regulatory mechanisms underlying a biological process. spatiotemporal waves imply strict correspondence between time and position, and reversing order of events within a cycle is equivalent to reversing direction of traveling wave. in somitogenesis, it is almost impossible to reverse the direction of the wave through microsurgical manipulation, which proves that the paraxial mesoderm cells are endowed with the information for periodicity and directionality very early as they emerge after gastrulation  <cit> . here, we inferred the probable directions of causal interactions between genes based on the premise, that a gene that is active at a given moment in time can activate genes used shortly afterwards, but can never influence genes activated beforehand. given the cyclic nature of somitogenesis, we consider two genes as expressed one after another if their expression peaks appear within 45-minutes from one another. we have built a network of directionality based on expression timing and previously reported causal interactions  <cit>  between genes related to the wnt, notch and fgf pathways. the timing, statistical error and directions of causation are presented in figure  <dig>  where directionality could be inferred from data, we found approximately 87% agreement  between timing and previously reported causation, while only 13% are in the opposite order . approximately 14% of the gene interactions involved genes in opposite phases, defined by separation of over 45 minutes, for which causation could not be inferred .

the timing and directionality network establishes the hierarchy between wnt, notch and fgf signaling. the data indicate that wnt signaling is acting upstream of notch signaling. this wnt-notch directionality rule holds strictly for any regulation that may exist. this result confirm previous experiments showing that notch signaling oscillations depend on the intact and appropriate wnt signaling and suggest that the wnt signaling may be central to the segmentation clock mechanism  <cit> . although it is clear that notch and fgf signaling oscillate nearly in phase, the hierarchy between those pathways has remained an open question. our results strongly suggest that notch signaling is acting upstream of fgf. we also found that the fgf inhibitor, raf <dig>  is a bimodal gene with expression peaks at approximately 23 min and 91 min of the somite cycle suggesting also an fgf signaling activity just at the beginning of the somite cycle. assuming that the secondary peak of raf <dig> is responsible for the raf1-dusp <dig> interaction, the coincidence between causation and timing order will grow from 87% to 92%. also, the timing of egr <dig> has a relatively large uncertainty, and if we disregard its regulation by raf <dig>  the rate of agreement between timing and previously reported causation will reach 96%. in this analysis, we used all pairs of genes, with peaks separated by any interval smaller than 45 minutes. it can be argued, that causation in an exclusively transcriptional network requires a minimum time delay between two peaks of expression to of at least  <dig> – 20 minutes. taking this into account, and restricting the analysis to 12 min, which is reasonably sufficient for transcription and regulation, the rate of agreement is even higher and reaches 95%. note, however, that a direct transcriptional regulation between two genes is not required for just-in-time expression. it is possible, that both genes are regulated by a third process that has been evolutionary optimized to express them in a temporal sequence with a shorter interval.

for validation purposes, we analyzed the relation between causation and expression times according to the mouse- <dig> dataset. a comparison is represented in the additional file 3: figure s <dig> between the expression profiles from the data of dequeant et al.  and mouse- <dig>  using hes <dig>  dkk <dig>  axin <dig> as examples of genes with one peak of expression and arfrp <dig>  cnn <dig>  tmem <dig> as examples of genes with two peaks of expression. more generally, the rate of agreement between relative timing of causally connected genes in mouse- <dig> and mouse- <dig> is 95%. the agreement between mouse- <dig> and previously reported causation is 89%.

the early activation of ctnnb <dig> and the modulation of fgf8
β-catenin  is a transcriptional activator that regulates embryonic development as part of the wnt pathway and also plays a major role in the activation of genes in this pathway. it is also known that wnt is upstream of all signaling pathways known to oscillate in the mouse psm  <cit> . in the cytoplasm, β-catenin is an essential component of the wnt signaling pathway and is required for its function  <cit> . wnt activation in cells results in stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin, forming a feedback loop  <cit> . β-catenin also serves an important function in the nucleus. the nuclear beta-catenin interacts with tcf/lef proteins forming a transcription factor, which in turn activates the expression of the wnt genes  <cit> , which is consistent with the peak of β-catenin preceding the genes from the wnt pathway with a temporal delay allowing for the transcription and translation of these genes. aulehla et al.  <cit>  have also shown that wnt-signaling is dependent on a nuclear β-catenin protein gradient in the posterior psm.

those observations are all verified in our model in terms of causation as ctnnb <dig>  is activated early in the process and according to the timing, it activates successively myc , axin <dig> , dkk <dig> , sp <dig> , has <dig> , tnfrsf <dig> , phlda <dig> , and dact <dig> . it has been shown  <cit>  that somitogenesis is not disrupted by constitutive stabilization of β-catenin in an embryo. this observation does not however conflict with the observed peak of expression. most likely, while the presence of β-catenin is essential at a specific phase of the somite cycle, its absence in other phases is not required – and the observed pattern is an effect of evolutionary optimization or redundancy built into the system.

for many fgf genes, both a spatial gradient  <cit>  and an oscillatory behavior have been observed. this dual nature is not understood  <cit> . the overall gradient and its function in creating the determination front suggests that fgf acts upstream of wnt and notch, which also agrees with the cyclic nature of the process. fgf <dig> is a gene from the fgf family with multiple roles in development, including determination of the anteroposterior body axis, gastrulation, limb development as well as pattering of the face and the midbrain/hindbrain region  <cit> . the results of our analysis show modulation of the fgf <dig> transcript , which is surprising, because in the experiments of  <cit>  no production of new fgf <dig> mrna was observed in the psm. it is possible that the observed profile of fgf <dig> is a consequence of modulated degradation of fgf <dig> mrna. although the modulation may not be strictly transcriptional, it may still play a role in optimization of the somite formation process. our timing results show an expression peak of fgf <dig> which is later than the peaks of other fgf genes, and is nearly synchronous with the wnt pathway. fgf <dig> being active later than other genes in the pathway also agrees with wahl et al.  <cit> , who show that the expression of fgf <dig> depends of fgfr <dig>  and suggest that fgfr <dig> may directly influence the wnt and notch pathways. the relationship between fgf <dig> and other members of the fgf signaling pathway may be also related to the existence of a second peak for the fgf signaling inhibitor, raf <dig> 

expression of notch <dig> precedes notch-related cyclic genes
the activity of the notch-related cyclic genes depends on notch <dig>  whose periodic activation can be visualized via the rhythmic production of the notch intracellular domain . it is believed that after nuclear translocation, nicd activates transcription of target notch related genes. the process of somite formation was found to be delayed and disorganized in notch <dig> mutant embryos  <cit> , suggesting that this gene should coordinate the process or at least the notch signaling. consequently, we should expect activation of notch <dig> before all notch-related cyclic genes and that is actually the case, as shown in figure  <dig> 

notch <dig> is expressed approximately 53 min after the beginning of the somite cycle and then activates successively nkd <dig> , hey <dig> , nrarp , hes <dig> , lfng , hes <dig>  hes <dig>  and bcl9l . analysis of the mouse  <dig> dataset confirms these findings; notch <dig> peaks at 50 min and its targets between  <dig> and 90 minutes.

hes <dig> displays two peaks of expression
the role of the hes <dig> gene, and its zebrafish homologs her <dig> and her <dig>  has been extensively studied in the recent years. the primary function of hes <dig> in somitogenesis is related to its interaction with the notch modulator lfng  <cit> , which results in a wave of hes <dig> activity in phase with genes from the notch pathway. in the analysis of the deconvolved data, we have observed two peaks of expression of hes <dig> . the first peak at 71 min after the beginning of the somite cycle is consistent with the notch signaling activity and the hairy and enhancer of split family , and is exactly in phase with lfng. niwa et al.  <cit>  have discovered a secondary function of hes <dig>  related to its initiation by the fgf pathway. lfng knockout experiments suggest that these two pathways are largely independent from one another. this function is more consistent with the second peak of expression of hes <dig>  at 13 min after the beginning of the somite cycle. the bimodal expression pattern of hes <dig> is confirmed by the mouse- <dig> dataset, where the same pattern is observed consisting of two peaks, one following fgf and one in late notch phase.

raf <dig>  an fgf-related cyclic genes activator is bimodal
the timing of most known cyclic genes during mouse somitogenesis suggests the following relationship between signaling pathways: wnt acts upstream of notch, which in turns acts upstream of fgf. on the other hand, activities of some fgf signaling have been found to take place at the beginning of the process. moreover, several results  have suggested that cells in the posterior-most tissues are maintained undifferentiated by a high level of fgf signaling and activate their differentiation program only when they reach the appropriate threshold of fgf activity. although those observations can be related to the gradient of fgf <dig> creating the asymmetry along the rostral-caudal axis of the psm, another explanation may come from the bimodal behavior of raf <dig>  indeed, raf <dig> , which is known to regulate indirectly members of the fgf signaling pathway, was found to have two peaks of expression. the first expression peak of raf <dig>  which happens 23 min after the beginning of the somite cycle, can explain the regulation with some genes like tbxl <dig>  and fgf <dig> , while the second peak, 91 min after the beginning of the somite, is closer to the known fgf cyclic genes.

other bimodal genes
analysis of the timing of gene expression during mouse somitogenesis indicates that genes with multiple expression peaks may be involved. indeed, the dual peaks of expression of genes like hes <dig> and raf <dig> is obvious and may explain their role in the process.

in most studies on somitogenesis, attention is paid to genes with oscillation periods matching that of somite formation. although this is the most appropriate way to support the idea of the “clock and wavefront” model, studying genes with multiperiodicity or multifrequency can help understand some concepts behind the process. indeed, a transcript with 60-minutes period is also periodic within a 120 minutes process, but the 60-minutes periodicity will not produce a fourier peak a 120 minutes and such transcripts are often missed.

genes oscillating at different harmonic modes have been previously observed in cyclic processes. a prominent example is the cyclin-dependent kinase cdc <dig> with two peaks during the mitotic cycle  <cit> . examples in development include the recently reported two-segment periodicity in insect segmentation clock  <cit> : in the beetle tribolium casteneum, a short germ-band insect, the segmentation gene odd-skipped  oscillates with a two-segment periodicity, which shows that a multi-periodicity or half periodicity may occur during segmentation processes.

the bimodality of hes <dig> and raf <dig> suggests that other bimodal genes could be involved in the mouse somitogenesis. we used the previous ls algorithm with double frequency to find those genes whose period is half of that of somite formation. we detected  <dig> probe sets with a bimodal signal by setting the p-value, statistical significance level of testing the null hypothesis that a double peak in ls periodogram is due to chance, at  <dig> . after deconvolution, peak detection, error estimation and visual check of individual profiles, we ranked the genes according to the regularity of their profiles. the complete set of genes  found to be statistically significant with a regularly smooth profile is presented in the additional file 5: table s <dig> and the supporting website at http://moment.utmb.edu/somites. this set contains genes previously associated with wnt , notch  and fgf  pathways. the positions of peaks of the  <dig> bimodal genes along the somite cycle are shown in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  a majority of these genes have one peak of expression in the late wnt phase and the other one in the late notch/fgf phase.

table  <dig> contains the  <dig> most significant bimodal genes; their expression profile and timing are shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig> and additional file 8: figure s <dig> respectively. to our knowledge, none of these genes have been previously reported to have any critical function during mouse somitogenesis. arfrp <dig>  the gene with the most regular bimodal profile , has been reported to play a major role in such processes during early gastrulation as adhesion-dependent morphogenesis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and/or development of cell polarity and its deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality  <cit> . it should be noted that the bimodality is confirmed by the deconvolved data of  <cit>  as seen in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  we expect that the discovered bimodal profiles will lead to constructing more accurate models of somitogenesis and to finding new functions of the genes involved.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a variant of the maximum entropy deconvolution formalism that can describe spatiotemporally variable processes. our algorithm, supplemented with a customized method for data preprocessing, allowed the successful reconstruction of transcriptional events during mouse somitogenesis with a high accuracy and an unprecedented temporal resolution. the results demonstrate that the genes involved in the process are transcribed precisely when their products are needed, and that the timeline of gene expression agrees with the direction of causation in the regulatory network of somitogenesis. this strongly suggests that the temporal structure of the segmentation process is fully reflected by the timeline of transcriptional activity. the agreement holds even for genes with demonstrated posttranscriptional or posttranslational modifications, . a plausible explanation of such highly prevalent just-in-time expression is through the evolutionary pressure towards economizing on resources in the living cells – in predictable temporal processes a cell will conserve energy and amino acid components if a gene product is made just before it is needed, as opposed to long-time storage and maintenance of proteins. the deconvolution acting as a noise filter has revealed prominent peaks in the temporal profiles of many genes previously not annotated as cyclic , and for a number of transcripts two phases of activity have been identified per somite cycle . our findings are confirmed by applying the algorithms to a second independent dataset. although some differences exist between these two datasets, the ordering of causally-related genes is almost universally conserved.

the timeline of expression peaks will serve as a benchmark for newly identified causal interactions in somitogenesis, as well as a tool to generate and test further hypotheses concerning the regulatory network involved. our results demonstrate the utility of high-resolution timing of gene expression in deciphering the regulations in transcriptional networks in general.

the statistical and computational methods developed in this work are readily applicable to interpret the results of further gene expression studies of somitogenesis in mouse and other species as well as to other developmental processes.
