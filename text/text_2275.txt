BACKGROUND
injection drug user  populations throughout certain areas of europe and north america have become major risk groups associated with the epidemic spread of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus   <cit> . the transmission of mrsa clones through both community- and healthcare-associated routes is responsible for the high incidence of soft tissue infections and increases in severe infections such as endocarditis and bacteremia in idus  <cit> . such a clonal dispersal led to mrsa becoming endemic in the zurich idu population, where in  <dig> 24% of all mrsa isolates collected at the university hospital of zurich belonged to a single, so called "drug clone"  <cit> . dissemination of this clone to idu populations in other, geographically distinct regions of switzerland has also been recently reported, indicating that it has a capacity for spreading and colonizing new populations  <cit> .

clinical detection of mrsa can be complicated due to vast strain-to-strain differences in the expression of methicillin resistance. difficulties arise from strains expressing low-level but heterogenous resistance, that upon exposure to β-lactams segregate highly resistant subpopulations resulting in therapy failure  <cit> . misdiagnosis of such strains with very low, phenotypically susceptible, minimum inhibitory concentrations  is a major problem necessitating the use of molecular detection methods.

epidemiological classification of mrsa strains is important for monitoring their prevalence and spread, and relies on molecular typing of both their core genomic background and the type of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec  they harbour. sccmec is the chromosomally integrated resistance element which carries the meca gene, encoding the alternate penicillin-binding protein pbp2a, which confers methicillin resistance. there are currently six main types of sccmec, differentiated according to their combinations of mec complex, containing the meca gene and various portions of its regulatory genes mecr <dig> and meci, and ccr complex containing recombinases specific for the chromosomal integration and excision of the sccmec. further sub-typing is based on the presence of certain additional genes or resistance determinants within the j  regions j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig> of the element  <cit> . a number of non meca-encoding scc elements, sharing some common features with various sccmecs, have also been discovered in methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus  or coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains  <cit> .

identification of the zurich drug clone was based on a characteristic pulsed field gel smai restriction pattern and the presence of a unique, previously uncharacterised sccmec element which was termed sccmecn <dig>  in addition to methicillin resistance, all drug clone isolates were shown to be resistant to trimethoprim and most were resistant to sulfamethoxazole or to ciprofloxacin. mlst typing revealed that the representative isolate of this clone, mrsa che <dig>  belonged to sequence type st <dig>  a genotype that has been associated with epidemic mssa and low level oxacillin resistant mrsa, which seem to have high colonization and circulation capacities  <cit> .

all the drug clone isolates have low oxacillin resistance levels, with mics between  <dig>  and  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  which can make them difficult to detect by phenotypic tests. except for the detection of the meca gene, genotypic tests, which rely on identifying known features of sccmecs  <cit>  or sccmec-chromosomal junctions  <cit>  , have also failed to identify this clone  <cit> .

to facilitate accurate molecular identification of this clone this manuscript presents a detailed description of the novel sccmecn <dig> and describes the sccmec variability observed so far between different isolates.

RESULTS
mapping of sccmecn1
the size of sccmecn <dig> in che <dig> was estimated to be  <dig> -kb, based on a series of overlapping long range pcr products amplified with primers shown in figure  <dig> and listed in table  <dig>  this is larger than the community-associated sccmec type iv , type v  and type vi  elements, falling within the range of the classical hospital associated sccmec types i-iii which range in size from 34– <dig> kb  <cit> . loci of interest within sccmecn <dig> were then further mapped and sequenced.

mec complex typing
sccmec typing  <cit>  results suggested that the mec complex did not contain meci and pcr using primers spanning is <dig> and Δmecr <dig> and sequencing over the gene junction then confirmed the presence of a class b mec complex .

ccr typing
no ccr complex could be detected using the multiplex pcr for ccr types  <dig> to  <dig> as described by ito et al.  <cit> , however with ccr type 4-specific primers c <dig> and c <dig>  a weak amplificate was produced  <cit> . further sequence analysis revealed that this sccmec contained two complete ccrab loci which are both similar to ccrab <dig> from strain hde <dig>  a pediatric clone isolated in portugal carrying a type vi sccmec element  <cit> . therefore specific primers to identify the drug clone ccrab4-1/- <dig> genes were designed . one of the loci, ccrab4- <dig>  was located at the usual ccrab position downstream of the mec complex at the border of the j <dig> region. the other recombinase complex, ccrab4- <dig> was located within the j <dig> region . sequence alignments of ccrab4-1che <dig>  ccrab4-2che <dig>  ccrab4hde <dig> and ccrab4atcc <dig> genes showed that all four loci were different, with ccra <dig> genes sharing between  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity with each other and ccrb <dig> sequences sharing between  <dig> % and  <dig> % similarity. nucleotide sequence similarities of these four ccra <dig> genes and ccra genes from complex types 1– <dig>  and of the four ccrb <dig> genes with ccrb genes from complexes 1– <dig>  are shown by phylogenetic tree . for these alignments the sequence of ccrb4hde <dig> was adjusted because the database sequence is truncated as the result of an adenine deletion at nt position 1325; leaving it 99-aa shorter than ccrb4-1che <dig> and 100-aa shorter than ccrb4-2che <dig>  by adding back this adenine we could compare the whole length sequences.

the phylogenetic trees show that ccrab4-1che <dig>  ccrab4-2che <dig>  ccrab4hde <dig> and ccrab4atcc <dig>  form a distinct ccrab <dig> cluster. the presence of two complete ccrab <dig> loci in the che <dig> sccmec indicated that sccmecn <dig> had been composed from at least two different complete or partial scc elements. other such mosaic or composite scc elements have been described previously  <cit> , however this is the first sccmec found to contain two copies of the same ccr complex.

due to the presence of both a class b mec complex and ccrab <dig>  the che <dig> sccmec would be most closely related to sccmec type vi. however, due to a number of unique features, including the presence of a second ccr locus and additional antibiotic resistance determinants, it appears to be a distinct subtype of this group that we are provisionally calling sccmecn <dig> 

additional resistance determinants
in addition to meca, the resistance genes dfra and fusb <dig>  encoding trimethoprim and fusidic acid resistance, respectively, were also found on sccmecn <dig>  the dfra gene shared 100% nucleotide identity with dfra from psk <dig> , which confers high level trimethoprim resistance  <cit> . dfra is carried on tn <dig>  a generally plasmid-encoded composite transposon with the genetic organisation is431-rep-is431-orf140-dfra-thye-is <dig>  <cit> . we speculate that tn <dig> had jumped into the sccmec-associated is <dig>  hypothesised to be a hotspot for the integration of resistance determinants  <cit>  . however, it had lost the rep gene  and one of its flanking is <dig> elements, leaving tn <dig> truncated .

the fusb <dig> gene, found within the j <dig> region of sccmecn <dig>  was identical to the hypothetical fusidic acid resistance gene sas <dig> from the methicillin-susceptible strain mssa <dig>  <cit> , located on the  <dig> -kb scc-like element scc <dig>  in mssa <dig>  the scc <dig> ccrab genes, however, are most similar to the type  <dig> ccr complex from s. hominis. the fusb <dig> gene in che <dig> conferred only low level fusidic acid resistance of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> 

sccmec boundaries
the boundaries of the sccmec element were sequenced using the primers  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and compared to reference sequences of scc <dig> from mssa <dig> and sccmec type ii from n <dig> . sccmecn <dig> had integrated at the same position within the attbscc sequence at the 3' end of orfx as all previously described sccmec and scc elements. the ends of sccmecn <dig> contained the characteristic direct and degenerate-inverted repeats found at the ends of sccmec types i-iv and scc <dig>  integration site sequences  with the consensus sequence 5'-- <dig>  <cit>  were present at both boundaries. a third iss sequence  was also identified about  <dig> -kb upstream from the right end junction.

drug clone variability
analysis of pfge profiles of all drug clone isolates characterised by qi et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  revealed that there were small variations in size in the 208-kb smai band containing meca. therefore the sccmec of che <dig> and a selection of three other drug clone strains  were cured using plasmid psr3- <dig>  the smai band carrying sccmec was slightly larger in che <dig> and zh <dig> than in zh <dig> and zh <dig> before curing, whereas after curing the resulting patterns were identical in all four strains . this indicated that there was variability, presumably within the sccmec.

sccmecn <dig> variation
using the long range overlapping pcr products, variations in the sccmec elements of strains che <dig>  zh <dig>  zh <dig> and zh <dig>  were compared. fragment sizes between primers  <dig> and  <dig> varied by  <dig> to  <dig> bp, and between primers  <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the variation in the hypervariable region between the mec complex and Δtn <dig>  could be due to different numbers of direct repeats units   <cit>  as found in sccmec vt compared to the wis sccmec v  <cit> . amplification between fusb <dig> and the right sccmec junction produced a  <dig> -kb larger end fragment from che482/zh <dig> than from zh4/zh <dig> 

sequencing in from the right junctions showed that the ends of che482/zh <dig> were identical to each other with no significant similarity to any database sequences  but they were different to those of zh4/zh <dig> . the latter sequences of zh4/zh <dig> were identical to the end of scc <dig>  in contrast, the left end chromosome-sccmec junction sequences were identical in all drug clones analysed.

antibiotic resistance variability
sccmec variability also appeared to correlate with other strain differences. strains zh <dig> and zh <dig> which had identical sccmecs, were also both ciprofloxacin resistant; meanwhile che <dig> and zh <dig>  which share identical sccmecs, were ciprofloxacin susceptible . there was also variation in fusidic acid resistance levels. most strains had relatively low fusidic acid resistance. zh <dig>  however, was highly resistant and resistance was not lost upon curing , therefore resistance in this strain was probably additionally caused by a mutation in the chromosomal elongation factor g, ef-g   <cit> . since both ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole resistance are chromosomal, the sccmec variants found in the zurich drug clones are very likely associated with different, closely related genetic backgrounds.

abbreviations: fa, fusidic acid; fx, cefoxitin; na, not analysed; ox, oxacillin; tr, trimethoprim.

ccr activity
che <dig> was cured using either pme <dig>  or pme <dig> . resulting isolates were screened for methicillin, trimethoprim and fusidic acid susceptibility and for amplification of a pcr product spanning the former sccmec-chromosomal junctions . both ccrab4- <dig> and ccrab4- <dig> were functional and able to excise sccmec even though their ccra and ccrb amino acid sequences differed by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. this is consistent with the finding that several different ccrab loci from type iv sccmecs were all shown to be active, despite varying up to  <dig> % in their amino acid sequences  <cit> .

excision variants
che <dig> was cured using psr3- <dig>  <cit> , the resulting strain me <dig> was sensitive to oxacillin, fusidic acid and trimethoprim . during curing experiments with pme <dig> and pme <dig> we discovered that there were also many strains that had not been completely cured. one set of cured che <dig> variants maintained a fragment of  <dig> -kb, and sequencing confirmed that this fragment was the portion between the iss at the right junction and iss*. this indicated that excision of the main sccmec fragment containing all three resistance determinants had occurred through recombination between the iss at the left junction and iss*.

ccrab4- <dig> and its predicted promoter were also cloned into the e. coli-s. aureus shuttle vector paw <dig> to produce the recombinant plasmid pme <dig>  attempts to cure che <dig> of its sccmec element using pme <dig> resulted in another partially cured set of variants which had maintained fusidic acid resistance but lost oxacillin and trimethoprim resistance . analysis of these strains by pfge, showed that the sccmec-containing band had become smaller but not to the same extent as the completely cured strain me <dig> . these results indicated that only a portion of the sccmec, containing meca and dfra, had been lost. pcr mapping identified the location of the missing portion and sequencing over the excision sites revealed that excision was likely to be mediated by homologous recombination across regions of high nucleotide sequence similarity surrounding the two ccr loci, as no additional iss sequences were found. it appeared that recombination between the two ccr regions resulted in the deletion of a 22-kb fragment containing ccrab4- <dig>  the class b mec complex and Δtn <dig>  this recombination left an scc-like element of  <dig> -kb, which contained one ccrab complex  and the fusidic acid resistance determinant . this truncated scc is similar in size to the mssa <dig> scc <dig> which also contains fusb <dig> and a ccrab locus, although in scc <dig> the ccr genes are most similar to ccrab type  <dig> 

therefore we have identified three possible excision variants, two resulting from the presence of three iss, as has been seen in sccmec type iv strains  <cit> , and the third variant caused by recombination between regions of high sequence similarity.

CONCLUSIONS
the general structure of sccmecn <dig>  was distinctly different from already published sccmec types. several regions of variability were found between different clinical drug clone isolates, especially in the right-end region where the presence or absence of a dna fragment framed by iss sequences was detected. nevertheless this clone can now be identified by its resistance profile and its combination of class b mec complex and ccrab <dig> complex sequences, thus allowing easier epidemiological identification.

materials and methods
bacterial strains and growth conditions
bacterial strains and plasmids are listed in table  <dig>  the four clinical mrsa isolates che <dig>  zh <dig>  zh <dig> and zh <dig> were clones associated with intravenous drug users in the zurich area. apart from the type strain che <dig>  strains were selected from the epidemiological study in  <dig> based on their pfge patterns and resistance profiles   <cit> . growth was at 37°c in luria bertani broth . strains harbouring the temperature-sensitive plasmids pme <dig> or pme <dig> were propagated at 30°c in the presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> tetracycline and those with plasmid pme <dig> were grown at 37°c in the presence of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin.

susceptibility testing
the minimal inhibitory concentrations  of antibiotics were determined by etest on mueller-hinton agar plates  according to the manufacturer's instructions . disc diffusion of oxacillin, cefoxitin, fusidic acid and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were done according to clsi  <cit>  on mueller hinton agar plates. penicillinase production of cefoxitin-induced cells was assayed by nitrocefin hydrolysis and pbp2a production by the mrsa screen agglutination test from denka seiken   <cit> .

sccmec typing
sccmec types i through iv, ccr types  <dig> to  <dig>  and ccr type  <dig> from the pediatric clone hde <dig>  were identified by pcr as described by  <cit> , and  <cit> , respectively. a specific pcr was established to identify the drug clone ccrab4-1/-2che <dig> using primer pair  <dig> and  <dig> .

localization of dfra and meca
smai digested chromosomal dna was separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, pfge  <cit>  and hybridised sequentially  <cit>  with a meca  and a dfra probe  .

cloning of the ccrab genes of che482
each of the two ccrab complexes identified in strain che <dig>  including their own promoter, were cloned into the bamhi site of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pyt <dig>  using primers  <dig> and  <dig> for ccrab4-1che <dig> and primers  <dig> and  <dig> for ccrab4-2che <dig>  the resulting plasmids pme <dig> and pme <dig>  respectively, were electroporated into rn <dig> and then transduced by Φ80α into the mrsa clinical isolates to be cured of sccmec. the ccrab4-1che <dig> was also cloned into the e. coli-s. aureus shuttle vector paw <dig>  using the primers  <dig> and  <dig> . the resulting plasmid pme <dig> was then electroporated into rn <dig> and transduced into the mrsa to be cured of sccmec.

curing of sccmec
curing of sccmec was done by the method of katayama  <cit>  using either the temperature-sensitive plasmid psr3- <dig> containing ccrab type  <dig> recombinase genes, or plasmids pme <dig>  or pme <dig> . curing with plasmid pme <dig>  was done by transducing the plasmid into the clinical mrsa isolates, selecting for kanamycin resistant transductants at 37°c, which were then pooled and plated on lb agar containing kanamycin, grown overnight, and screened by replica plating for loss of oxacillin resistance on  <dig> μg ml- <dig> oxacillin.

sequence analysis
sequencing was performed with an abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit  and an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer . sequence assembly was accomplished using the dnastar sequence analysis package .

sequencing of the sccmec-chromosome junctions of four drug clones was done by direct chromosomal sequencing  <cit>  of the original and cured clones using primer  <dig>  this nucleotide sequence provided the template for the design of primers  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  over the chromosome-sccmec junctions.

mapping of sccmec
to estimate the size of the che <dig> sccmec, long range pcr amplification of six main fragments was performed using the polymerase takara ex taq . pcr was done as described by the manufacturer's recommendation. primer pairs utilised were:  <dig> and 5;  <dig> and 6;  <dig> and 8;  <dig> and 9;  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> . amplified pcr fragments were run against molecular weight markers  on a  <dig> % agarose gel.
