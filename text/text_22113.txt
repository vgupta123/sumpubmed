BACKGROUND
several groups have developed potential therapeutics that produce highly selective lesions in vivo by exploiting specific g-protein coupled receptors  as transporters to deliver a toxin to an intracellular target  <cit> . when gpcrs bind a peptide agonist they are internalized by the cell; delivering the peptide, and any attached toxin, to the inside of the cell  <cit> . the toxin is then able to act on its intracellular target. some of these investigators have used lethal toxins such as saporin, diphtheria and pseudomonas exotoxin coupled to the neuropeptide substance p to target the agents to cells expressing neurokinin receptors  <cit> . these toxins produce highly specific lesions of neurokinin receptor expressing cells while not harming cells in the region that do not express these receptors. the investigators have also demonstrated by ablating these cells that neurons expressing the nk <dig> receptor in the spinal cord are required for central sensitization. thus, these targeted toxins were found to be valuable tools for evaluating the function of neurons in the central nervous system  <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that these targeted toxins may have clinical utility for the treatment of intractable pain.

in an effort to compliment the armamentarium of targeted toxins we sought to selectively activate, rather than kill, neurokinin receptor expressing cells by coupling cholera toxin to the neuropeptide substance p. cholera toxin, unlike previously used toxins, is not universally lethal to the cells. the toxin is useful because it adp ribosylates the g-protein gs, which results in the uncoupling of the protein from gpcrs and activation of the g-protein  <cit> . cholera toxin activation of gs stimulates adenylate cyclase activity to produce higher levels of camp in the cells, altered protein kinase activity and altered ion channel activity  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that a conjugate of substance p and the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin  would selectively activate neurokinin receptor expressing neurons and would provide a novel tool for evaluating cell function in vivo.

RESULTS
synthesis of sp-cta
the neuropeptide substance p was coupled to the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin  using the bifunctional linking agent sulfosuccinimidyl 4-n-maleimidomethyl cyclohexane-1-carboxylate  as indicated in figure 1a. briefly, the sulfo-smcc was reacted with the n-terminal amine of substance p to form an amide linkage to the maleimide group. the substance p – maleimide was then conjugated to cta through two cysteine residues in the c-terminal region of the cta protein. the final product was washed and concentrated by centrifugation in centricon filters with a cutoff of  <dig> kd. the success of the synthesis was confirmed on western blots by using antibodies to both substance p and cta. as demonstrated in figure 1b the final product produced bands on the western blot with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kd that reacted with antibodies to substance p and cta indicating a successful coupling of substance p to cta . based on protein assays the synthetic yields were quantitative. in preliminary syntheses bands for substance p and cta in the western blots were doublets. increasing the concentration of substance p in the reaction produced a single band at the higher molecular weight suggesting that the stoichiometry of substance p to cta in the final product was 2: <dig> 

in situ evaluation of sp-cta
sp-cta was tested on chinese hamster ovary cells that were stably transfected with the nk <dig> receptor  <cit>  . to verify selective uptake of sp-cta by the cells, the cells were incubated over night in either sp-cta  or cta . the cho-nk <dig> cells were then fixed and prepared for immunocytochemistry with antibodies to cta using a rhodamine-tyramide amplification system. as illustrated in figure 2a only the sp-cta treated cells demonstrated an uptake of cta indicating that linkage of cta to substance p was required for the conjugate to be internalized.

we further evaluated the functionality of the sp-cta by examining the ability of the conjugate to stimulate camp production in cho-nk <dig> cells. figure 2b demonstrates the concentration response relationship for sp-cta  to  <dig>  ng/ml ) when the sp-cta was applied for  <dig> hour and the camp was measured after culturing the cells for an additional  <dig> hours. the time course of sp-cta's effect on camp production was evaluated by treating the cells for  <dig> hour with  <dig> ng/ml sp-cta and then harvesting the cells for camp analysis  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days following exposure to the conjugate. as demonstrated in figure 2c, sp-cta's effects on camp peaked at  <dig> day in the cho-nk <dig> cells and remained significantly elevated for  <dig> days.

to evaluate the relative selectivity of sp-cta for nk <dig>  nk <dig> and nk <dig> receptors, cho cells were transfected with nk <dig> or nk <dig> plasmids and a concentration response relationship was performed on sp-cta's ability to stimulate camp production. as demonstrated by figure  <dig>  cells containing nk <dig> or nk <dig> receptors demonstrated equivalent concentration response relationships when measuring levels of camp stimulation by sp-cta. however, in cho cells not expressing neurokinin receptors or cho cells stably expressing nk <dig> receptors sp-cta did not stimulate camp production .

in vivo evaluation of sp-cta
previous work with lethal toxins coupled to substance p demonstrated that neurons expressing nk <dig> receptors are necessary for the expression of thermal hyperalgesia  <cit> . therefore it was hypothesized that uptake of sp-cta by nk <dig> receptor expressing neurons in the spinal cord would stimulate the cells and produce thermal hyperalgesia. initially, a group of  <dig> rats received intrathecal injections of  <dig> μg of sp-cta. one hour later the spinal cords were harvested and prepared for immunohistochemistry to determine if the sp-cta was taken up by nk <dig> receptor expressing neurons. figure 4a demonstrates that the conjugate co-labels with nk <dig> receptors in the superficial layers of the spinal cord. to test the idea that sp-cta would stimulate the neurons that have taken up the conjugate rats were injected intrathecally with sp-cta , cta  or saline  . twenty four hours following the injection of sp-cta, but not cta, the animals were agitated and aggressive toward their cage mates. the animals were euthanized by pentobarbital overdose and prepared for immunohistochemistry of the spinal cords to evaluate the phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein  and the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos. we chose to examine creb because elevated levels of camp lead to the phosphorylation of this transcription factor  <cit> . we found that sp-cta treatment resulted in a large increase in the phosphorylation of creb in the spinal cord dorsal horn , while the injection of cta produced levels of phosphorylated creb that were similar to saline injected animals. in addition to elevated levels of phosphorylated creb we found that c-fos was also enhanced in sp-cta treated animals .

a dose response relationship and time course was determined for sp-cta using the hind paw thermal nociception assay of hargreaves et al.  <cit> . figure 6a demonstrates that intrathecally administered sp-cta  has a biphasic dose response relationship  <dig> hours following the injections with peak thermal hyperalgesia observed at a dose of approximately  <dig> μg . at  <dig> μg of sp-cta the animals demonstrated agitated behaviors similar to the first group that received  <dig> μg; therefore, no higher doses were tested. finally, to determine the time course of action of sp-cta  <dig> μg was injected intrathecally  and thermal nociception was tested before injections and  <dig> to  <dig> days following the injection. as illustrated in figure 6b the peak of thermal hyperalgesia occurred  <dig> day following the injection. some recovery occurred over the next three days; however, a complete return to baseline paw withdrawal thresholds was not observed.

discussion
previously used lethal toxins targeted to gpcrs via coupling to a peptide agonist were useful for evaluating the function of the cells that expressed the gpcrs. by using the receptor to direct the toxins to the desired cell type the agents produced highly specific lesions, even when the targeted cells were a minor constituent of a heterogeneous population of cells  <cit> . however, because these toxins kill the targeted cells, the cells' function must be inferred by the deficit that is produced by the lesion. ideally, a method to selectively stimulate the cells could provide more information about the cells' function. to achieve this goal we coupled the neuropeptide substance p, which targets neurokinin receptors  <cit> , to the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin . cholera toxin is not lethal when taken up by cells, but it does enhance the activity of adenylate cyclase resulting in an increase in intracellular camp  <cit> . thus, by targeting cholera toxin to neurokinin receptor bearing neurons with substance p we altered the function of these cells rather than killing them.

we found that sp-cta produced equivalent effects on camp production in cultured cells expressing nk <dig> or nk <dig> receptors, but did not influence camp production in cells that expressed nk <dig> receptors or non-transfected cells. these data suggest that the conjugate binds to nk <dig> and nk <dig> receptors with approximately the same affinity. takeda and colleagues previously demonstrated that substance p had a ten fold higher affinity for nk <dig> than nk <dig> receptors  <cit> . it is possible that the presence of cta on the n terminus of substance p reduces the nk <dig> selectivity of the peptide. alternatively, since we used a functional assay, any affinity differences between the receptors may have been obscured by uptake mechanisms and by the action of the toxin on gs. for example, the association rate of substance p is much higher for nk <dig> than nk <dig> receptors  <cit> . because of the higher binding rate the nk <dig> receptors may be internalized faster than the nk <dig> receptors. however, if the nk <dig> receptors do not rapidly recycle to the cell surface the nk <dig> receptors will eventually bind and internalize an equal amount of sp-cta. thus our functional assay would negate the differences in binding affinity of substance p for the nk <dig> and nk <dig> receptors. additionally, because cholera toxin stimulates camp production and protein kinase a activity it is possible that due to excessive phosphorylation the neurokinin receptors are trapped in the internalized state making the receptors unavailable to transport more toxin. this process could also mask any binding affinity differences.

in vivo our data demonstrate that when sp-cta was injected intrathecally in rats the animals became hypersensitive to thermal stimuli . this data supports the previous lesion studies indicating that central sensitization is mediated by nk <dig> receptor expressing neurons in the spinal cord  <cit> . we further found that with higher doses of sp-cta peripheral sensitivity was suppressed . however, the animals demonstrated behaviors that suggested centrally mediate nociception. we hypothesize that the suppression of peripheral hypersensitivity was due to stimulation of inhibitory pathways by the nk <dig> receptor expressing neurons that have taken up the sp-cta. these inhibitory systems may be previously characterized descending inhibitory pathways  <cit>  or local inhibitory neurons. further work should clarify this finding. these data, however, support the idea that selectively stimulating cells provides unique information on their function that is not available when a lesioning strategy is used. what is most notable about these results is that the inhibition of peripheral nociception could not have been predicted from several previous lesioning studies  <cit> . however, when specifically examining descending inhibition suzuki and colleagues' found that lesioning of nk <dig> expressing neurons in the spinal cord suppressed peripheral afferent stimulated descending inhibition  <cit> , which is consistent with our findings.

the effects of intrathecally administered sp-cta also contrast with the effects produced by intrathecal wild type cholera toxin. in a previous study wild type cholera toxin inhibited the hyperalgesia and allodynia produced by a variety of peripheral injuries  <cit> . the inhibitory effect of the toxin was blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. the mechanism that produced this endogenous opioid mediated inhibition of nociception was not investigated, but work by shen and crain indicates that cholera toxin can enhance the inhibitory effects of opioids on primary afferent neurons  <cit> . thus, it can be hypothesized that wild type cholera toxin acts principally on primary afferent neurons to inhibit peripherally mediated nociception; while sp-cta affects nk <dig> receptor expressing spinothalamic tract neurons to generate centrally mediated nociception.

CONCLUSIONS
we have synthesized a novel tool for activating adenylate cyclase in neurokinin receptor expressing cells to evaluate the function of these cells in heterogeneous populations, as are typically found in vivo. intrathecal injections of sp-cta in rats demonstrated that the toxin conjugate produced thermal hyperalgesia as would be expected if nk <dig> receptor expressing spinothalamic tract neurons were sensitized by the treatment. these data indicate that gpcrs can be exploited to transport cholera toxin into a host of different cell types. because the toxin is targeted to the gpcr by a peptide agonist it is remarkably simple to change the peptide to direct the conjugate to receptors other than neurokinin receptors. these targeted cholera toxin conjugates could find utility in a number of biomedical research endeavors.
