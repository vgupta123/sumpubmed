BACKGROUND
animals learn to control their environment through instrumental  conditioning. when an animal acts to obtain reward or reinforcement, there is often a delay between its action and the outcome; thus, animals must learn instrumental action-outcome contingencies using delayed reinforcement. although such delays impair learning, animals can nevertheless bridge substantial delays to acquire instrumental responses  <cit> . little is known of the neural basis of this process. however, abnormalities in learning from delayed reinforcement may be of considerable clinical significance  <cit> . impulsivity is part of the syndrome of many psychiatric disorders, including mania, drug addiction, antisocial personality disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  <cit> . impulsive choice, one aspect of impulsivity  <cit> , is exemplified by the tendency to choose small rewards that are available immediately instead of larger rewards that are only available after a delay  <cit> , and may reflect dysfunction of reinforcement learning systems mediating the effects of delayed rewards  <cit> .

the nucleus accumbens  responds to anticipated rewards in humans, other primates, and rats  <cit> , and is innervated by dopamine  neurons that respond to errors in reward prediction in a manner appropriate for a teaching signal  <cit> . the acb may therefore represent a reinforcement learning system specialized for learning with delayed reinforcement  <cit> . if this is the case, then damage to the acb should not interfere with reinforcement learning in all circumstances, but should produce selective impairments in learning when reinforcement is delayed. this prediction has not previously been tested. however, lesions of the acbc cause rats to prefer small immediate rewards  to large delayed rewards ; that is, acbc-lesioned rats exhibit impulsive choice  <cit> . the reason for this is not clear. it might be that acbc-lesioned rats exhibit steeper temporal discounting, such that the subjective utility  of future rewards declines more rapidly than normal as the reward is progressively delayed  <cit> . it might also be that acbc-lesioned rats are less good at representing the contingency between actions and their outcomes when the outcomes are delayed, so that they choose impulsively because they are less certain or less aware that their choosing the delayed reward does in fact lead to that reward being delivered  <cit> . both explanations would reflect a problem in dealing with delayed reinforcement in acbc-lesioned rats. however, there might be a simpler explanation for the impulsive choice exhibited by acbc-lesioned rats: they might perceive the size  of rewards differently. for example, if they do not perceive the delayed reward to be as large, relative to the immediate reward, as normal rats did, then they might choose impulsively despite processing the delays to reward normally, simply because the delayed reinforcer is not subjectively large enough to compensate for the normal effects of the delay  <cit> .

to investigate whether the acbc is a reinforcement learning system specialized for delayed reinforcement, we first determined the ability of acbc-lesioned rats to detect instrumental contingencies across a delay. the ability of acbc-lesioned rats to acquire instrumental responding with delayed reinforcement was compared to that of sham-operated controls; each subject was allowed to respond freely on two levers, one of which produced reinforcement after a delay of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> s . we report that acbc lesions only retarded instrumental learning when reinforcement was delayed, demonstrating a role for the acbc in bridging action-outcome delays during learning. subsequently, to establish whether acbc-lesioned rats perceive reward magnitude abnormally, we assessed these subjects' sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude by measuring their relative preference for two different reinforcers using concurrent interval schedules of reinforcement. we report that reinforcer magnitude discrimination in acbc-lesioned rats in this task was at least as good as in sham-operated controls, consistent with previous evidence of reinforcer magnitude discrimination following lesions of the whole acb e.g.  <cit> . together, these results suggest that the impulsive choice seen in acbc-lesioned rats  <cit>  is due to a problem in processing delayed reward, not in processing the magnitudes of the reward alternatives. finally, to establish whether the acbc is required for the performance of an instrumental response for delayed reinforcement, as well as for the learning of such a response, we trained naïve rats to respond for delayed reinforcement  before destroying the acbc. we report that such lesions also impaired performance of a previously-learned instrumental response only when reinforcement was delayed, indicating that the acbc makes an enduring contribution to bridging delays between subjects' actions and the ensuing outcomes.

RESULTS
in experiment  <dig>  rats received excitotoxic lesions of the acbc or sham lesions, and were then tested on an instrumental free-operant acquisition task with delayed reinforcement  and subsequently a reinforcer magnitude discrimination task . in experiment  <dig>  naïve rats were trained on the free-operant task for delayed reinforcement; acbc lesions were then made and the rats were retested.

histology
in experiment  <dig>  there were two postoperative deaths. histological analysis revealed that the lesions were incomplete or encroached significantly on neighbouring structures in four subjects. these subjects were excluded; final group numbers were therefore  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . in experiment  <dig>  one rat spontaneously fell ill with a colonic volvulus during preoperative training and was killed, and there were three postoperative deaths. lesions were incomplete or too extensive in seven subjects; final group numbers were therefore  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

lesions of the acbc encompassed most of the core subregion; neuronal loss and associated gliosis extended in an anteroposterior direction from approximately  <dig>  mm to  <dig>  mm anterior to bregma, and did not extend ventrally or caudally into the ventral pallidum or olfactory tubercle. damage to the ventromedial caudate-putamen was occasionally seen; damage to acbsh was restricted to the lateral edge of the dorsal shell. schematics of the lesions are shown in figure  <dig>  photomicrographs of one lesion are shown in figure  <dig>  and are similar to lesions with identical parameters that have been presented before  <cit> .

acquisition of instrumental responding 
the imposition of response-reinforcer delays retarded the acquisition of free-operant lever pressing, in sham-operated rats and in acbc-lesioned rats . acbc-lesioned rats responded slightly more than shams on both the active and inactive levers in the absence of response-reinforcers delays, but when such delays were present, acbc lesions retarded acquisition relative to sham-operated controls .

an overall anova using the model lesion <dig> × delay <dig> ×  revealed multiple significant interactions, including lever × delay × lesion  and session × lever × delay , justifying sub-analysis. all six groups learned to respond more on the active lever than the inactive lever .

for sham-operated rats, delays reduced the rate of acquisition of the active lever response and reduced the asymptotic level of responding attained . the presence of a delay also increased responding on the inactive lever slightly , though not systematically .

there was a further, delay-dependent impairment in acbc-lesioned rats, who responded more than shams at  <dig> s delay but substantially less than shams at  <dig> s and  <dig> s delay. as in the case of sham-operated controls, delays reduced the rate of acquisition and the maximum level of responding attained in acbc-lesioned rats . responding on the inactive lever was not significantly affected by the delays . at  <dig> s delay, acbc-lesioned subjects responded more than shams on the active lever  and the inactive lever . however, at  <dig> s delay, acbc-lesioned rats responded significantly less than shams on the active lever ; there was no difference in responding on the inactive lever . at  <dig> s delay, again, acbc-lesioned rats responded significantly less than shams on the active lever  and there was no difference in responding on the inactive lever .

experienced response-delivery and response-collection delays 
for every reinforcer delivered, the active lever response most closely preceding it in time was identified, and the time between that response and delivery of the reinforcer  was calculated. this time can therefore be equal to or less than the programmed delay, and is only relevant for subjects experiencing non-zero programmed response-reinforcer delays. the response-to-reinforcer-collection  delays were also calculated: for every reinforcer delivered, the response most closely preceding it and the nosepoke most closely following it were identified, and the time between these two events calculated. this time can be shorter or longer than the programmed delay, and is relevant for all subjects.

acbc-lesioned rats experienced the same response-delivery delays as shams when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, but experienced longer response-delivery delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s . similarly, acbc-lesioned rats experienced the same response-collection delays as shams when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, slightly but not significantly longer response-collection delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, and significantly longer response-collection delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s . these differences in the mean delay experienced by each rat were reflected in differences in the distribution of response-delivery and response-collection delays when the programmed delay was non-zero . since acbc-lesioned rats experienced slightly longer delays than sham-operated rats, it was necessary to take this into account when establishing the effect of delays on learning, as follows.

effect of delays on learning 
there was a systematic relationship between the acquisition rate and the programmed delay of reinforcement, and this was altered in acbc-lesioned rats. figure 7a replots the rates of responding on the active lever on session  <dig> of acquisition  <cit> . despite the comparatively low power of such an analysis, lever-pressing was analysed for this session only using the model lesion <dig> × delay <dig>  this revealed a significant lesion × delay interaction , which was analysed further. increasing delays significantly reduced the rate of responding in this session for shams  and acbc-lesioned rats . acbc-lesioned rats responded more than shams at zero delay  but less than shams at  <dig> s delay  and at  <dig> s delay .

since the acbc group experienced slightly longer response-delivery and response-collection delays than shams when the programmed delay was non-zero , it was important to establish whether this effect alone was responsible for the retardation of learning, or whether delays retarded learning in acbc-lesioned rats over and above any effect to increase the experienced delay. the mean experienced response-collection delay was calculated for each subject, up to and including session  <dig>  the square-root-transformed number of responses on the active lever in session  <dig> was then analysed using a general linear model of the form lesion <dig> × experienced delaycov. unlike a standard analysis of covariance, the factor × covariate interaction term was included in the model. this confirmed that the lesion retarded the acquisition of responding in acbc-lesioned rats, compared to controls, in a delay-dependent manner, over and above the differences in experienced delay .

experienced delays and learning on the inactive lever 
no such delay-dependent effects were observed for the inactive lever. experienced inactive-response-delivery delays  were much longer and more variable than corresponding delays for the active lever, because subjects responded on the inactive lever so little. means ± sems were  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s , and  <dig> ±  <dig> s . anova of these data revealed no effects of lesion or programmed delay and no interaction . experienced inactive-response-collection delays were  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s ,  <dig> ±  <dig> s , and  <dig> ±  <dig> s . again, anova revealed no effects of lesion or programmed delay and no interaction . when the square-root-transformed number of responses on the inactive lever in session  <dig> was analysed with the experienced delays up to that point as a predictor, using the model lesion <dig> × experienced inactive-response-collection delaycov just as for the active lever analysis, there was no lesion × experienced delay interaction .

discrimination of relative reinforcer magnitude 
relative preference for two reinforcers may be inferred from the distribution of responses on concurrent variable interval schedules of reinforcement  <cit> . according to herrnstein's matching law  <cit> , if subjects respond on two concurrent schedules a and b delivering reinforcement at rates ra and rb respectively, they should allocate their response rates ra and rb such that ra/ = ra/. overmatching is said to occur if subjects prefer the schedule with the higher reinforcement rate more than predicted by the matching law; undermatching is the opposite. both sham-operated and acbc-lesioned rats were sensitive to the distribution of reinforcement that they received on two concurrent random interval  schedules, altering their response allocation accordingly. subjects preferred the lever on which they received a greater proportion of reinforcement. in general, subjects did not conform to the matching law, but exhibited substantial undermatching; this is common  <cit> . acbc-lesioned rats exhibited better matching  than shams , suggesting that their sensitivity to the relative magnitudes of the two reinforcers was as good as, or better than, shams'.

to analyse these data, the proportion of pellets delivered by lever a , and the proportion of responses allocated to lever a, were calculated for each subject for the last session in each of the three programmed reinforcement distribution contingencies . the analysis used a model of the form response proportion = lesion <dig> × ; the factor × covariate term was included in the model. analysis of sham and acbc groups separately demonstrated that both groups altered their response allocation according to the distribution of reinforcement, i.e. that both groups discriminated the two reinforcers on the basis of their magnitude . there was also a significant lesion × reinforcer distribution interaction , indicating that the two groups' matching behaviour differed, with the acbc-lesioned rats showing better sensitivity to the relative reinforcer magnitude than the shams . these statistical conclusions were not altered by including counterbalancing terms accounting for whether lever a was the left or right lever , or whether a given rat had been trained with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> s delays in experiment 1a.

switching behaviour during concurrent schedule performance 
because switching behaviour has the potential to influence behaviour on concurrent schedules e.g.  <cit> , we also analysed switching probabilities. acbc-lesioned rats were less likely than shams to switch between levers when responding on two identical concurrent ri schedules with a changeover delay  of  <dig> s. responses on the left and right levers were sequenced for sessions 8– <dig> , and the probabilities of switching from one type of response to another, or repeating the same type of response, were calculated. the switch probabilities were analysed by one-way anova; this revealed an effect of lesion . mean switch probabilities  were  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

effects of acbc lesions on performance of a previously-learned instrumental response for delayed reinforcement 
due to mechanical faults, data from four subjects in session  <dig>  and data from one subject in session  <dig>  were not collected. both sessions were removed from analysis completely, and data points for those sessions are plotted using the mean and sem of the remaining unaffected subjects .

preoperatively, the groups remained matched following later histological selection. analysis of the last  <dig> preoperative sessions, using the model lesion intent <dig> × delay <dig> × , indicated that responding was affected by the delays to reinforcement , but there were no differences between the groups due to receive acbc and sham lesions . as expected, delays reduced the rate of responding on the active lever  and increased responding on the inactive lever  preoperatively.

acbc lesions selectively impaired performance of instrumental responding only when there was a response-reinforcer delay. there was no effect of the lesion on responding under the  <dig> s delay condition, but in the presence of delays, acbc lesions impaired performance on the active lever . these conclusions were reached statistically as follows.

subjects' responding on the relevant lever in the last preoperative session  was used as a covariate to increase the power of the analysis  <cit> . as expected, there were no significant differences in the covariates themselves between groups due to receive acbc or sham surgery . analysis of the postoperative sessions, using the model lesion <dig> × delay <dig> × , revealed a near-significant lesion × delay × session × lever interaction . furthermore, analysis of postoperative responding on the active lever, using the model lesion <dig> × delay <dig> × , revealed a session × delay × lesion interaction  and a delay × lesion interaction , indicating that the lesion affected responding on the active lever in a delay-dependent manner. in an identical analysis of responding on the inactive lever , no terms involving lesion were significant , indicating that the lesion did not affect responding on the inactive lever.

postoperatively, response-reinforcer delays continued systematically to decrease responding on the active lever, both in shams  and in acbc-lesioned rats . shams continued to discriminate between the active and inactive lever at all delays . acbc-lesioned rats continued to discriminate at  <dig> s and  <dig> s , but acbc-lesioned subjects in the  <dig> s condition failed to discriminate between the active and inactive levers postoperatively .

lesioned subjects responded as much as shams at  <dig> s delay, but substantially less than shams at  <dig> s and  <dig> s delay . again, analysis was conducted using responding on the relevant lever in session  <dig>  as a covariate. at  <dig> s, the lesion did not affect responding on the active lever . however, at  <dig> s, acbc-lesioned rats responded significantly less than shams on the active lever . similarly, at  <dig> s, acbc-lesioned rats responded less than shams on the active lever . there were no differences on responding on the inactive lever at any delay .

experienced response-delivery and response-collection delays 
as in experiment  <dig>  acbc-lesioned rats experienced the same response-delivery delays as shams when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, but experienced longer response-delivery delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s . similarly, acbc-lesioned rats experienced the same response-collection delays as shams when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, slightly but not significantly longer response-collection delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s, and significantly longer response-collection delays when the programmed delay was  <dig> s .

relationship between experienced delays and performance 
there was a systematic relationship between the postoperative response rate and the programmed delay of reinforcement, and this was altered in acbc-lesioned rats. figure 12a replots the rates of lever-pressing on session  <dig>  the 10th postoperative session . an analysis using the model lesion <dig> × programmed delay <dig> revealed a significant lesion × delay interaction . in this session, there was no significant effect of delays on shams' performance , though there was for acbc-lesioned rats . there were no significant differences in responding on this session between shams and acbc-lesioned rats in the  <dig> s condition  or the  <dig> s condition , but acbc-lesioned rats responded less at  <dig> s delay .

since the acbc group experienced slightly longer response-delivery and response-collection delays than shams when the programmed delay was non-zero , as before, the rate of responding in session  <dig> was analysed as a function of the delays experienced postoperatively. the mean experienced response-collection delay was calculated for postoperative sessions up to and including session 24; the square-root-transformed number of lever presses in session  <dig> was then analysed using a general linear model of the form lesion <dig> × experienced delaycov, with the factor × covariate interaction term included in the model. this confirmed that the lesion affected responding in acbc-lesioned rats, compared to controls, in a delay-dependent manner, over and above the postoperative differences in experienced delay .

locomotor activity and body mass
acbc-lesioned animals were hyperactive compared to sham-operated controls, and gained less mass then shams across the experiments , consistent with previous results  <cit> .

discussion
these results establish that the acbc contributes to learning of actions when the outcome is delayed. lesions of the acbc did not impair instrumental learning when the reinforcer was delivered immediately, but substantially impaired learning with delayed reinforcement, indicating that the acbc 'bridges' action-outcome delays during learning. lesions made after learning also impaired performance of the instrumental response in a delay-dependent fashion, indicating that the acbc also contributes to the performance of actions for delayed reinforcement. finally, the lesions did not impair the perception of relative reward magnitude as assessed by responding on identical concurrent interval schedules for reinforcers of different magnitude, suggesting that the impulsive choice previously exhibited by acbc-lesioned rats  <cit>  is attributable to deficits in dealing with delays to reinforcement.

effect of delays on instrumental learning in normal animals
delays have long been known to retard instrumental learning  <cit> . despite this, normal rats have been shown to acquire free-operant responding with programmed response-reinforcer delays of up to  <dig> s, or even  <dig> s if the subjects are pre-exposed to the learning environment  <cit> . delays do reduce the asymptotic level of responding  <cit> , though the reason for this phenomenon is not clear. it may be that when subjects learn a response with a substantial response-reinforcer delay, they never succeed in representing the instrumental action-outcome contingency fully. alternatively, they may value the delayed reinforcer slightly less; finally, the delay may also retard the acquisition of a procedural stimulus-response habit and this might account for the decrease in asymptotic responding. it is not presently known to what degree responses acquired with a response-reinforcer delay are governed by declarative processes  or procedural mechanisms , both of which are known to influence instrumental responding  <cit> ; it is similarly not known whether the balance of these two controlling mechanisms differs from that governing responses learned without such a delay.

effect of acbc lesions on instrumental learning and performance with or without delays
in the absence of response-reinforcer delays, acbc-lesioned rats acquired an instrumental response normally, responding even more than sham-operated controls. in contrast, blockade of n-methyl-d-aspartate  glutamate receptors in the acbc has been shown to retard instrumental learning for food under a variable-ratio- <dig>  schedule   <cit> , as has inhibition or over-stimulation of cyclic-adenosine-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase  within the acb  <cit> . concurrent blockade of nmda and da d <dig> receptors in the acbc synergistically prevents learning of a vr- <dig> schedule  <cit> . once the response has been learned, subsequent performance on this schedule is not impaired by nmda receptor blockade within the acbc  <cit> . furthermore, infusion of a pka inhibitor  <cit>  or a protein synthesis inhibitor  <cit>  into the acbc after instrumental training sessions impairs subsequent performance, implying that pka activity and protein synthesis in the acbc contribute to the consolidation of instrumental behaviour. thus, manipulation of acb neurotransmission can affect instrumental learning. however, it is also clear that excitotoxic destruction of the acbc or even the entire acb does not impair simple instrumental conditioning to any substantial degree. rats with acb or acbc lesions acquire lever-press responses on sequences of random ratio schedules  at near-normal levels  <cit> . in such ratio schedules, where several responses are required to obtain reinforcement, there is no delay between the final response and reinforcement, but there are delays between earlier responses and eventual reinforcement. it is therefore of interest that when differences between acbc-lesioned rats and shams have been observed, acbc-lesioned animals have been found to respond somewhat less than shams on such schedules late in training, when the ratio requirement is high  <cit> , consistent with our present results. however, lesioned rats are fully sensitive to changes in the instrumental contingency  <cit> . our present results indicate that when acbc-lesioned rats are exposed to a fr- <dig> schedule for food  in the absence of response-reinforcer delays, they acquire the response at normal rates.

in contrast, when a delay was imposed between responding and reinforcement, acbc-lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham-operated controls, in a systematic and delay-dependent fashion. the observation that learning was not affected at zero delay rules out a number of explanations of this effect. for example, it cannot be that acbc-lesioned rats are in some way less motivated for the food per se, since they responded normally  when the food was not delayed. thus although the acb and its dopaminergic innervation are clearly very important in motivating behaviour e.g.  <cit> , this is not on its own a sufficient explanation for the present results. an explanation in terms of a rate-dependent impairment is also not tenable, since the acbc-lesioned rats were capable  of responding at a level greater than they exhibited in the non-zero-delay conditions. depletion of acb da also impairs rats' ability to work on high-effort schedules, where many, or very forceful, responses are required to obtain a given amount of food  <cit> . however, in the present experiments the ratio requirement  and the force required per press were both held constant across delays, so this effect cannot explain the present results. similarly, although acbc lesions are known to impair the control over behaviour by pavlovian conditioned stimuli e.g.  <cit> , there was no pavlovian stimulus that was differentially associated with delayed as opposed to immediate reinforcement in this task, so this cannot explain the present results.

our results also indicated that when there were programmed delays to reinforcement, acbc-lesioned animals experienced longer response-reinforcer collection delays, partly due to their failure to collect the reinforcer as promptly as shams. these additional experienced delays probably retarded learning. however, in addition to this effect, there was a further deficit exhibited by acbc-lesioned rats: even allowing for the longer response-collection delays that they experienced, their instrumental learning was impaired more by delays than that of sham-operated controls. deficits in learning with delayed reinforcement may account for some of the variability in the effect of acbc lesions or local pharmacological manipulations on instrumental learning across different schedules.

the fact that pre-exposure to the context improves instrumental learning in normal rats  <cit>  suggests one possible mechanism by which acbc lesions might retard learning when delays are present. when a reinforcer arrives, it may be associated either with a preceding response, or with the context. therefore, in normal animals, pre-exposure to the context may retard the formation of context-reinforcer associations by latent inhibition, or it might serve to retard the formation of associations between irrelevant behaviours and reinforcement. similarly, non-reinforced exposure to the context forces the subjects to experience a zero-response, zero-reinforcer situation, i.e. p =  <dig>  when they are then exposed to the instrumental contingency, such that p >  <dig>  this prior experience may enhance their ability to detect the instrumental contingency Δp = p - p. in one aversive pavlovian conditioning procedure in which a conditioned stimulus  was paired with electric shock, acbc lesions have been shown to impair conditioning to discrete css, but simultaneously to enhance conditioning to contextual  css  <cit> , though not all behavioural paradigms show this effect  <cit> . it is therefore possible that enhanced formation of context-reinforcer associations may explain the retardation of response-reinforcer learning in acbc-lesioned rats in the presence of delays.

the instrumental task used requires animals either to associate their response with the delayed food outcome , or to strengthen a stimulus-response association  when the reinforcer eventually arrives  <cit> . both mechanisms require the animal to maintain a representation of their past action so it can be reinforced  or associated with food when the food finally arrives. this mnemonic requirement is not obviated even if the animal learns to predict the arrival of food using discriminative stimuli, and uses these stimuli to reinforce its responding : in either case, since the action precedes reinforcement, some trace of past actions or stimuli must persist to be affected by the eventual delivery of food.

a delay-dependent impairment was also seen when acbc lesions were made after training. this indicates that the acbc does not only contribute to the learning of a response when there is an action-outcome delay: it also contributes to the performance of a previously-learned response. again, acbc-lesioned rats were only impaired when that previously-learned response was for delayed  reinforcement. of course, learning of an instrumental response depends upon the animal being able to perform that response; preventing an animal from pressing a lever  would clearly impair its ability to learn an instrumental response on that lever to obtain food. in the present set of experiments, it is clear that acbc-lesioned rats were just as able to perform the response itself  as controls, as shown by their normal performance in the zero-delay condition, so it is not clear whether the delay-dependent impairments in learning and performance can be attributed to the same process. again, since responding was unaffected in the zero-delay condition, many alternative interpretations  are ruled out. it may be that acbc-lesioned rats are impaired at representing a declarative instrumental action-outcome contingency when the outcome is delayed, or in forming or executing a procedural stimulus-response habit when the reinforcing event does not follow the response immediately. it may also be that they represent the action-outcome contingency normally but value the food less because it is delayed, and that this affects responding in a free-operant situation even though there is no alternative reinforcer available.

discrimination of reinforcer magnitude in acbc-lesioned rats
excitotoxic lesions of the whole acb do not prevent rats from detecting changes in reward value   <cit> . such lesions also do not impair rats' ability to respond faster when environmental cues predict the availability of larger rewards  <cit> , and nor does inactivation of the acb with local anaesthetic or blockade of ampa glutamate receptors in the acb  <cit> ; the effects of intra-acb nmda receptor antagonists have varied  <cit> . acbc-lesioned rats can still discriminate large from small rewards  <cit> . similarly, da depletion of the acb does not affect the ability to discriminate large from small reinforcers  <cit> , and systemic da antagonists do not affect the perceived quantity of food as assessed in a psychophysical procedure  <cit> . our study extends these findings by demonstrating that excitotoxic acbc lesions do not impair rats' ability to allocate their responses across two schedules in proportion to the experienced reinforcement rate, even when the two schedules are identical except in the magnitude of the reinforcements they provide, thus demonstrating their sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude is quantitatively no worse than shams'. in this experiment, there was substantial undermatching, but this is common  <cit>  see also  <cit> ; differential cues signalling the two rewards might have improved matching but were not used in the present experiments since it is known that acbc lesions can themselves affect rats' sensitivity to cues signalling reinforcement  <cit> . given that acbc-lesioned subjects showed a reduced probability of switching between two identical ri schedules, it may be the case that an enhanced sensitivity to the cod accounts for the better matching exhibited by the acbc-lesioned rats  <cit> . alternatively, the lesion may have enhanced reinforcer magnitude discrimination or improved the process by which behaviour allocation is matched to environmental contingencies. in summary, the present results suggest that acbc damage leads to pathological impulsive choice   <cit>  not through any relative lack of value of large reinforcers, but through a specific deficit in responding for delayed reinforcement.

contribution of the acbc to reinforcement learning
the term 'reinforcement learning' simply means learning to act on the basis of reinforcement received; it is a term used in artificial intelligence research  <cit>  that does not specify the mechanism of such learning  <cit> . our present results indicate that the acbc is a reinforcement learning structure that is critical for instrumental conditioning when outcomes are delayed, consistent with electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging evidence indicating that the ventral striatum responds to recent past actions  <cit>  and to predicted future rewards  <cit> , and with computational models suggesting a role for the striatum in predicting future primary reinforcement  <cit> . however, when reward is certain and delivered immediately, the acbc is not necessary for the acquisition of instrumental responding. the delay-dependent role of the acbc indicates that it plays a role in allowing actions to be reinforced by bridging action-outcome delays through a representation of past acts or future rewards. acb lesions have also produced delay-dependent impairments in a delayed-matching-to-position task  <cit> ; their effects on the delayed-matching-to-sample paradigm have also been studied, but a more profound and delay-independent deficit was observed, likely due to differences in the specific task used  <cit> . finally, the acbc is not alone in containing neurons that respond to past actions and future rewards. the dorsal striatum is another such structure  <cit> ; expression of stimulus-response habits requires the dorsal striatum  <cit> , and the rate at which rats learn an arbitrary response that delivers electrical stimulation to the substantia nigra is correlated with the degree of potentiation of synapses made by cortical afferents onto striatal neurons, a potentiation that requires da receptors  <cit> . the prelimbic area of rat prefrontal cortex is important for the detection of instrumental contingencies and contributes to goal-directed, rather than habitual, action  <cit> . similarly, the orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala encode reinforcement information and project to the acbc, and lesions of these structures can produce impulsive choice see  <cit> . it is not yet known whether lesions of these structures also impair learning with delayed reinforcement.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that excitotoxic lesions of the acbc do not prevent rats from learning a simple instrumental response when the reinforcing outcome follows their action immediately. however, acbc lesions impair rats' ability to learn the same instrumental response when the outcome is delayed. the lesions also impair performance of an instrumental response that was learned preoperatively, but again only when response-reinforcer delays were present. these results suggest that the acbc makes a specific contribution to reinforcement learning and instrumental performance when reinforcing outcomes do not arrive immediately but are delayed. acbc dysfunction, which is known to promote impulsive choice, appears to cause rats to be temporally short-sighted, learning preferentially about the proximal consequences of their actions and preferring immediate over delayed rewards.
