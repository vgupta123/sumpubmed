BACKGROUND
there is considerable variation in arachis hypogaea l. subspecies hypogaea and fastigiata waldron, which are further classified into four market types including runner, virginia, spanish, and valencia  <cit> . most cultivated peanuts belong to spanish and runner types. they exhibit genetically-determined variation for a number of botanical and agronomical traits including branching and flowering habits, seed dormancy, and maturation time. however, there are few categorical criteria for distinguishing subspecies because of the limited detectable molecular polymorphism. recently, several molecular approaches have been employed to assess genetic diversity and taxonomic relationships. among them are isozymes  <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphisms , random amplified polymorphisms , amplified fragment length polymorphisms , and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . however, very little genetic polymorphism between the two subspecies was detected. singh et al.  <cit>  and bianchi-hall et al.  <cit>  found very limited or no variation among cultivated peanut based on seed protein profiles.

to date, proteomic analysis has proven to be the most powerful method for describing plant species and lines  <cit> , and identification for proteins  in complex mixtures. the strength of this method resides in high resolving power of two-dimensional page , coupled with polypeptide sequencing by highly sensitive mass spectrometry  such as electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry , and sequence homology search in databases  <cit> .

the aim of the research described in this paper was to investigate the ability of proteomic analysis to assess diversity of seed storage proteins in peanut for subspecies or cultivar identification. subspecies or cultivar-specific proteins, if they exist, should be helpful for genetic studies, breeding, taxonomy and evolutionary relationships in peanut.

RESULTS
analysis of gel electrophoresis
total protein extracts from six runner and six spanish-bunch peanut cultivars and lines were separated by one-dimensional sds-page, and the protein profiles revealed few major difference among all tested peanut genotypes . proteins were resolved as four groups . all but one peanut genotype had three strong bands in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> kda, which corresponds to acidic arachins. runner peanut a <dig> did not have this  <dig> kda polypeptide, a subunit of ara h <dig> present in other genotypes. this 35-kda protein peptide was reported as a 36-kda protein associated with blanchability in peanut  <cit> . a polymorphic protein band with a molecular weight of about  <dig> kda were present in all six runner type genotypes and three spanish derivatives gt-yy <dig>  gt-yy <dig>  and gt-yy <dig>  which all have a runner type peanut, induhuanpi, in their pedigrees .

we used two-dimensional electrophoresis  to achieve a better protein profile of each genotype . total protein from  <dig> peanut cultivars or breeding lines was subjected to 2-d page, resulting in about  <dig> spots found in all cultivars. these protein peptide spots covered a range of isoelectric points   and molecular masses . many components that were recorded on sds-page gel as a single band  were resolved into several distinct spots with different pi values by 2-d page gels . the conarachin group  with about  <dig> kda molecular weight by sds-page was separated into many spots with different pis. interestingly, the acidic arachin group with three clear bands ranging from  <dig> –  <dig> kda for all genotypes but a <dig>  was resolved into two bands by sds-page. there was additional polymorphism on 2-d page showing an additional spot in spanish type peanut as indicated by a arrow head , which confirmed the report by bianchi-hall et al.  <cit> . the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda protein bands, revealed on sds-page, were confirmed on 2-d page. the basic arachin group with one heavy band on sds-page at about  <dig> kda was separated into several spots or subunits on the 2-d page with distinct isoelectric points and slight differences in molecular weights . these patterns revealed polymorphisms between runner type and spanish type genotypes. there were four distinct protein spots labelled as spots 1– <dig>  spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were observed in all spanish-bunch genotypes, but were not found in those of runner types. in contrast, spot  <dig>  and spot  <dig>  were present in all runner genotypes but spot  <dig> was not in spanish-bunch type genotypes; spot  <dig> was present in these accessions with lower concentration. the polymorphic patterns revealed on 2-d page could be used to differentiate subspecies fastigiata   and subspecies hypogaea  .

polypeptide sequence analysis
protein peptide sequence analysis was conducted. the four polymorphic protein spots 1– <dig> were excised from the 2-d gels and pvdf membranes for peptide sequencing. for internal sequencing, two to three peptides were randomly picked and sequenced from each spot after in-gel trypsin digestion. the internal and n-terminal peptide sequences obtained for each spot and their homology identified through database searches are summarized in table  <dig> and fig.  <dig>  all peptide fragments had significant sequence homology to known peanut allergens, ara h <dig>  ara h <dig>  and iso-ara h <dig>  <cit>  . interestingly, all amino acid sequences of these  <dig> spots in fig.  <dig> and fig.  <dig> are present in different regions of peanut allergen proteins as aligned with the published peanut allergen sequences .

peptide sequence of spot  <dig> was unique, and present only in spanish-type peanuts. two peptides sequenced after in-gel trypsin digestion were the same, while one fragment gave 100%  identity and another fragment gave 88%  identity with iso-ara h <dig>  the n-terminal sequence  of spot  <dig> was 100% identical with iso-ara h <dig>  whereas ara h <dig> and ara h <dig> have two amino acids missing in this region . n-terminal sequencing for spot  <dig> and spot  <dig> resulted in the sequences containing vtfrqgg, identical with the sequence for iso-ara h <dig>  <cit> . the n-terminal sequence of spot  <dig> was gieeticsasvk, 100% identical with iso-ara h <dig> and one amino acid  different from ara h <dig> and ara h <dig>  supporting that spot  <dig> is the c-terminal part of this protein which always starts with gieetic  <cit> .

discussion
the initial intention of this study was to profile the storage proteins using improved protein extraction method and to identify protein markers that could be used to separate subspecies of peanut, such as hypogaea and fastigiata, in order to select diverse breeding lines for mapping population construction. based on the preliminary protein profiles  <cit> , we selected tifrunner and gt-yy <dig> for development of recombinant inbred lines  for genetic mapping. on 2-d page gels, several proteins, labelled as spots 1– <dig> with similar molecular mass and different pis, were sequenced. the peptide sequences obtained from these spots were all aligned to peanut allergens, such as iso-ara h <dig> , indicating that this single gene encoded protein may be processed differently in different peanut subspecies. the partial cdna sequence  was deposited in genbank by kang and gallo-meagher  <cit>  in  <dig>  a full-length cdna sequence identified in our est sequencing project has been submitted to genbank . the internal and n-terminal sequences of peptide spot  <dig> suggest that the apparent rearrangement of the amino acid sequence has occurred .

in peanut the majority of seed storage protein  is globulin consisting of two major fractions, arachin and conarachin  <cit> . the arachin subunits consist of the acidic polypeptides and the basic polypeptides  <cit> . the uniformity of the one-dimensional sds-page protein profiles within the runner type and spanish type cultivars and breeding lines is in agreement with the studies  <cit> , indicating that very low variation in protein profiles was detected in cultivated peanut using sds-page gel electrophoresis.

generally, sds-page is not a sufficiently-powerful technique to distinguish a specific cultivar. therefore, we adopted the widely used protocol developed by damerval et al.  <cit>  and introduced some modifications including a preliminary de-fatting step of peanut seeds for 2-d page separation. we were able to generate 2-d electrophoresis gel separations with superior resolution and recovery from peanut seeds. bianchi-hall et al.  <cit>  reported that the polypeptides of acidic arachin using sds-page distinguish spanish from other market type cultivars. in this study, we did not identify the four bands in the range of acidic arachin by sds-page , but we could detect the fourth spot of protein on 2-d page for spanish type genotypes . we also detected a  <dig> kda polypeptide by sds-page; this polypeptide could be used to differentiate spanish and runner.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that two-dimensional electrophoresis  achieved a better resolution of protein profiles of peanut seeds, revealing polymorphisms between runner and spanish genotypes. the basic arachin group, having one heavy band on sds-page gels at about  <dig> kda, was resolved into several spots or subunits on the 2-d page with distinct isoelectric points and slight differences in molecular weights. these proteins are isoforms  of each other and the iso-allergens may be modified by post-translational cleavage. these results suggest that there may be an association between these polymorphic storage protein isoforms and peanut subspecies fastigiata  and hypogaea . future studies could be designed to test the allergenic reactions of these peanut genotypes with different protein profiles and association with the resistance to aflatoxin contamination  <cit> .
