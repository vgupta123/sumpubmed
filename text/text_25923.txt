BACKGROUND
kalmegh , an annual herbaceous plant of the acanthaceae family, is cultivated in southern and southeastern asia for its diverse medicinal utilities  <cit> . during global flu epidemic in  <dig>  medicinal properties of kalmegh were effectively exploited to arrest spread of the contagious illness  <cit> . the genus andrographis comprises of about  <dig> species, among these kalmegh is most popular as medicinal plant  <cit> . although kalmegh has been widely used in traditional medicine in several asian countries, southern parts of india and sri lanka are considered as the centre of origin and diversity of the andrographis species. in india, kalmegh is a predominant constituent in several ayurveda, unani, siddha and tribal medicine formulations for the treatment of infectious diseases and health disorders  <cit> . in vitro and in vivo bioactivity studies, using plant extracts as well as isolated compounds, revealed the utilities of kalmegh as hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, anti-microbial, immunostimulatory, antioxidant and other health-promoting activities . kalmcold®, a clinically tested phytochemical composition of kalmegh, has been proven to be effective for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection  <cit> .

several bioactive specialized metabolites such as ent-labdane-related diterpenes , phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and xanthones were isolated from kalmegh  <cit> . however, ent-lrds that accumulate in leaves such as andrographolide , neoandrographolide  and 14-deoxy- <dig> -didehydroandrographolide  are considered as main bioactive constituents of kalmegh  . among these ent-lrds, andrographolide, the bitter principle of kalmegh, is most abundant and has been extensively studied for pharmacological activities such as immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities . andrographolide has been shown to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells by mitotic arrest and by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway  <cit> . andrographolide has also been shown to protect against cigarette smoke-induced oxidative lung injury via augmentation of the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes  <cit> . the anti-inflammatory activity of andrographolide was attributed to inhibition of the nuclear factor -kb pathway  <cit> . moreover, andrographolide was suggested to be effective in reducing chronic stress-triggered pathologies by regulating corticosterone and cytokine homeostasis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the medicinal plant kalmegh and major ent-lrds that accumulate in leaves. ad, andrographolide; nad, neoandrographolide; ddad, 14-deoxy- <dig> -didehydroandrographolide



the low yield of bioactive principles in kalmegh has led to increased market rate. although, good-quality dried leaves of kalmegh could be sold for us$5/kg, purified compounds and their derivatives may cost as much as us$ <dig> /kg from specialist chemical suppliers  <cit> . understanding the molecular basis of specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways and their regulation shall be effective in increasing yield as well as designing specific chemotypes following biotechnological and molecular breeding approaches  <cit> . however, the genes/enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of medicinally active specialized metabolites of kalmegh are yet to be identified and functionally characterized. the lack of transcriptomic and genomic resources is a hindrance for understanding the specialized metabolite biosynthetic pathways of kalmegh. only  <dig> expressed sequence tags  and  <dig> nucleotide sequences of kalmegh are available in the national center for biotechnology information  genbank database. in recent times, high throughput transcriptome sequencing using illumina short-read sequencing platform has become a powerful approach to develop reference transcriptome for gene identification in non-model plants .

in the present study, to generate a reference transcriptome of kalmegh for the identification of genes of the specialized metabolic pathways, transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly have been performed using tissues that either accumulate high level of ent-lrds  or do not accumulate ent-lrds . comparative analysis of leaf and root transcriptomes revealed candidate genes for the biosynthesis of ent-lrds. three class ii diterpene synthases  are identified. these class ii ditpss showed discrete spatio-temporal expression patterns; suggesting their participation into distinct diterpene metabolic pathways of kalmegh.

methods
plant materials and growth conditions
kalmegh  seeds were collected from the national gene bank for medicinal and aromatic plants . seeds were germinated in pre-sterilized soil and, at the second true leaf stage, seedlings were transplanted into earthen pots  with a mixture  of soil and vermicompost. plants were grown in a glass house during the months of july-october at 26–28 °c under the natural light. plants were watered daily with application of hoagland’s solution once a week. roots, stems and matured green leaves were obtained from two-month-old plants. samples were also collected at germinating seeds  and seedlings at cotyledonary leaf stage . all samples were washed with ro water, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °c.

rna isolation and cdna library preparation
total rna was isolated using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol . cdna library preparation was performed according to the illumina truseq rna library protocol outlined in “truseq rna sample preparation guide” . in brief, mrnas were isolated from  <dig>  μg total rna following poly-a rna purification method. further, purified mrnas were fragmented with divalent cations at 94 °c for 4 min and reverse-transcribed with superscript iii reverse transcriptase by using random hexamers. second strand cdnas were produced in the presence of dna polymerase i and rnaseh, and cdnas were cleaned up using agencourt ampure xp spri beads . following end repair and addition of a base, illumina adapters were ligated to the cdnas and spri cleanup was performed. amplification of the cdna library was carried out following eight cycles of pcr for the enrichment of adapter-ligated fragments. the cdna library was quantified using nanodrop and validated for quality by running an aliquot on high sensitivity bioanalyzer chip . the libraries showed peak spread over a range of 250–700 bp with the effective sequencing insert size of 130–580 bp, excluding adaptor sequences.

transcriptome sequencing, raw data processing and de novo assembly
paired-end  sequencing of root and leaf cdna libraries was carried out using illumina hiseq <dig> platform. sequence reads of the leaf and root libraries are deposited in the ncbis short read archive database under the accession number srp <dig>  raw reads were quality checked using seqqc v <dig>  tool  to remove adapters and low quality bases. de novo assembly of processed reads was performed using velvet- <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  for various hash length . k-mer of  <dig> was found to be better than others considering various parameters like total number of contigs generated, maximum contig length, total contig length and less number of n’s. further, oases  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was performed using velvet- <dig> . <dig> assembly, for the generation of final transcripts for root and leaf tissues. these transcripts were clustered using cd-hit  <cit>  at 95 % sequence identity to generate a non-redundant reference transcriptome for kalmegh. the strategy for the transcriptome assembly is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

transcriptome annotation and differential gene expression analysis
transcripts were similarity searched  against the sequences of acanthaceae family deposited at the uniprot-viridiplantae database. in addition, annotation was also carried out with rice and arabidopsis proteins available at the uniprot database. gene ontology was predicted for the annotated transcripts using go information from the uniprot database. metabolic pathway analysis was carried out using kaas server  <cit>  following default parameters and using arabidopsis and rice as the model organisms. transcripts encoding predicted glycosyltransferase enzymes were identified following annotation against eukaryotic glycosyltransferase sequences collected from the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database  <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> monoxygenase families were identified based on the sequence similarity to the cytochrome p <dig> monoxygenase sequences available at the uniprot database. for the identification of transcription factor families, transcripts were annotated to the plant transcription factor database . for the digital gene expression analysis , processed reads were aligned to the assembled transcriptome after generating unigenes to obtain read counts using custom perl scripts . reads were first aligned using “bowtie tool”  <cit>  and “awk scripting” was used to generate the read count profile from the output file  of bowtie alignment. differential gene expression analysis was carried out using deseq software  <cit>  considering root sample as control, as explained with a flow diagram in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

simple sequence repeats  prediction
ssr prediction was carried out using misa perl script . transcripts were checked for mono-repeats occurring at least ten times, di-repeats occurring at least six times and tri/tetra/penta/hexa-repeats occurring at least five times within a sequence. ssr was classified as complex when two ssrs were identified within 100 bp distance of each other.

quantitative real time pcr
rnas were isolated, treated with dnase i and purified using rneasy mini kit  as described previously  <cit> . three independent isolations consisting of at least three plants for each group were performed. rna quality was monitored by analysing the a260/ <dig> ratio and resolving on  <dig>  %  agarose gel. four microgram of total rnas were reverse-transcribed using superscript ii  and processed for qrt-pcr analysis using  <dig> ht fast real time pcr  as described previously  <cit> . oligonucleotide primers used in qrt-pcr amplification are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  relative gene expression was determined based on the 2-ΔΔct method using actin  as endogenous control.

high performance liquid chromatography
fresh tissues from germinating seeds , seedlings at cotyledonary leaf stage , roots, stems and leaves were harvested and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. using liquid nitrogen, and with the help of a pestle and mortar, frozen tissue was ground into fine powder. ground tissue  was extracted twice with 5 ml of methanol, evaporated to dryness and finally dissolved into 2 ml of methanol. hplc analysis was carried out using a hplc-uv  system as described previously  <cit> . stock solution  of authentic standard andrographolide  was prepared in methanol and used for standard curve preparation.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing, de novo assembly and quality assessment
for organisms that lack reference genome, high throughput transcriptome sequencing using illumina short-read sequencing platform combined with de novo transcriptome assembly has become a standard method in generating reference transcriptome with in-depth coverage . therefore, to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of medicinally active ent-lrds, a reference transcriptome of kalmegh was generated following high-throughput sequencing of transcriptome using illumina hiseq <dig> platform. as described in materials and methods, complementary dna  libraries were prepared from leaf and root tissues that accumulate contrasting levels of ent-lrds  <cit>  . paired-end  sequencing yielded  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million of raw reads for leaf and root, respectively. after processing of raw reads,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million of high quality reads representing  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb of high quality bases were obtained for leaf and root, respectively. these high quality reads were utilized for de novo transcriptome assembly following velvet_ <dig> . <dig> and oases_ <dig> . <dig> software packages  <cit> . the overall strategy of transcriptome assembly and analysis is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  by combining velvet- <dig> . <dig> and oases_ <dig> . <dig> analyses, a total of  <dig>  contigs with n <dig> of 926 bp and average length of 667 bp were generated for leaf transcriptome . however, in case of root, a total of  <dig>  contigs with n <dig> of 992 bp and average length of  <dig>  bp were generated. the minimum length of leaf and root contigs was 200 bp. a large number of contigs  were in the size range of 200–500 bp . on the other hand, ~25 % and ~15 % of contigs were in the size range of 501–1000 bp and 1001–3000 bp, respectively. these sequence data were in accordance to the transcriptomes reported for other plant species using illumina short-read sequencing platform .table  <dig> statistics for illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly

in order to evaluate quality of the assembled transcripts, identity and coverage of the sequences with the uniprot protein database were determined following blastx analysis . the translation products of  <dig>  % of the leaf and  <dig>  % of the root annotated transcripts showed ≥50 % sequence identity with protein sequences deposited to the uniprot database. moreover, ≥70 % sequence coverage was recorded for  <dig>  %  of the leaf and  <dig>  %  of the root annotated transcripts, representing nearly full-length transcripts. besides, ≥50 % sequence coverage was noticed for  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  of the leaf and root annotated transcripts, respectively. the average lengths of the transcripts with ˂50 % coverage were  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp for leaf and root, respectively. these parameters reflected the quality of the assembled transcripts.

annotation of the leaf and root transcriptomes
to assign putative function, transcripts were searched  for homology to the annotated sequences in the uniprot database, rice, arabidopsis and acanthaceae family  and also processed for the gene ontology  classifications  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis . functional annotation was assigned for ~60 % of the transcripts based on similarity to the annotated sequences in the uniprot database. however, ~30 % of the transcripts were annotated to the rice and arabidopsis sequences. because of limited transcript information on acanthaceae family species, only ~4 % of the transcripts showed similarity with the annotated sequences of the acanthaceae family species. blastx search to the uniprot database also provided information on to the species distribution of the annotated transcripts. when transcripts with ≥75 % of sequence identity to the annotated sequences in the uniprot database were classified based on top-hit species distribution, genlisea aurea represented top-hit species with similarity to  <dig> leaf and  <dig> root transcripts . this was in accordance with the fact that both g. aurea and a. paniculata belong to the order lamiales. only few transcripts showed similarity to the acanthaceae family species such as a. paniculata and avicennia marina. this reflected the lack of transcripts sequences of the acanthaceae family species in the database.

kegg pathways were annotated to  <dig> leaf and  <dig> root transcripts . in addition to several general  metabolic pathways, transcriptome also represented various specialized  metabolic pathways such as terpenoids and phenylpropanoids . specialized metabolites of these classes were previously isolated from kalmegh, however, their biosynthetic pathway genes were not identified  <cit> . functional analysis of the candidate genes of the specialized metabolic pathways shall be useful to understand the molecular and biochemical basis for the accumulation of medicinally active specialized metabolites in kalmegh.fig.  <dig> annotation of transcripts to different specialized metabolic pathways based on the kegg database



combined assembly of leaf and root transcriptomes and identification of the differentially expressed transcripts
to generate a non-redundant reference transcriptome of kalmegh, leaf and root assembled transcripts were clustered using cd-hit at 95 % sequence identity  <cit> . by following this approach, a total of  <dig>  transcripts with an average length of  <dig>  bp were generated . for the identification of differential transcripts, these assembled unique transcripts  were considered as master control transcript and the read count profiles were first determined for the leaf and root illumina reads using bowtie tool  <cit>  and further proceed for the differential gene expression analysis using degseq tool  <cit>  . this digital gene expression  analysis revealed  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts with expression only in leaf and root tissues, respectively. however,  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in leaf as compared to root. to authenticate dge-based expression profiles of the transcripts, a correlation with quantitative rt-pcr -based expression patterns was determined. for this,  <dig> transcripts that are related to the specialized metabolism were selected . the overall correlation coefficient  of  <dig>   indicated a very high level of correlation between dge- and qrt-pcr-based expression profiles of the transcripts. therefore, dge-based expression profiles may be considered to identify transcripts involved in tissue-specific accumulation of specialized metabolites in kalmegh. to identify candidate transcripts of the ent-lrd biosynthetic pathway, transcripts were classified according to the dge-based expression patterns in leaf and root tissues. dge-based expression profiles of the transcripts with annotation to the diterpene biosynthetic pathway and to different cyp <dig>  gt and transcription factor families are presented in table 3; additional file 1: figure s <dig>  additional file 7: table s <dig>  additional file 8: table s <dig> and additional file 9: table s <dig> table  <dig> combined assembly of leaf and root transcriptomes

transcripts of the diterpene biosynthetic pathway
in plants, plastidial 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate  and cytosolic mevalonic acid  pathways provide two 5c isoprenoid building blocks, dimethylallyl diphosphate  and isopentenyl diphosphate , for the biosynthesis of diverse terpene metabolites  <cit> . ipp and dmapp derived from the mep pathway are converted to monoterpenes, diterpenes, and tetraterpenes, whereas those derived from the mev pathway are converted to sesquiterpenes and triterpenes. however, cross-talk between these two pathways in biosynthesis of some terpenes was also recognised . previously, a major role of the mep pathway and a minor role of the mev pathway for supplying the 5c isoprenoid precursors for the biosynthesis of andrographolide were reported  <cit> . transcripts predicted to encode all the enzymes of the mep and mev pathways are identified in kalmegh transcriptome ; further demonstrating the quality and in-depth coverage of the transcriptome database generated in this study. interestingly, four transcripts for dxs, three for dxr and two each for hds, hdr, aact, hmgs, hmgr, pmk, mvd and idi were revealed in kalmegh transcriptome. this observation suggests the likely existence of multiple isomers for these enzymes in kalmegh.fig.  <dig> proposed pathway for ent-lrd biosynthesis in kalmegh. putative transcripts of the pathway and corresponding enzymatic steps are shown. ad, andrographolide; nad, neoandrographolide; ddad, 14-deoxy- <dig> -didehydroandrographolide



the second stage of diterpene biosynthesis involves head-to-tail condensation of three ipp and one dmapp to a c <dig> compound geranylgeranyl diphosphate  . this prenyltransfer reaction is catalyzed by the plastidial geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase . in ent-lrd biosynthetic pathway, ggpp is further cyclized into ent-diterpenyl diphosphate e.g., ent-copalyl diphosphate  following protonation-initiated cyclization mechanism catalyzed by the class ii diterpene synthase . ent-diterpenyl diphosphate then acts as substrate for the class i ditps that catalyzes further cyclization and/or rearrangement reactions  <cit> . thus, based on structures of kalmegh ent-lrds, the involvement of class i and class ii ditpss, cyp450s and gts enzymes in the biosynthesis of ent-lrds was hypothesized . from kalmegh transcriptome database, three partial transcripts for the ggps and three full-length transcripts for class ii ditpss with homology to the ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase  are identified . besides, several transcripts for cyp450s and gts are also recognized . transcripts that encode mep pathway enzymes, ggps, class ii ditps, cyp <dig> and gt, and preferentially expressed in leaf tissue  are potential candidates for the biosynthesis of ent-lrds in kalmegh. although, two class i ditpss with sequence similarity with ent-kaurene synthase are identified , none of them preferentially expressed in leaf. thus, their involvement in the biosynthesis of ent-lrd medicinal compounds in kalmegh may be excluded.fig.  <dig> relative expression level of transcripts, putatively related to ent-lrd biosynthesis. expression profiles of the mep pathway transcripts, ggpss and class ii ditpss were determined through qrt - pcr in root and leaf tissues. data are presented as log2foldchange  obtained from three biological replicates. differential transcript expression in root and leaf tissues was statistically evaluated either at p< <dig>  or p< <dig> 



in contrast to ditpss, not many cyp450s and gts of specialized diterpene biosynthetic pathways are known. some of the characterized members include cyp450s of taxol, phytoalexins and diterpene resin acid, and gts of steviol glycoside biosynthetic pathways . the majority of cyp450s of the specialized terpene metabolism belong to the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> clans  <cit> . from kalmegh transcriptome database,  <dig> transcripts that belong to the clan  <dig>  and clan  <dig>  are identified . among these,  <dig> transcripts preferentially expressed in leaf compared to root. on the other hand, family  <dig> gts  are the key players in glycosylation of specialized metabolites  <cit> . among the total of  <dig> gt1s of kalmegh,  <dig> gt1s preferentially expressed in leaf compared to root . further studies on these leaf-expressed cyp450s of the clan  <dig> and clan  <dig>  and gt1s can lead to the identification of potential oxidase and gt of kalmegh ent-lrd biosynthetic pathway.

identification of simple sequence repeats in diterpene biosynthetic pathway transcripts
simple sequence repeats  are often considered most efficient and reliable molecular markers for detecting genetic variations in plants  <cit> . therefore, to identify functional ssrs of kalmegh, leaf and root transcripts were examined for the presence of microsatellite motifs using microsatellite  tool . a total of  <dig>  potential ssrs were identified in  <dig>  leaf transcripts . whereas,  <dig>  ssrs were detected in  <dig>  root transcripts. moreover,  <dig> leaf and  <dig> root transcripts were detected with more than one ssrs. di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant ssrs in leaf and root transcripts with  <dig> and  <dig> ssrs, respectively. the numbers of compound ssrs were  <dig> and  <dig> in leaf and root transcripts, respectively. the complete lists of ssrs detected in leaf and root transcripts are provided in additional file 11: table s <dig> and additional file 12: table s <dig>  interestingly, several ssrs were also identified in transcripts of the specialized metabolic pathways, including terpenes and phenylpropanoids . ssrs were detected for the transcripts of the mep pathway enzymes , ggps and class ii ditpss . these ssrs could be useful in genotyping cultivars and developing specific chemotypes of kalmegh following marker-assisted selection.

identification and analysis of diterpene synthases
annotation of the kalmegh transcriptome revealed three ditpss that showed close phylogenetic relationship with the dicotyledons monofunctional class ii ditpss of ent-cpp product specificity . these are apcps <dig> , apcps <dig>  and apcps <dig>  . similar to class ii ditpss, the highly conserved dxdd motif that is essential for the protonation-initiated cyclization of ggpp was identified in apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig>  following multiple sequence alignment . sequence analysis revealed that apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig> encode for 832-, 817- and 797- amino acids proteins with calculated molecular masses of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kd, respectively. at the amino acid sequence level, apcps <dig> shared  <dig>  and  <dig>  % identities with apcps <dig> and apcps <dig>  respectively . however, apcps <dig> shared  <dig>  % amino acid identity with apcps <dig>  like other plant ditpss, n-terminal transit peptides for the chloroplast localization were recognised in apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig>  following ipsort  and predotar v.  <dig> .  analysis.fig.  <dig> the phylogenetic relationship of kalmegh class ii ditpss with ditpss of angiosperms, gymnosperms and moss. the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method. the evolutionary distances were computed using the poisson correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. evolutionary analyses were conducted in mega <dig>  ent-cps, syn-cps, -cps denote ent-, syn- and /normal copalyl diphosphate synthase, respectively. cls means copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase



apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig> exhibited dissimilar expression patterns in leaf and root tissues . the transcripts levels of apcps <dig> were comparable in leaf and root tissues. however, apcps <dig> showed high level of transcript accumulation in leaf and low level of transcript accumulation in root. in contrast, apcps <dig> transcripts were detected at very high level in root and at very low level in leaf. this divergent expression pattern of apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig> indicated their role in different diterpene metabolic pathways of kalmegh, although, their involvement in same biosynthetic pathway with functional redundancy cannot be completely excluded. in order to determine potential functions of apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> and apcps <dig> in kalmegh, transcripts levels were analysed in different plant organs and during seedling development stages following qrt - pcr . moreover, to correlate transcript expression with metabolite accumulation pattern, the level of andrographolide, the most abundant ent-lrd of kalmegh, was determined in plant organs and during seedling developmental ages following hplc analysis . maximum transcript level for apcps <dig> was detected in stem , followed by seedlings at cotyledonary leaf stage  as compared to germinating seeds . apcps <dig> transcript was also detected during seed germination. because ent-cpp also serves as precursor for the biosynthesis of phytohormone gibberellin  that is known to promote seed germination, seedling development and stem elongation in plant species  <cit> , we suggest the role of apcps <dig> in general metabolism by providing ent-lrd precursor for ga biosynthesis. in contrast to apcps <dig>  apcps <dig> transcript expression was maximum in leaf , followed by stem  as compared to gs. however, very low level of apcps <dig> transcript was detected during seed germination and in seedlings at the cls stage, as compared to leaf and stem. based on the transcript expression and ent-lrd metabolite accumulation patterns in plant organs and during seedling developmental ages, the role of apcps <dig> in tissue-specific accumulation of medicinal ent-lrds was anticipated . although, bioactive ent-lrds accumulate at high level in leaf , they were undetected or detected at very low level in root  <cit>  . the high level expression of apcps <dig> in kalmegh root  suggests biosynthesis of lrd in root which is/are yet to be identified. the role of apcps <dig> in root diterpene phytoalexin biosynthesis cannot be excluded. we hypothesized this function of apcps <dig> because class ii ditpss are known to play role in root phytoalexin biosynthesis in plants . moreover, kalmegh transcripts putatively encoding momilactone-a synthase, a phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway enzyme  <cit> , also expressed at high level in roots .fig.  <dig> tissue-specific expression profiles of class ii ditpss and accumulation pattern of major ent-lrd andrographolide. a transcript levels were determined by qrt-pcr analysis. data are presented as the mean  of three biological replicates. b andrographolide levels in different tissues were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. data are presented as the mean  of three biological replicates. andrographolide was either undetected or detected at very low level in gs, cls and root samples. *p< <dig>  and **p< <dig>  compared with gs sample



in medicinal ent-lrds biosynthetic pathway of kalmegh, ent-diterpenyl diphosphate/ent-cpp produced from class ii ditps activity might acts as substrate of class i ditps for further hydrolysis of the phosphate group without additional cyclization and rearrangement steps. this class i ditps activity may be related to the class i ditps activity of the bifunctional class i/ii ditps of selaginella moellendorffii  <cit> . however, transcripts that show sequence similarity to the class i ditpss and preferentially express in leaf tissue which accumulates medicinal ent-lrds, could not be identified. although two transcripts for class i ditpss with sequence homology to the ent-kaurene synthase are recognised , both of them preferentially expressed in root compared to leaf and have a stretch of overlapping sequences; suggesting that the two contigs might in fact represent a single transcript. therefore, the role of an endogenous phosphatase for the conversion of ent-diterpenyl diphosphate/ent-cpp into ent-diterpenol/ent-copalol is also likely, as was shown for the biosynthesis of diterpenol in nicotiana  <cit> . additional structural diversities in ent-lrds including oxygen functionality and glycosylation might be brought about by the activities of the cyp450s and gts, respectively, that preferentially express in leaf tissue .

CONCLUSIONS
several bioactive specialized metabolites, including ent-lrds were isolated from kalmegh  <cit> ; however, their biosynthesis was not studied. the present study was undertaken with the aim to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites with special emphasis on ent-lrds that are considered as the major medicinally active components of kalmegh. independent sequencing of leaf and root transcriptomes using illumina hiseq <dig> platform and individual as well as combined assembly of the transcriptomes resulted in generation of a reference transcriptome of kalmegh with in-depth coverage. this experimental approach also helped us to gather information regarding expression patterns of the identified transcripts in ent-lrd accumulating and non-accumulating tissues. transcripts predicted to encode all the enzymes of the mep and mev pathways, ggpss, ditpss, cyp450s and gts are identified and classified, and based on transcript expression patterns, their role in the tissue-specific accumulation of medicinal ent-lrds is discussed. our results indicate the occurrence of three isoforms for the class ii ditps  in kalmegh. these genes showed discrete spatio-temporal expression patterns suggesting their participation into distinct diterpene metabolic pathways of kalmegh. data suggest the role of apcps <dig> in general metabolism ; while apcps <dig> is potentially involved in the biosynthesis of medicinal ent-lrds in leaf. in contrast, expression pattern of apcps <dig> suggests its involvement in the biosynthesis of root diterpenes, possibly phytoalexins. in addition, ssrs were identified in the transcripts of the specialized metabolic pathways, including ent-lrds. these ssrs might be useful in selecting and developing desired chemotypes of kalmegh following molecular breeding approaches. taken together, these results will help us to understand the molecular and regulatory basis of tissue-specific accumulation patterns of medicinally active specialized metabolites in kalmegh and to develop molecular breeding strategies to improve their yields.
