BACKGROUND
the laboratory rat is a widely used model organism for studying both basic mechanisms of physiology, and disease models of human diseases. inbred rat strains and genetically segregating crosses are important tools in functionally proving disease mechanisms and represents a controlled setting where molecular interactions between different genetic factors as well as environmental factors can be tested  <cit> .

there are many common characteristics between chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis   <cit> , and multiple sclerosis   <cit> : these diseases are both consequences of dys-regulated immune responses that has initially been triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. peripheral joints in ra and myelin sheets in the central nervous system in ms are the sites of persistent inflammation that leads to tissue destruction. the most highly associated genetic region for the majority of these diseases is the major histocompatibility complex  and especially hla ii genes  <cit> . despite recent progress in identifying loci that associate with complex diseases in human  <cit> , the identification of the causative genetic polymorphisms, , and the understanding of their pathophysiological roles, still represents a significant challenge. the complexity of chronic inflammatory diseases lies not only in intricate interactions between genes and environment, but also in elaborate genetic phenomena such as gene-gene interactions, synergistic effects and epigenetic mechanisms.

animal models provide a means to control environmental factors and manipulate the genetic contribution. although the disease causing polymorphisms are not likely to be identical with humans we expect the associated pathophysiologic pathways to be conserved. using animal models could be a way to reveal their genetic complexity. in addition, the environmental exposure can be controlled and experimental manipulations are possible to perform. one other benefit of using animal models for genetic research is the possibility to selectively modify the genome e.g. producing congenic, knock-out or transgenic strains and linkage mapping.

da rats are remarkably susceptible to a number of autoimmune diseases; experimental arthritis induced with collagen  <cit>  or hydrocarbons such as mineral oil  <cit>  or pristane oil  <cit> , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  <cit> , experimental allergic neuritis  <cit> , experimental allergic uveitis  <cit> , and experimental autoimmune thyroiditis  <cit> . also among other inbred rat strains, the da rat is the most prone to develop inflammation . this disease susceptibility is mediated by both mhc and non-mhc genes. it is the only strain susceptible to oil-induced arthritis and other arthritis inducers provoke very severe disease in da compared to other susceptible strains. it has been shown that da rats from different colonies differ in disease susceptibility as well as contain distinct regions of genetic differences  <cit> , therefore we decided to sequence  <dig> sub-strains of da; da/olahsd and da/hankini .figure  <dig>

genetic linkage studies using f <dig> animals from an inter-cross between da and different disease resistant strains have identified about  <dig> quantitative trait loci  associated with susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. these qtls together cover approximately  <dig> genomic regions in the da rat that have been confirmed in more than one f <dig> inter-cross . the first f <dig> cross that used da as the inflammation susceptible strain was a da/k x e <dig> cross in pristane induced arthritis , that identified qtls on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . three more arthritis mapping studies and two in eae utilizing da/k x e <dig> f <dig> inter-crosses could verify the first four qtls and identified new qtls on chromosome  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . dahlman et al. used a da/k x aci f <dig> cross in eae to identify qtls on chr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and x  <cit> . the qtls on chr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were later confirmed in da/k x pvg.1av <dig> advanced intercross line  . in  <dig> two arthritis qtls were identified in lew.1av1x pvg.1av <dig> on chr  <dig> and  <dig> that later were replicated in a da/k x pvg.1av <dig> f <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig> a lew.1av <dig> x pvg.1av <dig> f <dig> cross identified two new qtls on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  that were replicated in two da/k x pvg.1av <dig> ail populations . the pvg.1av <dig> is a congenic strain sharing the mhc region with da, but is still resistant or develops extremely mild disease in response to most inflammation inducers. the e <dig> strain is an independent inbred rat strain that is highly resistant to most inflammatory diseases but which tends to develop obesitas and has a coagulation defect  <cit> . aiming to identify genomic regions that differ between disease susceptible and resistant strains, da/o, da/k, e3/han and pvg/1av <dig> kini were selected for sequencing.figure  <dig>

since the main purpose of this sequencing effort has been to create a tool to be used in all genetic studies of the inflammatory rat we have also selected  <dig> quantitative trait loci  that are ~ 1 mb in size, to dissect and report all the variations in the interval. main emphasis is put on non-synonymous snvs , synonymous snvs , snvs in utrs, splice-site snvs and snvs found in regions of high conservation between different species . the new snvs that are identified will have to be analyzed in more detail and assessed experimentally. however, they represent an entry point for functional validation of candidate molecular genetic mechanisms underlying established qtls.

the identified qtls that segregate between da and e3/pvg signify regions of regulatory importance in the development of chronic inflammatory disease. identifying the underlying factors within these disease-regulating regions would give important clues also for the diseases in human. the complete genomic sequence of the da strain and the disease resistant strains e <dig> and pvg comprise invaluable resources in the study of the polygenic nature of complex diseases such as chronic inflammatory diseases.

RESULTS
sequencing and variation calling
the four genomes da/olahsd , da/hankini , e3/han  and pvg/1av <dig> kini  were sequenced in three separate runs using the solid™ technology. aiming to also identify structural variations we made three mate-pair libraries with different insert sizes; 1 kb, 2 kb, and 4 kb as well as one paired end library. the reads were then mapped to the bn  reference genome with bwa  <cit> . this resulted in median coverage of 18-22x  and enabled us to cover >99% of the bn reference sequence with at least one read for all four genomes .

snvs and short indels were identified using a strategy developed by guryev et al  <cit> . to call a variant we required a minimum coverage of three reads and at least 75% of the reads had to support the non-reference allele. this predicted about  <dig>  million snvs and  <dig>  million short indels for all four genomes combined.

by comparing our snvs with the genotypes from the star consortium  <cit>  we estimated the sensitivity to be about  <dig> - <dig> %. in addition, we sequenced  <dig> regions  with capillary sequencing. of the  <dig> snvs identified by capillary sequencing  <dig> snvs were also identified by the solid sequencing, whereas two of the undetected snvs were missed because less than 75% of the reads carried the non-reference allele.  <dig> of the tested snvs were in the coding sequence of a gene and all these variants was identified in the solid snvs. four of the undetected snvs are in the hyper-polymorphic mhc region on chromosome  <dig>  further, no false positives were identified in these sequences.

variation analysis for the four genomes
snvs
each genome has about  <dig> million snvs and  <dig> - <dig>  million indels compared to the bn reference. approximately 70% of all snvs are outside ref-seq annotated gene regions. about 1% of the snvs are located in coding regions, and 21% of the snvs in coding regions are non-synonymous .table  <dig> 
snvs and short indels  compared to the bn reference


cds = coding sequence.



pair-wise comparison identified that more than 98% of the high-quality  snvs in da/o are shared with the closely related da/k. analyzing the snp distribution of the strains showed that about 14% of all snvs identified are unique to da/o and da/k, compared to bn, e <dig> and pvg . further, 29% of the identified snvs are shared by all four genomes and differ only from the bn reference sequence. a more detailed distribution of the snvs can be found in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

stop codons
each strain has between 70– <dig> snvs that results in a predicted premature stop codon . this affects a total of  <dig> genes, where about 60% are uncharacterized genes or olfactory and vomeronasal receptors. further, in  <dig> of these genes the stop codon was predicted in an alternatively transcribed gene, and not affecting all annotated transcripts from the gene.  <dig> of the stop introducing snvs were found in all  <dig> strains, whereas  <dig> are only present in one strain, with  <dig> unique for da,  <dig> for pvg and  <dig> for e <dig>  furthermore, there is one stop gaining unique to the da/k strain in the grb <dig> gene.

structural variants
next, we searched for structural variants between the strains. we detected  <dig> duplications in the range of  <dig> - <dig> kbp, and  <dig> deletions between  <dig> - <dig> kbp between da/o and e <dig> . deletions were predicted to affect  <dig> genes in da/o and  <dig> genes in e <dig>  fewer genes  were affected by deletions in da/k compared to pvg and  <dig> genes in pvg compared to da. the large number of gene deletions in da compared to e <dig> is to a large extent due to deletions on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  most of which are also deleted in pvg.

correlating snvs in different genomic features with differential expression and alternative splicing
aiming to dissect the influence from snvs occurring in different coding or transcript regulatory sequences such as splice-sites or utrs, on differential expression and splicing, we compared the occurrence of snvs within a certain gene with the expression of that gene. intragenic snvs were compared to a set of differentially expressed or alternatively spliced genes from a study by gillett et al.  <cit> . in this study differential expression and alternative splicing was analyzed in rna from lymph node cells from da/k and pvg rats 7 days after induction of eae. they detected  <dig> genes with convincing evidence of differential splicing between da and pvg, of which three  have predicted splice site variants that are unique to pvg. further,  <dig> had coding snvs. naturally; it needs to be further investigated if these are the variants that lead to the altered splicing.

to assess the correlation between differential expression or splicing and snvs on a larger scale, we looked for snvs in coding or utr regions as well as in splice sites in all genes with differential expression or splicing between da/k and pvg in the gillett et al. study and compared this with how often such snvs occur in genes that were not differentially expressed or spliced. there was a significant enrichment of genes with snvs in utrs and coding sequences among the genes that displayed differential expression compared to genes that did not . due to the multiple probe design of the affymetrix arrays, the coding snvs should not influence the actual hybridization to the array and thus the difference should be reflecting the biology  <cit> . similarly, there was an enrichment of genes with snvs in splice sites, utrs and coding regions in alternatively spliced genes compared to the genes where no alternative splicing was detected . this suggests that coding snvs as well as snvs in utrs and in splice sites are more frequent in genes that display differential expression or alternative splicing. however, there are still many genes without the variants that are differentially regulated. hence, the absence of such variants cannot be used to exclude a gene as a candidate. in addition, there are additional types of genomic variations, such as larger structural variants like partial and whole gene duplications, which also need to be analyzed, since they can have a major impact on gene expression and splicing  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
the association of snvs in different gene regions and differential expression or splicing. association of snvs in different gene regions and differential expression or splicing, as reported in gillett et al.  <cit> . the fractions of genes that have snvs in i) coding region, ii) utr or iii) splice sites were measured. a, genes predicted to be differentially expressed between da/k and pvg compared to genes with no differential expression in this condition. three different levels of fold change were used to categorize differentially expressed genes, resulting in  <dig> genes with fold change  >  <dig>   <dig> genes with fc >  <dig> ,  <dig> genes with fc >  <dig>  and  <dig> genes with no differential expression. b, alternatively spliced genes compared with genes with no evidence of alternative splicing in this condition. three significance levels were used to categorize significant alternative splicing in genes, resulting in  <dig> genes in the highest significance category p <  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> genes that were not considered alternatively spliced.



pairwise comparison of disease susceptible and resistant genomes
comparing two da sub-strains
there are more than  <dig> million of the identified snvs between da and e <dig> and between da and pvg that could contribute to the phenotypic difference. however, even between the very similar da/o and da/k there is a difference in sensitivity to arthritis induction  <cit> . looking closer at the polymorphic regions between da/o and da/k we could show that the strains differ primarily in regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which is in complete agreement with the results by rintisch et al. however, we were able to better define the intervals, and two of the regions could be divided in two distinct regions each and we also found a new region on chromosome  <dig> that differs between these sub-strains . in total, these eight regions include approximately  <dig> mbp and contain  <dig> genes of which  <dig> have nssnvs or stop codon variants. congenic data showed no effect on disease sensitivity from the region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , hence the variants causing the different arthritis susceptibility are more likely to be located on the other chromosomes, harboring in total  <dig> genes .figure  <dig> 
da/o and da/k segregating snv regions. snvs between da/o and da/k plotted on the chromosomes. the dark bands are due to high snv density in  <dig> regions that distinguish da/o and da/k. only positions supported by at least  <dig> reads in both strains were included in the picture.


da/o and da/k differentiating regions


.

to infer if the regions of differences are contaminations from earlier crosses or hyper polymorphic regions, we compared the snvs in the regions with the star genotypes of a number of other strains  <cit> . snv comparisons show that da/k or da/o displays an alternating pattern of identical sequence to aci in each of the identified intervals . the patchy pattern of the diverging regions between the two da strains is most likely the effect of the strains being separated and inbred separately before the da strain was completely homozygous for all chromosomes.

the origin of the da strain is often reported to be unknown but it has been documented to be derived from a stock from a dr. t.t. odell, jr. at oak ridge national laboratory, tennessee. in  <dig> dr. odell describes an agglutination test with an experimental set up using animals from a cross between two inbred lines that fits very well with what we now know about the da strain  <cit> . the first strain for the initial intercross is an irish coated strain that had been backcrossed for  <dig> generations that express the d antigen on their erythrocytes. this strain was most likely aci . the second inbred strain in the inter-cross expressed the c antigen instead and had only been backcrossed for nine generations. some suggestions of the c antigen strain are early generations of the e <dig>  buf or lew strains, which carry this allele. the f <dig> progeny was then backcrossed to either the d or the c strain. the d/d backcross population is most likely the founder of the d-antigen expressing agouti coat color  strain. inbreeding was at inter-cross generation  <dig> in about  <dig>  however a subset of the da colony was sent from wistar to oxford already in  <dig>  where it was further inbred. thus, the two da sub-strains were separated at generation < <dig> before the chromosomes had become homozygous which explains the dissimilar regions. it is also possible that more da sub-strains exist in laboratories throughout the world.

functional comparison – genomic variance within inflammation associated qtls
dissecting the genomic influence on inflammation requests a lot of phenotypic data. both linkage studies and congenic mapping have identified ~ <dig> genomic regions in the da rat associated to inflammatory disease . the variation analyses of smaller qtls, approximately  <dig> mb in size, are described in more detail below and a schematic overview of all inflammation qtls identified in comparisons of the three genomes irrespective of interval size are described in table  <dig> table  <dig>

chromosome 1
chromosome  <dig> harbors two regions of qtls for both eae and pia,  <cit> , the fine-mapping of the two qtls down to a shorter genomic interval has been done in eae.

one qtl region eea29/pia <dig> is positioned close to the centromere and this region regulates both eae and pia. beyeen et al. fine-mapped this qtl in eae to less that  <dig> mb using an ail and they also validated the regulatory effect using a  <dig> mb congenic strain  <cit> . the refined eae29/pia <dig> contains  <dig> genes. beyeen et al. could show differential gene expression in the genes il22ra <dig> and ifngr <dig> and association to il22ra <dig> could be shown in a cohort of ms patients. therefore these two genes are strong candidates as regulators of inflammatory disease and thus it is important to study all variants in the region for regulatory effects and if they coincide with conserved regions. comparing snvs between the strains da and pvg in the shorter eae <dig> region displayed very little variation between da and pvg. surprisingly, only  <dig> snvs were identified between  <dig> - <dig>  mb. il22ra <dig> had one snv in the second intron and ifngr <dig> had one snv in the first intron. to analyze if the snv is in a conserved segment and thus may be coinciding with a regulatory element, the conservations score for the snvs was assessed. the snv is considered to be conserved if the score is higher than  <dig> , . three of the snvs in eae <dig> coincide with highly conserved regions . further comparison of these snvs to data from eight inbred rat strains  <cit>  identified two snvs in conserved regions to be unique for the da stain and the snv in il22ra <dig> is unique for da and one of its ancestral genomes aci .figure  <dig>

the second qtl on chromosome  <dig> has been fine mapped in both eae and pia from an interval between 176– <dig> mb and was resolved into two distinct qtls eae <dig> and eae <dig>  eae <dig> is positioned to a region of less than  <dig> mb around  <dig> mb and eae <dig> to  <dig> mb close to  <dig> mb  <cit> . eae <dig> was fine-mapped in both eae and pia to five candidate genes and the region showed evidence of association to human inflammatory disease to a snv in the il21r. no coding polymorphisms could be identified in the il21r gene in the rat, but the il4ra gene had a splice site snv. four snvs are unique to da . in addition, two other genes in the region, gtf3c and loc <dig>  displayed numerous nssnvs. further, looking at snvs in conserved regions identified  <dig> potentially regulating snvs . the il4ra gene also contains two ssnvs, whereas the il21r gene contains one potentially regulating snv in an intron .

in the nohra et al. study  <cit> , an additional  <dig>  mb eae specific qtl eae <dig> close to the rgma gene was identified in a g <dig> ail. interestingly, there was suggestive association to the human rgma gene also in an ms cohort. there are  <dig> polymorphisms between da and pvg in rgma. ten of the variants are of potential interests; three snvs in conserved regions and one synonymous snv in the last exon. four snvs in the region are unique for da/aci .

chromosome 4
rat chromosome  <dig> is one of the most qtl dense regions in the da genome. three regions have been linked to eae and arthritis. the qtl pia5/eae24- <dig> have also been linked to experimental diabetes  <cit>  and uveitis  <cit> . there is also evidence that the chromosome has regions of epistatic genetic interactions  <cit> .

the original pia5/eae24- <dig> locus is more than  <dig> mb and covers  <dig> to  <dig> genes depending on the study and disease model  <cit> . among the genes in this region are tcrbv, ig kappa genes and il23r, with potential profound importance in immune regulation. in  <dig> marta et al. used a combination of congenic lines as well as an advanced intercross line to dissect disease regulation in this region. they showed that the effect on disease regulation was larger than the effect from any of the smaller congenic strains, however one small  congenic strain  mediates a major part of the regulatory effect from this region. no coding variations could be identified between da and pvg in this region, which indicates that the disease regulating variation is regulatory. indeed, this region is very conserved between species and of the  <dig> snvs in the interval  <dig> coincided with conserved genomic intervals. not surprisingly, many of the genes in the region have important function in embryonic development.

next, the arthritis qtl oia2/pia <dig> at  <dig> - <dig>  mb is known to be a strong regulator of adjuvant-induced arthritis such as oia or pia  <cit> . further, this arthritis qtl coincides with the eae qtls eaae20- <dig> <cit> . the region harbors the aplec complex, which encodes a set of c-type lectin receptor genes expressed on antigen presenting cells. most of the aplec genes have been shown to be differentially expressed after stimulation with a number of immune-triggering stimulants  <cit> . there are a number of coding polymorphisms in the aplec complex encoded genes. one generates a premature stop-codon in clec4b <dig> in the da genome and is certainly a plausible candidate to mediate the disease phenotype. however, four other aplec encoded genes have non-synonymous snvs between da and e3/pvg. furthermore, a total of  <dig> snvs could be identified in the  <dig> kb consensus region and  <dig> polymorphisms lie within conserved regions in or close to genes. neither of the snvs in the aplec complex are unique to da but are shared between at least five other inbred genomes   <cit> . one region at  <dig>  kb has the maximum conservation score =  <dig>  according to the phastcons9way, and could be a regional enhancer for the aplec genes in the region. this region harbors two snvs. this region needs to be analyzed further to conclusively determine weather this is an enhancer or not.

chromosome 10
chromosome  <dig> harbors at least four susceptibility genes for experimental inflammatory disease. proximal to the centromere is the vra1/ciita gene locus  <cit> , which is part of a haplotype identified to regulate levels of mhc class ii expression, and which was also reported to be associated with chronic inflammatory disease  <cit> . the variant underlying the effect has however not been identified. ciita contains no nssnvs between da and pvg. however, there are three synonymous coding snvs that may influence the expression levels of which two are unique for e3/pvg . in addition, there are a number of polymorphisms in conserved regions with potentially regulatory effect on the gene. the  <dig> kb upstream promoter of ciita harbors two very conserved regions with  <dig> snvs of which one is unique to e3/pvg.

the mid-part of chromosome  <dig> has been associated with both eae and arthritis eae18/cia5/oia <dig> <cit> . eae <dig> qtl was fine-mapped using two ails, g <dig> and g <dig>  which divided the qtl in two qtls, eae18a and eae18b <cit> . eae18a was fine-mapped to  <dig>  mb harboring  <dig> genes at  <dig> - <dig>  mb  <cit> . two nssnvs in fam64a and ensrnog <dig>  as well as two snvs in splice-sites of rgd <dig> and smtln <dig> were identified in the eae18a locus, in addition to several potentially regulating snvs.

eae18b was fine-mapped to a  <dig>  mb region between  <dig> - <dig>  mb in a g <dig> ail  <cit> . two genes in this region ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> showed differential expression. interestingly, differential expression of ccl <dig> has also been observed between ms patients and controls. however in a functional characterization study of the eae18b congenic strain, ccl <dig> was conclusively identified to be regulating many different disease pathways in this strain  <cit> . ccl <dig> has six snvs in the 3′utr of which four are in conserved sequences; the gene also has one conserved intronic snv and one synonymous snv .

in experimental arthritis a qtl has been identified in both da/pvg and da/f <dig> crosses on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this arthritis specific qtl was fine-mapped in pristine-induced arthritis using an ail g <dig>  <cit> . also for this qtl the locus was separated in to two regions. interestingly the second  <dig>  mb region coincided with a region with cd <dig> like genes, which contain distinct regions of very high variation between da and the other strains . the aggregation of snvs in the vicinity of cd <dig> genes may be an indication of structural variations in the region and needs to be further studied, however these genes could have a significant influence on the regulation mediated by this region. interestingly this locus was not mapped in any of the daxe <dig> f <dig> crosses, which suggests that the regulating polymorphism could be unique to the pvg strain. in the other region pia <dig>   <dig> snvs were identified that segregated e3/da and pvg alleles, of which most are intronic or intergenic snvs in or near the rpl <dig> and ttyh <dig> genes.

chromosome 12
the first arthritis regulating qtl to be cloned and positioned to one polymorphism is the pia <dig>  which was identified to be regulating chronic inflammation by a non-synonymous snv in the ncf <dig> gene, altering the amino acid at position  <dig>  <cit> . it was originally mapped using both pia   <cit>  and eae models   <cit> . the gene was identified using a congenic strain with e <dig> alleles between  <dig> - <dig>  mb and harbors three genes. here, a total of  <dig> snvs were detected between da and pvg/e <dig> in the pia <dig> region. five of them are coding variants, of which one is non-synonymous and one is annotated to be in a splice site of gtf2i. moreover,  <dig> snvs are located in utrs of which  <dig> are in the 3′utr of the ncf <dig> gene, but they have low conservation scores. five snvs are in potentially conserved regions, but only one of them, the nssnv, is in ncf <dig>  hence, the genome sequences support the previous findings that the inflammation regulatory effect from this congenic is mediated by the ncf <dig> nssnv  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
da rats are particularly susceptible to the induction of a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. there is a modest difference in arthritis susceptibility between the two strains where da/o is slightly more susceptible. here we identified eight polymorphic regions between two substrains of da; da/k and da/o together covering 38 mb of genomic sequence. of the variable regions, 23 mb are located on chromosome  <dig> and by using a da/o.chr3da/k congenic strain these regions were excluded as important in arthritis regulation  <cit> , and thus the regulatory effect should come from the remaining 15 mb variable regions between da/o and da/k.

according to the rat genome database more that  <dig> inflammatory disease related qtls have been identified in the da rat. here we have used the next-generation sequencing of the da genome and inflammatory disease resistant e <dig> and pvg to investigate  <dig> fine-mapped qtls and closely catalogue the complete set of variations in these regions. this study has identified a number of interesting non-synonymous or regulatory variants within these qtls.

for the already positionally cloned gene, ncf <dig>  in the pia <dig> qtl on chromosome  <dig>  no additional regulatory snvs were identified in the proximal region of ncf <dig> that are likely to contribute to the regulation of inflammation in the region. hence, this further enhances the importance of the previously detected nssnv  in the regulation of experimental inflammatory disease.

two of the inflammatory-disease regulating regions analyzed here; the vra1/ciita and eae25/r <dig> loci are completely devoid of coding snvs, but do contain several snvs in conserved regions, indicating regions of regulatory function.

four of the qtls  have strong candidate genes that have been identified to be differentially expressed between da and pvg as well as associated to chronic inflammatory disease in human cohorts. these gene-regions were analyzed for regulatory polymorphisms. eae <dig> has three very good regulatory snv candidates that should be assessed for disease regulation in the vicinity of il22ra <dig>  the expression of il22ra <dig> has been demonstrated to differ between the strains implicating difference in regulatory regions  <cit> . il22ra <dig> is now one of the well-established ms risk genes  <cit> . eae <dig> has one non-synonymous snv in a topoisomerase like gene, however this gene may not be the disease-regulating gene in the interval. rgma, which is the top candidate gene in the region, contains  <dig> conserved regions with possible regulatory snvs. the top candidate gene for the eae <dig> locus is il21r. this gene has only one identified snv with potential regulatory function in the first intron of the gene. eae <dig> also contains a splice site snv in the il4ra gene plus two potential regulating snvs that also should be tested for eae regulation. the qtl eae18b harbors the ccl <dig> gene that have shown strong immune-regulatory effects in inflammatory disease  <cit> . ccl <dig> contains five highly conserved snvs and particularly four snvs in the 3′utr are strong candidates to be regulators of differential expression.

the aplec locus on chromosome  <dig> harbors five nssnvs in four genes. this region contains very few conserved regions, however a new impending regulatory region  <dig> kb upstream of the last gene  in the complex was identified that contains two snvs in the middle of the conserved region. this region has to be analyzed further to fully comprehend if and how it could regulate all genes in the region.

a hyper-variable region in pia <dig> on chromosome  <dig> was also identified. this region contains four snv dense regions of about 10 kb in size each. these variable regions occur in the extended 3′utr of cd <dig> genes, cd300b and cd300f in particular. this enrichment of snvs in a short interval may perhaps be explained by sequence duplications/divergence.

by combining information for the most interesting snvs in the herein analyzed qtls with snv information from an eight genome sequencing study of inbred rats  <cit> , we identified a number of snvs unique for inflammation susceptible da and the inflammatory disease resistant pvg and e <dig> strain. three qtls had da or da/aci unique snvs and one had e3/pvg unique snvs. out of the eight qtls that were used in this comparison only four had unique snvs. this is somewhat expected since one of the few cloned chronic inflammatory disease regulating snv, in the ncf <dig> gene, also is present in the inbred strains buf, f <dig> and wky. the strain buf is susceptible to both arthritis and eae whereas both f <dig> and wky are resistant to experimental arthritis. the disease regulation mediated by this snv is however very strong and has been confirmed to be disease regulating also in mice. this demonstrates that additional protective genes in the genome may mask even very strong disease enhancing snv effects.

in a genotype to phenotype perspective, the combined effect from the qtls has profound functional implications. in short, both the adaptive and innate immunity is affected; the ncf <dig> gene is involved in the first defense against infections and triggering the immune system. both the cd <dig> and the aplec encoded genes are important pattern recognition receptors involved in antigen uptake and ciita is important in regulating antigen presentation. the chemokine ccl <dig> and the cytokine receptors il21r and il22ra <dig> are important in modulating the immune responses leading to inflammation. il21r and il22ra <dig> are particularly important regulators of activated t cells. in conclusion the  <dig> qtls represent regions of important disease regulation and the combined effect explains a substantial part of the pro-inflammatory phenotype that is characteristic of the da strain.

the full genomic sequence of da/o, da/k, e <dig> and pvg constitutes an invaluable resource in the understanding of how polymorphisms in the da genome contribute to disease susceptibility and this genetic blueprint of an inflammation permissive rat strain will also be important in the understanding of the human etiologies for chronic inflammatory disease.
