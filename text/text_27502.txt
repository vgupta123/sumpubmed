BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar typhimurium is one of the most prevalent serovars isolated from ill humans in mexico, with swine being the most common food-animal reservoir  <cit> . the appearance of strains with multiple drug resistance, including resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins , as ceftriaxone , was reported to increase the morbidity and mortality in yucatán, one of the poorest states in the country  <cit> . in order to establish the genetic composition of the emerging strains we conducted a series of investigations to determine the genetic variability of core and accessory genome compartments of the mexican typhimurium population. a representative collection of more than a hundred strains, derived from an integrated surveillance program including asymptomatic and ill humans, and farm-animals  <cit> , was analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing and other molecular techniques  <cit> . in the first study, we found that the typhimurium population from mexico was composed of two main genotypes: st <dig> and st <dig>  each genotype was associated with different accessory genetic elements. the salmonella virulence plasmid  was found only in the st <dig> strains, whereas the st <dig> strains harbored inca/c plasmids , suggesting that these two genetic elements are incompatible  <cit> .

in a second study, we determined that the blacmy- <dig> gene conferring resistance to esc was carried by the inca/c plasmids harbored by st <dig> strains  <cit> . inca/c plasmids are recognized as having broad host ranges, but their conjugal transfer capacities are variable  <cit> . we found that most of the pa/c of st <dig> strains were not conjugative under our experimental conditions; among the twenty one strains studied, only strain yuhs05- <dig>  was able to transfer esc resistance to escherichia coli laboratory strain dh5α  <cit> .

the observation that in the mexican typhimurium population none of the st <dig> and st <dig> strains harbored both pstv and pa/c led us to hypothesize that a restriction to horizontal transfer and establishment of co-residence of these plasmids, an incompatibility, existed. to address this issue we designed a conjugation scheme using st <dig> strain yu <dig> as donor, with two e. coli lab strains  and two typhimurium st <dig> strains  as recipients. in the current study, we assessed whether the genetic background of the different recipient strains affected the transfer frequencies of pa/c, and looked for negative interactions between the transfer of pa/c and the presence of pstv in the recipient strains.

we found that yu <dig> was able to transfer cro resistance to all the recipient strains, although at low frequencies, ranging from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig>  unexpectedly, the analysis of the transconjugants showed that three different phenomena were occurring associated to the transfer of blacmy-2: 1) the co-integration of pa/c with a co-resident incx <dig> plasmid ; 2) the transposition of the cro resistance determinant blacmy- <dig> from pa/c to px1; or 3) the transfer of pa/c displaying genetic re-arrangements. in addition, the co-lateral mobilization of a small  cole1-like plasmid was observed. these experiments demonstrate the possibilities that a single strain can exploit to contend with the challenge of horizontal transfer and antibiotic selective pressure.

methods
typhimurium strains
to study the genetic interactions among pstv and pa/c, we selected two strains from our previously studied mexican typhimurium population  <cit> . the internal review boards and ethics committees of all collaborating hospitals in the surveillance network approved the protocol, and written informed consent was collected from the guardians of all participants to obtain fecal and/or blood samples, and use the clinical and microbiologic information for scientific studies  <cit> . the st <dig> strain yu <dig> was used as a pa/c donor, since this was the only strain capable of conjugal transfer  <cit> . this strain harbored five plasmids: the  <dig> kb pa/c and four plasmids of different sizes , for which no information was available. we selected strain sohs 02- <dig>  which contains a  <dig> kb pstv and a cryptic  <dig> kb plasmid  <cit> , and the reference strain lt <dig> which only carries the  <dig> kb pstv  <cit> , as representative strains of the st <dig> genotype harboring pstv. the pstv of so <dig> and lt <dig> were marked with a kanamycin resistance cassette inserted into the spvc gene  according to the datsenko and wanner protocol  <cit> . these strains were named so1pstv::km and lt2pstv::km, and were used as recipients in conjugation experiments .

transformation of pa/c and pstv into e. coli dh5α
compatibility tests between pa/c and pstv plasmids were performed in escherichia coli laboratory strain dh5α. to obtain a dh5α harboring the two plasmids, the so1pstv::km was transformed into dh5α and selected using kanamycin ; this strain was then used a recipient for transformation with the yu <dig> pa/c and selected with ceftriaxone . transformants were evaluated for resistance to cro and km. based on a previously developed pcr screening spvc and trat genes were used to track pstv, while repa/c and r- <dig> were tested for the presence of pa/c  <cit> . plasmid integrity was confirmed by plasmid profiling using a modified alkaline lysis procedure  <cit> , and visualized by electrophoresis in  <dig> % agarose gels subjected to  <dig> v for  <dig> hours.

plasmid stability tests
for the e. coli dh5α strain harboring both pa/c and pstv::km plasmids, stability experiments were performed . this strain was sub-cultured for approximately  <dig> generations  and colonies were analyzed to determine the fraction of cells in the population harboring pa/c and pstv::km plasmids. colonies from the lb plates were picked onto lb plates containing either cro or km. two randomly chosen colonies were selected in all time points for pa/c and pstv::km pcr screening with repa/c, r- <dig>  spvc and trat.

conjugation experiments
a set of conjugation experiments was designed using yu <dig> as donor and five recipient strains: two typhimurium st <dig> strains so1pstv::km and lt2pstv::km, the two laboratory e. coli strains dh5α and hb <dig>  along with a transformed hb <dig> strain carrying the so1pstv::km . in addition, the yu <dig> pa/c was transformed into e.coli dh5α and the resultant strain  was used as a donor in the same conjugation scheme. briefly, conjugations were performed on lb plates using a 1: <dig> donor to recipient mix and incubated at 37°c overnight. all the recipient strains were spontaneous resistant-mutants to rifampicin  and nalidixic acid . the overnight conjugation mix was resuspended in  <dig> ml of water, and dilutions were spread on lb plates containing cro, km and nal as selection antibiotics. transfer frequencies were calculated as the number of transconjugants per donor.

some of the resultant transconjugant colonies were selected for further analysis and named using the following code: for each recipient strain a capital letter was assigned ; the experiment number was coded by roman numerals from i to iv; and a colony number was assigned . for example, transconjugant iiic <dig> was the colony number  <dig> of the third conjugation experiment to recipient hb <dig> 

in order to assess the integrity of the transconjugant plasmids, they were transformed into dh5α, selected with cro, and analyzed by plasmid profiling, restriction analysis and pcr screening . these transformant strains were then used as donors in a second round of conjugation, using dh5α or the original recipient strains  as recipients resistant to rifampicin and nalidixic acid. the first rounds of conjugations were performed four times, while second rounds of conjugations were performed twice.

cloning strategy to discover px <dig> and pcole1-like
to determine the genetic identity of the non-pa/c plasmid that acquired the blacmy- <dig> gene, the transconjugant plasmid of strain ic <dig> was restricted with  <dig> u of sau3a, and cloned into puc <dig> digested with bamhi using standard methods  <cit> . the cloned region containing the blacmy- <dig> gene was sequenced using the puc <dig> lacz primers , and blast searches were performed to detect homology with sequences in public databases . the cmy region surroundings showed homology to incx <dig> plasmids , and pou <dig> was selected as the reference px <dig> plasmid . to generate a px <dig> genetic marker we designed primers to amplify the px <dig> replication region .

to establish the genetic identity of the  <dig> kb plasmid, the band was purified from the yu <dig> plasmid profile using zymoclean™ gel dna recovery kit . libraries were constructed by digestion with sau3a, and cloned into puc <dig> digested with bamhi using standard methods  <cit> . the cloned fragments were sequenced using the puc <dig> lacz primers , and blast searches were performed to detect homology with sequences in public databases . the analysis of clones showed homology to mob regions of cole <dig> plasmid family, and plasmid sn11/00kan  from newport strain sn <dig>  <cit>  was used as reference to design a pcr marker for this plasmid .

transconjugant plasmid profiles, initial pcr screening and restrictions
plasmid profiles for transconjugant colonies were obtained by a modified alkaline lysis procedure and the eckhardt well-lysis procedure  <cit> . transconjugants were screened by pcr using primers to detect different regions of pa/c , px <dig>  and pstv  .

for recipient strains harboring resident plasmids  the transconjugant plasmids carrying blacmy- <dig> were transformed into dh5α using cro as selection. these dh5α transformants were used in the second round conjugation experiments and restriction analysis. the e. coli dh5α transformants carrying wild-type or transconjugant pa/c were digested with  <dig> u of psti  at 37°c for  <dig> hours, whereas dh5α transformants carrying wild-type or transconjugant px <dig> were simultaneously digested with  <dig> u of bamhi and ncoi  at 37°c for  <dig> hours. all restriction profiles were separated by electrophoresis in  <dig> % agarose gels for  <dig> hours at  <dig> v. the plasmid and restriction profiles were transferred to positively charged membranes  and were hybridized at 65°c with different pcr product probes labeled with α-32p-dctp by standard methods  <cit> .

design of px <dig> pcr screening and taxc phylogeny
we used the incx <dig> plasmid pou <dig> sequence as a reference to develop a pcr typing scheme for px <dig> . six regions were selected based on their functionality: two genes involved in plasmid replication, orix <dig>  spanning the replication region, and ydga coding for a type iii topoisomerase, and three genes essential for the conjugation of incx <dig> plasmids, taxb coding for the coupling protein, taxc coding for the relaxase, and ddp <dig> coding for an auxiliary transfer protein  <cit> . the sixth region comprised an intergenic region between two conserved orfs coding for hypothetical proteins with unknown function, designated as the 046- <dig> region, according to the annotation of these proteins in pou <dig>  the same primer sets were used for sequencing. the orix <dig>  taxc, ydga, taxb, ddp <dig> and 046- <dig> sequences for yu <dig> px <dig> were deposited in the genbank under accession numbers kc <dig> to kc <dig>  respectively. since the taxc gene was recently proposed as a marker for incx plasmids, we compared the taxc sequence of yu <dig> px <dig> with those retrieved by blast searches . phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using mega version  <dig>  <cit> .

generation of px <dig> mutant plasmids
several unsuccessful efforts were carried out to obtain the wild-type yu <dig> px <dig> by selection with different antibiotics. taking advantage of the high conjugation frequency reported for incx <dig> plasmids, we obtained the yu <dig> px <dig> by conjugation with dh5α using no antibiotic selection and pcr screening of colonies for the presence of orix <dig>  this wild-type yu <dig> px <dig> transconjugant  was used for hybridization experiments and to generate two mutants. to obtain a yu <dig> px <dig> with an antibiotic selection marker, random mutagenesis with the ez-tn5™ < kan-2 > tnp  was performed following the manufacturer's recommendation. the resultant dh5α strain acquired the tn <dig> transposon  <dig> pb upstream of stop codon in ydga gene, which coded for topoisomerase iii described in plasmid rp <dig> as a trae gene  <cit> ; the plasmid was named px1ydga::tn <dig>  a conjugation-defective mutant was generated by the insertion of a km resistance cassette  <cit>  into the taxb gene, coding for the coupling protein, which is essential for the successful conjugation of incx plasmids  <cit> . this plasmid was denominated px1taxb::km. finally, the two yu <dig> px <dig> mutant plasmids were transformed into dh5α-pa/c to produce dh5α strains harboring pa/c-px1ydga::tn <dig> and pa/c-px1taxb::km . these strains were used as donors to test the conjugation ability of pa/c and px <dig> using the conditions described in the conjugation experiments section.

RESULTS
pstv and pa/c stably co-exist in e. coli dh5α
our first approach to elucidate possible negative interactions between pstv and pa/c was to introduce both plasmids into e. coli laboratory strain dh5α. after transformation, the dh5α pstv::km-pa/c strain carrying both plasmids was sub-cultured for approximately  <dig> generations  and colonies were analyzed for resistance to cro and km. the resistance to cro and km was maintained for all the colonies analyzed, and they were positive for the pcr markers of pstv  and pa/c . the plasmid profiles of the colonies showed the presence of both plasmids . these results demonstrate the compatibility and stability of pstv and pa/c in dh5α during  <dig> generations.

yu <dig> transferred blacmy- <dig> at a low frequency and the presence of pstv had little effect
the yu <dig> strain carries five plasmids: the  <dig> kb pa/c that was previously analyzed  <cit> , and four plasmids of different sizes , for which no information was available. we determined the transfer frequency of pa/c from a st <dig> strain  to two st <dig> strains  and three e. coli laboratory strains . a schematic representation of the conjugation scheme is presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

yu <dig> transferred cro resistance to all five recipient strains, although at low frequencies, in the range of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig>   <cit> . the lower frequencies were recorded for the two typhimurium strains  and hb101pstv::km, suggesting that the presence of pstv had a slightly negative effect on the efficiency of cro resistance transfer. for all the recipients harboring pstv the presence of this plasmid in the transconjugants was verified by pcr  and the km resistance phenotype; a loss of pstv was never detected. the integrity of the pstv was observed by plasmid profiling and restriction analysis , suggesting that this plasmid was not affected by the entrance of a new plasmid.

transconjugant colonies were examined : all were positive for the amplification of blacmy- <dig> gene , but surprisingly, many were not positive for the amplification of the pa/c markers . the plasmid profiles of the transconjugants showed the following results: 1) in so <dig> and dh5α a large plasmid was found within the size range of pa/c , and in most cases a small plasmid of about  <dig> kb was observed; and 2) in lt <dig>  hb <dig> and hb101pstv most of the colonies showed a plasmid of about  <dig> kb, but in a few cases a large plasmid in the range of pa/c  and the small plasmid of about  <dig> kb were observed . the presence of such large plasmid correlated with those transconjugants positive for the pa/c markers, while the transconjugants harboring the  <dig> kb plasmid were negative. these results suggested that the  <dig> kb plasmid was a non-pa/c plasmid that acquired the blacmy- <dig> gene.

the yu <dig> cmy region from pa/c transposed to a co-resident px <dig> and was transferred to lt <dig> and hb <dig> recipients
to determine the genetic identity of the  <dig> kb transconjugant plasmids, the plasmid of a hb <dig> transconjugant  was restricted, cloned and selected with cro. the region surrounding the cmy region showed homology to sequences of incx <dig> plasmids . we selected pou <dig> as reference px <dig> plasmid . the sequence of the cloned region containing the blacmy- <dig> gene showed that it was inserted into an intergenic region between two orfs  annotated as hypothetical proteins. we designed primers to amplify the px <dig> replication region , and all the  <dig> kb transconjugant plasmids were positive, confirming that these were px <dig>  hybridizations using the orix <dig> probe on the plasmid profile of the yu <dig> donor strain showed that the  <dig> kb band corresponded to the px <dig>  these results showed that in yu <dig> the cmy region moved from pa/c to px <dig>  and then was transferred to lt <dig> and hb <dig> 

eight px <dig> transconjugants carrying the cmy region  were selected for detailed analysis . we developed a pcr typing scheme for six regions covering px <dig> . the px <dig> pcr screening of the transconjugants showed that four markers were present in all the transconjugants . three transconjugants were negative for the 046- <dig> section, and one was negative for ydga gene .

ctransconjugants were challenged for a second round of conjugation using as recipients the original recipient strain  or dh5α. the frequency was calculated as number of transconjugants per donor; the range in the orders of magnitude obtained is shown.

to address the extent of the cmy region transferred from pa/c to px <dig> we used the pcr typing scheme developed in our previous studies . four of the px <dig> transconjugants were positive for six of the seven genes present in the complete cmy region of pa/c , spanning from isecp <dig> to hypothetical protein  <dig> ; while the other four displayed a short version of the cmy region  including only isecp <dig>  blacmy- <dig>  blc and suge .

for the characterization of px <dig> transconjugants ic <dig>  id <dig> and iiid <dig>  that were negative for the 046- <dig> region, we used a combination of primers from the cmy region along with the primers for 046- <dig> to determine if this was the site of insertion . we successfully established that the ic <dig>  id <dig> and iiid <dig> transconjugants were positive for the cmy-046- <dig> junction . sequencing of these pcr products showed the exact insertion site for these px <dig> transconjugants harboring a large cmy region. the schematic representation of the insertion of the cmy region into 046- <dig> in ic <dig> is presented in figure 2a. mapping according to the pou <dig> annotation revealed that the insertion site was in nucleotide  <dig> . a repeat sequence of six nucleotides  flanking the cmy region was detected, corresponding to nucleotides  <dig>  to  <dig>  of pou <dig>  we discovered that the hypothetical protein  <dig> was truncated at nucleotide  <dig>  removing  <dig>  nucleotides of the complete orf.

on the other hand, transconjugant iiic <dig>  positive for the six px <dig> pcr markers and harboring a short version of the cmy region, was selected to determine the site of cmy insertion, using the same approach as for ic <dig>  the cloning and sequencing of the cmy region showed that in this plasmid the cmy region was inserted into the stbe gene, which is part of the stbde operon coding for the toxin-antitoxin segregation system of px <dig>  <cit> . based on this result, we designed primers to amplify the stbde operon, and these were used along with the short cmy region primers to test the other px1::cmy transconjugants . positive results for px1::cmy transconjugants iiic <dig>  ivd <dig> and iie <dig> demonstrated the presence of the cmy-stbde junction . careful revision of the sequences showed that the target site of insertion was nucleotide  <dig>  and the signature left by the transposition event was a five bp repeat sequence  spanning from nucleotides  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the pou <dig> sequence annotation. in these short cmy regions the suge orf  was truncated at nucleotide  <dig> . the insertion site for px1::cmy transconjugants iic <dig> and iiie <dig> could not be determined, despite several efforts carried out using the above mentioned approaches .

restriction profiles for the eight px <dig> transconjugant plasmids using bamhi-ncoi enzymes displayed marked differences in comparison with the profile of wild-type yu <dig> px <dig> transformed into dh5α . these differences could be related to distinct insertion sites of the cmy region and other re-arrangements within px <dig> and await further studies.

theyu <dig> px <dig> mobilized in cis the blacmy-2-carrying pa/c to dh5α and few of the other recipient strains
during the pcr screening of the px <dig> transconjugants we discovered that all the pa/c transconjugants from dh5α were positive for the six px <dig> markers. the few pa/c positive transconjugants from hb <dig> were also positive for the six px <dig> markers, with the exception of transconjugant iiid <dig> which was positive only for orix <dig> and ydga . in the so <dig> recipient only pa/c positive transconjugants were obtained ; although the pcr screening for px <dig> in the  <dig> transconjugants showed that only iiia <dig> was positive .

bno transconjugants were detected under the detection level .

psti restriction profiles for the thirteen pa/c transconjugants selected for detailed analysis  showed that in some cases a distinct profile was generated in comparison with that of the wild-type yu <dig> pa/c transformed into dh5α . examples of the plasmid  and psti restriction profiles are shown .

in order to detect the presence of px <dig> in the pa/c transconjugants, bamhi-ncoi restriction digests were performed, since these enzymes were used to analyze px <dig>  most of the bands of the wild-type dh5α-pa/c were visible in the restriction profiles of the transconjugants, but new bands were also evident . when hybridized with the complete px <dig> as probe, positive signals in bands corresponding with the px <dig> restriction profile were obtained in most of the cases . so <dig> transconjugant ia <dig> was negative for the px <dig> hybridization, in agreement with the px <dig> pcr screening; whereas the lt <dig> transconjugant iiie <dig> produced hybridization signals, suggesting that this plasmid contained regions of px <dig> not included in the pcr scheme . these results indicate that, with the exception of iiid <dig> and iiie <dig>  in most of the cases complete px <dig> and pa/c formed co-integrates that were not resolved in the recipient strain. in any case, this finding indicates a type of cis-mobilization, in which the mobilized replicon is fused to a conjugative plasmid, which supplies both orit and the tra functions  <cit> .

we speculated that co-integration points between pa/c and px <dig> could be the intergenic region 046- <dig> or stbe, as for some px1::cmy transposition events. however, the amplification for these regions did not show evidence of insertions. in addition, the positive amplification of the right and left junctions of the cmy region  showed that this region remained inserted into the pa/c backbone, suggesting that the regions involved in pa/c + px <dig> co-integration were not those detected in px1::cmy.

the px1::cmy and pa/c + px <dig> plasmids transfer at high frequencies
the variability exhibited by the restriction profiles of the transconjugant plasmids  led us to ask whether these plasmids were still able to conjugate. for this purpose, the transconjugant plasmids were electroporated into dh5α and challenged for conjugation in a “second round”. dh5α was used as recipient strain along with the original recipient in which the transconjugant plasmid was obtained, and to distinguish these second round experiments the terms “dh5α” and “original” were used, respectively.

the second round conjugation frequencies in most of the eight px1::cmy were extremely high, on the order of 10- <dig> . these frequencies were three to seven orders of magnitude higher than the frequencies recorded in the first round of conjugations . in some cases the conjugation frequency was higher for the dh5α receptor than for the original receptor, the most drastic effect was observed for lt <dig> transconjugant plasmid of iiie <dig> .

the four pa/c that were negative for the px <dig> pcr markers were unable to transfer cro resistance in a second round of conjugation, whereas the eight pa/c + px <dig> that were positive for all the px <dig> pcr markers increased their second round conjugation frequencies by one to seven orders of magnitude . an exception was the so <dig> iiia <dig> plasmid, in which the original second round conjugation retained its first round low frequency, suggesting the existence of restrictions for the entrance pa/c + px <dig> to so <dig>  this result was later related to the observation that in so <dig> most of the pa/c transconjugants were negative for px <dig> markers .

the so <dig> pa/c transconjugants were non-conjugative and display plasmid re-arrangements
the analysis of the pa/c transconjugants from so <dig>  showed three salient features. first, the pcr and hybridization experiments showed that they did not contain genetic material from px <dig> . second, their restriction profiles were in most cases distinct from that of the wild-type pa/c , suggesting that different genetic re-arrangements were occurring within these plasmids. and third, when challenged in a second round experiment they were non-conjugative or below the detection level . we suppose that the re-arrangements presented by these plasmids could have arisen by recombination within each pa/c or by interaction with px <dig> within the donor strain, although px <dig> was not observed in so <dig>  the most plausible hypothesis is that co-integrates of pa/c and px <dig> plasmids were formed, but were not stable in so <dig> and the px <dig> was lost. incompatibility with the cryptic p <dig> plasmid present in the so <dig> recipient could not be ruled out, to explain the lack of px <dig> in these transconjugants.

the blacmy- <dig> gene carried in a non-conjugative pa/c was transferred by the highly conjugative px1
we had previously reported that although yu <dig> was able to transfer cro resistance to a dh5α recipient, a transformant dh5α strain with the yu <dig> pa/c  was unable to transfer cro resistance to a dh5α recipient  <cit> . in the present study we confirmed this result and found that dh5α-pa/c was also unable to transfer cro resistance to any of the other strains used as recipients . based on these results, we hypothesized that pa/c was not conjugative and that it was co-mobilized by the highly conjugative px <dig>  to test this hypothesis, conjugation experiments were designed using two px <dig> mutants. the px1ydga::tn <dig> was obtained by random mutagenesis to introduce a km resistance marker into px <dig>  and px1taxb::km which was created by directed mutagenesis to knockout taxb, coding for the coupling protein, indispensable for px <dig> conjugation  <cit> . each of these plasmids were introduced by transformation to dh5α-pa/c strains and challenged for conjugative transfer.

the px1ydga::tn <dig> displayed a very high conjugation frequency , as for many of the px1::cmy hybrids . the conjugation frequency for the dh5α strain carrying pa/c and px1ydga::tn <dig> was 10- <dig> when only km was used for transconjugant selection, but dropped to 10- <dig> when cro or km-cro were used for selection . the pcr analysis of the latter transconjugants showed that in all the cases the plasmids were positive for both pa/c and px <dig> markers, indicating that pa/c + px <dig> were recovered, in agreement with the expectations for a dh5α receptor . on the other hand, the dh5α strain carrying pa/c and px1taxb::km was unable to transfer any of the plasmids under km or cro selection, indicating that in the presence of a conjugative-defective px <dig> plasmid the pa/c was unable to transfer. in conjunction, these results support our hypothesis that px <dig> contributed the conjugation machinery for pa/c transfer.

we calculated that the transposition and co-integration events occurred within yu <dig> at frequencies between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  based on the difference between the conjugation frequency of pa/c + px <dig> and px1::cmy transconjugants  compared with that of px1ydga::tn <dig> . it is worth noting that these conjugation experiments involving a dh5α donor carrying pa/c and px <dig> produced the same results observed as when the yu <dig> wild-type strain was used as donor, indicating that the interaction between these plasmids did not require additional elements from the yu <dig> genome.

pcole1-like was preferentially trans-mobilized along with pa/c
to determine the genetic identity of the  <dig> kb plasmid the band was purified, digested and cloned. the sequences from the cloned fragments showed homology to the replication and mob genes of cole <dig> plasmids, indicating that the  <dig> kb was a cole1-like plasmid . pcr screening using specific primers to amplify the pcole1-like moba region  showed that yu <dig> and all the transconjugants displaying the  <dig> kb band were positive. the moba pcr product was employed as a probe to hybridize yu <dig> and transconjugants plasmid profiles. these hybridizations confirmed the identity of the  <dig> kb band and, in addition, showed that the pcole1-like was not involved in the formation of pa/c + x <dig> co-integrates or px1::cmy.

the pcole1-like was mobilized in trans with all the dh5α pa/c + x <dig>  with most of the so <dig> pa/c transconjugants and with a few px1::cmy transconjugants , indicating stable co-existence with pa/c and px <dig>  and with pstv when present.

the yu <dig> px <dig> is closely related to other e. coli and salmonella px1
the nucleotide sequences for the six regions selected for the px <dig> pcr screening showed that the yu <dig> px <dig> was highly similar to other px <dig> plasmids. in a recent study, johnson et al. proposed the use of the taxc sequence as a genetic marker to compare incx plasmids  <cit> . the phylogenetic inference obtained by the comparison of the taxc partial sequence of the yu <dig> px <dig> with those of incx plasmids showed that it was closely related to other e. coli and salmonella incx <dig> plasmids . similar phylogenetic reconstructions were observed for the other five yu <dig> px <dig> sequences .

discussion
in this paper we describe diverse interactions among pa/c, px <dig> and pcole1-like plasmids within a single strain. when strain yu <dig> was challenged for conjugation different phenomena were recorded, depending on the recipient strain. when blacmy- <dig> was transferred, three genetic interactions occurred at very low frequencies: 1) the co-integration of pa/c and px1; 2) the transposition of the cmy region from pa/c to px1; or 3) the rearrangement of pa/c. moreover, the trans-mobilization of the pcole1-like plasmid occurred in most of the cases. the general outcome of these processes was the transfer of the blacmy- <dig> gene from a non-conjugative pa/c to a highly conjugative px <dig> plasmid. both the resultant pa/c + px <dig> and px1::cmy plasmids acquired the capacity to spread esc resistance at very high levels by conjugation . this mode of cis-mobilization and transfer of the blacmy- <dig> gene has not been previously reported.

the outcome of conjugation was dependent on the recipient stain
distinct interactions occurred among the pa/c, px <dig> and pcole1-like plasmids within the donor yu <dig> strain, albeit at very low frequencies. one of the most surprising results was that these interactions were differentially “sampled” in a recipient-dependent manner. we would expect to find differences between typhimurium and e. coli due to the induced mutations carried by the e. coli laboratory strains . however, in general terms e. coli and typhimurium strains shared similar results: dh5α and so <dig> received and harbored pa/c and pcole1-like, while lt <dig> and hb <dig> received and harbored px <dig>  the study of the genetic interactions among pa/c, px <dig> and pcole1-like was beyond the scope of this study. the interactions between relaxases and the px <dig> coupling protein will be addressed in future studies. moreover, the complete sequencing of the yu <dig> genome and representative plasmid re-arrangements is underway.

co-integration of the non-conjugative pa/c with the highly conjugative px1
inca/c plasmids encoding multi-drug resistance have been extensively studied and are known for their diversity and plasticity  <cit> . several studies have determined that pa/c plasmids are prevalent in multi-drug resistant e. coli and salmonella enterica serovars  <cit> . currently, there are over twenty sequenced pa/c, and the acquisition of new antibiotic resistance determinants have been reported  <cit> . although these plasmids have been found in a wide range of enterobacteriaceae and a molecular signature-analysis has shown a broad evolutionary host range  <cit> , the evidence for their conjugation ability remains controversial. welch et al. analyzed the pa/c transfer ability for several salmonella serovars, and reported low to moderately high conjugation frequencies  along with non-conjugative plasmids  <cit> . however, the transconjugants obtained were not analyzed to confirm self-transmissibility. poole et al. studied the conjugative transferability of pa/c containing or lacking the blacmy- <dig> gene in salmonella newport, concluding that plasmids encoding blacmy- <dig> were rarely transferred compared with high conjugation frequencies when blacmy- <dig> was absent  <cit> . when pa/c was the only replicon no transconjugants were detected, and much higher conjugation frequencies, between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  were observed only when other plasmids were present and co-transferred, suggesting that other replicons are necessary for pa/c transfer  <cit> . call et al. also reported the failure of self-conjugation for e. coli and newport blacmy- <dig> positive pa/c  <cit> . several studies have suggested that the failure of transferability of blacmy- <dig> positive pa/c was due to the insertion of this gene within one of the tra regions  <cit> . however, par <dig> is an example of a blacmy- <dig> bearing pa/c for which transfer frequencies as high as 10- <dig> are recorded  <cit> .

in the present study, we report that the transferability of yu <dig> pa/c depends on the presence of yu <dig> px <dig>  our results support the notion that the pa/c  in the mexican typhimurium population are not self-transmissible  <cit> , and that an additional helper plasmid is required for successful transfer. similar results were found by subbiah et al. for e. coli strain h4h  <cit> . this strain conjugated the pa/c  at low frequency , yet when a dh10b strain harboring peh4h was used as donor no transconjugants were detected. when peh4h was combined with the h4h co-resident plasmid ptmpr in dh10b, however, transconjugants were obtained in the order of 10- <dig>  suggesting that peh4h was mobilized by ptmpr in the wild-type strain. these investigators also found that 2/ <dig> of the transconjugant population harbored either both plasmids or a large plasmid that presumably represented a chimera of these two plasmids  <cit> . we found that chimeric pa/c + px <dig> were formed during cis-mobilization of yu <dig> pa/c by px <dig>  it seems that the pa/c lacks an orit compatible with the conjugative type iv secretion systems of px <dig>  and when co-integrated with px <dig> a successful transfer was achieved. nevertheless, regardless of the recipient strain, in no case were the two plasmids observed in the transconjugant populations. these results suggest that the co-integrates were stable and not resolved; furthermore, these co-integrates maintained their architecture after a second round of conjugation.

acquisition of the cmy region by px1
incx plasmids have been less studied that inca/c plasmids, but their record extends through the pre-antibiotic era  <cit> . recent studies have focused on incx because of their implication in biofilm formation and drug-resistance in enterobacteriaceae <cit> . in salmonella, incx plasmids have been related to co-integrates with serotype-specific virulence plasmids. pog <dig> is a typhimurium virulence plasmid co-integrated with an incx conjugative plasmid carrying ampicillin and kanamycin resistance, which has been used in compatibility experiments among typhimurium strains  <cit> . pou <dig> is a dublin virulence plasmid that co-integrated with an incx plasmid similar to pou <dig>  <cit> . in serovar enteritidis, phage-type conversion has been demonstrated by the acquisition of incx plasmids, such as pog <dig> and pse <dig>  <cit> . all incx plasmids studied so far exhibit a type iv secretion system as part of their plasmid backbone  <cit> ; this feature enables horizontal transfer of these plasmids between host cells. the ability to induce biofilm formation and the expression of conjugative type iv secretion systems could have a synergistic effect that ultimately could be related to the pathogenic potential of a bacterium  <cit> . yu <dig> px <dig> was negative for the amplification of the biofilm-formation operon mrk  characteristic of px <dig> plasmids pmas <dig>  pola <dig> and pln126_ <dig>  <cit> . however, the laboratory cultures of yu <dig> and its px <dig> transformants and transconjugant exhibited a biofilm-formation-like halo, which could be the result of other fimbrial or outer membrane proteins carried by this plasmid. yu <dig> was originally isolated from an eight year old boy in yucatán with a systemic infection that presented severe thrombocytopenia and active bleeding  <cit> . the contribution of px <dig> to the pathogenic potential of yu <dig> will be addressed in further experimental research.

this is the first study to report the acquisition of an esc-resistance gene by an incx <dig> plasmid. the genetic contexts of blacmy- <dig> genes have been addressed over the last decade  <cit> . the core cmy region is composed of a transposon-like element consisting of a specific isecp1-blacmy-2-blc-suge structure. the genetic context of this structure varies in different plasmids, particularly for those genes downstream of suge <cit> . isecp <dig> codes for the transposase  that mobilizes the cmy region by the one-end transposition mechanism, which only requires the action of one is  <cit> . it is widely accepted that isecp <dig> may mobilize many antibiotic resistance genes by transposing adjacent to them, and then misreading its cognate ends during a second transposition event, with the effect of moving the adjacent genes  <cit> . the reports of variable surrounding regions of blacmy- <dig> gene could be explained by the misreading end-effects of isecp <dig> and their movement among different genetic backgrounds. this is consistent with our results in which we found different versions of the original yu <dig> cmy region in the px1::cmy transconjugant plasmids . this variability may reflect the outcome of different one-end transposition events. lartigue et al. reconstructed the process of mobilization of blactx-m genes by isecp1b in kluyvera ascorbata <cit> . they reported that isecp1b-blactx-m transposed at various insertion sites at frequencies of  × 10- <dig>  in all cases, genetic analysis of several transposition events revealed a 5-bp duplication that confirmed their acquisition by transposition  <cit> . no consensus sequence was identified among the  <dig> bp duplicated sites, whereas an at-rich content that may target isecp1b-mediated transposition was identified  <cit> . these results were highly similar to our own in which the calculated transposition frequency was in the range of 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> and the analysis of two px1::cmy displayed different duplications at at-rich regions, one of  <dig> bp and the other of  <dig> bp . our results provide evidence of in vivo mobilization of a clinically important antibiotic resistance gene  from a non-conjugative pa/c to a highly conjugative px <dig> 

the insertion site for three px1::cmy, carrying the “large” version of the cmy region, was the intergenic region between two orfs with unknown function, here referred to as  <dig> and  <dig>  based on the annotation of the reference plasmid pou <dig>  this intergenic region is conserved in most of the sequenced incx plasmids and is located in the region where the “genetic load” operons are frequently inserted   <cit> . the insertion site for three px1::cmy carrying the “short” version of the cmy region was stbe, which is the second gene of the stbde operon involved in the plasmid addiction system. in toxin-antitoxin stability systems, the toxic activity of one protein is normally repressed by the partner antitoxin, when a plasmid-free variant arises, the antitoxin decays more rapidly than the toxin, and this releases the latter to act on its intracellular target, which results in cell death or stasis  <cit> . therefore, inactivation of stbe toxin by the cmy region insertion was not lethal to the bacterial host. the fact that two px1::cmy transconjugants for which the cmy insertion site could not be determined, evidence that other px <dig> regions might be targets for isecp <dig> transposition. our results suggest that transposition occurs more or less randomly in at-rich regions of px <dig>  but only those not affecting replication and conjugation could be recovered in our conjugation experiments.

increased conjugation frequency of pa/c + px <dig> and px1::cmy
our experiments demonstrate that yu <dig> px <dig> conjugates at a very high frequency . the pa/c + px <dig> and px1::cmy transconjugants also exhibited high frequencies when challenged for a second round of conjugation . the differences in conjugation frequencies among pa/c + px <dig> and px1::cmy transconjugants with those of px <dig>  led us to determine that the transposition and co-integration events occurred within yu <dig> at frequencies ranging between 10- <dig> and 10- <dig>  which were in the range of those reported for other transposition or co-integration events  <cit> . these results indicated that the first round conjugation frequencies combined the low frequency of co-integration or transposition with the high frequency of conjugation of px <dig> ; while the second round conjugations directly measured the conjugation frequencies of pa/c + px <dig> or px1::cmy, which were high in most of the cases due to the use of the px <dig> conjugative machinery .

trans-mobilization of pcole1-like
the mobilization capacities of cole <dig> related plasmids have been recognized for decades, and plasmids from several incompatibility groups have been shown to mobilize them  <cit> . cole1-like plasmids are prevalent in salmonella serovars  <cit> , and most of them carry the km resistance gene aph <cit> .

the yu <dig> pcole1-like did not confer km resistance nor to any other of the yu <dig> antibiotic resistances tested . despite the high frequency of transfer of the pcole1-like plasmids, our hybridization assays demonstrated that this plasmid was not involved in the genetic re-arrangements displayed by pa/c and px <dig>  or the acquisition of the blacmy- <dig> gene. taken together, these results suggest that pcole1-like is a very efficient molecular parasite. however, only the determination of its complete nucleotide sequence could provide information regarding the presence of a gene increasing the fitness of its host bacteria.

epidemiological implications
our study demonstrated that pstv and pa/c can indeed co-exist within e. coli and typhimurium strains. therefore, our original epidemiological observations that each of these plasmids was restricted to distinct genotypes  <cit>  cannot be explained by negative interactions between them. in our previous studies we showed that the only strain capable of conjugative transfer of blacmy- <dig> was yu <dig>  <cit> . we screened the mexican population for the presence of px <dig>  but yu <dig> was the only positive strain , explaining why the other st <dig> pa/c lacked the capacity to be transferred. we hypothesize that pa/c emerged in st <dig>  which is a genotype lacking pstv, and that the non-conjugative pa/c failed to colonize st <dig> strains. the widespread dissemination of pa/c and blacmy- <dig> in the st <dig> population by the action of yu <dig> px <dig> is a rare, but not negligible, event. future epidemiological studies designed to track the prevalence of px <dig> in the mexican populations will shed light on these interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence of in vivo mobilization of a clinically important antibiotic resistance gene  from a non-conjugative pa/c to a highly conjugative px <dig>  this work highlights the diverse possibilities that a single strain is capable to exploit, in order to contend with the challenge of horizontal gene transfer and antibiotic selective pressure.
