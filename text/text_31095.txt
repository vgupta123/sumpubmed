BACKGROUND
prenylation is a stable lipid modification process involving covalent addition of either farnesyl  or geranylgeranyl  isoprenoids to conserved cysteine residues at or near the c-terminus of proteins  <cit> . it is believed that about 2% of eukaryotic cell proteins are modified by prenylation  <cit> , which is accomplished by three distinct heterodimeric protein isoprenyltransferases. protein with the carboxyl-terminal residue of the caax motif, where "a" refers to the aliphatic residue, is recognized either by farnesyltransferase  when "x" is methionine, glutamine, serine, alanine, or cysteine, or by geranylgeranytransferase type i  when "x" is leucine or isoleucine  <cit> . ftase and ggtase i are cytosolic enzymes utilizing farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate as the isoprenyl donors, respectively  <cit> . the third isoprenyltransferase is geranylgeranytransferase type ii , which transfers two geranylgeranyl groups from geranylgeranyl diphosphate to the carboxyl terminal cysteine residues of xccxx, xxcxc, xxccx, xxxcc, xcxxx or ccxxx motifs  <cit> . all three enzymes have been found in eukaryotes including protozoans, metazoans, fungi, and plants. in the plant kingdom, these enzymes have been reported in different species such as pea   <cit> , tomato   <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ftase and ggtase i share a common α-subunit encoded by a single gene plp   <cit> , whereas the genes encoding the β-subunit of ftase and ggtase i are era <dig>   <cit>  and ggb   <cit> , respectively.

following prenylation by ftase or ggtase i in cytoplasm, proteins are usually subject to further maturation processing in the endoplasmic reticulum , including cleavage of the 'aax' residues by endoproteases and methylation of the newly created carboxyl terminal residue cysteine by isoprenylcycteine methyltransferase   <cit> . in arabidopsis, two genes encoding caax endoprotease, atste <dig>  and atface- <dig> , have been identified  <cit> . similarly, two icmt genes, atste14a  and atste14b , have also been characterized  <cit> . using s-adenosyl-l-methionine as a methyl donor, atste14a and atste14b catalyze the methylation of biologically relevant isoprenylcysteine substrates, i.e. farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine, but not geranylcysteine  <cit> .

biochemically, protein prenylation and subsequent mature processing steps increase its c-terminal hydrophobicity, which facilitate its attachment to membrane and, in some cases, promoting protein-protein interactions  <cit> . physiologically, these protein lipid modifications including prenylation and subsequent methylation exert profound effects on diverse processes involving signal transduction and intracellular trafficking pathways  <cit> . in arabidopsis, protein isoprenylation and its processing steps are involved in hormone metabolism and signaling, such as cytokinin biosynthesis, abscisic acid  and auxin signaling, meristem development, innate immunity, and other fundamental processes  <cit> .

as protein function can be modulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, it is believed that methylation of isoprenlated protein can be reversible by isoprenylcysteine methylesterase , and only this step can be reversible during protein prenylation and processing  <cit> . indirect evidence showed that those cell membranes that can methylate prenylated protein are also capable of demethylating prenylated amino acids n-acetyl-s-farnesyl-l-cysteine  <cit> . recently, deem et al.  <cit>  identified an icme coding gene at5g <dig> in arabidopsis. two related arabidopsis genes, at1g <dig> and at3g <dig>  were also reported in their study.

according to the latest version of tair <dig>  released at june  <dig>   <dig>  there are two at3g <dig> splice variants,  <dig> and  <dig> bases, encoding two distinct protein products http://www.arabidopsis.org. the  <dig> base at3g <dig>  transcript is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide while the  <dig> base at3g <dig>  transcript is predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid polypeptide. proteins encoded by both splice variants are different from the one reported by deem et al  <cit>  in which at3g <dig> was predicted to encode a  <dig> amino acid with no predicted trans-membrane domain. the at1g <dig> and at5g <dig> data in tair <dig> is consistent with deem et al  <cit> , which highlights two at5g <dig> splice variants encoding two distinct protein products and one single at1g <dig> splice form http://www.arabidopsis.org.

the icme activity was reported in arabidopsis membrane fractions  <cit> , although the precise sub-cellular localization of this protein remains unknown. overexpressing icme in arabidopsis resulted in an aba hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed germination, indicating icme is a positive regulator of aba signaling. furthermore, the expression of this icme gene can be induced by aba after  <dig> hr treatment  <cit> . despite these, knowledge about the protein's sub-cellular localization and expression patterns remains unavailable. moreover, studies on this gene in response to other abiotic stresses have not been conducted.

in the present study, the icme and two icme-like proteins, icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig> encoded by respective at1g <dig> and at3g <dig>  were characterized including their sub-cellular localization, tissue-specific expression patterns and responses to different abiotic stresses and aba. the biological function of icme-like <dig> was explored by t-dna knock out mutant.

RESULTS
characterization and clustering analysis of icme gene family in arabidopsis
since the gene product of at5g <dig> was identified as icme  <cit> , we named the gene products of at1g <dig> and at3g <dig> as icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig>  respectively. to confirm the coding sequences deposited in public databases, the open reading frame  of these genes were obtained by rt-pcr. we successfully determined a  <dig> base orf for at1g <dig>  a  <dig> base and a  <dig> base orfs for respective at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  the amplified pcr products were cloned into pgemt-easy vector and sequenced. sequencing results showed the orf sequences of three genes are the same as those released by tair <dig>  for at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  the two orf sequences corresponded to at3g <dig>  http://www.arabidopsis.org and at5g <dig>   <cit> , the longer variants of the two genes. for this reason, in this study, we only focused our interests on the longer splice variants for both at3g <dig> and at5g <dig>  the amino acid sequences were derived from these orfs and multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the three proteins was performed using clustal w <dig> program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/es/cgi-bin/clustalw <dig>  results revealed that these three proteins were highly similar: icme-like <dig> shared 59% and 61% amino acid identity with icme-like <dig> and icme, respectively, while icme-like <dig> and icme had 76% identity . prosite software analysis http://www.expasy.ch/prosite showed that all proteins contained a highly conserved catalytic triad: a serine, an aspartate and a histidine  as well as substrate binding pocket domains, gga and qsa . conserved domain search http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi showed that all three proteins belong to the esterase lipase superfamily , while icme-like <dig> and icme contain carboxylesterases type-b serine active site with perfect pattern: f--g-x --x--x-g-x-s--g http://www.expasy.ch/prosite.

using these three proteins as search query, similar proteins with more than 50% identity from plant kingdom were retrieved from ncbi through blastp  <cit>  for the purpose of evaluating the evolutionary relationship among these proteins. phylogenetic tree were constructed using several tree building programs, including neighbor joining , minimum evolution  and maximum parsimony , which are available at the mega <dig> website http://www.megasoftware.net. clustering analysis showed that different methods yielded similar clustering patterns. the results obtained with nj method were presented  and results obtained with me and mp methods can be found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. results showed that the icme and two icme-like proteins together with similar proteins, np _ <dig> from zea mays, baf <dig> and baf <dig> from oryza sativa, cao <dig> from vitis vinifera, and abd <dig> from cleome spinose, could be classified into one group with 100% bootstrap support. the group is divergent from two other groups, including the previously reported  <dig> arabidopsis carboxylesterases   <cit>  and those that function as a suppressor of avrbst-elicited resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> . the analysis demonstrated that the icme genes in arabidopsis belong to a small gene family.

icmes of arabidopsis are targeted to er and golgi apparatus
trans-membrane domain was predicted using several online programs listed in table  <dig> 

das
hmmtop
sosui
tmpred
tmhhm
as a result, except for sosui program that predicted icme as a soluble protein, all other programs predicted that the three proteins all contain at least one trans-membrane domain . to provide experimental evidence of the sub-cellular localization of icme and its homologs, a transient expression of gfp-fused icme and its homologs into onion epidermal cells and n. benthamiana protoplasts that isolated from suspension cultured cells, was performed. similar sub-cellular localization patterns of the icme family were obtained in these two systems . as shown in figures 2a and 2b, when co-expressing the free gfp gene with the er or golgi marker genes, the gfp fluorescence was spread throughout the cell  with stronger signals in the nucleus , which was partially overlapped with the desred fluorescence emitted by the er marker bip-rfp  and golgi marker st-mrfp . when co-expressing the gfp fused icme-like <dig> with the er and golgi markers in protoplasts, besides small green punctates, the gfp fluorescence was predominantly restricted in the er and golgi apparatus, which was confirmed by co-localizing with the er marker bip-rfp  and the golgi marker st-mrfp . icme-like <dig> showed as an er-resident protein  with partially localizing in the golgi apparatus . some fluorescent vesicles were observed surrounding the golgi apparatus after gfp was fused to icme-like <dig> in some protoplasts . similarly, icme was predominantly localized in the er and golgi apparatus .

when the trans-membrane domain of the icme family was predicted by using tmhhm program, both icme and its homologs were found to contain one trans-membrane domain . for icme, amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> were predicted as a trans-membrane helix. when this region was deleted and the mutant was fused to gfp followed by expression in protoplasts, the gfp fluorescence was still limited in er and golgi apparatus, which was confirmed by co-localizing with the er and golgi apparatus makers .

tissue-specific expression patterns of icme gene family
to examine the tissue-specific expression of icme and its homologs, total rna was extracted from different tissues including roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques of 4- <dig> weeks old plants, followed by further treatment with dnase to remove the possible trace genomic dna. one microgram of dna-free rna was converted into cdna and semi-quantitative rt-pcr or real-time quantitative rt-pcr  was performed.

both semi-quantitative rt-pcr  and qpcr  results showed that all icme genes are constitutively expressed in all examined tissues with differentiated expression levels . the steady-state messenger rna  level of icme was low in the stems but high in the reproductive organs including flowers and siliques . for icme-like <dig>  it showed the highest mrna level in the leaves but the lowest in the stems . overall, transcript abundance of the icme-like <dig> gene was quite low; the mrna level of icme-like <dig> was much lower than that of icme and icme-like <dig> in all tested tissues , which was hardly detectable, especially in the vegetative organs including roots, leaves and stems, with semi-quantitative rt-pcr of less pcr cycles .

expression profiles of icme gene family in response to abiotic stresses and aba
time-course expression profiles of the icme gene family in response to different abiotic stresses including cold , heat , drought , mannitol , nacl , and aba  were determined using qpcr. overall, cold treatment resulted in no significant expression change of the icme family . the icme-like <dig> expression was slightly up-regulated by cold treatment after  <dig> min. in contrast, the expression of icme-like <dig> gene was slightly down-regulated by cold treatment after  <dig> min and recovered to the pre-treatment level after  <dig> min. similar to the icme-like <dig> gene, under cold treatment, the icme gene was slightly down-regulated quickly and then up-regulated.

in contrast to the response to the cold treatment, the expression of the icme-like <dig> gene was down-regulated during heat treatment , which could be applied to the icme-like <dig> gene . however, upon heat treatment, transcript of icme showed a quick and transient increase. after  <dig> min of heat treatment, the icme expression reached the maximum . at  <dig> min of heat treatment, the icme expression was recovered to near the pre-treatment levels. from the expression profile, it is obvious that icme is a quick and early response gene during heat stress, indicating that icme may play an important role in the response of plants to heat stress.

when suffered from drought stress, both icme and its homologs exhibited similar responses. overall, the transcript abundance of these genes was not changed significantly except that at  <dig> min and  <dig> min of drought stress. the transcripts of icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig> decreased at  <dig> min of treatment; whereas the transcripts of icme and icme-like <dig> increased at  <dig> min after treatment .

as shown in figure 4d, in general, both icme and its homologs were elevated by osmotic stress induced by mannitol treatment with differential levels of increase. among them, the icme gene showed the most pronounced up-regulation. at  <dig> hr of treatment, the expression of icme reached the maximum with its transcript abundance being at least  <dig> times of that of the pre-treatment. at  <dig> hr of treatment, the expression of icme-like <dig> was maximally induced and this induction was lasted for  <dig> hrs. the icme-like <dig> gene was induced at  <dig> hr of treatment and was maximally induced at  <dig> hr of treatment.

upon nacl treatment, the expression profile of icme and its homologs was similar to that in response to mannitol treatment. as shown in figure 4e, both icme and its homologs were up-regulated by nacl treatment, with icme showing the strongest up-regulation. moreover, the transcript of icme increased quickly. the expression of icme started increase at  <dig> hr of treatment and reached the maximum at  <dig> hr. similarly, after  <dig> hr treatment, the expression of icme-like <dig> was maximally induced and this induction was lasted until  <dig> hr of treatment. in contrast, icme-like <dig> was induced at  <dig> hr of treatment and the expression reached the maximum at  <dig> hr of treatment.

as shown in figure 4f, the expression of both icme and its homologs was increased in response to aba. among them, icme and icme-like <dig> showed the most and the least pronounced up-regulation by aba, respectively. interestingly, transcript abundance of icme-like <dig> fluctuated during the course of aba treatment, i.e, the transcript increased at  <dig> hr and backed to the pre-treatment level at  <dig> hr and then increased again at  <dig> hr after treatment. in contrast, the transcript of icme showed a regular pattern; it increased at  <dig> hr and reached the maximum at  <dig> hr of aba treatment.

identification of t-dna insertion lines
to explore the biological functions of the icme family, t-dna insertion mutant lines were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . for each gene, two different t-dna insertion lines were analyzed. a homozygous t-dna insertion line, salk_ <dig>  with a t-dna inserted at the 3' utr of icme-like <dig> was identified by genomic dna pcr and sequencing. however, this insertion neither disrupts the expression nor causes down-expression of icme-like <dig>  another line, salk_ <dig> , was identified without any insertions at icme-like <dig>  although the seeds could grow on kanamycin containing ms medium and the transcript of neomycin phosphotransferase gene was also amplified by rt-pcr from total rna extracted from this line. these results suggested that this line is a t-dna insertion line with the t-dna inserted at other unknown position. in contrast, the homozygous t-dna insertion lines, salk_ <dig>  and salk_ <dig>  with a t-dna inserted at the 8th and 10th intron of icme-like <dig>  respectively, were identified by genomic dna pcr and sequencing . the expression of icme-like <dig> was disrupted by both insertions . similarly, the homozygous t-dna insertion lines, salk_ <dig>  and salk_ <dig>  with a t-dna inserted at the 1st intron and 11th exon of icme, respectively, were identified by genomic dna pcr and sequencing . gene expression analysis showed that no transcripts  of icme were detected in the two homozygous mutants .

overall, icme-like2- <dig>  icme-like2- <dig>  icme- <dig> and icme- <dig> mutants are not distinguishable from wild-type plants in appearance under normal growth conditions .

moreover, all of them exhibited similar responses when subjected to drought and salt stresses.

disruption of icme-like <dig> expression leads to increased sensitivity to aba but slightly decreased to salt and osmotic stresses in seed germination
seed germination of the wild type and icme-like <dig> mutants in response to aba, salt and osmotic stresses was examined. both icme-like2- <dig> and icme-like2- <dig> showed similar responses to the treatments. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the absence of aba, no differences of germination were observed between wild type and icme-like2- <dig> mutant. by contrast, disruption of icme-like <dig> expression leads to an increased sensitivity to aba in seed germination, and the aba-sensitive phenotype was apparent at all concentrations of aba tested. on the other hand, the wild-type and the icme-like <dig> mutant showed no significant differences of cotyledon greening and seedling root growth . in addition, in the low concentration of exogenous aba, the difference was only observed in a short span during the early time of seed germination; whereas the differences were lasted for a much longer time in the high concentrations of aba.

in contrast to respond to aba, overall, the icme-like2- <dig> mutant showed slightly decreased sensitivity to salt  and osmotic  stresses in seed germination compared to the wild type. but these differences are significant only under specific concentration and stage , suggesting that icme-like <dig> exerts its role in specific conditions and developmental stage in response to environmental stimuli. similarly, the wild-type and the icme-like <dig> mutants showed no significant differences of cotyledon greening and seedling root growth in response to these stresses.

discussion
icme is involved in the process of demethylating the prenylated proteins in eukaryotic cells. an icme was recently reported in arabidopsis and its related gene was isolated  <cit> . membranes isolated from s. cerevisiae cells expressing the icme gene contain specific enzyme activity for relevant prenylcysteine methylesters  <cit> . overexpression of icme resulted in an aba hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed germination  <cit> . moreover, this gene was up-regulated by aba in arabidopsis seedlings  <cit> . these results indicate that the demethylation of prenylated proteins is involved in at least some aspects, if not all, of aba responses and icme is a positive regulator of aba signaling.

structurally, both icme and its homologs in this study belong to the esterase lipase superfamily containing two highly conserved regions:  the gxsxg motif containing the ser nucleophile ; and  the conserved catalytic triad possessing the nucleophile-acid-his-ordered sequence  . initially, we identified icme as an acetylcholinesterase -like protein with the attempt to clone the gene encoding ache-like protein in planta since the ache-like activity was detected in maize seedlings  <cit> . until now, it is still unclear whether icme and its two homologs, icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig>  possess enzyme activity to hydrolyze acetylthiocholine. in  <dig>  an ache  with  <dig> amino acids in length from maize seedlings was identified and the related gene was cloned  <cit> . this ache contains the same conserved catalytic core as in the animal ache, possessing the enzyme activity of hydrolyzing acetylthiocholine and propyonylthiocholine, but not s-butyrylthiocholine. moreover, its enzyme activity was totally inhibited by neostigmine bromide, a specific inhibitor of animal ache  <cit> . however, the amino acid sequence of this ache showed no apparent similarity with that of the animal enzyme. based on these, the authors proposed that this ache family is a novel family of enzymes in plant kingdom. amino acid sequence alignment showed icme and its homologs were exhibited very lower similarity with that of the maize ache , suggesting that icme and its homologs are not ache-like proteins. in  <dig>  twenty carboxylesterases in arabidopsis  were systemically mined from arabidopsis genome, and the expression profile across a range of tissues was detected by rt-pcr  <cit> . one of atcxes, atcxe <dig>  was reported to possess enzyme activity for hydrolyzing the pro-herbicide methyl- <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetate to the phytotoxic acid  <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid  <cit> . it remains unknown whether icme and its homologs have such enzyme activity to hydrolyze pro-herbicide methyl- <dig> -dichlorophenoxyacetate. although all the  <dig> atcxes contains the conserved catalytic triad, amino acid sequence alignment showed that icme and its homologs are divergent from those atcxes. moreover, none of atcxes is larger than  <dig> amino acids in length but icme and its homologs are larger than  <dig> amino acids in length. in addition, icme and its homologs are lack of the conserved sequence surrounding the motif known as the oxyanion hole in atcxes. phylogenetic analysis further showed that icme and its homologs and atcxes are clustered into different groups, respectively . these indicate that icme and its homologs may not possess the enzyme activity of atcxes. in  <dig>  another carboxylesterase, sober <dig> , was identified as suppressors of avrbst-elicited resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> . sober <dig> and its homologs are also clustered into an independent group . enzymes in this group are smaller than that of atcxes and icme and its homologs are less than  <dig> amino acids in length. besides the conserved catalytic triad, enzymes in this group contain another unique "lhglgd" motif in the n-terminal region that is not present in the icme and its homologs. in summary, bioinformatic analysis in this study and previous biochemical evidence  <cit>  suggest that icme and its homologs may comprise a novel small subfamily of carboxylesterase in plant kingdom, possibly with the prenylated protein as its specific substrate. given the high degree of similarity among icme, icme-like <dig>  and icme-like <dig> in terms of sequence and subcellular localization , it is reasonable to predict that icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig> possess icme activity. direct biochemical evidence of icme activity of the icme-like proteins is necessary for better understanding their functions in plants in the future.

documented data suggested that protein prenylation and subsequent mature processing steps promote its attachment to membrane and, in some cases, protein-protein interaction by increasing its c-terminal hydrophobicity  <cit> . in other words, with high possibility, a maturely prenylated protein is a membrane protein or is associated with the membrane system. icme is involved in demthylation of the prenylated proteins, the only reversible process during protein prenylation modification. these suggest that icme is likely a membrane-resident protein. previous biochemical analysis also showed that enzyme activity of icme was detected in membrane fragment  <cit> . in the current study, more precise sub-cellular localizations of icme family were provided using gfp tagged proteins. initially, we fused all icme and its homologs in frame to the n-terminus of gfp. except for icme, we failed to detect any fluorescent signal for gfp tagged icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig>  suggesting that n-terminus fused gfp may be unstable. we then fused these two proteins to the c-terminus of gfp and successfully detected the fluorescence. the fluorescent signals clearly revealed that proteins of the icme family are intramembrane proteins predominantly localizing at the er and golgi apparatus, which was confirmed by co-expression of er and golgi markers, bip-rfp and st-mrfp, respectively . these results also suggest that many prenylated proteins, at least those that being in the processes of demthylation, are targeted to er and golgi apparatus. subcellular proteomics of er and golgi apparatus may provide more information about protein prenylation and its mature process, which will be helpful to explore the biological functions of protein prenylation.

when transiently expressing gfp-icme-like <dig>  some green vesicles surrounding the golgi apparatus were observed in some protoplasts . at present, the significance of these vesicles is unclear. we speculated that  these vesicles were secreted from er and being sorted to the golgi apparatus for its post-translational modifications. motif scanning showed that icme-like <dig> could be modified by glycosylation  and other potential manners http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan;  these vesicles modified in the golgi apparatus were being sorted to its final target, er. further cell biology experiments, especially pharmacogenetic analysis, are needed to reveal the mechanisms underlying these vesicles.

contrary results were obtained in predicting the trans-membrane domain of icme by using different programs . zero and five transmembrane domains were predicted for icme with sosui and tmpred programs, respectively. deleting the putative transmembrane helix, amino acids 102nd to 124th, did not block its er-targeting. it can be concluded from this that icme is an intramembrane protein containing at least two transmembrane domains and predominantly localizing in the er and golgi apparatus.

so far, the molecular information about the icme family is unavailable except that the expression of icme was up-regulated in arabidopsis seedlings by aba after  <dig> hrs. there is also a lack of information about the expression profiles for icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig> in the public database. study here showed that the members of the icme family are expressed across a range of tissues with differential expression level , indicating that icme and its homologs may have broad functions in arabidopsis. on the other hand, this also suggests the existence of functional redundancy among the icme family. the base transcript of icme-like <dig> is quite low, indicating it is a low abundance gene. the low detection sensitive of northern blotting may explain why there is no public microarray data available. it is also possible that the expression of icme-like <dig> is indistinguishable from icme due to their high similarity, leading to lack of expression information on icme-like <dig> in the public microarray data. lacking of the expression information on icme-like <dig> in the public microarray data is unexpected since its base transcript abundance is similar to that of icme . moreover, the transcript increased in response to cold, salt, osmotic stresses and aba treatment . the most possible explanation for this is that the expression of icme-like <dig> is indistinguishable from icme because of their high similarity.

by time-course assays, study here not only confirmed the previous data that icme was up-regulated by aba treatment after  <dig> hr  <cit> , but also provided that icme is also a stress-regulated gene, which is consistent with the public micoarray data https://www.genevestigator.com/gv/directlink.jsp?geneids=at5g <dig>  in addition, icme was dramatically up-regulated by other abiotic stresses, including heat, mannitol, and salt treatment, suggesting that icme might be involved in stress response. indeed, prenylated proteins have been implicated in the processes in response to heat stress  <cit> . although study here showed that disruption the expression of icme  caused no different phenotypes between wild type and mutant plants under normal and drought and salt stress conditions , whether the icme activity is required for tolerating heat stress is to be confirmed with icme mutants, icme and icme-like <dig> double mutants and transgenic plants bearing over-expression of icme.

by now, the biological functions of the icme family are largely unclear; the only confirmed function is that the over-expression of icme caused an aba hypersensitive phenotype in stomatal closure and seed germination while icme- <dig> mutant exhibited an aba insensitive phenotype  <cit> . this is different from our data using icme-like <dig> mutants. knocking out the expression of icme-like <dig> resulted in increased sensitivity to aba in seed germination . these suggest that icme and icme-like <dig> may have different roles in seed germination in response to aba. however, except that the disruption of icme-like <dig> expression leads to increased sensitivity to aba and slightly decreased to salt and osmotic stresses in seed germination, no significant differences were observed between wild type and mutant plants in terms of other physiological functions tested. similarly, no significant differences were observed between wild type and icme mutants in other biological process in previous study  <cit> , which has been confirmed in the current study . this may be due to the existence of functional redundancy among the icme family. firstly, the expression of the icme family is universal; secondly, the sub-cellular localizations of the icme family are similar; thirdly, the expression patterns of the icme family in response to abiotic stresses and aba is similar; and finally, the members of the icme family share high identity in amino acid and contain the conserved functional domain. the biological process of icme-like <dig> is worth further detailed study. some important facts about icme-like <dig> include  it is a low abundance gene ;  its transcript abundance is induced by abiotic stresses and aba ;  it forms some vesicles around er ; and  null mutants of icme-like <dig> are available . based on these, it can be predicted that icme-like <dig> and icme-like <dig> are involved in aba signaling and may also be involved in other stress responses. to better understand the biological functions of the icme family, future works will be to identify null or knock-down mutant of icme-like <dig> and construct double and triple mutants of the icme family.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, the extended characterizations, sub-cellular localizations, expression profiles across different tissues and in response to abiotic stress and aba of icme and its homologs as well as their physiological functions are reported. these studies confirmed that there is a small icme family with specific structural characterizations in arabidopsis. all members of the family have similar sub-cellular localizations predominantly localizing at the er and golgi apparatus. the genes of the icme family are expressed across a broad range of tissues. upon stress stimuli and aba treatment, most of the expressions of the imce family are up-regulated. single mutants of icme and icme-like <dig> do not show significant effects in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stimuli. however, disruption of the icme-like <dig> expression leads to increased sensitivity to aba and slightly decreased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stresses in seed germination. double and triple mutants of the icme family may be better option to explore their functions in future. the aba and abiotic stress regulated genes reported here are potentially useful resources for transgenic crops against drought and other stresses.
