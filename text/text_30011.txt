BACKGROUND
the scavenger receptors  are a structurally diverse group of pattern recognition receptors  which were originally defined based on their ability to bind and subsequently internalize acetylated low-density lipoprotein . these receptors have since been shown to have the ability to bind some  polyanions
 <cit>  including ligands on modified host proteins and apoptotic cells
 <cit> . since their initial discovery in 1979
 <cit> , a variety of proteins have been included in the sr family based on their ligand binding capabilities and/or similarities in their secondary structures, resulting in a diverse family of seemingly unrelated proteins
 <cit> . consequently, in  <dig> krieger suggested that the srs be divided into  <dig> distinct classes, termed a through h, on the basis of protein sequence comparisons and domain architecture
 <cit> . the class a scavenger receptors  consist of  <dig> original members, namely scavenger receptor class a i  and macrophage receptor with collagenous domain 
 <cit> . three additional members have been subsequently added: scavenger receptor class a, member  <dig> /csr , scara4/srcl , and scara5
 <cit> . the ca-srs are type ii glycoproteins consisting of an intracellular n-terminal domain and extracellular c-terminus
 <cit> . all  <dig> members form homotrimers that are thought to be stabilized via α-helical coiled-coil motifs in addition to their collagenous regions
 <cit> . in general, the ca-srs have similar domain structures with some obvious exceptions at the c-terminal end . these proteins vary considerably in the length of their collagenous domains, ranging from approximately  <dig> residues in scara <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in marco
 <cit> . importantly, the c terminus domain varies between the members of this group. srai, marco, and scara <dig> possess a terminal scavenger receptor cysteine rich  domain
 <cit> , whereas scara <dig> terminates at the collagenous domain
 <cit> , and scara <dig> possesses a c-type lectin domain
 <cit> .
 <cit> . domain boundaries are supported by additional file
1: table s <dig> 

alongside the c-type lectin domain of the collectins
 <cit>  and the leucine-rich repeat of the toll-like receptors 
 <cit> , the srcr domain is one of the most ancient pattern recognition domains associated with innate immunity
 <cit> . this domain possesses  <dig> highly conserved cysteine residues resulting in a distinctive pattern of disulfide bonding
 <cit> .

the srcr domain is not restricted to the ca-srs and is instead part of many other proteins across deuterosomes. these other srcr-containing proteins have been implicated in a wide variety of functions, including pathogen recognition, endocytosis, and immune response homeostasis ; however, the role of the srcr domain in the ca-srs remains unclear. studies of marco and srai implicate a region of the srcr domains as a potential ligand binding motif
 <cit> . in contrast, other mutagenic studies have shown that the collagenous region is sufficient for the binding of acldl
 <cit> . whether this discrepancy is due to the particular ligands examined and/or multiple binding motifs is unknown.

while srai and marco are primarily expressed on macrophages
 <cit> , scara <dig>  scara <dig>  and scara <dig> are expressed on a variety of other cell types, including epithelial cells
 <cit> , and cells of the placenta, lungs, heart, and small intestine
 <cit> . srai is primarily implicated in homeostatic functions such as the uptake of modified lipids and proteins, in addition to having a role in pathogen clearance
 <cit> . in contrast, marco has been primarily implicated in host defense via the direct recognition and subsequent endocytosis of pathogens and the modulation of cytokine production
 <cit> . both scara <dig> and scara <dig> have been documented in vitro to bind bacteria
 <cit> , although this ability has not been established in vivo. conversely, scara <dig> has been associated with the protection of cells from reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress
 <cit> . this combination of diverse patterns of expression and function raise questions regarding whether these proteins are related to one another.

the scavenger receptors were originally grouped based on their ability to bind acldl as a ligand, even if this binding ability can have very low affinity
 <cit> . this broad and imprecise definition, which ignores the diversity of their biological functions and expression patterns, raises the question of whether these proteins share any evolutionary relatedness. in this study, we present multiple evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of the ca-srs by mining publicly available genomes for these receptors. we discovered that there is no evidence of ca-srs in non-vertebrate species, suggesting that the domain architecture of this protein family is unique to that of vertebrates. to our knowledge, these are the first examples of thorough evolutionary analyses of this family. our results confirm that an evolutionary relationship exists between all  <dig> members of the ca-srs. we postulate that  <dig> unique gene duplication events, followed by domain fusions, internal repeats, and deletions, shaped the current architecture of this family to include some diversity in structure and function.

RESULTS
the ca-srs share similar domain architectures
sixteen srai,  <dig> marco,  <dig> scara <dig>   <dig> scara <dig>  and  <dig> scara <dig> full-length mrna and protein sequences were identified and analyzed in this study . an exhaustive bioinformatic search was undertaken in order to identify these receptors, including searches of all srcr-containing proteins for transmembrane, α-helical, and collagenous domains using various bioinformatic tools. these extensive methods were used in order to best identify any ancient homologs, pseudogenes, or related proteins that had undergone various domain swap or fusion events. many of the ca-srs examined have not been previously annotated and therefore represent novel ca-sr sequences. previous analyses of the domain structures of the ca-srs have been inconsistent; therefore, we re-examined these predictions using current bioinformatic tools. although the domain architectures were resolved for each scavenger receptor sequence, those from the homo sapiens genome were used as representatives to visualize the relative lengths and composition of these domains in figure
 <dig> and explained in detail in additional file
1: table s <dig>  cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains were established using the tmhmm software
 <cit>  and were determined to be approximately 30- <dig> and  <dig> amino acids long, respectively, in each receptor.

previous work indicated the region between the transmembrane and collagenous domains to be a combination of a spacer and α-coiled-coil region dependent on the receptor in question . our analyses using the jufo server  and psipred
 <cit>  indicated that this region is primarily α-helical in all  <dig> receptors and includes multiple coiled-coil motifs . the coiled-coil motifs are based on heptad motifs of the form hxxhccch
 <cit> , where hydrophobic residues  appear at the first and fourth positions of a seven amino acid sequence, with positions five to seven tending to be charged . variations on this 3- <dig> separation pattern of hydrophobic residues include 4- <dig>  3- <dig>  and 3- <dig> repeats
 <cit> . these motifs have been shown to be necessary for oligomerization in other proteins
 <cit>  and thus are likely to contribute to the trimerization of the ca-srs.

the boundary between this α-helical domain and the collagenous region was determined using the characteristic gly-xxx-yyy repeat , which appears over the full-length of the collagenous domain. the c-terminal domains have been previously annotated in ncbi and were confirmed using ncbi’s cdd. the resulting domain architecture shows strong similarities across the ca-sr protein family.

classification of known and novel ca-srs
bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenies were constructed for each of the  <dig> protein family members using full-length protein sequences of the known and novel ca-srs gathered from available genomes present in the ncbi and ensembl databases. novel ca-srs were identified based on domain structure, synteny analyses, and pairwise sequence identity scores as compared to known ca-srs. phylogenies of these sequences were created to examine and confirm the within group relatedness of these proteins across vertebrate species.

the molecular phylogeny of full-length marco protein sequences  details the conservation of marco across mammalian and avian species. a partial transcript of a marco-like gene covering the srcr and a piece of the collagenous domain was found in the xenopus tropicalis genome, indicating that a functional marco gene might also be present in amphibians . however, the sequence was excluded from further analyses since the full-length protein sequence spans multiple contigs and could not be reliably constructed. similarly, srai is present in mammalian and amphibian genomes , yet there appears to be a secondary loss of srai in avian species since it is absent from the gallus gallus and meleagris gallopavo genomes. scara <dig> appears to be the most abundant of the srcr-containing ca-srs, as the gene is conserved in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish .

both of the non-srcr-containing ca-srs, scara <dig> and scara <dig>  are also present in mammalian, avian, amphibian, reptilian, and fish genomes. of the  <dig> proteins, scara <dig>  was found in ostariophysian and salmonidae fish species, while scara <dig>  is present in these genomes as well as the bony acanthopterygii fishes.

marco, srai, and scara <dig> share a highly conserved srcr domain
three of the ca-srs  possess an evolutionarily conserved srcr domain. the srcr domain is present in many proteins and is highly conserved across various deuterosome species
 <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the srcr domains from these  <dig> ca-srs were conducted in order to determine the evolutionary relations between them. by both bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, the srcr domains of each receptor cluster together, with those domains from srai grouping closer to those of scara <dig> when compared to marco , indicating that the srcr domains of srai and scara <dig> are more similar to each other than to those of marco and are likely to have diverged from a more recent common ancestor.

the non-srcr containing ca-srs - scara <dig> and scara <dig> - are evolutionarily related to each other
of the  <dig> ca-srs two, scara <dig> and scara <dig>  do not possess the conserved srcr domain at their c-terminus. instead, scara <dig> has a c-type lectin domain and scara <dig> terminates after its collagenous region. permutation tests of homo sapiens scara <dig> and scara <dig> confirmed that their full-length amino acid sequences are statistically similar to each other . further phylogenetic analyses of the domains shared between these  <dig> ca-srs determined the clustering of scara <dig> and scara <dig> sequences across vertebrate species .

the percent identity  between each ca-sr was calculated using ebi’s emboss needle global alignment algorithm to quantify the amount of sequence similarity shared amongst these receptors. additionally, permutation tests were measured using the prss algorithm part of the fasta package. the probabilities displayed here  are the probability that these receptors share sequence similarity with each other by chance.

a common ancestry is shared between all  <dig> members of the ca-srs
permutation tests performed using the prss software established that each homo sapiens ca-sr amino acid sequence is statistically similar to each other, establishing a strong evolutionary relationship connecting all members of this family . additional analyses of similarities across the ca-sr homo sapiens amino acid sequences confirmed significant sequence similarity amongst these proteins. analyses identified  <dig> conserved motifs including a cluster of negatively charged amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of the  <dig> ca-srs . furthermore, in addition to the plethora of coiled-coil heptad motifs, a conserved motif in the α-helical domains of each receptor, excluding marco
 <cit> , was established . a previously predicted ligand-binding motif of marco
 <cit>  was not found in the srcr domains of srai and scara <dig> ; however, the lysine-rich region in the collagenous domain of srai hypothesized to be necessary for ligand binding was found in all other ca-srs . these similarities in domain structure and conserved motifs support a common evolutionary relationship between all  <dig> ca-srs.

further support for a common evolutionary origin is seen in shared exon features in ca-sr members . each of the  <dig> ca-sr types contains similar overall architecture and exon order, including  a cytoplasmic region, transmembrane domain, α-helical region, and collagenous region. the single exon containing a portion of the cytoplasmic region plus the transmembrane domain is conserved across all  <dig> ca-sr types. exons corresponding the α-helical and collagenous regions are also present in all types, and have undergone expansion and/or contraction in various family members. notably, the collagenous region of marco has expanded considerably and contains numerous additional exons. the α-helical region has also undergone expansion and contraction, with expansion likely occurring within an existing exon in the scara3/scara <dig> branch and reduction occurring within marco.

the evolutionary history of the ca-srs
in order to specify the exact relationships amongst the members of the ca-sr gene family, a phylogeny was established using the  <dig> domains shared across these receptors . this phylogeny suggested a strong relationship amongst scara <dig> and scara <dig> in addition to between srai and scara <dig>  and that marco amino acid sequences cluster between the non-srcr containing receptors and srai and scara <dig>  pairwise identity scores were calculated between each full-length homo sapiens ca-sr protein sequences  which identify a higher level of similarity between marco and the other srcr-containing receptors when compared to between marco and the non-srcr-containing proteins.

discussion
since their discovery in  <dig>  scavenger receptors have been defined by their ability to ‘scavenge’ modified ldl from their environment for internalization and subsequent degradation
 <cit> . as more proteins were discovered that fit this definition, the srs came to represent a polyphyletic group of receptors with varying domain architectures and protein structures that appear to have arose independently ). this prompted the introduction of subclasses to group structurally similar proteins
 <cit> . however, even within the class a subclass there is considerable variability. functionally, for example, marco can bind acldl
 <cit> , srai can bind both oxldl and acldl
 <cit> , and scara <dig> can bind neither
 <cit> . structurally, the ca-srs differ at their c-terminal region and in the lengths of their other domains . there is very little justification for grouping the ca-srs together based on the original definition of ligand binding unless there is an evolutionary relationship amongst the members.

to investigate the evolutionary connection within the ca-srs, we first needed to definitively characterize the domain architecture of these proteins. domain boundaries had been previously defined for the individual members of the ca-srs, but usually in comparison to srai and were not based on current tools. our findings  suggest that there are  <dig> domains - cytoplasmic, transmembrane, α-helical, and collagenous - shared by all members of the ca-srs. conserved motifs in these domains common across the ca-srs suggest not only a common origin of these proteins, but also that they may share significant functionality with each other . while the lengths and consistency of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains remain mostly fixed, the α-helical and collagenous domains vary in length across the receptors in a manner consistent with the possibility of repeats brought about by recombination or duplication events
 <cit> . in contrast, the fifth terminal domain differs or is absent in the ca-srs. while srai, marco, and scara <dig> share a srcr domain at their terminus, scara <dig> possesses a c-type lectin domain and scara <dig> terminates at its collagenous region. the srcr and c-type lectin domains are both able to recognize pathogens
 <cit> , suggesting that the radiation in this region may be due to a domain swapping event that may have allowed for the diversification of host pathogen recognition
 <cit> .

data mining was used to identify known and novel ca-srs in publicly available databases. conservation of these proteins across vertebrate species was examined via phylogenetics. no ca-srs were identified in available non-vertebrate genomes, implying that although the individual domains that make up these receptors - specifically the srcr and c-type lectin domains - are ancient, the modern ca-sr domain architecture likely arose after the divergence of vertebrates from other species. using these sequences, the relationships between the  <dig> members of the ca-srs were analyzed.

to determine a shared evolutionary ancestry amongst all  <dig> members of the ca-srs, permutation tests were performed using the representative homo sapiens protein sequences, which revealed significant sequence similarity between all of these proteins . additionally, notable motifs shared amongst all or most receptors were identified , lending definitive reason for these proteins to be classified as a protein family.

phylogenetic analyses allowed us to hypothesize regarding the evolutionary history of this protein family. first, analyses presented in figures
 <dig> 
 <dig>  and
 <dig> indicate that srai and scara <dig> are most closely related to each other than to the other ca-srs. this finding is further supported in the fact that the highest amount of sequence similarity is shared between srai and scara <dig> . this is unsurprising given what is known biologically about these  <dig> proteins. although little research has been completed on scara <dig>  it is known that both it and srai bind gram-positive and -negative bacteria
 <cit>  and are both hypothesized to be involved in host defense
 <cit> . second, scara <dig> and scara <dig> were also identified as closely related proteins. not only are their domain lengths similar , but these proteins are also presented as an independent cluster in the phylogenetic analysis of all ca-srs . although they are not well studied, from what we know these  <dig> proteins do not share much functionality. from what little is known regarding scara <dig>  this receptor appears to function in a similar fashion to the srcr-containing ca-srs by binding gram-positive and -negative bacteria and being expressed on cells involved in host defense
 <cit> . in contrast, scara <dig> is expressed on fibroblasts and has been proposed to protect against reactive oxygen species by binding and internalizing oxidative molecules
 <cit> . however, the lengths and general composition of scara <dig> and scara <dig> proteins are very similar as indicated by a shared percent identity of  <dig> % across the full-lengths of their proteins . perhaps the differences in their biological functions are restricted to the presence of a c-terminal c-type lectin domain in scara <dig> and the potentially lost terminal domain in scara <dig> 

lastly, the positioning of marco is intermediate between the srai/scara <dig> and scara3/scara <dig> clusters. the phylogenetic evidence presented in figure
 <dig> suggests that this protein sequence is most similar to scara3/scara <dig> with high posterior probabilities and bootstrap support. however, percent identity measures  as well as functional evidence suggests that it is most similar to the other srcr-containing receptors. for example, research conducted by arredouani et al. demonstrates that both srai and marco are essential for clearance of bacteria and inert particles from the lungs
 <cit> , indicating that even though marco is more evolutionarily related to scara <dig> and scara <dig>  it is more functionally related to the srcr-containing receptors. further analysis of the exon gene structures of the ca-srs or further functional analyses of all  <dig> members may help resolve this inconsistency.

this data supports the hypothesis of a single ancestral ca-sr from which duplication events occurred allowing for the diversification of this group. we propose that  <dig> independent gene duplication events occurred allowing for the presence of  <dig> ca-srs in vertebrate species. this common ancestor likely included most of the common features of the ca-srs including the transmembrane, α-helical, and collagenous domains, and may have also contained the srcr domain shared by  <dig> of the  <dig> ca-srs. this ancestral ca-sr may have duplicated  into  <dig> distinct proteins  which would have contained the domain structure typical of this group . a second duplication event of putative proto-gene  <dig>   would have resulted in the genes that differentiated into srai and scara <dig>  the putative  <dig>  gene would have contained an srcr coding domain, and possibly an extended collagenous region . this srcr encoding region would likely have been lost in the predecessor of scara <dig> and scara <dig> upon a third duplication event, which would have resulted in the ancestral gene encoding marco . the srcr domain may have been replicated by a c-type lectin domain in the predecessor of scara <dig> and scara <dig> and later lost in scara <dig> when a fourth duplication event resulted in the divergence from scara <dig> and scara <dig> , or may have simply replaced the c-type lectin of scara <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
despite the broad, general definition that brought the  <dig> members of the ca-srs into the same subclassification of proteins capable of recognizing modified lipoproteins, we have shown significant evidence here that these  <dig> proteins are indeed a protein family. there is considerable evidence of a common origin for these proteins, which may in turn provide insight when performing functional studies on members of this family.
