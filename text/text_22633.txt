BACKGROUND
plants are constantly subjected to microbial attack, especially phytopathogenic fungi and use various defense strategies to protect themselves against disease. these defenses include the strengthening of the physical cell wall barriers  <cit>  and the production of chemical and proteinaceous antimicrobial compounds  <cit> . over the last  <dig> years it has become evident that small, basic, cysteine-rich peptides also form part of the overall defense of plants against phytopathogens, contributing significantly to the innate immunity of plants  <cit> . it has been suggested that all plants possess such a peptide defense system  <cit> . the peptides range from 2– <dig> kda in size and the best characterized examples are the thionins and defensins  <cit> . when first isolated, defensins were classified as γ-thionins, but were later renamed to plant defensins due to their structural and functional similarities to insect and human defensins  <cit> .

plant defensins are a family of basic, cysteine-rich peptides of between 45– <dig> amino acids in size. structurally they consist of one α-helix and one β-sheet, comprising three antiparallel β-strands, and stabilized by the formation of disulfide bridges between the cysteine residues  <cit> . although plant defensins are structurally conserved, their overall homology at the amino acid level is low. however, most plant defensins contain eight cysteine residues linked by four disulfide bridges, an aromatic residue at position  <dig>  two glycines at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and a glutamate at position  <dig> .

most plant defensins exhibit some antimicrobial activity, inhibiting the growth of fungi, oomycetes and gram positive bacteria in vitro. the exact mechanisms underlying the antifungal activity exerted by plant defensins are not known, but there is evidence that plant defensins bind to a specific receptor in the fungal membrane, being sphingolipids, rather than random binding and integration into the phospholipid bilayer of the fungal membranes  <cit> . other biological activities such as proteinase and α-amylase inhibition  <cit> , metal tolerance  <cit> , as well as the inhibition of protein translation and hiv proliferation have also been reported for some of the isolated plant defensins  <cit> .

the majority of defensins have been isolated from plant seeds  <cit> , but defensins have also been isolated from leaves  <cit> , flowers  <cit> , tubers  <cit> , seedpods  <cit> , as well as from fruits  <cit> . although plant defensins play an important role in the preformed defense, some members of the defensin family are also upregulated upon pathogen attack or by environmental stimuli, while the expression of others are strictly developmentally regulated  <cit> .

here we report the isolation and characterization of the first plant defensin from vitis vinifera. the peptide encoding gene shows a strict tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression pattern. the peptide is strongly antifungal without inducing morphological changes to the hyphae of the tested fungi, but with an indication of a compromising effect on the fungal membrane. the ripening-specific expression pattern in berries and the strong in vitro antifungal characteristics of the isolated peptide draws interest to its possible in vivo role in berry defence systems.

RESULTS
isolation and genomic characterization of vv-amp1
initial screening of the vitis vinifera est database at the institute for genomic research  with the blast algorithm yielded only one est hit, tc <dig>  subsequent analyses of the available databases after the completion of the grapevine genome sequence, has yielded other putative defensin sequences . primer design was based on the est tc <dig> and pcr screening of cdna batches made from grapevine root, leaf and berry material allowed for the isolation of a single complete coding sequence from grape berry cdna. the sequence was termed vitis vinifera antimicrobial peptide  <dig> , because of its homology to the family of plant defensins. the complete coding sequence of vv-amp <dig> is  <dig> bp in size and encodes for a predicted  <dig> amino acid peptide, comprising a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide and a  <dig> amino acid mature peptide . the genomic copy isolated for vv-amp <dig> is  <dig> bp in size and comparative analyses with the cdna sequences revealed that a  <dig> bp intron interrupts the predicted signal peptide .

southern blot analysis conducted on genomic dna from cultivar pinotage revealed the presence of two hybridization signals for vv-amp <dig> within the v. vinifera genome . blast analysis of the grapevine genome sequence at the national centre for biotechnological information  identified two possible contig sequences, vv78x <dig>  and vv78x <dig> . alignment analysis of these two genomic sequences showed that the nucleotide areas upstream and downstream of the vv-amp <dig> open reading were similar, suggesting that a single copy of vv-amp <dig> is present in the v. vinifera genome.

alignment analysis of the genomic sequences of vv-amp <dig> isolated from non-vinifera vitis species revealed a high level of homology  at nucleotide level. when the deduced coding sequences for the different vv-amp <dig> genes were compared, up to 95% homology was observed, translating into 93% identity at the deduced amino acid level . vv-amp <dig> from v. vinifera showed the highest homology to the gene amplified from v. afganista, sharing  <dig> % homology at amino acid level. the deduced amino acid sequences from v. vinifera and v. afganista differed from the rest by having one additional amino acid in their signal peptide region, with the introduction of isoleucine at position  <dig> .

bioinformatical characterization of the deduced amino acid sequence of vv-amp1
blastp results and further alignment analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence of vv-amp <dig> shared high homology to the γ-thionins from castanea sativa and ppt from petunia . vv-amp <dig> also displays the following conserved amino acid residues: an aromatic residue at position  <dig>  two glycine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> and a glutamate at position  <dig>  as well as the eight cysteine residues at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> present in all plant defensins . disulfide bridge analysis done with dipro showed that the eight cysteine residues of vv-amp <dig> are connected by four disulfide bridges .

comparative homology modeling of the deduced amino acid sequence confirmed that the tertiary structure of vv-amp <dig> closely resembled that of hordothionin-γ  from barley and had the typical defensin structure consisting of an α-helix and a triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, which are organized in a βαββ configuration . the structure is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide linkages between the eight cysteine residues.

targeting ability of the putative vv-amp <dig> signal peptide
pa-sub predicted that the signal peptide of vv-amp <dig> directs its product to the apoplastic regions of plant cells. this was confirmed by fusing the vv-amp <dig> signal peptide to gfp under constitutive expression and overexpressing it into tobacco. inverted fluorescent microscopy conducted on free-hand cross sections of the tobacco leaf petiole revealed that the gfp accumulated in the apoplastic regions .

expression profile of vv-amp <dig> within v. vinifera
our investigation of the expression pattern of vv-amp <dig> within grapevine, revealed that this gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, being only expressed in berries . northern blot analysis on berries in different stages of development and ripening confirmed that the gene is developmentally regulated. vv-amp <dig> expression was induced upon berry ripening, starting at véraison,  <dig> weeks post-flowering . expression of vv-amp <dig> remained high throughout the rest of the berry ripening stages. induction studies, conducted on grapevine leaf material, simulating osmotic stress, wounding, pathogen infection with botrytis cinerea as well as treatment with aba, were unable to induce vv-amp <dig> expression . the experiment was also repeated on pre-véraison berries, but none of the induction stimuli could overcome the developmental regulation . on the pre-véraison berries, ja and sa treatments were included without any induction observed .

recombinant production of vv-amp1
recombinant vv-amp <dig>  fused to the gst-tag, was successfully produced in e. coli by using the rosetta gami plyss expression system. purification of the recombinant peptide using a glutathione affinity chromatography system  yielded  <dig> mg/l purified peptide. the recombinant fusion protein had a size of  <dig> kda, consistent with the predicted size. successful removal of the gst-tag was achieved by thrombin cleavage and confirmed with sds-page analyses and western blot analysis . recombinant peptide was successfully separated from the cleaved tag, using ion exchange chromatography, and desalted on a c <dig> column. mass spectrometry revealed that the recombinant peptide had a size of  <dig>  kda, which matched the predicted mass . peptide mass fingerprinting confirmed that recombinant vv-amp <dig> resulted from the dna sequence encoding for the mature vv-amp <dig> peptide.

antimicrobial activity of vv-amp1
recombinant vv-amp <dig> was tested against several plant pathogenic fungi using a dose-response growth inhibition assay. the activity of vv-amp <dig> on fungal hyphae was assessed by incubating fungal spores in the presence of various concentration of vv-amp <dig> over a  <dig> hour period, with the ic <dig> value being determined after  <dig> hours of incubation . vv-amp <dig> had a severe effect on the accumulation of fungal biomass over time in all of the fungal isolates tested and was most active against f. oxysporum  and v. dahliae , the two causal agents of wilting disease, with ic <dig> values of  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively. vv-amp <dig> was however less effective against f. solani with an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  μg/ml . the necrotrophic fungi b. cinerea  was inhibited with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> μg/ml. treatment of b. cinerea spores with peptide concentrations above  <dig> μg/ml resulted in > 95% growth inhibition, while a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml completely arrested spore germination . the peptide showed no inhibition of a. longipes, even at peptide concentrations above  <dig> μg/ml .

microscopical analyses of fungal hyphae treated with vv-amp <dig> showed no signs of the characteristic hyperbranching effect associated with some plant defensins. vv-amp <dig> did, however, severely alter the ability of fungal hyphae to elongate and most hyphal tips had a swollen appearance. granulation of the hyphal cytoplasm was also observed in most fungi treated with vv-amp <dig> .

a propidium iodine treatment combined with fluorescent microscopy showed high levels of fluorescence present in the vv-amp <dig> treated samples when compared to the untreated fungi that showed no fluorescence . this is an indication that the fungal membranes were compromised by the presence of the vv-amp <dig> peptide. fluorescence was observed throughout the affected hyphae in both fusarium strains , whereas fluorescence was only present at the tips of vv-amp <dig> treated hyphae from v. dahliae .

recombinant vv-amp <dig> is heat-stable and sensitive to proteinase activity in preliminary stability assessments
vv-amp <dig> was tested for its stability at different temperatures using an antifungal growth assay against botrytis cinerea . vv-amp <dig> showed remarkable stability at temperatures up to 100°c. ninety five percent of its antifungal activity was retained after  <dig> min of treatment at 80°c and 62% at 100°c for  <dig> min.

vv-amp <dig> was very sensitive to proteinase k treatment, confirming its proteinaceous nature. enzyme treatment at  <dig> μg/ml totally abolished the activity of vv-amp <dig>  as determined by an antifungal assay against v. dahliae .

discussion
the isolation and characterisation of a plant defensin encoding gene from grapevine
plant defensins are small, cysteine-rich peptides with a basic nature that exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and have been implicated in the innate defense system of plants. here we report the isolation and characterization of the first defensin peptide and its encoding gene from vitis vinifera, the world's most important fruit crop. the  <dig> bp open reading frame isolated from v. vinifera berry cdna  encoded vv-amp <dig>  a peptide with significant consensus and structural homology to the peptide family of plant defensins. analysis of the grapevine genome revealed that only one copy of vv-amp <dig> is present in the vitis vinifera genome and the two hybridization signals observed in the southern blot analysis are due to heterogeneity in the vv-amp <dig> locus. moreover, the isolated gene is highly conserved within the vitis genus . most of the non-vinifera vitis spp. that yielded homologous sequences are known for their high levels of natural resistance against fungal pathogens. bioinformatical analyses on these sequences in comparison with the v. vinifera sequence showed high levels of homology and shared deduced structural features. the recently completed grapevine genome sequence revealed additional putative defensin sequences in vitis vinifera  that could be targeted for isolation and characterization as well.

plant defensins exhibit an array of expression profiles and can be expressed constitutively, in a tissue specific pattern and also induced by various environmental stimuli  <cit> . the expression profiling of vv-amp <dig> showed that this gene is highly regulated. vv-amp <dig> showed a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression pattern, being only expressed in grape berry material . under the conditions tested, no additional inducers were observed and none overcame the berry-specific and developmentally regulated expression pattern . the lack of response to wounding and infection by the known grapevine pathogen, b. cinerea, suggests that regulation of vv-amp <dig> expression is independent of the plant defense signalling pathways directed by these external stimuli. hormone treatments in berries included sa, ja and aba, but none of these showed any induction under the conditions tested. the expression pattern of vv-amp <dig> corresponds to berry ripening and it will be important to evaluate the effect of brassinosteroids further since it has recently been shown that these compounds act as inducers of berry ripening  <cit> . aba is similarly linked to berry ripening, but did not have any effect on vv-amp <dig> expression levels. the specific expression pattern of this defensin gene is interesting and opposite to many genes linked to defence in grape berries. transcriptome analysis and other studies have shown that many defence-related genes are down-regulated at the onset of berry ripening. it has been hypothesized that the defence mechanisms of the berry is not maintained during the post-véraison stages since the seed, containing the matured embryo, has obtained its hardened and protective seed coat when the berry starts to ripen. the plant has therefore completed its reproductive cycle and defence in berries are  less important. the signal peptide of vv-amp <dig> was shown to target gfp to the apoplastic regions when overexpressed in transgenic tobacco . tissue-localization in the grape berries will provide further clues to the possible in planta role of this peptide, specifically in relation to berry defence.

vv-amp1: a highly stable and potent inhibitor of a range of fungal pathogens
characteristic features of vv-amp1
comparative analysis of the mature vv-amp <dig> with other members of the defensin family revealed that vv-amp <dig> shared the conserved amino acids present in the majority of plant defensins and was closest related to the defensin ppt from petunia . classification studies, based on the precursor protein structure, grouped vv-amp <dig> with class i of the defensin family  <cit> . class i defensin peptides have a conserved precursor protein structure that consists of a n-terminal signal peptide followed by a mature defensin domain  <cit> .

the vv-amp <dig> gene was successfully overexpressed in e. coli to yield purified peptide which could be subjected to accurate determination of size, as well as peptide fingerprinting. these results, as well as western blot analysis confirmed that the peptide was purified to homogeneity. the purified peptide was shown to be highly heat-stable, but readily deactivated by protease treatment. preliminary results  indicates that vv-amp <dig> is quite sensitive to the divalent cation ca2+ when evaluated against b. cinerea. the sensitivity to cations is a characteristic well documented for many members of the plant defensin family  <cit> , but is highly dependent on the fungal pathogen tested. since the peptide is targeted to the apoplastic area, this indication of ca2+ sensitivity, as well as other cations, will have to be tested further against a broader range of fungi, specifically against the fungal pathogens of grapevine.

inhibition profile and antifungal characteristics of vv-amp1
the panel of pathogens tested included various wilting disease pathogens as well as botrytis, as a grapevine pathogen. many of the grapevine fungal pathogens cannot be cultured in vitro  and could not be included in this evaluation. vv-amp <dig> was especially effective against the causal agents of wilting disease, but also inhibited the necrotrophic botrytis. vv-amp <dig> limited the fungal biomass of the test organisms, but did not induce typical morphological changes  in the treated cultures, classifying vv-amp <dig> as a non-morphogenic antifungal defensin peptide.

the inhibition profile of vv-amp <dig> is interesting and promising, both from the perspectives of general plant biotechnology, as well as understanding and manipulating grapevine defence specifically. the strong activity of vv-amp <dig> towards v. dahliae is of great interest in the engineering of disease resistant crops species. vv-amp <dig> is very active against v. dahliae, with particularly low ic <dig> values. a defensin peptide from medicago sativa, alfafp, has already showed great economical potential  <cit>  by protecting potato against v. dahlia under field trial conditions. the activity of the peptide against grapevine pathogens still needs further evaluation, but preliminary inhibition analysis with a few pathogenic fungi that can be cultured in vitro yielded very promising results. several of the grapevine trunk disease pathogens show strong sensitivity to the peptide in vitro . most of the economically important grapevine fungal pathogens require the plant host for growth and transgenic overexpression studies and whole plant infection assays are needed to determine the effect of the peptide on the these pathogens.

the observed activity of vv-amp <dig> was associated with alteration of fungal membrane permeability as indicated by the propidium iodide uptake assay and fluorescent microscopy . previous studies have shown that plant defensins alter fungal membrane permeability, which is associated with a rapid uptake and efflux of ca2+ and k+  <cit> . it remains to be elucidated whether vv-amp <dig> used the same mechanism for the observed induction of membrane permeabilization.

other questions that remain to be answered are the in planta stability of the peptide when overexpressed and the nature and degree of disease resistance that might be afforded by the peptide. the putative promoter of the vv-amp <dig> gene has also been isolated from grapevine  and might provide valuable insights into the regulation of this defensin.

CONCLUSIONS
vv-amp <dig> encodes for a berry specific, developmentally regulated peptide with homology to the superfamily of plant defensins. mature vv-amp <dig> is directed to the apoplastic regions of the plant cell by a  <dig> amino acid signal peptide. recombinant vv-amp <dig> showed a broad spectrum of antifungal activity at low concentrations against both necrotrophic and wilting disease causing fungi. vv-amp <dig> activity was classified as non-morphogenic and possibly associated with membrane permeabilization. the antifungal activities of the peptide are promising enough to merit further investigation of its potential in biotechnology approaches to increase fungal resistance in important crop species.
