BACKGROUND
it is generally accepted that the activation of naïve t cells requires two signals. one is provided by association of the t-cell receptor with the major histocompatibility complex–peptide complex. the other, known as costimulation, is necessary for optimal t-cell activation, which leads to clonal t-cell expansion, cytokine secretion and development of effector functions. two main costimulatory molecules, b7- <dig> and b7- <dig>  accomplish the coactivation function through binding with their ligand cd <dig> on the surface of t cells  <cit> . lack of costimulation however, results in the induction of t-cell tolerance, named anergy. this is important for tumor immunity because a variety of tumors are potentially immunogenic but do not stimulate an effective anti-tumor immune response in vivo. that is partly because some tumors can deliver antigen-specific signals to t cells, but do not deliver costimulatory signals necessary for full activation of t cells  <cit> .

low levels of b7- <dig> and b7- <dig> have been detected on certain human cancers  <cit>  and in a series of cell lines derived from human carcinomas  <cit> . absence of costimulatory b <dig> molecule expression renders tumors “invisible” to the immune system. accordingly, expression of b <dig> on tumor cells induced tumor rejection in a murine model, suggesting that providing extra costimulation molecules might render tumor cells capable of effective antigen presentation, leading to their eradication in vivo. based on the safety considerations of expressing b <dig> using a virus vector, we propose a novel strategy to present costimulatory molecules by immobilizing recombinant b <dig> on the surface of polyhydroxyalkanoate -based nanoparticles.

phas are a family of biodegradable, non-toxic, biocompatibility polyesters, which are synthesized by a wide range of microorganisms  <cit> , have promise as biomedical materials and have been investigated for many transplant applications  <cit> . moreover, phas could also be used as a nonspecific immobilizing matrix for protein purification and presentation, mediated by several kinds of pha granule associated proteins, which contain a hydrophobic granule-binding domain  <cit> . among these proteins, pha granule binding protein phasin  has a high affinity for hydrophobic materials and has been utilized to develop a low-cost protein production system  <cit> , as well as a fluorescence activated cell sorting-based diagnostic technique  <cit> .

in this study, the extracellular domain of the b7- <dig> molecule was fused with phap at its n-terminal and the recombinant b7-2-phap protein was immobilized on the surface of poly -based nanoparticles. the immunocompetence of the resulting fusion protein and functionality of the phbhhx nanoparticles were analyzed.

RESULTS
microbial production and purification of gst-b7-2-phap fusion proteins by escherichia coli
the phap gene was fused with the coding sequence for the extracellular domain of the b7- <dig> molecule and was expressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> , with a glutathione s-transferase  tag at the n-terminal of the resulting fusion protein. a flexible peptide linker  was inserted between b7- <dig> and phap to ensure correct folding. the gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein was efficiently produced by recombinant e. coli bl <dig>  . however, most of the expressed intracellular fusion protein formed inclusion bodies, probably owing to the hydrophobic nature of phap. in order to increase the soluble proportion of the fusion protein to facilitate purification, 5%  ethanol was added to the broth during cultivation. at the same time, the process of inducing expression was undertaken at a low temperature of 20°c. the soluble crude proteins obtained from lysates of e. coli were collected by sonication and centrifugation. the gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione sepharose 4b  column. sodium dodecyl sulfate  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis showed that soluble gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda was successfully produced in the recombinant e. coli bl <dig>  and a single band of the purified gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein was detected from the eluted sample .

preparation and characterization of nanoparticles
phbhhx nanoparticles were prepared using the emulsification–solvent evaporation technique described previously  <cit> . the average diameter of prepared nanoparticles was 198 ±  <dig> nm with a relative low polydispersity index of  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the size distribution of resulting phbhhx nanoparticles, which formed an incipient stable colloidal suspension in aqueous medium that could be stored for at least  <dig> month without aggregation. the concentration of the phbhhx nanoparticle suspension was adjusted to  <dig> mg ml- <dig> for further application.

characterization of gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein immobilized nanoparticles
to characterize the nanoparticles,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mg ml- <dig> phbhhx nanoparticles were incubated with an equal volume of purified gst-b7-2-phap fusion proteins  for  <dig> h and then collected by centrifugation. after the immobilization process and removal of the nanoparticle proportion, no proteins were detected in the supernatant of samples with the initiation gst-b7-2-phap concentration of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mg ml- <dig>  in the sample to which  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> gst-b7-2-phap protein was added,  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> protein remained in the supernatant after removing the coated nanoparticles. this indicated that approximately  <dig> μg of gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein could be immobilized on the surface of  <dig> mg phbhhx nanoparticles. western blot analysis also demonstrated that gst-b7-2-phap fusion proteins could be detected on the samples eluted from the nanoparticles . a slight amount of protein could still be detected in the supernatant when the initial protein concentration was  <dig>  mg ml- <dig> . however, when the protein concentration of the initial sample was  <dig> mg ml- <dig>  all gst-b7-2-phap fusion proteins could be immobilized on the surface of phbhhx nanoparticles and no protein was detected in the supernatant after incubation with phbhhx nanoparticles . this demonstrated that the highest achievable amount of immobilized gst-b7-2-phap fusion protein on the phbhhx nanoparticles could be as high as  <dig> μg per  <dig> mg nanoparticles.

proliferation of human t cells stimulated with b7-2-phap-phbhhx nanoparticles
human lymphocytes were isolated from peripheral blood donated by a healthy volunteer. the t cell population was expanded by phytohemagglutinin stimulation. the assembled gst-b7-2-phap-phbhhx nanoparticles were digested with thrombin to remove the gst tag. the immunocompetence of b7-2-phap-phbhhx nanoparticles was evaluated by t cell proliferation assay. figure  <dig> shows the relative proliferation of human t cells under different treatments.

following in vitro phytohemagglutinin  stimulation, activated t cells proliferated. t cells treated with anti-cd <dig> antibody  alone received only the primary signal for t cell activation, and thus did not become activated or proliferate. however, addition of either immobilized b7-2-phap  or free b7-2-phap protein led to significant cell expansion. the b7-2-phap loaded phbhhx nanoparticles showed a higher activity for stimulated cell expansion than non-immobilized free b7-2-phap protein. phbhhx nanoparticle treatment also induced the stimulation of cell proliferation. immobilized b7-2-phap on phbhhx nanoparticles together with anti-cd <dig> antibody demonstrated the highest activity for the stimulation of cell proliferation. these results indicated that phbhhx-based b7-2-phap presenting nanoparticles can be used to activate t cells.

discussion
phas are linear biopolyesters produced as energy- and carbon-storage materials by many bacteria. the medical applications of pha have been extensively explored in recent years for implant biomedical applications including sutures, nerve conduits, patches, slings, cardiovascular patches, stents, guided tissue repair/regeneration devices, bone marrow scaffolds and so on. pha nanoparticles have also been developed as controlled drug-release vectors owing to their biocompatibility and biodegradability.

the surface of pha-based nanoparticles can be modified by many different types of signaling molecules and thus can be used for purposes other than targeted delivery. this can also be achieved by engineering proteins other than phap such as other pha surface associated proteins including phac, phar, and phaz. these proteins provide targets for displaying various molecules on polymer nanoparticle surfaces for protein immobilization and display. the phasin phap is a small amphiphilic protein that can associate with most hydrophobic polymer granule surfaces via strong hydrophobic interactions. phap is abundant on the surface of natural pha granules, and can reach approximately 5%  of the total cell protein in pha-accumulating bacteria. thus, multifunctional polymer nanoparticles can be obtained through protein engineering of phap and applied to a variety of versatile situations. the functional fusion proteins were able to produce easily by recombinant bacteria cultivation. this method provides a simple and convenient way to immobilize and present proteins on the surface of hydrophobic biomaterials without complicated procedures to modify both proteins and materials.

human b7- <dig> is a 329-amino-acid  protein containing a putative 23-aa signal peptide, a 224-aa extracellular domain, a 21-aa transmembrane domain, and a 61-aa cytoplasmic domain. the absence of the signal peptide, the transmembrane domain, and the cytoplasmic domain did not affect the costimulatory activity of b <dig> molecules. in this study, the 224-aa extracellular domain was subcloned and fused with phap and immobilized on the surface of phbhhx nanoparticles through the hydrophobic interactions between phap and polymer. as measured by western blot,  <dig> μg of gst-b7-2-phap fusion proteins could be immobilized on the surface of  <dig> mg phbhhx nanoparticles, which by extrapolation implies  <dig> μg  b7-2-phap fusion protein was present on the surface of  <dig> mg of nanoparticles. when  <dig> μg ml- <dig> immobilized b7-2-phap proteins was applied to cultured cells, the amount of nanoparticles used was approximately  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  previously we demonstrated that  <dig> μg ml- <dig> phbhhx nanoparticles could enhance the cell viability of rodent lymphocytes from spleen. interestingly, the main degradation product of the phbhhx polymer, 3-hydroxybutyrate, can promote interleukin- <dig> and interferon-γ secretion by rodent t lymphocytes . this may explain the slight t cell proliferation resulting from the non-coated phbhhx nanoparticle treatment in this study.

phytohemagglutinin is a lectin found in plants, and is used as a mitogen to trigger t lymphocyte cell division. isolated lymphocytes were treated with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> phytohemagglutinin to increase cell numbers prior to the proliferation assay. thus, the expanded cells were mainly t cells, although small numbers of b cells and other monocytes remained in the culture. this may explain why non-immobilized b7-2-phap fusion proteins also resulted in cell proliferation. phap is a bacterial protein that might be recognized by b cells, thus triggering an immune response resulting in lymphocyte proliferation. however, whether the b7-2-phap fusion protein was immobilized or not, the combined treatment of b7-2-phap protein and anti-cd <dig> antibody achieved the highest proliferation ratio and number of activated t cells. compared with the non-immobilized free b7-2-phap protein, the b7-2-phap protein loaded nanoparticles showed a higher activity for cell proliferation stimulation. this can be explained by the advantage of the immobilization system, which can be used to provide several signal molecules that interact concurrently with ligands on cell surfaces.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a novel pha nanoparticle-based b <dig> costimulation molecule-presenting system was developed. both the vehicle and the presented functional protein were produced by microorganism fermentation and purified from the culture broth. the extracellular domain of the b7- <dig> molecule was fused with phap, and the b7-2-phap protein was hetero-expressed by recombinant e. coli bl <dig> . the purified b7-2-phap protein was immobilized on the surface of phbhhx nanoparticles through the hydrophobic interaction between phap and polymer. the immunocompetence study showed that the pha-based b <dig> presenting nanosystem could provide costimulatory signals for t cell activation, leading to t cell expansion in vitro. the b7-2-phap immobilized pha nanosystem provides a novel strategy for the presentation of costimulatory molecules and may be a useful tool for costimulation molecule complementary therapy.
