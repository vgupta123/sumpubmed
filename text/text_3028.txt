BACKGROUND
with 70 % of the earth’s surface covered by oceans and 90 % of their water having temperatures of maximum 5 °c  <cit> , the oceans represent a major resource for new bio-discoveries of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant species. increasing efforts in recent years have aimed at describing microbial biodiversity in a variety of marine cold-temperature environments, including large-scale approaches. these studies led to unprecedented insight into the biodiversity of these environments, largely promoted by the significant technological developments in standardized sampling and next-generation sequencing of metagenome and metatranscriptome  <cit> . psychrophilic microorganisms living at cold temperatures must cope with reduced rates of biochemical and physical processes in response to the low molecular kinetic energy of their environment. however, these organisms, through evolutionary processes, developed metabolic capabilities that enable them to survive and multiply at low temperatures  <cit> . cold-active biocatalysts from psychrophilic microbial strains are attractive with respect to applications that profit from low-temperature reaction conditions, for example due to thermal instability of products and reactants, like in the food processing industry, or the need to efficiently inactivate the biocatalysts during downstream processes, as exemplified by enzymes for bio-chemical synthesis or molecular research . advantages of such enzymes are their often high rates of catalytic activity at low temperature, low temperature optima and less resistance to thermal inactivation as compared to their mesophilic counterparts. psychrophilic microbial strains with suitable biochemical capabilities may also be used in bio-remediation of cold-temperature environments polluted with recalcitrant chemicals, like aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons from crude oil  <cit> .

laccases  are copper-containing oxidases that catalyze the monoelectronic oxidation of various aromatic substances at the expense of molecular oxygen, producing water as the sole by-product  <cit> . belonging to the blue-copper family of oxidases, they have their main role in nature both in construction and de-construction of complex aromatic polymers, in particular lignin, and thus many different laccases have so far been described from plants, insects, fungi and bacteria  <cit> . in combination with electron transfer mediators, forming laccase-mediator systems , their oxidation capability can be even expanded beyond their natural phenolic substrates  <cit> . due to considerable improvements in enzyme production and purification methods, today both laccases and lms represent ideal biocatalysts for a plethora of biotechnological oxidation processes. at present, laccases or lms are used as industrial enzymes in diverse applications: for delignification of lignocellulosic fibers and bleaching in pulp and paper industry  <cit> ; and in the de-colorization of dyes in the textile and printing industries  <cit> . they have also the potential to gain a broader role in chemical synthesis  <cit> , as well as in bio-remediation of industrial waste waters and soils contaminated with e.g., dyes  <cit> , polyaromatic hydrocarbons  <cit> , or extra heavy crude oil  <cit> . laccase functionality based on the conversion of classical laccase substrates such as  <dig> '-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid ,  <dig> -dimethoxyphenol  and guaiacol has lately been shown to be exhibited by other proteins and enzymes not specifically assigned as laccases based on enzyme commission  nomenclature, including copper resistance protein  <cit>  and endospore coat protein  <cit> . as for the laccases themselves, the spectrum of substrates these enzymes convert varies  <cit> , hence rendering the assignment of an enzyme as a laccase rather subjective.

fungal laccases have been extensively studied . despite generally high level of enzymatic activity shown by fungal laccases they do not possess desired features exhibited by their bacterial counterparts such as higher stability over wide ranges of ph and temperature  <cit> . therefore, there is a growing interest in the search of new bacterial laccases. bacterial laccases are produced by phylogenetically diverse bacteria with various biological functions . however, despite the recent advances in the discovery and characterization of laccases and laccase like proteins from bacterial sources , our knowledge is still limited regarding cold active bacterial laccases, while the importance of cold active enzymes both in academy and industry is well documented  <cit> .

in this study, we describe the discovery and genome sequencing of four new psychrobacter strains originating from the barents sea that exhibit laccase activity and heterologous expression of two of these enzymes in escherichia coli bl <dig> . these strains and/or their aromatic compounds oxidizing enzymes may have broad application potentials as cold-active biocatalysts.

RESULTS
building and characterizing a culture collection of bacterial isolates from an arctic marine environment
in collaboration with uit, the arctic university of norway, tromsø, norway, biota, water and sediments were sampled between may 14th and 26th,  <dig>  on a research cruise of r/v jan mayen in north of norway within the arctic circle. sampling was done in ten different locations, spanning a region between and around the svalbard archipelago and the bear island in the barents sea. the collection led to the establishment of a library of  <dig> single bacterial isolates originating from biota , sediments , and water  samples. the strain library consists of, at least,  <dig> genera based on 16s rrna gene sequences of  <dig> isolates, including algibacter, aliivibrio, alteromonas, bacillus, bizionia, cellulophaga, cobetia, colwellia, cytophaga, flavobacterium, halomonas, lacinutrix, leeuwenhoekiella, marinobacterium, marinomonas, moritella, neptunomonas, olleya, photobacterium, planococcus, polaribacter, pseudoalteromonas, pseudomonas, psychrobacter, psychromonas, psychroserpens, shewanella, sulfitobacter, tenacibaculum, thalassomonas, and vibrio species.

screening and identification of strains showing laccase activity
the entire strain collection of  <dig> individual bacterial isolates, arrayed in 96-well plates, was screened for isolates exhibiting extracellular laccase activity, and  <dig> of them scored positive based on the formation of brown zones around the colonies after  <dig> and 48 h of incubation at room temperature . the color formation was observed after 24 h . however, the incubation time was prolonged to 48 h to capture the isolates that were slower in color formation due to either slower growth or reaction rates. positive producers were re-streaked on modified marine agar plates from glycerol stocks and five well separated single colonies from each potential producer were picked and grown on screening plates . one colony from each producing isolate, confirmed for the laccase-positive phenotype, was chosen for further study.fig.  <dig>

all  <dig> laccase-positive strains were identified as members of the genus psychrobacter based on the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the aligned 16s rrna gene sequences were used to generate a phylogenetic tree by the weighbor weighted neighbor joining method . the four distantly related strains p11f <dig>  p2g <dig>  p11g <dig> and p11g <dig> were selected for genome sequencing.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of laccase-positive psychrobacter species based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. psychrobacter strains with laccase-positive phenotype are indicated in bold font. psychrobacter type strains were used as references, with moraxella atlantae as an outgroup. the four strains selected for genome sequence determination are indicated with arrows



genome features, annotation and comparative genomics
manual in silico assembly of the initial newbler assemblies resulted in one scaffold per replicon for all four genomes; p11g <dig> and p2g <dig> genomes completed, and two gaps in p11f <dig> and p11g <dig> chromosomes. the genomes of all four strains are almost identical in size and share a similar g + c content , however display no significant average nucleotide identity   <cit> , except for strains p2g <dig> and p11g <dig> which likely belong to the same novel species . for the strain p11f <dig>  high ani values to psychrobacter sp. jcm  <dig>  and psychrobacter sp. jcm  <dig>  were found, while strain p11g <dig> shows significant similarity to psychrobacter sp. jcm  <dig>  and psychrobacter sp. jcm  <dig> . this fits well with p11f <dig> and p11g <dig> strains described as closely related to p. cibarius  and p. nivimaris   <cit> , respectively, thus validating the results for the 16s rrna gene based classification.table  <dig> genome features of the four psychrobacter strains and other publicly available psychrobacter genomes




























acds: coding dna sequence; bhtg: horizontally transferred gene



an interesting feature of the four genomes is the localization of the rrna gene operons: all of the strains have two operons that are surrounded by cds, while the remaining two, three and four operons  are clustered together. in all cases, two trnas are located between the 16s and 23s rrna encoding genes.

another point of variability among the four isolates is the number and the size of the plasmids they harbor: strain p11f <dig> contains one large plasmid ; p2g <dig> contains three plasmids ; p11g <dig> has four small plasmids ; and p11g <dig> harbors seven plasmids .

the genome features were also compared to the other  <dig> psychrobacter genomes that were publicly available as of december  <dig> , and shown to be similar to the other previously reported sequences except high number of plasmids in p11g <dig> 

pairwise genome alignments were performed for the four studied strains . in agreement with ani values for p2g <dig> and p11g <dig> , dot plot analysis for the two chromosomal dna sequences  confirm that they likely belong to the same species as they show very limited level of discontinuity in the main diagonal which could be explained by very few independent evolutionary events introducing insertions/deletions . also strains p11f <dig> and p11g <dig> show high level of similarity . in addition to indels observed throughout the sequences of the two strains, inverted sequence repeats were observed at the middle of the main diagonal which could be an indication of transposable elements. in other cases, significant variation was observed including indels, as well as transposable elements at the middle of the sequences, while the main diagonal remained relatively more consistent at both ends .

in order to compare the metabolic profiles of the genomes, principal component analysis  and hierarchical clustering were performed based on kegg pathways. according to hierarchical clustering, p11f <dig> and p11g <dig> were not clustered with any other species, while p11g <dig> and p2g <dig> were clustered together . in pca, however, p2g <dig> appeard as an outlier and clearly distinguished from p11g <dig> . in order to get an insight as to which metabolic pathway distinguishes the studied genomes, not only from each other but also from the other previously reported psychrobacter genomes, all genes were assigned to kegg orthology  numbers and subsequently used to generate a heat map . it should be noted that 36–50 % of the genes could not be connected to any ko. interestingly, psychrobacter sp. p11f <dig>  p2g <dig> and p11g <dig> were the only strains possessing phenol hydroxylases  that catalyzes the first step of phenol degradation pathway  <cit> . psychrobacter sp. p11f <dig> and p2g <dig> were the only strains possessing maleate isomerase gene  which have been found in nicotine degrading bacteria catalyzing the conversion of maleate to fumarate which can subsequently be used to produce aspartic acid  <cit> . 4-hydroxy 2-oxovalerate aldolase , acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , and 3-phenylpropionate/trans-cinnamate dioxygenase ferredoxin reductase subunit  were detected only in psychrobacter sp. p11f <dig>  these enzymes are known to participate in the metabolism of aromatic amino acid phenylalanine along with other environmental pollutants with similar chemical structure such as styrene and ethylbenzene  <cit> . psychrobacter sp. p2g <dig> and p11g <dig> were the only strains possessing ethanolamine ammonia-lyase small subunit  and large subunit  which is an enzyme commonly found in entrobacteriaceae family giving them the ability to utilize ethanolamine present in mammalian gastrointestinal tract as a source of carbone and nitrogen  <cit> . basic amino acid/polyamine antiporter-apa family  was only found in psychrobacter sp. p11f <dig> which is an electron proton pump involved in extreme acidic resistance  <cit> . there were also certain genes that were found to be present in the four strains and only in a few of other previously reported genomes. for example, psychrobacter sp. p2g <dig> and p11g <dig>  together with psychrobacter sp. ukmcc_swtgb <dig> were the only strains with polysaccharide transporter  which potentially enables them to resist and survive in external environmental stress and host interaction settings  <cit> . chemotaxis protein methyltransferase gene-cher  was detected in psychrobacter sp. p2g <dig>  psychrobacter sp. p11g <dig>  p. pacificensis dsm  <dig> and p. cryohalolentis k <dig>  interestingly, even though chey and chex were present in  <dig> of the analyzed strains, other chemotaxis and flagella-assembly associated genes were absent in all of the strains.fig.  <dig> hierarchical genome clustering of psychrobacter species based on kegg pathways. the four genome sequenced psychrobacter species in this study are indicated in bold font and with arrows

laccase-like gene candidates and sequence analysis
in total six laccase like multicopper oxidase  genes were identified by genome mining  possibly involved in the observed phenotype of laccase activity. these genes were annotated as copper-resistance protein . the lmco gene is located on a plasmid in the strain p11f <dig>  while it is located on the chromosome of the other three strains. the two genes detected in p11g <dig> share 95 % similarity and located  <dig> ,347 bp apart from each other and oriented in opposite directions . similarly, the lmco genes from p11g <dig> share 94 % similarity and are located  <dig> ,160 bp apart and also in opposite direction. in all six cases, the lmco genes are followed by copb encoding a putative copper-resistance protein.fig.  <dig> gene organizations of gene candidates and their positions. 1: lmco; 2: copb; 3: atp-binding protein; 4: cytochrome c; 5: amino acid permease; 6: isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase; 7: copper-transporting p-type atpase; 8: oxidoreductase; grey arrows represents hypothetical proteins

discussion
psychrophilic microorganisms are found in all three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya  <cit> . however, in deep sea and cold temperature marine environments bacteria, and in particular gamma-proteobacteria, are dominant. many novel cultivable species of the genera colwellia, moritella, photobacterium, psychromonas, marinomonas and shewanella have been first described from cold environments  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that the screening of the arctic marine bacterial collection led to identification of strains belonging to the gamma-proteobacteria exhibiting laccase activity.

comparative genomics were performed on kegg-based metabolic profile of the studied four strains against the other publicly available psychrobacter genomes. this analysis revealed noteworthy differences as well as novel genes not being present in the previously reported psychrobacter genomes. for instance, genes associated with metabolic pathways of phenol , nicotine , phenylalanine/styrene/ethylbenzene , ethanolamine  degradation are detected only in the psychrobacter species that are reported in this study. in addition, p11f <dig> is the only strain with basic amino acid/polyamine antiporter gene responsible for extreme acidic resistance. although not unique to our strains, several other features relevant to survival in extreme conditions are also detected such as resistance to heavy metals, regulation of osmotic pressure and the ability to utilize different carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources. all of these features potentially enable the species to survive in harsh conditions. noteworthy, neither flagella assembly genes nor complete set of genes encoding chemotaxis components could be found based on ko analysis, in agreement that members of the psychrobacter genus are generally known to be non-motile  <cit> .

the discovery of the first bacterial laccase  <cit>  motivated many researchers to explore the bacterial domain for laccases. it is now well established that those from bacterial sources exhibit higher thermal- and ph stability compared to their fungal counterparts  <cit> . in this study, we sought to find lmcos from marine cold adapted bacteria. there are a limited number of reports on laccase activity from bacteria living in cold environments, while the importance of cold-active enzymes is well known  <cit> . recent reports support the extracellular laccase like activity from psychrobacter genus  <cit> , as well as psychrophilic/psychrotolerant bacterial species  <cit> .

the bacterial collection used in this study was screened for extracellular laccase activity without supplementing the screening medium with additional copper. this suggests that the identified isolates produce enzyme with laccase-like activity, most likely, extracellularly, if not taking up the substrate and pumping out the chromogenic product back to the extracellular medium. we tested enzymatic activity of cell free supernatant from cultures grown in the absence of substrate which led to no measurable laccase activity . this observation may suggest that the production of lmcos by the studied isolates is inducible. the enzymes did not rely solely on copper for the activity as there were other metal ions such as mg2+ and ca2+ present in the medium that could possibly serve as cofactors for laccases  <cit> . however, we observed more intense brown zone formations in the presence of  <dig>  mm cucl <dig> .

the laccase-positive isolates were all identified as members of the genus psychrobacter, while members belonging to known laccase-active genera such as shewanella and pseudomonas  <cit>  were also present in our collection. this may be explained by our screening system being designed to target only species producing lmcos extracellularly and only those able to oxidize guaiacol as substrate. bacterial lmcos from gramella forsetii kt <dig>  marivirga tractuosa dsm <dig> were shown to not accept guaiacol although they oxidize abts and syringaldazine  <cit> .

similar to the present study, the majority of known bacterial genes encoding proteins with laccase-like activity have been annotated as multicopper oxidase  or copper-resistance proteins   <cit> . the amino acid sequence analysis of the studied lmcos revealed the presence of conserved t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> copper binding sites of 3-domain laccases. the t <dig> site is typically composed of two histidines, one cysteine and one position which is usually variable  <cit> . the variable residue in the studied sequences was methionine which is in agreement with known bacterial lmcos  <cit> . this position is replaced by leucine or phenylalanine in fungal laccases and has been argued to influence the oxidation potential  <cit> . therefore, the studied lmcos are likely among the low redox potential laccases with redox potential below 500 mv  <cit> . notably, however, a bacterial laccase with redox potential as high as 638 mv was recently reported  <cit>  which falls into the middle range of redox potentials   <cit> . although the redox potential of the t <dig> cu site  is the key parameter in the oxidation capacity of laccases, changes in amino acid residues constituting the substrate binding pocket can considerably change the kcat and km values of laccases while maintaining the same redox potential of t <dig> cu site  <cit> . in spite of sharing high level of similarity at the amino acid sequence level, the studied lmcos showed considerable differences in the amino acid residues forming their predicted substrate binding pocket . this suggests that the studied enzymes may exhibit different substrate preferences.

detection of single and multiple laccase genes, both on plasmid and chromosomes, in this study is in agreement with the earlier report by ausec and coworkers  <cit>  in which the authors showed that some members of certain bacterial genera  possess multiple laccase genes in their genome and that the genes can be present both on a plasmid or a chromosome. the presence of multiple laccase genes may confer adaptive benefits with respect to certain life styles and environmental factors  <cit> . prediction of signal peptides encoded by the studied gene candidates supports the extracellular laccase activity observed during high-throughput screening . the majority of putative laccase genes found from publicly available finished/draft genomes and metagenomic datasets encode signal peptide sequences suggesting that the gene products are exported from the cytoplasm  <cit> .

heterologous expression of p11f6-lmco and p11g5-lmco <dig>  in e.coli¸ confirmed the in silico based selection of the target enzymes showing laccase activity towards the phenolic substrate guaiacol, which was used during the initial hts, as well as the bulky non-phenolic substrate abts. however, lmco gene knock-out studies in the native strains are needed to confirm whether the identified candidate genes actually are responsible for the observed phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
the screening of a bacterial collection from marine arctic environments was performed that led to identification of  <dig> psychrobacter strains exhibiting extracellular laccase activity. four of these strains were genome sequenced. based on genome scale metabolic profile analysis, genes associated with degradation of phenolic compounds, nicotine, phenylalanine, styrene, ethylbenzene, and ethanolamine were detected only in the psychrobacter strains reported in this study while they were absent in the other publicly available psychrobacter genomes. in addition, six lmco gene candidates were identified by genome mining, and were located both in plasmid and chromosomal dna. conserved domains for copper binding sites for three-domain laccases were also detected in all six sequences. the activity of heterologously expressed p11f6-lmco and p11g5-lmco <dig> were validated using both abts and guaiacol as substrate. further studies are underway to evaluate the role of the identified lmcos in the four laccase-positive psychrobacter strains, as well as their full biochemical characterization with respect to their potential in various biotechnological applications.
