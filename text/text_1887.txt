BACKGROUND
tooth development is characterized by a sequential and reciprocal series of inductive signals transmitted between the epithelium and mesenchyme  <cit> . a number of transcription factors, signaling molecules, growth factor receptors, and extracellular matrix molecules have been identified as participating in the regulation of odontogenesis patterning and differentiation processes  <cit> . currently, almost all of our understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling tooth formation and mineralization has come from studies in mice , whose teeth are significantly different from those of humans in regards to both morphology and number, with only one set of dentition and an absence of canines and premolars  <cit> . recently, our group used miniature pigs, which resemble humans in anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and development, as an animal model to study the complicated mechanism of tooth development. we identified the characteristic patterns of the spatiotemporal morphogenesis of successional teeth in miniature pigs  <cit>  and mapped the mrna and microrna expression profiles  <cit> . our results identified differential gene expression patterns in different developmental stages and a spatio-temporal pattern of down-regulation during tooth development  <cit> , suggesting that tooth formation is the result of tight control by a sequence of molecular networks that act at particular places and times. despite numerous studies leading to the discovery of genetic mechanisms underlying the expression of specific genes during different stages of tooth development  <cit> , recent studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms also participate in tooth development .

dna methylation is one of the best-studied epigenetic modifications and regulates a variety of processes, including embryonic development, cellular differentiation, tissue-specific gene expression, genomic imprinting, x chromosome in activation, and chromosome stability . in vertebrates, dna methylation occurs predominantly at cytosine residues within cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . cpg-rich regions are referred to as cpg islands , and are located in nearly 40 % of the promoters of mammalian genes  <cit> . cgis usually have global unmethylated patterns  <cit> . unmethylated cgis in the promoter regions are normally associated with gene expression, whereas methylated cgis usually result in gene silencing  <cit> . although dna methylation has been widely accepted as a key mechanism of transcriptional regulation and a critical factor in the development of various organs , little is known about the normal developmental changes in dna methylation during odontogenesis.

in the present study, we characterized the genome-wide temporal dynamics of dna methylation in developing deciduous molars in miniature pigs using methylated dna immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing  to further investigate the role of dna methylation in gene expression during tooth development. we revealed the landscape of the methylome and identified the potential role of dna methylation in gene expression in developing tooth germ. the results support utilizing the pig as a model organism for tooth development research.

RESULTS
global mapping of dna methylation in the tooth germ of miniature pigs
we mapped the global dna methylation status of tooth germ collected from e <dig> and e <dig> miniature pig embryos. after the removal of low-quality reads from raw medip-seq data, an average of  <dig>  gb of clean reads were obtained per sample. total reads were mapped to the reference genome, and mapping rates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, of which  <dig> – <dig>  % were uniquely mapped to specific regions in the pig genome . only uniquely mapped reads were used in further analysis.

uniquely mapped reads were detected in all chromosomes  . the genome coverage of the cg, chg, and chh sites negatively correlated with read depth; most regions had low sequencing depth, and a small number of regions had highs equencing depth . the distribution of reads indifferent cg density regions was also analyzed, demonstrating that low cg density regions covered more uniquely mapped reads than any other region .

different genomic regions exhibited different methylation patterns. the majority of reads were present in the intron regions, followed by cgis . within the gene body, a depletion of or decrease in reads occurred at the transcription start site  in both e <dig> and e <dig> tooth germ. in contrast, a gradual increase in reads occurred in the intragenic region .fig.  <dig> distribution of unique mapped reads in different genomic regions. a the majority of reads were present in the intron regions. the x-axis shows the different gene regions. the y-axis is the percentage of unique mapped reads. b the gene was divided into three regions: a 2 kb region upstream of the transcription start site , the gene body from the tss to the transcription termination site , and a 2 kb region downstream of the tts. the dna methylation level was lowest around the tss



methylation peaks, referred to as methyl-cytosine-enriched regions, are important parameters for the identification of global dna methylation status  <cit> . using macs <dig> . <dig> , we obtained  <dig> – <dig>  peaks, covering  <dig> – <dig>  % of the reference genome . we further analyzed the distribution of peaks in different components of the genome. a major portion of the peaks were present in the cds region, followed by 2 kb downstream of the transcription termination site and 2 kb upstream of the tss, whereas the 5’-utr, intron, and 3’-utrhad fewer peaks . here, 2 kb upstream of tss was considered the proximal promoter.fig.  <dig> distribution of dna methylation peaks in different genomic regions. peaks were defined as regions with sequencing tags more than  <dig> and p value < 10− <dig> with macs. a major portion of peaks were present in the cds region, followed by 2 kb downstream from the transcription termination site and <dig> kb upstream from the tss, whereas the5’-utr, intron, and 3’-utrhad fewer peaks. the x-axis shows the different genomic regions. the y-axis is the number of peaks



medip-seq data validation by bisulfite sequencing
to validate the medip-seq data, three regions with relatively high methylation were selected at random for bisulfite sequencing. the results obtained for the three gene regions were in accordance with the medip-seq results. moreover, great consistency was found among individuals in the same group .fig.  <dig> validation of medip-seq data by bisulfite sequencing . a highly methylated region obtained from medip-seq data was randomly selected to verify its methylation pattern by bsp. each line represents a single strand of dna. each circle represents a single cpg dinucleotide. methylated cpgs are indicated by filled circles, whereas unmethylated cpgs are indicated by open circles



differential dna methylation in e <dig> and e <dig> tooth germ
a comparison of differentially methylated regions  between e <dig> and e <dig> tooth germ revealed  <dig>  dmrs . genes with methylation peaks in both the promoter and gene body regions were considered to be methylated genes  <cit> . next, we identified genes containing dmrs in the two groups. a total of  <dig> differentially methylated genes were identified:  <dig> differentially methylated in the 2 kb upstream ,  <dig> in the 5’utr ,  <dig> in the cds ,  <dig> in the intron ,  <dig> in the3’utr , and  <dig> 2 kb downstream . more genes were up-methylated  than down-methylated  in e <dig> tooth germ compared to e <dig> tooth germ .fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially methylated genes in different genomic regions. a comparison of differentially methylated genes on e <dig> versus e <dig> shows more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes. the number of differentially methylated genes is given at the top of each column



analysis of functional categories of differentially methylated genes
to identify the biological functions associated with differentially methylated genes at e <dig> versus e <dig>  we performed gene ontology  analysis using the david program. go assignments revealed that the up-methylated genes were mainly involved in  <dig> categories . the top  <dig> go categories was showed in fig. 5a including signal transduction, proteolysis, extracellular matrix organization, small molecule metabolic processes, cell-matrix adhesion, axon guidance, and intracellular signal transduction . the down-methylated genes strongly correlated with  <dig> categories . the top  <dig> included transcription , negative regulation of apoptosis, regulation of transcription , signal transduction, positive regulation of transcription , transport, and negative regulation of chromatin silencing at rdna .fig.  <dig> gene ontology and pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes. a top  <dig> significant go groups involving up-regulated differentially methylated genes . b top  <dig> significant go groups involving down-regulated differentially methylated genes . c top  <dig> significant pathways involving up-regulated differentially methylated genes . d top  <dig> significant pathways involving down-regulated differentially methylated genes 



pathway and path-net analysis of differentially methylated genes
to determine the significant pathways involved in differential methylation, we used the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway database to predict putative functions. the up-methylated genes were significantly enriched in  <dig> predicted pathways , the most significant of which was regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, inositol phosphate metabolism, proteoglycans in cancer, phosphatidylinositol signaling, and focal adhesion . the down-methylated genes were tightly related to  <dig> pathways, including gastric acid secretion, endocytosis, the wnt signaling pathway, and cell cycle .

to further understand the interactions among the significant pathways involving the up- and down-regulation of differentially methylated genes, an interaction net was built using path-net analysis. as shown in fig. 6a, some differentially methylated genes were identified as being involved in key pathways during tooth morphogenesis, including the calcium signaling pathway, apoptosis, focal adhesion, pathways in cancer, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and erbb signaling.fig.  <dig> path-net and gene-gene interaction analysis of differentially methylated genes. a path-net analysis of differentially methylated genes. cycle nodes represent pathways, the size of the node represents the power of the interrelation among the pathways, and the lines represent the interaction between the pathways. the more edges in a pathway, the more pathways connecting to it and the more central role it plays within the network. b gene-gene interaction analysis of differentially methylated genes. red circle nodes represent up-regulated genes, and blue circle nodes represent down-regulated genes. the size of the node represents degree, and lines represent interactions between the genes. a straight line represents combinations anda dotted line represents indirect effects. a, activation; b, binding; c, compound; inh, inhibition; u, ubiquination; s, state change; dep, dephosphorylation



signal-net analysis
gene signal transduction networks  were built to explore inter-gene signaling between the differentially methylated genes. a total of  <dig> genes were screened as potential core regulators of tooth development from e <dig> to e <dig> . as shown in fig. 6b, plcg <dig>  pla2g4a, pld <dig>  pik3cb, pik3cd, jak <dig>  ppap2c, mapk <dig> had higher betweenness centrality, degree, indegree, and outdegree, indicating that they may play crucial roles in odontogenesis. gsk3β, erbb <dig>  and igf1r, which are involved in the wnt signaling pathway, erbb signaling, and insulin-like growth factor  signaling, respectively, were also identified as core regulators that interact with other molecules in the signaling network.

discussion
this study provides a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide dna methylation profiles in the developing tooth germ of miniature pigs. the results revealed analogous dna methylation patterns to those of other species, from mammals to plants . in the tooth germ of miniature pigs, the cgis and promoters  remain hypomethylated, whereas the methylation levels in gene body regions were relatively high. in mammals, most cpg sites are methylated, and highly methylated sequences are usually found in the gene body, repeats, satellites, and non-repetitive intergenic regions  <cit> . however, cgis in approximately 60 % of the promoters of human genes and tsss are normally hypomethylated  <cit> . in general, the dna methylation levels of cgis and tsss are associated with gene expression  <cit> . unmethylated cgis in the promoters are essential for tissue-specific expression of corresponding genes in early embryos and later somatic cells  <cit> . the methylation patterns revealed in this study were consistent with those reported in previous studies.

the comparison of dna methylation profiles between e <dig> and e <dig> tooth germ showed the different dna methylation patterns in the different developmental stages of pig tooth germ. pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes indicated that many tooth morphogenesis-related pathways were involved. as expected, several significant pathways were obtained, including those involved in the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, wnt signaling, and calcium signaling. among these pathways, the wnt pathway is one of the most important during tooth morphogenesis. from e <dig> to e <dig>  pig tooth germ progressed from the bell stage to secretory stage. at the bell stage, the enamel- and dentine-forming cells differentiate. initially, the mesenchymal cells differentiate into odontoblasts that secrete the dentine matrix. subsequently, the adjacent epithelial cells differentiate into ameloblasts and secrete enamel matrix. the odontoblasts and ameloblasts then control the phases of mineralization of enamel and dentine. at the secretory stage, tooth development is characterized by the transformation of soft gel-like extracellular matrices into mineralized structures of the skeleton  <cit> . the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and calcium signaling pathway play key roles in cytoskeletal organization  <cit> ; the pathway analysis implied that they likely contribute to tooth biomineralization. the pathway profiles involving differentially methylated genes provided insight into understanding the maturation mechanisms of tooth germ in miniature pigs.

signal-net analysis screened several key genes that may contribute to the transformation of soft tissue into hard tissue, including plcg <dig>  pik3cb, pik3cd, gsk3β, mapk <dig>  erbb <dig>  and igf1r. the phospholipase c gamma- <dig>  gene is important for intracellular signal transduction pathways because it encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the generation of second messengers following the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol  <dig>  5-bisphosphate  <cit> . gsk3β, a negative regulator of the wnt canonical pathway, plays a crucial role in tooth morphogenesis, and inhibition of gsk3β could delay the differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts  <cit> . pik3cb and pik3cd belong to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase  family. pi3k and mapk family members are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, such as proliferation, migration, survival, and apoptosis, as well as tooth development . erbb <dig> and igfir were also identified to be associated with odontogenesis and ameloblast differentiation . the results indicate novel epigenetic mechanisms regulating tooth mineralization.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provided a comprehensive analysis of dna methylation profiles in developing tooth germ from miniature pigs during biomineralization and identified  <dig> differentially methylated genes that may be potential core regulators of tooth development from e <dig> to e <dig>  the genes and pathways screened suggest strong candidates for in-depth studies of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tooth development in miniature pigs.
