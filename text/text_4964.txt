BACKGROUND
several years ago gene expression profiling has emerged as a tool of choice to study developmental kinetics  <cit>  and is now widely used to study mammalian oocytes or embryos  including questions on cell lineage differences  <cit> . however intermingled cells within complex tissues, biopsies, early embryos or single cells give rise to ng or pg amounts of rna so that amplification has become a prerequisite, coupled sometimes to laser capture micro-dissection .

two amplification methods have been reported in the 90ties  <cit> , a linear procedure based on the use of in vitro transcription  and an exponential procedure based on the use of the polymerase chain reaction . these exponential and linear definitions have been based on the dynamics of the corresponding enzymatic reactions with no implicit reference to their intrinsic pitfalls. however, it has quickly become "obvious" that the linear process was a high-fidelity process which guaranteed the conservation of the initial transcript abundances  <cit> . it thus became the tool of choice for gene profiling studies on cdna and oligo-nucleotide arrays  <cit> . in the meantime, global pcr amplification procedures have been optimised and claimed better than ivt for array screening when starting from the sub-pg quantities of rna isolated from single cells  <cit> . as a consequence, numerous reports have compared the performance of pcr and ivt on decreasing amounts of starting material. some of these extended the comparison to mrna or total rna as un-amplified standards although these standards appeared debatable  <cit> .

since their first use, both linear and exponential amplification processes became commercially available  and evolved into  <dig> to  <dig> different protocols. the original ivt protocol  <cit>  has been worked out by baugh et al.  <cit>  to make it more specific, by moll et al.  <cit>  to make it more efficient and by schlingemann et al.  <cit>  to adapt it to oligo-arrays composed of sense oriented oligonucleotides. similarly, the original pcr protocol has evolved into a new amplification process known as the smart protocol  <cit> . several reports compared smart amplified targets to ivt  <cit>  and/or global pcr  <cit> . improvements of the original brady's protocol have also been worked out and compared to total rna  <cit> . at last, alternatives to ivt or pcr have also been proposed such as a pcr step followed by an ivt step, an ivt step followed by a pcr step, the use of single-stranded cdna instead of double-stranded cdna  or the use of subtraction prior to rna amplification . these recent procedures have also been compared to ivt or total rna and sound promising . they fall beyond the scope of this paper.

in all these studies fidelity, reproducibility and linearity of rna amplification has been a major concern and increasingly refined statistics have been used accordingly  to identify amplification biases through deviating expression patterns between amplified and un-amplified material. however, the possible differences between the sequences affected by pcr and ivt amplification defaults were only rarely explored. we thus aimed at studying the biases of moderate amplification protocols as well as their major characteristics, using an in-house developed protocol for the global pcr amplification  <cit>  and taking into account in-house criteria linked to our biological purposes. we thus decided to use a small set of in vivo elongating embryos, recovered after uterus flushing, to screen different arrays with the same embryonic material . second, we chose a bovine array dedicated to these bovine stages rather than a larger affymetrix array where sequences from this embryonic repertoire were not present. third, we preferred moderate amplifications to intense ones, as routinely practiced on oocytes and earlier embryonic stages, since intense amplifications cost more and have drawbacks too.

on this basis, we showed that deviating expressions affected 16% of the array after pcr or ivt amplifications, formed  <dig> gene subsets which did not overlap  and corresponded to housekeeping genes from physiological or cellular processes. nevertheless, differential expressions were relevant and displayed relative expression levels which were biologically similar, though not identical, between amplified and unamplified samples.

RESULTS
experimental design
our purpose was to analyse moderate amplifications on tissues of similar but also different molecular complexities to analyse the relevance and biases in gene profiling studies following rna amplification. to this aim, we selected two protocols  and five tissues: three embryonic tissues of equivalent molecular complexities as revealed by sage data on ovoid, tubular and filamentous stages in pig  <cit>  and two adult tissues of different complexities  as described by human sage and est data  <cit> .

to focus the design on technological variability, we reduced the biological variability as much as we could . for example, the tissues  were collected on a limited number of pregnant cows. total rna from brain and ovary was extracted from different pieces of tissue and pooled thereafter to get a single rna pool for each tissue. similarly, rna from individual embryos was extracted and pooled per stage since biological pooling was acceptable there due to our methodological focus  <cit> . global pcr or ivt one round was then applied to  <dig> μg of total rna from each tissue. concomitantly, poly a+ rna from brain and ovary was purified from the corresponding pools of total rna and used in slot-blots to assess the biological quality of the amplified material. this has not been done on embryos due to a limited amount of material. we chose slot-blots instead of real-time pcr to assess the quality of the amplified material since a validation of a global pcr by a pcr did not seem reasonable to us due to similar enzymatic drawbacks.

amplified material from each tissue  was indirectly labelled using "random" hexamers. as advised  <cit>  replicates were emphasized and deliberately focused on technical points. three or two independent targets for each tissue and each protocol  were thus generated and hybridised to  <dig> replicates of the same array , so that  <dig> measurements per probe were generated for somatic  and embryonic samples . to find out gene expression differences between protocols or embryonic stages, appropriate statistical analyses have been applied on each set of data.

rna amplifications: optimisation and quality
since drawbacks were reported for both ivt and pcr based protocols which could originate from a too long ivt  or too many cycles of pcr , we first challenged our protocols on our tissues to define optimal amplification conditions. the protocols were tested using increasing in vitro transcription time or pcr cycle number, with a special look at  <dig> transcripts:  <dig> endogenous and  <dig> exogenous transcripts in brain and ovary,  <dig> endogenous transcript in developing embryos. transcripts encoding ef1α, l23a and cytochrome oxidase iii were selected as somatic controls because of a differential expression between brain and ovary, an easy detection on slot blots with poly a+ rna and a different length:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively . as a result, an in vitro transcription of  <dig> h and  <dig> rounds of  <dig> pcr cycles on 1/ <dig> of the reverse transcription looked optimal since  the size of the "spiking" transcripts was conserved  no shortage or degradation of the amplified material was observed and  the amount of spiking transcripts had increased linearly with the time of the ivt or the number of cycles in the pcr .

comparing the  <dig> amplified targets generated on the somatic tissues, it appeared that the anti-sense rna  obtained after ivt corresponded to molecules of  <dig>  to  <dig> kb with a mean size of  <dig> bp while the cdna fragments generated by global pcr were reduced in size:  <dig>  to  <dig> kb, with a mean size of  <dig> bp . interestingly cdna populations were similar for brain and ovary  whereas arna populations displayed slightly different patterns . however, the  <dig> arna targets generated from brain or ovary were similar . these results underlined a good reproducibility in the production of target replicates, a slightly different distribution of rna species between tissues with ivt and a more homogeneous pattern between tissues with pcr.

to further assess the quality of the amplified material generated on each tissue by ivt or pcr, we took advantage of the endogenous and exogenous transcripts which were used to calibrate the protocols and studied their expression in amplified versus un-amplified material . the l23a mrna, slightly more expressed in ovary than in brain according to poly a+ rna, kept the same profile after amplification . conversely, the stronger expression of ef1α in the ovary was either increased  or attenuated  whereas the stronger expression in brain of the cytochrome oxidase iii mrna was weakened after ivt and abolished after pcr. interestingly enough the exogenous mrna, which was equally added in the rna from brain and ovary , appeared more expressed in the ovary after ivt but not after pcr. using the interferon-tau transcript as endogenous control for bovine developing embryos  we showed that the amount of this sequence increased from the ovoid to the filamentous stage after amplification  as it does in vivo . on this very small set of transcripts it was obvious that under and over representations occurred during amplification, but to which extent and with which impact on gene expression differences?

global features of somatic and embryonic hybridisations
as previously advised by n'guyen  <cit> , we first determined the amount of labelled target to be used for each hybridisation so that no additional signal appeared but the intensity of the positive signals increased when the amount of target did . on this basis,  <dig> ng of each target has been hybridised to each array with no particular focus on the relative amplification rates and the subsequent equivalence between these targets.

considering the somatic hybridisations, pcr amplified targets gave a double amount of valid signals as compared to ivt amplified ones , when valid meant observed on  <dig> thirds of the arrays. in this case, common signals represented 90% of the ivt signals but only 45% of the pcr ones. this however was not true when valid meant detected on all the arrays with intensities  <dig> times over the background. indeed, such a stringent calculation gave similar numbers of signals with ivt or pcr amplifications:  <dig> versus  <dig> with brain and  <dig> versus  <dig> with ovary, respectively. conversely, embryonic targets  displayed similar numbers of signals at each stage but  <dig> to  <dig> times more signals than somatic ones, as expected from an array enriched in embryonic probes. moreover, common signals between embryonic targets represented  <dig> to 80% of the signals generated by ivt and pcr amplifications.

when analysed per protocol, the technical replicates  proved to be nicely correlated as evidenced by the corresponding scatter plots . briefly, the coefficients of correlation were between  <dig> – <dig>  for the hybridisations after pcr or ivt amplification:  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the somatic signals and  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the embryonic ones . however, the correlation between pcr and ivt amplified products was much lower . the scatter plots revealed additionally a large number of signals with a very low coefficient of correlation which corresponded to signals of high intensity with pcr amplifications but low intensity with ivt and vice versa . these signals generated a crab-like figure of high interest with respect to amplification distortions.

we thus confirmed a high correlation within methods, an intermediate correlation between methods and evidenced a divergence between methods for at least a subset of the array. we thus aimed at its characterisation.

amplification distortions in somatic and embryonic hybridisations
gene expression differences between amplification methods  were identified with the tmev  <dig>  software. analysing the whole array ,  <dig> gene expression differences were identified whatever the tissues. interestingly most of them were localised into the "crab claws" previously identified in the scatter plots between pcr and ivt amplified samples . before any other analysis this result suggested that these differences were amplification discrepancies. repeating the analysis on the core array ,  <dig> gene expression differences appeared significant between pcr and ivt amplified samples. these ones localised differently , showing that the crab claws were mostly due to the mitochondrial sequences  which were largely redundant  within the whole array. though biologically not challenging, this drawback  highlighted a specific pcr bias towards 12srrna sequences which could not be visualised on arrays containing highly selected cdnas. reverse transcription being mostly achieved on total rna, this however was of methodological interest since those sequences incorporate a part of the isotope during the labelling.

applying a clustering analysis to the relevant differences identified between amplified samples from embryonic and somatic tissues ,  <dig> appeared at first glance attributable to ivt and  <dig> to pcr . however, in the absence of unamplified standards such as mrna targets or total rna targets, one cannot distinguish higher ivt expressions due to ivt induced over-expressions or pcr induced under-expressions, and vice versa. we thus named these groups of genes panel  <dig> and panel  <dig> instead of ivt and pcr. most of these deviating expressions corresponded to genes involved in similar processes: 75% and 71% in physiological and cellular processes, respectively . as expected from the clustering results, the deviating gene differences from panel  <dig> fell into the highest intensities of the ivt data and lowest intensities of the pcr data whereas those from panel  <dig> showed the opposite distribution . obviously, the density of these deviating genes over unamplified data would have been of high interest to sort out the part of ivt and/or pcr defaults in these deviating expression differences.  <dig> and  <dig> genes referenced in the unigene bos taurus index were respectively identified within panel  <dig> and panel  <dig> . in panel  <dig>  the endogenous controls encoding rpl23a and ef1α were recognised thus confirming that some of the deviating expressions we observed on fig.  <dig> were due to ivt induced over-expressions . to further know whether molecular features such as transcript size, gc content or presence of hairpins could partly explain such deviations, we explored these features on the amplification affected sequences from both panels.

we first found  that the sequences from panel  <dig>  displayed a reduced size as compared to those from panel 1:  <dig> pb against  <dig> pb  corresponded to significantly smaller sized cdnas: 850– <dig> pb against 900– <dig> pb  were more frequently located in the 3' end of the cdnas:  <dig> to 50% of the bt. length and  displayed a lower gc content. nevertheless, this last difference stopped being significant when the full length cdnas were compared  likely due to a "buffering" effect of the coding regions where the gc contents are often closer to 45%. considering hairpins as potential pausing sites, da stretches as internal oligo-dt priming sites and promoter-like sequences as alternative rna polymerase initiating sites, we then observed that sequences from panel  <dig> contained also more hairpins  and a stretches  than those from panel  <dig>  they displayed however similar contents of promoter-like sequences .

conclusively, it appeared that systematic biases arose during both amplification procedures independently of  the sample used: brain, ovary or embryos,  the enzymatic properties initially inferred  and  the preliminary optimisation of the protocols. these distortions affected 16% of the core array  and involved different subsets of genes  which harboured different molecular properties.

gene expression differences between embryonic stages
knowing from above that systematic biases arose during amplification  and affected 16% of the core array , we wondered whether gene expression differences identified between embryonic stages with amplified samples could be both reliable and relevant.

 <dig> gene expression differences were identified between stages  with pcr amplified samples and  <dig> with ivt amplified ones. among these,  <dig> were ivt specific,  <dig> pcr specific and  <dig> were commonly identified . the common ones  encoded  <dig> genes referenced in the unigene bos taurus index and corresponded to transcripts identified in another study using ivt amplified samples only  <cit> . we showed therein that c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and tkdp <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed among these stages . the ivt specific differences  encoded  <dig> genes referenced in the bos taurus index,  <dig> of which were known as reliable differential expressions: ifn-tau , cox <dig>  <cit> , c <dig> and pag <dig>  <cit> . similarly, the pcr specific differences  encoded  <dig> genes referenced in the bos taurus index,  <dig> of which were also known as reliable differences: c <dig>  c <dig>  tkdp <dig>  pag <dig> and ifn-tau. surprisingly, they were not identified as common differences between pcr and ivt amplified samples. looking in more details at the corresponding est it appeared clearly that, although located in the same bt., they did not overlap. extending this analysis to the list of specific differences  we found that the est from the pcr group were frequently located at the 3'end of the referenced cdnas , as compared to those from the ivt group , and displayed reduced sizes . last but not least, a few differences identified between embryonic stages with pcr amplified samples  matched with those identified in panel  <dig>  whereas no intercept was detected with panel  <dig> 

since these differential patterns were detected with amplified embryonic targets, we compared their relative expression ratios between amplified and unamplified rna . we thus quantified c <dig>  c <dig> and pag <dig> expression levels between stages as revealed by former northern blots  <cit>  and performed real-time pcr on  <dig> new transcripts: cox <dig>  and ifn-tau . from these results, one clearly sees that the differential ratios between stages were biologically similar, though not identical. indeed, the differential ratios for cox <dig> looked smaller at some stages with ivt targets whereas the differential ratios of ifn-tau, c <dig> and pag <dig> appeared smaller with pcr targets. nevertheless, only one inverted ratio appeared between ivt and pcr: the c <dig> ratio between tubular and filamentous stages.

as a final view, gene expression differences identified between embryonic stages with amplified samples were both reliable  and relevant . in addition, the molecular features observed on the differential est identified by ivt or pcr amplifications suggest that global pcr favoured the representation of short cdna harbouring rather low gc contents.

discussion
this work illustrated the questions frequently asked since  <dig> about rna amplification and showed that even with optimised and reproducible protocols deviating gene expressions affected 16% of our array and appeared whatever the tissue. these biases, linked to the abundance or the molecular features of the sequences affected by amplification defaults, corresponded mainly to housekeeping genes from physiological and cellular processes. differential expressions, however, were found reliable and relevant with biologically similar expression ratios between amplified and unamplified material.

similar biases were reported in previous studies using also moderate ivt and pcr amplifications. they evidenced either contradictory expression ratios or missing spots  <cit>  but also a vast majority of expression patterns which differed only in the magnitude of the differential expression  <cit> . in our study, only one gene out of the five tested showed an inversed ratio at one stage after pcr amplification, whereas most of them showed ratios which differed only in their magnitudes. all of them however were relevant as confirmed by northern blots or real-time pcr. interestingly, the deviating genes from our study corresponded mainly to housekeeping genes whereas those identified by van haaften  rather included transcription factors. as an alternative to minimise distortions, real-time detection of amplified products has been proposed to prevent over-amplification in pcr-based protocols  <cit>  and a similar approach has been used before and after ivt amplifications to discriminate between well and badly amplified samples  <cit> . this has also been used to follow ivt amplifications on bovine oocytes and early embryos .

the possible differences between the sequences affected by amplification defaults were however rarely explored. van haaften observed that the reporters that disappeared after ivt amplification  had a gc content of about 54% and displayed more hairpins of longer sizes than the other reporters . a higher gc content has also been observed in deviating genes after pcr amplification with the smart protocol  <cit> . the authors correlated this feature to the temperature of the enzymatic reaction  and to the gc content of their plant genome. this was surprising to us since gc rich fragments are often difficult pcr templates, requiring sometimes dmso or betaine addition. in our study, we could not assign the distortions from panel  <dig> and panel  <dig> to ivt or pcr defaults since, without a standard, it was impossible to distinguish ivt over-expression from pcr under-expression and vice versa. it was clear however that these  <dig> gene subsets did not overlap: different molecular features, different signal intensities and different gene id. est from panel  <dig> displayed reduced sizes, were more frequently located in the 3'end of the cdnas and displayed a lower gc content than those from panel  <dig>  they also contained more hairpins  and a stretches  than those from panel  <dig> but displayed similar contents of promoter-like sequences. since est corresponding to true differential expressions identified by pcr targets were frequently located at the 3'end of the referenced cdnas and displayed reduced sizes , one would suggest that deviating genes from panel  <dig> could display a pcr signature.

CONCLUSIONS
from this work, it was not really possible to favour pcr over ivt amplification or vice versa. both generated distortions and revealed true differential expressions between embryonic stages , so that one would rather advise  using only one protocol to keep amplification factors and biases equal  monitoring the amplification process as offered now through real-time pcr and  searching for protocol specific expression differences or gene-protocol interactions before any differential analysis on a new dataset or a new array. obviously, the choice between those protocols is also a question of total rna input, time, cost and available arrays since amplified targets enriched in 3'end fragments will not hybridise to ssh fragments or 5'positioned oligos. last but not least, knowing that taq polymerases make more mistakes than rna polymerases do, ivt may be favoured over pcr to hybridise highly discriminating oligo-arrays or arrays from other species.
