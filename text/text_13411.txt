BACKGROUND
enrichment of tumour cells to a purity of more than 90% is highly desirable for accurate results in many applications, especially for rt-pcr and microarray based expression analysis  <cit> . in b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia , such purities have usually been achieved by density gradient centrifugation  and subsequent fluorescent-activated cell sorting  or by magnetic cell sorting  for cd <dig> positive cells  <cit> .

studies focusing on expression analysis in cll utilising microarrays report median purities of  <dig> and 90% of cd <dig> positive cells using dgc  <cit>  though it is likely that selection occurred for samples with high purity. one study applying dgc and facs of mononuclear cells reported purities of between  <dig> and 95% of cd5–cd <dig> co-expressing cells  <cit> . three studies  <cit>  reported purities higher than 97% of cd <dig> positive cells after dgc and mcs. although high purity is achieved with facs and mcs, both are time and cost intensive procedures which often are limited in terms of tumour cell yields and applicability, since they require expensive equipment and the processing time depends on the sample volume. another potential disadvantage is that they are positive selection approaches which might alter gene expression through the activation of cell surface receptors  <cit> .

our study focused on adapting a negative selection method that could offer the required purity after the dgc step thereby markedly cutting down the time and cost of sample processing and reducing the risk of altering the gene expression pattern.

we used a bifunctional antibody cocktail for b-cell enrichment ) that binds erythrocytes  on one side and white cell populations other than b-cells  on the other side thus forming dense rosettes of erythrocytes surrounding the unwanted white blood cells when added to whole blood. the increased density of the rosetted cells results in their pelleting by subsequent dgc. this combination of rs incubation and subsequent density gradient centrifugation  thus results in the depletion of undesired cells and leaves purified b-cells behind that can be harvested from the interface  <cit> . here, we investigate whether rs+dgc can also effectively isolate cll cells at high purity from peripheral blood .

RESULTS
a preliminary experiment was used to assess the optimal rs concentration that resulted in the best purity. aliquots of three cll samples were treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μl rs/ml pb to monitor the effect on the resulting purity. the experiments indicated that a concentration of  <dig> μl rs/ml pb resulted in the best purity . this was the concentration used to subsequently enrich all cll samples.

enrichment with rs+dgc was performed in less than  <dig> minutes and showed higher purities of cd5/cd <dig> co-expressing cells for every sample compared to the enrichment with dgc alone. the analysed pb samples of cll patients showed an average cll cell purity of  <dig> %  after dgc . after rs+dgc enrichment, the same samples exhibited an average cll cell purity of  <dig> % . the average purity of cd5/cd <dig> co-expressing cells was raised from  <dig> % after dgc to  <dig> % after rs+dgc. the average percentage of cd5- cd19+ , cd5- cd19-  and cd5+ cd19- cells  was reduced from  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively after rs+dgc .

the purity of the enriched cll cells  increased with the wbc count of the samples . rs+dgc enrichment resulted in a cll purity of greater than 90% for all  <dig> of the  <dig> samples that showed a wbc count higher than  <dig> × 106cells/ml pb, while the  <dig> samples with a wbc count between  <dig> and  <dig> × 106cells/ml pb showed cll purity between  <dig> and 90% after rs+dgc enrichment. the consistently higher purities achieved with rs+dgc in all  <dig> samples compared to dgc alone show the efficacy of the rosette based enrichment method, and is comparable with purities achieved by mcs and facs and superior in terms of time and cost .

dgc: density gradient centrifugation, rs+dgc: rosettesep incubation prior to dgc, dgc+mcs: dgc and subsequent magnetic cell sorting, dgc+facs: dgc and subsequent fluorescent activated cell sorting.

a average purity experienced in our study

b purity reported by haslinger et al., 2004

c purity reported by falt et al., 2005

d purity reported by rosenwald et al.,  <dig> and wiestner et al., 2003

e huttman et al., 2006

f purity reported by stankovic et al., 2004

not surprisingly, the cell yield also depended on the wbc count . the number of cells harvested can be regulated by increasing  the volume of blood to be processed and by adjusting the volume of added rs antibody cocktail accordingly without any effect on the processing time of  <dig> minutes. this is another potential advantage over facs and mcs where increased cell numbers require increased processing time.

the rna extracted from enriched cells using rs+dgc displayed an average rin of  <dig>  , indicating high-quality rna  that subsequently gave excellent results on microarray analysis .

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows that negative selection using a bifunctional rosette-based antibody cocktail is an effective method to isolate cll cells of high purity, especially in samples with a wbc count above  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml. the short purification time, the independence from expensive and time consuming procedures, such as facs and mcs , and the flexible adjustment of cell yields makes rs+dgc an attractive purification method for a wide spectrum of downstream applications, particularly expression analysis utilising microarrays, in which a cll purity of >90% is desirable.
