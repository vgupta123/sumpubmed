BACKGROUND
bioglass 60s  has a molar composition of 4 % p2o <dig>  36 % cao and 60 % sio <dig>  is a biomaterial with favourable characteristics for bone regeneration  <cit>  and displays beneficial effects on the repair of bone defects in dog jaws  <cit> . but nothing is known about the effect of this biomaterial on the activity of dog osteoblasts, especially as regards the production of extracellular matrix and osteogenic differentiation. generally speaking, when the bioglass is implanted on the bone tissue, it provides a framework for migration and colonization by osteoblasts, and apart from this, it reacts with the interstitial fluids, releasing ions, mainly calcium and silicon  <cit> , which are, probably, primarily responsible for the biological effect.. these ions may favour osteogenic proliferation  <cit>  and differentiation in vitro  <cit> . however, the ideal chemical composition of bioglass that releases the ideal combination and concentration of ions to maximise the bone regeneration process upon implantation is not well understood. in an in vitro study with rat osteoblasts, bg60s exhibited satisfactory ca and si release rates, which favours cellular proliferation  <cit> . however, the effects of this biomaterial on canine osteoblast activity are unknown. osteoblasts perform a crucial function in the bone regeneration process by producing and secreting the extracellular bone matrix. the objective of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that the ionic product  of bg60s will increase the synthesis and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix by evaluating the effect of the ip on canine osteoblastic activity.

RESULTS
concentrations of si and ca ions in cell culture media
when added to cell culture media, bg60s was partially dissolved, causing a significant increase in the concentration of si and ca ions. the concentration of si ions was  <dig>  mg/l in ip dmem medium ,  <dig>  mg/l in ip ost medium  and lower than 1 mg/l in the media with no contact with bg60s . the concentration of ca ions was  <dig>  mg/l in dmem medium,  <dig>  mg/l in ost medium, 169 mg/l in ip dmem medium and  <dig>  mg/l in ip ost medium. hence, bg60s increased the concentration of ca ions by  <dig> and 79 % in basal and osteogenic media, respectively.

discussion
the biological effect of biomaterials can be evaluated by their dissolution product  <cit>  because the ions liberated during dissolution contribute for the biological effect  <cit> . the increased concentration of si  and ca ions  from the dissolution of bg60s was expected; however, it was significantly higher than the values reported in the literature with bioglass of different compositions  <cit> . this result indicates that the same type of biomaterial can produce different results according to the specific composition, which explains the various responses found in the literature.

the increase in ap activity in group ip dmem relative to group dmem at  <dig> and 14 days suggests a stimulating effect of the ip on the secreting activity of the osteoblast. ap is an enzyme that occurs in the membrane of the osteoblast, and it directly participates in the synthesis and mineralisation of bone matrix  <cit> . this enzyme is commonly used as a marker of osteogenic differentiation  <cit>  and a parameter for the evaluation of the bone activity, and high ap activity also indicates high osteoblastic activity  <cit> .

the significant increase of the extracellular matrix area and greater mineralisation of the extracellular matrix observed in cultures that received the ip shows the stimulating effect that ips of bg60s have on osteoblasts with regard to matrix synthesis and mineralisation. the synthesis and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix are considered the most reliable and representative parameters of in vitro osteoblastic activity  <cit> . the predominant increase of osx, bsp and on expression in the cultures that received the ip relative to those that did not suggests that the ip of bg60s stimulates the synthesis and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix by increasing the expression of these proteins. osx is a specific transcription factor of osteogenic differentiation  <cit>  that acts on the transformation of pre-osteoblasts into mature osteoblasts  <cit> . furthermore, osx acts on the synthesis and mineralisation of bone matrix via the intranuclear receptor of vitamin d and on the inhibition of osteoblastic proliferation via the inhibition of wnt  signalling  <cit> . bsp and on are non-collagen proteins in bone matrix used as markers of osteogenic differentiation and osteoblastic activity  <cit> . these proteins are intimately related to the synthesis and mineralisation process of extracellular bone matrix  <cit> . although the ip did not clearly increase oc expression, the increase in its expression in the ip ost group at  <dig> and 21 days suggests that the ions released by bg60s can also positively influence its expression. oc is a specific bone tissue glycoprotein expressed by osteoblasts and is considered the main non-collagen protein of bone matrix  <cit> . the evaluation of its expression can be used for monitoring bone metabolism  <cit> .

the beneficial effects of the ip of bg60s on osteoblastic activity are most likely caused by the si and ca ions released during its dissolution process. studies with rat osteoblast cultures have demonstrated that si can increase cellular activity and proliferation  <cit>  as well as the expression of runx <dig>  collagen type  <dig> and on  <cit> . furthermore, si can favour the mineralisation of extracellular matrix  <cit> . ca is another ion released during bg60s dissolution, and it can increase the activity and proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . studies have indicated that extracellular ca can increase osteopontin, oc, bsp and bone morphogenetic protein- <dig>  expression in human mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . additionally, ca favours the synthesis and mineralisation of extracellular matrix by human mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . the previously mentioned studies have indicated that ca favours in vitro osteogenesis; however, little is known of the mechanisms involved. the increase in extracellular ca can increase the expression of osteopontin and bsp in mouse pre-osteoblasts, an effect mediated by l-type ca channels and the ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  signalling pathway  <cit> .

with the limitations of the current study, there is only assessment of the 60s bio-glass in the form of its ionic product. although assessment of the product of dissolving the 60s bio-glass may bring important information concerning its form of action, the biological response of a biomaterial may also be influenced by the size, form, microstructure, texture and topography of the implant surface. thus, it is important to carry out complementary studies that may assess all these variables, allowing for a better understanding as to how each one of them influences its biological response.

CONCLUSIONS
the ip of bg60s alters the gene expression of canine osteoblasts, favouring the synthesis and mineralisation of extracellular matrix.
