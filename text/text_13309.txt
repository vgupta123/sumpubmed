BACKGROUND
cell-penetrating peptides  are short positively charged peptides containing less than  <dig> amino acid residues. they exhibit low toxicity and have the capacity to cross cellular membranes by energy-dependent and/or independent mechanisms  <cit> . in the process, cpps can transport different molecules such as nanoparticles  <cit> , liposomes  <cit> , proteins  <cit> , peptides  <cit> , and oligonucleotides  into living cells. different delivery strategies such as direct conjugation, co-incubation, and non-covalent or covalent cross-linking of cpps with target molecules  have been investigated so far.

several factors currently limit the preclinical and clinical development of cpps. fist, cpps require custom synthesis, are expensive, and can be easily degraded by intracellular or extracellular proteases  <cit> . second, the crosslinking efficiency of cpps with target molecules is low  <cit> . therefore, a simple, safe, effective, stable, and cost-effective delivery vehicle for cpps is needed to improve their stability and utilization efficiency.

bacteriophage pp <dig> virus-like particles  may be a promising tool in meeting the above requirements as a cpp delivery vehicle because pp <dig> vlps can be expressed in escherichia coli  strains such as csh41f  <cit> . additionally, the pp <dig> coat protein has the ability to self-assemble into vlps in the absence of viral rna, and these vlps in turn can serve as a vector for peptides  <cit> . specifically, in the viral capsid, the β-hairpin structures at the n terminus of the coat protein subunits protruding from the surface of pp <dig> vlps can tolerate foreign peptides  <cit> . these peptides can be inserted between amino acid residues  <dig> and  <dig> of the second subunit of the coat protein single-chain dimer  <cit> . the insertion of dna oligonucleotides at this site allows the production of chimeric pp <dig> coat proteins that have the foreign peptide placed in the central part of the hairpin. most importantly, the displayed peptides are highly immunogenic  <cit> . furthermore, the pp <dig> vlps with the inserted peptides are heat-resistant up to about 70 °c and are therefore more stable than ms <dig> vlps that resist heat up to 50 °c  <cit> .

to date, the pp <dig> vlps have been used as peptide vaccine carriers against the human papillomavirus  <cit>  and malaria parasite  <cit> . however, whether cpps can also be successfully displayed on the surface of pp <dig> vlps and additionally retain their cell-penetrating function have not been examined yet. it is also known that pp <dig> vlps encapsidate coat protein-specific messenger rna   <cit> ; however, whether they can encapsidate foreign mrna has not been investigated either. therefore, in this study, we have chosen the low molecular weight protamine   peptide as the model cpp and analyzed the expression of pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp in e. coli strain bl <dig> . we also evaluated the cell-penetrating ability of the inserted lmwp and analyzed whether pp <dig> vlps could package the foreign mrna.

RESULTS
insertion of the lmwp peptide into the pp <dig> coat protein dimer
the expression vector of pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide was constructed as follows: the 771-bp coding sequence of 2pp <dig> with one introduced restriction enzyme site kpni  was first inserted between the ndei and xhoi restriction sites of the prokaryotic expression vector petduet- <dig>  the obtained vector was named petduet-2pp7; it encodes for a  <dig>  kda protein with  <dig> amino acid residues. the cdna of lmwp was then inserted after the kpni site , which is located in the second ab-loop of the pp <dig> coat protein and can tolerates peptide insertions  <cit> . the resulting constructed vector was named petduet-2pp7-protamine. all positive clones were screened by colony pcr and verified by sequencing.fig.  <dig> insertion of the lmwp peptide into the pp <dig> coat protein dimer. the cdna sequence of lmwp  was inserted after the kpni site of the vector petduet-2pp <dig> . the possible structure of the pp <dig> coat protein dimer carrying lmwp with the ab-loops shown in ribbon was predicted using the program rasmol  <dig> . <dig> 



to predict whether the pp <dig> coat protein could tolerate the insertion of lmwp peptide, the program rasmol  <dig> . <dig> was used. the results showed the pp <dig> coat protein could indeed tolerate the insertion of the lmwp peptide. the secondary structure of lmwp after having been inserted in the pp <dig> coat protein was mainly β-sheet and β-turn .

last, the plasmid petduet-2pp7-protamine-gfp was constructed by inserting the gfp gene between the xbai and bamhi restriction sites of the plasmid petduet-2pp7-protamine. the correct construct was also verified by sequencing.

expression of recombinant 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps in e. coli
to analyze the expression of pp <dig> vlps carrying the peptide or not carrying the peptide, the three recombinant expression vectors above were transformed into e. coli. the results showed three recombinant vlps: 2pp <dig> vlps, 2pp7-protamine vlps, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp, each expressed intracellularly from the plasmids petduet-2pp <dig>  petduet-2pp7-protamine, and petduet-2pp7-protamine-gfp respectively. the above vlps represented a dominant protein species in the supernatant of lysed bacteria after centrifugation . furthermore, 2pp <dig> coat protein, 2pp7-protamine coat protein, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp coat protein were found in the precipitate, but whether these could fold into vlps was not determined. sds-page analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the single-chain dimer of pp <dig> phage coat protein carrying the lmwp or not carrying the lmwp was approximately 33 kda, and the latter was smaller than the former .fig.  <dig> expression of recombinant 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps in e. coli. a expression of 2pp7-protamine and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps in the supernatant of bl <dig>  after sonication. lanes of bl <dig>  carrying each plasmid are designated as follows: lane  <dig>  plasmid petduet-2pp7-protamine-gfp with iptg added; lane  <dig>  plasmid petduet-2pp7-protamine without iptg added; lane  <dig>  petduet-2pp7-protamine without iptg added; lane  <dig>  petduet-2pp7-protamine with iptg added; lane  <dig>  petduet-2pp <dig> with iptg added. b-d purification of the vlps. the peaks of the target proteins are marked by red arrows



the vlps were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography . the western blotting results showed the vlps existed in the first elution peak , and the expression levels of the purified 2pp <dig> vlps, 2pp7-protamine vlps, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps extracted from the supernatant of 1 l of overnight culture after sonication were approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/l, respectively. these results demonstrated that pp <dig> vlps carrying lmwp or not carrying lmwp could be expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  with high-efficiency; however, the fusion of the peptide to pp <dig> coat protein and the inserted gfp gene in the second multiple cloning sites  of the plasmid petduet-2pp7-protamine decreased the expression of the pp <dig> vlps.fig.  <dig> recognition and assembly of the pp7coat protein dimer carrying lmwp into whole vlps. a western blot of vpls: lane  <dig>  tbs; lane  <dig>  2pp <dig> vlps; lane  <dig>  2pp7-protamine vlps; lane  <dig>  2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps; lane  <dig>  bl <dig>  carrying petduet- <dig> induced by iptg. b-d vlps observed using tem at 60 kv and  <dig> × screen magnification



assembly of the pp <dig> coat protein dimer carrying the lmwp peptide into whole vlps
to confirm that the purified products successfully assembled into pp <dig> vlps, western blotting and tem were performed. the western blotting results showed only one specific band appearing in every lane, which demonstrated that all three recombinant vlps could be detected by the murine antibody of the anti-coat protein of pp <dig> phage . in addition, the tem results indicated that the recombinant pp <dig> capsids could assemble into the whole virus-like particles with a diameter of about 30 nm , which was similar to that of wild-type pp <dig> vlps.

packaging and protection from degradation of the rna linked with pp <dig> pac site by the recombinant pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide
the chromatogram showed nucleic acid was present in the first peak, indicating that nucleic acids were packaged by the pp <dig> vlps . to verify this result and examine the type of nucleic acid  that was packaged by the pp <dig> vlps, a nuclease-resistance assay and rt-pcr were performed. results from the nuclease-resistance assay showed that, after incubation of 2pp <dig> vlps, 2pp7-protamine vlps, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps with dnase i and rnase a, a band was observed in each lane but at different locations . these results showed that nucleic acids with different characteristics in terms of lengths and folding degrees were packaged by the pp <dig> vlps.fig.  <dig> nuclease-resistance assay of mrna packaged by the pp <dig> capsid carrying lmwp. a the purified 2pp <dig> vlps, 2pp7-protamine vlps and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps  were separately mixed with dnase i  and rnase a , incubated at 37 °c for 12 h, and verified by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis: lane m, dl  <dig> dna marker; lane  <dig>  2pp7-protamine vlps; lane  <dig>  2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps; lane  <dig>  2pp <dig> vlps. b verification of nucleic acids packaged by 2pp7-protamine vlps  and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps . the pcr products in different lanes were as follows: lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  reverse transcription product of rna extracted from corresponding vlps; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  rna extracted from corresponding vlps; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  purified vlp sample; lanes  <dig> and  <dig>  reverse transcription product of purified vlps sample; lane  <dig>  ddh2o. m <dig>  dl  <dig> dna marker; m <dig>  dl  <dig> dna marker



following the above assay, the dnas or rnas packaged by these vlps were further verified by rt-pcr. the results showed that the rna and not dna was the nucleic acid packaged by these vlps . moreover, the rnas most likely packaged by the 2pp7-protamine vlps and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps were the mrnas of pp <dig> coat protein carrying lmwp and gfp . the results indicated that the pp <dig> vlps carrying lmwp retained the ability to package mrna and therefore could be used as a delivery vector of mrna.

cytotoxicity and thermal stability of 2pp7-protamine and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps
the cytotoxicity of 2pp <dig>  2pp7-protamine, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps was examined in the african green monkey kidney fibroblast cell line cos- <dig> using cck- <dig> assay. the results showed no dose-dependent cytotoxicity in these three vlps . even at a high concentration of 800 μg/ml of vlps, cell viability was higher than 95 %, demonstrating low cytotoxicity of recombinant 2pp <dig>  2pp7-protamine, and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps.fig.  <dig> cytotoxicity and thermal stability of 2pp7-protamine and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps. 2pp7-protamine and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps show low cytotoxicity in cos- <dig> cells  and high thermal stability at different temperatures . the cytotoxicity has been expressed in terms of cell viability



at the same time, the thermal stability of these three vlps was determined by measuring the protein concentration at different temperatures. the results showed that the concentrations of 2pp <dig>  2pp7-protamine and 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps decreased significantly at above 60 °c , indicating that they resisted heating up to about 60 °c. additionally, the stability of these three vlps was identical at the same temperature . the results showed the high thermal stability of the pp <dig> vlps carrying lmwp and of those not carrying lmwp.

cell-penetrating ability of pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide
to explore whether recombinant pp <dig> vlps carrying lmwp can penetrate cells, the 2pp7-protamine vlps were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate  and incubated with cells from the mouse prostate cancer cell line rm- <dig>  after 12 h, the rm- <dig> cells incubated with 2pp7-protamine vlps exhibited a high level of fluorescence . in contrast, no fluorescence could be detected in the cells incubated with unlabeled 2pp7-protamine vlps or fitc-labeled 2pp <dig> vlps . these results indicate that the lmwp was expressed on the surface of 2pp7-protamine vlps and that these vlps retained strong cell-penetrating ability. therefore, we conclude that display of other targeting cell-penetrating peptides on the surface of pp <dig> vlps will be possible. the strong cell-penetrating ability of the pp <dig> vlps may enhance the in vivo delivery efficiency of rna and lay the foundation for targeted delivery of rna.fig.  <dig> cell-penetrating ability of pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide. strong cell-penetrating ability was observed. pictures were taken under white light or fluorescence 



protein translation of the mrna packaged by pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide
we investigated whether the gfp mrna packaged by the pp <dig> capsid carrying the lmwp peptide could be translated into mature protein in rm- <dig> cells. after 24 h of incubation with 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps, most of the rm- <dig> cells incubated with 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps exhibited green fluorescence , which was identified by the confocal laser scanning microscopy. as shown in fig. 7b, green fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of almost all rm- <dig> cells, while red fluorescence from red fluorescent reactive dye was observed on the membrane of rm- <dig> cells and blue fluorescence from dapi inside the nuclei.fig.  <dig> translation of the mrna packaged by pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide. the expression of gfp in the rm- <dig> cells incubated with 2pp7-protamine vlps or 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps was observed by fluorescence microscopy  or confocal laser scanning microscopy . the levels of gfp mrna in the cells was verified by qpcr 



additionally, the levels of gfp mrna level in the rm- <dig> cells were verified by quantitative real-time pcr  at 24 h and 48 h . as shown in fig. 7c, whether at 24 h or at 48 h, the gfp mrna could not be detected in the cells incubated with 2pp7-protamine vlps. instead, the higher level of gfp mrna was observed in thecells incubated with 2pp7-protamine-gfp vlps . moreover, in this group, the level of gfp mrna at 48 h was significantly higher than that at 24 h. all these results showed that pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide could penetrate cell membrane and that the mrna packaged by them was translated into mature protein in mammalian cells.

discussion
molecules such as mrnas have been used for the prevention and treatment of various diseases , including cancer . however, there are several obstacles in the in vivo application of mrnas, including the low in vivo delivery efficiency of mrna, their lack of cell-type specificity, and instability. in this study, we introduced a delivery system based on pp <dig> vlps and a cell-penetrating peptide as a solution to the above limitations of mrna-targeted delivery.

in order to improve the delivery efficiency of mrna, the pp <dig> vlps were decorated with a non-toxic cell-penetrating peptide, lmwp. this peptide, similar to the peptide tat, enhanced the intracellular delivery of the linked particles without any dependence on receptors, temperature conditions, or energy use and without causing any alterations to the cell membrane . the cell-penetrating assay showed that the lmwp peptide was displayed on the surface of pp <dig> vlps.

previous studies have shown that ms <dig> capsids specifically encapsidate specific mrnas that are linked to the ms <dig> pac site , and our results showed pp <dig> capsids could also do this. as was expected, we found that pp <dig> vlps carrying the cell-penetrating peptide lmwp packaged a specific mrna linked with the pac site and protected the rna from rapid extracellular degradation by rnase. furthermore, the pp <dig> vlps carrying the cell-penetrating peptide lmwp and gfp mrna efficiently penetrated the cell membrane. to date, the greatest length of rna packaged using one wild-type pac site in ms <dig> vlps fused with a peptide was  <dig> bases  <cit> ; the length of the rna using the pp <dig> vlps was  <dig> bases. however, it has not been determined whether more than one kind of rna was packaged by the pp <dig> vlps during their expression in e. coli. the size and characteristics of the foreign rna that were packaged by the peptide fused to the pp <dig> coat protein will therefore need to be studied further.

in addition, the mrna packaged by the pp <dig> vlps showed a high level of protein expression in mammalian cells within 24 h. this result was not in accordance with that observed for the naked mrna vaccine, which showed maximum expression within 12–18 h  <cit> . this finding underscores the high stability of pp <dig> vlps carrying the lmwp peptide.

in  <dig>  caldeira and peabody proved that pp <dig> vlps with a peptide insertion were generally stable up to about 70 °c  <cit> . in this study, the pp <dig> vlps carrying the cell-penetrating peptide lmwp and the gfp mrna showed similar thermal stability up to about 60 °c as those carrying other peptides and, in addition, were more stable than the ms <dig> vlps with peptide insertion.

in summary, our current study demonstrates that pp <dig> vlps carrying a cell-penetrating peptide and mrna can be expressed in e. coli with high efficiency, are easily purified, and are nuclease-resistant, non-replicative, nontoxic, and noninfectious.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study provides a stable and efficient mrna delivery system that is based on the inherent abilities of pp <dig> vlps to encapsidate mrna and tolerate foreign peptides. moreover, the recombinant pp <dig> vlps carrying the cpp and mrna can be easily expressed in a prokaryotic expression system at high yield, are nuclease-resistant, non-replicative, nontoxic, and non-infectious. in addition, the mrna packaged by these vlps showed a high level of protein expression in mammalian cells. in conclusion, this system holds great potential in the development of mrna and peptide-based targeted therapeutics to be used for the prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases.
