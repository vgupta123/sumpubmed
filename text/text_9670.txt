BACKGROUND
the differentiation of specific organs from the endoderm is directly related to their position along the anteroposterior axis of the vertebrate embryo. after initial specification of the endoderm, wnt, nodal, bone morphogenetic protein and fibroblast growth factor  signals quickly subdivide the gut into the foregut, midgut and hindgut  <cit> . expression of hhex, sox <dig> and foxa <dig> are associated with the foregut  <cit>  whereas expression of sox <dig>  <cit>  and cdx  <cit>  genes is eventually restricted to posterior endoderm. the foregut will give rise to the thyroid, thymus, parathyroid, lung, liver, pancreas, and stomach.

although specific transcription factors are associated with each of these organ systems in later development, expression of key transcription factors at early stages is not restricted to a specific organ system. in the foregut, nkx <dig>   is required for development of both the lung and thyroid suggesting a close relationship between these tissues but each organ has a distinct set of transcription factors that are required for differentiation. the thyroid also expresses hhex, pax <dig>  and foxe <dig>  <cit> , although in xenopus and zebrafish, pax <dig> is the pax gene expressed in the thyroid  <cit> . in addition to nkx <dig> , the lung expresses foxa <dig> and foxp <dig>  <cit> . the interplay of many different signalling pathways is necessary for defining both of these organs. fibroblast growth factor  signalling has been shown to be essential for both thyroid  <cit>  and lung although the signal amplitude and timing are important for determining the output from the fgf signal  <cit> .

recently, in addition to fgf signalling, it has been demonstrated that graded levels of retinoic acid  are important in chick for defining the different regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing endoderm  <cit> . the most anterior endoderm, that gives rise to the thyroid, forms with little or no ra although ra is necessary for other anterior endoderm derivatives including the lung  <cit>  and pancreas  <cit> . in frog, aldh1a <dig> , encoding the enzyme primarily responsible for the synthesis of ra, is expressed dynamically throughout development. after gastrulation when patterning of the gut is being established, expression is found in the lateral plate mesoderm overlying the anterior gut with highest levels on the dorsal side. there are discrete regions of expression in the head but on the ventral side, there is little expression anterior to the forming heart  <cit> . this would predict that the forming lung should be exposed to ra but that more posterior endoderm would be exposed to lower levels of ra. the most anterior endoderm, giving rise to the thyroid, should also have limited exposure to ra. later in development, expression of aldh1a <dig> is found in specific gut regions where it is required for the gut looping process  <cit> .

in xenopus, differentiation markers that can be used to study development of the lung have only recently been identified  <cit> . in that study, surfactant protein b  and surfactant protein c  were shown to have high sequence conservation with other homologues and were surprisingly early markers of lung in xenopus, being expressed as early as stage  <dig>  sftpb and sftpc encode important constituents of pulmonary surfactant, a material that regulates surface tension in the lung alveoli and are expressed solely in the lung  <cit> . although the role of thyroid hormone in xenopus biology has been extensively studied  <cit> , the development of the thyroid is not well characterized. expression studies have demonstrated key early transcription factors, identified as essential in other organisms, likely play a role in thyroid development in xenopus including nkx <dig>   <cit> , pax genes  <cit> , foxe <dig>  and foxe <dig>  <cit> , but how the thyroid is specified in frog is not known.

the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the underlying mechanism for the development of the lung and thyroid in xenopus is similar to other model organisms. in doing so, we demonstrate that the requirement for ra and fgf signalling in lung differentiation is conserved in xenopus. furthermore, if exogenous retinoic acid is applied to the embryo after gastrulation, the thyroid primordium will express sftpb and sftpc. in addition, expression of early transcription factors that are normally expressed in the thyroid but not the lung, pax <dig>  foxe <dig>  and hhex are lost in presumptive thyroid in response to retinoic acid. these results further demonstrate that spatial control of specific signalling factors is essential for the patterning of the foregut endoderm and that retinoic acid signalling is a key element of that process.

RESULTS
temporal expression of lung and thyroid markers
to establish a baseline of when the different markers of lung and thyroid are first detectable, their expression was compared by whole mount in situ hybridization . nkx <dig>  expression was first detectable in the thyroid at stage  <dig> and appeared as a small dot immediately caudal to the cement gland. there was only a slight delay before expression of pax <dig> was detected in the thyroid. at stage  <dig>  expression of nkx <dig>  was detectable in the forming lung. as expected, the expression of these key transcription factors preceded the expression of the lung differentiation markers sftpb and sftpc both of which were detectable at stage  <dig> 

retinoic acid and fgf are required for lung development in xenopus
a requirement for both ra and fgf signalling has been demonstrated in mouse lung development  <cit>  and we wished to confirm that this requirement is conserved in xenopus. using a pan-retinoic acid receptor antagonist  <cit> , we were able to show that there is a requirement for ra signalling. however, the ability of the antagonist to suppress lung differentiation, as assayed by sftpb expression is restricted to very early stages of lung development. if ra signalling was blocked at stage  <dig>  well before the expression of nkx <dig> , lung differentiation occurred normally . expression of sftpb was detectable in some embryos when ra signalling was blocked as early as stage  <dig>  although most had no expression and those that did had lower expression levels than control embryos. these results are mirrored by the expression of nkx <dig> . if ra signalling is blocked prior to stage  <dig>  nkx <dig>  expression is lost in the lung although maintained in the thyroid. at stage  <dig> there is lung expression in some embryos and if treatment with the ra antagonist is delayed until stage  <dig>  essentially all embryos express nkx <dig>  in the lung.

if fgf signalling was blocked using the inhibitor su <dig> after stage  <dig>   <dig>  or even stage  <dig>  expression of nkx <dig>  was lost in the lung region whereas the expression in the forming thyroid was maintained . again, as expected, blocking fgf signalling also resulted in a loss of sftpb expression, although some embryos did show some very weak sftpb expression . the loss of fgf signalling was also confirmed by looking at the expression of sprouty <dig>  a direct target of fgf signalling . in addition, expression of foxe <dig> was maintained in the forming thyroid in the presence of su <dig>  this suggests that fgf signalling was required for lung specification but not thyroid specification at the times tested. expression of foxe <dig> in the forming lens was maintained when fgf signalling was blocked but the lens morphology was aberrant when compared to controls in fgf inhibitor treatments that began at stage  <dig> . given that fgf signalling has been implicated in thyroid development in other organisms  <cit> , we also looked at the expression of the other early thyroid marker, pax <dig>  we found that blocking fgf signalling immediately after gastrulation  resulted in no thyroid expression of pax <dig>  although expression in other tissues remained unaffected . when fgf signalling was blocked at stage  <dig>  pax <dig> expression in the thyroid was apparently normal, although expression was not observed in all embryos. treatment at stage  <dig> had no effect on pax <dig> expression in the thyroid.

exogenous retinoic acid causes the thyroid to express the lung developmental program
as the requirement for ra was very early in the process of lung organogenesis, one potential role for retinoic acid could be to determine the number of lung progenitors. therefore, we also treated embryos with exogenous retinoic acid to see if there was an increase in the size of the developing lung. although we did not see any clear increase in lung size, there was ectopic expression of sftpb in a small region of the embryo that corresponded both in size and shape with the developing thyroid . addition of ra was able to cause this ectopic expression even when retinoic acid was added as late as stage  <dig> and the activity was dose dependent . concentrations of ra that were able to cause ectopic expression of sftpb were the same as those that caused loss of pax <dig> expression in the thyroid suggesting that the two processes might be linked . when embryos were treated with ra at stage  <dig>  there was no ectopic expression of sftpb posterior to the cement gland  although there was also no expression of pax <dig> or foxe <dig> 

the numbers represent the number of embryos expressing the gene in the thyroid over the total number of embryos examined.

in order to determine if this simply represented ectopic expression of sftpb in the thyroid or a more global change towards lung differentiation in the thyroid, we examined expression of sftpc, another highly specific lung specific marker and found that it was also expressed in the thyroid primordium when embryos were exposed to ra . the presence of sftpb and sftpc mrna suggests either that ra causes lung differentiation markers to be expressed in the thyroid or that it causes the conversion of presumptive thyroid tissue into lung. to distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the expression of the key early transcription factors in lung and thyroid development in response to treatment with retinoic acid. as nkx <dig>  is expressed in both the early thyroid and lung, it was perhaps not surprising that there was no difference in expression of nkx <dig>  when embryos were exposed to ra or when ra signalling was blocked using the ra inhibitor at stage  <dig> . however, pax <dig> and foxe <dig>  both markers of the early thyroid are not expressed in the thyroid in ra treated embryos, although expression at other sites is not lost in the same embryos. foxe <dig> has been described as another early marker of the thyroid  <cit>  but we find that it does not have the same strong midline expression seen with other thyroid markers, although we cannot rule out low levels of expression. nevertheless, ra had no discernable effect on expression of foxe <dig> in that region although some patterning differences were noted in the pharyngeal region .

hhex is a homeobox-containing transcription factor that is first expressed in a broad domain in the anterior endoderm and expression then becomes restricted to the forming thyroid and liver  <cit> . exposure to retinoic acid during late gastrulation is known to eliminate hhex expression in the thyroid  <cit>  and we wanted to ensure that our later retinoic acid treatments would still result in loss of thyroid expression. treatment with ra at stage  <dig> was also able to eliminate the expression of hhex in the thyroid without loss of expression in the liver , further suggesting that ra blocks the full repertoire of early thyroid transcription factors. we also examined whether blocking ra signalling would change hhex expression. if ra signalling was blocked between stage  <dig> and  <dig>  there was no obvious change in hhex expression in either the liver or thyroid .

although addition of ra as late as stage  <dig> resulted in expression of sftpb in the presumptive thyroid, if the retinoic acid was added between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  there was no loss of pax <dig> and foxe <dig> expression. this suggests that the tissue becomes ambiguous, expressing transcription factors that define it as thyroid in addition to the lung differentiation markers .

the numbers represent the number of embryos expressing the gene in the organ examined over the total number of embryos examined.

one simple model for explaining differentiation of the thyroid might be that gastrulation movements position the presumptive thyroid far enough towards the rostral end of the embryo that it is not exposed to retinoic acid. if so, we would predict that simply transplanting the presumptive thyroid to the flank of the embryo, where there is robust aldh1a <dig> expression, may be sufficient to cause those precursors to differentiate as lung. this would also directly test whether endogenous levels of retinoic acid would be sufficient to cause the thyroid to lung switch. when presumptive thyroid explants were removed and cultured to stage  <dig> they did not express sftpb but robust expression of pax <dig> could be seen in the cultured explants . when explants were transplanted into the flank of a donor embryo and allowed to heal, the explants could be seen to express sftpb  suggesting that endogenous levels of ra can cause the presumptive thyroid to express sftpb. however, the transplants also continued to express pax <dig> suggesting that, similar to when ra is added between stages  <dig> and  <dig>  the tissue has not lost all thyroid characteristics . the size of the expression domain also corresponded well with the normal size of the thyroid suggesting that it was only the presumptive thyroid domain that was expressing sftpb.

discussion
ra and fgf are required for lung development in xenopus
little is known about the signalling mechanisms required for lung development in xenopus. a recent study has suggested that wnt and hedgehog signalling are needed for later lung development based on the expression patterns of shh, wnt7b, wnt5a and wif <dig> but their functional roles have yet to be elucidated. here we show that both ra  and fgf  signalling are necessary for differentiation of the lung in xenopus. both of these signalling systems are required for lung differentiation in the mouse and the two systems have been linked as loss of ra results in reduced levels of fgf <dig> and subsequent lung agenesis  <cit> . it would appear that both ra and fgf are very high in the hierarchy of lung specification as both are required well before the initial expression of nkx <dig> .

the requirement for ra signalling is lost quite early in the development of the lung. if the antagonist is added as early as stage  <dig>  well before the expression of nkx <dig> , there is still detectable expression of sftpb. if the antagonist is added at stage  <dig>  the expression of sftpb is essentially the same as control embryos. the sftpb promoter in humans has binding sites for both retinoic acid receptors and for nkx <dig>  and the two transcription factors act synergistically to drive expression of sftpb  <cit> . although we cannot make any conclusions regarding the levels of sftpb expression using whole mount in situ hybridization, our results demonstrate that the activation of the retinoic acid receptors by ra is not a requirement for sftpb expression.

the requirement for fgf also occurs early in xenopus as blocking fgf signalling at stage  <dig> causes a loss of nkx <dig>  expression, although unlike ra, the requirement is maintained later as blocking at stage  <dig> still showed a complete loss of nkx <dig>   and subsequent sftpb expression  in the lung.

requirements of ra and fgf signalling for development of the thyroid gland
when ra signalling was blocked, expression of thyroid markers was not affected . in mouse, fgf <dig>  regulated by tbx <dig> and arising from the secondary heart field, is required for normal thyroid development although loss of fgf <dig> did not eliminate the thyroid  <cit> . in zebrafish, hand <dig> is upstream of fgf <dig> and this pathway is essential for thyroid development and again it is the cardiac mesoderm that is the source of the fgf signal  <cit> . thus it is surprising that the su <dig> treatments had little effect on expression of either nkx <dig>  or foxe <dig>  although it was clear that su <dig> was able to cause developmental defects in the treated embryo, including loss of nkx <dig>  expression in the lung, severe loss of tail  and loss of sprouty <dig> expression .

we did find that the expression of pax <dig> in the thyroid was lost with early su <dig> treatments. the thyroid itself does not appear to be a direct target of the fgf signal in zebrafish  <cit> . if the potential intermediate tissue were already established before we treated with su <dig> in xenopus, this could provide an explanation for the lack of effect on nkx <dig>  and foxe <dig> expression. identification of the intermediate tissue is needed in order to test this possibility. the lack of pax <dig> expression while nkx <dig>  and foxe <dig> expression is maintained is perhaps expected. in pax <dig> knockout mice, the early thyroid primordium is maintained with normal nkx <dig>  expression although the thyroid is eventually lost at later stages due to apoptosis  <cit> . thus, eventual loss of the thyroid might eventually be expected in xenopus when fgf signalling is blocked at very early stages.

ra causes presumptive thyroid tissue to express lung-specific markers
we have observed that addition of exogenous ra results in expression of sftpb and sftpc in the thyroid , both of which are clear markers of the differentiated lung. this does not seem to be simple ectopic expression as thyroid expression of hhex, pax <dig>  and foxe <dig> are lost with the addition of ra . hhex, pax <dig>  foxe <dig>  and nkx <dig>  have been identified as forming a key transcription factor network for maintaining the thyroid  <cit>  and it appears that a similar network exists in xenopus. pax <dig> substitutes for the expression of pax <dig>  <cit>  and based on our expression data, it appears that foxe <dig> is more closely related to the central thyroid region than foxe <dig> . nevertheless, the early thyroid markers that we have examined are lost with the addition of ra suggesting that there has been a loss of the thyroid developmental program. the one exception is that expression of nkx <dig>  is maintained but it is also normally expressed in the lung. the suppression of hhex expression by exogenous ra has also been observed in the chick although in that system there was also loss of nkx <dig>  expression  <cit>  suggesting that ra is sufficient to block thyroid development but not able to cause the fate switch that we observe in xenopus. in the same chick study it was concluded that the thyroid must form in the absence or at very low levels of ra  <cit> . our results confirm this and suggest that in xenopus, the absence of ra is actually required for thyroid development, as presence of ra would result in potential differentiation as lung tissue.

we were not able to look at any differentiation markers of thyroid. although thyroid hormone has been extensively studied in terms of metamorphosis in xenopus, little is known about the ontogeny of the enzymes required for thyroid hormone production. a study examining the expression of thyroid peroxidase, type ii idothyronine deiodinase, and type iii iodothyronine deiodinase showed that none of these were expressed in the thyroid before stage  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, although initially described as thyroid gland expression, thyroid peroxidase is expressed in the lung at stage  <dig>  <cit>  further demonstrating the close relationship between these two organs. we also hoped to determine whether ra-treated thyroid progenitors would form structures reminiscent of a mature lung such as branching or alveoli. however, these are very late events in xenopus development  <cit>  and embryos treated with ra usually developed swelling around the heart that did not allow culturing to later stages.

the recent finding that sfrp <dig> and wnt <dig>  both linked to the planar cell polarity pathway  <cit> , are necessary for foregut specification suggests that morphogenetic movements of the endoderm may be important for proper specification of the different organ systems  <cit> . the requirement for morphogenesis suggests a relatively simple model whereby the early movements of the endoderm simply result in the furthest anterior endoderm, the presumptive thyroid, being beyond the mesodermal domains where retinoic acid is being synthesized. by simply physically moving the presumptive thyroid endoderm back to regions that would be predicted to have high levels of ra, the transplanted endoderm was able to express lung differentiation markers . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors, present in the posterior embryo, might also be responsible for the transition.

CONCLUSIONS
both ra and fgf signalling are required for the differentiation of the lung in xenopus embryos. ra is required for lung development before the lung primordium expresses nkx <dig>  and sftpb can still be expressed in embryos that are treated with an ra antagonist in later development. if the presumptive thyroid is exposed to ra before stage  <dig>  early thyroid transcription factors are suppressed and lung differentiation markers will be expressed in the presumptive thyroid.
