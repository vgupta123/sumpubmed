BACKGROUND
rice is staple food for more than half of the world’s population including two billion asians, who obtain 60-70% of their energy intake from rice and its derivatives. rice is globally grown on about  <dig> million hectares annually with total production of  <dig> million tons. to meet the growing demand from human population which is expected to touch  <dig> billion by  <dig>  in a changing global climatic order, rice varieties with higher yield potential and greater yield stability need to be developed  <cit> . one of the means of achieving the projected production demand is by integrating classical breeding techniques with modern biotechnological tools for rice improvement  <cit> .

most of the agronomically important traits are complex and follow quantitative inheritance. information on the number and chromosomal locations of the genetic loci influencing expression of a trait, their relative contribution to the trait expression, possible pleiotropic effects or epistatic interactions among the loci and their sensitivity to variations in environments are very important for the utilization of these loci for crop improvement. until 1980s, quantitative traits were studied in terms of population parameters estimated through various mating designs and such analyses were based on number of conditions and assumptions for statistical interpretation to understand genetics and in predicting response to selection. a key development in the field of complex trait analysis was the discovery of dna based genetic markers, physical establishment of high density genetic maps and development of qtl mapping methodologies such as single marker analysis, interval mapping, composite interval mapping and multi trait mapping  <cit> . quantitative traits are influenced by environment and tend to show varied degree of genotype by environment  interactions  <cit> . presence of significant g × e interaction has been reported by comparing qtls detected in multiple environments. the disappearance of qtls detected in one environment in another has been considered a manifestation of g × e interaction and the detection of qtls with consistent expression across environments is considered as stability indicator for the utilization of these qtls in breeding program  <cit> .

there are number of reports of mapping and introgression of qtls from wild species in rice. however, the related subspecies of oryza sativa such as japonica carry many favorable alleles which can be used for improvement of indica. it has been observed that derivatives of indica/japonica cross have higher yield vigor than either indica/indica or japonica/japonica derivatives. therefore identifying the chromosomal locations influencing yield and yield related traits in inter-sub specific derivatives is useful for rice improvement  <cit> . exploitation of inter sub specific  diversity is conceptualized as new plant type and utilized in pedigree breeding, has been suggested as a possible means for breaking genetic ceiling to yield in rice  <cit> . the present study is one of the first effort in this direction to use indica/japonica derivative for identification of qtls.

the objectives of the present study were to map novel genomic regions and qtl hotspots influencing yield and yield related traits using multi-location phenotyping data from a recombinant inbred population generated by crossing pusa <dig>  a new plant type rice genotype derived from indica × japonica cross with a highly adapted high yielding indica rice variety jaya.

RESULTS
trait performance
the mean performance of parents and minimum and maximum trait values of rils at three locations are presented in table  <dig>  higher phenotypic variation was observed for panicles per plant, grain yield per plant, per cent sterility, spikelets per panicle, filled grains per panicle, spikelet setting density, flag leaf length and flag leaf width. bi-directional transgressive segregation was observed for all traits. most of the traits were approximately normally distributed at all three locations . three traits, i.e. panicle length, panicles per plant and flag leaf width were found to be heterogeneous for error variances hence combined analyses for these traits were performed by transforming data and remaining traits were analyzed using original data. the combined analysis of variance revealed significant differences among rils for all twelve traits under study . significant effect of location was observed for all traits and block effects were significant for all traits except panicle length and spikelet setting density. significant interaction between rils and location was observed for all traits at 1% level of significance except for panicles per plant, which was significant at 5% level of significance.

*significance at 5%; **significance at 1%.

in additive main effects and multiplicative interaction effects  analyses among twelve traits, the first two components explained most of the variation  of g × e interaction effect, of which component <dig> explained more than 75% of g × e variation for days to 50% flowering, plant height and flag leaf length and for remaining traits it explained g × e in the range of  <dig> - <dig> %. component  <dig> explained the g × e interaction variation in the range of  <dig> - <dig> % for the traits under study .

correlation coefficients between yield and yield related traits
a total of  <dig> pair wise combinations were formed among twelve traits of which  <dig> coefficients of correlation estimates were found to be significant at 1% level of significance and three combinations were significant at 5% level of significance . over all the significant correlation coefficients among yield components and between yield and yield components for majority of the character pairs indicated sufficient variation in the rils population under study indicating that the ril population was appropriate for qtl mapping studies.

discussion
the prime objective of the present study was to identify novel chromosomal regions influencing yield and yield components in a ril population developed from cross pusa <dig>  a new plant type genotype, derived from indica x japonica cross and jaya, a popular indica rice variety in india. as per gramene website, a total of  <dig>  qtls were identified for yield and yield related traits through more than  <dig> qtl mapping studies in rice. many researchers have used wild species like o.nivara, o.rufipogon, o.glaberrima, and o.glumaepatula and land races to uncover the hidden genetic variation. however, linkgae drag associated with alien gene transfer is a major bottleneck in utilizing wild species in breeding programme. in the present study, which is one of the firsts of its kind, an effort was made to identify qtls for yield and its components from sub-species japonica into indica background using inter sub-specific variation generated by crossing a npt line pusa  <dig> with jaya, a widely grown indica rice variety. therefore, the present investigation is a novel attempt to utilize a new plant type based recombinant inbred mapping population to identify qtls for yield and yield related traits.

for declaring the significant association of chromosomal region with trait, thresholds levels for each trait at each location were separately computed by conducting permutation test with  <dig> permutations and used for composite interval mapping. the experimental threshold lod mean was  <dig>  at  <dig>  and lod  <dig>  at  <dig>  level of significance. a total of  <dig> qtls were detected including  <dig> qtls expressing across three environments,  <dig> qtls across two locations and  <dig> location specific qtls. out of  <dig> qtls,  <dig> stable qtls expressing across locations, were identified including at least one for each trait except yield. the phenotypic variance explained by these qtls ranged from 5% for filled grains per panicle to 53% for flag leaf width at  <dig>  level of significance showing the reliability and robustness of the qtls identified.

the extent of complex nature of the traits was evident from the observation on number of significant qtls per trait which ranged from two qtls for number of per cent sterility to  <dig> for flag leaf length. the per cent contribution of individual qtls to total phenotypic variation for respective traits ranged from  <dig> to 53% suggesting complex inheritance pattern of the traits under study. twenty significant qtls contributing >15% variation and expressing at two or more locations were detected. the new plant type parent pusa <dig> contributed  <dig> qtls  including most of the loci for spikelets per panicle, flag leaf width, per cent sterility and spikelet setting density whereas, jaya contributed  <dig> qtls  for plant height, panicle length, panicles per plant, thousand grain weight and yield per plant. this establishes the importance of variation in parental allele distribution as the critical component of qtl detection and estimation of the concerned traits. the indica x japonica diversity would have played a significant role in accumulation of number of qtl alleles in the parent pusa <dig>  distribution of yield enhancing loci among these diverse cultivated lines would also be helpful in pyramiding of qtls with relatively higher contribution to the value of trait related to yield.

lack of consistency of qtls across environments is the major hurdle for utilization of the information generated through qtl mapping experiments. in the present study twenty three qtls expressing across two locations and eleven qtls expressing across all three locations were identified. such robust qtls are important from breeding point of view.

in the present study,  <dig> out of  <dig> qtls identified were reported earlier . to understand whether genomic regions from where genes for yield related traits were cloned, are influencing yield and its components in the present study, primers were designed for  <dig> genes including sd <dig>  ebisud <dig>  ghd <dig>  hd <dig>  hd <dig>  hd <dig>  pla <dig>  d <dig>  tb <dig>  htd <dig>  moc <dig>  lax <dig>  gs <dig>  gw <dig> and ckx <dig> and used for polymorphism survey. of these, one marker from gs <dig> region was polymorphic between pusa <dig> and jaya. the marker from ghd <dig> region did not show amplification. despite the presence of sufficient variation for the traits between the two parents, most of the gene based markers did not show polymorphism indicating the possibility of novel qtls. an elaborate genotyping of ril population with additional polymorphic markers particularly from the genomic region with poor coverage would be necessary so that other additional qtls could be tapped. alternatively, the failure to detect polymorphism may be due to insufficient resolution offered by the metaphor agarose. a sequence analysis of these regions may help in developing markers, which can detect qtls in this region. the monomorphism for sd <dig> based markers indicated the presence of dwarfing allele in both parents as both parents were semi dwarf in height. for days to 50% flowering, panicles per plant, spikelets per panicle and thousand grain weight one qtl each was identified from the genomic region where hd <dig>  hd <dig>  htd <dig>  ckx <dig> and gs <dig> genes were cloned. at the genomic location of gene gs <dig>  five qtls i.e., qfll3- <dig>  qspp3- <dig>  qfgp3- <dig>  qpste3- <dig> and qtgw3- <dig> were identified of which a one major robust qtl influencing per cent sterility explained 18% of phenotypic variation across three locations can be used to understand about sterility in indica/ japonica crosses.

to identify the genomic regions influencing yield component traits across different populations, the qtls positions in the present study were compared with earlier reports and found that,  <dig> out of  <dig> qtls identified were reported earlier  <cit> . the major stable qtls like qdff8-1qppp4-2qflw4-2qspp4-1qfgp4- <dig> and qpste3- <dig> that mapped to the same genomic regions consistent across oryza sp. can be directly used for marker assisted transfer of them in to widely adopted high yielding varieties.

in the present study,  <dig> novel qtls were reported for the first time of which,  <dig> were contributed by new plant type parent pusa  <dig>  all the qtls influencing days to 50% flowering and panicles per plant shared same chromosomal regions from earlier reports indicating their possible evolutionary association in rice varieties  <cit> . five novel qtls were identified for plant height and all were contributed by jaya. a novel qtl i.e., qpht4- <dig> stable at new delhi and karnal explaining 5-6% phenotypic variation was identified. apparently, this locus would provide the needed diversity for the trait in rice breeding programs. remaining eight qtls for plant height identified in genomic regions reported earlier  <cit> .

four novel qtls were found for panicle length in the present study and all were contributed by jaya. two qtls, qpl2- <dig> and qpl3- <dig> expressing over two locations explaining 5-12% phenotypic variation would be much useful for improvement of panicle length of japonica lines. eight out of twelve qtls identified for panicle length were reported in earlier studies  <cit> . nine novel qtls were identified for flag leaf length of which five were contributed by pusa <dig>  one novel qtl qfll6- <dig> contributed by pusa <dig> expressed at new delhi and karnal explaining up to 12% phenotypic variation and can be utilized for improvement of the trait at both locations. remaining all qtls for flag leaf length and width are in the same chromosomal regions as reported earlier  <cit> . three novel qtls were identified for spikelets per panicle and one qtl qspp6- <dig> contributed by the pusa <dig> allele explaining 30% of phenotypic variation was identified at new delhi location. nine qtls for spikelets per panicle and all qtls for filled grains per panicle are reported earlier  <cit> . in the present study, qtls for spikelet sterility were identified on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> of which, qpste3- <dig> is interesting as it is located near a gene influencing grain size gs <dig>  in a recent study a qtl has been identified for percent seed set under cold water conditions at reproductive stage on chromosome  <dig> and used for identification of lines with high spikelet fertility under cold stress which may be different from the qtl identified in this study . five novel qtls were identified for thousand grain weight of which, two qtls qtgw6- <dig> and qtgw12- <dig> were stable across three locations explaining 7-25% phenotypic variation and remaining qtls were reported in earlier studies  <cit> . thousand grain weight and spikelets per panicle were two component traits of grain yield. negative correlation between these traits has been noted by rice breeders. this could be due to increase in the one of the trait and decrease in the other trait by qtls in the same chromosomal region.

the yield qtls in the present study were found to be specific to either newdelhi or aduthurai locations, explaining up to 16% of total phenotypic variation. at aduthurai qyld4- <dig> and at new delhi qyld9- <dig> explained 16% and 11% of phenotypic variation, respectively may be useful in further enhancing yield of cultivars areas adapted in these regions. of the five yield qtls identified in the present study, three qtls qyld3-1qyld4- <dig> and qyld9- <dig> shared same chromosomal regions as yield qtls reported earlier  <cit> . five novel qtls stable over two or more locations explaining 8-25% of phenotypic variation were identified for spikelet setting density. out of  <dig> novel qtls reported in the present study, twelve are stable over locations. these novel stable qtl regions are potential candidates for fine mapping and map based cloning.

we identified fifteen qtl hotspots  on eight chromosomes 1– <dig>  6– <dig> and  <dig> harboring qtls traits such as plant height, panicle length, flag leaf, spikelets per panicle, filled grains per panicle and spikelet setting density. it is very interesting to examine co-locating qtls in biological and breeding perspective while considering phenotypic and genetic correlations. one of the central concepts in genetical genomics is the existence of qtl hotspots, where a single polymorphism leads to widespread downstream changes in the expression of distant genes, which are all mapping to the same genomic locus  <cit> . in this study multiple qtl clusters affecting many traits were identified of which, some are either genetically correlated or allometrically related. it is very difficult to speculate the causative mechanism between all these traits in a hotspot as correlations do not suggest link between them. it is possible that these clusters represent more than one gene but the present mapping population resolution is not sufficient to differentiate whether it is due to either linkage or pleiotropy. it is observed that some hotspots contain qtls that are not allometrically linked. it may possible that these loci represent trans acting qtl  where the effect of alterations in regulation or structural characteristics would be expected to have smaller effects on many traits  <cit> . it can be concluded that each qtl within a qtl hotspot might only contribute a small positive effect, but co-location of multiple traits indicate that selection for beneficial allele at these loci will result in a cumulative increase in yield due to the integrative positive effect of various qtls.

in the present study,  <dig> epistatic qtls were identified for five traits with phenotypic variation ranging from  <dig> % for panicle length to  <dig> % for spikelet setting density. however, only limited number of epistatic interactions between qtls were identified firstly because analysis of primary populations like rils does not provide much information about the real nature of epistatic interactions because of the confounding effect of background loci or other qtls with larger effect interfere with detection of interactions  <cit> . secondly, in a ril population only those qtls showing additive x additive type of interaction could be identified, because identification of additive x dominance and dominance x dominance type epistatis is not possible owing to lack of heterozygosity.

the yield and its component traits showed a range of sensitivity response to changing environment. qtls of traits such as plant height, flag leaf length, grain yield per plant with high environment main effect could be detected only in one or two environments. furthermore, consistent with this observation, those genomic regions of quantitative traits with the least g x e interaction and high genotypic main effects expressed comparable phenotypes across different environments. in the present study,  <dig> qtls expressing at a specific location were identified, of which  <dig> were major qtls explaining phenotypic variance ranging from 10-30% with higher lod values . these qtls will be useful for location specific breeding like qspp6- <dig> , qdff7- <dig> , qssd8- <dig>  for new delhi, karnal and aduthurai, respectively. number of qtls  with minor effect were identified in the present study will be useful based on the fact that quantitative traits were governed by many genes of small effect. these qtls will help in improvement of yield in smaller way but in cumulative manner.

in the present study, many major qtls expressing across environments were identified. these qtls would be highly valuable for breeding the lines with wide adaptation over different locations and crop conditions throughout india. among robust qtls expressing over locations, a genomic location at marker interval rm3276-rm <dig> on chromosome  <dig> influencing  <dig> traits namely flag leaf width , spikelets per panicle , filled grains per panicle  and spikelet setting density  and two qtls i.e., qppp4- <dig> and qtgw6- <dig> will be fine mapped to identify candidate genes in future. most of the major qtls expressing over locations are flanked by markers at genetic distance of less than 10 cm will be directly be used for marker assisted transfer into the varieties for enhancement of yield through improving the component traits. pyramiding of the stable qtls identified in our study with earlier known qtls of respective traits will be undertaken which will help in raising genetic ceiling to yield.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study confirmed the presence of novel favourable alleles for yield and yield contributing traits among two subspecies i.e., indica and japonica of cultivated rice  the major robust qtls are useful for transfer to different genetic backgrounds through marker assisted backcross breeding to break genetic barriers to yield. the novel qtls identified are highly useful for fine mapping and map based cloning studies. in post genome sequencing era, the availability of complete sequence information and different marker systems for saturation of linkage map will help to understand these qtls further. considering the effect and distribution of novel yield influencing qtls among two cultivated species, further research is needed to unearth and use novel genomic regions influencing yield contributing traits to attain food security.
