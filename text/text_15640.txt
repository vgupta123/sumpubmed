BACKGROUND
aging is associated with impaired adipogenesis in various fat depots in humans  <cit> . with age and age-related osteoporosis, there is an inverse relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adiposity  <cit> . there are generally considered to be two types of adipose tissue, white and brown, both of which are able to store lipid but have different roles in energy metabolism  <cit> . moreover, there are regional differences in the function among various adipose tissue depots; in humans visceral obesity presents a greater risk for obesity-related metabolic disease than subcutaneous obesity  <cit> .

previous functional studies of marrow adipocytes have mostly been limited to developmental studies  <cit> . some studies have suggested that the presence of adipocytes can influence differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells  into adipocytes, thereby inhibiting the differentiation into other cell lines  <cit> . we and others reported that directly co-culturing bone marrow mscs with fully differentially adipocytes decreased osteoblast differentiation by decreasing runx <dig> mrna expression  <cit> , suggesting that these cells are metabolically active but negatively regulate differentiation of mscs into osteoblasts. recent studies have suggested that, in addition to adipose, liver and muscle tissue, the osteoblast is also an important target tissue for insulin action  <cit> . infiltration of fat in bone marrow could affect osteoblast function and differentiation through paracrine/endocrine effects of secretory products and adipocytokines  <cit> . thus, bone marrow adipocytes might play a pivotal role in mediating the regulation of osteoblast function in aging and in diabetic or obese animals. a recent report demonstrated that bone marrow-derived adipocytes are distinct from epididymal white adipocytes  <cit> . while it is well known that ectopic fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues is greatly associated with age-related insulin resistance and metabolic disorders  <cit> , the relationship of bone marrow adiposity with age-related diseases is unclear. in view of the specialized environment within the bone marrow with both active hematopoiesis and osteoblastogenesis ongoing, we hypothesized that adipocytes within the bone marrow might constitute a unique depot. in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of bone marrow adipocytes, we profiled the gene expression patterns in bone marrow adipocytes with age and simultaneously examined differential gene expression in bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes with age. this study is the first to characterize primary bone marrow adipocytes and to demonstrate the effects of aging on two different adipocyte populations within the same animal. our results demonstrate that while bone marrow adipocytes are distinct from epididymal white adipocytes, they also share a common inflammatory pathway in response to aging.

adipocyte-specific genes in bone marrow adipocytes
bone marrow adipocytes were isolated by flushing out bone marrow cells from femurs and tibias and then isolating the adipocytes by flotation. white adipocytes were isolated from epididymal adipose tissue by flotation following collagenase digestion. figure 2a displays the characteristics of the adipocyte cell preparations from bone marrow and epididymal depots. epididymal adipocytes tended to be larger, but both adipocyte populations stained neutral lipids with bodipy. in order to evaluate the degree of contamination of the cell preparations with monocyte/macrophages, the percentage of monocytes present in the samples was determined by identifying the number of cd11b positive cells. approximately 10-17% of cells were identified as cd11b positive in both bone marrow and epididymal white adipocyte preparations . in addition, the adipocytes from both bone marrow and epididymal depots stained with perilipin, but epididymal adipocytes had greater immunostaining. we verified the expression of a select group of adipocyte specific genes in the isolated adipocytes by rt-pcr . fabp <dig> , perilipin , adfp , leptin, adiponectin and c/ebpβ  were all much more highly expressed in bone marrow adipocytes compared to the non-floating bone marrow stromal cells, as would be expected for adipocyte specific genes . however, all of these genes, except c/ebpβ, were expressed at relatively lower levels in bone marrow compared to epididymal adipocytes. the differences in expression levels between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes determined by qrt-pcr were mostly in agreement with the microarray data obtained .

global characteristics of bone marrow adipocytes
we analyzed the differential expression of adipocyte genes isolated from bone marrow and epididymal fat depots from adult  and aged mice  using microarrays. inspection of the frequency of expression values after normalization of the data showed consistent values between all samples . principal component analysis revealed a visible separation between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes . moreover, there is a clear separation between epididymal adipocytes from 18-month and younger mice. this clustering represents the overall expression patterns, but does not provide the expression of individual genes. analysis of genes based on functional category was performed to measure the differences and the similarities between the two adipocyte populations. a total of  <dig>  of the  <dig> well-characterized mouse genes were differentially expressed between the two adipocyte populations. this selection was based on adjusted p <  <dig>  and a fold change ±  <dig> . these  <dig> genes were assigned to biologically meaningful gene ontology  categories. differences in gene expression between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes were primarily observed in three categories: biological process, molecular function and cellular component . subcategories of biological process include regulation of cell cycle, cell death and cell differentiation and regulation of metabolic processes, for instance carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, whereas molecular function includes genes associated with protein binding, enzyme activity and transcription regulator activity, and cellular component includes genes that are associated with the cell membrane, extracellular matrix, synapses and membrane bound organelles. the table displays the enrichment score and p-value in subcategories of the overall category of biological processes that are most relevant to adipocyte-specific functions, whereas the subcategories of cellular component and molecular function are not shown because the p-value of these overall categories did not reach statistical significance. as shown in table  <dig>  fat cell differentiation comprised 71-74% of genes in the ontology functional analysis. we next loaded this set of  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes into ingenuity pathway analyses for further biological functional analysis. a set of  <dig> genes was generated by filtering expression in adipose tissue. this set of genes displayed a substantial differential expression pattern between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes . table  <dig> displays the genes that were most differentially expressed and that are associated with network and biological pathways in adipocytes. of these  <dig> genes, supervised hierarchical clustering of  <dig> genes that are associated with the adipocyte phenotype revealed that all were expressed in bone marrow adipocytes and that their expression patterns differed markedly from epididymal adipocytes . in contrast to figure 3a, there appears to be a separation between 6-month-old and elder mice in expression of some of these adipose-specific genes in epididymal adipocytes in figure 3b; however, it is important to note that figure 3a represents global, not individual, gene differences.

a selection of genes generated from anova analysis was assigned to biologically meaningful gene ontology  categories using go enrichment analysis . listed are groups of gene-associated biological processes in bone marrow adipocytes compared with epididymal adipocytes . *a high value of enrichment score indicates that the functional group is over-represented in the gene list. **p value is the -log p-value of a chi-square test.

the list includes the most differentially expressed genes in bone marrow adipocytes compared to epididymal adipocytes. the set of the significantly differentially expressed genes was selected on the basis of their expression in adipose cells according to the ipa knowledge-base. for each gene, the fold change value in gene expression was calculated between mean values in bone marrow adipocytes versus epididymal adipocytes in mice . the significance of differences was measured by one-way anova. all values are p <  <dig>  except * p >  <dig> 

functional analysis of differential gene expression between bone marrow and epididymal white adipocytes
we further analyzed the over-represented  <dig> genes  by go enrichment  and ingenuity pathway analyses. among these genes, a set of  <dig> genes was decreased greater than 2-fold  in bone marrow adipocytes compared with epididymal adipocytes across age. of these  <dig> genes, there were  <dig> genes associated with bio-functional groups and networks. this set of genes was enriched and associated with lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry. figure 4a shows a supervised hierarchal cluster of genes related to adipocyte lipid metabolism, including fatty acid synthesis  and oxidation , that were 2-fold lower in bone marrow adipocytes. this gene set included leptin, acsl <dig> , adiponectin and scap  in fatty acid synthesis and pparα, pgc1α, cpt1α and acox <dig> in fatty acid oxidation. clustering also highlighted a group of  <dig> genes that were increased 2-fold or more in bone marrow adipocytes. of these  <dig> genes, there were  <dig> genes associated with biological function networks. these genes are associated with pro-apoptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial dysfunction. as listed in table  <dig>  genes displaying increased expression in bone marrow adipocytes include leptin receptor , g-protein coupled receptor 109a  and gp- <dig> cytokines, oncostatin m , interleukin  <dig>  and tnfα. adipocyte specific genes  were expressed at significantly lower levels in bone marrow adipocytes compared with epididymal adipocytes. figure 4b shows a supervised hierarchal cluster of  <dig> genes associated with decreases in transmembrane potential of mitochondria and apoptosis. these genes included p <dig>  il1β , bcl2l <dig> , ucp <dig> and tgfβ <dig>  figure 4c shows a supervised cluster of  <dig> genes associated with early adipocyte differentiation. these genes include egr <dig> , egr <dig> , klf <dig> , inhba , cebp/β and rps6ka <dig> .

age-related alteration of gene expression in bone marrow and epididymal white adipocytes
we next sought to identify genes affected by aging within each adipocyte population based on ontology. aging-related alterations of gene expression were identified and a list of genes was generated yielding a total of  <dig> genes that displayed significant changes in both bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes with age. analyses were conducted using two-way anova including interaction of cell types and age. the comparisons were conducted by comparing 14-month-old and 18-month-old to 6-month-old. genes were further analyzed by ingenuity pathway analyses to relate age-associated gene expression changes to biological function and signaling pathways. age-related gene changes in adipocytes fell into several categories of biological function including inflammatory response, genetic disorder and cellular development, whereas the majority of alterations of genes in both adipocyte depots were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid metabolism. figure 4a shows that genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were increased with age in bone marrow adipocytes, including acss <dig> , fads <dig> , and slc27a <dig> . heat maps of age-altered genes in the bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes are indicated in figure  <dig>  figure 5a illustrates age-related changes in genes involved in mitochondria function in which 18-month-old bone marrow adipocytes and epididymal adipocytes were most affected. figure 5b displays the differential expression of genes involved in lipolysis in response to aging in both adipocyte populations. tnfα, plin <dig> and lipe  increased in 14-month-old bone marrow adipocytes, whereas most of these genes decreased in 14-month-old epididymal adipocytes. pnpla <dig>  was decreased with age in both adipocyte depots. as shown in table  <dig>  pathways and networks associated with adipocyte differentiation, lipolysis and mitochondria function displayed significant changes with age in adipocytes. approximately  <dig> percent of genes associated with adipocyte differentiation were significantly up-regulated in 14-month-old bone marrow adipocytes, whereas  <dig> percent of genes were down-regulated in 14-month-old epididymal adipocytes. a similar pattern was also observed in lipolysis pathways. in addition, a group of genes associated with mitochondria function was significantly regulated in bone marrow adipocytes with age, but not in epididymal adipocytes, as indicated in table  <dig>  fold change values of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipolysis and mitochondrial function are listed in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for each gene, the fold change of expression of 14-month-old  and 18-month-old  was calculated versus 6-month-old . pathways that have significant association with the whole set of regulated genes in bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes with age were assessed using ipa software. * ratio of altered genes in bone marrow adipocytes to assigned pathway. **the p-value was calculated by ipa using fisher's exact test. a threshold of  <dig>  was selected

as indicated in table  <dig>  differential gene expression profiling was observed between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes in pathway analysis. in order to examine the differences with age between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes, we analyzed the fold changes with age in each adipocyte population separately. table  <dig> shows the top-regulated adipocyte genes in bone marrow adipocytes with age. this list indicates that adiponectin and il <dig> were the most down-regulated genes, while tnfα and genes associated with fatty acid transport and lipolysis, such as cd <dig> and lipe , were up-regulated. the increases in cd <dig> and hsl were not observed in epididymal adipocytes. on the other hand, table  <dig> indicates that lipid droplet associated proteins plin <dig> and plin <dig> were significantly increased with age in epididymal white adipocytes, whereas plin  <dig>  but not plin <dig>  was significantly altered in bone marrow adipocytes. in addition, some adipocyte-specific genes  increased in 14-month-old, then decreased in the 18-month-old group in bone marrow adipocytes, whereas they were not altered in the same direction in epididymal adipocytes .

the list includes the adipocyte genes that change with age in bone marrow adipocytes. the set of regulated genes was selected on the basis of their expression in adipose according to the ipa knowledge-base. for each gene, the fold change value in gene expression was calculated between mean values in bone marrow adipocytes from mice. the 14-month  and 18-month-old  were compared to 6-month-old. the significance of differences was measured by two-way anova.

discussion
obesity accelerates the progression of aging and age-related metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . the contribution of the heterogeneity of adipocytes to aging and age-related metabolic syndrome has been studied in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue  <cit> . adipocytes and osteoblasts originate from mscs within the bone marrow, where there is a reciprocal relationship in the development along each lineage  <cit> . during aging, increased bone marrow adipogenesis compromises hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and bone remodeling  <cit> . this study represents the first attempt to characterize primary bone marrow adipocytes by gene profiling and to compare their gene profiles with epididymal white adipocytes in response to aging. we observed a significant increase in fat infiltration in the bone marrow in 14-month-old male mice, which was accompanied by an increase in circulating insulin and a decrease in osteocalcin levels, reflecting some of the metabolic changes that occur with age.

differential gene profiling of bone marrow adipocytes
microarray analysis of gene expression by gene ontologies and functional pathways allowed us not only to identify genes differentially expressed in bone marrow adipocytes, but also genes whose expressions were significantly altered during aging. recently, majka et al performed a microarray analysis of bone marrow progenitor-derived adipocytes which were purified from peripheral adipose depots of transplanted recipient mice by flow cytometry  <cit> . their characterization showed that bone marrow progenitor-derived adipocytes are different from conventional white adipocytes with low expression levels of leptin, mitochondrial and peroxisomal capacity and high expression of inflammatory genes. the study design was different from the current study because their study examined bone marrow progenitor-derived adipocytes isolated from visceral or subcutaneous depots, whereas our study examined primary adipocytes isolated directly from bone marrow. even with this major difference in design, our results with primary bone marrow adipocytes directly isolated from the bone marrow of aging mice agree remarkably well with their results. global array analysis by pca  mapping showed a clear separation between bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes. previous studies have shown that macrophages express several genes classically associated with adipocytes, such as fabp <dig>  plin <dig> and pparγ  <cit> ; yet there are distinctions between adipocytes and macrophages. for instance, adipocytes do not express the macrophage specific cell surface marker cd11b , while macrophages do not express adiponectin  <cit> . the primary adipocytes isolated from the bone marrow in our studies are characterized by low cd11b expression and high adiponectin  expression as confirmed by quantitative pcr. expression levels of adipocyte-specific genes  were also higher in the isolated bone marrow adipocytes than bone marrow stromal cells, thus confirming that the populations of cells studied are adipocytes. cd11b staining also confirmed that there were similar degrees of contamination of adipocytes by monocyte/macrophages in preparations from bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes. in our study, adipocyte specific genes  were expressed at significantly lower levels in bone marrow adipocytes compared with epididymal white adipocytes, whereas the expression levels of inflammatory genes such as il- <dig> and tnfα were found to be higher in bone marrow adipocytes compared with epididymal white adipocytes. the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow adipocytes might be associated with a high level of macrophage infiltration within the aged bone marrow environment; however, as mentioned, we did not detect significant differences in macrophage contamination of the adipocyte preparations isolated from bone marrow versus epididymal depots. interestingly, while leptin was expressed at a relatively lower level in bone marrow adipocytes than in epididymal adipocytes, the leptin receptor  was more highly expressed in bone marrow adipocytes. in addition, expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation were lower in bone marrow compared with epididymal adipocytes, whereas genes associated with decreased mitochondrial function, such as tnfα, p <dig>  bcl2l <dig> and il-1β, were significantly higher in bone marrow compared with epididymal adipocytes. furthermore, we observed that the expression of a group of genes associated with early adipocyte differentiation, including cebp/β, klf <dig> and egr1& <dig>  inhba and s6k <dig>  were higher in bone marrow adipocytes than epididymal adipocytes  <cit> , indicating that bone marrow adipocytes are in an early stage of adipocyte differentiation. this observation also is supported by low expression of plin <dig> and relatively higher expression of plin <dig> in bone marrow adipocytes , as plin <dig> is expressed early in adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . previous studies also indicated that fat cell progenitors, preadipocytes, resemble the phenotype of macrophages. preadipocytes account for  <dig> to 50% of cells in fat tissues  <cit> . aging increases the numbers of preadipocytes and the production of cytokines pai, il- <dig> and other proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the presence of newly differentiated adipocytes and fat cell progenitor cells might contribute to the differential expression patterns observed in bone marrow adipocytes.

age-related gene changes in bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes
aging is characterized by fat redistribution with increased visceral fat and relative loss of subcutaneous fat in humans  <cit> . microarray analysis of age-related gene expression in white adipose tissue  has been reported in rodents  <cit> . linford et al reported that aging had a significant effect on gene expression in adipose tissues, particularly genes involved in pparγ-dependent adipogenesis and lipid metabolism declined with age. others have suggested that expression levels of key adipogenic transcription factors, c/ebpα, c/ebpδ and pparγ, are lower in differentiating adipocytes isolated from old compared to young rats  <cit> . here we observed a differential expression between bone marrow and epididymal white adipocytes with age. while pparγ and c/ebpβ significantly increased in 14-month-old then decreased or did not change in 18-month-old bone marrow adipocytes, pparγ increased and c/ebpβ decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> months in epididymal adipocytes. global analysis of pathways associated with adipogenesis and lipolysis showed that expressions of genes within these pathways are generally increased in 14-month-old bone marrow adipocytes, whereas they are generally decreased in epididymal adipocytes. the observation that the expression pattern of some genes appears to be most highly affected at  <dig> months is possibly related to changes in body weight and fat mass, as body weights were highest at 14-months  and declined at  <dig> months . moreover, it is possible that age might have an even greater impact on differences in gene expression patterns if older animals  were examined.

a decrease in mitochondria function is associated with aging in heart, muscle, liver and white adipocytes in animals  <cit> . a decline in mitochondria function is highly associated with an increase in inflammation and apoptosis  <cit> . linford et al reported that the most highly induced gene changes in adipose tissue and heart with aging in rats are genes associated with inflammation  <cit> . our data are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating an increase in inflammatory genes in both adipocyte populations with age, and in particular in the bone marrow, since the pathway analysis indicated that there were more genes altered with age in bone marrow adipocytes. we further examined whether the genes known to be involved in aging were altered in adipocytes. for examples, sod <dig>  and sirt <dig> , which are associated with mitochondrial aging  <cit> , were significantly decreased in epididymal adipocytes with age, whereas these changes were not seen in bone marrow adipocytes. however, overall there was generally a similar expression pattern observed in both bone marrow and epididymal adipocytes in response to aging, but age has a greater impact on global gene expression in epididymal than in bone marrow adipocytes.

potential functional implications of gene expression profile of bone marrow adipocytes
in view of the physical proximity of adipocytes and osteoblasts within the bone marrow and the inverse relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adiposity, it seems reasonable to speculate that adipocytes can directly influence bone remodeling. indeed, we have shown that adipocytes can modulate key metabolic functions of osteoblasts in co-culture through the release of secretory products . daley et al suggest that adipocyte-secreted cytokines tnfα and adiponectin inhibit hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion within the bone marrow and also affect bone remodeling  <cit> . in this regard it is noteworthy that wdnm1-like, an adipocyte-secreted protein, is expressed 3- <dig> fold higher in bone marrow adipocytes. smas et al reported that wdnm1-like is selectively expressed in adipose and liver and increases matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  activity  <cit> . it is possible that bone marrow adipocytes, through the release of wdnm1-like, might contribute to extracellular remodeling within the bone marrow and mediate cross-talk between adipocytes, mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells. in addition to wdnm1-like protein, we identified a number of genes that could potentially affect adipose-derived signaling to bone and whose expressions are increased in bone marrow adipocytes. for instance, the expression levels of oncostatin m , sfrp <dig>  abcb <dig>  tnfα, tgfβ <dig>  gpr109a and il- <dig> are markedly increased in bone marrow adipocytes. whereas the actions of cytokines, such as om, tnfα, and il- <dig>  and growth factors, such as tgfβ <dig>  on bone are well described  <cit> , sfrp <dig> is a phosphatonin that inhibits both tubular phosphate reabsorption and wnt signaling, and whose expression has been reported to increase during adipose differentiation of mscs and to be associated with lower bone density in mice  <cit> . moreover, transgenic expression of sfrp <dig> in osteoblasts results in lower bone density  <cit> . abcb <dig>  also known as multidrug resistance p-glycoprotein  <dig>  translocates phosphatidylcholine  from the inner to the outer plasma membrane, thus functioning as a pc flippase; mutations in abcb <dig> cause cholestatic liver disease  <cit> . though no specific associations of abcb <dig> with bone abnormalities are known, it is possible that adipocyte-derived pc might be supplied to and influence differentiation of mscs or osteoblasts. gpr109a is the receptor for nicotinic acid, whose endogenous ligand appears to be a product of fatty acid oxidation, β-hydroxybutyrate  <cit> . this would reduce the local release of possible pparγ or other receptor ligands or pro-ligands and potentially have a beneficial impact on bone. therefore, the gene expression profile of bone marrow adipocytes is such that it could lead to both positive and negative effects on bone. the gene expression profile observed in 14-month-old bone marrow adipocytes was accompanied by elevated circulating serum insulin, glucose, adipocytokines  and reduced osteocalcin. the regulation of osteocalcin secretion by insulin has been shown in recent studies  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the increase in adipogenesis in the bone marrow of 14-month-old mice induces a negative influence on msc lineages, thereby leading to a decline in osteoblast function, which could, in part, be attributed to hyperinsulinemia.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, comparison of gene expression profiles in bone marrow adipocytes with epididymal adipocytes indicates that bone marrow adipocytes express adipocyte-specific genes, but appear to have a gene expression pattern that distinguishes them from epididymal adipocytes. primary adipocytes within the bone marrow are characterized by low expression levels of adipocyte-specific genes and high levels of genes associated with early adipocyte lineage. however, adipocytes from both depots display common pathways and generally similar alterations in gene expression in response to aging. in depth research into the functional role of bone marrow adipocytes will be important for uncovering age related changes in bone, hematopoiesis and metabolic functions.
