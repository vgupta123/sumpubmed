BACKGROUND
alternative splicing , which generates multiple transcript variants from one gene, is a key scheme in multicellular eukaryotes to enhance the functional diversity of the proteome  <cit> . in flowering plant species, up to 61% of multiexonic genes in arabidopsis and 48% of genes in rice are affected by as  <cit> . as has been shown to regulate plant development in photosynthesis, disease resistance, floral transition, circadian rhythm, starch metabolism, auxin biosynthesis, and temperature response . as can cause alterations to protein function through modulating protein structure. for example, frame shifts caused by as often result in truncated proteins that can form nonfunctional heterodimers and act as dominant-negative regulators  <cit> . as occurrence in functional domain structures can affect protein-protein interaction, transcriptional activation or dna binding . in addition to modulate protein functions, as can influence transcript stability through nonsense-mediated decay  or mirna linked regulation  <cit> .

wood, a unique structural and storage tissue in tree species, is derived from the meristematic activities of the vascular cambium during secondary growth  <cit> . wood formation involves a coordinated progression of cell differentiation, expansion, secondary cell wall formation, and programmed cell death  <cit> . as has been found to play important roles in the process of wood formation. nac transcription factor ptrwnd1b / ptrsnd1-a <dig>  which controls secondary wall biosynthesis, was shown to undergo as in populus <cit> . the splice variant of ptrwnd1b/ptrsnd1-a2ir contains a retained intron and encodes a protein lacking dna binding and transactivation activity but retaining dimerization ability. ptrsnd1-a2ir functions as a dominant negative of ptrsnd <dig> members through heterodimerization  <cit> . this dominant negative regulation was demonstrated as a specific mechanism controlling fiber cell wall thickening during wood formation in populus <cit> . as may have evolved as a regulatory mechanism of the isochorismate synthase gene, ptiics, which encodes an enzyme for phylloquinone biosynthesis, in populus <cit> .

analyzing how as is conserved across species can help to identify as events important in general for plant development. conserved as events in several gene families such as ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase, sr protein, myb transcription factor and transthyretin-like protein have been characterized in plant species . genome-wide analysis have identified  <dig> conserved as events between arabidopsis and rice, and  <dig> conserved as events between rice and maize  <cit> . between two or more legume species,  <dig> conserved as events were detected  <cit> . more conserved as events  were reported between closely related species brassica and arabidopsis <cit> . meanwhile, it is not known how as events are conserved and involved in modulating protein function in wood formation of tree species.

recently, transcriptome of populus xylem was analyzed to identify as events in wood formation tissue. up to 36% of expressed genes were detected to undergo as  <cit> , indicating a wide influence of as in the process of wood formation. on the other hand, great variations of as events, which are likely caused by genotypic polymorphism, were observed among different populus populations  <cit> . although as has shown to influence diverse groups of genes in populus, how the as events are involved in protein function modulation is little known. in this study, we compared the occurrence of as in eucalyptus and populus and analyzed the functional implications and conservation of as during wood formation in tree species.

RESULTS
as profiles in wood formation tissues
to detect as events during wood formation, we first constructed transcriptomes of developing xylem in populus  and eucalyptus . two biological replicates were sampled from the two species for transcriptome analysis using the illumina platform based rna-seq technology  <cit> . the sequencing analysis generated approximate 30 ~  <dig> million paired-end reads  from each sample of the two species.  <dig> % ~  <dig> % of these reads could be mapped onto the reference genome via the tophat program  <cit> . more than 60% of the mapped reads located in the exon regions of the two genomes . in populus,  <dig> % of the reads were mapped to an exon-intron/intron-exon junction region, among which  <dig> % were not annotated in the reference genome. this part of reads could be from the products caused by as variants. in eucalyptus,  <dig> % of the junction reads had no annotations. some reads were found to map to intergenic regions.  <dig> % of the total reads in eucalyptus were mapped to the intergenic regions of the genome while  <dig> % of reads in populus showed such mapping. this may reflect the genome annotation difference in two species.

expressed transcripts were assembled by the cufflinks program with the cutoff of  <dig>  fpkm in both biological replicates  <cit> . considering that the weakly expressed transcripts could result in false as identification  <cit> , highly expressed transcripts with an expression level higher than 5% of the most abundant transcript were subsequently used as the basis for follow up analysis. in populus,  <dig>  highly expressed transcripts were assembled. among them,  <dig> %  of transcripts had no annotation in the reference genome . in eucalyptus, the number of highly expressed transcripts was  <dig>  and  <dig> % of them were not annotated in the genome. the assembled transcripts were transcribed from  <dig>   genes in the populus genome and  <dig>   genes in the eucalyptus genome , suggesting that a large portion of the genes in the two species are expressed in developing xylem tissue.

on the basis of the assembled transcripts, as events among the transcriptome was analyzed. the astalavista tool  <cit>  was used to establish the repertoire of as events. in total,  <dig>  as events in populus and  <dig>  events in eucalyptus were detected in developing xylem tissue . these as events affected  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the highly expressed transcripts in the two species , respectively, which were transcribed from  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the xylem expressed genes. the majority of as transcripts  displayed expression levels higher than  <dig>  fpkm . over 85% of the as events occurred in the transcript isoforms with expression ratios of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  compared to the major transcript of a same gene . for verification of the as events,  <dig> representative as events were selected for rt-pcr analysis and  <dig> of them  were confirmed , indicating the reliability of the as detection in our rna-seq analysis.figure  <dig>

the constructed as events were categorized into five major as types  <cit> : intron retention , alternative acceptor site , alternative donor site , exon skipping  and alternative position  for further analysis. ir, which encompassed  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the as events in populus and eucalyptus respectively , represented a much higher portion of as events than es. alta was over-represented and ir under-represented while the proportions of the other three as types were similar in eucalyptus compared to populus .

as features in wood formation
based on the identified as events in populus and eucalyptus, as features in woody tissues were analyzed, including at content of the introns, and nucleotide change caused by as. in populus, the average at content of the total introns of xylem expressed genes is  <dig> %, higher than  <dig> % in eucalyptus . similarly, the average at content across all alternative introns  in populus was  <dig> %, higher than that in eucalyptus  . this difference between species was also consistent in the introns among various as types. nevertheless, the nucleotide composition at splicing junction site was conserved between populus and eucalyptus .figure  <dig>

selection of different splice sites may result in a string of nucleotides changed between transcript variants. the changed nucleotides could interrupt the original reading frame if they are not multiples of  <dig> base pairs. about 67% of the as events were found to be located in the open reading frame  region of the two species. analysis of orf located as events revealed that 79% of the changed nucleotides were between  <dig> and 200 bps . a change of  <dig> nucleotides occurred most frequently in both populus and eucalyptus. similar phenomenon was reported in arabidopsis, rice and brassica <cit> . the  <dig> nucleotide change was mainly generated from alta, altd and altp, while ir or es largely caused changes of 50-150 bp . we observed 37% of the changed lengths fitting in multiples of  <dig> nucleotides in the two species, which could maintain the original reading frame. in other words, up to 63% of orf located as events  in the two species could cause frameshift. a similar frequency of orf change was observed in the as isoforms with different expression ratios .

protein domain modification caused by as
one of the major effects of as is to create protein isoforms that increase proteome diversity  <cit> . previous studies suggest that protein functions could be affected if their functional domains are interrupted by as . we conducted in silico transcript translation and then analyzed whether as occurrence caused protein domain alteration. in the two species,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the as events occurred within domain sequences which would cause domain modification . a similar frequency of such domain modification was observed in the as isoforms with different expression ratios . in detected as events,  <dig> and  <dig> kinds of domains might be modified in populus and eucalyptus, respectively. moreover,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of as events could result in domain gain or loss. among the  <dig> most frequently modified domains,  <dig> domains were present in both populus and eucalyptus, namely pkinase, pkinase_tyr, rrm_ <dig>  pp2c, zf-dhhc, ras, ndr and dnaj . to exclude the potential influence of domain number in the background genome, fisher's exact test was used to obtain the enriched domains in the as affected genes .  <dig> enriched domains showed a close association with as modification in the two species , including domains rrm_ <dig>  pp2c and ndr which were identified among the most frequently modified domains. this suggests that these protein domains may be particularly modified by as events in wood formation process.figure  <dig>

to understand how as impacts wood formation, the as modified domains from populus and eucalyptus were mapped to individual genes associated with wood formation according to their annotation . these genes could be categorized into five fundamental processes for wood formation including: cell wall formation, hormone signaling, transcriptional regulation, cellular transportation and programmed cell death . for example, cellulose synthase  and caffeoyl-coa 3-o-methyltransferase  are involved in secondary cell wall thickening during wood formation . the occurrence of as was observed in the catalytic domains of these enzymes. the functional domains of many other wood formation-related genes was also detected to be affected by as.

conservation of as-occurring genes in wood formation
to investigate conservation of as-occurring genes, putative orthologous genes in populus and eucalyptus were searched by the blast program . a total of  <dig> populus and  <dig> eucalyptus putative orthologous genes were identified with as-occurrence, which represents 28% and 44% of the as-occurring genes in the two species, respectively . gene expression patterns established via microarray analysis  <cit>  revealed that  <dig> % of these orthologous genes were highly expressed in xylem , indicating their association with wood formation. these orthologs in the two species constituted  <dig> independent gene groups with different biological functions . gene ontology  annotations suggested several important processes for plant development such as transportation, cell cycle and cell growth were significantly enriched  . genes involved in the process responding to abiotic stimulus were also enriched, highlighting the potential impact of environmental cues on as-occurring genes.figure  <dig>

conserved as events in wood formation
among orthologous genes with as occurrence, conserved introns were searched to identify conserved as events across the two species. a total of  <dig> conserved as events  were identified. these conserved as events occurred between  <dig> populus and  <dig> eucalyptus genes . among them,  <dig> events belonged to the alta type, ranking it as the most frequent type of as. approximately, 60% of the conserved as events caused frameshift and 48% of the conserved as events were detected to cause modification of functional domain structures .

two examples of the conserved as events in the two species were further analyzed in greater detail. as was observed in an orthologous pair of ap <dig> genes in populus and eucalyptus . the ap2/erebp family encodes transcription factors that play a role in a variety of plant regulatory processes  <cit> . the ap <dig> domain of this gene family consists of  <dig> amino acids that are responsible for dna binding. in populus, one isoform of the ptap <dig> transcript has two ap <dig> domains while the second isoform only has one ap <dig> domain due to a skipped exon. the conserved as event was also observed in eucalyptus. another example of conserved as event occurred in the functional domain of aux/iaa gene family, which encode short-lived nuclear proteins that negatively regulate auxin signaling transduction  <cit> . aux/iaa proteins are likely involved in the early response to auxin signaling, which controls the development of wood-forming tissues  <cit> . based on our analysis, a conserved intron is retained in the iaa <dig> genes of populus and eucalyptus. importantly, the conserved ir event resulted in a truncated protein as it introduced a premature termination codon in the transcript . rt-pcr verified the two cases of conserved as events in the two species .figure  <dig>

to study how as can regulate the function of the aux/iaa family, sequences of iaa <dig> orthologs from arabidopsis, rice, populus and eucalyptus were aligned. multiple sequence alignment showed the truncated proteins, ptiaa8ir and egiaa8ir, specifically lack the conserved subdomain iv of aux/iaa proteins, but contain intact subdomains i ~ iii . subdomain iv contains a sequence which is critical for nucleus localization  <cit> . to examine whether the location of the protein is affected by as, iaa <dig> isoforms from populus were fused with gfp for localization analysis. when expressed in tobacco leaves, the protein encoded by full transcript ptiaa <dig> was shown to locate in the nucleus, while the truncated protein ptiaa8ir displayed ubiquitous location in cells . this indicates as can modulate protein functions of aux/iaas through regulating their intercellular location.figure  <dig>

discussion
landscape of as in wood formation of tree species
this study established a comprehensive profile of as events during wood formation. the results show that in both populus and eucalyptus more than 20% of the highly expressed transcripts were affected by as, indicating extensive influence of as on wood formation. in populus,  <dig>  as events were detected while  <dig>  events were detected in eucalyptus. based on current information, however, it is unknown whether this difference is implicated by the characteristics of the species. five as types were detected but their composition ratio was different in the two species. alta was more frequently in eucalyptus while ir was observed with a relatively greater frequency in populus. interestingly, intron sequences in eucalyptus have a significantly lower at content compared to those in populus. variations of at content may be responsible for the different as profiles in the two species, as ua-richness of plant introns is important for splicing efficiency  <cit> . as identification in the developing xylem of populus trichocarpa has recently reported  <cit> . about 7 ~ 11% of the total annotated genes were found to undergo as in  <dig> populus individuals from different populations, while around 46% of the as events were not conserved within individuals, which may be caused by genotypic variations  <cit> . in the present study, the occurrence of as was detected in about 10% of the total annotated genes and about 40% of the as-occurring genes were the same in the reported individuals   <cit> , indicating a consistency of as occurrence in different populus species. the results may also reflect some of the detected as events being specific to the gene type of hybrid poplars .

functional implications of as in wood formation
as occurs extensively in various plant species, however, comprehensive analysis of their functional impact has been little studied. as affect protein functions in a variety of ways by altering amino acid composition, subcellular location, secondary structure stability, binding property, and posttranslational modification  <cit> . the diversified aspects of as influence can be assessed through in silico analysis. in this study, we primarily focused on analysis of as-occurring genes which bring about modification of domain structures. results show that about 42% of the as events caused orf disruptions or change, suggesting that as extensively affects protein sequence. a large proportion  of as events resulted in protein domain modifications, which may be involved in wood formation at various levels. for example, the protein domains modified included cellulose_synt, glyco_transf and glyco_hydro, which function in cell wall biosynthesis. protein domains like proteasome and peptidase are involved in programmed cell death. as modification to the aux/iaa and pp2c domains indicates that as may play a role in auxin and aba signaling in wood formation tissue. we also observed a similar pattern of orf change or domain modification in the as events with different isoform ratios.

apart from generating functionally tailored proteins, as could also affect mrna transport, localization and stability prior to protein translation. for example, some intron-containing transcript variants could remain within the nucleus resulting in decreased mobility  <cit> . this indicates a subset of as transcripts which cannot be translated into proteins as in silico predictions would suggest. in addition, aberrant transcripts caused by as are often degraded by rna surveillance pathways such as nonsense-mediated decay   <cit> . in theory, nmd sensitive transcripts would generally display low expression levels. a group of such as events might be excluded from this study as weakly expressed transcripts were filtered out in analysis. thus, a normalized cdna library should be constructed in order to estimate nmd targets during wood formation  <cit> . intriguingly, typical nmd targets in arabidopsis include mrna with a 3'utr sequence longer than 350 bp . our analysis suggests that the average length of 3'utr in both populus and eucalyptus is over 400 bp. and 3'utr sequences are usually longer than 700 bp when they contained as events. this may suggest a difference between arabidopsis and tree species in the precise length of 3'utr that could trigger nmd pathway. taken together, our results indicate that the as events may function in regulating wood formation through modifying protein domain structures.

conservation of as in populusand eucalyptus
by comparing as profiles in populus and eucalyptus, this study provides a sketch of as events conserved in wood formation tissue. in our results, as occurred within  <dig> populus and  <dig> eucalyptus putative orthologous genes. go analysis revealed that the orthologous genes were featured with functions related to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. over half of the orthologous genes were preferentially expressed in the developing xylem of populus, indicating their involvement in wood formation.

comparison of as events identified  <dig> as events that were conserved in populus and eucalyptus. among them,  <dig> % of the conserved as events caused domain modifications. for instance, a conserved ir event was demonstrated to affect subdomain iv of aux/iaa isoforms, which is critical to regulate protein subcellular location. the intron-retained aux/iaa isoforms contain a premature termination codon and have a long 3’utr sequence , suggesting they may be regulated by the nmd pathway that is coupled with as occurrence. consistent with this, these transcripts displayed reduced expression level according to rt-pcr. interestingly, no equivalent as regulation has been reported for aux/iaa family genes in other plant species such as arabidopsis and rice. whether this as event regulation of aux/iaa family genes is specific to wood formation is yet to be further characterized.

CONCLUSIONS
as plays a critical role in the development of multicellular organisms, though much remains to be learned about its function in tree-specific processes. as is extensively involved in wood formation as revealed by profiles of as-occurring genes, as events and as modification of protein structures in the developing xylem of populus and eucalyptus. the results of this study highlight a number of new avenues to explore how as is employed as a mechanism to modulate gene functions in wood-forming tissues.
