BACKGROUND
the use of saccharum sp. to produce second generation  ethanol can reduce waste and increase the yield without expanding the crop area, contributing to a cleaner, more efficient and more sustainable production. however, from the economic point of view, the costs of the process need to be reduced, mostly those related to the enzymes used to deconstruct plant cell walls. therewith, research is mainly focused on the identification of new enzymes that could efficiently degrade cell walls  <cit> . other studies have been developed from the biomass perspective, describing the plant cell wall components , and even altering them attempting to achieve a higher ethanol 2g yield. since pre-treatments facilitate cell wall digestibility to increase ethanol production, when altering plant cell wall components, focus should be either on lignin- carbohydrate complex cleavage and hemicellulose removal, or lignin modification and even on redistribution and cellulose decrystallization  <cit> .

plant cell walls are mainly composed of polysaccharides and cell wall proteins   <cit> . proteomics studies have revealed the large diversity of cwps . they have been grouped in different functional classes according to predicted functional domains and experimental data: polysaccharide modifying proteins, oxido-reductases and proteases, have been found as major classes. structural proteins such as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, namely extensins, arabinogalactan proteins and hydroxyproline/proline-rich proteins, have been estimated to account for about 10 % of the cell wall mass in dicots  <cit>  and approximately 1 % in monocots  <cit> . however, only a few of them have been identified in proteomics studies. cwps are involved in growth and development, signaling and defense against pathogens. they virtually take part in most functions of the cells  <cit> . they can affect cell fate, being able to sense stress signals and transmitting them to the cell interior  <cit> . they can also have tissue-specific functions , such as playing roles in cuticle formation  <cit> . due to this versatility, plant cell walls are the subject of many fields of research.

in the case of grasses, type ii-cell walls present specific features  <cit> . the cellulose microfibrils are interlocked by glucuronoarabinoxylans, instead of xyloglucans of type i-cell walls. in addition, the grass cell walls contain a substantial portion of non-cellulosic polymers ‘wired on’ the microfibrils by alkali-resistant phenolic linkages.

as mentioned above, plant cell walls contain enzymes capable of modifying the cell wall matrix  <cit> : endoglucanases which cleave the polysaccharide backbones; glycosidases which remove side chains; transglycosylases which cut the polysaccharides and link them together; esterases which remove methyl groups of pectins, and cleave ester bonds in polysaccharide chains; and class iii peroxidases  which form or break phenolic bonds. altogether, these enzymes offer many possibilities to modify the structure and the mechanical properties of cell walls, and thus biomass structure  <cit> . besides, the addition of plant glycosidases during the hydrolysis of corn stover could increase the ethanol yield  <cit> . these examples show that the repertoire of cwps could provide interesting tools to improve the deconstruction of cell walls.

as commonly known, classical cwps share common features. the first one is a signal peptide at the n-terminus of the protein which is responsible for their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> , the first organelle of the secretory pathway  <cit> . the signal peptide is not formed by a consensus amino acid sequence. however, it has a positively charged n-region at its n-terminus and a central hydrophobic h-region followed by a polar c-region at its c-terminus comprising the cleavage site  <cit> . in addition, cwps do not possess the canonical er retention signal kdel or hdel tetrapeptide at their c-terminus  <cit> . the third feature is that they do not present a trans-membrane domain. when passing through the secretory pathway, proteins go from er to the golgi complex in order to be packed into vesicles and directed to be secreted. plasma membrane proteins show the same features as cwps except that they have a trans-membrane domain  <cit> .

cell wall proteomics require challenging strategies comprising several steps, from the extraction to the identification of the proteins, compared to other sub-cellular proteomics works. despite the technical hurdles, a lot of studies have been successful  <cit> . several aerial organs have been studied in different plant species, such as alfalfa  <cit> , linum usitatissimum  <cit> , solanum tuberosum  <cit> , and arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . in brachypodium distachyon leaves and stems, different classes of proteins have been identified and it was possible to address some of them to the mechanism of 2g biofuel production  <cit> . it is then possible to alter their expression to improve cell walls deconstruction, such as the upregulation of a cell wall transcript in rice  <cit> .

in a recent publication,  <dig> cwps have been described from isolated cells obtained from cell suspension cultures of sugarcane  <cit> . however, the description of the cell wall proteome from a differentiated organ is still missing. in this work, two different strategies were developed to extract the cwps of two month-old stems: either a destructive method  or a non-destructive one , i.e. vacuum infiltration  <cit> . proteins were identified by mass spectrometry  and bioinformatics. the results were compared regarding the number and the type of cwps. quantitative ms data were used to identify the most abundant cwps in sugarcane culms.

RESULTS
extraction of proteins from cell walls
two-month-old sugarcane culms were selected for presenting a soft and young material, at an early stage of development. the use of young organs could lead to the identification of proteins involved in cell wall expansion, thus clarifying the mechanisms that the plant itself uses to allow growth.

sugarcane features four stages of development:  germination and emergence,  tillering phase,  grand growth period and  ripening phase, when sugar accumulates  <cit> . the tillering phase begins about 40 days after planting and can last up to 120 days, being the early stage of plant development  <cit> . in this work, plants were collected 60 days after planting, halfway from the maximum tillering, measuring around 40–50 cm in height from the bottom to the upper leaf. this age was also chosen to allow distinguishing leaves and culms visually.

the dt method was a destructive one relying on the grinding of the material and its centrifugation in solutions of increasing sucrose concentration. on the contrary, the nd method was a non-destructive one, since it maintained the cell structures intact while performing the extraction of cwps by vacuum infiltration of the tissues. thus, it was expected that the dt method would be able to extract more wall-bound proteins than the nd one. in both protocols, protein extraction from cell walls was performed using  <dig>  m cacl <dig> and 2 m licl. the efficiency of cacl <dig> to release cwps could rely on the fact that demethylesterified homogalacturonans strongly chelate calcium  <cit> , solubilizing weakly-bound proteins by a competition mechanism  <cit> . on the other hand, licl was used to extract mostly hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins  <cit>  all the experiments were performed in duplicates.

the dt method produced around 518 μg of proteins from 35 g of culms . regarding the nd method, the yield was slightly lower: around 667 μg of proteins were recovered from about 50 g of culms . figure  <dig> shows the patterns of the proteins extracted from sugarcane culms. the presence of thin resolved bands after staining showed the quality of the procedure with no degradation pattern. each biological replicate, using either method, showed a pattern very similar to that of its counterpart and each method gave rise to a different pattern.fig.  <dig> 1d-electrophoresis of proteins extracted form 2-month-old sugarcane culm cell walls. proteins have been extracted using either the dt or the nd method. the biological repeats corresponding to each methods are respectively numbered 1– <dig> and 3– <dig>  the molecular mass markers  are indicated in kda on the left



identification of proteins by mse and bioinformatics analyses
proteins were analyzed by shotgun lc-ms/ms, after tryptic digestion. the identification of proteins was performed using the translated-sucest database containing ests  <cit> . homologous genes in sorghum bicolor, the closest related species with a fully sequenced genome, were systematically searched for. predictions of sub-cellular localization and functional domains were done on translated ests when they were full-length, otherwise on homologous s. bicolor coding sequences. because of the high level of ploidy of the sugarcane genome  <cit> , in some cases, different ests matched the same s. bicolor gene.

more detailed results of ms analyses, such as protein score and number of matched peptides, can be found in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  about 65 % and 82 % of the proteins identified were found in both biological replicates, in the dt and nd methods, respectively. these methods allowed the identification of  <dig> and  <dig> different proteins from the translated-sucest database, respectively. from these,  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins respectively had a predicted signal peptide, no known intracellular retention signal such as an endoplasmic retention signal and one trans-membrane domain at most . these proteins were considered as cwps , and the others as intracellular proteins . the dt and nd methods lead to the identification of different sets of proteins.table  <dig> cwps identified in sugarcane young culms

bsemicolons separate data from different biological repeats. dashes separate data from different extraction methods 



altogether,  <dig> different cwps were identified and distributed into eight functional classes : proteins acting on carbohydrates, proteins possibly related to lipid metabolism; proteins with interaction domains; oxido-reductases; proteases; miscellaneous proteins; signaling and proteins of unknown function. from these  <dig> cwps,  <dig>  were identified using both the dt and nd methods. it should be noted that no structural protein was identified. besides,  <dig> cwps  were previously identified in the cell wall proteome of sugarcane cell suspension cultures  <cit> . consequently,  <dig> sugarcane cwps were newly identified in this study.fig.  <dig> distribution of cwps identified in 2-month-old sugarcane culms. proteins were distributed in functional classes according to bioinformatics predictions: pac stands for proteins acting on carbohydrates; or, for oxido-reductases; lm, for proteins possibly involved in lipid metabolism; p, for proteases; id, for proteins with interaction domains ; s, for proteins possibly involved in signaling; m, for miscellaneous; uf, for unknown function



regarding the dt method, the oxido-reductases , mainly peroxidases  and two blue copper binding proteins, constituted the most represented class, followed by proteins related to lipid metabolism , all being lipid transfer proteins . asp proteases  and miscellaneous proteins , comprising thaumatin, germins and dirigent protein, were also identified . surprisingly, only one glycoside hydrolase  of the gh <dig> family, as well as a single pectin methylesterase  were identified from the proteins acting on carbohydrates class . proteins with interaction domains  were represented by one serine protease inhibitor. proteins of yet unknown function  were numerous and it was possible to highlight the presence of proteins with duf <dig> domains, already found in other cell wall proteomes  <cit> , and proteins homologous to phloem filament protein  <dig> 

the most represented functional class using the nd method was that of proteins acting on carbohydrates , mostly ghs  and two carbohydrate esterases. proteins related to lipid metabolism  comprised ltps and one gdsl-lipase. oxido-reductases  were mostly prxs. miscellaneous proteins  were mainly represented by thaumatins and germins. proteases  were asp, ser or cys proteases. proteins with interaction domains were represented by one ser protease inhibitor and signaling proteins by one leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase. finally, proteins of unknown function comprised proteins with duf <dig> and duf <dig> domains.

we have also performed a quantitative analysis of the cwps identified by both methods . only the proteins present in amounts higher than  <dig> femtomoles, calculated by averaging the results of the two biological repeats, have been listed in table  <dig>  when a protein has been identified using both methods, its quantification could be the same or different if either of the two methods could extract it more efficiently. these differences could,  result from the loss of proteins during the washings steps required to purify cell walls using the dt method or,  due to different types of interactions with cell wall components. among the proteins present in high amount in culm cell walls, ltps are well represented with  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins. one gh <dig>  three asp proteases and two duf <dig> proteins were also found in the top <dig> list.table  <dig> most abundant cwps in the cell wall proteome of sugarcane young stems. proteins with average amounts between the two biological repeats higher than  <dig> femtomols using either method are listed 


athe relative amount of proteins quantified using either method is indicated 



two approaches were used to statistical analysis: a multivariate analysis, the scores plot and vip scores , and a univariate one, the volcano plot, as shown in fig. 3a. in fig. 3a, three proteins could be considered as those contributing the most to the distinction between the dt and nd methods. figure 3b indicates that the dt and nd methods differ statistically from each other, since it is possible to separate two distinct groups of proteins regarding the quantity of proteins extracted in each technique. in addition, the two first components  contributed positively to the model , and the variation of the proteins was  <dig>  % . values of q2 >  <dig>  indicates that a model is better than chance, and scores of  <dig>  or higher, demonstrate a very robust trend or separation  <cit> . the protein scccrz3002g <dig> of unknown function was the one that contributed the most to the separation of the groups, being found in higher amount using the nd method . the scccam2002f <dig> and sceplb1044h <dig> ltps, in turn, were the third and the fourth proteins that contributed to the separation of the two groups in partial-least squares discriminant analysis - pls-da <dig>  being found in higher amount in the nd and dt methods, respectively.fig.  <dig>

as presented in fig. 3c, using the average of the quantitative data obtained for each method, the statistical analysis showed that from the  <dig> proteins that most contributed to distinguish the dt and nd methods, nine of them showed a much higher amount using the nd method. additional file  <dig> shows important features identified by volcano plot.

comparison of the cwps of sugarcane young culms to those of stems of other plants
previous cell wall proteomics studies were performed on b. distachyon basal and apical internodes  <cit> , medicago sativa basal and apical stems  <cit>  and linum usitatissimum young stems  <cit> . all these data have been collected in the wallprotdb database  <cit>  and annotated in the same way, thus allowing comparisons  <cit> . these cwps were compared to the newly identified cwps of sugarcane stems . in b. distachyon, a protocol very similar to the dt method was used, but the lc-ms/ms analysis were done with 1-d gel pieces  <cit> . l. usitatissimum stem cwps were extracted using a protocol similar to the dt method and 1-d gel pieces corresponding to stained protein bands were used as starting material for ft-icr ms analysis  <cit> . on the other hand, in alfalfa stems, egta tretament and licl were used for protein extraction, and 1-d gel pieces were digested prior to analysis using a nanoacquity uplc system  <cit> . although different strategies for protein extraction and ms analyses have been used, all the protocols used the same salts to extract proteins from cell walls: cacl <dig> and/or licl.fig.  <dig> comparison of the percentage of proteins identified. cwps present in this study were compared with known cell wall proteomes of stems from different species: b. distachyon  <cit> , l. usitatissimum  <cit> , and m. sativa  <cit> . proteins were distributed in functional classes – according to the legend of fig. 2




the stem cell wall proteomes of all the above species showed very similar percentages of proteins acting on carbohydrates. an outstanding observation was that sugarcane had a much higher percentage of proteins related to lipid metabolism  than all the other species . the dicot m. sativa presented a much higher proportion of proteins with interaction domains in comparison with the monocots . the monocots showed a higher proportion of oxido-reductases in comparison with the dicots . a much smaller proportion of proteases was found in l. usitatissimum stems  <cit> .

discussion
in this work,  <dig> different sugarcane cwps were identified in young culms using two different strategies. together with the cell wall proteome of cell suspension cultures  <cit> ,  <dig> different cwps of sugarcane have been identified. in this study alone,  <dig> cwps were newly identified and  <dig> cwps were identified in both culms and cell suspension cultures, among which  <dig> prxs. besides, the proportion of proteins predicted to be intracellular in culm extracts  was lower than in sugarcane cell suspension culture extracts   <cit> , being quite the same as in b. distachyon young internodes  <cit> . this is probably inherent to the type of material, since a lot of cell debris are present in the culture medium  <cit> .

interestingly, the proportion of intracellular proteins was higher in leaves than in stems in b. distachyon  <cit> ; the same case has been observed for sugarcane . the nd method has lead to the identification of about 75 % more cwps than the dt method , and around 81 % of the cwps  have been identified using one method of extraction only. these results show the importance of using different strategies to enlarge the coverage of a cell wall proteome. the nd method has allowed the recovery of more cwps of sugarcane culms, and much more ghs than the dt method. if the objective of the study is to get an overview of cwps or of glycosidases, this strategy should be considered. in addition, if the goal is especifically to recover ghs, perhaps a total protein extraction followed by affinity chromatography on concanavalin a is the best option  <cit> . however, if the aim is to go deeper into prxs, the dt method looks more appropriate. besides, both methods showed a good reproducibility since between 65 % and 82 % of cwps were identified in both biological replicates. although rarely discussed in cell wall proteomics paper, this result is consistent with those of previous studies  <cit> .

the nd method could recover both a higher number of cwps and a higher amount of those contributing to the discrimination between the two methods through the statistical analysis. additionally, the three proteins highlighted in the univariate analysis were also present in the multivariate analysis, being numbers  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> from the  <dig> cwps considered to be the most important for the discrimination between the two methods. the major difference between the two nd and dt methods regards proteins acting on carbohydrates: only one cwp has been identified using the dt method whereas one fourth of the cwps belongs to this class using the nd method. since the same organs were analyzed, this difference has to be related to the strategy used for protein extraction. some proteins could have been lost during the washing steps required to clean cell wall fragments in the case of the dt method  <cit> . this could explain why more cwps were found using the nd method. however, the use of the dt method with sugarcane cell suspension cultures allowed the recovery of several ghs  <cit> . then, the low number of gh identified in this study using the dt method could be related to the structure of the sugarcane culm cell walls. in the case of grasses, cell walls contain different matrix polysaccharides and protein components, when compared to dicot cell walls. as an example, grass cell walls present cellulose microfibrils interlocked by glucuronoarabinoxylans instead of xyloglucans. in addition, they contain a substantial proportion of non-cellulosic polymers wired on cellulose microfibrils by alkali-resistant phenolic linkages  <cit> .

as found with the nd method, most previous cell wall proteomics studies showed that proteins acting on carbohydrates were the most represented  <cit> . the role of such proteins in cell walls points to the rearrangements of polysaccharides during development . these modifications can occur through the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds within polysaccharides or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety  <cit> . not surprisingly, they can play important roles during germination  <cit> , defense against herbivory  <cit> , lignification  <cit>  and regulation of phytohormones  <cit> . in this functional class, all but two were ghs, represented by one acyl-esterase and one pme. gh <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also found as the major gh families present in the cell wall proteomes of b. distachyon, oryza sativa and a. thaliana  <cit> . one member of the a. thaliana gh <dig> family has been shown to degrade β-mannosides, suggesting that it could hydrolyze mannans, galactomannans, or glucogalactomannans in muro  <cit> . proteins of the gh <dig> family could have α-l-arabinofuranosidase and/or β-xylosidase activities  <cit> . one gh <dig> is among the most abundant cwps identified in sugarcane culms. gh <dig> and gh <dig> were also identified in termite stomach, being characterized as β-glucosidases, i.e. cellulases that preferentially hydrolyze β-1- <dig> glycosidic linkages  <cit> . however, the overexpression of a rice β-glucosidase and an endo-glucanase was null and led to deleterious effects, respectively  <cit> . this may indicate that perhaps these enzymes should not be altered if the goal is to achieve a less recalcitrant plant. however, by altering the expression of exo-glucanases, it was possible to increase saccharification in rice, besides negative effects on plant development  <cit> . in b. distachyon culms, no gh <dig> was identified and a higher proportion of gh <dig> and  <dig> were found in comparison to gh <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , an opposite finding to sugarcane culms. another cwp-to-watch is the pme, since the expression of a fungal pectin methylesterase inhibitor  in wheat and arabidopsis could increase the efficiency of enzymatic saccharification  <cit> .

the proportion of oxido-reductases was almost the same as that found in the cell wall proteome of sugarcane cell suspension cultures  <cit> . in b. distachyon culms, the percentage of oxido-reductases was closer to that found using the nd method  <cit> , although the work was performed with a protocol very similar to the dt method. so it is not possible to conclude that the method itself was more likely to extract these proteins. as found in b. distachyon  <cit> , prxs and blue copper binding proteins were more numerous in the sugarcane than in the a. thaliana cell wall proteome. different populations of prxs were extracted by the nd and dt methods. this could be related to their different abilities to interact with pectins as shown for a zucchini and an a. thaliana prxs  <cit> . although prxs are numerous  in the sugarcane culm cell wall proteome, none of them was found amongst the most abundant cwps. prxs are well-known cell wall enzymes, identified in many cell wall proteomics studies  <cit> . they could be involved in cell wall polysaccharide rearrangements during development, defense reactions or signaling  <cit> . their activity is versatile. during the hydroxylic cycle, prxs can produce ros that break cell wall polysaccharides in a non-enzymatic way, promoting wall extension, whereas during the peroxidative cycle, prxs can favor cross-linking of cell wall components such as structural proteins or lignins  <cit> . so, prxs are also a class of proteins to be watched when searching for proteins that could potentially facilitate the production of cellulosic ethanol. the blue copper binding proteins have already been found in cell wall proteomes  <cit> . they have been associated to redox processes such as electron transfer proteins with small molecular mass compounds  <cit> . blue copper binding proteins were not found in the cell wall proteome of sugarcane cell suspension culture  <cit> .

ltps were already identified in many cell wall proteomes  <cit> . they have been assumed to bind hydrophobic molecules in cell walls which could be essential for cell wall loosening, thus facilitating wall extension  <cit> . ltps could also be involved in cuticle formation  <cit> . since sugarcane culms have a thick cuticle, this could explain the high number of identified ltps in their cell wall proteome. this number is much higher than in any other species studied before  <cit> . this explanation is consistent with the fact that a much lower number of lipid-related proteins was found in sugarcane cell suspension cultures which are undifferentiated cells  <cit> . ltps are also the family that embraced the highest number of proteins with an average quantity higher than  <dig> femtomoles . additionally, five ltps were among the  <dig> proteins who contributed the most to the discrimination between the nd and dt methods.

proteases can participate in various processes of the plant life cycle, such as development, defense, stress response and adaptation to the environment  <cit> . in sugarcane culms, mostly asp proteases have been identified. asp proteases were also numerous in the b. distachyon cell wall proteome  <cit> . three asp protease were found among the  <dig> most abundant cwps of the sugarcane culm cell wall proteome. asp proteases may be linked to disease resistance signaling, being accumulated in the extracellular matrix under pathogen attack  <cit> . besides, two ser proteases of the subtilisin family were identified. proteins of this family have been shown to display various functions in plant development and signaling  <cit> . finally, one cys protease was identified, a type of protease that can be related to the regulation of senescence and seed germination, as well as to defense roles  <cit> . cys proteases are known to be secreted in the apoplast  <cit> . it should be noted that ser and cys proteases were only found using the nd method.

several thaumatins have been identified, mainly using the nd method. thaumatins are pathogenesis-related proteins. several of them have been shown to be β- <dig> -glucanases showing anti-fungal activity  <cit> . however, one thaumatin has been shown to exhibit a polyphenol oxidase activity  <cit> . finally, some proteins of unknown function were found, especially members of the duf <dig> and duf <dig> families. duf <dig> proteins present a conserved region found in a number of plant proteins  <cit> , and have been identified in all the cell wall proteomes studied so far  <cit> . one a. thaliana duf <dig> protein has been shown to interact with cellulose in vitro  <cit> . in sugarcane culms, two duf <dig> proteins were among the most abundant proteins. thus, these proteins probably take part in important processes in the cell wall. on the other hand, one duf <dig> is known as an auxin-responsive protein, air <dig>  that may interact with other redox partners within the plasma membrane to constitute a redox link between the cytoplasm and the apoplast  <cit> .

some protein families were under-represented in the cell wall proteome of sugarcane culms when compared to other cell wall proteomes. only one protease inhibitor has been identified. it belonged to the bowman-birk family. it has been characterized as a trypsin inhibitor associated with the regulation of endogenous seed proteinases, storage of sulfur amino acids and defense against insects and pathogens  <cit> . in sugarcane cell suspension cultures, different families of proteins with interaction domains have been identified, and in b.distachyon, proteins of the bowman-birk family were found both in leaves and internodes  <cit> . regarding proteins possibly involved in signaling, the lrr receptor kinase family was commonly found in other cell wall proteomics studies  <cit> . such proteins probably play roles in signal perception during development or in response to environmental cues  <cit> . one dirigent protein has been identified in sugarcane culms. such proteins have been assumed to play a role in lignification through the control of monolignol coupling affecting wall flexibility and its mechanical strength  <cit> . members of this family have been identified in b. distachyon stems  <cit> . no structural protein has been found in the sugarcane cell wall proteome, as in previous studies  <cit> . this is probably because these proteins are difficult to extract when they are covalently cross-linked  <cit> . usually, they cannot be extracted by salts  <cit> , thus, different strategies should be used if structural proteins, such as extensins, are the focus  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work has contributed to three main aspects:  characterize cwps from sugarcane young stems,  compare the cwps found, regarding type and amount, using two different methods of extraction and  point at candidate cwps to be used in future research to enhance 2g ethanol production. this study also offered a glimpse to the quantification of cwps, providing help for the decision of which method is more suitable for the efficient extraction of different types of cwps from sugarcane culms. if the focus is on ghs or getting an overview of the cell wall proteome, then the nd method could be used. otherwise, if looking for prxs, the dt method is the more adequate. our results highlight the importance of using different strategies to isolate cwps.

future studies that could explain how these proteins interact with cell wall components, and use these ghs to obtain a custom-made plant to enhance 2g ethanol production will bring new perspectives to an old problem: the viability of this biofuel. in addition to ghs, attention should be paid to other proteins such as prxs and dirigent proteins, since prxs can favor cross-linking of the cell wall components such as proteins or lignins  <cit> . therefore, they could be used in genetic engineering since lignin is a cell wall barrier preventing the access of cellulose to enzyme attack in order to break these sugars into fermentable ones  <cit> . lowering the lignin content or modifying lignin linkages to facilitate its removal are two possible ways to enhance the efficiency of biomass deconstruction  <cit> . finally, some proteins of yet unknown function could be interesting candidates.
