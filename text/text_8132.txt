BACKGROUND
the worldwide occurrence cap is increasing and it has now overtaken lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men in the western world. in spite of significant progress in its clinical management, comparatively little is known about the aetiology of the disease and predicting outcome is still a challenge for most clinicians. histopathologically, cap displays considerable heterogeneity and can contain a substantial admixture of pre-malignant hpin glands within cancerous foci. hpin is currently considered to be the most likely precursor to invasive cap  <cit> . however, most of these foci are latent and rarely develop into clinically detectable cancer. unfortunately, a significant number  do progress and can become aggressive and lethal  <cit> . the major difficulty facing clinicians is the identification of patients presenting with early stage cap, who are likely to develop life-threatening disease. as a result, intensive research is currently underway to identify the key alterations that may prove to be important for both classification and prognosis prediction.

the advent and development of cgh, which started in the early 1990's  <cit> , has revolutionised cytogenetics and allowed for genome-wide screening of numerous cancer types and the identification of genomic cna, which may contribute to cancer development and progression. the accumulation of genetic changes that occurs during the stepwise evolution from normal tissue to metastasis, although likely due to increased genetic instability, may indicate the chromosomal locations of tsg or oncogenes that are important in tumourigenesis. when first introduced, cgh used metaphase chromosomes targets to identify cnas. however, recent advances have substituted these with arrayed dna sequences that provide higher resolution,  <dig> mb versus  <dig> mb, and greater ease of analysis.

whole genome scans of cap patients and cell lines have identified consistent, chromosomal alterations, which include recurrent loss of chromosomal regions from 5p, 6q, 8p, 10q,  <dig>  16q and 17p, in addition to gain on 1q, 3q 7p, 7q, 8q 11p, 17q and xpq  <cit> . nonetheless, one potential limitation with current cgh methodology is its requirement for microgram quantities of genomic dna. when studying cell lines this is not necessarily a matter for concern, as it is relatively straightforward to produce a sufficient quantity of clonal cells to obtain many micrograms of dna. however, when studying patient tissue if dna is "bulk extracted" from a heterogeneous non-clonal tumour mass the data obtained will represent an average value for all cells within the specimen and any clinically informative genetic changes, restricted to small cell clusters, may be masked. as a result, when studying a heterogeneous tissue, such as prostate, it is essential to obtain pure cell populations via methods such as macrodissection or lcm. the dna extracted from the dissected material can then be amplified using a whole genome amplification  technique  <cit> , such as mda  <cit> . the combination of lcm and wga can generate sufficient amounts of dna for extensive genome analyses. several large studies have demonstrated the ability of mda to accurately amplify human genomic dna. when used in snp genotyping  <cit>  an estimated  <dig> % of the genome is covered with a reported concordance, to non-amplified dna, of greater than 99%  <cit> . in addition, the sequence error rate is only  <dig>  ×  <dig>  <cit>  and previous results obtained from gacgh, using amplified dna, are almost indistinguishable from those obtained from non-amplified dna  <cit> .

an understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind cancer development will enable identification of molecular and cytogenetic biomarker that may be useful in predicting early transformation into an aggressive phenotype, as well as, providing fundamental insights into the regulatory pathways of genome  integrity that may lead to multistep field cancerization and hpin and cap. in the present study, we describe the use of lcm, mda and gacgh, using a  <dig> mb array  to investigate copy number changes occurring in prostate cancer by the analysis of  <dig> prostatic samples containing hpin and  <dig> cap specimens.

RESULTS
to determine whether whole genomic amplification exhibited bias or a distortion of imbalance assignments, control cgh experiments comparing the results obtained before and after amplification  from the same original dna samples were performed. these are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and it is evident that no major distortion of imbalance was introduced by amplification of genomic dna.

a summary of the chromosomal cnas detected by cgh for the  <dig> hpin and  <dig> cap samples is shown in table  <dig> and  <dig> and displayed graphically in figure  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows the frequency of cnas detected at the level of each chromosomes arm for hpin and cap. the general pattern of loss or gain was very similar in the hpin and cap samples, however cap samples possessed significantly more aberrations  than hpin samples  . the average number of cnas for the  <dig> hpin samples was  <dig>  . for the  <dig> cap samples an average of  <dig>   amplifications or deletions were observed. when studied at the  <dig> cytoband level , hpin samples had the total of  <dig> affected bands  and cap samples  <dig> affected breakpoints bands . this difference is statistically significant . in addition, for both the hpin and cap samples there were a significantly greater number of cytobands lost than gained  .

in the  <dig> hpin samples recurrent chromosomal changes, detected in greater  than 25% of cases, were losses found on 8p , 6q,  13q, 16q , whereas gains were found on 8q  and 16p , 1p, 7p and 20q . for the  <dig> cap samples recurrent chromosomal changes,  detected in greater than 25% of tumours, were losses on 8p , 10q , 13q , 6q , 1p, 16q ,  5q, 12p, 18q  and gains on 7q , 7p, 8q , 4p, 16p, 19p .  

small consensus regions of consistent cna were observed for both hpin and cap samples , in >25% of samples. for example, 8p region was consistently lost in hpin , but within the cytoband 8p <dig> -p <dig>  that was commonly lost in >50% of the hpin samples. similarly, 8p was consistently lost in cap , but within the cytoband 8p <dig> -p <dig>  that was commonly lost in >60% of the cap samples. a list of the genes present within these consensus or commonly lost regions is displayed in table  <dig> 

discussion
chromosome copy number abnormalities  are common in most cancers, with specific regions of amplification or deletion being associated with specific tumour types, stages or outcomes  <cit> . the introduction of metaphase cgh  <cit>  to study these cnas has eliminated the requirement to obtain metaphase spreads from the tumour samples, which was often challenging due to technical difficulties in culturing certain tissues. though metaphase cgh allows for more samples to be examined, it provides a relatively limited resolution and still requires substantial cytogenetic experience to analyse the results. the recent development of array cgh has opened up the field of cgh research and permitted more laboratories to study an ever-increasing number of tumour types and stages. the application of bac microarrays to analyse human samples is straightforward and their high-throughput nature makes them the method of choice for rapid detection of genetic alterations.

when analysing heterogeneous tumour samples, the gacgh results obtained from "bulk extracted" dna are likely to be inaccurate. however, with the use of lcm and mda we have been to able obtain highly purified hpin and cap dna and thus identify the particular chromosomal changes associated with the two disease stages.

in this study, we have used a  <dig> -element bac microarray with a resolution of ~ <dig> mb to study cnas in a set of  <dig> patient samples comprised of  <dig> hpin cases and  <dig> cap cases. for the  <dig> hpin cases,  <dig> genomic alterations  were identified, in contrast to the  <dig> genomic alterations  seen for the  <dig> cap cases. as with other cancers, cap development and progression is likely to be the outcome of a series of stepwise genetic changes. the accumulation of cnas, which occurs during this process, although likely due to increased genetic instability, is non-random and may indicate chromosomal regions important in tumourigenesis. it is suggested that failure in the fidelity of homologous recombination within the repetitive sequences, that comprise the kinetochore complex, could lead to recurrent loss of 8p and gain of 8q by rearrangement of chromosome 8-specific alphoid centromeric sequences. thus, the high fidelity process of homologous recombination can be the major dna repair pathway, which is indispensable for the maintenance of genetic stability.

examination of our array results indicates that aberrations involving parts or all of 1p, 6q, 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 10q, 13q 16p and 16q are most common, which is concordant with previous metaphase  <cit>  and array cgh  <cit>  results. it is therefore likely that the alterations in copy number are part of a programmed cycle of events that promote tumour development and progression as well having an impact on disease-specific survival.

a comparison of the cnas present in the hpin and cap samples identified a significant increase in copy number for 7q  and a significantly increased frequency of loss for 10q  and 13q . in genotype/phenotype correlations, gain of chromosome 7q  <cit>  and loss of 13q  <cit>  have been associated with advancing tumour stage and aggressiveness, which is in agreement with the results presented here. however, gain of 8q  <cit>  and loss of 16q  <cit>  have also been linked to tumour progression, but our data do not show any significant difference for these cnas in our hpin and cap samples. this would suggest that 8q and 16q cna's are likely to be early events in tumourigenesis. in addition, they may also identify hpin and cap samples that are likely to progress.

apart from the commonly reported cnas, additional alterations that have been less frequently reported in earlier cgh studies have also been identified. these include gains on 12q  and loss of 4q and 10q . whether the identification of 12q and 4q regions will provide additional insight into cap progression is not yet clear. further analysis using a platform such as tissue microarrays, which permits the screening of different disease stages from large patient cohorts, will help better identify their frequency and also the potential use of genomic imbalance in diagnosis of cap. the value of genomic analysis in cap was recently demonstrated by the discovery of a high frequency of chromosomal translocations leading to rearrangement of the fusion oncoproteins erg or etv <dig> with tmprss <dig>  <cit> .

a common problem when analysing archival tissue is the availability of a suitable quality and quantity of rna to study expression changes. though rna amplification techniques  <cit>  can generate a sufficient quantity, obtaining rna of the required quality is often challenging. previous reports have demonstrated a relationship between alterations in chromosomal copy number and alterations in gene expression  <cit> . the ability to distinguish these regions will point to genes, which may either directly  or indirectly contribute to tumour development and progression. as a result, cgh can be used as a surrogate for gene identification. candidate genes, which have previously been implicated in cap have been highlighted in bold in table  <dig>  the roles of myc  <cit> , psca  <cit> , and mdm <dig>  <cit>  have all been well reported and alterations in gene dosage correlate well with their change in expression. however, other candidate genes have been less well studied. for example, ebag <dig>  whose increased expression in cap is a negative prognostic indicator, has a potential role in progression by enabling cancer cells to evade the immune response  <cit> . nbs <dig>  which has been identified as a founder mutation causing an increased susceptibility to prostate cancer  <cit> , is involved in processing/repair of dna double strand breaks and in cell cycle checkpoints, thus its deregulation will likely contribute to chromosomal instability. fkhr, which is a member of the foxo forkhead transcription factor family, is thought to play a regulatory role in several cellular functions including cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . loss of fkhr expression, as observed in cap cell lines, is likely to abrogate this control leading to tumour cell growth. though these genes have previously been implicated in cap there are additional genes, including both oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, which reside within all of the affected regions that may play an important role in the aetiology of the disease. further analysis of these other candidates may identify their potential as molecular targets for diagnosis and treatment.

several of the genes present within altered regions of the genome are associated with genetic pathways, indicating that these pathways are likely to be important in prostate tumourigenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of techniques used in this study has allowed for the identification of consistent regions of copy number change, ranging from specific cytobands to whole chromosomes, starting with as little as 5– <dig> ng of dna. through our use of lcm, we have also identified several lower frequency cnas which may not have been detected when using bulk extracted dna due to the heterogeneous nature of prostate tissue. in addition, several interesting candidate genes have been observed within the altered chromosomal regions. although some have already been extensively studied others, which have not, may prove to be of clinical importance. genetic screening strategies that combine fish and immunohistochemistry for the detection of various combinations of chromosomal gains and/or losses and altered gene expression are likely to be of great use in diagnosis and prognosis prediction.
