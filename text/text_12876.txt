BACKGROUND
heterogeneity of the structural characteristics of genomic sequences, such as gc content
, cpg distribution, copy-number variation, and repetitive dna content has
been the subject of numerous studies for decades. other studies have been devoted to
heterogeneity of functional and evolutionary features of the genome, including protein-
and non-protein-coding dna, codon usage, developmental stage- and tissue-specificity of
gene expression, distribution of conserved and ultra-conserved regions, recombination
and mutation hot and cold spots, and linkage disequilibrium blocks  <cit> . many genomes have been sequenced and are available for further analysis.
nevertheless, the coding dna remains the genome’s most investigated component.
analyses of its structure and function have been the basis for a wide variety of
studies, ranging from the analysis of functionally related gene groups and
gene-alignment-based interspecies comparisons  <cit>  to analysis of gene-adjacent regulatory sequences  <cit> .

the simplest structural characteristic of genomic sequences is their nucleotide
composition. relatively good correspondence of nucleotide composition with the
chargaff’s second parity rule  <cit>  enables disregarding certain differences in the within-strand contents of g
vs. c, and a vs. t, and limiting nucleotide-composition studies to an analysis of the
molar proportion of g+c in dna, or gc content. gc content shows high heterogeneity along
the genome and correlates with many genomic features, such as recombination rate,
abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms , and different types of repetitive
elements  <cit> . of special interest is the well-known correlation of gc content with gene
density  <cit> . furthermore, gc-rich regions contain many compact genes with short introns,
whereas genes in gc-poor regions tend to contain larger introns  <cit> . a correlation between gc content and gene expression has been found as well  <cit> . it is generally accepted that broadly expressed  genes
typically reside in gc-rich regions, although the correlation strength between
gene-expression specificity and regional gc content may vary depending on the method
used to estimate expression  <cit> . furthermore, tissue-specificity of genes varies with their gc content; for
example, genes specifically expressed in the central nervous system are more gc rich
than housekeeping genes, whereas genes related to germ-line tissues tend to be gc-poor  <cit> .

recent studies have indicated that regulatory sequences of functional gene groups differ
in the genome’s gc-poor and gc-rich regions. in addition, sequences that might
influence nucleosome positioning and density differ between these two contrasting
regions . moreover, different functional gene groups have contrasting base
compositions  <cit> , which might explain the relationship between genes’ tissue-specificity
and their local gc content. in summary, investigations have shown a correlation between
isochore gc content and the resident genes nucleotide composition and functioning.

analyses of di- and trinucleotide frequencies in five gc-isochore families of the human
genome showed unexpected organizational differences between whole isochore sequences,
with the corresponding intergenic and coding sequences located in different isochores,
in exons and introns  <cit> . similar differences were found in gene regulatory regions and in local
sequences that might influence nucleosome positioning and density  <cit> . these differences in the abundance of short oligonucleotides might be
related to chromatin organization, which itself plays a role in gene expression and
replication timing. an important finding was that genome structural heterogeneity might
affect the distribution of gene categories on a larger scale than the classical
isochores  <cit> .

in earlier studies, we used the oligonucleotide-counting method ,
referred to as compositional spectrum analysis  for alignment-free genome
comparisons  <cit> . we recently employed this approach in an investigation of organizational
heterogeneity of vertebrate genomes with a special focus on the human genome  <cit> . we considered two types of heterogeneity: compositional  and organizational . a compositional spectrum  comparison of sequences with the same  gc content can detect groups of genomic segments with very different
organizational patterns . we were interested in testing whether the op of a genome
region affects the type of genes residing there, i.e. whether functionally related genes
tend to inhabit regions with similar ops. to test this, we arbitrarily divided the human
genome sequence into 100 kb segments and then classified them into five
compositional groups according to their average gc content. for each such gc range, we
identified large groups of segments that differed in their cs organization , and compared the genes residing in segments of the same op group;  <dig> of
the  <dig> op groups showed significant enrichment in genes connected to specific
gene-ontology  terms. thus, one of the analyzed groups was considerably enriched in
genes connected to the go terms “mitochondrion” and “ribonucleoprotein
complex”. another op group was enriched in genes related to a few go terms:
“epithelial cell differentiation”, “epithelium development”, and
“keratinocyte differentiation”. these findings enabled us to examine the
relationship between gene function and cs organization of the associated genome
regions.

RESULTS
as expected, op variability could be detected within each compositional group of
segments  <cit> . correspondingly, segments from each gc range were subdivided into clusters
according to op similarity. altogether, we identified  <dig> different op groups in the five
compositional groups. a substantial proportion of the segments contained protein-coding
genes . most of the genes
were located in segments of the l <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> compositional groups with moderate gc
content: 37–52% . as already known and discussed  <cit> , there is a strict correlation between gc content and gene density. we found
that l <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> compositional groups had higher op complexity than l <dig> and h3;
therefore, they could be subdivided into more op clusters. this last trend can be
partially explained by simple combinatorial rules based on a-c-t-g nucleotide
distribution  <cit> . we found that each op group contained segments that were widely spread among
and within different chromosomes. it is worth noting that our csa addressed the whole
segment sequence, including both the gene sequences and intergenic dna. .

different op groups are enriched in different functional gene categories
previous studies have clearly demonstrated that compositionally different genomic
segments  may also differ with respect to their genes’
functional categories. thus, a considerably higher proportion of housekeeping genes
was found in gc-rich vs. gc-poor human genome regions  <cit> . we hypothesized that genomic segments with different ops would display
functional specificity despite gc-content similarity  <cit> . to test this, csa was applied to 100 kb segments in the five
compositional groups with gc ranges corresponding to the classical isochores. we
found that segments sharing the same op type are significantly enriched in genes
related to the same biological process , biochemical
complex, or organellar components . these relations were identified by screening 38
op-type clusters: one-third showed significant enrichment for genes connected to
specific go terms. the main findings are illustrated by several examples from the
compositional groups l <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> presented in figure  <dig> 
and more comprehensive results are shown in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we also tested genome organization patterns using csa based
on the two-letter alphabet . in this
csa version, the abundance of 20-mer words was counted and compared to that of 10-mer
words in the full a, t, g, c alphabet  <cit> . although the results were not identical, they are similar and highly
correlated.

repeat-masking test
bearing in mind that repetitive dna sequences comprise a considerable proportion of
the human genome, we checked for an influence of these repeats on op group size and
go-term enrichment by employing the repeatmasker tool  on segments with
gc = 42–47%. in addition, we conducted op-group identification
within the repeat-masked  sequence, and analyzed the enrichment of the resulting
ops by genes related to the same go terms. differences in oligonucleotide frequencies
between op groups might come from repeat sequences; therefore, the two tests cannot
be expected to generate identical patterns. nonetheless, the results in the rm test
seemed quite similar to those in the original test. in the original test, we found
that  <dig> of the  <dig> op groups from the gc = 42–47% range were enriched for  <dig> go
terms ; for rm sequences,  <dig> out of  <dig> op groups were enriched
for  <dig> go terms . two out of the five op groups that were
found to be significantly enriched for specific go terms in the original test fully
coincided with those in the rm test. in total, 2/ <dig> of the go terms enriched in
certain op groups in the original test were also enriched in certain op groups under
the rm test. we believe that some of the repeat sequences, like other inter-genic dna
, might be important for regulation of gene expression or other processes
in which dna sequences of nearby genes are involved .
therefore, we decided that it would make more sense to show the csa results obtained
for the whole dna, including the repeats.

enrichment of op cluster from l <dig> group for the go term
“mitochondrion”
a subgroup corresponding to the l <dig> compositional group with similar op was termed as
l2-a cluster . out of  <dig> genes harbored by this
group,  <dig> were related to the go term “mitochondrion”  and are distributed among  <dig> loci
of  <dig> chromosomes . more than 900
chromosomal genes encoding human proteins are considered to be targeted to the
mitochondria  <cit> ; this number may be even larger  <cit> . many of the chromosomal genes encoding for these mitochondrion-targeted
proteins might have originated from the ancestral alpha-proteobacteria symbiont
genome  and been transferred to eukaryotic
chromosomes by horizontal gene transfer   <cit> . it is now widely accepted that genes related not only to metabolism, but
also to producing the eukaryotic membranes and nucleus were transferred from the
endosymbiont  <cit> .

the go term “intracellular non-membrane-bounded organelle” was also
significantly enriched in the l2-a op cluster . the go term “nuclear envelope” was connected
to  <dig> genes within the l2-a cluster, albeit with a higher benjamini p-value
 indicating that among these  <dig> genes, no more than one might be considered a
false positive . twenty-one genes in
the l2-a op cluster were found to be connected to the go term
“ribonucleoprotein complex”  and were located
in  <dig> chromosomes . some of these genes’ products are indeed
mitochondrial ribosomal proteins: mrps <dig>  mrps <dig>  mrps18c, mrpl <dig>  mrpl <dig>  mrpl <dig>  and
mrpl <dig>  however, the group also includes non-mitochondrial genes, for example,
sra <dig>  transcripts of sra <dig> have both coding and non-coding
co-activator activities; along with sra <dig> protein product srap, it performs
mixed co-activator/repressor functions in differentiation and metabolism. other
examples are ddx <dig>  which functions in germ-cell development, and
wdr <dig>  a wd <dig> repeat protein that is crucial for processing 32s precursor
ribosomal rna  and for cell proliferation. also worth noting is that in the l2
group, ry-based cs analysis revealed an op cluster very similar to l2-a with
respect to go-term enrichment;  <dig> of the  <dig> go terms that were found to be enriched in
this ry op cluster coincided with the terms enriched in the l2-a op cluster
obtained using k-mer csa in the standard four-letter alphabet .

op cluster from l <dig> group enriched in g-protein-coupled receptors 
the cluster termed l2-h included  <dig> genes. twenty eight of these genes, which
were connected to go term “g-protein-coupled receptor protein signaling
pathway” , were located in  <dig> loci on seven
chromosomes . moreover,  <dig> of these genes
were also connected to go term “sensory perception of smell”  and encoded olfactory receptors . the or subgroup of gpcrs is
one of the largest mammalian genome superfamilies. in the human genome, this group
includes approximately  <dig> genes, although ~51% of them are actually pseudogenes  <cit> . each or gene is approximately 1 kb in length, intronless, and found
in clusters on almost all chromosomes. in addition, like all gpcrs, each or gene
shares a common molecular architecture consisting of seven transmembrane domains.

h <dig> cluster related to epithelial cell differentiation
the op cluster h1-i included  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which were connected to the go
term “epithelial cell differentiation” ; this group and four additional
genes were connected to the go term “epithelium development” . although the  <dig> genes were
located in eight loci of five different chromosomes,  <dig> were clustered on chromosome
1q, including  <dig> late cornified envelope  genes that were also connected with
the go term “keratinocyte differentiation” . cluster h1-i also included
genes that have additional roles in the epithelium as well as in differentiation and
maturation of other tissues . some examples of these include: sprr <dig> 
induced by ultraviolet light and other environmental stresses  <cit> ; notch <dig>  known to delay hepatoblast maturation during early
hepatic organogenesis, and jag <dig> playing a role in hematopoiesis  <cit> ; grem <dig>  which is involved in regulating organogenesis, body
patterning, and tissue differentiation  <cit> ; onecut <dig>  which encodes a transcription factor mediating complex
processes in the liver and pancreas related to cell proliferation, cell-cycle
regulation, cell differentiation, and organogenesis  <cit> , and agt, reported to be involved in the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in renal epithelial cells  <cit>  and in maintaining blood pressure  <cit>  .

a developmental op cluster in the h <dig> group
one of the clusters from the h <dig> segment group  included 606
genes,  <dig> of which proved to be connected to the go term “skeletal system
development” . these genes were located in  <dig> loci
on  <dig> chromosomes, with the largest proportion represented by hox genes .
hox proteins are transcription factors  with a 60-amino-acid-long
dna-binding homeodomain. they can function as enhancers or repressors, and many of
them participate in morphological or developmental pattern regulation. hox
genes are located in four chromosomal loci ,
originating from duplication of a single ancestral cluster  <cit> . the h2-a op cluster included additional developmental genes:
pax <dig>  a tf gene with a paired-type homeodomain that plays a critical role
during fetal development; ring <dig>  which encodes a tf associated with the
multimeric polycomb protein complex; wnt3a and wnt7a implicated in
oncogenesis and in several developmental processes, including cell-fate regulation
and patterning during embryogenesis; left <dig> which plays a role in organ
system developmental left–right asymmetry determination; mmp <dig> 
encoding a matrix metalloproteinase involved in embryonic development, reproduction,
and tissue remodeling; notch <dig>  involved in developmental processes by
controlling cell-fate decisions and interaction between physically adjacent cells;
ret, playing a crucial role in neural crest development; hes <dig>  a
tf implicated in correct axial skeleton patterning; and hdac <dig>  encoding
histone deacetylase which represses transcription when tethered to a promoter. as
with the l2-a op cluster,  <dig> of the  <dig> go terms found to be enriched in the ry
op cluster coincided with  <dig> of the  <dig> go terms enriched in the h2-a op
cluster, obtained using the standard four-letter alphabet .

additional interesting cases of go-term enrichment in specific op clusters
the following are further interesting examples of functionally significant op
clusters from the l <dig> and h <dig> compositional segment groups. more details, including the
chromosomal loci and the names of included genes, can be found in additional files
 <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

 l2-b and h1-m clusters enriched for go terms
“keratin filaments” , and
“intermediate filament” , respectively. this example
demonstrates that functionally similar op clusters can be found in diverse gc groups,
implying that in such cases, op rather than gc content plays a role in the
positioning of the corresponding genes.

 l2-f cluster enriched for go term “keratin-associated
proteins” .

 l2-e and l2-g clusters enriched for go terms
“g-protein-coupled olfactory receptor, class ii” , and “g-protein-coupled receptor protein signaling
pathway” , respectively.

 h1-e and h1-j op clusters enriched for go terms
“nucleosome” , and
“kegg pathway: systematic lupus erythmatosus” , respectively.

 h1-h cluster enriched for go term “homophilic cell
adhesion” .

non-randomness of enrichments
the aforementioned results prompted the question of whether similar function-related
detection levels would be obtained if groups of the same size as the original op
groups were built by taking the segments at random within the same gc limits. this
question was addressed in the following way. within each of the three main gc ranges
, we randomly distributed
the 100-kb segments into groups with the same sizes as the  <dig> op groups obtained by
cs comparison. this was repeated  <dig> times and the resultant  <dig> random groups of
segments were checked for enrichment in genes related to specific go terms. such
enrichments were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> groups, which is significantly less than the
corresponding proportions in real op groups, where  <dig> out the  <dig> groups were enriched
by functionally related genes .
we further compared the op groups and random groups with respect to obtained
enrichment significance by go term , by applying
the mann–whitney u test  <cit>  to compare the distribution of -log <dig>  scores in op
groups and in random groups. enrichment in the op groups was characterized by
considerably higher -log <dig>  scores than in the randomly obtained
groups .
comparison using mann–whitney u test

we also analyzed three additional characteristics of the op and random groups, which
were found to be enriched in at least one group of functionally related genes. these
included:  the number of go terms per “non-empty” op group or its
random analogue with the assumption that go-term enrichment for real op groups should
be higher than for randomly formed groups;  the number of segments containing
functionally related genes connected with a go term; here we assumed that
enrichment due to high numbers of such “involved” segments reflects a
positive correlation between the genes’ shared functional relevance and their
shared residence in genome-wide distributed segments with similar sequence
organization; in random clusters on the other hand, such correlations could arise
only due to closely linked  genes;  the ratio of the
involved segments to all segments in the cluster . for all three criteria, the randomly combined groups showed
significantly lower enrichment compared to the real op groups formed from 100 kb
segments using k-mer analysis to assess sequence similarity .

discussion
gc-content variation within the genome displayed in the form of isochores  <cit> , and its function in human and other vertebrate genomes have been targeted in
many studies. in this analysis, we focused on another aspect of genome organization:
possible functional correlates of human genome “organizational
heterogeneity”  <cit> , displayed in the variation in the abundances of different oligonucleotide
“words” . in particular, we were interested in testing whether
region-specific “word” usage  may have functional or evolutionary implications, or both. we used cs
analysis  <cit>  to identify clusters of 100-kb segments with similar ops within five major gc
groups . we further looked for
go-term enrichment in each of the op clusters. we revealed that, in many cases, op
clusters were significantly enriched in genes involved in the same biological process
. there were also cases of genes within op clusters
involved in the same biochemical complex, or organelle. moreover, organizational
similarity of the clustered 100-kb segments and functional similarity of genes belonging
to these segments were observed despite the dispersed genome-segment locations. as the
calculations were made on the whole chromosomal sequence, the underlying ops should
include both coding and non-coding dna , the latter being
much more abundant in the genome than the former . therefore, we concluded that there might be a tendency for genes
involved in the same biological process/complex/organelle to use the same op, even far
away–up to 100 kb–from the genes. we do not know the mechanism
underlying this similarity, but these sites might share preferred dna-repair mechanisms
with a resulting similar bias for specific use of nucleotides and oligonucleotide
“words”  <cit> . another possibility is that genes of the same op cluster are controlled by
similar regulatory sequences . in this case, although the intergenic dna is non-coding, the general
sequence organization  may be very important and should be conserved.

the complexity of the human genome involves many layers of large-scale duplications
 and expansion of the gene repertoire of the
predecessor genomes by hgt. some of our op clusters might indeed reflect certain events
during hgt and genome-expansion periods, and the subsequent evolution of genomic regions
requiring coordinated regulation:  hgt from the alpha-proteobacteria symbiont
 to the primitive eukaryotes  <cit>  that may, to some extent, be related to the l2-a op cluster;  the
emergence of vertebrates from chordates by the two-round  whole genome duplication
  <cit>  relevant to the h2-a op-type cluster;  the segmental duplications
that enabled adaptation of vertebrates to life out of water, including expansion of
olfactory receptor genes  <cit>  relevant to the l2-h op cluster; and  expansion of gene families
related to the evolution of mammalian skin  that is better adapted to
water homeostasis than that of amphibians  <cit> . regarding the last statement, aside from the lce genes, go terms related to
keratins were found to be significantly enriched in some other op clusters . in the following, we discuss the possible evolutionary meaning
of the corresponding findings.

evolution of genome regions harboring “mitochondrion-related”
genes
the deepest genome expansion layer potentially reflected in the csa results is the
mitochondrion-related gene enrichment in the l2-a op cluster. hgt from the
alpha-proteobacteria symbiont to its eukaryotic host-cell genome happened  <dig> bya. some
of the complexities and the mixed-up eukaryote genome might have resulted from the
fact that bacteria that gave rise to mitochondria did not shrivel up into
atp-producing factories. instead, many of their genes were transferred to their
hosts’ genomes  <cit>  and, therefore, might subsequently have participated in producing the
eukaryotic membranes and nucleus  <cit> . in addition to the coding-gene transfers that benefitted the host, there
were probably many cases of dna sequence insertion that could not be expressed .

a preferential insertion of large, mitochondrial-origin dna fragments  to pericentromeric and
subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes was recently suggested by moon et al.  <cit> . however, as about half of the mitochondrion-related genes and pseudogenes
are not clustered   <cit> , it seems that these genes were rearranged during the subsequent genome
evolution by non-homologous end-joining repair of dna double-strand breaks  <cit> . our cs analysis was performed on 100-kb-length segments; hence both genes
and intergenic dna might be included on the same segment. therefore, with regard to
mitochondrial-origin genes, the fragments transferred from the symbiont  might have conserved their op even further away from the genes
themselves, at least within the range of 100 kb. alternatively, and more likely,
the extant gene locations do not directly represent the sites of ancient hgt events,
but are secondary, resulting from rearrangements and biased reinsertions into the
host chromosomal sites that share a similar op. according to our results, the op
seems to be conserved in both scenarios .

if our interpretation is correct, then analyzing op structure of additional
eukaryotic genomes should reveal enrichment for the go term
“mitochondrion” in at least one op type. however, such an analysis is
beyond the scope of the reported investigation.

ops and wgd
the refined 2r hypothesis assumes that two rounds of wgd took place after the
emergence of urochordates and before the radiation of jawed vertebrates, some  <dig> mya  <cit> . in almost all of the debates surrounding the 2r hypothesis, the
hox gene family which follows a 4: <dig> rule in the number of
vertebrate to invertebrate genes is used by proponents as a supporting argument  <cit> . the duplication of genomic loci provided increased flexibility, allowing
the generation of new expression patterns, and was critical for the emergence of
morphological novelties  <cit> . this “regulatory evolution” of the four hox gene
clusters involved enhancer elements distant from their target promoters  <cit> , where potential interference with modules of ancestral control was
minimized  <cit> . we assume that the csa results on hox gene enrichment in the
h2-a op cluster reflect the aforementioned large-scale genomic expansion
event and that op conservation at a distance of ≤100 kb from the gene
edges following these ancient duplication events is an important tier of process
regulation.

op and segmental duplications in the vertebrates’ “out of
water” evolution
expansion of several gene families occurred during the emergence of the class
amphibia, in the devonian period, about  <dig> mya. this might be represented by the
“signals” from cluster l2-h with its significant olfactory
receptor  enrichment. it has been suggested that expansion of the or gene
family was positively selected for in amphibians evolving from the fish lineage
during adaptation to terrestrial environments. this assumption is based on
variation in or gene number: about  <dig> in zebrafish and  <dig> in pufferfish  <cit>  as compared to  <dig> in xenopus tropicalis and 700– <dig> in
terrestrial mammals  <cit> . most of the x. tropicalis and mammalian or genes are class ii
genes  <cit>  that might be specialized for detecting airborne odorants  <cit> , which outnumber waterborne odorants.

the duplication of skin-related lce genes  seems to have
occurred during the emergence of the class mammalia about 200– <dig> mya. the
lce gene cluster on 1q <dig> is located within a 2-mb region called ‘the
epidermal differentiation complex’ which also includes additional clusters
of gene families encoding major proteins of late epidermal differentiation  - a sister protein family of lce  <cit> ). such protein family-clustered organization suggests duplication in
ancestors adapting to changes in terrestrial conditions in the course of evolution  <cit> . it has been suggested that in mammals, the developed
“grouping” of sprrs is better adjusted to subtle cellular and
environmental stimuli than a single or a few genes, as clusters could constitute
an “extended promoter”  <cit> . this might also be true for the lce genes responding
“group-wise” to environmental stimuli, such as calcium levels and
ultraviolet light, though only lce3b and lce3c encode proteins
involved in barrier repair after injury or inflammation  <cit> .

similar to the afore-discussed major examples of op-function correlations, the
examples provided in the section “additional interesting cases”, may
also reflect important events in vertebrate evolution. thus, cases  and
  might relate to expansion events of protein/gene
families related to keratin, the key structural material making up the outer layer
of skin and hair. the expansion of keratin families occurred during the emergence
of the amniotes  and played essential roles in the formation of
rigid and resistant hair shafts  <cit> . case  is an additional example of the expansion of ors and
other gpcrs. the example in case  shows that histone genes from
different chromosomal loci belong to the same op clusters. gene duplication has
prevailed as the major mechanism in providing the eukaryotic cell with the
required histone number and diversity  <cit> . histone variability in multicellular organisms is required to
accommodate the different packing needs and gene-expression regulation in
different cell types and developmental stages.

CONCLUSIONS
in many examples, the similarity of the local microgeographical “accents”,
that is, gene-harboring segments belonging to the same op cluster, seems to have derived
from duplications of one origin. this might be a large-scale duplication, for example,
wgd presumably reflected by the h2-a op cluster, or segmental duplications
presumably exemplified by the l2-h and h1-i clusters. duplications of
minor-sized chromosomal dna stretches are more abundant and could have occurred due to
unequal crossing-over between misaligned homologous chromosomes. regardless of the exact
scenario for the duplication event, the results point to conservation of dna sequence
ops that are distant  from the genes’ edges. these sequences
might be important in regulation of gene expression, or in other processes in which dna
sequences of nearby genes are involved . our
