BACKGROUND
next generation sequencing technologies and snp-chip genotyping with genome-wide coverage are affordable high-throughput genomics tools that are now being used in many research projects. thus, large amounts of data are being quickly generated that will increasingly require novel methods for efficient data mining and analysis. in many genetic studies aimed at identifying genes determining phenotypic variation in species or populations, two phenotypically divergent groups or populations are compared to search for underlying mutations, genes and pathways. typically, initial mapping of contributing loci is done using either genome-wide association studies  or genome scans for quantitative trait loci . the initial mapping usually highlights a relatively large genomic region containing one or several genes with a phenotypic effect on the trait and is thus often followed by fine-mapping strategies using sample material where the causative mutation are present on shorter haplotype blocks due to more generations of recombination  <cit> . fine mapping can often be improved by adding more genetic markers, particularly if the haplotype blocks in the populations studied are shorter than the average distance between the original markers used for mapping. the new markers should be highly informative for the groups or populations being compared. such markers are also crucial in marker-based breeding strategies such as generating introgression and congenic lines, where individuals should have different genotypes in regions of interest but homogenous genomic backgrounds  <cit> . the task of efficiently identifying suitable genetic markers is particularly challenging when there is considerable genetic variation within each line or group. this is usually the situation with outbred domestic animals, which may show considerable phenotypic differences between strains or breeds, but also be highly genetically variable within breeds.

here, we have evaluated the sensitivity of informative snp detection using genome resequencing. pooled samples from two chicken lines that were divergently selected for  <dig> generations  <cit>  have been resequenced with 5x depth coverage. the lines display a nine-fold difference in body weight at  <dig> days of age and have previously been used for qtl mapping of growth related traits  <cit> . we present a computational method where the information from flanking snps is used as an indicator of genotypic divergence between resequenced populations and compare the results from this method to those obtained by individual genotyping with the illumina  <dig> k chicken snp chip.

RESULTS
 <dig> k snp chip genotyping
the  <dig> k snp chip genotyping of  <dig> individuals from each of the high and low lines sampled at generation  <dig> assayed  <dig>  <dig> snps located on autosomes  <dig> to  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  <dig> snps  had a call frequency >  <dig> . polymorphism within or between the high and low lines was detected for  <dig>  <dig> snps  and of these,  <dig>  <dig>  were also detected with the abi solid resequencing. as expected, the fraction of  <dig> k snps detected with the resequencing increased with the frequency of the non-reference allele in the population represented in the dna pool .

genome resequencing
the resequencing of chicken autosomes 1-  <dig> resulted in ~ <dig> mbp of consensus sequence  from each of the lines, which corresponds to ~ <dig> % of the red jungle fowl reference sequence from these chromosomes according to the may  <dig> assembly of the chicken genome  <cit> . the depth coverage was  <dig> x and  <dig> x for the high and low line, respectively, as recently reported  <cit> . this revealed a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> snps, which corresponds to around  <dig>  snps/kb. the number and fraction of snps detected, classified according to their variation within line against the rjf reference, are given in table  <dig>  the snp density varied slightly between macrochromosomes , chromosomes of intermediate length  and microchromosomes . the observed snp detection rate with 5x genome resequencing of dna pools for different non-reference allele frequency classes in the represented populations are shown in figure  <dig>  on average, nearly six reads covered each detected snp, with approximately 1% more coverage on macrochromosomes than on microchromosomes.

correlation of allele frequency differences between lines from the  <dig> k snp genotyping and the flanking snps value from resequencing
the overall correlation between the  <dig> k snp allele frequency difference between lines and the flanking snps value  was moderate  for the fsv interval with the strongest correlation . the correlation was, however, highly dependent on the difference in allele frequency between the lines. there was no correlation for snps with low variation between lines and a clear correlation for snps with more variation between lines . for snps with an allele frequency difference between lines >  <dig> , the genome-wide  correlation between the two measures was highest when the interval used for fsv computation was  <dig> kb . as shown in figure  <dig>  the degree of correlation, as well as the size of fsv interval that gave the highest correlation, varied between chromosome size classes. the macrochromosomes , showed maximum correlation with a  <dig> kb fsv interval , whereas for the intermediate chromosomes  and the microchromosomes  the highest correlations were with  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb intervals , respectively .

discussion
in this study, we have compared snp detection rates in resequencing of pooled samples from two genetically divergent chicken lines with allele frequency estimates using  <dig> k snp genotyping of individual samples. using a snp detection threshold of three non-reference reads for each pool, a total of approximately  <dig>  snps/kb were found in the resequencing data. this is less than the around  <dig> snps/kb found in previous chicken comparisons  <cit> . furthermore, less than 50% of the  <dig> k snps that showed variation within or between the chicken lines were detected in the resequencing data. the reason for this low detection rate is the limited depth coverage  combined with a low non-reference allele frequency among the undetected snps. on the other hand, when there is a large allele frequency difference between lines, one line will have a high frequency of a non-reference allele, which increases the probability to reach over the snp detection threshold of three non-reference reads in resequencing . in many studies, the most interesting snps will be those where there is a high allele-frequency difference or fixation for alternative alleles in the studied populations as these are putative causative mutations or represent opposite selective sweeps. here we have reported, however, that resequencing of pools of individuals with approximately 5x depth coverage failed to identify 33% of the snps that were fixed for alternative alleles in the two lines according to the snp chip data . thus, a higher depth coverage in genome resequencing and additional resequencing of targeted regions should be considered to increase the detection sensitivity.

we have proposed a new measure for identifying informative snps from low coverage resequencing data, which takes into account variation in flanking snps . we have also demonstrated a positive correlation between fsv and the difference in allele frequency between lines from the  <dig> k snp chip data. the correlation was strongest on the macrochromosomes when fsv was calculated with a  <dig> kb interval. for the microchromosomes the optimal interval size was considerably shorter  and the correlation weaker, probably due to a higher recombination rate and/or a higher mutation rate  <cit> . however, despite a presumed higher mutation rate on microchromosomes, the overall density of snps detected in resequencing was approximately 5% lower on the microchromosomes than on macrochromosomes. this is probably due to a considerably higher gene density on the microchromosomes and consequently a larger proportion of conserved sequence under purifying selection  <cit> . the optimal fsv interval size with the highest correlation between fsv and snp variation between lines may approximately correspond to the average ld block size in these populations.

no correlation was observed between fsv and difference in allele frequency between lines that were lower than  <dig> . a plausible explanation is that the fsv is most affected by random sampling effects for the few sequencing reads covering the snp, when the difference in allele frequencies is small. for example, if both lines show a high frequency for a non-reference allele there will be many cases where only one of the lines reaches over the snp detection level, whereas the other line will be assumed to be fixed for the rjf allele. this would incorrectly increase the fsv and lower the correlation with the true snp variation between lines. in other words, most random sampling effects among sequencing reads from a pool of dna samples would increase the fsv and thereby reduce the correlation with snp variation between lines if that variation is small. another possible explanation is that large difference in allele frequencies between the two lines studied at a biallelic locus includes less sensitivity to such random sampling effects, because of one predominant allele in each line that is relatively rare or absent in the other line.

in summary, our results show that the depth coverage and pooling of samples limits snp detection sensitivity using resequencing. the described measure, however, makes better use of available sequence information than studies using only individual snp positions and can thereby provide a valuable indication of the snp variation-between resequenced populations, even when the depth coverage is quite low and pooled samples are sequenced. this could, for example, facilitate the selection of the most informative snps for a genotyping panel among millions of putative candidates detected in resequencing. in selecting snps it is also important to consider how many reads covered the snp position and the individual snp score indicating the fraction of reads in agreement with the reference. when there exist a very large number of snps to choose from it would be possible to stringently select snps with high fsv, large number of covering reads and a high proportion of non-reference reads.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic resequencing with limited coverage  using pooled dna samples can be used to detect the majority of snps with an allele frequency difference larger than  <dig>  between the pools. for any detected snp, computation of the variation among flanking snps  based on the resequencing read scoring, can be used for estimating of the degree of polymorphism between the populations. this correlation is more accurate for chicken macrochromosomes than for microchromosomes, probably due to a higher recombination rate and more haplotype variation on the microchromosomes.
