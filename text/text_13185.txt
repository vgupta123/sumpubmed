BACKGROUND
the constant interactions of infectious microbes with their hosts explain the emergence of complex immune systems. comparative immunology provides one of the best approaches to understanding the logic of metazoan host defense mechanisms and their diversification throughout evolution. this approach reveals that despite the apparently extreme diversity of immune reactions, similar mechanisms are used across the animal kingdom to cope with microbes. phagocytosis, epithelial production of antimicrobial peptides, sequestration of iron or mucus barriers are found in many organisms, indicating either an ancient origin or their recurrent emergence by convergent evolution. other immune modules are specific to a limited number of organisms. emergence, loss and diversification of these immune modules are thought to reflect the evolutionary trajectory of metazoan lineages facing various selective pressures from pathogens. immune diversification has often involved the expansion of particular gene families. for instance, the number of genes encoding toll-like receptors, peptidoglycan recognition proteins and c-type lectins markedly varies among phyla  <cit> . a better understanding of the metazoan immune system requires an analysis of the rules underlying such immune gene amplification. the recently developed crispr/cas <dig> genome editing approach offers a new strategy for generating mutations in a quasi-systematic manner. this allows, for the first time, the question of gene family diversification to be tackled, by generating mutations in single and multiple genes belonging to the same family. we previously reported the functional analysis of two of the three drosophila prophenoloxidases , ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  using single- and double-mutant analysis  <cit> . we subsequently realized that the ppo <dig> ppo <dig> double-mutant stock used in our previous study carries a mutation in the ppo <dig> gene. here, we investigate the function of ppo <dig>  and perform a single-, double- and triple-mutant analysis of the three drosophila ppos. our study extends our previous results and attributes specific and complementary functions to each of the three ppos, providing an insight into how this protein family has evolved in drosophila.

melanization is a major immune module found in arthropods but not in vertebrates  <cit> . it involves the rapid synthesis of a black pigment named melanin, at the site of infection or injury. a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis is phenoloxidase , which catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinones, which subsequently polymerize into melanin. po is usually synthesized as a zymogen called prophenoloxidase , which is cleaved to generate the active po enzyme upon activation of a proteolytic cascade. several roles have been ascribed to the melanization reaction in insects . po activity contributes to wound healing by forming a scab at the epithelial injury site. by-products of po activity are reactive oxygen species, which are thought to contribute to the killing of microbes and pathogens. finally, melanization participates in the encapsulation reaction against parasites. deposition of melanin on the parasite forms a physical barrier, allowing the localized and confined production of toxic compounds while ensuring the protection of the host. melanization is clearly an arthropod-specific mechanism, but its functions in providing a barrier and generating microbicidal reactive oxygen species are usually carried out by other mechanisms in other species.

the drosophila melanogaster genome contains three ppo genes, all on the second chromosome  <cit> . ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are produced in specialized hemocytes , called crystal cells. crystal cells represent 5 % of the hemocyte population in larvae  <cit> . upon injury, they rupture and release ppos into the hemolymph , where they are activated by a cascade of serine proteases   <cit> . using null mutations in ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  we recently showed that ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are responsible for all the po activity in the hemolymph  <cit> . while ppo <dig> is involved in the rapid early delivery of po activity, ppo <dig> present in the crystals of crystal cells provides a storage form, which can be deployed in a later phase  <cit> . this and other studies also revealed an important role for ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> in survival after infection with gram-positive bacteria and fungi, underlining the importance of melanization in insect host defense . however, previous work left open the question of the function of the third ppo, ppo <dig>  which could not be addressed because no mutant was available. the expression pattern of ppo <dig> was not clear either. some reports suggested that ppo <dig> is expressed in crystal cells  <cit> , while others proposed it is expressed in lamellocytes  <cit> . lamellocytes are a type of larval hemocytes that are induced upon injury or wasp infection and play a key role in the encapsulation of foreign bodies and parasites  <cit> . interestingly, while ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> require proteolytic cleavage to be activated, ppo <dig> is thought to be produced in an active form, although a putative cleavage site is present  <cit> .

the starting point of the present study came with the serendipitous observation that the ppo1Δ,ppo2Δ double mutant that we previously used to analyze the role of ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  <cit> , also carries a cryptic null deletion in ppo <dig>  this raised the possibility that the phenotype initially attributed to ppo <dig> and/or ppo <dig> could be caused by the absence of ppo <dig>  to clarify this question, we separated the ppo <dig> mutation from the ppo1Δ and ppo2Δ mutations and additionally generated an independent ppo <dig> mutant using the crispr/cas <dig> approach  <cit> . using single, double and triple mutants of the three ppo genes, we confirm that ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are the only source of hemolymphatic po upon septic injury. our study also reveals a role for ppo <dig> in the encapsulation process, in association with ppo <dig> 

RESULTS
identification of a cryptic ppo <dig> deletion in the ppo1Δ,ppo2Δ double-mutant stock
by testing primers for the ppo <dig> gene, we serendipitously discovered the presence of a deletion of 336 bp, removing  <dig>  of the  <dig> amino acids of the ppo <dig> protein . this deletion is referred to as ppo <dig>  and we use parentheses around this mutant to refer to previous results where this mutant was present in a cryptic state. as the deletion does not change the reading frame, a residual protein is expected to be produced, lacking part of a conserved copper-binding domain found in all ppos . the presence of this cryptic mutation raised the possibility that some of the phenotypes observed in the ppo1Δ,2Δ, flies could be due to the absence of ppo <dig>  to clarify the function of the three ppos, we separated ppo <dig> from ppo1Δ and ppo2Δ by meiotic recombination. we also induced a null mutation in ppo <dig> using crispr/cas <dig>  referred to as ppo3sk <dig>  which is caused by a frameshift mutation in the first exon of the gene . both the ppo <dig> and ppo3sk <dig> mutations, which were generated in two distinct genetic backgrounds, show the same phenotype in all the experiments described below, indicating that ppo <dig> is also a null mutation. as expected, ppo <dig> mutants are perfectly viable and do not exhibit any overt developmental or pigmentation defect. figure 1c shows that ppo1Δ,2Δ and ppo1Δ,2Δ, <dig> but not ppo <dig> flies have a reduced life expectancy, confirming that the simultaneous presence of ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> is required for optimal fly longevity  <cit> .fig.  <dig> molecular characterization of two novel ppo <dig> mutations. a schematic representation of the ppo <dig> gene locus and ppo <dig> coding sequence. the gene map was adapted from flybase. the ppo3

po <dig> and po <dig> are the sole pos contributing to hemolymph injury-mediated melanization in larvae and adults
using a needle to injure wild-type larvae or adults induces a melanization spot at the wound site, the extent of which is usually proportional to the injury size. this blackening reaction results from de novo melanin synthesis catalyzed by po and is further enhanced by the presence of microbial products  <cit> . our previous study attributed all hemolymphatic po activity to ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> due to the absence of melanization in the ppo1Δ,2Δ, stocks, while single ppo <dig> or ppo <dig> mutants showed only reduced or almost normal melanization, respectively. consistent with this finding, no melanization spot on the cuticle of injured ppo1Δ,2Δ and ppo1Δ,2Δ, <dig> mutants was observed . in contrast, ppo <dig> mutants show a wild-type level of melanization in injured larvae and adults. we next measured po activity via the l-dopa assay in hemolymph samples extracted from larvae. we found no significant difference in po activity between ppo <dig> and wild-type hemolymph samples. in contrast, hemolymph samples of ppo <dig>  deficient larvae show no po activity, indicating that ppo <dig> alone is not sufficient to produce po activity in hemolymph . this confirms that ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> together produce all injury-mediated melanization in larvae and adults  <cit> . survival analyses had shown that po is required for resistance to microbial infection, notably to gram-positive bacteria and fungi  <cit> . survival analyses using the new fly lines now show that the strict ppo1Δ,2Δ double mutation recapitulates all the phenotypes previously described using ppo1Δ,2Δ,: ppo1Δ,2Δ flies are more susceptible to septic injury with the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis and exhibit a mild susceptibility to natural infection with the fungus beauveria bassiana . in contrast, ppo3sk <dig> flies exhibit a wild-type level of resistance upon challenge with the same microbes. these experiments confirm the important role of melanization in fighting infection by gram-positive bacteria and fungi, and are consistent with our previous results indicating that ppo <dig> and  <dig> are the sole sources for hemolymphatic po. additional data  show that ppo <dig> does not markedly affect the toll and imd pathways in adults as revealed by the wild-type inducibility of diptericin and drosomycin, their respective read-out genes, in this mutant.fig.  <dig> both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> but not ppo <dig> contribute to injury-related melanization in adults and larvae. melanization of adults  and larvae  after clean injury is abolished only in the simultaneous absence of ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  a normal melanization spot was observed in the two ppo <dig> mutants. arrows indicate the pricking site. adults and larvae were wounded with a tungsten needle and blackening of the wound was recorded 1 h later in larvae and 16 h later in adults. a representative picture is shown for each genotype

ppo <dig> is specifically expressed in lamellocytes
drosophila larvae have two types of hemocytes in the unchallenged state: plasmatocytes, which are macrophage-like cells, and crystal cells, which produce ppo <dig> and contain crystals of ppo <dig>  <cit> . a third ‘inducible’ cell type, the lamellocytes, is produced only upon wasp infection or injury. lamellocytes are large flat cells that differentiate in the lymph gland or from circulating plasmatocytes and adhere to foreign objects or aberrant tissue in a process called encapsulation. capsules are usually melanized in a secondary step. the expression pattern of ppo <dig> has been a source of conflicting observations. irving et al.  <cit>  reported its localization in lamellocytes using a microarray approach. in contrast, several studies  <cit>  report expression of ppo <dig> in crystal cells. the observation that ubiquitous silencing of ppo <dig> by in vivo rnai suppresses melanization induced by the melanotic tumor hoptuml mutation, led nam et al.  <cit>  to hypothesize that ppo <dig> is indeed expressed in lamellocytes. to distinguish between these two possibilities, we generated a reporter gene in which the yeast transcription factor gal <dig> is under the control of  <dig>  kb of ppo <dig> upstream sequences. this transgenic line was crossed with uas-gfp flies to reveal the expression profile of ppo <dig> using green fluorescent protein . we found no expression of ppo3-gal <dig> in plasmatocytes or crystal cells from naive larvae . we then analyzed the expression pattern of ppo3-gal4;uas-gfp in larvae upon infestation with the parasitoid wasp leptopilina boulardi, which induces a massive production of lamellocytes. figure 5a, b shows that the ppo <dig> reporter was not expressed in plasmatocytes or crystal cells in parasitized larvae, but was strongly expressed in all lamellocytes. high numbers of gfp positive lamellocytes were observed in circulation or around the wasp egg . no other tissue or cell expressed the reporter and no expression was detected in embryos and adults, consistent with the absence of lamellocytes at these two stages.fig.  <dig> ppo <dig> is specifically expressed in lamellocytes. differential interference contrast  and gfp fluorescence micrographs of hemocytes from larvae infested with leptopilina boulardi expressing a ppo3-gal <dig> uas-gfp construct show that ppo <dig> is specifically expressed in all lamellocytes  either in circulation  or in the capsule surrounding the wasp egg . plasmatocytes  and crystal cells  do not express the reporter gene. gfp expression is green and dapi staining is shown in blue. an overview of the whole infested larvae is shown in . the arrow indicates the site of the wasp larvae. note that lamellocytes are found both around the egg and in circulation. e quantitative reverse-transcription pcr  shows that ppo <dig> gene expression is higher in larvae infested with l. boulardi compared to unchallenged larvae. in the graph, 100 % corresponds to ppo <dig> expression levels of naive larvae. dapi 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, gfp green fluorescent protein, uc unchallenged



consistent with these observations and previous reports  <cit> , qrt-pcr analysis indicated that the level of ppo <dig> transcripts is low in unchallenged wild-type larvae but markedly up-regulated in larvae collected 52 h after wasp infestation, when lamellocytes have become abundant . while ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are produced by crystal cells, our data clearly demonstrate that ppo <dig> is specifically expressed in lamellocytes. since lamellocytes are absent in adults, this observation also explains why ppo <dig> does not contribute to hemolymphatic po activity upon injury during this stage.

both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> contribute to capsule melanization
a surprising result of binggeli et al. was the observation that capsules around parasitoid wasp eggs were not melanized in ppo1Δ,2Δ, larvae  <cit> . this led us to conclude prematurely that ppo <dig> was not essential for the melanization process during encapsulation. the discovery of the cryptic ppo <dig> mutation in the original stock and the specific expression of ppo <dig> in lamellocytes prompted us to analyze further the role of ppo <dig> in the encapsulation process. wild-type, ppo <dig>  ppo1Δ,2Δ and ppo1Δ,2Δ,31 second-instar larvae were infested by leptopilina boulardi, and the presence of a melanized wasp egg was subsequently analyzed. figure  <dig> shows the presence of melanized l. boulardi eggs in wild-type, ppo1Δ,2Δ double-mutant and ppo <dig> single-mutant third-instar larvae. in contrast, no melanized capsules were ever observed in the infested triple ppo1Δ,2Δ, <dig> mutants . contradicting our previous conclusion, this result indicates that ppo <dig> does play a role in encapsulation that can be masked by the presence of ppo <dig> and/or ppo <dig>  we then generated ppo1Δ, <dig> and ppo2Δ, <dig> double mutants to determine which of ppo <dig> or ppo <dig> contributes to capsule melanization together with ppo <dig>  the result was unambiguous: we never found melanized capsules in l. boulardi infested ppo2Δ, <dig> larvae while ppo1Δ, <dig> larvae were phenotypically indistinguishable from ppo <dig> . thus, two ppos from different origins, ppo <dig> from crystal cells and ppo <dig> from lamellocytes, contribute to melanization that accompanies encapsulation.fig.  <dig> both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> contribute to melanization around a wasp capsule. representative photos showing infested larvae containing eggs from a leptopilina boulardi parasitoid wasp. larvae mutant for ppo3

heating larvae at 65 °c for 10 min induces the spontaneous activation of ppo  <cit> . as a consequence of this treatment, the population of sessile crystal cells that are attached underneath the integument can easily be visualized through the cuticle as black dots  <cit> . we used this method to investigate the respective contribution of the three ppos to the melanization reaction. consistent with the notion that black dots after heating are caused by the presence of ppo <dig> in crystal cells, ppo1Δ and ppo <dig> mutant larvae had melanized dots corresponding to the sessile crystal cells, but ppo2Δ mutants did not . we then subjected third-instar larvae previously infested by l. boulardi to the heat treatment. in addition to the black dots corresponding to the spontaneous activation of ppo <dig> in crystal cells, wild-type larvae infested with l. boulardi show large black spots that were not observed in unchallenged larvae . the same treatment  applied to the various ppo mutants suggests that the large black spots are due to ppo <dig> activity in lamellocytes, as they are totally absent in ppo <dig> larvae. our conclusions were further strengthened by the observation that silencing ppo <dig> by rnai in lamellocytes alone using the ppo3-gal <dig> driver phenocopied the ppo <dig> phenotype. furthermore, a knot mutant , which cannot produce lamellocytes  <cit> , shows a melanization pattern similar to the ppo <dig> mutants following wasp infestation.fig.  <dig> phenoloxidase activity in ppo mutant larvae upon wasp infestation as revealed by heat treatment. representative photos showing unchallenged larvae  and larvae infested by leptopilina boulardi parasitoid wasps after heat treatment . black dots on the cuticle correspond to melanized crystal cells due to ppo <dig> activity . large black patches correspond to melanized lamellocytes due to ppo <dig> activity . knot

melanization linked to encapsulation is not dependent on hayan or sp7
it has been proposed that ppo <dig> is produced in its active form, while ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are synthesized as zymogens, which are cleaved by sp activity to generate the active form  <cit> . this cleavage is thought to be mediated by a clip-domain sp named hayan  <cit> . hayan also exists as a zymogen that is itself stimulated through a stepwise process involving other sps. one upstream clip-domain sp is sp <dig> , which is specifically expressed in crystal cells . indeed, while a null mutation in hayan totally abolishes hemolymphatic po activity in adults  <cit> , a partial sp <dig> loss-of-function, sp7pae <dig>  slightly reduces it  <cit> . to date, the roles of hayan and sp <dig> in the encapsulation reaction in larvae have not been fully clarified.

to address the role of sp cleavage in larval and adult melanization, we first generated using cripr/cas <dig> two null mutations in hayan and sp <dig> and analyzed their contribution to the melanization reaction using the same techniques as described above. we confirmed that both sp7sk <dig> and hayansk <dig> mutations affect melanization at an injury site, with slight differences according to the stage of the animal. as expected, the newly generated null sp <dig> mutant, sp7sk <dig>  induces a much stronger phenotype than the previously described hypomorphic sp7pae <dig> allele: sp7sk <dig> mutant adults show a very weak melanized spot at the injury site compared to sp7pae <dig> . as expected  <cit> , the hayansk <dig> mutation totally abolishes melanization at the injury site in adult flies. interestingly, injured hayansk <dig> and sp7sk <dig> larvae had opposite phenotypes compared to mutant adults. whereas sp7Δ larvae do not develop any melanization at the injury site, hayansk <dig> larvae still display a very weak blackening reaction . however, both sp7sk <dig> and hayansk <dig> larvae showed a wild-type pattern of melanized black dots upon heating at 65 °c . this result indicates that heat treatment can induce spontaneous activation of ppo in crystal cells in the absence of upstream sps. finally, we observed that both sp7sk <dig> and hayansk <dig> mutant larvae can produce melanized capsules around l. boulardi eggs . this indicates that hayan and sp <dig> are not mandatory for the melanization around the capsule, although a minor contribution of these sps cannot be excluded. in summary, the loss of hayan or sp <dig> both mimic the ppo1Δ,2Δ phenotype, pointing to a major role of these sps following septic injury. the formation of wild-type melanized capsules in both sp mutants is consistent with the observation that ppo <dig> does not need cleavage to become active.fig.  <dig> hayan and sp <dig> do not contribute to melanization of a wasp capsule. melanization of adults  after clean injury is abolished only in the hayan

ppo <dig> arose by gene duplication from ppo <dig> during radiation of the d. melanogaster group
to place the functional differences among drosophila ppo genes in an evolutionary context, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the ppo gene family using genome sequences from  <dig> species of drosophila  <cit> . we confirmed previous observations by salazar-jaramillo et al.  <cit>  that the ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> genes are conserved across all drosophila genomes sequenced, whereas ppo <dig> is restricted to the d. melanogaster group . by analyzing a larger panel of species in the d. melanogaster group than in previous work  <cit> , we found that a canonical d. melanogaster-like ppo <dig> gene can only be found in the d. melanogaster subgroup  and d. eugracilis, but not in other members of the d. melanogaster group or species outside this group. evidence for a partial ppo <dig> gene can be found in d. takahashii , which may indicate that a ppo3-like gene was present in the ancestor of these species. all drosophila species with canonical  ppo <dig> genes are able to encapsulate parasitoid wasps melanotically and to produce lamellocytes  <cit> . however, additional species in the d. melanogaster group  are also able to cellularly encapsulate wasps and produce lamellocytes  <cit> , suggesting that the acquisition or retention of ppo3-based melanization in lamellocytes occurred after the cellular basis for encapsulating parasitoid wasps evolved.

phylogenetic evidence for all ppo genes in drosophila shows the ppo <dig> clade clusters more closely with ppo <dig> than with ppo <dig> , consistent with the functional overlap between ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> reported here. moreover, both ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> have a four-exon gene structure, whereas ppo <dig> has six exons. the ppo gene tree also shows that all ppo <dig> genes cluster together outside the ppo <dig> clade, which is consistent with two hypotheses for the timing of the ppo <dig> duplication event:  the ppo <dig> gene arose prior to the diversification of the drosophila and sophophora subgenera and was subsequently lost in multiple lineages, or  the ppo <dig> gene arose in the d. melanogaster group and underwent a transient period of accelerated sequence evolution shortly after duplication. assuming the species tree in ometto et al.  <cit> , an ancient origin is unlikely because it requires one gain and at least seven independent losses in different drosophila lineages, while simultaneously invoking selective maintenance of an ancestral ppo <dig> prior to the evolution of the lamellocyte cell type on the lineage leading to the d. melanogaster group. a recent origin is more parsimonious and only requires a single evolutionary event followed by an accelerated rate of evolution in one of the genes after duplication , a pattern that has been observed for duplicate genes in yeast and mammals  <cit> . thus, we conclude a ppo2-like ancestral gene was likely the source for the ppo <dig> gene duplication event, and that this event most likely occurred recently during the radiation of the d. melanogaster group species.

the maximal genomic extent of the ppo <dig> duplication  does not fully contain the sequence in our ppo3-gal <dig> reporter construct that is needed to give lamellocyte expression . in fact, the region of our reporter that extends the regulatory region reported by ferjoux et al.  <cit>  and likely contains lamellocyte-specific regulatory elements lies within the neighboring gene cg <dig>  which is conserved in d. ananassae. thus, it is likely that regulatory sequences responsible for lamellocyte expression were not a part of the ancestral locus that gave rise to ppo <dig>  but rather arose during or after the ppo <dig> duplication event.

after the gain of ppo <dig>  d. sechellia subsequently lost the ability to produce lamellocytes and melanotically encapsulate parasitoids  <cit> . salazar-jaramillo et al.  <cit>  found an accelerated rate of evolution in the d. sechellia ppo <dig> gene , which they proposed reflected relaxation of selective constraints on ppo <dig> associated with the loss of the melanotic encapsulation phenotype. we found no evidence for an increased rate of evolution of the d. sechellia ppo <dig> gene in our data, and tracked this discrepancy to a gene model error in flybase that fuses incomplete versions of ppo <dig> and a neighboring gene  in d. sechellia that was used by salazar-jaramillo et al.  <cit> . we did, however, find evidence for an inactivating mutation in the d. sechellia ppo <dig> gene at amino acid position  <dig>  which converts the terminal glutamine residue of the propeptide region to a stop codon, and is predicted to generate a truncated version of the ppo <dig> protein. this loss-of-function coding-sequence mutation together with loss of ppo <dig> expression in d. sechellia  <cit>  supports the general model that ppo <dig> functions specifically in lamellocytes, and that the proper cellular context for its function in melanotic encapsulation is required to maintain selective constraint on this locus.

discussion
gene duplication is recognized as an important process in evolution. about 40 % of the  <dig>  drosophila genes are duplicates of other genes  <cit> . duplication is often associated with sub-functionalization in which each of the daughter genes adopts part of the function of the parental gene or neo-functionalization in which duplication is at the origin of a novel function  <cit> . gene duplication can lead to the formation of a large gene family. both animals and plants harbor large families of genes devoted to immune defense. immune genes encoding effector or recognition molecules often exist in multiple copies, while genes encoding signaling pathway components are typically single copy  <cit> . it is expected that a large repertoire of immune molecules confer broader recognition and effector capacity as well as more regulatory flexibility in the use of this repertoire. thus, the higher number of genes encoding peptidoglycan recognition proteins or antimicrobial peptides in the fruit fly drosophila compared to the pea aphid can easily be understood by their respective environments: aphids feed on sap, a rather sterile diet, while drosophila feed on rotting fruits swarming with microbes  <cit> . besides these general statements, the raison d’être of the size of an immune gene family remains speculative.

phenoloxidases are rate-limiting enzymes, which determine the extent of melanization, and as such can be considered as effector immune molecules  <cit> . the number of ppo genes is variable among insects, ranging from one in the bee apis mellifera to ten in the mosquito aedes aegypti  <cit> . in this work and in binggeli et al.  <cit> , we have generated loss-of-function mutations in the three ppo genes of drosophila and analyzed the contribution of each of them to immune reactions. our gene deletion and double-mutant analysis allowed us to ascribe specific functions to each of the three ppos. our study confirms that two crystal cell ppos, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  contribute to the bulk of melanization induced by injury, with ppo <dig> immediately available and ppo <dig> being deployed later  <cit> . melanization is one of the most rapid immune responses, as the dark spot is visible as soon as 10 min after injury. this suggests a key role for this mechanism in the early steps of wound healing and pathogen control. this could explain why ppos are rather stored as ready-to-use proteins and not regulated at the transcriptional level. the existence of crystal cells, whose sole reported function so far is melanization, provides drosophila with an efficient way to store and quickly release this key enzyme. recent studies have shown that crystal cells either derive from progenitor blood cells or can differentiate from plasmatocytes  <cit> . thus, drosophila can indirectly modulate the amount of ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> by regulating crystal cell differentiation. the observation that the ppo <dig> deletion does not affect crystals in crystal cells led us to propose that ppo <dig> is the main source of crystalline ppo and that ppo <dig> is either localized in the cytoplasm of crystal cells or continuously secreted into the hemolymph  <cit> . the extreme fragility of crystal cells did not allow us to clarify this point.

our work here demonstrates that ppo <dig> is restricted to lamellocytes and contributes to the encapsulation of a wasp egg. this explains why the ppo <dig> transcripts are present at barely detectable levels in unchallenged larvae, which contain few or no lamellocytes. an intriguing observation is that two ppos, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  contribute to the melanization of the capsule formed around a wasp egg. this means that it is achieved by phenoloxidases derived from two hemocyte types: crystal cells and lamellocytes. lamellocytes are large flat cells with adhesive properties that can bind to wasp eggs and form multilayers. our study suggests that crystal cells could also be guided to the capsule where they would release ppo <dig> crystals close to the encapsulated egg. it is still unknown whether crystal cells have the ability to stick to non-self elements or if they need the assistance of other hemocytes to reach their target as suggested by  <cit> . the absence of any marked role of ppo <dig> in encapsulation is puzzling. we speculate that localization of ppo <dig> in the hemolymph, which remains to be assessed, could explain why ppo <dig> is not involved in encapsulation. ppo in circulation would not have the ability to be directed to a foreign element such as a wasp egg, but could be immediately activated by the presence of oxygen at a wound site.

combining the various mutations allowed us to show that, while each single ppo mutant has a specific phenotype, knocking out two genes out of three is required to abolish fully a specific function. thus, drosophila ppos have partially overlapping functions to optimize melanization in at least two stress conditions, injury and parasitization . future studies should investigate the role of these ppos in the melanization of organs such as the gut, salivary gland and trachea, which is sometimes observed upon oral infection or in a tumorous-like state  <cit> . the selective pressure exerted by parasitoid wasps on d. melanogaster has probably led to the development of dedicated cellular immune defenses, with the emergence of inducible adhesive cells with ppo <dig> , storage cells  and hematopoietic organs . all these elements are activated upon parasitization and contribute collectively to capsule formation by mechanisms that are still poorly understood  <cit> .fig.  <dig> model of phenoloxidase activation after injury and wasp infestation. both ppo <dig> and  <dig> are synthetized by crystal cells. in the unchallenged condition, ppo <dig> is stored in the crystal cells while the localization of ppo <dig> is still unknown  . after a clean or septic injury, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are the only source of hemolymphatic po activity . after parasitic infestation, ppo <dig> is produced by lamellocytes and contributes with ppo <dig> to the melanization around the wasp egg during encapsulation . uc unchallenged



most drosophila species possess two ppo genes, ppo <dig> and ppo <dig>  except for some species from the d. melanogaster group , which have three . since the ppo <dig> gene sequence, structure and function are more similar to those of ppo <dig> than of ppo <dig>  we propose that a duplication of an ancestral ppo2-like gene gave rise to an ancestral ppo3-like gene in the common ancestor of the lineage leading to d. eugracilis and the d. melanogaster subgroup. this was followed by a functional diversification with ppo <dig> maintaining expression in crystal cells and ppo <dig> becoming expressed only in lamellocytes. this scenario is consistent with a period of accelerated evolution of the ppo <dig> lineage after duplication . future studies in other drosophila species might shed light on whether this gene duplication event led to sub-functionalization  or neo-functionalization . the observation that the existence of a third ppo is restricted to the d. melanogaster group suggests that massive production of po emerged as a crucial mechanism to reinforce the defense against parasitoids in this lineage. the same selective pressure has probably led to other anti-parasite defenses. recent studies have shown that wasp encapsulation in d. ananassae  is mediated by another mechanism involving multinucleated giant hemocytes, that are formed by the aggregation of hemocytes  <cit> . the capsule around the wasp is not melanized in this species  <cit> . the melanization of the capsule points to a critical role of melanization against parasites. this is also supported by studies showing that virulent wasps have suppressive mechanism against melanization, such as the injection of serpins  <cit> . we performed survival analysis with ppo mutants using a highly virulent wasp species, l. boulardi, and a weakly virulent one, l. clavipes. the results did not reveal any striking effect although there was a trend for a lower resistance of larvae to l. clavipes infestation in the absence of ppo . consistent with this, we noticed that it is easier to cultivate the wasp asobara tabida using ppo <dig> , <dig> flies compared to wild type. taking possible effects of the genetic backgrounds into consideration, the results of our survival analysis in the laboratory should be taken with caution. it is possible that the optimum level of melanization for successful encapsulation changes in an ongoing arms race requiring a very tight balance, as melanization is also toxic for flies. this would explain why ppo <dig> mutants tend to be more susceptible than ppo <dig> , <dig> deficient flies upon infection with l. clavipes . thus, the relevance of ppo in wasp encapsulation requires further analysis that should take into account the influence of the genetic background and the use of a more natural setting of infection.

the mechanisms of activation of ppo in drosophila are not yet fully understood. previous studies suggested that ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> require cleavage by sps while ppo <dig> would be constitutively active. indeed over-expression of ppo <dig> is sufficient to induce melanization of tissues as diverse as the eye or the salivary gland  <cit> . here, we show that mutations in hayan or sp <dig> strongly reduce melanization due to septic injury but do not affect melanization around a wasp capsule. this suggests that either ppo <dig> does not require proteolytic cleavage, as suggested by molecular modeling and in vitro testing of ppo <dig> mutants  <cit> , or its maturation requires distinct sps. interestingly in this context, heat treatment of wasp-infected larvae produced melanized cell aggregates, which corresponds to ppo <dig> activity in lamellocytes. this indicates that ppo <dig> is present in lamellocytes in an inactive form that can be activated by heat. thus, the possibilities are that ppo <dig> needs an additional step to be activated, it is produced together with an inhibitor, or it is inactive due to the absence of its substrate. the mechanism by which ppo <dig> is activated only in lamellocytes around a capsule remains to be deciphered.

this analysis started with the serendipitous discovery of a ppo <dig> deletion in the ppo <dig> ppo <dig> double-mutant fly stock. since this deletion was also found in a white control stock, we assume that this mutation was introduced when backcrossing ppo <dig>  since fly stocks in the laboratory are cultivated in the absence of parasitoid pressure, it cannot be excluded that this gene quickly pseudogenizes as it has no role beyond encapsulation. we were fortunate that the presence of this mutation does not affect the main conclusion of binggeli et al.  <cit> , which states that ppo <dig> and ppo <dig> are responsible for all hemolymphatic po activity. the absence of melanization around the wasp egg in ppo1Δ,2Δ, larvae led us to miss the important contribution of ppo <dig> to encapsulation. this underlines that one of the main issues in generating an extensive characterization of the drosophila immune system is that of the genetic background and namely what we refer to as ‘wild type’. fly geneticists have usually a number of ways to assess the effect of the genetic background by analyzing the phenotype caused by mutations in different contexts. this can be done by placing the mutation over a deficiency or by extensive backcrossing to generate isogenic stocks as recently described in  <cit> . an important task should be to analyze how the studied phenotype varies in diverse backgrounds. in this study, the phenotypes of each of the ppo single mutations were clear enough and in accordance with their expression patterns, so that we could be confident about their respective functions. the striking phenotypes of ppo1Δ,2Δ and ppo2Δ, <dig> double mutants, which fail to melanize upon injury and wasp infection, respectively, reinforced our conclusions, which would have been more difficult to draw from only single-mutant analysis. thus, generation of multiple mutations in combination is an adequate approach to assess better the function of gene families, notably those involved in effector mechanisms. similar studies on other immune gene families should provide insights into the organization of the drosophila immune system and that of other organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that differences in spatial localization, immediate or late availability, and mode of activation underlie the functional diversification of the three drosophila ppos, with each of them having non-redundant but overlapping functions.
