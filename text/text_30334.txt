BACKGROUND
nitric oxide  is a highly reactive signaling molecule and inflammatory mediator, which acts as a cytotoxic agent and modulates immune responses and inflammation  <cit> . high amounts of no are produced for prolonged times by inducible nitric oxide synthase  in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial products  <cit> . inos expression is regulated both at transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. several transcription factors which regulate inos promoter activity have been characterized, but the mechanisms and factors regulating inos mrna stability are largely unknown  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinases  are a family of serine/threonine kinases that are part of the signal transduction pathways, which connect inflammatory and various other extracellular signals to intracellular responses e.g. gene expression  <cit> . p <dig> mapk and c-jun n-terminal kinase  are members of the mapk family, and they are activated by chemical and physical stress. p <dig> and jnk regulate immune responses and expression of various cytokines e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig>  <cit> .

jnk and p <dig> mapk are also involved in regulation of inos expression. previous studies have shown that jnk pathway belongs to the factors that mediate the up-regulation of inos expression  <cit> . depending on the cell-type and stimulation used, p <dig> mapk has been reported to have either up-regulatory role  <cit> , down-regulatory role  <cit>  or no role  <cit>  in inos expression. we have previously reported that p <dig> mapk inhibitors enhance inos expression and no production in lps-stimulated j <dig> macrophages  <cit> . the detailed mechanism behind those stimulatory effects is not known.

the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism by which p <dig> inhibition leads to increase in no production. the results suggest that inhibition of p <dig> mapk increases lps-induced jnk activity, which leads to stabilisation of inos mrna and increased production of no in activated macrophages.

RESULTS
p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> increases lps-induced no production and inos expression
we have previously shown that pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p <dig> mapk sb <dig>  <cit>  stimulates lps-induced no production  <cit> . sb <dig> is a recently developed potent and specific inhibitor of p <dig> mapk with an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm in kinase activity assay  <cit> . figure 1a shows that sb <dig> had a concentration dependent stimulatory effect on lps-induced no production and maximal effect  was achieved at drug concentration of  <dig>  μm. the effect of sb <dig> was similar to the effect of sb <dig>  . a structurally related control compound sb <dig>  which does not inhibit p <dig> mapk  <cit> , had no effect on no production. the stimulatory effect of sb <dig> was maximal when the compound was added to cells  <dig> h after lps . this result is in line with our previous report in which we showed that the stimulatory effect of sb <dig> was maximal when the compound was added  <dig> h after lps  <cit> . the levels of activated p <dig> peaked in  <dig> min after lps, were still high at  <dig> h and declined gradually thereafter so that activated p <dig> could be detected even  <dig> h after lps . thus, the stimulation of lps-induced inos production by sb <dig> could result from inhibition of p <dig>  even when the compound was added to cells 1– <dig> h after lps. sb <dig> had a clear stimulatory effect also on inos protein expression, whereas the negative control compound sb <dig> had no effect . interestingly, sb <dig> did not increase lps-induced inos mrna levels when measured  <dig> h after addition of lps, whereas a 100% increase in inos mrna levels was observed when measured  <dig> h after addition of lps .

sb <dig> stabilises inos mrna
because sb <dig> had no effect on inos mrna levels when measured  <dig> h after lps, but significantly increased the mrna levels when measured  <dig> h after lps, we hypothesized that sb <dig> might stabilize inos mrna.

to study the effect of sb <dig> on the stability of inos mrna, the cells were treated with lps or lps+sb <dig> and cells were incubated for  <dig> h. thereafter total rna was isolated at  <dig> h intervals. the inos mrna levels in cells were reducing rapidly between 6– <dig> h after lps stimulation. the amount of inos mrna in lps treated cells halved in about  <dig> h . the reduction in the amount of inos mrna was slower in cells treated with lps+sb <dig> .

actinomycin d  was added to cells  <dig> h after lps in an attempt to test whether the slowed disappearance of inos mrna in cells treated with lps+sb <dig> was due to increased rate of transcription of inos gene or reduced degradation of mrna. interestingly, the level of mrna was reducing at the same or slower rate in cells treated with lps+actinomycin d compared with cells treated with lps only, suggesting that no significant transcription of inos gene occurs in cells  <dig> –  <dig> h after lps stimulation and that actinomycin d itself inhibits the degradation of inos mrna. thus, the slowed disappearance of inos mrna in cells treated with sb <dig> was most likely due to reduced degradation of mrna.

p38α and p38β expression in j <dig> macrophages
there are four known isoforms of p <dig> mapk   <cit> , and sb <dig> has been shown to inhibit p38α and p38β but not p38γ and p38δ isoforms  <cit> . p38α and p38β have been recently reported to differently regulate inos expression  <cit> . therefore we wanted to investigate whether j <dig>  macrophages express p38α and p38β isoenzymes.

we used real-time rt-pcr to study the p38α and p38β mrna expression in j <dig>  macrophages. both unstimulated and lps stimulated cells expressed p38α mrna at relatively high level as compared to gapdh mrna . in contrast, only low level expression of p38β mrna was detected. in line with the mrna result, western blot showed p38α protein expression , whereas no p38β protein could be detected by western blotting.

sb <dig> increases lps-induced jnk activity
opposite roles for p <dig> mapk and jnk have recently been reported on thrombin induced inos expression in raw <dig>  macrophages  <cit> . jnk and p <dig> mapk have common target proteins and there is crosstalk between these signaling cascades  <cit> . furthermore, we have previously reported that jnk inhibition destabilizes inos mrna  <cit> . therefore we hypothesized that the roles of jnk and p <dig> mapk pathways on lps-induced inos expression may be coupled. we continued by investigating whether inhibition of p <dig> mapk modulates the activity of jnk.

lps induced a rapid phosphorylation of jnk. the phosphorylation peaked at  <dig>  h and declined rapidly thereafter, remaining <33% of the maximum when measured 2– <dig> h after lps . sb <dig>  when given  <dig> h after lps, further increased the lps-induced jnk phosphorylation compared with cells treated with lps only. in sb220025-treated cells the amount of phosphorylated jnk remained >55% of the maximum level up to  <dig> h and declined thereafter. sb <dig> alone did not activate jnk .

jnk phosphorylates c-jun at residues ser <dig> and ser <dig>  <cit> . in parallel to increased phosphorylation of jnk by sb <dig>  increased phosphorylation of c-jun at ser <dig> was observed . similar results were obtained when phosphorylation of ser <dig> was measured . this suggests that the increased phosphorylation of jnk resulted in functionally significant increase in the activity of jnk.

to rule out the possibility, that increased c-jun phosphorylation was a result of reduced dephosphorylation, we tested whether the effect of sb <dig> could be reversed with jnk inhibitor sp <dig>  treatment with lps and sb <dig> induced a  <dig> fold increase in c-jun ser <dig> phosphorylation compared with cells treated with lps only . in contrast, the negative control compound sb <dig> had no effect on c-jun phosphorylation. the sb220025-stimulated increase in c-jun phosphorylation was almost completely reversed by sp <dig>  suggesting that the increase in c-jun phosphorylation was due to increased jnk activity and not due to reduced dephosphorylation.

the stimulatory effect of sb <dig> on lps-induced no production and inos mrna expression can be reversed by sp600125
to continue, we hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of sb <dig> on lps-induced no production was due to increased jnk activity and therefore we tested the effect of jnk inhibitor sp <dig> on sb220025-stimulated no production.

sb <dig> induced a clear increase in lps-stimulated no production, whereas sp <dig> inhibited no production . however, when cells were treated with a combination of sb <dig> and sp <dig> the level of no production was comparable to levels produced by cells treated with lps+sp <dig>  thus, the effect of sb <dig> was reversed by sp <dig> 

the same result was observed at the level of inos mrna expression. sb <dig> increased the amounts of inos mrna to almost two fold compared with cells treated with lps only, whereas the negative control compound sb <dig> had no effect . sp <dig> alone reduced the lps-stimulated inos mrna levels slightly. in addition, in the presence of the jnk inhibitor sp <dig>  sb <dig> had no stimulatory effect on inos mrna levels.

cycloheximide increases jnk activity and inos mrna expression
cycloheximide is widely used as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. however, cycloheximide also activates jnk  <cit> . therefore we continued by investigating whether cycloheximide has similar effect on inos mrna expression as sb <dig>  cycloheximide at  <dig> – <dig>  μg/ml concentrations increased lps-induced jnk activity . interestingly, cycloheximide had no significant effect on inos mrna expression when measured  <dig> h after lps, but increased inos mrna levels > <dig> fold when measured  <dig> h after lps . furthermore, the effect of cycloheximide on inos mrna expression was partially inhibited by sp <dig> . these results show that the effect of cycloheximide on jnk activity and inos expression were very similar to the effect of sb <dig> 

discussion
in the present study we have shown that inhibition of p <dig> mapk by sb <dig> increases lps-induced jnk activity, which leads to stabilization of inos mrna and increased inos expression and no production in j <dig>  macrophages.

inhibitors of p <dig> mapk have been shown to up-regulate inos expression in il-1β-stimulated rat mesangial cells  <cit> , in lps+ifn-γ-stimulated raw <dig> γ macrophages  <cit> , in interferon-γ +mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-stimulated raw <dig> γ macrophages  <cit>  and in lps-stimulated j <dig> a <dig> macrophages  <cit> . in this study, a novel p <dig> mapk inhibitor sb <dig> increased lps-induced no production with an ec <dig> of ~ <dig> nm, which is close to its ic <dig> value of p <dig> mapk inhibition   <cit> . furthermore, a structurally related inactive control compound sb <dig> had no effect. these results together suggest that the observed increase in no production and inos expression was due to inhibition of p <dig> mapk. sb <dig> inhibits the p38α and p38β isoforms at equipotent efficiency, but does not inhibit p38γ or p38δ  <cit> . to our knowledge there is no published data about the isoform specificity of sb <dig>  in the present study both sb <dig> and sb <dig> had similar effect on lps-induced no production, thus it is likely that the observed effects are mediated by p38α and/or p38β. j <dig> macrophages were found to express p38α mrna and p38α protein at relatively high levels whereas only low amounts of p38β mrna were detected. similar pattern of p38α and p38β expression was reported by lui et al.  in rat renal mesangial cells, in which p <dig> mapk inhibition was also found to increase inos expression. in their further transfection experiments, lui et al.  found that p38α mutant and p38β wild-type isoforms inhibited il-1-induced inos expression suggesting that the two isoforms have reciprocal effects on inos expression in renal mesangial cells. our results show that inhibition of p <dig> enhances inos expression and no production in macrophages activated by lps but further studies are required to clarify the roles of different p <dig> mapk isoforms in that process.

the mechanisms how p <dig> mapk inhibitors enhance inos expression and no production have been unclear. the present data suggest that inhibition of p <dig> enhances jnk activity that results in stabilization of inos mrna and enhanced inos protein expression. our results are in line with those of avdi et al.  in which inhibition of p <dig> mapk by sb <dig> led to increased activity of jnk in human neutrophils  <cit> . the inhibition of p <dig> mapk was found to reduce the activity of protein phosphatase-2a which resulted in reduced dephosphorylation and increased activity of jnk. various protein phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate mapks and are thus important regulators of mapk activity  <cit> . it is possible that p <dig> mapk regulates the activity of protein phosphatase-2a or some other protein phosphatase and inhibition of p <dig> mapk by sb <dig> reduces protein phosphatase activity, which leads to increased jnk activity observed in the present study. interestingly, we found that jnk inhibitor sp <dig> reversed the sb <dig> stimulated increase in jnk activity, no production and inos expression, suggesting that increased inos expression by sb <dig> results from increased jnk activity. in addition, cycloheximide, a known jnk activator, also increased lps-induced inos mrna expression in a similar manner as sb <dig>  the stimulatory effect of cycloheximide on inos mrna expression was reversed by sp <dig>  suggesting that the effect of cycloheximide is at least partially mediated through increased jnk activity. up-regulatory role for jnk in inos expression has been previously shown in il-1+ifn-γ-stimulated human fetal astrocytes  <cit> , in lps+ifn-γ-stimulated raw <dig> γ macrophages  <cit> , il-1β-stimulated rat primary mesangial cells  <cit> and lps-stimulated j <dig> a <dig> macrophages  <cit> .

regulation of inos mrna stability seems to be an important mean to regulate inos expression. however, the mechanisms regulating inos mrna stability are poorly known. hur is a mrna stabilizing factor, which has been shown to bind an au-rich sequence element in the 3' untranslated region of human inos mrna and to stabilise inos mrna  <cit> . tristetraprolin seems to have a role as a mrna stabilizing factor for human inos  <cit>  while the kh-type splicing regulatory protein  has been identified as a destabilizing factor  <cit> . heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins i and l have been reported to interact with murine inos mrna  <cit> . in addition, dexamethasone  <cit> , protein kinase cδ  <cit>  and β-adrenergic stimulation  <cit>  have been shown to regulate inos mrna stability. recently, we have shown that jnk inhibitor sp <dig> reduces inos mrna stability  <cit> . in the present study, treatment with sb <dig> had no effect on inos mrna levels when measured  <dig> h after lps stimulation, whereas a two fold increase in mrna levels was observed  <dig> h after lps. furthermore, mrna levels decreased slower in sb <dig> treated cells than in cells treated with lps alone. these results together suggest that sb <dig> increases inos mrna expression by stabilising mrna. also actinomycin d seems to have a stabilising effect on inos mrna. actinomycin d has previously been reported to stabilise mrnas of transferrin receptor  <cit>  and cyclooxygenase- <dig>  <cit>  but the mechanisms are not known in detail.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results show that inhibition of p <dig> mapk enhances jnk activity, which leads to stabilisation of inos mrna, and to increased inos expression and no production. p <dig> mapk regulates activity of jnk pathway and it is therefore important to consider whether results obtained by inhibiting p <dig> mapk might result from increased jnk activity rather than from reduced p <dig> mapk activity directly. finally, based on our results, it seems that jnk is an important post-transcriptional regulator of lps-induced inos expression and no production.
