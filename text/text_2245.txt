BACKGROUND
because of the high sensitivity, mass spectrometry has been widely used for protein identification and characterization in proteome researches within the past decade <cit> . shotgun proteome approach, which is based on analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry , can be applied to analyze complex protein mixtures directly even without any prior purification step. large-scale proteome profiling using multidimensional lc-ms/ms has become increasingly applied for the analysis of many biological samples, including various mammalian tissues, cell lines, and serum/plasma  <cit> . in shotgun proteomics, complex protein mixtures are first digested by the enzyme  to produce peptide mixtures. then the peptide mixtures are subjected to extensive separations such as strong cation exchange chromatography  coupling with on-line or off-line reversed-phase capillary lc . peptides eluting from the reversed phase capillary lc column are sprayed into tandem mass spectrometer to produce ms/ms spectra. and then peptide sequences are assigned to experimental ms/ms spectra by database searching algorithm.

sequest <cit> , mascot <cit>  and other database searching algorithms match experimental spectra with theoretical spectra which are generated from peptide sequences in silico, and then calculate scores to evaluate how well they match. these scores help discriminating between correct and incorrect peptide assignments. one of the major issues in database search for proteome analysis is to determine the false-discovery rate  of the identifications. fdr is the rate at which significant identifications are actually null <cit> . a variety of methods were developed to determine fdr for peptide identifications. some efforts have been made on establishing statistical analysis methods  <cit>  to determine the possibility of positive identifications, e.g. peptideprophet <cit> . complicated statistical algorithms are often needed in these methods. another simpler way to evaluate fdr is using decoy proteome approach which was introduced by peng et al <cit> . determination of fdr in this method is based on the database searching using a composite database including original protein database and its reversed version. statistically, the probability that a peptide is identified incorrectly from reversed database is expected to be same as the probability that it is identified incorrectly from original protein database as the sizes of reversed database and original database are the same  <cit> . therefore, fdr can be calculated using the following equation:

 fdr = 2*n/+n),  

where n and n are the number of peptides identified in proteins with forward  and reversed sequences, respectively <cit> . the database searching strategy using composite database is also known as reversed database searching strategy. because of the simple usage, it has been widely used in the evaluation of proteomic search results <cit>  including post-translation modification  researches <cit> .

sequest <cit>  is one of the commonly used database searching algorithms. it first counts the peaks which are common in experimental and theoretical spectra, and computes a preliminary score . then it selects a proportion of top candidate peptides based on the rank of preliminary score  for cross-correlation analysis. so, for each candidate peptide identification, several scores and rankings are determined. to distinguish correct identifications from incorrect identifications, filters using a set of database searching scores are applied, including two commonly used scores, xcorr and Δcn. in order to evaluate fdr of the identifications, reversed database searching could be performed and the fdr could be determined by equation . to control fdr, many research groups usually use fixed xcorr values and manually increase Δcn to get peptide identifications with specific fdr <cit> , or use a fixed Δcn value and manually increase of xcorr scores  <cit> . however, these new criteria which were determined by adjusting only one score filter to reach a specific fdr may be not optimal.

genetic algorithm  belongs to evolutionary algorithms and applies natural selection process, where better fitted species are selected. the optimization process of this algorithm is based on multi-point-search for which many solutions are calculated simultaneously <cit> . if the fitness function is properly designed, ga has the ability to search through very large sets of possible solutions and converge to an optimal or near optimal solution quite quickly. it has been successfully applied to process ms data in proteome researches  <cit> .

in this work, we combined the decoy database searching approach with automated filter criteria optimization, and developed a software suite named sfoer  using ga which enables simultaneous optimization of multiple sequest score filtering criteria. the optimized criteria were used to filter datasets which were generated from two different human samples and resulted in approximate 20% increase of peptide identifications than that using conventional criteria <cit>  while fdr were kept the same . direct comparison between sfoer and peptideprophet has been performed using both complex human samples and standard protein mixtures. compared with peptideprophet, sfoer showed nearly same ability in distinguishing correct peptide identifications from incorrect ones with only 1/ <dig> of the processing time. and because sfoer doesn't rely on models which are based on possible unfounded assumptions, it provides a safe way for fast determination of tailored optimal filtering criteria for different proteome samples, thus, higher proteome coverage can be achieved.

RESULTS
to evaluate the confidence of peptide assignments by sequest and generate the score distribution for peptide identifications, we have generated large datasets of human proteome samples by scx/rplc-ms/ms <cit> . approximately  <dig>  ms/ms spectra were generated from human liver tissue lysate. all ms/ms spectra were searched by sequest against a composite database containing human ipi proteins in both forward and reversed orientation. herein only the top matched peptide from a spectrum with specific charge state was accepted. approximate  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  peptides according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+ were finally generated.  <dig>   peptides were derived from reversed protein database and  <dig>   were from forward protein database.

true and false assignment distribution
to investigate whether it was necessary to optimize the filtering criteria after sequest database search, we first investigated the distribution of peptides identified from forward protein database and reversed protein database. the distributions of peptides with different xcorr and Δcn values are shown in figure 1a, 1b and 1c according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, respectively. evidently, peptides with reversed sequences  centralized at the region with low xcorr and Δcn scores, which indicated that peptide assignments with sequest scores lying in this region were more likely to be random matches. and in the region where xcorr scores were high enough, there was nearly no peptide with reversed sequence, and Δcn scores of peptides in this region were always high. therefore, peptides which were identified with high xcorr and Δcn scores were more likely to be true assignments.

to obtain confident identifications with specific fdr , filter criteria with two sequest scores, xcorr and Δcn, need to be adjusted. a series of filtering criteria using these two cutoff scores can be determined in this way: xcorr cutoff scores were increased by a specific value  step by step, and Δcn cutoff scores were decided accordingly with the xcorr cutoff values for the aim that identifications passed the filtering criterion had an overall fdr less than 1%. cumulate curves of these filters determined above were shown in each graph of figure  <dig> according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, and every point on each curve indicated a set of criteria leading to fdr < 1% for peptide identifications with a specific charge state. these curves indicated that to achieve peptide identifications with fdr less than 1%, various criteria can be used.

to demonstrate the dependence of the number of identified peptides on the application of different filter criteria at same fdr , relation between the number of identified peptides and xcorr cutoff values in different criteria which result in these identifications is shown in figure  <dig>  evidently, the number of peptide identifications changed greatly when criteria with different xcorr cutoffs were used. for example, as shown by curve c in figure  <dig>  the number of identified doubly charged peptides was  <dig>  when criterion with xcorr cutoff value of  <dig>  was used, but this number changed to  <dig>  when criterion with xcorr value of  <dig>  was used. approximately 20% difference in number of peptide identifications between these two sets of criteria was observed. in addition, to reach fdr < 1%, Δcn cutoff values of these two criteria were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. according to above results, simultaneous optimization of different sequest score combinations for filtering criteria can result in more positive peptide identifications and reduce false-negative detections which are true assignments but may be rejected by conventional filtering criteria while confidence levels keep the same.

optimization of filtering criteria by genetic algorithm
our aim of this study was to develop an approach to optimize the filtering criteria which maximized the number of peptide identifications without increase of fdr. to achieve this purpose, genetic algorithm <cit>  was used to develop a java software suite named sfoer which took sequest scores such as xcorr, Δcn etc. as its weights and number of peptide identifications as its scale. fitness was calculated using equation . the optimization was composed of  <dig> generations. each generation had  <dig> individuals, and these individuals were of three types, one came from parents, another which contained combined information from two parents was generated by the cross-over of individuals in current generation, and the third was the "mutant" one which contained new introduced information. probabilities of mutation and cross-over were set to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. each individual contained four genes including xcorr, Δcn, sp and rsp. limit of fdr was set to 1%. after optimization, the resulting fittest individual was considered to be the optimized set of weights. since the distributions of sequest scores for different charge states are different as shown in figure  <dig>  optimization of filtering criteria for different charges states were conducted independently. details of criterion optimization for peptides with double charge state are represented in figure  <dig>  as the convergence was obtained over the first  <dig> generations, we allowed ga to continue to evolve another  <dig> generations for further improvement of the optimization.

on the basis of above ga optimization procedure, sfoer was utilized to optimize the filtering criteria for dataset generated from human liver tissue lysate. finally, we got the following optimized criteria : according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, xcorr scores should be bigger than  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , Δcn should be bigger than  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , sp should be bigger than  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and rsp should be within  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  filtered by this set of criteria,  <dig>  positive peptides were generated, including  <dig> singly charged peptides,  <dig>  doubly charged peptides and  <dig>  triply charged peptides.

to evaluate the performance of this set of optimized filtering criteria, we then compared it with the conventional criteria <cit> . similar to them, criteria were determined as follows: xcorr cutoffs were set as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for singly, doubly and triply charged peptides and Δcn cutoff was determined by the increase of its value until fdr for peptide identifications was less than 1%. finally the Δcn cutoff was determined to be  <dig>  for the human liver tissue dataset. when above criteria were applied,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  singly, doubly and triply charged peptides were identified. using the filtering criteria optimized in this study, there was an  <dig> % increase of peptide identifications  with same fdr  after combining the results of all charge states. and  <dig> % more unique peptides  were generated by the optimized criteria .

a. summary of each category returned by different strategies: #1+, #2+ and #3+ indicates the number of peptide identifications for charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+ respectively. #total =  +  + . #false pep indicates the number of peptides from reversed database, while #unique pep is the number of total unique peptides. increase of peptide identifications  and unique peptide identifications  by sfoer and peptideprophet are shown. #proteins are the number of positive proteins identified by the strategies. fdr of identifications are also shown.

b. conventional criteria. xcorr >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for singly, doubly and triply charged peptides, respectively and Δcn >  <dig>  for all charge states  <cit> .

c. cutoff is set as peptideprophet probability >  <dig>   <cit> .

d. optimized criteria determined by sfoer are: according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, xcorr scores >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , Δcn >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , sp >  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and rsp <  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

when the optimization was performed on another very different sample, human blood plasma, different set of optimal filtering criteria was generated. according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, xcorr scores should be bigger than  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , Δcn should be bigger than  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , sp should be bigger than  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and rsp should be within  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  filtered by this set of criteria,  <dig>  peptides were generated. and there was an  <dig> % increase of peptide identifications than those resulted from conventional criteria  <cit> .

evidently, optimized criteria for datasets from these two different human samples were different even with same separation and analysis conditions . while the optimized xcorr cutoffs for datasets from these two samples were almost the same , other score and ranking cutoffs were quite different: according to the charge states of 1+, 2+ and 3+, these cutoffs for human liver tissue were Δcn >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , sp >  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  and rsp rankings should be within  <dig>   <dig> and 2; but for human blood plasma, these cutoffs were Δcn >  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , sp should be bigger than  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and rsp should be within  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  similar phenomena have also been observed by smith and colleagues <cit> , and they attributed this to the different protein abundances in different samples.

in most cases, the differences on proteome analysis were inevitable: protein samples may come from different tissues or even different species, mass spectra may be collected by different type of mass spectrometers under different separation conditions and so on. these differences will result in the generation of datasets with different characteristics. statistical approaches based on training with some assumptions on one type of dataset may only work well on datasets with that particular type. however, for other type of datasets with different characteristics, these approaches may need retraining or redesign. while sfoer does not employ any statistical method and no training was required. so sfoer can be applied to process any database search results as long as the searches were performed against decoy database where fdr could be easily determined. by using this ga based software suite, optimized criteria for different datasets can be easily determined, and these tailored optimal criteria should be very effective to improve the coverage for proteome analysis.

discrimination powers of the filtering criteria optimized by sfoer with different combinations of sequest scores were also evaluated. the numbers of peptide identifications from liver tissue sample by applying these filtering criteria are shown in table  <dig>  for filtering criteria using three cutoff scores, the one using rsp, xcorr and Δcn yielded more peptide identifications than that using sp, xcorr and Δcn. and the number of identified peptides by using the first set of criteria was very close to that obtained by the optimized criteria using all four scores. thus, sp scores had less important contribution to the discrimination than rsp did. compared to the optimized criteria using all four scores, criteria using only two commonly used scores were also effective in reducing false-negative peptide identifications as only  <dig> % decrease of peptide identifications were observed. this indicated that commonly used criteria which consisted of two cutoff scores, xcorr and Δcn, were effective in proteome researches, but if wanting to get higher proteome coverage, optimized criteria using other sequest scores and rankings were needed.

classification performance of sfoer
peptideprophet is a statistical approach, based on the expectation maximization algorithm , for validation of peptide identifications made by tandem mass spectrometry and database searching <cit> . database search results for human liver and plasma samples were also processed by peptideprophet. probability thresholds of  <dig>  were set for which empirical error rates for these two datasets were  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively <cit> . and the corresponding fdr were determined as  <dig> % and  <dig> % for these two datasets by employing reversed database searching strategy. there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  peptides identified by peptideprophet for liver tissue sample and plasma sample, respectively. compared with peptideprophet, the numbers of peptides identified for the two human proteome samples by sfoer were nearly the same . there was  <dig> % overlap of the peptide identifications between peptideprophet and sfoer, which means majority of the identified peptides were same for both approaches . detail comparison of the performances on human liver lysate between conventional criteria, peptideprophet and sfoer is shown in table  <dig>  the total numbers of identified proteins are also given in table  <dig>  because of the increase of peptide identifications, the protein identifications also increased obviously when sfoer was used.

compared with the conventional approach, the numbers of identified peptides increased significantly when the filtering criteria optimized by sfoer were applied. a concern for this is that whether the increased peptide identifications are true identifications. for datasets from human liver tissue sample,  <dig>  extra peptide identifications were achieved when the filtering criteria optimized by sfoer were applied. it is impossible to manually validate all of these peptide identifications. a practical way is to randomly select small portion of the increased peptide identifications and manually check with their spectra. thus  <dig> out of from  <dig>  extra peptides identifications were randomly selected. each of these spectra was assessed for acceptable signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of at least three consecutive b or y ion fragments <cit> . finally  <dig> %  of these peptides were true positive and the false-discovery rate was very close to the overall predicted fdr. it was found that 84%  of the increased peptides can also be detected by peptideprophet at a probability cutoff of  <dig>  for which the empirical error rate was  <dig> %. above results clearly demonstrated that the additional peptide identifications obtained by sfoer were quite confident. .

classification performance of sfoer was further validated by standard protein mixture. tryptic digest of seven standard proteins was selected as the sample. and the acquired ms/ms spectra were searched against a composite database containing both forward and reversed sequences of all control proteins  as well as forward and reversed protein sequences from yeast, chosen for its low homology with readily available control proteins. because the proteins present in the sample were known, correct and incorrect peptide assignments can be easily distinguished by the rule whether it is from known standard proteins. thus actual fdr, i.e. the observed fdr, can be determined by the percentage of peptide identifications not from standard proteins among all peptide identifications, while predicted fdr was determined by equation . if not otherwise stated, fdr refers to the predicted fdr. the classification performance of sfoer could be evaluated by comparing the actual and predicted fdr.

lc-ms/ms analyses of  <dig> standard protein mixture digest resulted in a collection of  <dig>  spectra. performance of sfoer was also compared with that of peptideprophet using this standard protein dataset. a series sets of filtering criteria were optimized by sfoer with fdr increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . then peptide identifications with different confidence levels were generated by utilizing these optimized criteria. for peptideprophet, manual adjustment of the probability threshold was used to generate peptide identifications with different fdr. the number of correct peptide identifications  and the number of incorrect peptide identifications  are shown in figure 5a. with the increase of fdr, sfoer showed nearly same performance with peptideprophet except a slight improvement in the number of correct peptide identifications. and peptideprophet showed a small increase of power in trading-off incorrect peptide identifications. plot in figure 5b are the observed fdr as function of the predicted fdr. it can be seen that the observed and predicted fdr matched very well for both sfoer and peptideprophet. however, small increases of observed fdr were found for both cases. this probably because that our evaluation method didn't take commonly contaminants such as keratins into account. on the basis of above results, reversed database searching algorithm essentially provided a reasonable estimation of the actual error. the optimization by sfoer based on reversed database strategy was reasonable and fdr of peptide identifications evaluated by reversed database strategy can essentially reflect the actual fdr.

ga is a very efficient algorithm and is widely used in searching for optimal or near optimal solutions. thus, sfoer which employing ga should inherit this advantage. approximately  <dig>  spectra  were processed by peptideprophet and sfoer on a pentium  <dig>  computer separately. the optimization procedure using sfoer took less than  <dig> min , while the procedure for calculation of probability by peptideprophet took about  <dig> min. and the io procedures  took about  <dig> min and  <dig> min for peptideprophet and sfoer, respectively. evidently, sfoer was much faster than peptideprophet for which only 1/ <dig> of time was needed for the searching of optimal criteria .

for model based algorithm like peptideprophet, accuracy relies on the fitness between the empirical model and obtained datasets. if the model accurately reflects the physical processes by which the data are generated, it can work well even for a small amount of training data. on the other hand if the data distributes in a significant way, classification errors proportional to the degree of divergence result. however, sfoer is less risky for that it does not rely on model. the pre-knowledge on the property of the dataset or making assumptions about the dataset is not required. therefore, this approach is equally applicable to many datasets with different characteristics. however, there is one requirement for application of sfoer. as fdr for peptide identification is required during the optimization, sfoer can only process database search results performed with decoy database.

sfoer can also be easily extended to some special applications by slightly revision. currently, sfoer only takes several sequest scores such as xcorr, Δcn, sp and rsp as its weights. it was reported that some peptide properties obtained from the experiments of proteome analysis could be used to increase the confidence of peptide identifications. these properties including the pi values obtained from the isoelectric focusing  <cit> , hydrophobicity or elution times obtained from reversed phase lc separation  <cit> , high accurate masses obtained from using of ft mass spectrometer <cit>  and so on. in principle, these properties as well as sequest scores can be optimized simultaneously for filtering criteria by this software suite. and significant improvement in proteome coverage for proteome analysis is expected. though sfoer was developed to optimize filtering criteria for sequest database search, after slightly revision it should also be easily applied to the optimization of filtering criteria for other database search engines such as mascot as long as the decoy database search strategy is applied.

CONCLUSIONS
a software suite, named as sfoer, was developed using predictive genetic algorithm  to optimize filtering criterion for sequest database searching. the optimization was based on reversed database search where fdr can be easily determined. it was demonstrated that sfoer was able to maximize the number of identified peptides without increase of fdr. compared with statistical approach – peptideprophet, sfoer has nearly the same classification performance but cost much less processing time. moreover, as it did not rely on possibly unfounded assumptions about the data, sfoer can create tailored criteria for datasets which are obtained from different samples, generated from different mass spectrometers, even searched with different database searching algorithms .
