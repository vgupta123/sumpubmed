BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a serious health problem, with  <dig>  million new cases and  <dig>  million deaths reported in  <dig>  <cit> . an understanding of disease pathogenesis could lead to a rational strategy to fight tb. along with the prolonged coevolution with man, the bacillus has developed the ability to neutralize the macrophages , which are usually very efficient to kill intracellular microbes. the adaptive capacity of mycobacteria resides mainly in the cell wall, a structure of high complexity composed of a covalently linked arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan backbone with covalently attached mycolic acids, as well as abundant non-covalently linked lipid components  <cit> . it is known that several of these lipids are capable of blocking the anti-mycobacterial host responses. indeed, virulence of mtb isolates has been associated with the cell wall lipid components. for instance, the high pathogenicity of w/beijing isolates seems to be related to cell wall lipids that upregulate a th <dig> immune response that favors the infection  <cit> . once delipidated, the mycobacteria lose the ability to block the fusion of the phagosome with the lysosome, and total extractable lipids inhibit t-cell and mØ functions  <cit> . peptidoglycan inhibits the macrophage response to ifn-γ at a transcriptional level  <cit> . among the cell wall glycolipids, excels the effects on immune response caused by trehalose- <dig> -dymicolate , which promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production, influences the persistence of mycobacteria within mØ and retards phagosome maturation  <cit> . also important is the lipoarabinomannan, as it regulates phagosome maturation and inhibits acquired immunity  <cit> . we have shown previously that di-o-acylated trehalose , a non-covalently attached mycobacterial cell wall glycolipid, downregulates the proliferation of t cells and the production of cytokines, two essential features of adaptive immunity  <cit> . in this work, we show that dat and its more heavily lipidated homologue, tri-o-acylated trehalose , downregulates the inducible nitric oxide synthase  expression and nitric oxide  production in mØs, which are effector components that are important in the immune response against mycobacteria.

RESULTS
isolation of dat and tat from mycobacterium fortuitum
m. fortuitum has been used as an alternative source of acyl trehaloses, which belong to a lipid family featuring virulent mtb strains  <cit> . non-mycoloyl fatty acylated trehaloses occur in virulent strains of the mtb complex but are either absent or minimally represented in avirulent members of the complex, such as the h37ra mtb isolate or the vaccine strains m. bovis bcg and so <dig>  <cit> . however, dat and tat have been described in m. fortuitum  <cit>  and, taken from this source, they have been found to mimic both antigenicity and immunoregulation activities of the mtb native compounds  <cit> . thin-layer-chromatography analyzes of crude lipid extracts are shown in fig.  <dig>  acid/anthrone reagent was used to display sugar-containing lipids, which developed as blue spots, allowing the identification of two medium-polarity glycosyl-containing lipids in m. fortuitum . according to their mobility in chloroform-methanol  onto the silica gel layer, glycolipids with rf values of  <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  were tentatively identified as dat and tat, respectively . after their purification by column chromatography on florisil and silica-gel solid-phase extraction, the isolated glycolipids were further characterized by fourier transform infra-red  spectroscopy, . both spectra share characteristic bands of glycosylated lipids, as expected. the characteristic band at  <dig> and  <dig> cm− <dig> indicates the presence of an oxygen-hydrogen bond in hydroxyl groups in the sugar moieties of dat y tat, respectively. absorption bands at  <dig> cm− <dig> and  <dig> cm− <dig> were assigned to the symmetric stretch of methylene  and methyl  groups of aliphatic chains, respectively. the peak located at  <dig> cm− <dig> indicates the presence of carboxyl ester groups . finally, the characteristic ftir fingerprint of mycobacterial acylated trehaloses is shown in the region from about  <dig> to  <dig> cm− <dig>  due to all manner of bending vibrations of these molecules, the so-called mycosides f  <cit> . the concentration of endotoxin was measured by the lymulus assay test and was undetectable.fig.  <dig> purification and chemical characterization of dat and tat. thin-layer chromatography of m. fortuitum atcc  <dig> unfractionated lipids showing tat and dat locations . thin-layer chromatography of isolated tat and dat . fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy of dat  and tat  



dat and tat inhibit no production by murine mØs
to analyze the effects of dat and tat on no production in bone marrow-derived mØs, we first established the optimal conditions to carry out the assay. the mØs activated with 500ng of lps released  <dig>  μm/ml of no in  <dig> h. when  <dig> ng of tat were added to the cells, no production was reduced by  <dig>  % . interestingly, the inhibitory effects of tat on no production induced by ifn-γ were higher  . as for the effects of dat, the inhibition of the production of no induced by lps was almost total and up to  <dig>  % in cells activated with ifn-γ .fig.  <dig> dat and tat downregulate no production induced by lps and ifn-γ in bone marrow-derived mØs. the isolated tat or dat were dissolved in hexane/methanol and placed in the wells. after solvent evaporation 1 ×  <dig>  mØs were added to the wells. afterward lps  or ifn-γ  were added to the cells. after  <dig> h, the culture medium was collected, and no was measured by the griess reaction . the percent inhibition of no production induced by tat  and dat  are shown. results of four experiments are presented. data regarding lps against dat/lps was analyzed using an unpaired t-test with welch’s correction to assess the statistical significance *p <  <dig> 



dat and tat inhibit the inos expression in murine mØ
in view of the involvement of inos in the regulation of no production, we studied the effects of dat and tat on inos expression induced either by lps or ifn-γ in bone marrow-derived mØs . these assays showed that tat reduced up to  <dig>  % the expression of inos in cells activated with lps. similarly, the expression of inos in cells activated with ifn-γ was downregulated by tat in  <dig>  % . dat also inhibited the expression of inos in  <dig>  % after activation with lps and  <dig>  % when the cells were stimulated with ifn-γ . western blot analyzes also showed a decreased expression of inos after exposure of mØs to acyl-trehaloses. however, this technique indicated a more pronounced effect on the di-o-acylated molecule .fig.  <dig> dat and tat downregulate inos expression. mØs were treated with the glycolipids and activated with lps or ifn-gamma as described for fig.  <dig>  the expression of inos was analyzed by flow cytometry with permeabilized cells . the percent inhibition of inos is shown . after  <dig> h, the mØs were obtained, lysed and the proteins were electrophoresed and transferred to a pvdf membrane for western blot with a monoclonal antibody to inos . results of four experiments are shown. data regarding lps against dat/lps and inf-γ against dat/ifn- γ, were analyzed with a paired t-test to assess the statistical significance *p <  <dig> 



discussion
no is a bioactive gas produced by mØs activated with inf-γ through the catalytic action of inos  <cit> . the production of no is an important host defense mechanism in mtb infection. mice with disrupted inos genes are highly susceptible to tb and develop progressive disease  <cit> . in murine models of tuberculosis, no is known to enhance the phagosomal maturation, thus promoting macrophage killing of the bacilli  <cit> . the relevance of no for controlling the bacilli in humans remains controversial. however, various data support that the no/inos system plays a role in tuberculosis disease. for instance, mtb triggers the production of no and inos in mØs from both healthy and tuberculous individuals  <cit> . patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis exhale no, which is associated with increased production of inos by alveolar macrophages  <cit> . moreover, histopathologic studies have shown that inos is expressed in human tuberculous granulomas  <cit> . recently, our group demonstrated the expression of inos in mØs and multinucleated langhans-type giant cells, as well as extensive mØs nitrosylation within bovine tuberculosis granulomas  <cit> . finally, some inos polymorphisms seem to be associated with an increased susceptibility to tb in humans  <cit> .

at high concentration, no kills mtb very efficiently in vitro while, at lower doses, it exhibits a bacteriostatic and hormetic effects  <cit> . the cell damage induced by no may result in dna mutations and strand breaks or nitrosylation of key proteins, including enzymes that may lose activity  <cit> . the ability of mtb to survive and replicate within the mØs, even in the presence of adverse factors such as no, seems essential for the development of the infection. the identification of mechanisms used by mycobacteria to evade nitrosative damage is an important goal since it could help to develop strategies for treating or preventing tb. for instance, there are mtb genes known to be involved in resistance to the damage induced by nitric oxide  <cit> . the results reported in this study show that the structurally related tat is to be considered a potential virulence factor of mycobacteria as well. tat is highly recognized by serum antibodies in individuals with active tuberculosis  <cit> , a fact that was once attributed to cross-reactivity of tat to anti-dat antibodies. more recently, structural studies of mtb glycolipids have evidenced the presence of tat in both clinical isolates and typical strains  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report dealing with a biological activity of tat on antimycobacterial immune response. further studies will be needed to clarify whether the fatty acyl structural differences between species may account for the effects herein described.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that dat and tat, two glycolipids located on the cell wall behave as virulence factors engaged in the downregulation of no and inos, therefore representing a potential weapon of the mycobacteria against the innate immune response.
