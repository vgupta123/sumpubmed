BACKGROUND
myotragus balearicus  <cit>  was an extremely modified caprine, endemic of the balearic islands, characterized by a series of unusual apomorphies developed throughout more than five million years of insular evolution  <cit> . myotragus disappeared from mallorca between  <dig>  and  <dig>  years bc  <cit> , probably after the arrival of the first humans to the islands. the morphological peculiarities of myotragus, including extreme size reduction, a single ever growing lower incisor, modified limb bones and frontal eyes  <cit> , makes it difficult to clarify its taxonomic position  <cit> .

in two previous studies  <cit> , we obtained bits of the mtdna cytochrome b gene from two different myotragus bone specimens from mallorca island, one found in cova estreta  and the other found in cova des gorgs . although the quick radiation of all the caprinae  <cit>  and the short cytochrome b fragment retrieved  made the previous analysis difficult, our data indicated that myotragus was genetically close to the sheep  group.

there is a general agreement that the continental ancestor of the balearic bovid possibly settled in mallorca and menorca during the messinian period. the balearic islands were last connected to the continent during the messinian regression, when the mediterranean basin was dried out, allowing faunal exchanges between the islands and the continental lands  <cit> . the opening of the strait of gibraltar  <dig>  mya definitely isolated the balearic islands and promoted the beginning of the independent evolution of myotragus  <cit> . the myotragus lineage spreads from the pliocene to the holocene, and includes in mallorca five chronospecies: m. pepgonellae, m. antiquus, m. kopperi, m. batei and m. balearicus. no absolute datings are available for the oldest species, m. pepgonellae, although a chronology of lower pliocene has been proposed; a paleomagnetic data of about  <dig>  my is available for m. antiquus remains  <cit> . apart from two shrews from the islands of crete and sicily, respectively, no other pliocene endemic mammal persists in mediterranean islands  <cit> . thus, the accurately dated vicariant event that isolated myotragus from their continental relatives constitutes a unique opportunity to use the sequences of myotragus for calibrating the dna molecular clock of caprines. previously, only dates outside caprines , or dates that are too recent for accurate estimations  could be used  <cit> . in addition, since the molecular clock is not perfect, it is necessary to use as much sequence information as possible to obtain reliable date estimates. for this purpose, we decided to retrieve the complete cytochrome b gene and some other genetic markers of myotragus; to do this, we used a newly excavated myotragus bone, obtained in  <dig> from cova des gorgs, that looked macroscopically very well preserved and therefore was suggestive of dna survival. we designed different sets of overlapping primers for retrieving the complete cytochrome b gene, as well as a  <dig> bp fragment from another mtdna gene, the 12s. in addition, we retrieved a short fragment of a nuclear gene, 28s rdna, from the same extract. the only precedent of nuclear dna retrieval from warm climates is, to our knowledge, the analysis of a ground sloth coprolite from the south of united states  <cit> .

our results confirm that ovis is the sister group of myotragus. we also show that the initial radiation of caprines occurred  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, more recent than the date obtained in other analyses that used very different calibration points  <cit> . finally, we show that the cytochrome b sequences of alpine and southern chamois, until recently considered to be subspecies, have been separated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, much longer than previously suspected.

RESULTS
ancient dna sequences
the complete  <dig>  nucleotides of the cytochrome b gene were retrieved in seven overlapping fragments , including the  <dig> base pairs section between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>   already retrieved in a previous work  <cit>  and a section of  <dig> bp replicated in oxford  . two discrepancies with the previous consensus sequences were observed, a t in position  <dig>  and a t in  <dig> . the first one was already reported as heteroplasmic in the cloned pcr product in  <cit> , where it was present in five up to ten clones sequenced. the latter was not found in our previous study; therefore, it can correspond to a silent polymorphism within the myotragus population or to a dna damage involving a rare a to t change in that particular pcr reaction. all cytochrome b fragments were routinely cloned , although very few heteroplasmies were detected in the direct sequencing, attributable to both the exceptional preservation of the sample and the short lengths of the fragments; consequently, the error rate in the clones  was very low . considering the overlapping of the primers and the fragment replicated,  <dig> bp  have been determined from more than one pcr. it cannot be discarded that dna damage could have affected some positions, although it is unlikely that this would significantly alter the phylogenetic inferences.

the putative presence of nuclear mtdna insertions is very unlikely, since we proceed designing the l primers for the next fragment in the sequence already retrieved from the previous fragment, and the h primers in a consensus caprinae sequence. the 12s gene sequence  was retrieved in three overlapping fragments . the sequences found in 12s showed several differences from those of extant caprinae, a fact that points to its authenticity.

the pcr of the 28s nuclear gene yielded a very faint band around  <dig> base pairs and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. in addition, dna from tissue samples from domestic goat , southern chamois  and domestic sheep  was extracted in a separated laboratory, and the same 28s fragment was determined. the  <dig> base pairs sequence obtained from myotragus is similar to that found in other caprinae , and clearly different to the human one and to the cow, a suggested source of contamination because of the use of bsa  in ancient dna amplifications. moreover, no other bovids, extinct or living, had been analyzed in the same laboratory when the extraction, amplification, cloning and sequencing of the myotragus genes was undertaken; therefore, the 28s sequence seems to be endogenous of myotragus. the cloning of the 28s pcr product  showed that two of the sequences  were human contaminants; this accounts for the noise observed in the direct sequencing of the pcr product. most likely, the human dna comes from handling of the myotragus bones during its excavation and posterior morphological study. nevertheless, the error rate in the clones is relatively low , a figure within the range found in some modern specimens and well preserved ancient remains, like the moas  <cit> .

variation in length is characteristic of 28s gene; size variations are due to expansions or contractions of variable segments in 10– <dig> positions within the gene, where variation does not interfere with ribosomal function  <cit> . the sequences were aligned by eye; due to the high interspecific variation in 28s, no definite alignment is possible and therefore, the phylogenetic information obtained from this gene is limited. however, the retrieval of a nuclear gene indicates the quality of the dna of the sample used. furthermore, it opens new possibilities of research for assessing the phylogenetic relationships of myotragus and for retrieving nuclear genes with phenotypic implications.

phylogeny of the caprinae subfamily and the position of myotragus in the tree
we included pantholops hodgsoni in the phylogenetic analysis since previous analysis as well as ours indicate that this species is clearly associated to other members of the subfamily caprinae. as an outgroup, we used  <dig> members of the tribes alcephalini and hippotragini  previously detected as the closest members within the bovidae  <cit> . the cytochrome b and cytochrome b + 12s bayesian and maximum-likelihood trees  showed a topology roughly similar to that found in previous studies on caprinae phylogeny . recently, it has been reported that the budorcas cytochrome b sequence available at genbank was in fact a chimaera that included a fragment of ovis sequence, and a new sequence for this species was provided  <cit> . crucially, in previous works myotragus formed a quite stable clade with budorcas and ovis that is not maintained anymore, with budorcas now clustering in a different position.

examination of the cytochrome b trees  shows that some of the clades previously found are present in these trees, specially myotragus+ovis , capricornis+ovibos+naemorhedus  and hemitragus+pseudois+capra . the position of hemitragus, that precludes the monophyly of the genus capra, is problematic, as some authors have already noticed  <cit> . some species show unstable positions in the trees, particularly the genera budorcas, ammotragus, pantholops, rupicapra and oreamnos. the problematic position of these taxa has been already reported on extant species studies . however, our tree, although still with low bootstrap values, has been able to better resolve the phylogenetic position of myotragus, which is basal to the ovis clade; the support value for the myotragus+ovis grouping is now  <dig>  in the bayesian tree and the bootstrap value  <dig> % in the maximum-likelihood tree, respectively  <cit> .

the trees with the cytochrome b + 12s fragment  did not significantly improve the phylogeny ; the capricornis+ovibos and hemitragus+pseudois+capra clades are well supported by bootstrap analysis, while the support of the cluster of myotragus+ovis is reduced with respect to the cytochrome b sequence alone. this discrepancy can be attributed to the small number of informative positions added by the 12s fragment together with the reduced number of species that could be used due to the unavailability of the 12s sequence in many species.

evolutionary rates and diversification of caprinae
the complete resolution of the caprinae phylogeny cannot be achieved with the cytochrome b gene alone, as some species of the subfamily  still have an unstable position. it is likely that the lack of resolution in the basal branches is due to the existence of a very quick initial radiation in the caprinae subfamily. to test this, we performed a likelihood ratio test for zero branch-length of all branches of the tree, that showed that there are nine branches with p >  <dig>  . five of them belong to the basal branches of the caprinae tree, thus supporting the hypothesis of a very fast initial radiation of this group. additionally, the plot of grow of lineages of an ultrametric tree  also supports this fast initial radiation.

being myotragus a small caprine, its long branch in the maximum-likelihood tree previously detected with a cytochrome b fragment  <cit>  was attributed to an earlier age of first reproduction and a shorter generation time in myotragus than in other wild caprines  <cit> . this long branch is also present in the trees of the complete cytochrome b . however, recent estimates indicate that myotragus was actually bigger than previously believed, with a weight ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> kg for the smallest adult specimens and between  <dig> and  <dig> kg for the larger specimens  <cit> . therefore the reason for this long branch cannot be due to its presumed extreme reduced size . on the other hand, the hypothesis that tries to explain differences in evolutionary rates as due to differences in metabolic rate or generation time  was not supported in the analysis of cytochrome b evolutionary rates of a wide set of mammalian species  <cit> . it is thus more likely that this relatively long branch of myotragus in the caprinae tree is mainly a stochastic phenomenon.

dating of the caprinae phylogeny
due to the endemicity of myotragus  <cit> , it can be hypothesized that this lineage diverged from the continental species  <dig>  million years ago , when the desiccation of the mediterranean ended  <cit>  and the myotragus ancestors became isolated in the balearic islands. in principle, this would be a minimum age for the node in the tree, but we consider likely that the isolation of the balearic islands was a vicariant event responsible for the split of the myotragus and continental lineages, so that we can use this date as a fixed age in the caprinae cytochrome b tree . the dating results for the maximum-likelihood and bayesian trees are very similar and only the former are shown. we have calculated ultrametric trees using the langley-fitch method  <cit>  as well as the penalyzed likelihood method with several smoothing factors  <cit>  implemented in the r8s program. the cross-validation procedure to explore the fidelity with which these different methods explain the branch length variation in the tree indicates that the langley-fitch method is slightly better for our data set and therefore we used this method in the calculations described next . in addition, we have performed a parametric bootstrap procedure, in which we simulated alignments from the maximum-likelihood tree and re-calculated dates from the same maximum-likelihood topology with branch lengths optimized for each simulated alignment. this allowed us to evaluate the stochastic errors of date estimates associated to sampling a finite number of alignment positions  <cit> . in a different parametric bootstrap procedure, we reconstructed new trees from each simulated alignment and used them for time estimation  and therefore errors associated with finite number of positions as well as with tree reconstruction imperfections are estimated  <cit> . the standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals for most date estimates were very similar for both parametric bootstrap procedures , indicating that most of the errors in the present data set are associated to the finite sample sequence rather than to tree errors. in the following, standard deviations given refer to the parametric bootstrap using only the original topology for calculating dates.

the ultrametric trees calculated by the langley-fitch method applied to the cytochrome b maximum-likelihood tree showed that the separation of the most divergent lineages within caprinae  occurred  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya. these dates are more recent than a proposed caprinae radiation  <dig> mya based on different molecular calibrations   <cit> . there is no general consensus from fossil data on the date of the start of the caprinae radiation, that ranges from around  <dig> mya  <cit>  to a more recent late miocene origin  <cit> , which would be more consistent with our results.

after the first split, the separation of the most basal lineages took place around or before  <dig>  mya , and therefore we can estimate that the main radiation of caprines occurred in less than one million years of evolution. a lineages through time plot, that reflects the number of lineages in each split point of the tree , indicates a fast growing of lineages during the first million years of evolution in comparison with the flatter slope in the rest of the tree. although a few species are missing in this tree, all genera are covered and it is likely that the tree with all species will reveal the same clear steep slope at its base. this truly supports the existence of a quite fast initial radiation that led to the differentiation of nine clades  that are at the base of all extant genera. in addition, this explains the difficulties we face in reconstructing the phylogenetic tree of this group.

interestingly, the separation of the two chamois species  and the beginning of the radiation of the main clade of goats  occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, according to the calibrated cytochrome b tree. this would imply that the beginning of the pleistocene glaciations promoted the diversification of the main lineages of caprinae species living in the alps and other eurasian mountainous regions. the deep split observed between the alpine and southern chamois, at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya, is quite remarkable, since these two species have been considered subspecies until recently  <cit> , and other molecular studies have given much more recent dates for the separation of these two species using restriction fragment length polymorphism of mitochondrial dna  <cit>  or microsatellites  <cit> . their split is even older than that between capra pyrenaica and capra ibex, a pair of species with a similar geographic disjunction than the two chamois and traditionally recognized as different species, that separated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya according to our data. to test whether the deep split observed between the two chamois was caused by particularly divergent cytochrome b haplotypes of chamois used in this study, we performed the calibrations with all sequences of chamois in databases, including shorter ones , obtaining very similar dates . to analyze if the date of this split depended on the particularly long branch of myotragus, we manually reduced this branch to the half, but we obtained again similar dates for all splits in the trees . this is due to the smoothing of rates performed by the calibration methods used, that correct for the higher evolutionary rate of the myotragus lineage. to account for the possibility that myotragus could be more basal in the tree, we manually positioned myotragus just after the separation of pantholops. then the split date of the two chamois was reduced, but only up to  <dig>  mya. this is in agreement with the parametric bootstrap analyses , that indicate that the tree topology is not crucial in this calculation. this is surely due to the small internal branches involved in all different topologies arranging the basal species of the tree. other works where several topologies were used for calculating dates have also shown that age estimates were largely insensitive to different phylogenies  <cit> .

finally, if myotragus and ovis had diverged in fact more recently and the ancestors of myotragus had reached the balearic islands via a transmarine colonization after these islands became disconnected from the continent, as proposed for other vertebrates  <cit> , all the dates in the tree could be more recent; however, this hypothesis is extremely unlikely in myotragus from the paleontological evidence  <cit> . on the other hand, the use of evolutionary rates calculated from other sources, for example, the separation of humans and chimpanzees  <dig> –  <dig> mya  <cit>  combined with the genetic distance between their cytochrome b sequence, would lead to a separation of myotragus and ovis clades at  <dig>  mya. although the use of an external calibration could be problematic, this reference would not support a transmarine colonization of myotragus ancestors. thus, the calibrated cytochrome b trees indicate that alpine and southern chamois have been separated much longer than previously thought, which would help explain the anti-hybridization mechanisms currently operating  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study is among the first ones in which mitochondrial as well as nuclear dna has been retrieved from an extinct species from a warm location, in this case the mediterranean area. also, our research demonstrates the importance of ancient dna in phylogenetics, since we have been able to use the isolation of myotragus in the baleric islands as a vicariant event for dating the caprinae phylogenetic tree. this is quite a unique opportunity for mammals because, contrary to other zoological groups such as insects, reptiles or amphibians, almost no extant endemic mammal remains in these islands.
