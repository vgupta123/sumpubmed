BACKGROUND
rnai is a sequence-specific gene silencing mechanism  <cit>  initiated by 19– <dig> nucleotide  duplexes known as small-interfering rnas   <cit> . sirnas are processed from long double-stranded rna  molecules by the ribonuclease iii enzyme dicer  <cit>  and are unwound and loaded as single-stranded rnas into the rna induced silencing complex   <cit> . risc can then silence gene expression via cleavage of messenger rna  transcripts that are complementary to the incorporated sirna sequence  <cit> . rnai-mediated silencing can be adapted for specific gene targets in vertebrates via transfection of sirna duplexes  <cit>  or dna vectors which express sirnas as short-hairpin rnas   <cit> . shrnas are transcribed from these vectors as 19– <dig> nt inverted repeat sequences, separated by a 4– <dig> nt loop sequence and fold spontaneously to form hairpin structures, which are cleaved by dicer into active sirnas  <cit> .

pol iii type  <dig> promoters are most commonly used to express shrnas  <cit> , as these promoters normally transcribe endogenous small-nuclear rnas  such as u <dig> and 7sk. termination of transcription by pol iii also occurs at defined tracts of 4– <dig> thymidines   <cit> , which can be inserted downstream of shrna coding sequences to ensure direct termination. unlike type  <dig> and  <dig> promoters, pol iii type  <dig> promoters are located entirely upstream of transcription start sites  and feature characteristic promoter elements including; a tata box beginning at around bp - <dig> , a proximal sequence element  centred around bp - <dig> and a distal sequence element  beginning around bp - <dig>  <cit> . in the human u <dig> and 7sk  promoters, the dse is comprised of at least one octamer  motif  <cit>  and an sphi post-octamer homology  domain  <cit> . the dse of the human 7sk  also, contains an additional caccc box enhancer located between the oct and sph elements  <cit> . u <dig> promoters are the most common type of promoter used for in vector-based shrna expression systems, however, more recent approaches have preferred the use of 7sk promoters  <cit> .

given the recent completion of the chicken genome project  <cit> , the adaptation and use of shrna expression systems for rnai in the chicken will be important for ensuing functional genomics studies. however, to date, most shrna expression systems used in chickens feature mammalian pol iii promoters. although several chicken u <dig>  promoters have now been characterised and shown to drive efficient shrna-mediated rnai activity in chickens  <cit> , recent work has highlighted that 7sk promoters in human  and bovine  can stimulate more efficient shrna expression and rnai activity than corresponding u <dig> promoters  <cit> . given that expression of the 7sk snrna appears to be conserved across non-mammalian and mammalian vertebrates  <cit>  we sought to investigate whether a chicken 7sk promoter  would also confer greater levels of shrna-mediated rnai activity than the recently-characterised cu <dig> promoters.

RESULTS
identifying the chicken 7sk promoter
pol iii type  <dig> promoters are characterised by the presence of gene-external promoter elements 5' of the transcription start site  <cit> . to identify the ch7sk promoter we used a bioinformatics approach and scanned the chicken genome for sequences with significant  homology to the chicken 7sk snrna gene sequence . we then analysed the 5' flanking regions of these sequences for the presence of pol iii promoter elements. the absence of sequences resembling a tata box within the 5' flanking regions of 7sk snrna blast hits on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , indicated that these 5' flanking regions probably did not encode functional 7sk pol iii promoters. however, putative pol iii promoter elements including a tata box with homology to that of both the h7sk and b7sk promoters , were present within the 5' flanking region of the full-length, ch7sk snrna sequence, located on chicken chromosome  <dig> . this analysis indicated that the chicken genome contained only a single putative ch7sk promoter.

using pcr we amplified a  <dig> bp region containing the putative ch7sk promoter sequence, which was cloned into pgem®-t easy. sequencing of the cloned insert identified three clones; pch7sk- <dig> , pch7sk- <dig>  and pch7sk- <dig> . each of these clones showed 99% homology to the sequence immediately upstream of the ch7sk snrna transcription start site on chromosome  <dig> of the chicken genome. alignment of the last  <dig> bp  of each of these clone sequences against the h7sk  <cit>  and b7sk  <cit>  promoter sequences, identified typical pol iii promoter elements including; a tata box at bp - <dig> to - <dig>  pse at bp - <dig> to - <dig>  and octmotifs at bp - <dig> to - <dig> , bp - <dig> to - <dig>  and bp - <dig> to - <dig>  and an sph domain at bp - <dig> to - <dig> . the pse, oct- <dig> and sph elements also displayed considerable homology to published consensus sequences   <cit> . the presence of these elements within the cloned 5' flanking region of the ch7sk snrna gene sequence, suggested that this region probably encoded a functional ch7sk promoter.

the ch7sk promoter expresses shrnas
in order to validate its function, the putative ch7sk promoter sequence was used to construct the shrna expression vectors, pch7sk-shegfp and pch7sk-mcs-shegfp, designed to transcribe shrnas targeting egfp  . a third vector, pch7sk-shirr, designed to transcribe an irrelevant shrna  targeting an influenza virus nucleocapsid protein   <cit>  from the ch7sk promoter, was also constructed as a negative control . the function of the isolated ch7sk promoter sequence was verified by detection of shegfp expression in chicken embryo fibroblast  cells transfected with the pch7sk-shegfp or pch7sk-mcs-shegfp constructs. rna was extracted at  <dig> hours post-transfection and shegfp expression was detected using an rnase protection assay  . as a positive control for shegfp detection, df- <dig> cells were also transfected with vectors expressing identical shegfp sequences from pre-validated mouse u <dig>   <cit> , chicken u6- <dig> , chicken u6- <dig>  or chicken u6- <dig>  pol iii promoters  <cit> .

a  <dig> nt band was detected in rna samples from cells transfected with both the pch7sk-shegfp and pch7sk-mcs-shegfp constructs . this band corresponded with the expected size of protected shegfp sequence as well as specific bands detected in the positive control mouse u <dig>  and cu6-shegfp-transfected positive control cells . no shegfp expression was detected in rna samples from the pch7sk-shirr negative control, or non-transfected cells  . detection of mir- <dig> as a loading control in all transfected and control rna samples, confirmed the presence of total small rnas . these results verified the predicted promoter activity of the cloned ch7sk sequence and demonstrated that the ch7sk promoter could express shegfp molecules.

the ch7sk promoter directs shrna-mediated rnai knockdown
to verify that the shegfp expressed by the ch7sk promoter could direct rnai-mediated knockdown of an egfp reporter gene, we conducted egfp knockdown assays by co-transfecting chicken df- <dig> cells with the pch7sk-shegfp, pch7sk-mcs-shegfp or positive control, pmu6-shegfp and pez-b7sk-shegfp  <cit>  constructs, with an egfp expression vector  . given that co-transfection of reporter and shrna expression plasmids is considered to be 100% efficient for validation of specific rnai activity  <cit> , we considered any reduction in egfp fluorescence intensity to reflect rnai-mediated egfp knockdown. egfp knockdown was assessed for each co-transfection condition in duplicate using fluorescence microscopy  and quantified using flow cytometry by sampling the mean fluorescence intensity  from triplicate co-transfections for each condition  .

in df- <dig> cells co-transfected with pegfp-n <dig> and either the pch7sk-shegfp or pch7sk-mcs-shegfp constructs, the egfp mfi was significantly reduced to  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  respectively  . these reductions were not found to differ significantly from the egfp mfi measured in the positive control pmu6-shegfp  and pez-b7sk-shegfp  co-transfected cells  . given both the mu <dig> and b7sk promoters are known to express functional shegfp molecules that direct specific egfp knockdown in df- <dig> cells  <cit> , this result indicated that the shegfp molecules expressed by the ch7sk promoter could direct efficient knockdown  of egfp in df- <dig> cells.

comparison of ch7sk and cu <dig> promoter induced egfp knockdown
we further compared the efficiency of rnai knockdown mediated by the ch7sk promoter, to cu <dig> promoters; cu6- <dig>  cu6- <dig> and cu6- <dig>   <cit>  by comparing the reduction in egfp mfi induced between the pcu6-1-shegfp, pcu6-3-shegfp and pcu6-4-shegfp vectors and the two ch7sk-shegfp constructs; pch7sk-shegfp and pch7sk-mcs-shegfp .

fluorescence microscopy results indicated that the egfp knockdown induced by both of the ch7sk-shegfp constructs was comparable to that induced by pcu6-4-shegfp and pcu6-3-shegfp, but greater than that conferred by pcu6-1-shegfp . however, statistical analyses of mfi data  indicated no significant difference in the reduction of egfp mfi between the pcu6-1-shegfp , pch7sk-shegfp , pch7sk-mcs-shegfp  or pcu6-3-shegfp  transfection conditions  . the pcu6-4-shegfp co-transfected cells showed the greatest reduction in egfp mfi to  <dig> % , which was significantly lower than for the pch7sk-mcs-shegfp and pcu6-1-shegfp co-transfected cells , but not significantly different to the mfi of either the pch7sk-shegfp or pcu6-3-shegfp-co-transfected cells  . taken together, these results indicated that neither of the ch7sk-shegfp constructs induced more efficient rnai-knockdown of egfp than existing cu6-shegfp constructs in df- <dig> cells.

discussion
the chicken is an important livestock animal and a key model for studies of vertebrate development and gene function  <cit> . thus the development of rnai technologies adapted for use in chicken systems will be important for further annotation of the chicken genome. although several recently characterised chicken u <dig>  promoters have been used to develop effective chicken-specific shrna expression systems  <cit> , 7sk promoters have been shown to direct more efficient rnai activity than u <dig> promoters in mammals  <cit> . to investigate whether this promoter relationship also exists in chickens we have characterised the ch7sk promoter and compared its ability to confer rnai activity to that of existing cu <dig> promoters.

although several 7sk pseudogenes exist in the chicken genome  <cit>  we characterised the ch7sk promoter sequence upstream of the full-length chicken 7sk snrna sequence on chromosome  <dig>  in the human, bovine and mouse genomes only single functional 7sk promoters have been identified upstream of 7sk snrna coding sequences  <cit> . our finding that only the full-length ch7sk snrna sequence features an active upstream promoter region is therefore consistent with the notion that only a single functional 7sk promoter is present in the chicken genome. the ch7sk promoter was also found to contain typical pol iii promoter elements; tata, pse, oct and sph  which show positional and sequence similarities to those of the h7sk and b7sk promoters   <cit> . further, we noted that the ch7sk locus was flanked by homologues of the glutathione s transferase-a <dig> and intestinal cell kinase  genes which are also located 5' and 3' respectively of the identified mammalian 7sk loci. this level of synteny in the arrangement of the 7sk loci between chicken and other mammalian species is also reflected in recent comparative analyses of chromosome synteny blocks conserved between chicken and mammalian genomes  <cit> . this apparent conservation in the arrangement of the ch7sk locus with respect to surrounding genes indicates that the ch7sk promoter characterised in the present study may be the only functional 7sk promoter in the chicken genome.

our results clearly demonstrated that the ch7sk promoter was able to express functional shrna molecules capable of mediating greater than 50% rnai-knockdown of the target egfp reporter gene. however, we found no evidence that the ch7sk promoter could direct more efficient shrna-mediated rnai knockdown compared to the cu6- <dig>  cu6- <dig> and cu6- <dig> promoters. this interpretation was based on a lack of significant difference in the level of egfp mfi between cells co-transfected with pch7sk-shegfp and any of the cu6-shegfp constructs, or between cells co-transfected with pch7sk-mcs-shegfp and pcu6-1-shegfp and pcu6-3-shegfp. we cannot rule out however, that the ch7sk promoter may actually be less efficient than the cu6- <dig> promoter, given that our mfi data indicated the pcu6-4-shegfp construct could direct a more significant reduction in egfp mfi than the pch7sk-mcs-shegfp construct . our results also reflect those of a recent study by das et.al.  <cit> , which compared the efficiency of cu <dig> and mu <dig> promoters for expression of a mirna operon in df- <dig> cells. the levels of luciferase knockdown induced by the cu <dig> promoters of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  are similar to those we have measured for these promoters against egfp . kudo and sutou   <cit>  and wise et.al.,   <cit>  also report that the cu6- <dig> promoter shows the highest efficiency of the five cu <dig> promoters characterised so far; cu6- <dig>  cu6- <dig>  cu6- <dig>  cu6- <dig>  <cit>  and cu6-1variant  <cit> . consideration of our results against these findings suggests therefore, that the ch7sk promoter may indeed be less efficient than the cu6- <dig> promoter. given, however, that we could find no significant difference in the level of egfp knockdown induced by shegfp expressed from the ch7sk, cu6- <dig> and cu6- <dig> promoters, indicates that in general, the efficiency of the ch7sk promoter is comparable to that of these other cu <dig> promoters.

interestingly, our results contrast findings published by lambeth et.al.,   <cit>  and koper-emde et. al.,   <cit> , who independently demonstrated that the b7sk and h7sk promoters confer more efficient shrna expression and rnai activity than bovine and human u <dig> promoters, respectively. despite close alignment of the ch7sk, h7sk and b7sk promoter elements, we noted some distinct differences within the dse or enhancer region of the ch7sk promoter, which affect the structural organisation of the ch7sk promoter in relation to its mammalian homologues . given the structure and sequence of promoter elements within the dse can influence maximal transcription efficiency in u <dig> and 7sk promoters  <cit> , the variable structure of the ch7sk dse may have an inherent impact upon its efficiency relative to u <dig> promoters.

unlike the b7sk and h7sk promoters, the dse of the ch7sk promoter does not contain a caccc box , which appears to be a distinct feature of 7sk promoters and is reported to serve an important role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of the h7sk promoter  <cit> . it is possible that the absence of a caccc box in the ch7sk promoter may affect its overall efficiency by reducing enhancer activity in the ch7sk dse to a level more similar to that seen in u <dig> promoters. this could explain why we observed comparable levels of egfp knockdown induced between the ch7sk and cu <dig> promoters. moreover, the absence of the caccc box from the enhancer may further indicate that the enhancer mechanism in the ch7sk promoter may be more similar to that of u <dig> promoters than other mammalian 7sk promoters.

a second feature of the ch7sk enhancer, distinct from mammalian 7sk promoters is the presence of a c/a substitution at position  <dig>  of the ch7sk oct- <dig> motif . previous work has shown that mutation of the oct- <dig> motif in the h7sk promoter has the strongest impact on transcriptional efficiency  <cit> , so it is possible that this substitution may affect the activity of the ch7sk enhancer. however, an oct- <dig> sequence identical to that of the ch7sk promoter is present in the enhancer of the rna polymerase ii  promoter of the chicken u4b  snrna  <cit>  , which shows full affinity for the octamer transcription factor   <cit> . therefore, it is unlikely that the ch7sk oct- <dig> motif would affect promoter efficiency through a reduced ability to bind oct- <dig>  optimal enhancer activity in the cu4b promoter however, is also dependent upon the presence of a downstream sph domain adjacent to oct- <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the position of the ch7sk sph domain  <dig> bp downstream of oct- <dig> corresponds closely to that of the cu4b promoter and shows striking homology  to the cu4b sph sequence   <cit> . given this level of structural identity, it is pertinent to suggest that the enhancer mechanism operating in the ch7sk promoter may be analogous to that of the cu4b promoter and require adjacent oct- <dig> and sph domains.

co-dependence of oct and sph motifs in pol iii enhancer mechanisms is common to other non-mammalian vertebrate pol iii promoters including the xenopus laevis trnasec promoter  <cit> . similarly, human u <dig> promoters also appear to rely upon the presence of both oct and sph elements for efficient enhancer activity  <cit> . this type of enhancer mechanism contrasts what is known about the function of the h7sk enhancer, where optimal transcription efficiency is not dependent upon the presence of an sph domain  <cit> . therefore, based on the structural features of the ch7sk enhancer, we propose that ch7sk enhancer mechanism may be less divergent from pol ii and pol iii promoters such as u4b and u <dig>  than from other mammalian 7sk promoters.

since ours is the first study to characterise the a non-mammalian vertebrate 7sk promoter, further characterisation and cross-species analysis of other vertebrate 7sk promoters would be necessary to evaluate this notion of divergent 7sk enhancer mechanisms. whilst this type of investigation was beyond the scope of our study, it would go further to more strongly define promoter characteristics which govern the efficiency of 7sk promoters. this knowledge would be of substantial benefit to the development of more efficient shrna expression systems for cross-species rnai applications.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have identified and isolated a functional chicken homologue of the 7sk snrna promoter and demonstrated its ability to confer efficient shrna expression and rnai-knockdown of a reporter gene in a chicken cell line. we further found that the efficiency of the ch7sk promoter was similar to that of existing cu <dig> promoters, which contrasts previous comparisons of mammalian u <dig> and 7sk promoters. the ch7sk promoter is the first non-mammalian vertebrate 7sk promoter to be characterised, so this finding may reflect inherent differences in the divergence of pol iii promoter activities between mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates. this aside, our results clearly indicate that the ch7sk promoter is an efficient alternative to u6-based shrna expression systems for inducing efficient rnai activity in chicken cells. this and the characterisation of other chicken-specific promoters for rnai applications will be of particular benefit to furthering functional genomic analysis of the chicken genome and in developmental studies which utilise the chicken as a model system.
