BACKGROUND
rapid advances in epigenetics have led to the discovery of complex mechanisms of gene regulation involving phenomena such as dna methylation and chromatin modifications. methylation of particular histone residues has been found to correlate with specific and often opposing cellular functions, e.g. trimethylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  is associated with transcriptional start sites  of active genes while trimethylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  is found to mark broad genomic regions for repression. recent studies have also suggested that characteristic combinations of histone modifications or ‘chromatin states’ define functional elements of the genome and determine their contribution to transcriptional regulation
 <cit> . moreover, the epigenetic state of host genes have been observed to be affected by viral infection leading to tumors in humans
 <cit> . thus, epigenetics constitute a dynamic regulatory framework linking genotypes with environmental factors that could play a major role in differential disease responses among individuals having high genetic similarity.

marek’s disease  is a highly contagious disease caused by an oncogenic α-herpesvirus md virus  and characterized by t-cell lymphomas in chickens
 <cit> . major losses to the poultry industry as a result of md have largely been averted due to the success of various vaccination strategies which, remarkably, is also the first instance of the successful control of a natural cancer-causing agent using vaccines
 <cit> . however, the virulence of the virus may have progressively increased as a consequence of vaccine development
 <cit> . several reported instances of vaccine breaks or reduced efficacy of vaccination, therefore, underlines the importance of investigating resistance to the disease as a long-term strategy to control mdv.

natural resistance to mdv can be divided into two categories: major histocompatibility complex -associated resistance, wherein different mhc haplotypes at the b blood group locus confer varying levels of resistance and non-mhc associated resistance in which birds having the same mhc haplotype exhibit vastly different responses to mdv infection. inbred lines  <dig> and  <dig> developed at the avian disease and oncology laboratory  that we used in this study, fall into the latter category. these lines share a high degree of genetic similarity but have divergent responses to mdv infection completely independent of the mhc. several studies have attempted to pinpoint factors responsible for conferring resistance
 <cit> , but confounding factors, such as, tissue types, virus strains and ages of birds have made it difficult to find a consensus. multiple risk elements are possibly at play in this complex disease, and increased resistance or susceptibility is likely to be produced by a combination of such factors. in this study, we take a closer look at epigenetic factors behind different responses to md with a view to a deeper understanding of the broader genomic impact of mdv infection.

we utilized the above population of inbred chickens – line  <dig> is highly resistant to md, while line  <dig> is highly susceptible – and compared the epigenetic effects of md. genome-wide maps of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> in thymus tissues of birds from these chicken lines at the latent stage of mdv infection were generated. we carried out systematic analyses to find differential chromatin marks induced by mdv infection. we also investigated co-localization patterns of the two chromatin modifications to detect putative bivalent domains and the effect of mdv on such domains. the results of our study confirm that marek’s disease has far-reaching effects on the epigenetic landscape of chicken lines with diverse responses to the virus and, thus, furthers our understanding of this complex disease.

RESULTS
genome-wide distribution of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me3
we performed chip-seq experiments on infected and uninfected birds from lines  <dig> and  <dig> to investigate the epigenetic effects of mdv infection. more than  <dig> million reads from eight samples were mapped to the chicken genome yielding  <dig> and  <dig> significantly enriched regions  for h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  respectively . we further classified these regions as follows: ubiquitous sers were found in all samples and were likely due to similarities in the genetic background of the chickens. line-specific sers were present in only one line either before or after mdv infection, while condition-specific sers appeared in both lines but only in individuals with the same infection status.

63i: line  <dig> infected, 63n: line  <dig> control, 72i: line  <dig> infected, 72n: line  <dig> control.

ubiquitous sers formed the largest percentage of all enriched regions, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % in h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> samples, respectively. in the case of h3k4me <dig>  there were large differences in the number of specific sers - more than  <dig> line-specific sers were found in line  <dig>  compared to about  <dig> in line  <dig>  similarly, we found 50% more line-specific sers of h3k27me <dig> in line  <dig>  compared to line  <dig> . however, upon closer examination, most of the line-specific and condition-specific sers were revealed to have low read counts  corresponding to regions of low enrichment.

genes were divided into five regions – promoter, 5’ untranslated region , exons, introns and 3’ utr – and the distribution of sers across these elements was probed . we found a large number of intergenic regions marked by h3k27me <dig>  consistent with high levels of this mark associated with areas of silent heterochromatin. in the case of h3k4me <dig>  a larger proportion of sers were found around the promoter, exons and the 5’ utr while similar proportions of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> sers were present in introns and 3’ utrs. a comparison of the genomic distributions of sers in the different samples  showed a similar number of h3k4me <dig> sers across the promoter, exons and the 5’ and 3’ utrs of genes. line  <dig> contained a higher number of intronic and intergenic sers as compared to line  <dig> although this did not appear to change as a result of mdv infection. on the other hand, a greater number of h3k27me <dig> sers were found in the infected samples although these levels were similar in the two different lines.

to analyze the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression, histone modification profiles surrounding the tss and gene body were plotted for genes ranked by their expression level . as expected, a strong positive correlation was observed between gene expression and h3k4me <dig> marks with a distinct peak around the tss and little to no enrichment within the gene body. on the other hand, h3k27me <dig> showed negative correlation with gene expression with a peak near the tss followed by a broad plateau across the gene body. however, the latter relationship was non-linear – genes with lower expression had similar levels of h3k27me <dig> marks and levels were markedly distinct only at higher expression levels .

differential h3k4me <dig> marks on genes related to md
we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide chromatin marks to find significant differences in mdv-induced responses in line  <dig> and  <dig>  we used two sets of comparisons: first, to assess the influence of mdv infection within each line, we compared the infected and the non-infected samples from the same line. secondly, the non-infected samples from the two lines were compared to detect line-specific effects. as a result of this analysis we found  <dig> differential h3k4me <dig> sers and  <dig> differential h3k27me <dig> sers that mapped to  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . a majority of differential sers were found in the comparison between non-infected samples of the two lines  with several observed on genes that have been associated with mdv infection.

*fdr <  <dig> . † some genes are shared between different comparisons. 63i: line  <dig> infected, 63n: line  <dig> control, 72i: line  <dig> infected, 72n: line  <dig> control.

mx <dig> is a zinc-finger transcription factor that has antiviral properties against a large number of viruses. mx <dig> was upregulated after mdv infection
 <cit>  although its contribution to md progression is unknown. mdv infection induced a highly significant increase in h3k4me <dig> enrichment in the promoter region of mx <dig> in both lines . we observed a concurrent increase in transcript levels after mdv infection in line  <dig> ; mx <dig> expression in line  <dig> showed a similar trend  although mrna levels were much lower.

ctla- <dig> is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes that is a powerful negative regulator of t-cell activation
 <cit> . the ctla <dig> protein is expressed on t lymphocytes soon after activation and regulates t-cell proliferation, production of il- <dig> and also supports the function of treg cells that suppress immune response
 <cit> . previous studies have reported an increase in ctla- <dig> expression after mdv infection
 <cit> . we found an increase in h3k4me <dig> enrichment in line  <dig> as a result of mdv infection  and there was a similar trend in line  <dig> . consistent with the above, there was a significant increase in transcript levels after mdv infection in line  <dig>  and a small increase in line  <dig> .

mmp <dig> plays a key role in the degradation of the extra-cellular matrix, and an increase in expression has been associated with increasing tumor cell migration and tumor angiogenesis
 <cit> . mmp <dig> was upregulated during the neoplastic stage of md infection in susceptible birds
 <cit>  but downregulated in response to mdv infection during early lytic infection in susceptible and resistant chickens
 <cit> . we observed a slight increase in h3k4me <dig> enrichment after mdv infection in both lines, while line  <dig> exhibited significantly lower levels than line  <dig> . this was coupled with increased mmp <dig> expression in line  <dig> after infection  while there was no such change in line  <dig> .

genes related to cancers show epigenetic changes in response to md
we observed differential histone marks on several genes that have been associated with other cancers but not in the context of mdv infection. insulin-like growth factor  <dig> binding protein  <dig>  is an rna-binding factor that regulates the translation of mrnas produced by certain genes like igf <dig> and actb. increased expression of igf2bp <dig> has been implicated in the development and progression of cancers of various organs, e.g. lung, brain, breast and colon
 <cit> . there was no change in the h3k4me <dig> enrichment levels induced by mdv infection although a significantly higher level of enrichment was present in line  <dig> . transcript levels in line  <dig> were much higher than in line  <dig>  but reduced in response to mdv infection  .

ell associated factor  <dig>  is a testosterone regulated apoptosis inducer and tumor suppressor. inactivation of eaf <dig> has been shown to lead to tumors in multiple organs
 <cit> . there was a significant increase in h3k27me <dig> levels after mdv infection in line  <dig>  while among uninfected chickens these levels were markedly higher in line  <dig> . however, eaf <dig> expression was drastically reduced after mdv infection in line  <dig>  but showed only a small decrease in line  <dig> .

galanin  is a neuropeptide that modulates various physiological functions, such as, inhibition of insulin secretion and stimulation of growth hormone secretion. three galanin receptors are known : the expression of galr <dig> has anti-proliferative effects while galr <dig> can be both anti- or pro-proliferative in function. therefore, the gal system is considered to be a promising candidate for detection and treatment of various cancers
 <cit> . we observed an increase in h3k27me <dig> levels on gal after infection in both lines . also, expression levels were significantly lowered after mdv infection in line  <dig>  while there was a similar trend in line  <dig> . interestingly, galr <dig> had both h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> enrichments  although galr <dig> showed no significant histone marks .

chromatin co-localization patterns reveal putative bivalent genes
regions of chromatin having both active and repressive marks are said to be bivalent and have been shown to play important roles in development and genetic imprinting
 <cit> . for example, bivalent domains have been shown to mark promoters of genes that are subsequently silenced in tumors by dna hypermethylation indicating their importance in cancer
 <cit> . a mono-allelic bivalent chromatin domain that controls tissue-specific genomic imprinting at a specific locus was recently found in mice
 <cit> . to investigate the presence of such bivalent chromatin states and the possible effect of mdv infection, we defined bivalent genes as those having h3k4me <dig> reads  greater than  <dig> reads per million mapped reads  and h3k27me <dig> reads  greater than  <dig> rpm, respectively . this filtering process yielded a list of  <dig> putative bivalent genes .

functional annotation clustering of the above genes using david
 <cit>  revealed significant enrichment of several immune-related functions. these included transcription factor egr <dig> which is reported to have tumor suppressor properties, genes involved in lymphocyte activation and differentiation such as bcl <dig>  cd <dig> and smad <dig> and genes tlr <dig> and tirap that are part of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway. bivalent domains were also present on a variety of transcription factors with immune-related functions such as cited <dig>  a transactivator that regulates nf-κb, myc a transcription factor associated with hematopoetic tumors and rhob a ras family homolog that mediates apoptosis in tumor cells after dna damage. moreover, all genes involved in the top five functional annotation clusters showed higher chromatin levels in line  <dig> primarily after mdv infection .

bivalent domains are altered in response to md
we further investigated the effect of md on bivalent chromatin domains observed on bcl <dig>  cited <dig>  egr <dig>  cd <dig> and tlr <dig> . interestingly, three of these genes, cited <dig>  bcl <dig> and egr <dig>  showed identical epigenetic and transcriptional signatures.

cited <dig> is a member of the p300/cbp co-activator family that has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and plays a major role in regulating and coordinating multiple complex cellular signals to determine the expression level of a gene
 <cit> . b-cell cll/lymphoma  <dig>  is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor which was downregulated at  <dig> dpi in spleen tissues from f <dig> progeny  of md-susceptible chickens
 <cit> . egr <dig> belongs to a group of early response genes induced by a variety of signaling molecules such as growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters that is believed to play a major role in cell proliferation and apoptosis
 <cit> . overexpression of egr <dig> promotes tumor growth in kidney cells
 <cit>  but suppresses growth and transformation in other cell types, e.g. fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells
 <cit> .

in each of the above genes, both active and repressive chromatin marks were increased in response to infection in line  <dig> chickens. however, in line  <dig>  there was a definite increase in h3k27me <dig> marks but no change in h3k4me <dig> . transcript levels were in agreement with this observation: infected line  <dig> chickens showed a significant downregulation , while there were no such changes in line  <dig> 

on the other hand, tlr <dig> and cd <dig> showed a slight increase in h3k4me <dig> marks after mdv infection while there were no appreciable changes in h3k27me <dig> levels. in keeping with the epigenetic changes, there was a small increase in gene expression in infected birds from both lines .

discussion
immune parameters that are known to play a major role in genetic resistance to mdv are correlated with innate immune responses, such as nk cell activity, production of nitric oxide and cytokines, such as, interferons. recent studies have identified host cytokines such as il- <dig> and ifn-γ that contribute to the initiation and continuation of latency
 <cit> . however, cytokine levels can undergo rapid flux in response to infection, and consistent with this, we did not observe any epigenetic changes associated with these genes in the mhc-congenic lines used in our study . this suggests the existence of other extrinsic factors responsible for transcriptional variations between resistant and susceptible chickens at this stage of the disease.

a global comparison of histone modification levels in the two inbred chicken lines yielded some interesting results. as expected, a majority of sers were found in all the experimental groups, indicating a high level of epigenetic similarity between the lines in addition to inherent genetic similarity. in the case of h3k27me <dig>  the percentage of ubiquitous sers was relatively low , although this was likely due to lower precision of the peak caller for broad chromatin marks. besides, most of the sers detected in a subset of samples corresponded to regions of low enrichment, which may also be the reason behind the relatively low number of differential sers detected in our study.

genes that have been previously associated with md and various other cancers showed differential marks that are either md-induced  or line-specific . the increase in h3k4me <dig> marks around the tss of mx <dig>  a gene with known antiviral properties, appeared to be correlated with upregulated expression in both lines in response to mdv infection. however, lowered overall mrna levels in the resistant line suggest additional factors could be involved in the regulation of this gene. similarly, increased mrna levels of the lymphocyte surface marker ctla <dig> is possibly due to the presence of larger numbers of t cells in mdv infected birds as a result of higher levels of infection. eaf <dig> functions as an apoptosis inducer in addition to being a tumor suppressor, and therefore, its downregulation could contribute to higher tumor incidence rates in line  <dig>  however, it is not clear why a significant increase in h3k27me <dig> levels did not have any effect on transcript levels in the resistant line.

igf2bp <dig> is believed to act by stabilizing the mrna of the c-myc oncogene and therefore, the higher expression of this gene and a more stable c-myc gene product might play a role in increasing md susceptibility in line  <dig> birds via increased cell proliferation and transformation. the matrix metalloprotease mmp <dig> is upregulated after infection in the resistant line  <dig>  similar to the previously observed increase at the neoplastic stage of md. however, mrna levels were similar in the two lines before infection contrary to the difference in h3k4me <dig> levels suggesting that additional factors are responsible for regulating this gene.

the correlation between observed differential histone marks and transcript levels was moderate at best. indeed, differential h3k4me <dig> marks were strongly predictive of gene expression levels but the correlation between h3k27me <dig> and mrna levels was relatively poor. there could be various reasons for this – indeed, h3k27me <dig> levels had a non-linear relationship with gene expression with higher marks showing little difference in the effect on expression. therefore, in this tissue, the levels of h3k27me <dig> may not be a very good indicator of gene expression levels. also, the transcription of these genes might be controlled by other factors with the change in h3k27me <dig> levels only incidental.

bivalent domains were detected on transcriptional regulators bcl <dig>  cited <dig> and egr <dig> and the galanin receptor galr <dig>  the epigenetic and transcriptional signatures observed on these genes indicated that they were poised at the latent stage of the disease, but with crucial differences in the two lines. increased repressive marks in the susceptible line correlated with significant downregulation of the genes, while in line  <dig>  the increase in both marks appeared to compensate for each other with no eventual effect on gene transcription. this suggests that some ‘poised’ bivalent genes can become highly repressed even with a relatively small increase in h3k27me <dig> marks. the change in the chromatin levels could also be correlated with an increase in cell populations having the repressive mark. taken together, the above findings point towards the existence of finely balanced epigenetic control of transcription, which may be necessary to mount a rapid response by the immune system. however, this machinery could potentially be hijacked by a pathogen and result in an aberrant phenotype. the effect of mdv infection on the bivalent domain on galr <dig>  in particular, suggests the repression and potential loss of its anti-proliferative effects. thus, the galanin system possibly plays an important and hitherto unknown role in md progression and could be a novel target for long-term control of the disease.

one of the major players in mdv-induced malignant transformation is meq, a virus-encoded oncoprotein that has diverse functions, e.g. transactivation, chromatin remodeling and regulation of transcription. meq interacts with and sequesters the tumor suppressor protein p <dig>  resulting in the dysregulation of cell-cycle control
 <cit>  and inhibition of the transcriptional and apoptotic activities of the protein
 <cit> . several genes that show epigenetic changes in response to mdv infection have been associated with p <dig>  downregulation of cited <dig> stabilizes the p <dig> protein leading to its accumulation
 <cit> . the bcl <dig> gene product is believed to contribute to lymphomagenesis by inactivation of p53
 <cit> . besides, eaf <dig> has also been shown to interact with and suppress the function of p53
 <cit> . the downregulation of all of the above genes in susceptible birds after mdv infection points towards the increased production of p <dig> and a robust anti-tumor response. that we still observe higher tumor incidence rates in this line, suggests the presence of large amounts of inactivating viral meq protein which, in turn, indicates that increased numbers of md-infected cells are present in the susceptible line at this stage of the disease. a majority of tumors are believed to result from the viral transformation of cd4+ t cells some of which are infected at the latent stage of md
 <cit> . the larger number of virus-infected cells produced in the susceptible line is possibly due to lowered immunocompetence as a result of the early stages of infection. thus, a more detailed investigation of the early cytolytic stage of md is necessary to shed further light on the causes behind the divergent response to md observed in these birds.

whole tissues represent a mixture of various cell populations, and observed epigenetic changes might be due to a change in chromatin marks in a particular cell type or a variation in the relative number of cells carrying active or repressive histone marks. however, such in vivo studies are representative of the host response at a systems level wherein different cell types might interact in a cooperative manner to fight infection. thus, while the study of pure cell populations is likely to yield greater discriminative power, the investigation of tissue macroenvironments is, perhaps, closer to reality.

this study focused on the thymus tissue as it is a major immune organ and contains a significant population of t lymphocytes in various stages of differentiation. our earlier study of the mdv-induced transcriptome in these birds indicated the presence of line-specific differences at the latent stage of md
 <cit> . in addition, birds susceptible to md suffer thymic atrophy during the early stages of infection
 <cit> , indicating the importance of understanding changes in this organ to elucidate the mechanisms involved in disease progression. ongoing studies in our lab include other tissues, e.g. spleen
 <cit> , and a time-course through the various stages of infection, to further investigate the systemic effects of md and the epigenetic basis of md resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
we studied the effect of latent mdv infection on two chromatin modifications in inbred chicken lines exhibiting different degrees of resistance to md. several genes showed changes in histone enrichment and this response was often significantly different between the two chicken lines. a detailed analysis of co-localization patterns of the chromatin marks revealed the presence of bivalent domains on a number of immune-related transcriptional regulators. more importantly, these domains showed marked changes in response to mdv infection and provide further evidence of the far-reaching epigenetic effects of md. our results suggest putative roles for the gal system in md progression. a majority of the differential chromatin marks are also suggestive of increased levels of viral infection in the susceptible line symptomatic of lowered immunocompetence in these birds at early stages of the disease. in summary, our study provides further insight into the mechanisms of md progression while revealing a complex landscape of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. further work is necessary to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms of md, but our results suggest that this is a promising step towards a deeper understanding of this complex disease.
