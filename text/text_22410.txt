BACKGROUND
type  <dig> diabetes , a disease state characterized by impaired insulin sensitivity and hyperglycemia, is one of the world’s leading causes of mortality and morbidity  <cit> . in recent years, genome-wide association studies  have had success in identifying susceptibility loci for type  <dig> diabetes and related traits in humans  <cit> . these studies establish associations between markers, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms , and disease. however, they typically lack the resolution needed to identify causal variants, because snps may exist in linkage disequilibrium with multiple protein-coding loci as well as with non-coding gene-regulatory elements that can act over a long distance  <cit> . mouse models of diabetes and obesity can serve as convenient platforms to functionally probe a small number of candidate genes  <cit> , but this approach is expensive and slow, limiting the number of genes that can be readily assessed.

the biochemical pathways involved in growth and metabolism are ancient and well conserved across the animal kingdom from c. elegans and drosophila to rodents and humans  <cit> . analogous to insulin and glucagon in vertebrates, drosophila insulin-like peptides  and adipokinetic hormone  regulate circulating glucose homeostasis. in addition, many tissues known to be important in type  <dig> diabetes have functional analogs in drosophila including blood, adipose tissue and liver, skeletal muscle, pancreatic beta cells, brain, and kidney  <cit> . indeed, drosophila melanogaster raised on diets high in sugar exhibit hallmark features of type  <dig> diabetes including insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia, and increased fat storage  <cit> .

off-the-shelf genetic tools in drosophila, including mutations and inducible rna interference , allow the functions of specific genes to be rapidly queried; a drosophila genetic approach has recently been used to follow up a small-scale gwas for alzheimer pathology  <cit> . here we make use of the advantages of drosophila as a model system for exploration of whole-animal metabolism. starting from a subset of previously published human snps and regions associated with disease risk, we utilize drosophila to screen candidate genes in each region in an unbiased manner. we provide functional evidence that disruption of some of these genes can predispose the flies to dietary sucrose-induced lethality. we show in one region that hhex may contribute to type  <dig> diabetes phenotypes including hyperglycemia and insulin insensitivity; in addition, our data suggests two neighboring genes may also contribute to the risk identified by gwas. thus, in addition to implicating specific genes as disease drivers, our work demonstrates the power of drosophila to provide rapid, functional, diet- and environment-sensitive assays for gwas follow-up studies and to deconvolute regions that contain multiple risk loci.

RESULTS
fly orthologs of human genes in disease risk-associated regions
we focused on a set of  <dig> human genomic regions in which snps have been associated with type  <dig> diabetes disease status  <cit>  as well as related quantitative traits , including levels of fasting blood glucose  <cit> , triglycerides  <cit> , low-density lipoprotein   <cit> , and high-density lipoprotein   <cit> . we included the latter snps since there is considerable overlap between mechanisms that regulate lipid and glucose metabolism. beginning with the  <dig> human genes located within approximately  <dig> kb of each snp, we identified fly orthologs as inferred by ensembl’s phylogenetic analyses   <cit>  and found that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate human genes—within  <dig> of the  <dig> human genomic regions—have fly orthologs with one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many orthology relationships. in total, we identified  <dig> fly orthologs corresponding to  <dig> human genes under consideration. human gwas traits, associated index snps, genomic regions, candidate genes, and fly orthologs are listed in table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>

screen for modifiers of sucrose tolerance
we and others have previously shown that flies fed high-sugar diets, including a  <dig>  m sucrose diet, exhibit diabetes-like phenotypes  <cit> . additionally, flies die as larvae when fed very high levels of dietary sucrose , but survival to pupariation is comparable between flies fed  <dig>  m and  <dig>  m sucrose diets . we hypothesized that knocking down a gene that mediates sucrose tolerance would affect larval viability differently on high- vs. low-sucrose diets. such a gene would be required for survival to pupariation on a  <dig>  m sucrose diet, but may prove dispensable on a control  <dig>  m sucrose diet.

to test this hypothesis and to identify modifiers of the sucrose intolerance phenotype, we screened knockdowns of the selected genes  using the now-classic gal4/uas system  <cit> . fly lines containing inducible rna-interference  elements were acquired for most of these genes; multiple fly lines were available for many loci, and a total of  <dig> rnai fly lines were tested. we used tubp-gal <dig> to direct broad expression of gal <dig>  which in turn induces broad expression of the rnai-encoding transgene. sucrose tolerance was then assessed by  scoring pupariation rates relative to non-rnai controls and  comparing high-sucrose vs. low-sucrose feeding. an important strength of this approach is that we can distinguish between sucrose-dependent and sucrose-independent toxicity. the results of the screen are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and summarized in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and table  <dig> 

we defined hits as crosses in which knockdown resulted in statistically significant sucrose-sensitive toxicity at a  <dig>  threshold. we defined strong hits as results that had p-values less than  <dig>  × 10– <dig>  corresponding to a bonferroni adjustment for the total of  <dig> lines for which sucrose tolerance could be assessed .  <dig> of the screened lines were hits, corresponding to  <dig> human genes;  <dig> of these were strong hits, corresponding to  <dig> human genes. as a control, we verified that the relative survival to pupariation was similar for flies fed  <dig>  m sucrose vs.  <dig>  m sucrose food for the gd and kk genetic backgrounds  used in the study .

regions containing a single candidate gene
the approximately 100 kb radius window we applied included only a single human gene at  <dig> regions. at each of these regions, it seems plausible that variants in this single gene are causative for the associated traits.  <dig> of these regions were tested with fly orthologs . seven fly orthologs were identified as hits in at least one cross. strong hits corresponded to pparg and tcf7l <dig> , lipc , and lpl ; orthologs of adamts <dig> and slc30a <dig>  and trib <dig>  were also hits. the 7/ <dig> hit rate at single-gene regions indicates that our model likely reflects at least some important aspects of human t2d and related qts, and that our assay can provide useful modifier data.

not all single-gene regions tested positive in our drosophila assay: orthologs of galnt <dig>  cdkal <dig>  and jazf <dig> failed to display modifier activity . this may be due to several factors. first, the rnai constructs and insertions used work with differing efficacy, at least in part likely due to their random insertion sites within the genome  <cit> . consistent with this phenomenon, some rnai lines targeting the same drosophila gene gave discordant results in our assay; most commonly, one line showed modifier activity and another did not. second, phylogenetic inference of orthology may not be correct. indeed, ensembl’s inferences were refined while our study was underway. third, the gwas result may be a false positive, or the true causative variant may lie outside of the window we initially selected or may be undetected within the region. however, galnt <dig> acts in metabolic pathways  <cit>  and a coding mutation in cdkal <dig> has been closely correlated with t2d risk in humans  <cit> . fourth, our screening approach may not identify loci that are risk factors due to upregulation. lastly, failure of drosophila to confirm modifier status for several of these regions may reflect limitations of using flies to explore gwas.

regions containing multiple candidate genes
at the remaining regions, our approximately 100 kb radius window defined more than one candidate human gene, many with fly orthologs. the region near rs <dig> contains the gene gck, encoding glucokinase, which is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and proper glucose metabolism. gck mutations are causative alleles in a monogenic form of diabetes  <cit> , making it a strong candidate to further validate our approach. indeed, sucrose-specific toxicity was strongly enhanced by knockdown of all but one of the four putative fly orthologs of gck .

for other regions we tested orthologs of multiple human genes, and at six of the remaining regions our sucrose toxicity screen implicated a single human gene ortholog. these genes were thada and igf2bp <dig> , celsr <dig> , nrbp <dig> , slc12a <dig> and lipg . at six regions our screen did not identify any hits. while this may be explained in part by potential lack of sensitivity in our system, in all cases these regions included other genes we were not able to test.

at nine regions, our screen implicated more than one human gene. this may reflect a lack of specificity of this assay, perhaps due to off-target effects of the rnai constructs or differences in insect and mammalian physiology. on the other hand, these results highlight the fact that model organism screening has the ability to identify multiple modifier loci within a single region and at the level of individual genes. of particular utility, genes that are tightly linked in humans can be subjected to individual functional testing using specific rnai knockdown. a striking example of this is a region at 10q <dig>  that contains ide, kif <dig>  and hhex, three genes with clear one-to-one fly orthologs. genome-wide scans  <cit>  have consistently reported snp signals associated with t2d near this region. attention has focused on hhex, which has been most closely linked with these signals  <cit> , and which encodes a metabolism-related hox-class transcription factor. indeed, our screening identified cg7056—which we refer to here as dhhex—as the most robust modifier of sucrose-mediated lethality in our study .

we also identified drosophila orthologs of the neighboring genes ide and kif11—drosophila genes ide and klp61f—as modifiers . intriguingly, ide knockout mice exhibit hyperglycemia and insulin insensitivity in an age-dependent manner  <cit> . kif <dig> has also been knocked out in mice but is embryonic lethal; metabolic effects of partial loss of kif <dig> have not been characterized  <cit> . our data suggest that ide and kif <dig> may contribute to patients’ metabolic risk. their role may be obscured by the high risk conferred by neighboring hhex locus; the three loci may act independently, or perhaps variations in copy number affect the three loci to increase patient risk.

further characterization of dhhex: diet
we next used drosophila to further explore aspects of dhhex’s role in the response to high dietary sucrose. raised on a variety of feeding conditions  tubp>rnaidhhex flies remained comparable to wild type on a number of stressful diets including diets containing hydrogen peroxide and silver nitrate and, notably, a high-fat diet. we observed elevated lethality when tubp>rnaidhhex flies were raised on high-salt diets . this result suggests an impaired ability to respond to hyperosmolar conditions that may contribute to sucrose-dependent lethality. to better understand the role of dhhex specifically in glucose metabolism, we used dietary glucosamine to explore the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway , a primary pathway of glucose metabolism. the hbp has been implicated in mechanisms of glucose toxicity  <cit>  and dietary glucosamine increases hbp flux in flies  <cit> . tubp>rnaidhhex flies proved glucosamine-intolerant: the addition of  <dig>  m glucosamine to a control diet resulted in failure to pupariate. the ability of low levels of glucosamine to cause lethality suggests that glucose metabolism is indeed a primary effector of dietary sucrose toxicity in tubp>rnaidhhex flies.

further characterization of dhhex: tissues
we next used targeted knockdown to determine which tissues require normal dhhex activity in the face of high dietary sucrose . mammalian studies have implicated hhex function in diverse tissues and organs including liver, heart, pancreas, thyroid, and hematopoietic cells  <cit> . we used a panel of tissue-selective gal <dig> lines to direct expression of the uas-rnaidhhex transgene in specific tissues: dilp2-gal <dig> targets insulin producing cells , cg-gal <dig> targets several tissues including the fat body , dot-gal <dig> targets several tissues including nephrocytes  and gut, gmh <dig> targets heart, srp.hemo-gal <dig> targets hemocytes  as well as nephrocytes, snsgcn-gal <dig> targets nephrocytes, esg-gal <dig> targets several cell types including midgut stem cells, myoia-gal <dig> targets differentiated midgut, and byn-gal <dig> targets hindgut. flies carrying a gal <dig> driver plus uas-rnaidhhex were raised on high-sucrose diets along with control animals, and the number of knockdown to non-knockdown animals surviving to pupariation or eclosion on high or low sucrose was scored. of the three distinct uas-rnaidhhex lines we used in the initial screen, we focused on the v <dig> line, which exhibited the most survival of knockdown flies on  <dig>  m sucrose when driven by tubp-gal <dig> 

knockdown of dhhex in the heart, hemocytes, nephrocytes, hindgut, and differentiated midgut did not affect viability on high-sucrose feeding compared to low-sucrose feeding, and perhaps surprisingly, neither did knockdown in the insulin producing cells or the fat body . however, knockdown driven by either dot-gal <dig> or esg-gal <dig> did affect survival to eclosion in a sugar-sensitive manner . both of these drivers express in a range of tissues but one point of overlap in their domains is in the midgut stem cells.

further characterization of dhhex: metabolics
given the fat body’s important role in metabolism, we profiled hemolymph  glucose, body size, and whole-animal triglyceride levels in cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig> wandering third-instar and adult flies reared on  <dig>  m sucrose. dicer- <dig>  overexpression was included to enhance rnai efficacy  <cit> . female flies were studied because this experimental genotype is male-lethal.

both larval and adult cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig>  dcr- <dig> flies were significantly smaller than controls when reared on a high-sucrose diet throughout development . since flies have a single receptor that is orthologous to both human insulin and human igf <dig> receptors, and since this receptor controls both glucose homeostasis and growth  <cit> , the smaller body size of knockdown animals suggests that cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig>  dcr- <dig> flies have decreased insulin signaling activity and hence increased insulin resistance when confronted with high dietary sucrose. consistent with this view, wandering  cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig>  dcr- <dig> larvae were hyperglycemic after high-dietary-sucrose rearing . intriguingly, in both cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig>  dcr- <dig> larvae and adults, hyperglycemia and reduced body size were accompanied by significantly lower triglyceride levels when compared to controls .

CONCLUSIONS
to date, genome-wide scans for genes and alleles that contribute to metabolic disease risk have identified numerous candidates, but functional follow-up studies have been more difficult to perform in mammalian systems. we hypothesized that human genes involved in susceptibility to developing t2d and related traits can be prioritized by knocking down their fly orthologs and assaying sucrose-sensitive lethality. evidence in support of our hypothesis includes the fact that this assay identifies gck, a gene known to cause a monogenic form of diabetes, and the fact that sucrose-sensitive lethality correlates with metabolic abnormalities in the flies. to our knowledge, this is the first large-scale functional study of metabolic-trait candidate genes identified by gwas analysis, and the first to specifically address an interaction between genes and environment.

through more detailed analysis of the function of the drosophila hhex ortholog, we have shown that this gene plays an important role in whole-animal metabolism in this system through its effects in the fat body—a functional analog of mammalian liver and adipose tissue. loss of dhhex results in insulin resistance and hyperglycemia and, interestingly, a reduction of whole-animal triglyceride levels in this system. it has been proposed that the conversion of fatty acids into triglycerides may protect against tissue lipotoxicity  <cit> ; the hyperglycemia observed in cg>rnaidhhex-v <dig> flies suggests dhhex may play a role in determining the capacity of the fly to store energy as triglycerides. we additionally showed that there are multiple other candidate genes for t2d and related qts  that have diet-dependent roles in overall organismal viability. further systematic study of these genes, including t2d candidate genes such as pparg, ide, and kif <dig>  may help elucidate their molecular functions in their respective pathways. since many fundamental aspects of metabolism have been conserved during evolution, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these functions may be similar in humans as in flies; whether this is true will, of course, have to be determined case by case.

in general, drosophila offers a rich resource for providing rapid, inexpensive, whole-animal tests of gene function. in addition to screening candidate genes identified by gwas approaches, this same approach could prove useful, as whole genome sequencing becomes more common, for identifying specific mutations that are causative rather than simply correlated. perhaps its most important advantage is the ability to assess all candidates in an unbiased manner, identifying surprising hits and untangling complex regions.
