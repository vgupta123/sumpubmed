BACKGROUND
evc was first identified through a positional cloning approach as the gene defective in patients with the recessive disorder ellis-van creveld syndrome   <cit> . the consistent features of this condition are short ribs, short limbs, postaxial polydactyly, dental abnormalities and nail dysplasia. failure to find evc mutations in a number of consanguineous evc families mapping to the same region of chromosome  <dig> led to investigation of other genes in the evc critical interval and to the identification of mutations in a second gene, evc <dig>  which is in close proximity to evc  <cit> . the two genes are in divergent orientation with their translational start sites separated by only  <dig>  kb in the human genome  <cit>  and  <dig>  kb in the mouse  <cit> . the phenotype associated with mutations in either of the two genes is indistinguishable indicating that evc and evc <dig> act in a common pathway  <cit> .

mice lacking evc, like patients with ellis-van creveld syndrome, have short limbs, short ribs and dental abnormalities. on histological analysis of the growth plate, they have epiphyseal shortening and defective periosteal induction compatible with a defect in indian hedgehog  signalling. studying expression of ihh and its downstream targets by in situ hybridization demonstrated normal ihh expression but diminished mrna levels of the ihh downstream targets, patched <dig> , gli <dig> and pthrp. in vitro studies treating mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and chondrocytes with the hedgehog  agonist purmorphamine confirmed that hh signal transduction is defective in cells lacking evc  <cit> . thus evc is essential for ihh signalling in the cartilage growth plate.

we have previously shown that evc localises to the base of primary cilia  <cit> . seminal studies demonstrated that primary cilia are required for sonic hedgehog  signalling  <cit>  and subsequent studies have confirmed that this is also the case for ihh signalling  <cit> . proteins are transported from the base to the tip of the cilium by anterograde intraflagellar transport  and back to the base by retrograde ift, outward transport being mediated by a kinesin motor and retrograde transport by a dynein motor. key components of hh signalling such as ptch <dig> and smoothened  have been shown to enter and leave the cilium depending on the activation status of the pathway  <cit> . hh signalling is ultimately meditated by the gli transcription factor family of proteins which are observed in the cilia as well as in the nucleus  <cit> . in the absence of hh signal, gli <dig> is processed into a repressor form gli3r, transcription of gli <dig> targets being dependent on the balance between activator full-length gli <dig> and gli3r. gli <dig> processing is reduced both when anterograde ift is disrupted and when retrograde ift is disrupted  <cit> . in evc-/- mice, in contrast to ift mutants, gli <dig> processing appears normal on protein extracts from e <dig>  limbs though as with the ift mutants, the expression of gene targets of hh signalling such as ptch <dig> and gli <dig> are diminished  <cit> . in this study we demonstrate that, in addition to evc, evc <dig> is also required for hh signal transduction. we have shown direct interaction between evc and evc <dig>  have investigated evc and evc <dig> subcellular localisation and discuss the significance of these findings.

RESULTS
evc <dig> is a positive regulator of hh signal transduction
evc is known to be a positive regulator of hh signalling both in the cartilage growth plate and in cultured chondrocytes and mefs. the observation that evc and evc <dig> mutations are associated with the same phenotype indicates that evc <dig> is likely to be a positive regulator of hh signalling. we have tested this hypothesis using sirna to knockdown evc <dig> expression in light <dig>  hh reporter cells  <cit> . these cells are a mouse fibroblast line that stably express a gli-dependent firefly luciferase and a tk renilla luciferase control to allow quantitation of hh pathway activation. light <dig> cells transfected with evc <dig> sirna had reduced evc <dig> protein levels and had a diminished response to the smo agonist purmorphamine compared to controls transfected with a non-targeting sirna . this result was confirmed in osteoblast-derived mc3t <dig> cells co-transfected with the gli-dependent firefly luciferase and tk renilla luciferase plasmids . we also assessed expression of the hh target gene, ptch <dig> compared to expression of the hprt housekeeping gene in evc <dig> null mefs by rt-pcr. ptch <dig> expression in response to purmorphamine in evc <dig> mutant mefs was reduced compared to wild-type mef controls . since purmorphamine activates smo, these data confirm that, like evc, evc <dig> is a positive regulator of the hh signalling pathway.

evc and evc <dig> are homologues resulting from an ancient gene duplication
we investigated what the protein sequence of evc and evc <dig> could tell us about their relationship to each other and to their function.

evc  has a predicted signal anchor sequence and evc <dig>  has a predicted signal peptide sequence and a second predicted transmembrane region , the only feature of the proteins c-terminal to these transmembrane sequences being coiled-coil regions. sequence analysis predicts that they have resulted from an ancient duplication of a pre-existing gene whose occurrence predates the radiation of most metazoan lineages . evc <dig> was identified as showing significant sequence similarity to evc over approximately  <dig> amino acids when the latter was used to query the non-redundant protein sequence database using psi-blast . next, evc and evc <dig> orthologues were each found as gene predictions in the genome assemblies of amphioxus , sea urchin , gastropod snail  and sea anemone . for example, a blast search of the nonredundant sequence database with sea anemone evc <dig> as query revealed significant similarity  with human evc <dig> over  <dig> amino acids. since these invertebrate species and mammals last shared a common ancestor about  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , this indicates that the gene duplication giving rise to evc and evc <dig> occurred in an early metazoan species. in amphioxus, sea urchin and snail, but not sea anemone, genome assemblies these two genes, as in vertebrates, lie in close proximity in a 5' to 5' head-to-head arrangement. this arrangement, and the close proximity of their transcription start sites, suggests that evc and evc <dig> share a bidirectional promoter  <cit> . this, in turn, suggests that evc and evc <dig> need to be co-ordinately expressed in order to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry, or because they function in the same biological pathway. an evc-like gene is also predicted in the placozoan, trichoplax adhaerens, the most basal metazoan known  <cit>  thereby confirming the presence of evc-like genes in the earliest metazoans. evc and evc <dig> orthologues are absent from drosophila and caenorhabditis elegans genomes, indicating that they have been deleted since they last shared an ancestor with mammals.

direct protein interaction between evc and evc2
to search for evc-interacting proteins we screened a cdna library derived from e <dig> mouse embryos by the yeast two-hybrid assay using evc sequence encoding amino acids  <dig> -  <dig> as bait. this screen did not identify any known hh pathway components but did identify evc <dig> as an evc-interacting partner. in order to map this interaction, deletion constructs for both evc and evc <dig> were generated and used in a directed yeast-two-hybrid assay . significant binding was observed with the following evc constructs: expressing amino acid  <dig> -  <dig>   <dig> -  <dig>   <dig> -  <dig> and  <dig> -  <dig> and evc <dig>  no growth was observed with an evc construct expressing amino acids  <dig> -  <dig> and restricted growth with the construct coding for amino acids  <dig> -  <dig>  thus interaction was observed for the four constructs containing the third and fourth coiled-coil regions but restricted interaction with the construct containing only the first three coiled-coil regions and no interaction detected with the constructs containing only the first two coiled-coil regions. whilst the fifth and sixth coiled-coil regions were contained within constructs for which interaction was observed they were not tested independently of the fourth coiled-coil region. significant binding was observed with the evc <dig> construct expressing amino acids  <dig> -  <dig> and evc . this portion of the evc <dig> protein contains the first three predicted coiled-coil regions; interaction was not assessed for these three coiled-coil regions independently. we attempted to express full-length evc and evc <dig> proteins in mammalian cells to test for their interaction by co-immunoprecipitation . full-length proteins could not be expressed at high levels in mammalian cells and were insoluble in standard co-ip buffers. therefore we co-expressed the shortest constructs for which strong interaction was observed  in hek  <dig> cells with flag and myc-tags, respectively, to test whether evc and evc <dig> interact in a mammalian expression system. hek  <dig> cells are ciliated renal cells  <cit> . using antibodies against the tags, each protein was bound independently to protein g sepharose beads. the beads were then extensively washed prior to elution of the interacting proteins and we detected co-immunoprecipitaton of the corresponding interacting partner by western blot. evc and evc <dig> co-immunoprecipated with each other but not with vector or antibody controls confirming their interaction .

evc and evc <dig> colocalize at the basal body and cilia
we have previously observed evc at the distal end of the basal body in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . to study evc <dig> localization we raised a new polyclonal anti-evc <dig> antibody, r <dig>  and we observed evc <dig> co-localization with evc at the basal body in fibroblast, osteoblast and chondrocyte cultures and in renal derived imcd <dig> cells . in addition, we observed diffuse pericentriolar staining for evc <dig> . specificity of the evc <dig> immunostaining was demonstrated by antigen blocking and immunostaining in null evc <dig> mefs . on testing additional cell lines to ascertain evc/evc <dig> localization we observed evc along the length of the ciliary axoneme in all cilia of osteoblast-derived mc3t <dig> cells . in these cells co-staining detected evc <dig> mainly at the base of cilia . co-transfection of evc and evc2-gfp constructs into imcd <dig> cells detected both proteins along the length of the cilium , supporting the observations in mc3t <dig> cells. co-transfection into mc3t <dig> and nih3t <dig> cells also resulted in both proteins localizing to the cilia . however, we did not observe basal body or cilia localization when transfecting constructs expressing either tagged evc or evc <dig> individually .

evc and evc <dig> topography in the cilia membrane
evc <dig> has a predicted signal peptide sequence and a second predicted transmembrane region . to address whether evc <dig> spans the cilia membrane and demonstrate its orientation in the membrane we immunostained co-transfected, non-permeabilized imcd <dig> cells with antibodies generated against peptides n-terminal and c-terminal of the second transmembrane domain . y- <dig> antibody was raised against a peptide near the n-terminus of evc <dig> between the two predicted transmembrane domains and r <dig> against a c-terminal region of evc <dig>  . y- <dig> detected evc2-gfp along the length of the cilium in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells demonstrating that this portion of evc <dig> is extracellular . however, r <dig> only detects cilial evc2-gfp in permeabilized cells, indicating that the region that is c-terminal of the transmembrane domain and detected by this antibody is intracellular . s43b antibody  detects native evc in cilia in permeabilized mc3t <dig> cells, but does not detect evc in non-permeabilized mc3t <dig> cells  or in non-permeabilzed co-transfected imcd <dig> cells . this indicates that the region of evc c-terminal of the transmembrane domain is also intracellular. thus, the regions of evc and evc <dig> that we have shown by co-ip to interact are intracellular whilst the n-terminus of evc <dig> is extracellular .

evc <dig> is required for localization of evc at the base of primary cilia
since both evc and evc <dig> are co-dependent for cilia localization of expressed proteins, we tested if evc <dig> is required for cilia localization of evc in evc <dig> null cells. mefs derived from evc <dig> mutant mice do not produce any evc <dig> transcript or protein . evc and evc <dig> are both detected at the base of primary cilia in wild-type mefs . despite the presence of evc transcript and protein  evc was not detected at the base of cilia in evc <dig> null mefs. this confirms that evc <dig> is essential for evc cilia localization.

primary cilia of cells lacking evc appear structurally normal
although cilia in mice lacking evc look normal on standard microscopy  <cit>  the possibility remained that the hh signalling defect could be secondary to a structural abnormality of cilia. we therefore examined cilia structure in chondrocytes using transmission electron microscopy . in the basal body region, cilia from mutant chondrocytes showed the normal configuration of  <dig> triplet microtubules with transition fibers radiating from the triplets at the distal end of the basal body . the champagne glass structures that connect the microtubule doublets to the ciliary membrane seen in the transition zone  <cit>  are present in the mutant chondrocytes . sections through the mid-portion of the cilia show  <dig> microtubule doublets with normal orientation and structure. in the distal region of the cilia there is some collapse of the microtubule ring in chondrocyte cilia from both wild-type and evc-/- mouse , a feature that has been reported before in normal cilia  <cit> . all observed cilia showed complete triplet microtubule structure in the basal body and doublet microtubules in the ciliary region. no structural differences were observed between the cilia from wild-type and evc-/- chondrocytes.

evc <dig>  but not evc, is found in the nucleus
evc and evc <dig> are detected on cilia in several different cell types by immunostaining. to determine if evc and evc <dig> are located elsewhere in the cell we performed subcellular fractionation on mefs derived from wild-type and null mice. the purity of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein samples was confirmed using antibodies to alpha tubulin and c-jun, respectively . specificity of the antibodies to evc and evc <dig> was confirmed by the absence of bands on western blots of mefs derived from null mice. we detected full-length evc <dig>  both in the cytoplasmic and in the nuclear fractions but only detected full-length evc  in cytoplasmic fractions.

discussion
the fact that mutations in evc and evc <dig> cause the same human phenotype, the chondrodysplasia ellis-van creveld syndrome, suggested that these two proteins act in the same pathway. we have shown that evc and evc <dig> are both positive regulators of the hh pathway and that they interact directly with each other. the hh pathway defect described in evc and evc <dig> mutants is downstream of the action of purmorphamine. it is known that purmorphamine directly activates smo and promotes its entry onto the cilium  <cit> . thus, both evc and evc <dig> are positive regulators that act on, or downstream of, smo in hh signal transduction.

analysis of evc and evc <dig> gene sequences predicts that they have arisen from an ancient duplication. conservation of their 5' to 5' head to head arrangement and proximity of transcriptional start sites suggests that evc and evc <dig> need to be co-ordinately expressed in order to maintain an appropriate stoichiometry, or because they function in the same biological pathway. it is interesting to note that evc-like genes are absent from organisms that do not use cilia for hh signalling  or that do not have hh signalling .

we studied evc and evc <dig> subcellular localization and observed that evc <dig> co-localizes with evc at the base of primary cilia in fibroblast and chondrocyte cultures and in renal-derived cell lines. on testing additional cell lines we observed additional evc along the length of the ciliary axoneme in the osteoblast-derived mc3t <dig> cell line. one interpretation of the difference between the immunofluorescence analysis in this cell line and other cell lines, primary cell cultures and on tissue cryosections is that the amount of native protein normally present in cilia is below the sensitivity of immunofluorescence in most cells. indeed, mc3t <dig> cells do express higher levels of evc than other cells studied . cilia localization of co-expressed protein from constructs is in keeping with this interpretation but another possibility is that localization of evc and evc <dig> to the cilia is dependent on additional factors, analogous to the way in which localization of ptch <dig>  the hh receptor, and smo localization changes on addition of ligand. ptch <dig> localizes to the cilium in the absence of ligand, but on ligand binding leaves the cilium upon which smo enters the cilium and in turn regulates processing and activation of the three gli transcription factors. we did not observe a change in evc or evc <dig> localization in mc3t <dig> and imcd <dig> cells after treatment with purmorphamine  which suggests that cilia localization of evc and evc <dig> is not dependent on pathway activation status.

the observation that overexpressed evc and evc <dig> proteins localize to the cilium after co-transfection, but not when expressed individually, suggests that basal body and cilia localization is dependent on the interaction between evc and evc <dig>  this was confirmed using mefs from evc <dig> null mice where evc is present but does not localize to the base of primary cilia. co-dependent localization of evc and evc <dig> could explain why mutations in either gene result in an indistinguishable patient phenotype. given that both evc and evc <dig> possess transmembrane domains, observing them on the cilium led us to question whether they span the cilia membrane and, if so, their orientation in the membrane. we addressed this by comparison of immunofluorescence on permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells with antibodies generated against peptides n-terminal and c-terminal of the transmembrane domain of evc <dig>  these confirmed that evc <dig> spans the cilia membrane and that the n-terminal portion is extracellular. evc has a predicted signal anchor sequence and comparison of immunofluorescence signal on permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells demonstrated that evc is intracellular. furthermore, the regions of evc and evc <dig> that we have demonstrated to interact are both intracellular .

a question that arises when a hh signalling defect results from loss of a cilia protein is whether this defect is due to a cilia abnormality or due to specific modulation of hh signal transduction. ultrastructural analysis of cilia of evc mutant cells does not revealed any abnormalities suggesting that the mutant phenotype does not result from defective cilia but rather that evc is a specific modifier of hh signal transduction.

in addition to the cilia localization, we detected evc <dig> in mef nuclear extracts by western blotting. we detected evc in cytoplasmic but not in nuclear extracts suggesting that evc does not enter the nucleus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that evc is present at undetectable levels in the nucleus. evc and evc <dig> were not observed in the nucleus by immunostaining, but a diffuse nuclear distribution may be difficult to distinguish from background staining. also, overexpressed proteins were not observed in the nucleus when expressed alone or when co-expressed leading us to conclude that additional factors are required to transport evc <dig> into the nucleus, a process that may depend on activation of the hh pathway.

the presence of evc <dig> both in the ciliary membrane and in the nucleus is intriguing. there is a precedent for proteolytic processing and translocation to the nucleus of the c-terminal region of a cilia membrane protein in polycystin  <dig>   <cit> . after cleavage, the c-terminal peptide of pc <dig> moves to the nucleus where it associates with stat <dig> and p <dig> to activate gene transcription. the nuclear localization and the n-terminal extracellular portion of evc <dig> may indicate an analogous role for evc <dig> in the regulation of hh target gene transcription in response to extracellular signals.

one of the many recent surprises regarding hh signalling was the finding that the gli transcription factors localize to cilia as well as the nucleus. further experiments are required to determine whether ellis-van creveld proteins move in conjunction with gli proteins or via an independent pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we have previously shown that evc is a positive modulator of ihh signalling at the growth plate acting at or downstream of smo. here we have shown that evc <dig> is also required for hh signalling and that there is a direct physical interaction between the two proteins.

we have shown that they localize to the membrane of primary cilia in a co-dependent manner and have deduced their orientation within the cilia membrane, the c-terminus of each being intracellular and only evc <dig> having an extracellular portion. we have found that evc <dig> is present in the nucleus but cannot detect evc in nuclear extracts. we conclude that evc and evc <dig> are interacting proteins that together modulate hh signal transduction.
