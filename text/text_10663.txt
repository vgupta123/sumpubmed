BACKGROUND
the evolutionarily conserved notch signalling pathway mediates direct cell-to-cell communication in a wide variety of developmental contexts in different species and regulates cell-fate decisions, proliferation and apoptosis  <cit> . notch genes encode large transmembrane proteins that act at the surface of a cell as receptors for proteins encoded by the delta and serrate  genes. like notch, the transmembrane ligands delta and serrate have a variable number of egf-like repeats in their extracellular domains  <cit> . upon ligand binding, the intracellular portion of notch is proteolytically released, translocates to the nucleus, and by complexing with a transcriptional regulator of the csl family, rbp-jκ in mouse, activates transcription of target genes  <cit> .

notch modification by o-linked fucose residues is essential for notch signalling in vivo both in drosophila and mammals  <cit> . o-linked fucose residues are attached to specific ser or thr residues in epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats of notch  <cit> . the transfer of fucose to these residues is catalyzed by protein o-fucosyltransferase  <dig> , which is encoded by ofut <dig> in drosophila and pofut <dig> in mammals  <cit> . in addition, in certain cell types pofut <dig> acts independently from its fucosyltransferase activity as a chaperone and is required for notch folding and presentation on the cell surface  <cit> . pofut <dig> null  mutant mouse embryos are severely growth retarded on e <dig>  and die around e <dig> with a phenotype resembling embryos lacking the common downstream effector rbp-jκ or presenilins, which are required for the release of the intracellular domains of notch receptors, suggesting that notch signalling is globally inactivated through all four mammalian notch receptors  <cit> .

o-linked fucose residues on egf repeats serve as substrates for further modification by fringe  proteins, fucose-specific beta <dig>   <dig> n-acetylglucosaminyltransferases that modify notch in the trans-golgi and modulate the interactions of notch receptors with their ligands  <cit> . notch modification by fringe differentially affects the ability of ligands to activate notch receptors in a context-dependent manner  <cit> . for example, in the drosophila wing disc fringe potentiates a cell's ability to respond to delta and inhibits its ability to respond to serrate  <cit> , whereas in the presomitic mesoderm of mouse embryos lunatic fringe  appears to attenuate delta1-like -mediated activation of notch <dig>  <cit> . in vitro lfng may enhance dll1-mediated signalling and inhibits jagged1-mediated signalling through notch <dig>  or potentiate both jagged1- and dll1-mediated signalling via notch <dig>  <cit>  indicating a complex modulation of notch activity by differential glycosylation.

the context-dependent effects of notch receptor glycosylation by lfng suggest that different developmental processes might have different requirements for o-fucosylation by pofut <dig>  however, this cannot be assessed due to the early embryonic lethality of pofut <dig> null mutants. here, we identify a spontaneous mutation in the pofut <dig> gene that leads to a hypomorphic allele. mice homozygous for this allele display defects in the axial skeleton consistent with the known patterning functions of notch in somitogenesis, but have no apparent defects in other early notch-dependent processes such as left-right determination, vascular remodelling or neuronal differentiation. our results suggest that aspects of somite formation and patterning that depend on notch function are processes that are most sensitive to the level of pofut <dig> in early mammalian embryos.

RESULTS
cax, a novel spontaneous mouse mutation affecting axial skeleton development
a new recessive autosomal mutation named "compact axial skeleton" , causing kinky and shortened tails and shortened body length, arose spontaneously in a breeding colony of c3h/hej mice at the jackson laboratory. on the c3h/hej background the cax mutation causes severe shortening of the tail and body axis, whereas on the mixed genetic background of our linkage cross the phenotype was variable, and ranged from normal external appearance to almost complete absence of the tail and shortened body axis . most likely the variability seen in the backcross progeny is attributable to strain background effects. skeletal preparations showed that even externally normal mice carried mild malformations of the vertebral column . skeletal malformations were found along the entire length of the vertebral column  and included fused ribs , reduced or missing pedicles  and split or hemi-vertebrae . at earlier stages, mutant embryos had clearly discernable somite borders, however, in some embryos somite size varied considerably . the observed defects are indicative of defective somite formation and compartmentalization suggesting that the cax mutation affects a gene involved in early somite patterning.

identification of pofut <dig> as the gene affected by the cax mutation
to identify the gene affected by the cax mutation we mapped cax genetically by linkage analysis of the mutant phenotype with segregating chromosome markers. first, cax was assigned to chromosome  <dig> in an interval between the microsatellite markers d2mit <dig> and d2mit <dig> by analysis of  <dig> mutant f <dig> offspring from an intercross of  f <dig> hybrids. a fine genetic map was established by analysis of  <dig> n <dig> mutant progeny from a backcross of f <dig> hybrids to cax/cax mutants. the locus order and inter-locus distances  for the candidate gene region deduced from our analysis is d2mit22--d2mit140--d2mit309----d2mit286--d2mit262--d2mit <dig> . analysis of the mouse genome sequence showed that d2mit <dig> , which did not recombine with cax, resides approximately  <dig> kb downstream of the pofut <dig> gene . pofut <dig> appeared as an appealing candidate since o-fucose modification of notch is essential for receptor function  <cit> , and notch signalling is required for normal somite formation and patterning  <cit> . to directly test whether cax affects pofut <dig> we crossed homozygous cax mutants with heterozygous mice carrying a targeted null allele of pofut <dig>  pofut1tm1pst <cit> . mice carrying one copy of the cax mutation and one pofut1tm1pst allele had a significantly shortened body axis and axial skeleton defects , indicating that the recessive pofut <dig> null allele does not complement the cax mutation and identifying cax as a novel allele of pofut <dig>  which we refer to as pofut1cax from hereon.

to address whether the pofut1cax mutation affects the pofut <dig> coding sequence, we amplified pofut <dig> cdna from mrna purified from homozygous pofut1cax kidney and c3h wild type mice, and sequenced at least two independently generated cdna clones. no mutation in the coding sequence was detected , suggesting that pofut1cax affects pofut <dig> transcription. consistent with this idea, a probe from the coding region revealed by in situ hybridization overall reduced levels of pofut <dig> transcripts in a considerable portion of homozygous pofut1cax mutant embryos  that are also apparent in the psm and developing somites .

identification of the pofut1cax mutation
to identify potential structural alterations at the pofut <dig> locus that might cause the mutant phenotype we scanned  <dig> kb upstream of the atg as well as the whole intragenic region of the pofut1cax allele by pcr. primers were designed to amplify overlapping dna fragments between approximately  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length, and genomic dnas prepared from two wild type c3h and two mutant pofut1cax/cax mice were used as templates. with the exception of one primer pair that consistently failed to amplify a fragment of the 3' end of intron  <dig> from mutant dna  all pcr reactions amplified fragments of indistinguishable size from wild type and mutant dna. this suggested that the pofut1cax mutation disrupts the integrity of the pofut <dig> locus in this region. consistent with this idea, southern blot analyses using a cdna probe that contained exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and the 5' portion of exon  <dig> revealed restriction fragment length polymorphisms between wild type and mutant genomic dna .

the primers used to amplify fragment 4/ <dig> are located in fragments 4/ <dig> and fragment e <dig>  and should therefore be present in mutant dna . thus, we reasoned that an insertion into fragment 4/ <dig> might prevent amplification of this fragment from mutant dna by conventional pcr. therefore, we employed long range pcr with fragment 4/ <dig> primers, and amplified an approximately  <dig> kb fragment from mutant dna . sequencing of this fragment identified an intracisternal a particle  insertion into pofut1cax intron  <dig> . the presence of the insertion in the pofut1cax genomic dna was independently verified by pcr reactions that specifically amplify the junction fragments . in e <dig>  cax mutant embryos  pofut <dig> mrna levels were reduced to approximately 25% of wild type  levels  as determined by taqman real time pcr. western blot analyses with anti-pofut <dig> antibodies  <cit>  showed also reduced pofut <dig> protein levels in cell lysates from pofut1cax embryos . the protein reduction could not precisely be determined due to the normally low levels of endogenous pofut <dig> in embryos and additional background bands. thus, the pofut1cax allele carries an insertion of a retrotransposon that most likely underlies variably reduced pofut <dig> mrna and pofut <dig> protein levels. this variable reduction might also explain the variable phenotype of cax mutant embryos and mice.

effects of the pofut1cax mutation on notch dependent processes
to analyze in more detail how the cax allele affects notch activity and notch-dependent processes we first analyzed expression of the notch target genes hes <dig>  hey <dig>  and heyl, which are severely down-regulated in pofut1tm1pst/tm1pstembryos . in cax mutant embryos expression of hes <dig>  hey <dig>  and heyl was also obviously affected in the paraxial mesoderm and somites . in contrast, expression in other domains, for example of hes <dig> in the optic vesicle , and of hey <dig> and heyl in the branchial bars , was similar to wild type both with respect to expression levels and patterns. in the case of hes <dig>  the clearly visible stripes of expression in posterior somite compartments in wild type embryos  were not detected in cax mutants ). similarly, the strong distinct expression domains of hey <dig> in posterior somite halves of wild type embryos  appeared fuzzy in cax mutants , and expression in the psm was reduced . in mutant embryos  heyl expression was reduced in the anterior psm  and in newly formed somites, and expressed in a smaller expression domain in anterior somites . the expression patterns of hes <dig>  hey <dig>  and heyl in the paraxial mesoderm of embryos heteroallelic for the targeted null and the cax allele of pofut <dig> were more severely disrupted , consistent with expected further reduced pofut <dig> levels. in these embryos hes <dig> expression in the optic vesicle  was not obviously affected, whereas hey <dig>  and heyl  expression in the branchial bars appeared reduced, indicating that further reduction of pofut <dig> levels in pofut1cax/tm1pst embryos affects notch activity also outside the paraxial mesoderm.

consistent with obvious alterations of hes <dig>  hey <dig>  and heyl expression in the paraxial mesoderm also the expression patterns of genes that are important or indicative for somite patterning and polarity, and whose normal expression patterns depend on notch activity, were altered in pofut <dig> mutants. dll <dig> expression was virtually abolished in the somites but upregulated in the neural tube of pofut <dig> null mutant embryos . similarly, uncx <dig> , which is normally expressed in a regular pattern delineating posterior somite halves , was severely downregulated in somites of pofut <dig> null mutants , and expression of tbx <dig>  which normally delineates anterior somite halves , was expanded throughout somites  indicating loss of somite polarity.

in cax mutants anterior-posterior somite patterning was also abnormal, as indicated by the reduced and broadened dll <dig> expression domains in somites , fuzzy expression domains and disorganized stripes of expression of tbx <dig>  and uncx <dig>  . in heteroallelic pofut1cax/tm1pst embryos anterior-posterior somite patterning was more severely affected than in pofut1cax/caxembryos: the somitic dll <dig> stripes were essentially lost , tbx <dig> expression domains were fuzzy and expanded  and, uncx <dig>  stripes were irregular and scrambled . similarly, expression of cer <dig>  mesp <dig>  and papc was disrupted by the cax mutation further supporting the notion that somite compartmentalization is affected. cer <dig>  whose expression is normally restricted to the anterior somite compartments of the prospective and most recently formed two somites , was expressed in one broad domain  similar to pofut <dig> null mutants . mesp <dig> which is normally expressed in one or two distinct stripes of variable width  showed always only one not clearly delineated expression domain in cax mutant embryos , and the distinct domains of papc expression  appeared as one blurred domain in cax . in heteroallelic pofut1cax/tm1pst embryos , the expression patterns of these genes were similarly disrupted . in pofut <dig> null mutants  expression of these genes was severely downregulated in addition to their abnormal patterns .

since the establishment of somite polarity depends on the function of cyclic notch pathway genes in the psm  <cit>  we analyzed the expression of hes <dig> and lfng in cax mutant embryos. hes <dig> could be assigned to the three described phases both in wild type and cax mutant  embryos albeit expression in cax mutants was only detected after prolonged staining suggesting that levels are reduced . likewise, lfng expression patterns reflecting the different phases were found in cax mutants . in contrast, in additional  <dig> embryos we observed rather broad domains of expression in the psm  that could not be assigned to certain phases, suggesting that reduced pofut <dig> levels in cax mutant embryos impinge on the dynamic expression of cyclic notch target genes in particular on lfng. collectively, these data suggest that the reduced pofut <dig> mrna levels in cax mutant embryos attenuate notch activity below a threshold required for patterning the presomitic mesoderm, leading to defects in regular somite spacing and compartmentalization that underlie the observed skeletal malformations.

to address whether also other early processes regulated by notch are affected by the cax mutation we first analyzed establishment of left-right asymmetry, the earliest reported developmental process requiring notch activity in mice  <cit> . loss of pofut <dig> activity appears to completely block all early notch signalling  <cit> . however, thus far a requirement for pofut <dig> during establishment of left-right asymmetry has not been evaluated. consistent with an absolute requirement of pofut <dig> for notch activity, pofut1tm1pst/tm1pst embryos  showed defects in establishment of left-right asymmetry as indicated by the loss of nodal expression , which is directly regulated by notch signalling  <cit> . in contrast, none out of  <dig> pofut1cax/cax embryos showed abnormal nodal expression , and  <dig> analyzed heteroallelic pofut1tm1pst/cax embryos at e <dig>  had normal turning and heart looping , suggesting that pofut <dig> activity derived from one hypomorphic allele modifies notch signalling to a level sufficient for this process. vascular remodelling is another early process that critically depends on notch signalling  <cit>  and pofut1tm1pst/tm1pst embryos  show severe vascular malformations  <cit> . pecam <dig> staining showed a highly irregular vascular network in pofut <dig> null mutant embryos in all regions of the body . in contrast, pofut1cax/cax embryos had a vascular network that was virtually identical to wild type embryos , except for occasional minor irregularities of the intersomitic vessels, which most likely arise secondarily to somite patterning defects. in addition, overall neuronal differentiation assessed by expression of neurofilament  as a pan-neuronal marker was not obviously affected by reduced pofut <dig> expression  except for irregular spacing and width of spinal nerves , which also are most likely secondary to and indicative of disrupted somite patterning. likewise, expression of neurod and neurogenin <dig> was apparently unaltered in cax mutants  whereas both genes were clearly upregulated in pofut <dig> null mutants  indicative of enhanced neuronal differentiation due to loss of notch activity. thus, establishment of left-right asymmetry, angiogenesis and neuronal differentiation proceed apparently normal in cax mutant embryos whereas lfng expression appeared abnormal in most mutants and anterior-posterior somite patterning was consistently affected.

discussion
we have identified a novel allele, pofut1cax, of the mouse pofut <dig> gene that leads to reduced pofut <dig> mrna and protein levels. reduction of pofut <dig> in embryos homozygous for this allele consistently affects anterior-posterior somite patterning, which at least in part is due to abnormal lfng expression in the anterior psm, but apparently has no impact on other early developmental processes outside the paraxial mesoderm known to be dependent on notch signalling. our data suggest that notch signalling in distinct developmental contexts is differentially sensitive to the levels of pofut <dig> and/or pofut1-dependent modifications.

the complementation test in conjunction with the map position of pofut1cax and the intermediate phenotype of pofuttm1pst/pofut1cax heteroallelic embryos demonstrated that cax is an allele of pofut <dig> and that the cax mutation leads to reduced pofut <dig> function. since the coding sequence of pofut <dig> is not altered in the pofut1cax allele, the enzymatic properties of pofut <dig> are not affected. however, we observed a significant variable reduction of pofut <dig> mrna and protein, which provides a plausible explanation for reduced pofut <dig> activity. most likely the iap insertion that occurred close to the 3' end of intron  <dig> is responsible for reduced pofut <dig> mrna either by interfering with transcription or by destabilizing the message. insertional mutagenesis by iaps is not uncommon  <cit> , and other insertions into introns that cause mutations have been reported  <cit> . the c3h/he inbred strain of mice appears to have a particularly high frequency of iap insertional mutations  <cit> .

whereas loss of pofut1-mediated notch modification appears to block all notch activity , reduced pofut <dig> levels in embryos homozygous for the pofut1cax allele affects predominantly and consistently anterior-posterior somite patterning. disruption of normal cyclic lfng expression in the psm likely contributes to these abnormalities since overexpression or interfering with the cyclic expression of lfng was shown to cause somite compartmentalization defects similar to the loss of lfng function  <cit> . one potential explanation for the apparent high sensitivity of notch signalling during somitogenesis to pofut <dig> levels could be that normal pofut <dig> mrna levels are particularly low in the presomitic mesoderm , where notch signalling is critical for somite patterning, and pofut <dig> levels in mutants fall only in the psm below a critical threshold. however, substantial differences in expression levels in different tissues were not apparent in wild type embryos at e <dig>  , a stage at which cax mutants showed already substantial defects in their somites. however, we cannot exclude that such differences may exist but were not detected by the limited quantitative resolution of in situ hybridization.

in drosophila, the pofut <dig> protein appears to be required for efficient presentation of notch at the cell surface  <cit>  and/or for the constitutive trafficking of the notch receptor to early endosomes and downregulation of signalling  <cit> . it has been proposed that pofut <dig> also acts in the mouse psm as a chaperone that is essential for notch <dig> presentation at the cell surface  <cit> , whereas in cho and es cells pofut <dig> was not required for stable surface expression but for ligand binding and notch activation  <cit> . if pofut <dig> is required for notch presentation at the cell surface in the psm reduced pofut <dig> levels might cause reduced notch levels at the cell surface, which in turn could lead to attenuated notch activity. if that were indeed the case one would have to assume that notch trafficking in the psm is particularly sensitive to pofut <dig> protein levels, for which there is no experimental evidence at present.

alternatively, different fucosylation sites may require different levels of pofut <dig> activity for efficient modification, and reduced pofut <dig> levels might affect some sites more than others. since conserved o-fucosylation sites may have distinct functions with respect to notch activation and/or trafficking  <cit> , differential o-fucosylation may result in context-dependent effects. such effects have indeed been observed for the notch <dig> receptor in mice, where mutation of the o-fucosylation site in egf repeat  <dig>  which is essential for ligand binding, results in a hypomorphic allele which is compatible with apparently normal embryonic development but affects post-natal growth and t-cell development  <cit> . context dependent effects might also depend on the role of o-linked fucose residues as substrates for further modifications by fng glycosyltransferases. in mice, there are three fringe proteins, lfng, rfng and mfng, which are expressed in distinct patterns during development  <cit> . loss of rfng has no obvious consequences  <cit> , no in vivo data on the function of mfng have been reported, and loss of lfng leads to severe anterior-posterior somite patterning defects  <cit>  suggesting that fng modification of notch is of particular importance for somite patterning. since fringe proteins modify different regions of notch in vitro  <cit> , and not all o-fucosylated egf repeats are substrates for fringe activity  <cit> , reduced o-fucosylation might preferentially affect sites that are substrates for lfng and thus important for somitogenesis.

our findings and conclusions conflict with previous findings suggesting that somite segmentation is less sensitive to reduced notch activity than neural tissue  <cit> . in these experiments, a notch allele was used that gives rise to a processing-defective notch protein. this mutant notch protein can be processed to nicd by an unidentified protease more effectively than wild type notch, and it was suggested that this protease is more active in the paraxial mesoderm  <cit> . thus, processing-defective notch could generate more residual notch activity in the psm than in neural tissue providing the basis for the mild somite defects observed by huppert at al.  <cit> . in addition, segment border formation was used as the major criterion, but anterior-posterior patterning was in general more affected than segmentation  in their studies. since notch activity is not essential for border formation, but pivotal for anterior-posterior somite patterning  <cit> , the results of huppert et al.  <cit>  could also be interpreted in favour of a high sensitivity of somite compartmentalization to reduced notch activity and pofut <dig> levels that we observed in cax mutant embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
reduction of pofut <dig> expression to approximately 25% affects expression of notch target genes and notch-dependent processes differently in different tissues. cyclic lfng expression and anterior-posterior somite patterning is highly sensitive to the level of pofut <dig> in early mammalian embryos whereas other early notch-dependent processes apparently are not. reduced pofut <dig> levels might affect trafficking and/or o-fucosylation of notch as well as its further modification by lfng due to abnormal lfng expression. since fng modification of notch appears to be of particular importance for somite patterning, and not all o-fucosylated egf repeats are substrates for fringe activity, we propose that reduced o-fucosylation might preferentially affect sites that are substrates for lfng and thus important for somitogenesis. the hypomorphic pofut1cax allele should facilitate to further dissect the roles of pofut <dig> for notch signalling in different developmental contexts and at later stages of development.
