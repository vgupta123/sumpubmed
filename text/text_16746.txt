BACKGROUND
turkey, meleagris gallopavo , is second to chicken  as an agriculturally important avian species in the u.s. and globally  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses suggest that the last common ancestor to the turkey and chicken lived between  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . genetic analysis and the requisite tools for modern turkey breeding have hitherto focused on developing a genetic linkage map with limited physical information. turkey genome research has lagged behind and, to some extent, depended upon our understanding of the chicken genome. karyotype analysis demonstrated that the chromosomes of turkey are substantially similar to those of chicken . turkey has a diploid chromosome number of  <dig>  as opposed to  <dig> for chicken. most chicken chromosomes appear to correspond to single orthologous turkey chromosomes, except for gga <dig>  orthologous to mga <dig> and mga <dig>  and gga <dig>  orthologous to mga <dig> and mga <dig>  probably due to centric fission events in the turkey lineage  <cit> . the availability of the complete chicken genome sequence and its associated resources  <cit>  provided the opportunity to analyze the turkey genome and its evolutionary relatedness to that of the chicken in much greater depth.

an important step towards the comprehensive analysis of a large genome is the generation of high-quality, well-anchored physical maps  <cit> . such maps have been widely used to effectively integrate genomic tools for high-resolution genome mapping, marker-assisted breeding, positional cloning of genes, and quantitative trait locus  detection  <cit> . simultaneously, physical maps provide desirable platforms for whole genome sequencing and assembly  <cit>  and large-scale comparative genomics. various strategies for creating such maps have been employed, but the use of multiple independent data sources is desirable for cross-checking alignments and minimizing errors. bacterial artificial chromosome  fingerprints and bac-end sequences  together with genetic maps and cytogenetic analysis provide an efficient strategy for building robust whole-genome physical maps for large genomes. for example, gregory et al.  <cit>  produced a detailed comparative physical map of the mouse and human genomes by combining bac-end sequencing with a whole-genome bac contig map created using bac fingerprints, revealing a high level of local colinearity between these two genomes. fujiyama et al.  <cit>  constructed a clone-based comparative map of the human and chimpanzee genomes using paired chimpanzee bes aligned with the human genome sequence. larkin et al.  <cit>  built a cattle-human comparative map using cattle bes and the human genome sequence. roberto et al.  <cit>  reported a refined gibbon genome comparative map with respect to the human genome by combining bes and fluorescence in situ hybridization  analysis. wei et al.  <cit>  generated a sequence-ready physical map of maize and aligned it to the genome of rice, revealing its complex evolutionary history. gu et al.  <cit>  constructed a bac-based physical map of brachypodium distachyon and compared it with the rice and wheat genomes, providing an important resource for the completion of the brachypodium genome sequence and grass comparative genomics.

turkey has a genome size similar to that of the chicken at  <dig>  million base pairs  per haploid  genome  <cit> . to develop tools essential for continued genetic improvement of this species, dna marker-based genetic maps have been developed and aligned with those of the chicken  <cit> . recently, multi-platform next-generation whole genome shotgun sequencing of the domestic turkey has been carried out  <cit> , and that sequence was assembled, in part, using a preliminary version of the map that we describe below. however, further advances, such as the development of dna markers for fine mapping in a region of interest, isolation of clones containing a gene and/or qtl by positional cloning, finished quality whole genome sequence assembly, and large-scale comparative genomics analyses with other galliformes genomes, require the powerful infrastructure derived from a detailed physical comparative bac map.

here, we report a genome-wide bac-based physical and comparative map of the turkey genome, integrated using an average of one sequence-tagged site per  <dig> kilobase pairs . alignment of the turkey physical map with the chicken genome sequence identified  <dig> to  <dig> major chromosome rearrangement events that occurred during the separate evolution of the turkey and chicken genomes, most of which were shown to be inversions. these results suggest that genomes within the phasianidae have remained remarkably stable throughout their history and reveal interesting trends in the evolution of avian chromosomes.

RESULTS
turkey bac contig physical map
a total of  <dig>  clones were fingerprinted for physical map assembly, randomly selected from two large-insert turkey bac libraries, chori- <dig> and tknmi , the latter of which was generated in this study. these clones together cover the turkey haploid genome by about  <dig> -fold, with  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold coverage from chori- <dig> and tknmi, respectively . furthermore, we sequenced  <dig>  bac ends randomly selected from the two bac libraries and hybridized the libraries with over  <dig>  overgo probes designed from turkey bes, microsatellite markers and genes, chicken genes, and other regions of the chicken genome demonstrating high evolutionary conservation to facilitate map construction and comparative genomics.

genome coverage
we assembled the turkey physical map from bac fingerprints, bes and hybridization results independently using two approaches. in the first approach, contigs were assembled automatically using fingerprinted contigs  version  <dig>   <cit>  and then edited, verified and extended as follows. only those bacs with fingerprints of  <dig> or more bands were selected for contig construction. as a result, a total of  <dig>  bacs, covering the turkey haploid genome  <dig> -fold, were validated for map assembly. every fpc contig was manually checked for potential chimeric contigs based on bac fingerprint patterns. all questionable contigs were split and re-assembled at a higher stringency using cutoff values ranging from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig> . then, to identify potential junctions between contigs, the entire fingerprint database was searched for matches to terminal clone fingerprints of every contig using the end to end function of fpc with cutoff values ranging from 1e- <dig> to 1e- <dig>  contigs were merged only if terminal clones shared  <dig> or more bands and their overall fingerprint patterns supported the merge. next,  <dig>  dna markers assigned to  <dig>  bacs by overgo hybridization  were incorporated into the physical map contigs. contigs were merged using cutoff values between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> if they shared markers and their terminal overlapping band patterns supported the merge. then we incorporated  <dig>  bes including  <dig>  mate-pairs into the physical map. finally, without any further merges, singletons were added if there were overlaps with one or more clones in a contig using cutoff values between 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> 

the map assembly strategies described above reduced the total number of contigs in the turkey physical map to  <dig> from  <dig> , containing a total of  <dig>  clones, whereas the remaining  <dig>  clones remained as singletons. each contig contains  <dig> to  <dig> clones with an average of  <dig> clones per contig. the contigs span from  <dig> to  <dig>  kb, with an average physical length of  <dig>  kb . the  <dig> contigs consisted of  <dig>  consensus bands, estimated to span approximately  <dig>  mb. see additional file 1: table s <dig> for a list of the contigs of the turkey physical map. table  <dig> summarizes characteristics of the resultant turkey bac contig map. we aligned the physical map contigs to the chicken genome sequence . of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig>  spanning  <dig>  mb or  <dig> % of the total physical length of the turkey physical map could be aligned to the chicken genome sequence, based on the hybridization of  <dig>  unique probes to  <dig>  bacs and the blastn alignment of  <dig>  turkey bes as anchors.

the largest contig in the map consisted of  <dig> bac clones, spanning more than  <dig> mb in physical length. the average bac contig size of the map is >  <dig> mb with the n <dig> contig size being >  <dig>  mb. coverage by bacs assembled into the map was  <dig> -fold . according to our previous studies  <cit> , this coverage is expected to generate a high-quality physical map. moreover, since the source clones for the map were selected from two bac libraries constructed with different restriction enzymes , the resultant map is expected to have enhanced actual genome coverage  <cit> . the  <dig> contigs of the turkey physical map collectively span approximately  <dig>  mb in physical length, larger than the estimated  <dig> -mb turkey genome size by approximately 50%. the excess in total physical length is expected because fpc will not merge all truly overlapping contigs. these overlaps exist between contigs for which there are too few common restriction fragments to allow for a statistically significant merge, given the stringent criteria employed to minimize false positive overlaps.

bes-based turkey-chicken bac map
based on the high frequency at which turkey bes were uniquely aligned to the chicken sequence assembly  and the availability of extensive data from overgo hybridization , we also generated a turkey bac physical map using an alternative approach. contigs were first assembled by bes alignment to the chicken genome and then merged using terminal overgo hybridization to a common bac or common placement of terminal bacs in a single fingerprint contig. this approach provided a unique most likely orthologous alignment for  <dig>  turkey bacs along the framework chicken sequence . initial contigs were assembled from overlapping bac clones, each of which was placed by two consistent alignments , followed by merging the resultant contigs based on fingerprint contigs that were assembled independently of the bes data.

this second approach resulted in a comparative physical bac map between turkey and chicken, consisting of only  <dig> turkey contigs . the comparative map spans  <dig>  mb of the chicken sequence, with an average contig size of  <dig>  mb, a n <dig> contig size of  <dig>  mb and a n <dig> contig size of  <dig>  mb. all but four of the mapped turkey chromosomes were spanned on this map by three or fewer contigs, with  <dig> chromosomes spanned by a single contig and nine chromosomes spanned by two contigs. not surprisingly, the turkey z chromosome is less contiguous, consisting of  <dig> contigs, due to the fact that females  were used for both the turkey bac libraries and the chicken sequence assembly. the arrangement and number of contigs in our turkey z map did not change when we used the more complete chicken z sequence of bellott et al.  <cit>  rather than the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> assembly , although the sizes of contigs with internal repeats can change. our mga <dig>  mga <dig> and mga <dig> maps also are likely to be incomplete due to partial and/or uncertain coverage of the orthologous chromosomes  in the chicken sequence assembly  <cit> .

comparison of mapping approaches
the two bac contig map building approaches described above employed identical or overlapping data sets but differed in the order in which those data were used. the first approach built the initial physical map using fpc with bac fingerprints only, followed by incorporating dna overgo probe results  and bes alignments, whereas the second approach began by aligning turkey bacs into contigs along the chicken genome sequence based on consistent bes mate pair alignment or bes plus overgo hybridization alignment, followed by contig merging using fingerprint contig data and further hybridization or fish analysis. this approach took advantage of the expected high level of homology between the chicken and turkey genomes, as confirmed by the very high rate of matching turkey bes to unique orthologous sites in the chicken genome. given that the chicken sequence itself is estimated to be only about 95% complete  <cit> , it is remarkable that about 90% of the turkey bes mapped to it . with the rapid reduction in bes sequencing costs, the second approach is attractive in situations where a highly orthologous reference sequence already exists. it risks making false alignments between the test  and reference  genomes, but, in general, it more accurately aligns individual bacs within a given contig, is less sensitive to collapsing contigs due to repetitive fingerprints, and avoids false negative overlaps. when additional data  are employed to insure consistency, the likelihood of incorrectly aligning genomes  appears to be low. in our hands, the second approach decreased the contig number by about an order of magnitude . however, this gain in power is somewhat misleading, as in the second approach we performed several rounds of gap-targeted overgo hybridizations to merge contigs, whereas the first approach did not employ iterative gap-filling experiments. it is noteworthy that in our map we were able to place some turkey genome segments that are orthologous to unplaced chicken sequence contigs and to place turkey sequence orthologous to an unplaced chicken linkage group on mga <dig> . thus, our turkey-chicken comparative map provides information of value towards improving the current chicken sequence assembly.

chromosome evolution differentiating the turkey and chicken genomes
our comparative map predicts  <dig> to  <dig> major rearrangements  between the turkey and chicken genomes, mostly inversions . this result suggests a very high level of stability within phasianid genomes. the uncertainty in the number of predicted inversions derives in part from the fact that for two chromosomes  the maps are consistent with either two sequential inversions or simultaneous loss/inactivation of an internal centromere and gain/activation of a telomeric centromere. in addition, we were not able to completely resolve a complex alignment pattern of gga12p to mga <dig> that appears to involve at least one large segmental duplication  and uncertainty in the respective centromere locations, which may result from one to four inversions. below, the turkey-chicken chromosome alignment is described on a chromosome-by-chromosome basis.

mga1/gga1
despite being by far the longest chromosomes in turkey and chicken, mga <dig> and gga <dig> are almost completely co-linear. small differences are observed in the sema <dig> gene cluster , and in the epha gene cluster at around  <dig> mb  that may be due to errors in the chicken sequence, segmental duplication differences or possible unequal recombination. there is also a small segment of ribosomal rna-encoding dna  within the chicken sequence at  <dig> - <dig>  mb that is missing in turkey and seems likely to be an assembly error in chicken. small inversions  may also be assembly errors or true rearrangements. finally, there are two small segments of about  <dig> and  <dig> kb at  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb, respectively, on mga <dig> whose nearest homologues in chicken are on gga <dig> . it seems most likely that these do not represent true translocations but rather were paralogous duplications in the last common ancestor of chicken and turkey, of which chicken inherited one and turkey the other copy or segments that moved due to transposable elements. both gga <dig> segments contain fairly long cr <dig> retrotransposon sequences.

mga2/gga3
two inversions differentiate these orthologues. first, the entire gga3p arm is inverted, and there is also an inversion of the  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb segment . the p-arm inversion is supported by  <dig> bacs whose bes mate pairs span the rearrangement and  <dig> bacs that hybridize to both rtn <dig> and 105g04t, that flank the breakpoint in turkey, but are separated by  <dig>  mb on gga <dig> . the internal inversion is supported by  <dig> turkey bacs whose bes span the breakpoint and  <dig> bacs that hybridize to flanking markers in turkey that are separated by  <dig>  mb in chicken. both rearrangements were confirmed by fish mapping . the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> sequence assembly had previously located the gga <dig> centromere at  <dig>  mb, but zlotina et al.  <cit>  showed that this site is instead a cluster of repeats. thus, mga <dig> is spanned by a single contig with little or no observable p-arm.

mga3/gga2q
these two chromosomes differ by an inversion at the p terminus of mga <dig> . in addition, it appears the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> sequence may have misplaced short segments at  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb .

mga4/gga4q
other than the two small gga <dig> sequence segments found on mga <dig> as described above and an apparent small duplication of a segment at  <dig>  mb, these two chromosome arms are co-linear.

mga5/gga5
based on the genetic map, it appears that the p-arm of mga <dig> is inverted relative to gga <dig> . our data do not rule out the possibility that the centromere on mga <dig> also became telomeric as part of this inversion; however, the turkey karyotype  <cit>  clearly shows a visible p-arm on mga <dig>  there is also a small inversion of the p terminal  <dig>  mb of gga5p .

mga6/gga2p
some or all of the p terminal  <dig>  mb of gga2p appears to map internal to mga <dig> . while this might be due to a translocation, it seems more likely to be an assembly error due to a zinc finger gene family at around  <dig>  mb. otherwise, mga <dig> and gga2p are completely co-linear. note that technically, the sequence coordinates of mga <dig> should be reversed relative to those of gga2p since its centromere is now at the distal  end due to the centric fission that generated this chromosome  <cit> .

mga7/gga7
these orthologues appear to be co-linear except for another p-arm inversion that places the mga <dig> centromere near the p terminus . this result is unexpected since mga <dig> has a cytogenetically distinguishable p-arm  <cit> . it is possible that the mga <dig> centromere is located at the  <dig>  mb contig gap , although we did not observe multiple repetitive bes in this region as is usually the case adjacent to centromeres. another possibility is that the mga7p-arm is mainly repetitive dna not found in the gga sequence assembly or that one of the unassembled chicken microchromosomes is fused to the gga <dig> sequence to form mga7p. 

mga8/gga6
a complex series of rearranged segments are found at the centromeric termini of these two orthologues. most of these have been confirmed by fish hybridization . although it is impossible to discern the exact order of events without detailed mapping of other phasianid genomes, it is feasible to explain the various changes by a series of  <dig> consecutive inversions, each of which had different end points, leading to  <dig> genome segments whose orientations now differ between the two orthologues .

mga9/gga4p
these two orthologues appear to be completely co-linear. as with mga <dig>  the coordinates for mga <dig> should technically be reversed, as the centromere is presumed to remain at the distal  end due to the likely centric fission that generated this chromosome  <cit> .

mga10/gga8
the p-arm inversion that is the major distinguishing feature of these two orthologues was known from karyotype studies and confirmed by griffin et al.  <cit> . as we noted previously  <cit> , the end points of this inversion are consistent with it being due to unequal recombination between the two amylase gene paralogues described by benkel et al.  <cit> . there is also a ~ <dig>  mb segment  within this region that has inverted again such that its direction is now the same in both species. finally, we have placed orthologous sequence to that found in chr8_random in the chicken sequence assembly at the distal terminus of mga <dig>  presumably adjacent to the centromere on this telocentric chromosome .

mga11/gga9
these two telocentric orthologues differ only by an inversion at the centromeric end, about  <dig> mb in length .

mga12/gga10
these two orthologues are co-linear, but the mga <dig> centromere is now at the distal end, whereas it is about  <dig>  mb internal in gga <dig>  several turkey bes mate pairs span the location of the chicken centromere on gga <dig> . fish mapping  confirms the correct placement of the gga <dig> centromere in the sequence assembly but its absence at this site in mga <dig>  this could be due to two consecutive inversions or to centromere translocation, e.g., replacement of centromere function at the telomere and loss of the interstitial centromere.

mga13/gga11
the inversion of the gga <dig> p-arm leading to mga <dig> being telocentric  and its confirmation by fish have been described previously  <cit> .

mga14/gga12
as with mga8/gga <dig>  there is a complex set of rearrangements at or near the p terminus of this pair. this includes an apparent segmental duplication of a small region containing the rnf <dig> gene that appears in three separate locations in our map. the interstitial centromere in gga <dig> has moved closer to the chromosome terminus. fish resolution was not adequate to determine whether the mga <dig> centromere was terminal or between contig14- <dig> and 14- <dig> .

mga15/gga13
this pair is mostly co-linear except for a small  inversion near  <dig>  mb and a possible very small inversion or rearrangement near the centromere. the latter region is problematic in both our map and the chicken sequence due to being the site of the protocadherin gene cluster.

mga16/gga14
this pair contains a single internal inversion of about  <dig>  mb around  <dig>  mb that has been confirmed by fish mapping .

mga17-19/gga15-17
no rearrangements were detected between any of these three pairs of orthologues. however, both the sequence assembly and our map are incomplete for the very small, rdna-containing, mga <dig> and gga <dig>  see reed et al.  <cit>  for a more complete description of mga <dig> 

mga20/gga18
as described previously  <cit> , these two chromosomes are distinguished by a large inversion that terminates in oppositely transcribed nme gene paralogues, consistent with it being due to unequal recombination.

mga21- <dig>   <dig>  29/gga19- <dig>   <dig>  27
to the best of our resolution, these eight orthologous pairs are co-linear. as noted above, we find the telomeric ~ <dig>  mb assembled in wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> on gga2p to be located on mga <dig> . we also were able to position the segment assembled as gga22_random at ~ <dig>  mb on mga <dig>  finally, our map shows that the mga <dig> centromere cannot be at the orthologous location to that predicted for gga <dig> . it remains possible that the mga <dig> centromere is close to  <dig>  mb, the break between the two contigs in our map , but we did not observe the pattern of repetitive bes in this region that is typically found near centromeres. thus, it seems more likely that mga <dig> is telocentric .

mga27/gga <dig> and mga30/gga28
these two orthologous pairs cannot be accurately aligned, primarily because they are very poorly represented in bac libraries, as well as in sequence libraries. gordon et al.  <cit>  showed that the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> chicken sequence assembly was rather inaccurate for gga <dig>  and we believe the same to be true for gga <dig>  in general, our map of mga <dig> agrees with the gordon et al.  <cit>  gga <dig> sequence, although the map is complicated by an apparent duplication of at least one small segment. we were able to place the turkey orthologous sequence to gga28_random in our map of mga <dig>  and we also placed the orthologous turkey sequence to linkage group chre22c19w28_e50c <dig> within mga <dig>  it remains uncertain, but it seems likely that these two unplaced sequences are in similar, if not identical, locations in the chicken genome. the poor coverage of these two chromosome pairs and mga18/gga <dig> also applies to the remaining chicken and turkey microchromosomes and, for this reason, they are not assembled in the chicken sequence nor can they be assigned in our comparative map.

mgaz/ggaz
the birds used for both the chicken sequence and turkey libraries were female . therefore, the sex chromosome maps rely on half the coverage of that for autosomes. furthermore, bellott et al.  <cit>  showed that the ggazq terminus is rich in segmental duplications and poorly assembled in the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> chicken sequence, so this area is difficult to align in our map. the repeats at about  <dig> - <dig>  mb in wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> and about  <dig>  mb in bellott et al.  <cit>  are in a location consistent with the block of z heterochromatin present in the phasianidae but not other land fowl  <cit> . also, shang et al.  <cit>  showed that the centromere is incorrectly located in the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> ggaz assembly. our map agrees with their centromere location. the major difference between the two z chromosomes is a large  inversion on the second arm  extending from about  <dig> to  <dig> mb, using the wugsc <dig> /galgal <dig> coordinates. this has been confirmed by fish mapping . there is also a repetitive region near  <dig>  mb that is possibly mis-assembled or contains one or two very short inversions, as well as small segments from chrun_random and chrz_random in the sequence, and a segment  adjacent to the centromere that may be misplaced in the chicken sequence or may have moved in turkey.

mgaw/ggaw
due to its highly repetitive nature, the ggaw sequence is almost entirely unassembled, and no attempt was made to align it with mgaw.

integrating the bac map with the whole genome shotgun sequence
an earlier version  of our comparative turkey-chicken bac map provided a critical resource to aid in assembling the turkey genome sequence  <cit>  and aligning it on turkey autosomes . this is particularly important for the rapidly expanding set of genomes, like that of the turkey, that are shotgun sequenced solely by "next-generation" methodologies that tend to give shorter sequence contig and scaffold lengths. on the other hand, high quality bac physical/comparative maps provide an even more critical tool for those genome sequences generated by bac sequencing of minimal tile paths with either sanger-based or pooled next generation sequencing technologies  <cit> . while we did not use the turkey sequence assembly to improve the turkey bac contig map in order to avoid conclusions based on circular reasoning, there are a small number of the remaining contig gaps that could now be merged based on turkey sequence scaffold or contig data . such gaps most likely derive from short regions where there was little or no bac coverage, despite the use of the two large-insert libraries. although genetic maps  <cit>  also provide long range data that were used to align the turkey sequence scaffolds along chromosomes, their resolution is limited by marker density and/or linkage disequilibrium, and, in our experience, they are less accurate than a comparative map based on dense alignment of bacs using bes and/or overgo hybridization, along with bac fingerprint contigs.

CONCLUSIONS
the turkey-chicken bac map leads to several general conclusions. first, it confirms observations that avian genomes  show a very high level of stability  <cit> . despite as much as  <dig> million years of separate evolution since their last common ancestor, there may be as few as  <dig> and likely no more than  <dig> substantive  rearrangements separating the two genomes , not including those microchromosomes and the w chromosome that have yet to be accurately assembled in either species. second, those rearrangements that are observed appear to be almost totally due to intra-chromosomal inversions. although we observed a few instances of possible translocation events, based on their size, it appears that these are much more likely to be due to transposable element action, chicken sequence mis-assembly or duplicated sequences in the last common ancestral genome that were differentially inherited by chicken and turkey. we find no evidence in our map to support the two inter-chromosomal rearrangements proposed by aslam et al.  <cit>  based on turkey single nucleotide polymorphism  mapping nor can we confirm very many of their proposed  <dig> intra-chromosomal rearrangements, other than the inversions between mga10/gga <dig> and mga20/gga <dig> that we described previously  <cit> . although the reasons for this discrepancy are uncertain, examination of the rearranged snp loci suggests that several occur in duplicated sequences or within, or adjacent to, transposable elements. this would be consistent with movement of small sequence segments via transposition or differential inheritance of paralogous duplications that were present in the last common ancestral genome. although the reasons for the predominance of inversion events are uncertain, it is noteworthy that at least two appear to arise from unequal recombination between duplicated genes arranged in inverted order on the same chromosome . it therefore seems possible that some of the others are due to unequal recombination between cr <dig> elements or other repetitive sequences.

these results strongly support the surprising conclusion that there is a clear trend in turkey towards telocentric chromosomes, i.e., centromeres directly adjacent to the telomere. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and additional file 5: figure s <dig> show that interstitial centromeres of chicken chromosomes are located proximal to telomeres in their turkey orthologues for mga <dig>  mga <dig>  mga <dig>  mga <dig>  and mga <dig> and possibly in mga <dig> and mga <dig>  in addition, the two centric fission events involving gga <dig> and gga <dig>  <cit>  that produce mga <dig>  mga <dig>  mga <dig> and mga <dig> all result in telocentric turkey chromosomes. indeed, the only clearly metacentric chromosomes in turkey are mga <dig> and the sex chromosomes, mgaz and mgaw. mga <dig> may have a small p-arm, and mga <dig> clearly has a p-arm visible in the karyotype  <cit> . however, we were unable to map any sequence orthologous to the chicken genome to mga7p. the reason, if any, for this trend away from interstitial centromeres in turkey is unclear. based solely on karyotype data  <cit> , it would appear that a predominance of telocentric chromosomes is mostly a derived trait within turkey and closely-related pheasants, but cytogenetics alone cannot distinguish several of the rearrangements we have documented, so further comparative mapping would be required to clearly delineate this trend in phasianid evolution.

the comparative bac contig map, along with other genomic resources previously developed in the species, provides the foundation necessary for many areas of advanced genomics research in turkey, chicken and other galliformes species. for the turkey, as for other agricultural animal and crop species, a primary area of interest is trait  analysis based on linkage maps, increasingly derived using high density snp arrays. the bac-based physical map provides an essential resource for additional molecular analysis of trait loci and for positional cloning.
