BACKGROUND
the number of genomes being sequenced now exceeds  <dig>  of these, as of february  <dig>   <dig> are completed while  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bacterial, eukaryotic and archaeal genomes  are still underway  <cit> . much of this genomic sequence is relatively poorly annotated and one of the major challenges in bioinformatics is the computational annotation of this massive amount of data in a high-throughput manner  <cit> . genome annotation can be classified into three levels: the nucleotide, protein and process levels  <cit> . databases such as prosite  <cit> , prints  <cit> , smart  <cit> , tigrfams  <cit>  or pfam  <cit> , which keep information in the form of motifs, alignment blocks, or profiles, provide a reference for the annotation at the protein level  <cit>  where the main aim is to identify conserved regions and domains within the protein sequences predicted at the nucleotide annotation stage. interpro  <cit>  provides an integrated resource to cross-reference these motif or domain databases.

the pfam database, in particular, has a wealth of information about approximately  <dig> domains and plays a major role in achieving such high-throughput annotation of newly sequenced genomes, due to its specialized profile hidden markov models   <cit> . tigrfams is another similar database of protein families based on hmms designed to specifically support large sequencing projects, although this has less coverage with under  <dig> models in release  <dig> , and is focused more towards complete proteins than domains. profile hmms are flexible, probabilistic models that can be used to describe the consensus patterns shared by sets of homologous protein/domain sequences. they summarise the shared statistical features of these homologous sequences in a way that allows efficient searching for matches in translated dna sequences corresponding to predicted protein-coding genes. hmms in the pfam database are constructed from an alignment of a representative set of sequences for each protein domain, called a seed alignment. the seed alignments are tested and improved by manual curation, and by application to large databases like the universal protein  database  <cit> . a key issue, though, is the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of the representative seeds and the corresponding models. if the seeds get larger and increasingly general, then they may lose specificity.

it has previously been reported that more specific hmms, built from sequences obtained from a less diverged set of species, can lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in the detection of domains and will therefore provide improved coverage when annotating proteins in related species  <cit> . the hmm library tlfam-pro has been developed for use with prokaryotes and some results of using the method have been described  <cit> . about  <dig> clustalw alignments from ncbi's database of clusters of orthologous groups   <cit> , as of  <dig>  were used to compile hmms. it was found that, although tlfam-pro demonstrated higher scores and longer alignments, a search of the test dataset against pfam yielded more total hits, suggesting that tlfam-pro may provide a useful complementary resource to pfam. this preliminary study was carried out in  <dig>  when both the number of domains in pfam and the number of available genomes was much smaller than now and therefore it is unclear whether these results remain valid. it was also reported that archaeal- and fungal- specific tlfam databases had been constructed, or were to be constructed in the near future, but we are not aware of any publications describing them and no implementation is currently available. in other restricted applications, it has been shown that kingdom-specific hmms improve performance -, as shown for example, in the prediction of n-terminal myristoylation sites in plants  <cit> . however, as far as we are aware no large-scale study of the effectiveness of kingdom-specific hmms for protein domain searching has been carried out. given the rapidly increasing availability of un-annotated or partially annotated genomes across all kingdoms, it is important to determine whether more specific hmms are useful for the annotation of these genomes. in this paper, we test this hypothesis specifically, taking the case of fungal genomes as an example.

a large number of complete and partial genome sequences have recently become publicly available for fungal species. we are involved in the development of the e-fungi data warehouse, which provides tools for the comparative analysis of these genomes and associated functional data  <cit> . as part of this project we are developing a pipeline for the automated annotation of new genomes as they become available. we are therefore interested in developing methods for identifying protein domains and it is important to obtain the best coverage possible. in this paper we describe a fungal-specific hmm library that was developed to carry out this task. this serves as an example of a kingdom-specific hmm library, and we evaluate its performance in comparison to the more general pfam database  <cit> . we compile the fungal-specific hmms using genomic data from the  <dig> species represented in the current version of the e-fungi data warehouse  <cit> . we evaluate the increase in coverage provided by the fungal-specific models over those  <dig> species. in order to test the method on previously unseen data, we then evaluate its performance on five more recently sequenced genomes that were not included in the first release of the e-fungi database used to construct the models. our results demonstrate that a fungal-specific library does provide a significant increase in coverage and that best performance is achieved by combining results from the kingdom-specific hmm library with results from the standard pfam library. we investigate how this improved coverage affects the distribution of identified multi-domain proteins and we investigate the functional annotation of families that show the largest difference in performance between the two libraries.

RESULTS
comparison of fpfam and pfam results for sequences from  <dig> fungal genomes
for each of the original  <dig> genomes  we calculated the percentage of sequences containing at least one domain using the two hmm libraries . in this figure we only show result for the  <dig> domains represented in this version of fpfam, since we are interested in comparing the sensitivity of the fungal-specific models compared to the general models for the same domains in pfam. we found matches against these  <dig> domains, with  <dig> % average coverage of sequences in genomes by using pfam,  <dig> % by using fpfam, and  <dig> % by combining them. using fpfam,  <dig> genomes showed coverage of more than 70% of their sequences, while the other genomes had  <dig> – <dig> % of sequences covered. saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces kudriavzevii,saccharomyces castelli, candida glabrata, saccharomyces kluyveri, eremothecium gossypii, kluyveromyces waltii and schizosaccharomyces pombe achieved the highest coverage of above 75% of sequences. coverage of sequences with domains using pfam models is 2–13% lower than the coverage using fpfam models at the same e-value threshold. the combination of fpfam and pfam improved the overall average coverage further. in addition to  <dig> sequences commonly detected across all genomes,  <dig> sequences were picked up using fpfam that were missed by pfam, while only  <dig> found with pfam were missed by fpfam . these sequences could be added to the fpfam hmm seed alignments in order to improve coverage, but  both fpfam and pfam will be used for annotation and it is therefore not necessary for fpfam to reproduce all pfam hits.

fpfam and pfam results comparison for the test set of five fungal species
we have shown that the fungal-specific hmm library provides improved coverage over sequences within the original  <dig> genomes that were used to construct the library. principally, however, we are interested in whether fpfam will be useful for searching new genomes that contain sequences not used to construct the library. a comparison of fpfam and pfam results on the five new fungal genomes is shown in figure  <dig>  an average coverage of  <dig> % and  <dig> % was obtained using pfam and fpfam, respectively; while combining the methods gives an improved coverage of  <dig> %.

in addition to these results, pfam also picked up some more domains that are not yet included in the fpfam libraries. this suggests that a further improvement could be obtained in the annotation of novel genomes by applying both general and species-specific domain libraries.

examples of domain instances missed by pfam
the frequency or the number of domain instances recovered using pfam and fpfam can be divided into two categories; category a, where both models identify domains and category b, where only one of the two models produce hits. category a represents cases where both the libraries are broadly effective, while category b defines the libraries that are most effective in identifying additional domain instances. for clarity, the category b hits can further be divided into category bf  and category bp  hits. the number of domains and domain instances for category a, category bf and category bp in the training set of  <dig> and test set of five genomes are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  by looking at category bf and category bp, in addition to category a hits, this shows clearly that the performance of fpfam is much better than pfam, detecting both a higher number of domains and domain instances. this improved performance of the fpfam library is consistent across both the training and test set of genomes.

going further, we considered the licd family of proteins  which are involved in phosphorylcholine metabolism  <cit> . from the pfam database, available online  <cit> , there are currently no hits for this family of proteins in fungal species. however, in this study, the original pfam models and the fpfam models picked up  <dig> instances of category a hits. furthermore, there are  <dig> instances of category b hits, where  <dig> were picked up by fpfam alone  and  <dig> by pfam alone . further examples of novel domains from the top category b hits, where there was no fungal hit previously known in the pfam database, include the laminin-b  and fascin  domains. interestingly, it has previously been reported that standard pfam hmms are poor at distinguishing laminin domains compared to panther  <cit> . here, we note that the species-specific fpfam hmms can indeed detect these domains with good sensitivity in fungal species. another interesting example is ribosomal_s <dig> , a common and fundamental domain, currently assigned to  <dig> eukaryotic species by pfam, only one of which is fungal. here, fpfam is able to recover  <dig> bf instances alone, no bp hits were observed, while  <dig> category a hits were found. this shows that the method is able to recover novel hits from both well-studied and rare domains, offering a similar sensitivity to alternative hmm building approaches  <cit>  and extending the depth of annotation above that of the standard pfam approach. more examples are shown in table  <dig>  where the top  <dig> domain families are sorted based on the fraction of category bf hits compared to the bp and category a hits. there are about  <dig> domain families where the contribution of category bf hits is at least 10% of the total, and this coverage goes up to at least 50% among  <dig> different families. it is due to these category b hits appearing in both columns  that a combination of fpfam and pfam results provides better coverage than either library by itself. the complete table for these results is shown in additional file  <dig> 

domains per sequence analysis
to look at the coverage of domains in fungal sequences in a different way, the number of domains per sequence is presented in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  averaged over the  <dig> original and five new fungal genomes, respectively. fpfam obtains less single-domain proteins and more multiple domain proteins than pfam. it is clear from these figures that fpfam not only finds more proteins containing at least one domain but also unveils more domains per sequence.

comparison of bit-scores from pfam and fpfam model searches
in all of the analyses presented in this study we used the e-value as the only criterion to discriminate between true and false positives. by calibrating each library in the same way, these e-values should provide a similar false positive rate for each library and therefore make the results for each library comparable. however, it is also interesting to compare the distribution of bitscores on which these e-values are based, in order to identify any large differences between the corresponding models from each library. the bitscore is a normalized alignment score taking into account the underlying hmm scoring scheme, which is the same  for both models. to assess which of the two libraries produce a higher bitscore, histograms were constructed for the observed frequency of category a cases where bitscores for pfam are higher than fpfam and vice versa  and for the frequency of category b cases where either pfam or fpfam results were available . the bitscores were placed in six bins of bitscore ranges. only the maximum score from a pair was used to assign a hit to a bin when scores were available from both pfam and fpfam, so each hit is counted only once. the histogram of frequencies for different ranges of bitscores from  <dig> fungal genomes is shown in figure  <dig> and for five test genomes in figure  <dig>  from both figures, it can be observed that for the higher bitscore ranges  there are a larger number of cases where fpfam scores are greater than pfam scores , while in the intermediate range  we see that although category a hits have larger pfam scores on average, the number of cases found by fpfam-alone is greatest in this range. in the lowest range  we observe that for category a hits fpfam also typically has higher bitscores. however, in this range we also see a relatively large number of cases found by fpfam-alone in comparison to pfam-alone.

effect of e-value cut-offs on sequence coverage
to avoid any potential bias in the results due to selecting a single e-value cut-off to define hits, we reanalyzed the hmmpfam results using three different cut-offs, 1e- <dig>  1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the difference in results using the pfam or fpfam libraries alone is most pronounced for the  <dig> fungal genomes that were used to train the fpfam library; while, for the five new genomes this difference is not as high . however, for the five test genomes if we look at the combination results they give , i.e. significantly better coverage than using pfam alone. this confirms that our fungal-specific hmm library produces many additional hits and suggests that the combination of the general pfam library and a kingdom-specific library improves coverage, regardless of the e-value search sensitivity selected by the user.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a fungal-specific hmm library, fpfam, using sequences from  <dig> genomes and tested its performance against sequences from five new genomes. our results show that fpfam provides improved sensitivity and coverage for domains represented in the library. by using fpfam, more sequences can be annotated as containing at least one of these domains and more multi-domain proteins are found at a given e-value cut-off. the best performance is obtained by combining fpfam with the general-purpose pfam library, which finds some sequences missed by fpfam and allows additional domains to be located that are not represented in the current version of the fpfam library. use of a kingdom-specific hmm library therefore effectively reduces the "twilight" zone and finds a significant number of difficult cases that might otherwise be missed. indeed, the method demonstrates the ability to annotate additional examples of otherwise well-characterised, ubiquitous domains that pfam and fungal-specific, rare motifs that are generally not well represented in the standard pfam hmm library.

currently we are applying the domainer/mkdom algorithms  <cit>  for all predicted proteins from the  <dig> fungal species, in order to have a database like pfam-b providing coverage for all protein sequences in our e-fungi fungal database. the fpfam libraries will then be used in order to classify all fungal sequences into super-families, families and subfamilies in a hierarchical fashion. the fpfam families will be made available as full alignments of these domains.
