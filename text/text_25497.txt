BACKGROUND
amycolatopsis orientalis is a gram-positive filamentous actinomycete that produces vancomycin , which is a potent glycopeptide antibiotic that has been used for more than three decades for the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  infections  <cit> . however, the reports of increased emergence of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus  and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  in recent years have presented an urgent challenge to human health, which requires the development of new antibiotics against these pathogens . although some semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide antibiotics, such as telavancin, oritavancin and dalbavancin have been developed recently and their anti-vrsa activities proved in vitro <cit> , the in vivo potency of these antibiotics is yet to be demonstrated specifically by clinical studies. thus, further discovery and development of new glycopeptide type drug candidates continues to be an important mission for biologists and organic chemists.figure  <dig>

the gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of chloroeremomycin  in a. orientalis a <dig> and balhimycin  in amycolatopsis balhimycina dsm  <dig>  both of which possess an identical heptapeptide backbone and similar antibiotic activities compared with vancomycin, were completely  or partially  sequenced and annotated about 10 years ago  <cit> . thereafter, a series of genes from the two clusters, especially those encoding the post-assembly tailoring enzymes involved in chlorination  <cit> , glycosylation , and methylation  <cit> , were characterized sequentially. for example, the crystal structures of the tdp-epi-vancosaminyltransferase, gtfa  <cit> ; the udp-glucosyltransferase, gtfb  <cit> ; and the glycopeptide n-methyltransferase, mtfa  <cit>  from a. orientalis a <dig> were resolved. the methylation function of mtfa from a. orientalis a <dig> in the synthesis of glycopeptide antibiotics was studied in streptomyces toyocaensis <cit> , and the halogenase activity of bhaa from a. balhimycina dsm  <dig> was verified in vivo <cit> . of the enzymes encoded by the biosynthetic gene cluster of vancomycin  in a. orientalis atcc  <dig>  in vitro experiments demonstrated that gtfe is responsible for the addition of d-glucose to the hydroxyl of 4-hydroxyphenylglycine and that gtfd can transfer the l-vancosamine moiety to variant glucosyl-peptides as its substrates  <cit> . in fact, as early as  <dig>  the a. orientalis gtfe was expressed in s. toyocaensis, and a hybrid glycopeptide antibiotic, namely glucosyl a <dig>  was produced  <cit> . however, unlike a. balhimycina, a. orientalis is not amenable for genetic manipulations because of difficulties encountered in dna transformation  <cit> . therefore, most genes of the vcm cluster have been characterized by heterologous expression or in vitro enzymatic/structural analysis  <cit> , with little in vivo data reported.

to date, the dna sequences, along with their annotation information, have been provided for vcm cluster genes including those encoding the monooxygenases , the halogenase , the glycosyltransferases  and the vancomycin-resistance proteins . of these, the functions of the monooxygenase , glycosyltransferases , and the vancomycin-resistance proteins  have been well characterized. we cloned and sequenced the whole vcm gene cluster in  <dig> . however, with the exception of the glycosyltransferases and their encoding genes  <cit> , other post-assembly tailoring enzymes encoded in the vcm cluster, such as the halogenase and the methyltransferase, have been barely experimentally characterized so far and their functions are only assumed based on the similarity of the proteins to those encoded by bal or cep <cit> .

the complete genome sequences of the rifamycin producers amycolatopsis mediterranei <cit>  not only revealed the special genomic features of the genus amycolatopsis, but also confirmed it as a clade of rare actinomycetes potentially rich in antibiotic production capabilities. however, although three draft datasets for the genomes of a. orientalis subsp. orientalis were released recently  <cit> , neither the annotation nor genomic analysis for these glycopeptide antibiotic-producing amycolatopsis strains is available to date, particularly, at the level of the complete genome sequence. here, we report the whole genome sequence of an industrial strain  of a. orientalis . this strain produces high yields of vancomycin, and is derived from the species type strain atcc  <dig> through series of physical and chemical mutageneses. the high-quality complete genome sequence of a. orientalis was compared intra- and inter-generically to those of its close or distant phylogenetic relatives within the domain of actinomycetes to characterize species-specific and genus-common features of the genomes. moreover, functions of the predicted halogenase and methyltransferase of the vcm cluster in a. orientalis were characterized via robust spectroscopic analyses in the corresponding site-specific mutants, generated by a customized homologous recombination mutation method.

RESULTS
general and species-specific features of the complete a. orientalis genome
the genome of a. orientalis hccb <dig> comprises two replicons , a large circular chromosome  and a small, dissociated circular plasmid . the same circular chromosomal topology with that of a. mediterranei u <dig>  <cit>  and a. mediterranei s <dig>  <cit> , which are the other two complete genomes of the amycolatopsis genus currently available, implies that this is a common topological feature that differs from the streptomyces linear chromosomes  <cit> . the genome of a. orientalis hccb <dig> is much smaller  than that of a. mediterranei, and only  <dig>  protein-coding sequences  were predicted, which is approximately  <dig>  fewer cdss than those identified in the genome of a. mediterranei . the difference is mainly accounted for ~ <dig>  mbp shorter in the length of the non-core regions of a. orientalis. furthermore, this difference is also enhanced to a certain extent  by the smaller average size of the intergenic region  both in the core and the non-core regions of the a. orientalis genome , resulting in a more compact arrangement of genes  compared with that of a. mediterranei .figure  <dig>

initiated from oric, the dnaa gene was chosen as the starting point for the numbering of the total cdss in clockwise order . we assigned  <dig>  cdss  to known or putative functions, whereas the remaining  <dig>  cdss  were annotated as genes encoding hypothetical proteins . the dissociated plasmid  encodes  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> are functionally unknown. similar to a. mediterranei, the a. orientalis genome contains four rrna operons , and their 16s rna sequences are at the range of 97% identical . comparing the four rrna operons within the a. orientalis genome, the first two, counted clockwise from dnaa, are both transcribed in the forward direction and their 16s rrna sequences are slightly different . the second two are transcribed from the reverse strand and share identical sequences for their 16s rrnas . a. orientalis has  <dig> trna genes, which are largely similar to those of a. mediterranei, both in the chromosomal location and anticodon constitutions, with only a few exceptions, such as one less arginine and tyrosine trna genes and one more glutamic acid trna gene. it is worth emphasizing that, unlike a. mediterranei, no selenocysteine trna  was found in the a. orientalis genome. correspondingly, genes encoding selenocysteine synthase , elongation factor , and selenophosphate synthase  were not found in the a. orientalis chromosome. formate dehydrogenase, which has a selenocysteine -encoding uga codon found in the a. mediterranei genome, is also absent in a. orientalis. compared with a. mediterranei, a. orientalis demonstrates a clearer sporulation phenotype . although the genes responsible for this phenotypic difference are yet to be thoroughly defined, two genes, spsf  and spsg , encoding spore coat proteins, were identified only in the genome of a. orientalis. in contrast, the two pmea100-like integrated plasmids found in the a. mediterranei genomes are absent from the genome of a. orientalis, whereas the free plasmid pxl <dig> present in a. orientalis hccb <dig> is not found in any other sequenced amycolatopsis strains.

reciprocal blastp was used to calculate the orthologs between a. orientalis and other related actinomycetes . by employing a relatively strict condition , a. mediterranei  shares  <dig> % of the total cdss  as orthologs with a. orientalis, which is the highest among all of the comparisons of the selected actinomycetes. the genome of amycolatopsis sp. atcc  <dig> was recently sequenced by the doe joint genome institute   <cit> , and a high-quality draft with  <dig> contigs was released in genbank . we annotated it online using the fully automated service rast  <cit>  and found that, for the  <dig>  predicted cdss, amycolatopsis sp. atcc  <dig> shares  <dig>  orthologs  with a. orientalis  s. erythraea shared  <dig>  orthologs  with a. orientalis, which is the second highest number among sequenced actinomycetes other than that of amycolatopsis, coincides with the close phylogenetic relationship between the two genera . although s. viridis shares only  <dig>  orthologs with a. orientalis, with its small chromosome  encoding  <dig>  proteins, the genus saccharomonospora represented by s. viridis is still considered phylogenetically close to amycolatopsis, sharing an extremely high percentage  of orthologs, even higher than that between any two species of the same genus .

genome configuration and plasticity of a. orientalis compared with a. mediterranei
the unique chromosomal configuration consisting of core versus non-core regions characterized by the distinct features in gathering of essential genes  in the corresponding genomic regions was first recognized in the linear genome of s. coelicolor <cit>  and then in the circular chromosome of s. erythraea <cit> . recently, a novel “quasi-core” region, with typical core characteristics, was defined within the non-core region of the a. mediterranei u <dig> genome, along with the proposition of three discriminable criteria, including the gathering of essential genes, the discrepancy in coding density of orthologous genes and the co-linearity of the orthologs’ order  <cit> . in this study, taking the advantage of the availability of the complete genome sequences of two species  from the same genus, the chromosomal configuration of these species was analyzed using more rigorous statistical methods, and special genomic plasticity related to major antibiotics production was revealed as probable chromosomal recombination events.

first, a core region of a. orientalis genome  was recognized by its good co-linearity of the order of its orthologs, with  <dig> % of coding density for essential genes compared with  <dig> % in non-core regions . meanwhile, the coding density of orthologous genes in the core region  was also higher than that in the non-core regions   .figure  <dig>

.  all of the dots in the panels were calculated in a 90-kb sliding window. for the broken x plot , the dots represent a reciprocal best match between the genomes of a. orientalis and a. mediterranei, based on the blastp comparison. the x-axis  is the nucleotide scale of the a. orientalis  chromosome. r <dig>  and r <dig>  were designated as the two quasi-core regions in the a. orientalis genome. reciprocally, two regions  were defined as the quasi-core in the a. mediterranei genome. the core and quasi-core regions are highlighted in lavender  or in pink . p <dig> to p <dig> were designated as the regions containing biosynthesis clusters of rifamycin , vancomycin , nrps  and polyketide , respectively. in the upper right and lower left panels, the pink triangles represent the coding density of all of the genes; the turquoise squares represent the coding density of orthologs between the genomes of a. orientalis and a. mediterranei; and the yellow circles represent the coding density of the essential genes. the area within the black square frame is the p <dig> region containing the vcm cluster, with a lower coding density of orthologs and essential genes.  alignment of the p <dig> region with its flanking genes related to the vancomycin biosynthesis in selected actinomycete genomes. the green arrows represent the omitted genes in the corresponding genomes.  alignment of the p <dig> region with its flanking genes related to the rifamycin biosynthesis in selected actinomycete genomes. all of the genome data are available at ncbi.



second, different from the analysis between the genomes of a. mediterranei and s. erythraea, two quasi-core regions  within the non-core of the a. orientalis genomes are defined compared with that of a. mediterranei . the gene orders in these two regions show good conservation with those of a. mediterranei and the coding density of orthologous genes is  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, significantly higher than that of the non-core regions . in addition, the coding density of essential genes in these two regions is also higher than that in the non-core regions , reaching  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively . it is worth mentioning that the identification of two quasi-cores is reciprocal, i.e., two regions  can be defined as the quasi-cores in the a. mediterranei genome by comparison with the genome of a. orientalis , which was obviously unrecognized previously when the genomes of differently related species were compared  <cit> . in particular, we noticed that all of the four rrna operons of both species are located in either the core or quasi-core regions , as are  <dig> of the  <dig> trna genes of a. orientalis  containing the codons for all  <dig> essential amino acids .

comparing the genome of a. orientalis with that of a. mediterranei, a large inversion usually known as the “x pattern” was revealed. although the order of orthologs is well conserved between these two species, the line of the “x pattern” is not consecutive and is often interspersed with break points. most of the break points are within the non-core regions encoding the majority of the secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters , which might represent some horizontal gene transfer events. the rare break points embedded in the core regions, termed p <dig> to p <dig>  are usually the regions containing gene clusters for the synthesis of the “species-specific” secondary metabolites, i.e., rifamycin  in p <dig> of a. mediterranei and vancomycin  in p <dig> of a. orientalis . the p <dig> region in a. orientalis is nearly 300 kb in length. it not only contains the 64 kb vcm cluster, but also encodes many hypothetical proteins or predicted transcriptional regulators, and thus shows a relatively low coding density of orthologs and essential genes. in contrast, the corresponding region of a. mediterranei contains dozens of cdss , including two gene pairs of transposase/integrase . the amed_1452-amed_ <dig> gene pair is a duplicate of amed_1442-amed_ <dig> with a reversed transcription direction, which indicates that an insertion might have occurred in the p <dig> region of an ancestral strain, which resulted in the acquisition of the vcm gene cluster in a. orientalis. unlike the p <dig> flanking regions, the two regions flanking the rif cluster of p <dig> are highly conserved among the amycolatopsis species . as indicated by the alignments, the rif cluster appears to be inserted between two genes encoding a conserved hypothetical protein  and the unique dna-directed rna polymerase β subunit . therefore, we speculate that the ancestor of a. mediterranei may have acquired the rif cluster more recently than that occurred in p <dig>  in addition, a luxr-like transcriptional regulator  is located between the 3’ end of the rif cluster and the conserved rpob gene , which seems to have been acquired simultaneously with the rif cluster by the ancestral strain. a potential regulatory function of this luxr-like protein in rifamycin biosynthesis is inferred, and the corresponding experimental proof is currently being pursued .

in this study, intra-generic comparative genomic analysis of amycolatopsis not only confirmed the core/quasi-core and non-core genomic configuration, but also discovered certain genomic plasticity hot spots in this genus. it should be noted that the definition of core, quasi-core, or non-core regions of a genome so far remains a relative concept with respect to the genomes of certain species or genera to be compared. the choice of the sliding window size could also influence the characterization of the genomic configuration, which was clearly demonstrated in the case of comparing the coding density of essential genes between the quasi-core and non-core regions. when the window size used in the analysis was reduced from 90-kb to 45-kb, thus doubling the sample size, the p-values were reduced from more than one to ≤  <dig>  . in our opinion, these flexible categorizations are somewhat artificial; however, they are useful tools to infer different processes of evolution of a genus or of microevolution of a species. the quasi-core region may represent the residue of the complex evolution dynamics  of the ancestral genome, while the non-core regions may represent the chromosomal expansions  in the various descendants’ genomes. as more whole genome sequences of different strains of one species or different species of one genus, as well as those from closely related genera, are published, the biological implications of this genomic plasticity in bacterial phylogeny will be clarified.

development of molecular chemotaxonomic characteristics  for the genus of amycolatopsis
the taxonomic status of a. orientalis underwent the same revision history as that of a. mediterranei <cit> ; i.e., it was originally considered a streptomycete  <cit> , then transferred to nocardia <cit> , and finally classified as a species of the newly established genus amycolatopsis <cit> , which was typically defined by the biochemical characteristics of its cell wall  and cell membrane . as initiated in the study of the a. mediterranei u <dig> genome  <cit> , in addition to the molecular genetic basis responsible for the components of arabinose, glycine, diaminopimelic acids and mycolic acids , we attempted to analyze the previously unidentified genetic basis of two more chemotaxonomic phenotypes, i.e., phospholipids and menaquinones.

the cell membrane of actinomycetes is classified into five types according to the presence of certain nitrogenous phospholipids  <cit> . the amycolatopsis cell membrane belongs to the pii type because only one nitrogenous phospholipid, namely phosphatidyl ethanolamine , was usually detected in its cell membrane  <cit> . in prokaryotes, phosphatidylserine is first generated from cdp-diacylglycerol, a general intermediate for the synthesis of different types of phospholipids, catalyzed by phosphatidylserine synthase , and is then transformed into pe  <cit>  by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase  . orthologs of both pssa  and psd  could be identified in the a. orientalis genome. these two genes also exist in other actinomycetes with a type pii cell membrane, such as a. mediterranei, n. farcinica, s. coelicolor, and m. smegmatis, but are absent in actinomycetes with a type pi membrane  or other types of cell membranes. moreover, in the genomes of neither a. orientalis nor a. mediterranei did we identify genes encoding phosphatidylcholine synthase , which catalyzes the formation of phosphatidyl choline , the characteristic type piii phospholipid, or the genes encoding phosphatidylglycerophosphatase a , which catalyzes the formation of phosphatidyl glycerol , the characteristic type pv phospholipid . it is worth mentioning that the gene ept <dig>  which encodes ethanolamine phosphotransferase  that catalyzes the biosynthesis of pe from  <dig>  2-diacylglycerol and cdp-ethanolamine in eukaryotes, is also absent in any of the sequenced actinomycete genomes .figure  <dig> 
biosynthetic pathways of different types of nitrogenous phospholipids in actinomycetes.  the cell membrane of amycolatopsis belongs to the type pii because pe is the dominant phospholipid detected. two essential proteins  involved in the biosynthesis of pe were encoded by the a. orientalis genome, whereas the genes encoding enzymes involved in other types of nitrogenous phospholipids were not found . actinomycetes of type pi contain no nitrogenous phospholipids in their cell membrane, while type pii, type piii, type piv, and type pv actinomycetes contain the following characteristic phospholipids: pe, pc, glunu, and pg, respectively. panel  illustrates the analysis of isoprenyl diphosphate synthases from type strains of actinomycetes. the names and amino-acid sequences of the strains with different colors represent actinomycetes harboring different-length mks: red, mk <dig> ; olive-green, mk <dig> ; blue, mk <dig> . the amino-acid sequences of the chain-length determination  region are emphasized in green on the right of the panel. the protein sequences were obtained from ncbi at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/.



isoprenoid quinones comprise a hydrophilic head and an apolar isoprenoid side chain, functioning mainly as electron and proton carriers in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport systems  <cit> . these compounds have also been used as conventional biomarkers in bacterial chemotaxonomy since the 1960s  <cit> . in the synthesis of isoprenoid quinones, isoprenyl diphosphate synthase  catalyzes the consecutive condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate  with allylic diphosphates and produces a variety of prenyl diphosphates with different chain lengths  <cit> . previous studies reported that the specific amino-acid residues of isoprenyl diphosphate synthases attributable to the chain-length determination were designated the chain-length determination  region  <cit> . however, for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid quinones with longer chain lengths , the consensus cld region in isoprenyl diphosphate synthases has yet to be clarified  <cit> . in actinomycetes, menaquinone  is the characteristic type of isoprenoid quinone in the cell membrane. we compared the amino-acid sequences  of isp from type strains of actinomycetes harboring different-length mks but no regular patterns could be found . hence, the isoprenyl diphosphate synthases were analyzed phylogenetically using the neighbor joining  method. as shown in figure 4b, species with mk- <dig>  in their membranes are clustered within one clade, whereas species with mk- <dig>  or mk- <dig>  are clustered together and are indistinguishable in the tree. in addition, the maximum parsimony  method was also used to construct a phylogenetic tree. however, the clustering result could not distinguish the species harboring mk- <dig> or mk- <dig> either . therefore, it is yet to be experimentally clarified whether the genotypes of isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, i.e., their sequence specificities, are a sufficient determinant for all different side chain lengths of isoprenoid quinone, or whether the variation of isoprenoid quinones in actinomycetes is a quantitative, rather than a qualitative, property that might be determined by gene expression regulation or other post transcription/translational modifications.

in summary, our sequential studies in two species of amycolatopsis  indicate that the chemotaxonomic characteristics of this genus, which relate to, but differentiate from streptomyces and nocardia, are intrinsically determined by the molecular phylogeny of their encoding genes. on the other hand, the failure to precisely determine the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the chain-length of mk hinted at the complexity of these genotype/phenotype correlations. together with some more important chemotaxonomic characteristics, such as the composition of fatty acids, these complex phenotypes and their related molecular genetic mechanisms may prompt further biochemical and molecular biological studies. nowadays, we propose that, based on whole genome analysis of multiple bacterial strains belonging to and related with a taxon , potential molecular chemotaxonomic characteristics  could be developed as the genotypes underlie the biochemical characteristics  of the taxon. the implementation of mccs in bacterial systematics will not only alleviate the tedious workload of chemotaxonomic identification, but also improve our understanding of the genetics of bacterial metabolomes, which will form an indispensable portion of the modern prokaryotic taxonomy in the era of genomics  <cit> .

biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the post-assembly modifications of vancomycin in a. orientalis
twenty-six secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters were predicted in the complete genome of a. orientalis hccb <dig>  including nine type i polyketide synthase  clusters, one type ii pks cluster, ten non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  clusters, three hybrid pks-nrps clusters, two clusters for terpenoids, one cluster for lycopene , and one cluster for β-carotene  . the total length of these gene clusters was estimated ~552 kb, which is  <dig> % of the whole genome. in contrast to the essential genes, most of the secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters  were in the non-core regions .

to determine the possible phylogenetic relationships of the secondary metabolites biosynthesis gene clusters, all of the cdss for pkss, nrpss, or terpene synthases were compared against the ncbi database via blastp. the best hits information is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  twenty-seven genes in nine biosynthetic gene clusters  have orthologs in the a. mediterranei genome with the best hitting scores, i.e., car, pks <dig>  lyc, and tps <dig> in the core region and pks <dig>  tps <dig>  nrps <dig>  pks <dig>  and pks <dig> in the non-core regions. furthermore, the nrps <dig>  pks <dig>  and pks <dig> gene clusters are closely located in the non-core region, particularly the pks <dig> and pks <dig> clusters . these close correlations between sequence similarity and genomic loci gathering may indicate a common phylogenetic origin.

notably, among the eight gene clusters for secondary metabolism located in the core and quasi-core regions, except for four clusters  orthologous to those encoded in a. mediterranei genome, all of the other a. orientalis specific clusters  are located in the break point of the chromosomal “x pattern” blocks. however, because of the small coding size of nrps <dig> and nrps <dig>  only the vcm cluster , located in the p <dig> break point, and the pks <dig> cluster , located in the p <dig> break point, could be traced in the “x pattern” blocks . the ks domains of pks <dig> are similar to those of the salinosporamide a biosynthetic gene cluster in salinispora tropica cnb- <dig>   <cit> . this cluster is rich in genes encoding modification enzymes, such as glycosyltransferases, halogenase, and cytochrome p <dig>  which suggests the production of a glycosidic and halogenic compound.

in the non-core regions, cluster pks <dig>  contains a type i polyketide synthase, which was once reported to synthesize a glycosidic polyketide eco- <dig> that shows activities against mrsa and vre  <cit> . for the other secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in a. orientalis genome, their putative substrates or probable products were predicted using catalytic domain analysis against the sbspks  <cit>  or nrpsdb  <cit>  databases and the results are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  we isolated the total rna of a. orientalis from two different cultures , and used reverse-transcription pcr to detect the transcription profiles of the gene clusters that might synthesize potential secondary metabolites. as shown in the additional file 1: figure s <dig>  in both f <dig> and f <dig> media, the genes of three clusters  showed significant levels of transcription, with vcm being the highest among all gene clusters tested. another cluster  was expressed in the f <dig> fermentation medium but not in the f <dig> medium. although we failed to identify any novel secondary metabolites, our data provides a foundation for further exploration.

the vcm cluster was annotated to encode a total of  <dig> enzymes , including three vancomycin-resistance proteins , three large nrpss, several post-assembly tailoring enzymes, and a series of biosynthetic proteins for the supply of amino-acid precursors . different from the cep and bal clusters, in which three genes encoding glycosyltransferases were predicted  <cit> , only two glycosyltransferases are encoded in the vcm cluster . on the other hand, the vancomycin-resistance genes vanhax  are only predicted in vcm and not in the other two clusters . throughout the a. orientalis genome, we identified another vana  and vanx , as well as a two-component system  similar to the vansr of bal that may be related to the vancomycin resistance.table  <dig>

similar to the biosynthesis of balhimycin and chloroeremomycin, the biosynthesis of vancomycin includes three steps  <cit> . the related functional genes inside and outside of the vcm cluster were mapped to the a. orientalis genome . first, seven amino-acid precursors, including one leucine, one asparagine, two β-hydroxytyrosine , two 4-hydroxyphenylglycine  and one  <dig>  5-dihydroxyphenylglycine , need to be synthesized. genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of three non-protein amino acids were identified in the genome, i.e., aori_1492-aori_ <dig> for l-βht, aori_ <dig>  aori_ <dig>  aori_1495-aori_ <dig> for l-hpg, and aori_1502-aori_ <dig> for l-dpg.figure  <dig>

second, the seven precursor amino acids are assembled to form a heptapeptide backbone, which are catalyzed by the nrpss vcma , vcmb , and vcmc . these three giant enzymes contain seven modules  with  <dig> domains that function in the selection, activation, condensation and epimerization of the amino-acid substrates  <cit> . in m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  there are three epimerases  that convert l-βht <dig>  l-hpg <dig>  and l-hpg <dig> into the corresponding d type amino acids. the n-terminal amino acid of vancomycin is d-methylleucine  <cit> . however, neither an epimerase nor a dual condensation/epimerization domain  <cit>  was observed in m <dig> or the adjacent c domain in m <dig>  rausch et al. conjectured that a racemase outside the vcm cluster might be responsible for the conversion of l-leucine into d-leucine, which can be incorporated directly into the glycopeptides  <cit> . throughout the whole genome, there are  <dig> genes that potentially encode racemases, including six amino-acid racemases, three coa racemases, and two mandelate racemases . the recent genomic analysis of vibrio cholera identified a novel plp-dependent amino-acid racemase  that was proven to be necessary and sufficient for the synthesis of the unusual d-amino acids, including d-leucine  <cit> . with vc <dig> as the query sequence, we used the blastp program to search throughout the whole genome of a. orientalis. the results revealed one protein, annotated as an amino-acid racemase , which has 28% amino-acid identity  with vc <dig> and that may function in d-leucine conversion. further experimental proof is required to confirm its involvement in vancomycin synthesis.

the last step is the post-assembly modifications of the heptapeptide backbone, including its cyclization, halogenation, methylation and glycosylation. based on their corresponding genes in the cep and bal clusters  <cit> , the functions of the modification genes in the vcm cluster were annotated . the oxya/b/c  genes likely encode three p <dig> monooxygenases that are responsible for closing the linear peptide to form the heptapeptide ring  <cit> . adjacent to them, aori_ <dig>  is predicted to encode a halogenase, showing 94% amino-acid sequence identity with that encoded by the bhaa in bal <cit> , which chlorinates the βht residues. however, the exact timing of the chlorination is unknown, although it was proposed to occur before the oxidative couplings  <cit> . the methylation of d-leucine on the α-nh <dig> is catalyzed by a methyltransferase, which has been functionally characterized in the cep cluster  <cit> . its orthologous protein in the vcm cluster was found and annotated as vmt . glycosylation is the last of the modifications and the functional glycosyltransferases for vancomycin biosynthesis have been well-characterized biochemically  <cit> . gtfe  is responsible for the addition of the first tdp-glucose moiety to the 4'-hydroxyl group of amino acid hpg <dig>  and the other glycosyltransferase gtfd  adds the second tdp-l-β-vancosamine moiety to the 2'-hydroxyl group of a glucose residue. aori_ <dig> shows the highest amino acid sequence similarity to bgtfb encoded by bal  and gtfb encoded by cep , whereas aori_ <dig> shows the highest similarity to bgtfc encoded by bal  and gtfc encoded by cep . no glycosyltransferase corresponding to bgtfa or gtfa, which add 4-epivancosamine to the amino-acid residue of βht <dig> in bal or cep, was found in the genome of a. orientalis. therefore, there is no epi-vancosamine moiety present in vancomycin .

to characterize the in vivo functions of the predicted halogenase, the putative methyltransferase and the glycosyltransferases encoded by the vcm cluster, in-frame monogenic mutants of aori_ <dig> , aori_ <dig> , aori_ <dig> , and aori_ <dig>  are successfully constructed using a homologous recombination method similar to the pcr-targeting system . various types of vancomycin derivatives, i.e., dechlorovancomycin, demethylvancomycin, desvancosamine vancomycin, and aglucovancomycin, which accumulated in the corresponding mutant cultures, were collected and their structures were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  . based on the results from the zone of inhibition test, desvancosamine vancomycin , particularly dechlorovancomycin , showed a lower bioactivity relative to that of vancomycin, whereas aglucovancomycin  showed a slightly higher bioactivity than that of vancomycin. the bioactivity of demethylvancomycin  was comparable to that of vancomycin. in addition, using demethylvancomycin or aglucovancomycin as the substrate, dimethylvancomycin  or dimethylaglucovancomycin  were generated in vitro catalyzed by the heterogeneously expressed methyltransferase aori_ <dig>  their molecular weights were also confirmed by the hplc-ms spectrum, and the positions of the two methyl groups on the n terminus of leucine  were further examined using nuclear magnetic resonance  . compared with that of vancomycin , dimethylvancomycin showed a comparable antibacterial activity. although dimethylaglucovancomycin  is a novel compound, its activity was also similar to that of aglucovancomycin. taken together, both methylation and demethylation do not affect the in vitro antibacterial activity of vancomycin or its derivatives. for glycosylation, despite aglucovancomycin showing a slightly higher bioactivity than that of vancomycin in vitro, the in vivo activity was five-fold lower than that of vancomycin  <cit> , indicating that the sugar moiety may play an important role in imparting enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.figure  <dig>

cluster. the 64-kb vcm cluster is illustrated in detail. aori_ <dig> , aori_ <dig> , aori_ <dig> , and aori_ <dig>  were replaced in-frame by selection markers, and aori_ <dig> was overexpressed in vitro using demethylvancomycin/aglucovancomycin as the substrate. the vancomycin standards  and the corresponding variants obtained by isolation from mutant strains or the in vitro treatments were detected by hplc-ms:  dechlorovancomycin,  desvancosamine vancomycin,  aglucovancomycin,  dimethylaglucovancomycin,  demethylvancomycin, and  dimethylvancomycin. the structural formulae of the variants are shown in the table of figure  <dig>  a mass of  <dig> μg of each compound was used to assay its activity against mrsa, and the picture is representative of three independent experiments.



with the exception of dimethylaglucovancomycin, nearly all of the vancomycin derivatives mentioned above have been isolated naturally and their antibacterial activities reported  <cit>  and our results are in agreement with these previous findings. however, this study provides, for the first time, in vivo functional characterization of the predicted halogenase, the putative methyltransferase and the biochemically-characterized glycosyltransferases in a. orientalis, along with a systemic analysis of the distinct bioactivities of different vancomycin variants. these in vivo analyses not only demonstrated that the vcm encoded halogenase and methyltransferase are functionally equivalent to those encoded in the bal and cep clusters, but also inferred that the modifications of halogenation, methylation, and glycosylation are not conducted exactly in series  <cit> , because the vancomycin variants produced by each mutant were only deficient in their corresponding modification principally . in other words, the tailoring enzymes  are not very specific, but have broad substrate spectra in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of a. orientalis hccb <dig> is the first complete sequence for the bacteria that synthesize the vancomycin group antibiotics. compared with the phylogenetic closely related rifamycin-producing strain a. mediterranei, a. orientalis has a relatively smaller chromosome and a more compact genomic organization. their different configurations revealed possible chromosomal recombination events representing genomic plasticity related to either vancomycin biosynthesis or rifamycin biosynthesis. by comparison with other actinomycete genomes, the common features of the amycolatopsis genomes and molecular chemotaxonomic characteristics  representing the phenotypes of phospholipid and menaquinone for this genus were further identified and developed. in addition, the knockout of genes encoding the tailoring enzymes in a. orientalis was achieved, and the functions of the predicted halogenase and methyltransferase annotated in the vcm cluster were characterized for the first time. the data provided by this study may facilitate the development of novel lead compounds for drug development, either through a combinatorial biosynthesis approach employing enzymes with newly engineered modification activities, or using different vancomycin derivatives as the starting chemical moieties.
