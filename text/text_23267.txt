BACKGROUND
fetal mesenchymal stem/stromal cells  have properties intermediate between adult and embryonic stem cells, and thus considerable therapeutic potential. advantageous characteristics of fetal over adult msc include their higher proliferative rate, greater differentiation capacity and longer telomeres with reduced senescence  <cit> . indeed, a primary fetal bone marrow msc line from our team had the fastest migratory capacity of  <dig> cell lines assessed at a recent american society of cell biology   <cit> . successful translation of cell therapies requires an in-depth understanding not only of the basic stem cell properties of differentiation and self-renewal, but also of the cell type’s adhesive and migratory properties.

msc can be mobilized from their sedentary niches by a range of external stimuli and triggered to migrate to and occupy distant tissue sites  <cit> . preferential homing to sites of tissue injury has been demonstrated with both adult  <cit>  and fetal msc  <cit> . however poor understanding of the underlying processes in adult and particularly fetal msc limits our ability to exploit them for targeting msc to regions of tissue damage. improved homing would facilitate therapeutic development and reduce inappropriate uptake of msc in healthy tissues.

cxcr <dig> is a g-protein coupled receptor belonging to the cxc family of chemokine receptors. interaction of cxcr <dig> with its ligand, stromal derived factor  directs the movement of cells in hematopoietic stem cell homing  <cit> , leukocyte trafficking  <cit>  and tumour metastasis  <cit> . the cxcr4-sdf-1α axis is active in adult msc, which migrate toward sdf-1α in vitro <cit> . cxcr <dig> is expressed on the surface of only a subset of adult msc, but up-regulation by viral transduction increases msc homing  <cit> , rendering cxcr <dig> a target for modulating migration. however the viral approach is unsuitable for clinical translation due to the risk of insertional mutagenesis. cxcr <dig> expression is dynamically regulated by external cues like hypoxia  <cit> , and can be up-regulated in adult msc following in vitro priming with a mixture of cytokines, as shown to enhance migration in vitro toward an sdf-1α gradient as well as homing in vivo to bone marrow  <cit> . recently, sdf- <dig> exposure was shown to up regulate low basal cxcr <dig> surface expression in fetal blood derived-msc, which increased chemotaxis  <cit> .

like other g-protein coupled receptors, cxcr <dig> undergoes internalization after interaction with ligand. ligand-induced endocytosis of cxcr <dig> and its internal sequestration has been extensively studied in leukocytes  <cit>  and to a lesser degree in hematopoietic stem cells  <cit>  and tumour cells  <cit> . although these studies confirm the existence of a general regulatory mechanism, the extent of intracellular expression and endocytosis/recycling kinetics differs between cell types, implicating cellular context in the regulation of cxcr <dig> trafficking and its functional consequences  <cit> . the predominant intracellular localization of cxcr <dig> suggests that dynamic equilibrium between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane may modulate cxcr <dig> availability at the cell surface, and thus fmsc responsiveness to sdf-1α gradients.

we investigated the intracellular localization and trafficking of cxcr <dig> in fetal bone marrow msc, and treated fmsc with blebbistatin and dynasore, specific inhibitors of myosin iia and dynamin subunits of the actin cytoskeleton responsible for cytoskeletal movement and chemotaxis, and commonly associated with g-protein endocytosis. our findings demonstrate that surface expression of cxcr <dig> on fmsc and their sdf-1α induced-chemotaxis in vitro can be increased through inhibition of receptor endocytosis. these data support further development of small molecule agents to up-regulate the functional expression of a key receptor involved in homing and engraftment of msc.

methods
msc culture
fetal tissue was collected from consenting women undergoing clinically indicated termination of pregnancy in accordance with national guidelines and as approved by the human research ethics committee of the royal brisbane and women’s hospital. early trimester bone marrow msc  derived from different donors  and adult bone marrow msc  from a bone marrow donor were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  high glucose  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 100 iu/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin , expanded at  <dig> cells/cm <dig> at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  isolated fmsc and amsc were characterised by typical cell surface phenotype and differentiation capacity as previously reported  <cit> . antibodies used to characterize msc are listed in  <cit> . mesodermal differentiation methods are described in the additional file  <dig> 

priming fmsc with endocytosis inhibitors
for flow cytometry, cells were primed with -blebbistatin  and dynasore hydrate -hydrazide hydrate, cat. # d <dig>  sigma aldrich) as follows: cells were detached with tryple select and washed twice with serum-free dmem. cells were resuspended in 600 μl of dmem not containing fcs but with 25 mm hepes  with blebbistatin or dynasore added at a concentration of 80 μm. cells were incubated at 37°c for  <dig>   <dig> or 60 min. for morphology and immunofluorescence studies, cells were seeded into  <dig> well plates with or without glass coverslips. when confluent, cells were washed once with dmem and treated as indicated. treatment media consisted of 250 μl of dmem + 25 mm hepes without fcs and 80 μm blebbistatin or dynasore as necessary. vehicle treatment was  <dig> % dmso in the same media, equivalent to the amount of dmso in 80 μm blebbistatin solution. cells were imaged immediately or washed with pbs, fixed with 1% pfa in pbs ph  <dig>  for 10 min, washed and stored in pbs at 4°c.

flow cytometry
for flow cytometry, cells were detached using tryple reagent . the antibodies used are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  because of expression differences with different commercially available antibodies, we detected intracellular and extracellular cxcr <dig> using a monoclonal anti-human cxcr <dig> pe-cy <dig> conjugated antibody  following the manufacturer’s instructions , a non-conjugated polyclonal antibody  and/or a biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibody . for indirect staining with the polyclonal antibody, cells were incubated with primary antibody at 4°c for 30 min then washed once with pbs + 2% fcs. after washing cells were resuspended and incubated with fitc- or alexa  <dig> conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody or pe- or fitc labelled streptavidin at 4°c for 30 min. after incubation cells were washed three times with pbs. for intracellular staining for detection of total cellular cxcr <dig> , cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde  for 10 min, permeabilised with  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  for 10 min, and stained with anti-human cxcr4-pe cy <dig> for 30 min. cells were analysed by facs calibur  or gallios . for flow cytometry experiments the isotype controls, analysis gates were optimized on each flow cytometer, for permeablized or intact cells, and for each antibody, fluorophore and cell line used according to standard practice. for cytoplasmic staining, cells were fixed and permeabilised as above. cells were then stained with cxcr4-pe-cy <dig>  and incubated for 5 min in  <dig>  m acetic acid  to remove surface bound antibody. surface cxcr <dig> was expressed as a percentage of total cxcr <dig> as follows:  ×  <dig>  the cxcr <dig> antibodies were validated using thp- <dig> cells , a control cell haematopoietic cell with constitutively high surface expression. antibodies were also assessed in human cervical carcinoma hela cells  cultured in msc medium.

immunofluorescence microscopy
fmsc  were cultured on glass coverslips and then fixed with 4% pfa in pbs  for 10 min at room temperature  <cit> . cells were washed with pbs, and then incubated with blocking and permeabilisation buffer  for 1 hr at room temperature. blocking buffer was discarded and antibodies were diluted in diluent buffer  and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°c. rabbit anti-cxcr <dig>  and either mouse anti-rab <dig>  anti-rab11a, or anti-lamp <dig>  was added. after incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed  <dig> × 5 min and secondary anti-mouse-alexa  <dig> and anti-rabbit alexa  <dig>  were added. cells were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hr and then washed  <dig> × 5 min. coverslips were placed on microscope slides with prolong gold with dapi mounting medium .

for blebbistatin and dynasore treatment experiments, coverslips were treated with  <dig> % gelatin for 10 min prior to seeding or seeded onto fibronectin coated chamber slides. after inhibitor treatment, cells were fixed with prewarmed 1% pfa for 10 min at rt, blocked in 1% bsa with  <dig> % tween in pbs for permeabilisation for 1 hr prior to proceeding with antibody staining. tween was omitted for surface cxcr <dig> staining. antibodies were diluted in pbs. four x 30 sec washes were carried out after each antibody incubation. slides were examined on a zeiss axio epi-fluorescence or lsm  <dig> confocal microscope.

in situ proximity ligation assay 
cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed with pfa as per immunofluorescence microscopy . cells were permeabilised with  <dig> % tween in pbs for 10 min at room temperature. the duolink ii proximity ligation assay  was carried out as per manufacturer’s instructions and using supplied reagents for a 1 cm <dig> reaction volume. primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°c - rabbit anti-cxcr <dig>  and either mouse anti-rab <dig> , anti-rab11a  or anti-lamp <dig>  were used. the positive control was the pla reaction between rabbit anti-growth hormone receptor  clone h <dig>  and the mouse anti-ghr clone 3a <dig> , as these  <dig> different antibodies detect different epitopes of the ghr protein.

transwell assays
fetal msc were detached using tryple reagent , washed twice in pbs, and resuspended in dmem. cells were stained for 8 min at room temperature with cfse  and the reaction was then inactivated by adding pbs with 2% fcs. cells were washed twice and resuspended in dmem with no fcs. cells were treated with either endocytosis inhibitors or vehicle only  for 1 hr. 300 μl of fmsc suspension  were placed in the upper compartments of a fluoroblok transwell migration chamber . the transwell membrane  was coated with fibronectin  <dig>  μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature, then washed with water and allowed to air-dry. sdf-1α was placed in the lower compartment . cells were allowed to undergo chemotaxis for 4 hours and then migration was determined by fluorescence intensity in the bottom well using the paradigm fluorescence plate reader . each experiment was performed in triplicate. the migration index was calculated as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of cells migrating towards the chemo-attractant to the fluorescence intensity of cells migrating towards media alone.

adhesion assays
for adhesion assays, cfse stained cells  were incubated in fibronectin or collagen i coated wells of 96-well plates in dmem containing no fbs at 37°c and 5% co <dig> for 1 hr, and then washed with dmem without fbs. the number of adherent cells/well was estimated by reading the fluorescence intensity with the paradigm microplate reader.

quantitative wound healing assay
migration was assessed by performing scratch wound assays in a real-time cell imaging system . briefly,  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well were plated into an essen-costar  <dig> well plate coated with  <dig> % gelatin . twenty four hours later, the confluent monolayer of cells was washed 1x pbs, scratched with the essen bioscience  <dig> well plate scratcher, incubated with blebbistatin or dynasore as above . the media was removed and normal growth media added, plates were transferred to the incucyte live cell imaging system and the essen  <dig> well wound assay protocol was run on the software. cells were imaged at 4 hr intervals for 24 hr to monitor cell migration. wound confluence was calculated automatically by the incucyte software  for 12 hr, i.e. until wounds were greater than 90% confluent. the data were then analysed using an integrated metric: relative wound density.

statistical analysis
normally-distributed data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and analysed by paired t-test and anova. p <  <dig>  was considered significant. all experiments were conducted in triplicate or with a minimum of  <dig> independent donor-derived fmsc, unless otherwise stated. for scratch wound, a 2-way anova with bonferroni correction was used .

RESULTS
fetal bone marrow derived-msc exhibit typical msc characteristics
isolated fmsc and amsc were characterised by typical cell surface phenotype and differentiation capacity as previously reported  <cit> . cultured msc met the criteria set by the international society for cellular therapy  <cit> , being plastic adherent, fibroblastic in morphology and able to differentiate osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages in vitro . fetal msc were positive for the various msc markers  and were negative for hematopoietic and endothelial markers  .

cxcr <dig> expression is predominantly intracellular and localized to the endosomal, lysosomal and nuclear compartment of fmsc
only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of fetal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells  displayed positive surface immune staining for cxcr <dig> . however, when cells were fixed and permeabilised, ~50-90% of fmsc stained positive for intracellularly localised cxcr <dig> . this low surface and high intracellular cxcr <dig> staining pattern was observed regardless of the anti-cxcr <dig> antibody clone used  or the method of antibody detection . furthermore, detaching fmsc with enzymatic  or chemical methods  produced only a modest change in cxcr <dig>  antibody surface staining . therefore, enzymatic degradation of the cxcr <dig> is not a major reason for low surface cxcr <dig> expression observed in this study. a similar low surface/high intracellular cxcr <dig> immuno-positivity was seen for adult bone marrow msc , as previously reported  <cit> . this is in contrast to thp- <dig> monocytic leukemic and hela cell lines, that both displayed a high percentage of cells with surface cxcr <dig> immuno-positivity  and previously reported migration capacity to sdf- <dig>  the cxcr <dig> ligand  <cit> .

although cytoplasmic sequestration of cxcr <dig> has been described in adult bone marrow and decidual msc  <cit> , the internal distribution of cxcr <dig> has not to date been characterised in any msc. two cxcr <dig> antibody clones  detected an even surface distribution of cxcr <dig> on a small number of fmsc by immuno-fluorescence microscopy . this supported the flow cytometry data that determined only  <dig>  ±  <dig> % fmsc had positive cxcr <dig> surface immuno-reactivity . permeabilization of cells with triton-x showed cxcr <dig> to be localized in punctate endosomal/lysosomal-like compartments , some of which aligned to the cytoskeleton or nuclear membrane . however, the third anti-cxcr <dig>  antibody tested, produced a different pattern of diffuse punctate cytoplasmic staining with a large accumulation of cxcr <dig> in the nucleus . antibody staining conditions were optimized as described in the additional information, but this did not change the nuclear localization of cxcr <dig> detected by the ab <dig> antibody . we thus examined the localization of cxcr <dig> using well-characterised markers of the endocytotic pathway, rab <dig> and rab <dig> for early/recycling endosomes, and lamp- <dig> for lysosomes. immuno-fluorescence staining of fmsc revealed a similar diffuse punctate distribution of anti-cxcr <dig>  antibody with both rab <dig> and rab <dig> labelled endosomes . subcellular localization patterns of rab <dig> and rab <dig> were confirmed by transient transfection of fmsc and hela cells . cxcr <dig> staining on immuno-fluorescence microscopy also overlapped with lamp <dig>  although lamp <dig> displayed a different peri-nuclear location .to confirm co-localization of cxcr <dig> in endosomal compartments, an in cell co-immunoprecipation  was conducted . anti-cxcr <dig> antibody successfully co-localized with rab <dig>  rab <dig> and lamp <dig>  with each red spot indicating a point of co-localization. positive and negative controls for the pla assay shown in figure 2h support the specificity of these cxcr <dig> interactions. these pla results are consistent with the immunofluorescence microscopy, and indicate that cytoplasmic cxcr <dig> in fmsc is distributed within all three endosomal compartments.

to investigate what drives internalization of cxcr <dig>  we investigated whether endogenously-produced sdf-1α, the cxcr <dig> ligand highly expressed in msc  <cit> , could trigger this endocytosis of cxcr <dig> through a ligand-dependent process. fetal msc expressed very low levels of cxcr <dig> mrna, consistent with recycling of receptors rather than synthesis . although fmsc expressed high levels of sdf-1α mrna , treatment of fmsc cultures with a neutralizing antibody against sdf-1α produced only a moderate increase in cell surface expression of cxcr <dig>  as measured by mean fluorescent intensity  on flow cytometry . this suggests although ligand-dependent endocytosis occurs, it cannot account for all and particularly basal receptor internalization, and thus an overriding constitutive mechanism is likely to be responsible for the cxcr <dig> trafficking pattern observed.

treatment with endocytosis inhibitors increases cxcr <dig> surface expression
given the large proportion of cxcr <dig> located within the endosomal compartment, we explored the regulatory mechanism responsible by using two inhibitors of endocytosis, blebbistatin and dynasore, to probe the dynamics of cxcr <dig> trafficking. blebbistatin is an inhibitor of non-muscle myosin ii and inhibits endocytosis, while dynasore is a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin i and dynamin ii proteins with important roles in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. fmsc were initially treated with different concentrations  of either blebbistatin or dynasore. after 30 min the highest levels of surface cxcr <dig> expression determined by flow cytometry  were achieved at a concentration of 80 μm for both agents . quantitatively similar results were obtained using a different anti-cxcr <dig> antibody  and an indirect staining method on adult msc . to determine the kinetics of cxcr <dig> receptor exocytosis, fmsc were treated with 80 μm blebbistatin or dynasore  at 37°c and the cells then collected at select time points. the cells were stained with cxcr <dig> antibody , fixed and the level of surface and cytoplasmic cxcr <dig> expression examined by flow cytometry. blebbistatin resulted in a return of cxcr <dig> to the cell surface with maximal surface expression  reaching steady state after 1 hour . dynasore treatment revealed a similar return of surface expression of cxcr <dig>  but with a lower maximal level  compared with blebbistatin. after two hours, cxcr <dig> surface expression was maintained stably at a level around  <dig> fold higher than untreated control msc, but returned to baseline over the subsequent 6 hours . these endocytosis inhibitors also reduced ligand-induced internalization of cxcr <dig> in thp- <dig> cells. this hematopoietic leukemic cell line served as a control cell type with >90% endogenous surface expression when untreated, whereas sdf- <dig> treatment induced rapid internalization of cxcr <dig> . however, co-incubation of thp- <dig> cells with sdf- <dig> and blebbistatin or dynasore kept the surface levels of cxcr <dig> similar to untreated .

translocation kinetics and modelling indicates cxcr <dig> endocytosis rate regulates surface expression of cxcr4
at steady state, the relative distribution of a membrane protein between the surface and interior of cells is determined by the ratio of the recycling to endocytosis rate constants. inhibition of endocytosis in fmsc with blebbistatin and dynasore permits an approximation of a recycling rate  and thus derivation of the endocytosis rate . the high rate of basal endocytosis is consistent with high cytoplasmic sequestration of cxcr <dig> and the low surface expression we document in fmsc.

additional file 6: figure s5b shows the fit of the above model to the experimental data obtained before and after treatment with blebbistatin or dynasore. simulations using rate constants derived from the experimental data show levels of cxcr <dig> surface expression of  <dig> % for resting fmsc, 35% for blebbistatin and 26% for dynasore. additional file 6: figure s5c shows a simulation in which the total cellular cxcr <dig> is initially present in the intracellular pool. as the system approaches equilibrium, cxcr <dig> is transferred from the cytoplasmic compartment to the cell surface. simulations show that the level of membrane expression of cxcr <dig> in fmsc is sensitive to the rate of endocytosis . the series of theoretical curves generated demonstrate how ke and kr inter-determine the level of cxcr <dig> receptor surface expression and internalization in fmsc. additional file 6: figure s5c shows the effect on receptor cell surface expression level of varying ke while maintaining kr at its basal rate . when ke is small, little internalization is seen and a large proportion of cxcr <dig> in present on the cell surface , but as ke rises, a greater proportion of receptors are found inside the cell at steady state. thus, fmsc that exhibit small kr and large ke have substantial levels of internalization. the model also demonstrates that altering the rate of endocytosis independent of the recycling rate is sufficient to cause substantial receptor re-surfacing. the model supports the rate of endocytosis of cxcr <dig> being a critical regulatory point for surface expression of cxcr <dig> in fmsc, and one amenable to manipulation.

transient effect of endocytosis inhibitors on fmsc morphology and cytoskeleton arrangement
the treatment of blebbistatin and dynasore had a marked effect on the morphology and fragility of cells . inhibitor treatment altered the morphology of the cells’ cytoskeleton within 15 min to a more rounded cell type with projections , which continued to increase over the 60 min treatment time. however, 24 hr after treatment was stopped, the cells regained their usual shape. this was enhanced by the fact there were no serum or attachment factors in the media and further the vehicle, dmso, elicited a partial loss of actin cytoskeleton polymerization . the change in structural features in the fmsc with different treatments is illustrated in the schematic shown in figure 4d. where a monolayer of cells was less confluent, the inhibitor treatment had a more dramatic effect on morphology than areas with higher cell density .when the cellular distribution of cxcr <dig> and rab <dig> following blebbistatin treatment was assessed by microscopy, there was little change in the size or distribution of the endocytotic vesicles, or in the number of cxcr4+ endosomes .

partial inhibition of endocytosis does not adversely affect directional migration and can augment cxcr <dig> function
we next investigated whether cxcr <dig> retained functionality after treatment with blebbistatin and dynasore. it had been reported that blebbistatin can disrupt cell migration  <cit> , although other reports suggested it may have little adverse impact on, or even enhance, cellular migration  <cit> . accordingly we performed a scratch wound assay to determine if pre-treatment of fmsc with either inhibitor alters directional migration. blebbistatin or dynasore did not affect migration of cells into the in vitro wound zone .

adhesion to extracellular matrix  proteins is important not only for tissue cohesion but also cell migration  <cit> . therefore, we assessed adhesion of treated and untreated fmsc to two ecm components, fibronectin and type i collagen. interestingly, treatment with blebbistatin and dynasore reduced adhesion to both fibronectin and collagen i by up to a third  compared to untreated fmsc . this suggests a role for these inhibitors in cell mobilisation, likely via disruption of the cytoskeleton . chemotaxis of fmsc was then examined in a transwell assay. fmsc were either treated with 80 μm blebbistatin or 80 μm dynasore, or control-treated with vehicle . cells were exposed to the inhibitors for 1 hour to maximize cell surface expression of cxcr <dig> prior to being placed in the top chamber of transwell plates. migration to three different concentrations of sdf- <dig>  was determined after 4 hours . both blebbistatin and dynasore enhanced chemotaxis toward sdf-1α compared to control cells, by over two fold at all concentrations examined .

effect of endocytosis inhibitors on fmsc viability and differentiation
to exclude any adverse impact of treating fmsc with inhibitors on cell viability and osteogenic/adipogenic differentiation, fmsc were exposed to differing concentrations of blebbistatin for 1 hour, then counted and live/dead discrimination determined. measures of cell survival including picogreen assay for dna content and 7-aad flow cytometry staining showed no effect of 1 hour of blebbistatin treatment . only blebbistatin was tested as this increased the level of surface cxcr <dig> expression the greatest.

to ensure transient treatment with blebbistatin and dynasore do not have long-term effects on mesenchymal differentiation, fmsc exposed to either blebbistatin or dynasore for 2 hours, and the cells then cultured under standard inductive conditions for 3 weeks. all cultures showed evidence of the relevant osteogenic or adipogenic differentiation after staining with alizarin red or oil red o . thus, short-term blebbistatin and dynasore exposure had no lasting detrimental effect on fmsc that would hinder in vivo use after inhibitor treatment.

discussion
we report a role for cxcr <dig> receptor trafficking in the migration of first trimester fetal msc toward sdf- <dig>  fmsc showed a large intracellular pool of cxcr <dig> protein , but only marginal expression of cxcr <dig> on the cell surface. in this basal state, internal sequestration of cxcr <dig> was associated with only modest migration of naïve fmsc toward sdf- <dig>  immunofluorescence microscopy and in situ pla experiments examining the relationship between cxcr <dig> and components of the endosomal compartment showed that cxcr <dig> receptors were present within rab5+ and rab11+ endosomes, with another fraction residing within lamp1+ late endosomes/lysosomes   <cit> . the kinetic profile of cxcr <dig> trafficking in fmsc as supported by translocation modelling indicates that cxcr <dig> endocytosis rate regulates surface expression of cxcr <dig>  together this indicates a state of accelerated internalization of cxcr <dig> in resting fmsc , which when relieved by inhibition of endocytosis led to an increase in cxcr <dig> surface expression and potentiated fmsc migration toward an sdf-1α gradient in transwell assays .

flow cytometry data indicate that there was up to 10-fold increased cxcr <dig> expression at the cell surface after blebbistatin treatment . however this was difficult to confirm conclusively with microscopy due to the differences in sensitivity between the two techniques and the low total expression of cxcr <dig> in fmsc, or alternatively perhaps because inhibiting endocytosis is not the main mechanism of the increase in surface cxcr <dig>  this 5-10-fold increase in surface cxcr <dig> expression, with a  <dig>  fold increase in migration index, is superior to what has been reported for genetic over-expression of cxcr <dig>  recently marquez-curtis et al. reported that non-transfected human fetal umbilical cord blood-derived -msc had <2% cxcr4+ population  <cit> . however, after transiently transfecting with a cxcr <dig> expression construct, 40% of cells were cxcr4+, resulting in a ~3-fold increased migration to sdf- <dig>  furthermore, marquez-curtis et al. claim their transient transfection method in fetal ucb-msc produced superior results to other expression methods in adult rat msc, which although increased cxcr <dig> expression to 54-95% of cells, but showed a mere 2– <dig> fold increased migration to sdf- <dig>  <cit> .

the marked effect of blebbistatin and dynasore on cytoskeletal morphology is not unexpected as mechanistically they transiently disrupt cytoskeletal components myosin iia and dynamin  <cit> . therefore, a small molecule with reversible effects, such as blebbistatin, is likely to be more effective at enhancing migration rather than over expression or knock down approaches to a single chemokine receptor/ligand. however, this cytoskeletal disruption also makes the cells less adherent and more sensitive to handling.

although we only used one adult msc donor in this study, the small number of cells expressing cxcr <dig> at the plasma membrane was similar to what we found with nine fetal msc donors and as reported by others for adult msc  <cit> . surface expression of cxcr <dig> reported in adult msc has been variable, in the range of 2-25% of cells  <cit> . in keeping with this, there was a disparity between the 4% of cells we found with surface cxcr <dig> expression in first trimester bone marrow fmsc compared to the jones et al. figure of 23% in blood-derived fmsc  <cit> . indeed discrepancies on levels of other fmsc markers in particular oct <dig>  between our collaborating laboratories was the subject of a recent review  <cit> . this difference in cxcr <dig> expression might reflect inherent biological variation in msc samples  coupled with differing methods of culture  or different antibodies used in analysis.

our finding of nuclear localized cxcr <dig> in bone marrow fmsc is consistent with recent findings in blood fmsc  <cit> . the human cxcr <dig> contains a nuclear localization motif  <cit>  and nuclear cxcr <dig> translocation has been reported to be a negative prognostic marker in several highly proliferative cancers  <cit> . furthermore, a number of studies have found, similar to our study, that different antibody clones against cxcr <dig> can show disparate subcellular localization patterns, including some with nuclear localization and others with cytoplasmic localization of cxcr <dig>  <cit> . this could be due to the epitope recognised by the antibody; for example the epitope of the cxcr <dig> ab <dig> antibody, which we found to detect the nuclear cxcr <dig>  is the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> residues of which differ between the cxcr <dig> mrna splice variants  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a number of molecular weight forms of cxcr <dig> protein have been described by western blotting of various cells and tissues, which have been determined to be due to splice variants, dimeric receptors, and post-translational modifications  <cit> .

fetal msc express both cxcr <dig> and its ligand sdf- <dig> as confirmed here. reports of an inverse correlation between cxcr <dig> and sdf- <dig> expression by msc  <cit> , is one possible explanation for our finding. that is, endogenously produced sdf- <dig> binds surface cxcr <dig>  induces internalization of cxcr <dig>  and potentially forms a suppressive autocrine loop down regulating cxcr <dig> expression. to investigate this we showed that treatment with a neutralizing antibody against sdf- <dig>  resulted in only a small increase in surface expression of cxcr <dig> . furthermore, prolonged treatment or increased antibody concentration, which would be expected to lessen autocrine suppression, did not restore cxcr <dig> surface expression to a substantial level. thus while autocrine sdf- <dig> may trigger some ligand-dependent cxcr <dig> internalization, this is not the principal mechanism responsible for intracellular localization of cxcr <dig> in fmsc. these data also support previous findings in non-msc cell lines  <cit> .

the chemokine receptor and other migratory mechanisms in msc are not well understood, leading to seemingly contradictory findings in the literature  <cit> . this may be due to different migratory assays detecting different type of cellular movements. similarly, we found that blebbistatin and dynasore did not have any effect on two dimensional migration in the scratch wound assay, but did have a significant increase in the number of cells that migrated in transwell assay in response to sdf- <dig>  in the transwell assay, cells migrate through a membrane in response to a chemotactic ligand , mimicking an in vivo injury paradigm. different migratory effects observed may also depend on the suite of chemokine receptors and ligand isoforms expressed by msc, and the in vitro or in vivo environment  <cit> . furthermore, a number of studies ignore the capacity of cxcr <dig> to cross talk with other receptors directly or indirectly, especially the heterodimerizing cxcr4-cxcr <dig> pair  <cit>  or have alternative ligands  <cit> . nor do they take into account that the ligands of cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> homo- and heterodimeric complexes, sdf- <dig> and mif, are highly expressed by msc  <cit> . park et al. demonstrated cxcr4-overexpressing msc displayed enhanced migration to sdf- <dig>  but more so to glioma-conditioned media, which contains a multitude of migratory factors  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study is the first to propose a reversible, small molecule method for enhancing msc migration. understanding the novel role of the cytoplasmic and nuclear localised cxcr <dig> described here may further augment fetal msc migration for translation therapeutic uses.

flow cytometry of cxcr <dig> expression by msc control cell lines. three different anti-cxcr <dig> antibody clones were used 12g <dig>  ab <dig> and  <dig> as detailed in the methods, with fluorophore labelled secondary antibodies used where necessary. a) fetal msc cxcr <dig> surface expression  by flow cytometry shown as histograms plots . b) after permeabilization, the majority of cells show intracellular stores of cxcr <dig>  red histogram indicates isotype control. human adult bone marrow msc also show low expression of cxcr <dig> on the cell surface  but large intracellular store of this receptor . e and f) all the anti-cxcr <dig> antibodies are able to detect >80% cells with surface expression of cxcr <dig> on hela human cervical cancer cells. g) both the anti-cxcr <dig> antibodies 12g <dig> and ab <dig> are able to detect >80% cells with surface expression of cxcr <dig> on thp- <dig> human monocytic leukaemia cells. h) fetal msc were detached with tryple trypsin replacement or 5 mm edta and stained with cxcr <dig>  antibody to assess the effect of enzymatic dissociation on the number of cells staining positive for surface cxcr <dig>

optimization of the fixation and permeabilisation conditions for the anti-cxcr <dig>  antibody in fmsc or hela cells.  fmsc or hela cells were fixed and permeabilised as follows : methanol, 4% paraformaldehyde  +  <dig> % triton and pfa +  <dig> % tween, and then stained with cxcr <dig>  as detailed in the methods section. the negative control was pfa + triton treated cells but the primary cxcr <dig> antibody omitted. c) hela cells with the anti cxcr <dig> antibody clone ab <dig> or 12g <dig>  where the cells were fixed in pfa to show surface staining or treated with pfa + triton to show intracellular staining. d and e) fetal msc and hela cells were transiently transfected with rab5-gfp or rab11-gfp constructs to ensure the accuracy of the rab antibody staining. note that rab5-gfp shows classic punctate endosomal localization in both fmsc and hela, whereas the rab <dig> shows diffuse cytoplasmic localization in fmsc and classical endosomal punctae in the hela cells, similar to antibody staining in figure  <dig>

two compartment modelling of cxcr <dig> trafficking.  real time pcr for sdf-1: expression of sdf- <dig> in fmsc  shows sdf- <dig> and cxcr <dig> transcripts relative to the housekeeping gene gapdh. b) kinetics of cxcr <dig> exocytosis in fmsc after treatment with endocytosis inhibitors: cells were treated with 80 μm blebbistatin or 80 μm dynasore then fixed and stained with anti-cxcr <dig>  surface expression was determined by flow cytometry and data fitted to a two-compartment model of endocytosis . c) fit of cxcr <dig> surface expression data for naïve , blebbistatin-  and dynasore-treated cells  to the two compartment model. simulation was initiated with cytoplasm  containing the entire cellular cxcr <dig>  response of surface expression to changes in the endocytosis rate : kr was maintained at  <dig>  min− <dig> while ke was varied from  <dig>  min− <dig> to  <dig>  min− <dig>  d) data that was used in the mathematical modelling of cxcr <dig> trafficking.

endocytosis inhibitors have a rapid but transient effect on fmsc morphology. light microscopy images show morphology of fmsc rapidly changes from wide flattened fibroblast-like state  to cells that become rounded in the centre with long projections after vehicle , blebbistatin and dynasore treatment. cell morphology returns to normal by 24 hr post treatment and removal of the reagents .
