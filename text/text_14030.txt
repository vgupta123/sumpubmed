BACKGROUND
the human genome contains over  <dig> genes with similarity to dna transposases  <cit> . in addition, transposons are a major source of structural genetic variation in human populations  <cit> . recently, human thap <dig> and pgbd <dig> have been found to mobilize transposons in human cells  <cit> . this discovery raises the possibility that, similar to the rag <dig> recombinase  <cit> , these endogenous human transposases may catalyze human genome rearrangements during normal somatic cell development or in distinct disease states. the human genome contains thousands of genetic elements with apparent sequence similarity to transposons, but their evolutionary divergence hinders the identification of elements that may serve as substrates for endogenous human transposases in general  <cit> , and pgbd <dig> in particular  <cit> .

in classical genetics, forward chemical genetic screens have been successfully used to identify spontaneous mutations in bacteria, yeast and fly . such approaches use dna sequencing of cells based on chemical resistance due to positive or negative phenotypic selection. for forward genetics of mammalian and human cells, mutational analysis of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig>  gene based on the resistance to toxic purine analogues such as 8-aza- or 6-thio-guanine  has been used; for overview, see  <cit> . analysis of hprt <dig> has several advantages for forward genetic screens: i) hprt <dig> is on the x chromosome and therefore functionally hemizygous, ii) hprt <dig> encodes a single domain globular protein in which alterations of any of its nine exons are expected to affect enzymatic activity, and iii) mutations can be selected both positively and negatively, enabling the specific identification of distinct mutations, as opposed to general factors controlling cellular genomic stability. indeed, hprt1-based forward genetic screens have been successfully used to characterize chemical mutagens  <cit> . in human lymphocytes, this assay has also been used to identify rag1-mediated mutations of hprt <dig>  and to elucidate cryptic recombination signal sequences  <cit> .

here, we sought to develop a forward genetic screening approach suitable for the elucidation of endogenous genomic substrates of human dna transposases and recombinases. depending on cell type and presence of endogenous co-factors, this assay should allow for dna transposition and recombination, or alternatively, nuclease-mediated dna rearrangements facilitated by endogenous dna sequence substrate preferences. using negative and positive thioguanine resistance selection, combined with massively parallel dna sequencing, we used hprt <dig> screening to investigate the nuclease activity of pgbd <dig> on human genomic substrates.

RESULTS
the human hprt <dig> gene contains  <dig> annotated dna transposon copies . these transposons are only distantly related to piggybac transposons that are evolutionarily related to the potential substrates of pgbd <dig>  <cit> . we hypothesized that under strong selective pressure, pgbd <dig> may exhibit enzymatic activity on sequences in the hprt <dig> gene with sufficient similarity to its endogenous substrates, be they piggybac-related sequences or not. to test this hypothesis, we adapted the hprt <dig> mutation assay in which cells containing inactivating hprt <dig> mutations can be negatively or positively selected by growth in media containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine  or thioguanine, respectively  <cit> . to maximize the sensitivity of this assay, we used male bj fibroblasts containing a single copy of the x-linked hprt <dig> gene  <cit> .

to analyze specific changes induced by human pgbd <dig>  we generated isogenic cell lines by using lentiviral transduction to express gfp-pgbd <dig> and control gfp, and confirmed stable and equal transgene expression using immunoblotting . to eliminate hprt <dig> variants induced by spontaneous gene mutations and enable the specific selection of those induced by pgbd <dig>  we grew cells in the presence of hat medium for  <dig> doublings  <cit> . we confirmed that the expression of gfp-pgbd <dig> did not alter the intrinsic sensitivity of bj cells to thioguanine, as assessed using clonogenic assays and analysis of the dose–response to thioguanine by these cells . the fractional clonogenic efficiencies of thioguanine resistance induction were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for cells expressing gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig>  respectively, estimated from the number of thioguanine-resistant colonies, consistent with the lack of general mutagenic activity by pgbd <dig>  <cit> . to generate cells with de novo hprt <dig> mutations, we grew cells expressing gfp-pgbd <dig> or gfp control in the presence of thioguanine for  <dig> cell divisions, corresponding to approximately  <dig> month in culture. to confirm the generation of clones with inactivating hprt <dig> mutations, we determined the ability of thioguanine-selected cells to grow in the hat medium. we observed more than  <dig> -fold decrease in the number of viable cells upon hat treatment, indicating that the majority of the cells had acquired resistance to thioguanine . consistent with the inactivation of hprt <dig> in these cells, thioguanine-selected cells exhibited increased resistance to acute treatment with thioguanine as compared to unselected control cells . in agreement with this notion, we observed no detectable hprt <dig> protein expression by immunoblotting , suggesting that the majority of thioguanine-resistant cells inactivated hprt <dig> due to mutations that led to the loss of hprt <dig> protein expression.fig.  <dig> induction of thioguanine resistance and loss of hprt <dig> expression in isogenic cells expressing dna transposase pgbd <dig>  a stable expression of gfp-pgbd <dig> and control gfp in bj-htert cells, as assessed by western blotting against gfp; β-actin serves as loading control. b clonogenic efficiency of bj-htert cells stably expressing gfp  and gfp-pgbd <dig>  as a function of varying thioguanine concentrations upon thioguanine resistance selection. c representative photographs of resistant colonies stained with crystal violet. d thioguanine selection of both gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> expressing cells yields cells that lack hprt <dig> activity, as assessed by hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine  treatment; *** denotes p =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> for the comparisons between control and thioguanine selected gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig>  respectively. d thioguanine selection yields thioguanine-resistant cells, as assessed by cellular atp luminescence assay of gfp  and gfp-pgbd <dig>  expressing cells, as compared to control cells . e western blot for hprt <dig> in bj-htert cells expressing gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> upon thioguanine selection; β-actin serves as loading control. all error bars represent standard deviations of  <dig> biological replicates



prior structural studies of hprt <dig> gene mutations have used southern blotting or cdna sequencing  <cit> , limiting the detection and sequence analysis of structural variants that involve rearrangements of introns and other non-exonic sequences. to overcome these limitations and enable comprehensive and sensitive sequence analysis of rearrangements involving potential transposon sequences in hprt <dig>  we designed a specific panel of polymerase chain reaction  amplicons spanning the entire  <dig> kb sequence of the human hprt <dig> gene, including introns, exons, and 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions . massively parallel paired-end dna sequencing of the resultant amplicons, producing millions of sequence reads spanning the hprt <dig> locus, should enable the recovery of rare dna mutations without the need for single cell cloning that is limited by clonal fitness, as observed for rag1-induced hprt <dig> mutations in lymphocytes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> massively parallel dna sequencing combined with pcr amplification for high-resolution mutational analysis of hprt <dig>  a schematic of the human hprt <dig> gene structure with vertical bars and horizontal arrows denoting exons and amplicons as numbered. b photograph of ethidium bromide-stained and electrophoretically-resolved hprt <dig> pcr amplicons of genomic dna isolated from gfp  and gfp-pgbd <dig>  expressing cells before  and after  thioguanine resistance selection



to test this prediction, we isolated genomic dna from thioguanine-resistant cells expressing gfp-pgbd <dig> or gfp, and amplified their hprt <dig> loci using long-range pcr . consistent with prior observations of hprt <dig> mutations that were either subclonal or involved variants not resolvable by electrophoresis  <cit> , resultant amplicons exhibited no apparent differences in electrophoretic gel mobility between thioguanine-resistant and control cells in the presence or absence of pgbd <dig> . to facilitate the recovery of polyclonal populations of hprt <dig> mutants, we used massively parallel paired-end illumina dna sequencing of resultant genomic amplicons to generate more than  <dig>  sequence reads at 99 % of nucleotide bases. these data have been deposited to the sequence read archive , with the processed and annotated data available from the dryad digital repository .

to enable comprehensive analysis of pgbd5-induced hprt <dig> mutations, we combined two recently developed algorithms crispresso and lasv that permit the identification and analysis of both small and large structural variants in ultra-high coverage dna sequencing data at base-pair resolution  <cit> . we observed that both gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> expressing cells acquired single nucleotide and small indel mutations of hprt <dig> . consistent with the functional loss of hprt <dig> expression , we observed a relative excess of exonic as compared to intronic variants in thioguanine-resistant cells . there was no significant difference in the frequencies of single nucleotide and small indel mutations of hprt <dig> between gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> expressing cells . although both gfp-pgbd <dig> and gfp expressing cells developed thioguanine resistance at least in part due to the acquisition of inactivating single nucleotide and small indel mutations, this finding suggests that pgbd <dig> activity on human genomic substrates does not directly generate such mutations at the efficiency required for thioguanine resistance selection.fig.  <dig> comprehensive genomic analysis of hprt <dig> mutations reveals pgbd5-mediated induction of complex genomic rearrangements. a  distribution of the mutational frequency  and the location  of single nucleotide variants  and small indels in hprt <dig> of cells before  and after  thioguanine resistance selection. exons are denoted by gray bars.  comparative analysis of the frequencies of snvs and indels in hprt <dig> before  and after  thioguanine resistance selection reveals no significant differences between gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> expressing cells; * and ** denote p <  <dig>  and p <  <dig>  for exonic and intronic variants, respectively . b combined comparative analysis of the frequencies of snvs and indels in hprt <dig> in gfp and gfp-pgbd <dig> expressing cells . c distribution of the locations of the 5′ ends of complex structural variants in cells before  and after  thioguanine resistance selection, as detected by lasv and marked by arrows denoting deletions , inversions , duplications , and translocations . black arrows mark annotated dna transposons. d expression of gfp-pgbd <dig> leads to induction of complex structural variants before  and after  thioguanine resistance selection 



on the other hand, we observed that cells expressing gfp-pgbd <dig> had an excess of complex structural variants as compared to gfp control cells . specifically, we found that pgbd5-expressing cells contained significantly greater numbers of inversions in hprt <dig> as compared to control gfp cells  and also contained significantly greater total numbers of complex structural variants  . furthermore we observed that some rearrangements occurred in the absence of thioguanine selection. this is consistent with the preserved nuclease activity of pgbd <dig> which may induce such structural rearrangements in human genomes by virtue of dna double strand breaks alone, similar to the rag <dig> recombinase  <cit> . pgbd5-induced genomic rearrangements in hprt <dig> did not appear to involve annotated human transposable elements , consistent with the absence of canonical piggybac-derived transposons within the human hprt <dig> gene  <cit> .table  <dig> lasv detects significantly more inactivating mutations in thioguanine-resistant cells

previously, we found that the genomic integration of transposons by pgbd <dig> required specific dna substrate sequences containing inverted terminal repeats with ggg terminal motifs  <cit> . we reasoned that potential human endogenous pgbd <dig> substrates in hprt <dig> may be identified by the presence of inverted terminal repeats at the sequences flanking the breakpoints of the observed structural variants . using this approach, we identified  <dig> terminal elements flanking the structural variant breakpoints in the pgbd5-expressing but not in the control gfp cells . the identified structural variant breakpoint sequences exhibited specific motifs in the pgbd <dig> but not in the control gfp cells , as assessed using sequence entropy analysis and implemented in the meme algorithm  <cit> . consistent with their thioguanine resistance selection,  <dig> out of  <dig> structural variants involving these sequence motifs were predicted to cause inactivation of hprt <dig> by causing exonic deletions, similar to prior studies of rag1-induced hprt <dig> inactivation  <cit> . we confirmed that the identified pgbd5-specific sequence motifs occur in the hprt <dig> gene at approximately the same frequency as the rest of the human genome, and therefore are not enriched in our assays simply because of their genomic distribution . while they differ in sequence from the canonical piggybac-derived inverted terminal repeats, pgbd5-specific sequence motifs in hprt <dig> are enriched for terminal ggg nucleotides and lack thymines , in agreement with the structural requirements observed in previous studies using synthetic transposon substrates  <cit> . while these sequences motifs may constitute specific pgbd <dig> signal sequences  that are associated with pgbd5-induced genomic rearrangements, it remains to be determined whether pgbd <dig> induces a similar variety of genomic rearrangements as part of its endogenous activities, or alternatively, whether it mediates true dna transposition with excision and insertion of specific pss-containing inverted terminal repeat mobile elements.fig.  <dig> pgbd5-associated hprt <dig> structural variants contain terminal signal sequences. a analysis of the sequences flanking structural variant breakpoints demonstrating association of specific signal sequence motifs in cells expressing gfp-pgbd <dig> , but not gfp control . x-axis denotes nucleotide sequence logo position, and y-axis denotes information content in bits. black arrowheads mark the location of the breakpoints. b breakpoint sequences of a representative structural variant  showing pss sequence at both breakpoints of a deletion

discussion
in all, our findings indicate that human pgbd <dig> can induce structural variation and genomic rearrangements of endogenous human hprt <dig> loci. the identification of potential pgbd <dig> signal sequences in human genomes using the hprt <dig> forward genetic screen represents a crucial first step in defining its endogenous genomic substrates in vertebrates and humans. consistent with the distinct evolutionary history and developmental neuronal expression of pgbd <dig>  identified pss motifs are distinct from the recombination signal sequences  described for rag <dig> in lymphocytes  <cit> . importantly, identified pss motifs exhibit only limited similarity to canonical piggybac transposons, namely preference for terminal ggg nucleotides, in support of the distinct phylogeny of pgbd <dig> as compared to other piggybac-derived genes in vertebrates  <cit> . since our analysis was limited to genomic rearrangements of human hprt <dig> in bj fibroblasts the presence of thioguanine selection, it is possible that pgbd <dig> may exhibit different sequence preferences and remodeling activities in neurons and diseased cells where it is endogenously expressed. our analysis did not identify bona fide ‘cut-and-paste’ dna transposition in hprt <dig>  and it remains to be determined whether pgbd <dig> catalyzes dna transposition of endogenous human mobile elements, or simply their nuclease-mediated dna rearrangements. the described pss motifs now provide essential templates for future functional studies of pgbd5-induced genomic remodeling.

CONCLUSIONS
recent discovery of active human thap <dig> and pgbd <dig> dna transposases, combined with the functional recombination activity of rag <dig>  suggests that other endogenous transposase-derived genes may catalyze as of yet unknown cell-specific somatic or germ-line rearrangements in vertebrates and humans. while their identification has been substantially empowered by whole-genome sequencing, determination of their functional activities has been hindered by the lack of knowledge of their endogenous substrate sequences. we expect that the integration of forward genetic screening with massively parallel dna sequencing, as we have done here, and structural variant genome analysis using methods such as crispresso/lasv should permit the determination of the genome remodeling activities of endogenous as well as engineered genome editing enzymes. while leveraging the advantages of negative and positive selection of hprt <dig> forward genetic screening for specificity, this approach additionally benefits from improved sensitivity, enabling the identification of both simple and complex structural variants at base-pair resolution. this is limited only by sequencing coverage, without the need for single cell cloning that may be compromised by cell fitness effects. finally, we anticipate that the reported pgbd <dig> signal sequences will lead to the elucidation of its function in health and disease.
