BACKGROUND
gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive disorder, is a common lysosomal storage disease. insufficient activity of acid β-glucosidase  in all cells leads to the substrate accumulation including glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, and the various clinical phenotypes. the pathologic hallmark of gaucher disease is the presence of lipid laden macrophages, a.k.a., gaucher cells, in visceral organs  <cit> . the macrophages are thought to be the primary visceral cells involved in all variants, and these cells become progressively numerous and engorged with glucosylceramide by phagocytic processes. by yet undefined mechanisms, this process leads to tissue dysfunction that can result in fibrosis and scarring during the later stages of the disease.

some of these tissue changes have been attributed to "activation" of the engorged macrophages with subsequent release of inflammatory agents. indeed, some gaucher disease patients had increased levels of pro-inflammatory  and anti-inflammatory cytokines  in serum and/or tissues  <cit> . tnfα production has been suggested as a response to glucosylceramide accumulation in gaucher disease patients  <cit> . serum levels of m-csf, scd <dig> , and il- <dig> can also be increased and correlations have been made with the severity of gaucher disease  <cit> . an in situ study of spleen from a gaucher disease patient showed increased expression of anti-inflammatory mediators in macrophages, including ccl <dig>  cd <dig>  chitotriosidase, il-1ra, and cd <dig>  <cit> . such anti-inflammatory mediators are considered markers of alternatively activated macrophages   <cit>  and implicate secreted cytokines as pathophysiological agents in gaucher disease. such studies also suggest a central role of glucosylceramide in altered macrophage function as an initiator of the disease pathogenesis.

how the insufficiency of gcase activity and the subsequent metabolic disturbances related to glucosylceramide and other sphingolipids  could lead to such inflammatory imbalances remains obscure. however, the consequent imbalances of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate in gaucher disease could affect immunologic responses, inflammation and cell proliferation  <cit> . these and other studies implicate profound systematic pathophysiological changes rather than simple lipid accumulation as the basis of the disease  <cit> . the pathologic manifestations of various organs suggest that the defective glucosylceramide hydrolysis and substrate accumulation in multiple organs affects numerous metabolic networks. consequently, systematic transcriptome analyses could provide useful insights into the resultant molecular events underlying gcase deficiency and glucosylceramide storage as well as related tissue pathogenesis in gaucher disease. in addition to visceral processes, some correlations of neuropathologic involvement with gene expression profiles in brains from neuronopathic gaucher disease patients or gba <dig> variant mice  <cit>  provide isolated cross-sectional views of the disease processes. however, they have not provided insight into the dynamic or sequential nature of such pathophysiological progression.

here, viable gba <dig> point-mutated mice, v394l/v394l  and d <dig> v/null , were used to explore the temporal and spatial profiles of tissue and gba <dig> mutation-related gene expression by genome-wide mrna microarrays and immunohistochemical analyses. particular focus was on macrophage activation  responses and ifnγ regulated pro-inflammatory or il- <dig> regulated anti-inflammatory networks. these studies established a starting point for understanding the basis of the progressive pathophysiology in gaucher disease at a molecular/tissue level.

RESULTS
phenotype of gba <dig> v394l homozygotes  and d <dig> v/null  mice
4l or  <dig> v/null mice appear phenotypically normal and have survived ~  <dig> years. all mice have grossly normal behavior, reproduce, and show no gross evidence of cns abnormalities. the residual gcase activity levels in visceral organs were 6-7% or 4-7% of wt in 4l or  <dig> v/null, respectively  <cit> . by lc-ms/ms analyses, accumulations of glucosylceramide were detected in  <dig> v/null lung and liver as early as at  <dig> wk , and then progressed up to 33-fold during  <dig> to  <dig> wk and >40-fold at  <dig> wk . in 4l mice, glucosylceramide levels in lung and liver were 2- to 3-fold increased at  <dig> or  <dig> wk, respectively . numerous large storage cells were observed in  <dig> v/null lungs  and to a lesser extent in liver at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> wk. such cells were much smaller and less numerous in 4l lungs . the macrophage nature of storage cells was evidenced by their cd <dig> and f4/ <dig> positivity .

differential gene expression in tissues from gaucher mice
the rna samples were from lungs and livers of  <dig> v/null and 4l mice at the ages of 4-, 12-, 18- and 28-wk. the probe sets for each gene in the mutant mice that showed significantly differential expression were compared with those from the strain background matched wt. in these mutant models, the altered probe signals ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> of the  <dig> total probes on the chip. for further analyses, the genes were assigned to the probe sets. at a false positive rate  of  <dig> , about  <dig> -4% of total genes were significantly differentially expressed:  <dig> or  <dig> genes in lung or liver, respectively, of  <dig> v/null mice;  <dig> or  <dig> genes were in lung or liver, respectively, of 4l mice . the differentially expressed genes in each tissue were segregated into  <dig> major functional groups with statistical significance across the two tissues in both mouse models to provide global profiles of gene expression. the functional categories include catalytic activity, cell death, cytoskeleton, immune response, intracellular signaling cascade, kinase activity, lipid metabolic process, lysosome, macrophage activation, response to stress, transcription, and transport . in lung, both mouse models showed similar spectra of gene expression patterns for these functional groups, except genes for immune response and macrophage activation that were more highly altered in  <dig> v/null mice. in  <dig> v/null and 4l livers, fewer functional groups  were significant in comparison with lung profiles . interestingly, genes for cell death did not reach significance in 4l liver, and genes for immune response were significant only in 9v/null lung . the macrophage activation genes were grouped as a functional category, because the macrophage is the hallmark of gaucher disease, and large numbers of storage cells  were observed in the lungs of 12-, 18-, and 28-wk old  <dig> v/null mice . the enrichment of differentially expressed gene categories was examined by comparing the percentage populating the various gene ontologies in these two mouse models across lung and liver from all time points. among these  <dig> different functional categories, the composition of macrophage activation genes in  <dig> v/null lung was 10% of the total altered genes, and 6% in 4l lung: these represent  <dig> -fold enrichment . to correlate the gene functional category with their expression profile in gba <dig> mutant mice, the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes in  <dig> v/null lung were analyzed by hierarchical clustering, and three clusters were revealed across all ages in the lung. cluster  <dig> showed  <dig> genes with low expression  in  <dig> v/null and 4l lung across the 4- to 28-wk age range when compared with the wt lung . these down-regulated genes were mainly in the functional categories of catalytic activity, cell death, intracellular signaling cascade, kinase activity, macrophage, and transcription . cluster  <dig> contained about 55% of genes  and showed differential degrees of up-regulation in the  <dig> v/null and 4l lung . cluster  <dig> showed 10% of genes  with high expression levels exclusively in  <dig> v/null lung . these same genes did not have distinct patterns in the  <dig> v/null liver or the 4l lung and liver data sets . two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analyses show mutation-type  and tissue type-related  global gene expression profiles. these highly expressed  <dig> unique genes in  <dig> v/null lung contained  <dig> that were macrophage activation genes. the others represented intracellular signaling , lipid metabolic process , catalytic activity , and transport  . these initial findings strongly indicated the involvement of macrophage activation genes in gaucher disease and led to the focus on the expression profiles of macrophage activation related genes in  <dig> v/null lung.

the functional categories with p-value <  <dig>  were considered significant by fisher exact test.

expression profile of macrophage activation genes
to explore the expression profile of macrophage activation, all  <dig> such genes  were analyzed. at early stages of the disease , 44% of these genes  were significantly altered with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated in the  <dig> v/null lung . as the disease progressed , 81%  of the macrophage activation genes were significantly and consistently up-regulated, and 15%  of these genes were down regulated in  <dig> v/null lung . the genes with expressions significantly changed at  <dig> or  <dig> time points from  <dig> to  <dig> wk were considered as consistently affected. similar expression profiles were defined in 4l lung where 88%  of such genes were altered at  <dig> wk with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. from  <dig> to  <dig> wk, 84%  of the macrophage activation genes were affected with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated. the mean fold-change of these consistently up-regulated macrophage activation genes was > <dig> -fold in  <dig> v/null lung and liver, whereas a  <dig> -fold change was observed in the corresponding 4l tissues .

using the ingenuity analysis system and additional literature sources  <cit> ,  <dig> ifnγ-regulated pro-inflammatory and  <dig> il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory genes were significantly expressed  from  <dig> to  <dig> wk  in  <dig> v/null lungs with  <dig> pro-inflammatory genes significantly altered beginning at  <dig> wk . most of these genes were cytokines/chemokines or their receptors, including ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  other genes included cd <dig>  and the macrophage scavenger receptor  <dig> . several pro-inflammatory genes  did not meet the statistical significance . to evaluate these genes, immunohistochemical analyses were conducted and the lipid-laden macrophages showed antibody positive signals . the results show high expression of these four cytokine proteins in macrophages even though their respective rna levels were relatively unchanged. additional immunohistochemical analyses showed consistent positivity with antibodies to ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl9; this was concordant with their rna expression. similar mrna analyses showed that 6% of altered genes were in the macrophage activation category in  <dig> v/null liver or 4l lung and liver. however, none were pro-inflammatory genes . these data support disease progression and tissue-type related profiles of pro-inflammatory gene expression in gaucher disease.

note: the gene symbols in bold were not significantly expressed in microarray analysis, but were positive on immunohistochemstry in  <dig> v/null lung. the numbers show fold change in gene expression. the numbers in bold were significantly affected and satisfied with fdr  and fold change at ≥ ±  <dig> . genes with * sign were positive on immunohistochemistry. wk = week.

in the il- <dig> regulated pathway,  <dig> anti-inflammatory genes were up regulated in  <dig> v/null lung . two genes  were up regulated by  <dig> wk and then continuously up regulated at  <dig> to  <dig> wk. the other seven anti-inflammatory genes were unchanged at  <dig> wk. these less significant changes in the anti-inflammatory genes at the age of 4-wk reflect the underdevelopment of alternatively activated macrophage features. with age , all anti-inflammatory genes were consistently up regulated including the nos <dig> counteracting enzyme arginase type ii , cytokine/chemokine ccl17/ccl <dig>  immunoglobulin heavy chain  <dig> , il- <dig> receptor antagonist , and matrix metallopeptidase mmp9/12/ <dig> . among these genes, mmp <dig> expression was exceptionally high . mmp- <dig>  macrophage elastase, functions to degrade extracellular matrix components, e.g., elastin, and is involved in acute and chronic pulmonary inflammatory diseases associated with an intense airway remodeling  <cit> . the anti-inflammatory genes, e.g., il- <dig>  and the macrophage scavenger receptor cd <dig> did not meet statistical significance, but were positive by immunohistochemistry. with  <dig> v/null liver mrna, only three anti-inflammatory genes  were consistently up regulated  indicating differential effects on the il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory pathway genes in lung and liver. in  <dig> v/null lung, these data show that the il- <dig> regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators were also temporally and spatially altered and they were expressed in parallel with coordinate pro-inflammatory genes with disease progression.

the pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression patterns were analyzed in the more attenuated 4l model. in 4l lung, the percentage of altered macrophage activation genes was ~50% of that in  <dig> v/null lungs . no pro-inflammatory genes were altered in 4l lungs during disease progression , and the immunohistochemistry as well as routine histology were identical to wt. only three anti-inflammatory genes  were consistently  up regulated in 4l lung. the expression patterns of anti-inflammatory genes in liver of 4l mice were similar to those in the  <dig> v/null mice. there were no pro-inflammatory genes significantly altered and only the anti-inflammatory genes, igh- <dig>  il-1rn, or mmp <dig>  were consistently up regulated in  <dig> v/null and 4l liver . in summary, the median expression values of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes in  <dig> v/null lung were 2-fold higher than that in  <dig> v/null liver and 4l tissues . these data demonstrate the differential rna expression of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators and their correlation with type of mutations and tissues, and disease progression. the results also indicate a differential molecular pathophysiology in  <dig> v/null or 4l gaucher disease mice that is likely related to the degree of storage cell infiltration and accumulation of glucosylceramide.

commonality of significantly expressed genes involved in macrophage activation
to explore the commonality of affected global or macrophage activation genes between two tissues in gba <dig> variant mice, comparative analyses were displayed as venn diagrams. more than 50% of the altered genes globally in lung or liver were concordantly and significantly expressed in  <dig> v/null and 4l mice . these common genes were distributed in all  <dig> functional categories. similar results were obtained by commonality analysis of significantly expressed macrophage activation genes between tissues of both gba <dig> mutant models. as shown, ~50% of macrophage activation genes in lung or liver of 9v/null mice were similarly affected in 4l mice . the intersection of macrophage activation genes in lung or liver from  <dig> v/null and 4l mice includes pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, cytokine receptors, growth factors, and mhc ii molecules . all the matched macrophage activation genes in the intersection were concordantly up or down regulated in both lung and liver of  <dig> v/null and 4l mice. these data suggest a common basic pathway of macrophage activation genes in multiple tissues of gba <dig> mutated mice. in the lung of the  <dig> v/null and 4l models, all genes for antigen processing related to mhc ii and some complement components were up-regulated . the effect of mhc on cytokine production has been shown to be particularly important in resistance of mice to intracellular pathogens  <cit> . these data imply that gcase deficiency and resultant substrate accumulation stimulated multiple immune response genes. the above analyses demonstrate that substantial numbers of macrophage activation genes were significantly affected in gba <dig> variant mice, most of them were up-regulated and concordant with the disease progression from  <dig> to  <dig> wk, many were shared among tissues, but some were more tissue specific. although the molecular cascades in macrophage activation are not yet known, the tissue-/mutation-type and disease progress correlated profiles of macrophage activation-related genes suggest common temporally and spatially regulated mechanisms in the pathophysiology of gaucher disease. the expression profiles of these genes also indicated macrophage activation in gba <dig> variant mice with significant heterogeneity between the tissues and mutation types.

effects of genetic background on mrna profiles
the genetic backgrounds of  <dig> v/null  and 4l  were slightly different, since the  <dig> v/null was generated by crosses of  <dig> v/ <dig> v  with null/wt  mice. to validate the macrophage gene expression profile and evaluate effects of the fvb strain on gene expression, fvb wt data sets  were run using the same methods and standards. a total of  <dig> chip sets  were loaded into partek genomics suite  <dig> , and the data were normalized and analyzed . fdr was set at  <dig>  and fold change was set at ± <dig>  for significance.

the numbers of significantly expressed genes in  <dig> v/null lung based upon the wt controls from these two different genetic backgrounds are as follows. with the fvb wt as control data set,  <dig> genes with significantly altered expression were selected. among them, 10%  were macrophage activation genes and  <dig> %  were pro-/anti-inflammatory genes . the commonality of macrophage genes selected based upon different genetic background was also analyzed. among  <dig> macrophage genes , 52%  were the same as with genetic matched controls . also, 83% of infγ/il- <dig> regulated pathway genes were shown to have similar gene expression profiles using either of the two genetic backgrounds. although some variation exists in the selected genes and their expression significance, the macrophage activation genes, including infγ and il- <dig> pathway genes, were identified as a major functional group using either strains.

validation of selected mrna expression
the genes identified by microarray analyses were selectively validated by real-time rt-pcr of the same pooled rna as used for chip analyses. primer sets for ccl <dig>  msr <dig>  ccl <dig>  and mmp <dig> were used in duplicate assays and β-actin rna was used as an internal control. the results show similar patterns of cytokine gene expression to those obtained by chip analyses. the fold-change values obtained with real-time rt-pcr were 2- to 4-fold higher than those from chip analyses . this reflects inherent differences of the two methods.

immunohistochemical studies of the macrophage activation related genes
histological and immunohistochemical studies were conducted with lung and liver sections from  <dig> v/null and 4l mice to correlate gene expression patterns with protein levels. as shown, numerous large storage cells were observed in  <dig> v/null lung with positivity for the surface antigens, cd <dig> and f4/ <dig> . cd <dig> rna also was elevated in lungs  and livers  of  <dig> v/null mice at  <dig> to  <dig> wk, but they had no significant alteration in 4l lung and liver . this result would be expected because of the large number of storage cells in the lungs of  <dig> v/null mice. immunohistochemical staining with cd <dig> antibody showed high intensity cd68-positive storage cells in the lung  and liver . cd68-positive cells were quantified and showed  <dig> and  <dig> per  <dig> representative fields  in the lung from two  <dig> v/null mice. a few small sized cd68-positive cells were observed in wt lung at  <dig> wk . in 4l lungs, multiple  small cd68-positive macrophages were present at  <dig> wk . f4/ <dig>  rna signals were within ± <dig> -fold range in all  <dig> v/null and 4l tissues. by immunohistochemistry, f4/ <dig> positive macrophages were  <dig> and  <dig> per  <dig> fields  in the lung of two  <dig> v/null mice. the qualitative staining intensity of f4/80-positive storage cells was weak to medium compared to that of cd <dig> positive cells in lung of  <dig> v/null mice .

macrophage activation in 4l and  <dig> v/null mice was evaluated using antibodies to cytokines corresponding to genes with differential rna expression. antibodies to pro-inflammatory cytokines infγ, il- <dig>  nos <dig> , ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> , and tnfα  stained storage cells intensely in lungs from  <dig> v/null mice and were quantified microscopically . some nos <dig> positive cells were present in 4l lungs, but the antibodies to the other cytokines were negative . the rna expression level of infγ, il- <dig>  nos <dig> and tnfα in  <dig> v/null lungs did not satisfy the fdr ≤  <dig> , but the respective proteins could be detected by immunohistochemistry at  <dig> to  <dig> wk. by dual immunofluorescence staining, many tnfα signals co-localized with cd <dig> signals in  <dig> v/null lung; the tnfα intensity was relatively weak compared with cd <dig> signal . tnfα signals in 4l lung at  <dig> and  <dig> wk were also positive, but with lower intensities and in fewer cells compared with those in  <dig> v/null lung at  <dig> wk .

in  <dig> v/null lungs, positive signals were also evident for the anti-inflammatory cytokines, il- <dig>  mmp <dig>  and arg <dig> , and cd <dig> . as with some pro-inflammatory genes, the rna expression of il- <dig> or cd <dig> genes in  <dig> v/null lungs did not satisfy the fdr  <dig> , but their protein levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence staining at  <dig> to  <dig> wk. the signals of il- <dig> positive macrophages were relatively weak in lung of  <dig> v/null at  <dig> wk, and no signals were detected in wt and 4l lung . the staining intensity with arg <dig> and mmp <dig> antibody was at intermediate levels in  <dig> v/null lung at  <dig> wk . arg <dig> positive cells also were observed in the lung of 4l mice at  <dig> wk. cd <dig> signals were significant in lung of  <dig> v/null mice compared with the signals in wt and 4l tissues , and these mostly co-localized with cd <dig> signals. in 4l mouse lung, the macrophages were small. the antibody positive macrophages for ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  nos <dig>  il- <dig>  or mmp <dig> were quantified as above and showed  <dig> to  <dig> per  <dig> fields in  <dig> v/null lung ; infγ or arg <dig> antibody positive cells numbered  <dig> or  <dig> per  <dig> fields. the intensity of each antibody staining at  <dig> to  <dig> wk showed a concordant pattern with the rna expression profile. these studies show differential expression of macrophage activation related genes in the various mice with gba <dig> mutations that were nearly cell specific.

ifnγ and il- <dig> regulated pathways and gene expression networks
pathwayarchitect  <dig> . <dig>  and ingenuity pathways analysis  were conducted to summarize the potential interactions of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators based on the rna microarray data and immunohistochemical data . nine of  <dig> macrophage pro-inflammatory genes were significantly affected at  <dig> wk . beginning at  <dig> wk, all  <dig> pro-inflammatory genes were significantly up regulated at the rna or protein levels, and then remained at up-regulation until  <dig> wk . most of anti-inflammatory genes in the  <dig> v/null lung were not changed at  <dig> wk , but were at  <dig> to  <dig> wk . interestingly, the up-regulation of il- <dig> was only detected at  <dig> wk. this pro- or anti-inflammatory pathway model summarizes a significant coordination and interaction of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines/mediators in the disease process.

a potential global gene expression network and a cascade regulation initiated by macrophage activation genes were evaluated using pathwayarchitect  <dig> . <dig> and ingenuity pathways analysis programs. a total  <dig> significantly expressed genes in  <dig> v/null and  <dig> genes in 4l lungs were connected in the ifnγ- or il-4-regulated pro-/anti-inflammatory pathway . this network was built with a high confidence index of direct and indirect interactions. in this cascade network, ifnγ- and il-4-regulated pro-/anti-inflammatory genes as core genes  connected with many different functional pathways through key genes. these key genes are significantly connected to the next group genes in the cascade of network   <cit> . the included main gene groups in each cascade regulation were for transcription , kinase activity , cell death , and signal transduction  .

discussion
the genome-wide transcriptome data presented here demonstrate genotype and tissue-type related gene expression patterns in  <dig> v/null and 4l mice that are analogues of human gaucher disease. interestingly, the percentage of functional categories containing dysregulated rnas was similar across all  <dig> v/null or 4l tissues, except for the macrophage activation genes that showed ~2-fold enrichment in  <dig> v/null lung, the most extensively involved organ . another identified group was that for immune response genes, which were altered only in  <dig> v/null lung. among the  <dig> immune response genes,  <dig> overlapped with the macrophage group. since histological analyses did not find obvious t-cell and b-cell infiltration in  <dig> v/null lung, these immune responses likely emanated from macrophages. macrophage activation in  <dig> v/null lung was also supported by hierarchical clustering analysis in which the  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig>  were exclusively expressed in  <dig> v/null, rather than in 4l lung; a third of these were macrophage activation genes . these results indicate significant involvement of macrophage activation genes in  <dig> v/null lung, which was concordant with the extensive macrophage infiltration in the lungs. moreover, the complementary histopathological studies showed that the nature of macrophage activation was not uniform between tissues or within macrophages in a specific tissue. these data support the concept of a variety of dysregulated macrophages that are tissue and disease state dependent as a dynamic component of the gaucher disease/glucosylceramide storage pathophysiology.

engorged macrophages are a hallmark of gaucher disease, and these cells were differentially activated in tissues of  <dig> v/null and 4l mice at the mrna, cellular, and immunohistochemical levels. the progressively increasing sizes and numbers of macrophages in visceral organs of gba <dig> variant mice, because of the lipid storage, was particularly evident in lungs of  <dig> v/null mice from  <dig> to  <dig> wk . immunohistochemistry with the antibodies to selected ifnγ-regulated pro-inflammatory and il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines showed that these cytokines were expressed in lung macrophages, but not in lung epithelial cells, i.e., there were pro- and anti-inflammatory responses  of the lipid-laden macrophage. also, such analyses showed significant expression of the ifnγ protein in lung macrophages of  <dig> v/null mice at  <dig> and  <dig> wk , but lesser expression in liver. these expression patterns were concordant with the differential activation of macrophages in these tissues as was evident by both microarray and morphologic data. in addition, ifnγ and its regulated pathway genes were less aberrant in tissues of the 4l mice, a more attenuated model, as ascertained by rna or protein analyses. these results implicate pro-inflammation as a primary pathophysiological mechanism in gaucher disease, as well as the degree of alterations in this pathway in the severity of gaucher disease involvement. the production and secretion of cytokines from storage macrophages can be the important factors for the extracellular matrix components and function as they influence the interaction of surrounding macrophages with phagocytotic or endocytotic ligands and propagate the pathophysiology  <cit> .

ifnγ is a potent activator of macrophages and induces the expression of > <dig> genes, including those in the inflammatory mediator/chemokine pathway  <cit> . also, activated macrophages can be a significant source of ifnγ  <cit> . importantly, ifnγ inhibits macrophage proliferation and protects them from apoptosis  <cit> , thereby prolonging their survival within inflammatory loci  <cit> . here, the rna expression levels of ifnγ, il- <dig>  nos <dig>  and tnfα were not significantly increased , but their protein levels were specifically and highly expressed in the large lung macrophages. this observation indicates that the expression of these proteins and rnas could be missed in whole tissue homogenates in which there may be large dilutional effects, if expression is restricted to specific cell types that make up a small percentage of total cells, e.g., macrophages. importantly,  <dig> other cytokines are in the ifnγ pathway and could be downstream modulated by this cytokine. for example, ifnγ can induce tnfα and nos <dig>  and has differential effects on several individual chemokine genes  <cit>  that provide for selective stimulus sensitivity in mediating restricted pattern of chemokine gene expression. transcripts for cxcl1/ <dig> and the ccl chemokines  can be enhanced by th1-related inflammatory mediators including ifnγ, il- <dig>  tnfα, or lps  <cit>  as well as modulating the effects of each other . the outcomes of such interactions lead to a cascading cytokine pro-inflammatory dysregulation that propagates gaucher disease. indeed, tnfα is a major regulator of chemokine gene expression, e.g., cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . the finding here that tnfα protein was up regulated  implicates its downstream cytokine network during gaucher disease progression. also, cytokines, e.g., ccl <dig>  act synergistically with other macrophage chemokines  <cit>  to maintain the pro-inflammatory reactions.

pro-inflammatory cytokines play a critical role in macrophage/leukocyte recruitment and adhesion  <cit>  and they recruit new macrophages to involved tissues via this cytokine network. under the stimulus of accumulating glucosylceramide and other glucolipids, such a positive feedback macrophage-cytokine-macrophage cycle can be envisioned to expand and promote progression and the recruitment of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines/mediators networks . the progressive cascade is schematically shown in figure  <dig> in which numerous interacting cytokines and chemokines are progressively up-regulated during disease progression from  <dig> to  <dig> wk. ifnγ central to this cascading network with initial mrna up-regulation of β- and α-chemokines, as well as mrs <dig> , tnfα, and nos <dig>  among these interacting factors is the pleiotropic cytokine il- <dig>  which is a systemic alarm for tissue damage  <cit> . the β-chemokines, ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and the α-chemokines, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  mediate pro-inflammatory effects in the various types of cells and also have synergetic effects on their targets  <cit> . the macrophage scavenger receptor  <dig>  has been implicated in many macrophage-associated physiological and pathological processes through endocytosis  <cit> . nos <dig> and arginase were up-regulated at the rna and protein levels in the  <dig> v/null mice, and as has been observed in ex vivo studies  <cit> . nos <dig> produces nitric oxide from arginine and stimulates pro-inflammation  <cit> . nos <dig> production in macrophages up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor  production and activates angiogenic activity  <cit> . in comparison, arginase <dig> is a negative angiogenic regulator that inhibits nos <dig> activity  <cit> . thus, arginase <dig> and nos <dig> alternative pathways in activated macrophages  <cit>  and their up-regulation in  <dig> v/null mice simultaneous pro- and anti-inflammatory networks are being activated in the gaucher disease process.

interrogation of the il- <dig> mediated anti-inflammatory network highlights significantly differential expression of  <dig> anti-inflammatory genes, indicating that participation of the aamφ il- <dig> pathway that counteract expression of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines and induce molecules that facilitate tolerance, healing and expression of innate immunity receptors, e.g. the scavenger receptor, cd <dig>  <cit> . the il- <dig> pathway  displays the il- <dig> time course and interactions over the  <dig> to  <dig> wk period. after an initial lag period from  <dig> to  <dig> wk, a network of such th <dig> response genes  <cit>  is up-regulated at the rna and/or protein levels. this network includes the structurally and functionally related matrix metalloproteinases mmp9/12/ <dig> that are endopeptidases important to remodeling processes  <cit> . these mmps are among the most highly-expressed genes in most  <dig> v/null tissues. the high level expression of mmps correlated with chronic fibrotic processes in  <dig> v/null lung and liver . mmp <dig> expression occurs in human alveolar macrophages  <cit>  and airway smooth muscle cells  <cit> , and in murine alveolar type ii epithelial cells  <cit>  or primary lung fibroblasts  <cit> . the immunohistochemistry showed very strong signals in the lipid-laden macrophages, and much weaker signals in other lung cells . the extremely high level of mmp <dig> expression  implicates the aamφ in gaucher disease progression.

the aamφs are also implicated in the disease progression in  <dig> v/null mice as evidenced by cd <dig> expression  <cit>  and, particularly, expression of the il- <dig> receptor antagonist . il-1rn inhibits the activities of il-1a and il-1b, and modulates il- <dig> related immune and inflammatory responses. il-1rn is typically produced by aamφ and regulated by il- <dig>  <cit> . the interactions of these anti-inflammatory cytokines are schematically shown in figure  <dig> and indicate an overall description of pro-/anti-inflammatory networks in gba <dig> mutant mice.

the global gene expression networks integrate the gene expression patterns observed in  <dig> v/null or 4l mice. in these networks, more than 1/ <dig> of significantly expressed genes were connected through the cascade interactions of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes. although the macrophage involvement is major histopathological finding, about 3% of the genome was significantly altered at a molecular level during the development of the disease process. the propagation of the disease clearly depends on a generalized pro- and anti-inflammatory disruption.

macrophages display marked phenotype heterogeneity in vitro and in vivo, including the responsiveness to endogenous and exogenous stimuli  <cit> . such heterogeneity results in differential phagocytosis or endocytosis, intracellular signaling and gene activation or repression  <cit> . macrophage heterogeneity was observed in the  <dig> v/null and 4l models by their differential activation and tissue distribution. large lipid-laden macrophages  were mostly observed in the lung of  <dig> v/null mice. quantitative immunohistochemistry showed only some cytokines/effectors  were present in ~50% of lung macrophages . however, ifnγ and arg <dig> were present in nearly all of such macrophages. the corresponding rnas of the cytokine/effectors were also up regulated. the basis for this heterogeneous expression of cytokine proteins in macrophages is unknown, but may be due to the different origins, differentiation sates, or maturation of the macrophage populations.

the genetic background of mice can influence gene expression profiles. interstrain variations  of gene expression profiles have been shown in different brain regions of mouse inbred strains  <cit> . for example, such variation can be observed in the differential susceptibility to a wide range of pathogens  <cit> . here,  <dig> v/null and 4l mice had mixed strain backgrounds from three in-bred mouse strains fvb and/or c57bl/6j-129sv. to evaluate the potential effects of mouse strain background on the expression profiles of macrophage activation genes, the wt data sets from fvb and three inbred mixed strains were used in the analyses. the result showed >50% of significantly expressed macrophage activation genes were shared when either of the two background controls were used. there was 83% concordance in the infγ- and il-4- regulated pathway genes. in addition, comparative analyses were conducted with duplicate lung rna chip data from wt adult mice of three different genetic backgrounds . the combined wt data generated  <dig> significantly expressed genes in  <dig> v/null lung . about 60% of significantly expressed macrophage genes were concordant between fvb only or strain-matched wt controls, including >90% of infγ-/il4-regulated pathway genes . the results showed general agreement of the gene expression profiles from individual wt backgrounds with those from wt controls either pure fvb or strain-matched backgrounds. the results show that macrophage activation genes are a significant functional group in the propagation of gaucher disease in several genetic backgrounds.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated direct relationships between the degree of tissue glucosylceramides and the gene expression profile alterations. these analyses implicate ifnγ-regulated pro-inflammatory and il-4-regulated anti-inflammatory networks in differential disease progression with implications for understanding the gaucher disease course and pathophysiology.
