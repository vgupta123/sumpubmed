BACKGROUND
mycoplasma synoviae is an economically important pathogen of poultry, causing synovitis, chronic respiratory tract disease, and retarded growth in chickens and turkeys  <cit> . m. synoviae is a member of the genus mycoplasma of the class mollicutes, a group of wall-less gram-positive bacteria with genomes ranging from  <dig> kb to as little as  <dig> kb  <cit> . the genome sequence of m. synoviae strain wvu  <dig> has been determined and comparative analysis with m. gallisepticum, another major avian pathogen, provided evidence for horizontal gene transfer between the two species, though belonging to two distinct phylogenetic groups  <cit> . among the genes that could have arisen by horizontal gene transfer are those encoding for haemagglutinins. in avian mycoplasmas, genes encoding for these immunogenic and surface exposed proteins are the subject of considerable antigenic variability  <cit> . by alternating the composition of their surface proteins, mycoplasmas are thought to colonize more efficiently mucosal surfaces and become more virulent  <cit> . haemagglutinins account among the most important surface proteins involved in colonization and virulence of avian mycoplasmas  <cit> .

in m. synoviae, haemagglutinins are encoded by related sequences of a multigene family referred to as vlha genes  <cit> . the haemagglutinins of m. gallisepticum  and m. imitans are also encoded by multigene families related to vlha  <cit> . both organization and control of expression of vlha genes are quite different between m. gallisepticum and m. synoviae. in the former species, vlha genes are located in five distinct genomic regions and each gene appears to be translationally competent  <cit> . by contrast, in m. synoviae, all vlha sequences are confined to a restricted genomic region with a unique copy being expressed in a single strain  <cit> 

the uniquely expressed vlha gene of m. synoviae yields a product that is cleaved post-translationally into a n-terminal lipoprotein  and a c-terminal haemagglutinin protein   <cit> . cleavage was found to occur immediately after amino acid residue  <dig>  <cit> . both mspa and mspb are surface-exposed proteins and exhibit high frequency antigenic variation, but only mspa mediates binding to erythrocytes  <cit> . sequence analysis of several m. synoviae strains suggested that mspa was more antigenically variable than mspb  <cit> . consistently, in isogenically derived m. synoviae clones that have lost their haemadsorbing and/or haemagglutinating activity, mspa was no more detectable by polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies, suggesting extensive antigenic variation  <cit> .

the molecular basis underlying the generation of antigenic variants of m. synoviae vlha genes has been elegantly demonstrated in a study conducted by noormohammedi et al.  <dig>  <cit> . it resides in the ability of a single strain to undergo high frequency site-specific recombination, owing to the availability in the genome sequence of a significant pool of pseudogenes . recombination between the single complete vlha gene and one of the multiple pseudogene copies ensures the creation of a new vlha gene variant. to date, three expressed vlha gene variants  have been characterized in m. synoviae strain wvu  <dig>  <cit> . these genes are equally sized and show extensive sequence variability in a 400-bp dna segment in the middle of the vlha sequence, suggesting that the recombination event, though introduced sequence variations, tended to preserve the overall sequence length and composition. although it has been concluded that the potential of vlha genes to vary is considerable, there is no indication as to which extent a vlha gene could diverge without losing its properties.

previous studies from our laboratory have identified in m. synoviae strain wvu  <dig>  an immunodominant vlha variant   <cit>  whose haemagglutinin region displayed a dramatic sequence shift and was considerably reduced in size, relative to the previously characterized expressed vlha genes   <cit> . to better evaluate the extent of antigenic variation that could be tolerated by the m. synoviae haemagglutinin, we sought to know whether this highly divergent vlha member was properly processed and whether it remained functionally competent. our results provide evidence that the antigenic repertoire of m. synoviae vlha genes might be wider than previously perceived.

RESULTS
isolation of the ms2/ <dig>  fragment
the complete nucleotide sequence of ms2/ <dig>  the λ phage-derived dna fragment  harbouring the immuno-reactive ms2/ <dig>  sequence, has been previously described  <cit> . it is  <dig> bp long and contained two partial orfs, referred herein to as, ms2/ <dig>   and ms2/ <dig>   . ms2/ <dig>  lacked its n-terminal sequence, whereas the c-terminal region of ms2/ <dig>  was incomplete. the two partial orfs shared 71% and  <dig> % identity at the nucleotide and deduced amino acids sequences, respectively, and were separated by a 481-nucleotide non coding region . amino acid sequence comparisons between the two partial orfs and the expressed vlha <dig> gene have been previously described  <cit> . ms2/ <dig>  displayed  <dig> % identity with vlha <dig>  along a 244-residue overlapping region, while ms2/ <dig>  showed  <dig> % identity through a 495-amino acid overlapping sequence, starting at residue  <dig> of the vlha <dig> gene sequence. thus, the two partial open reading frames ms2/ <dig>  and ms2/ <dig>  are members of the vlha gene family.

evidence that ms2/ <dig>  was transcribed through the unique vlha promoter
immunoreactivity of the λ phage ms2/ <dig> clone was associated with the 5' end of the ms2/ <dig>  partial orf. with regard to the vlha <dig> sequence, the ms2/ <dig>  expressed region corresponded to the mspa  sequence extending from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  located immediately after the cleavage site.

given the strong immuno-reactivity of the ms2/ <dig>  encoded product, we hypothesised that it might be expressed in the bacterium as a vlha variant. indeed, it has been well established that in m. synoviae, strain wvu  <dig>  there exist only a single copy of the vlha promoter. new variant sequences, recruited from a pool of vlha pseudogenes, are placed under the control of this unique promoter via site-specific recombination  <cit> . hence, we performed rt-pcr using a sense primer targeting the 5'-end of the expected vlha promoter-derived transcript coupled to a reverse primer located at the 3' end of ms2/ <dig>  partial coding sequence. as shown in figure  <dig>  rt-pcr reaction yielded a dna fragment around  <dig>  kb that could not be amplified when pcr was attempted without rt reaction. this result provides evidence that ms2/ <dig>  was transcribed as a vlha variant.

analysis of ms2/ <dig>  cdna sequence
to further confirm the authenticity of the rt-pcr product and to complete the full-length coding sequence of the ms2/ <dig> , we subjected the rt-pcr product to nucleotide sequence analysis. as expected, the 5'-end region preceding the atg initiation codon was identical to that reported for the previously reported vlha expressed genes  <cit> . the ms2/ <dig>  full-length orf consisted of  <dig> nucleotides . the deduced 604-amino acid sequence is predicted to encode a protein with an expected molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. sequence alignments with vlha <dig> , as well as with the two full-length pseudogenes vlha <dig> and vlha <dig>   <cit>  , showed a perfect identity along the  <dig> 5'-end first nucleotides, corresponding to the n-terminal first  <dig> amino acids. downstream from this region, a very high divergence was observed with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % aa identity, respectively. likewise, in this region, ms2/ <dig>  shared only  <dig> % and  <dig> % identity, respectively, with the two vlha <dig> expressed variants, vlha <dig> and vlha <dig>  previously identified in m. synoviae strain wvu  <dig> . overall, the haemagglutinin region of ms2/ <dig>  was found to be considerably reduced in size  and displayed high level of sequence divergence in comparison to the previously reported vlha expressed genes, namely vlha <dig>  vlha <dig> , and vlha <dig>   <cit> .

demonstration that ms2/ <dig>  sequence is preceded by the vlha <dig> promoter
to confirm that in our bacterial stock ms2/ <dig>  was located downstream of the unique vlha promoter sequence, we performed pcr amplifications on single colonies using oligonucleotide primers placed in the vlha promoter sequence with either vlha1- or ms2/ <dig> -specific reverse primers. as shown in figure  <dig>  amplicons migrating at the expected mobility were obtained solely with ms2/ <dig> -specific reverse primers. sequence analysis further confirmed that the upstream sequence is identical to that of the vlha <dig> promoter, a result consistent with the finding that ms2/ <dig>  is transcriptionally active and that, in its transcript, the region preceding its atg initiation codon was identical to that reported for vlha <dig> 

ms2/ <dig>  encoded full-length product is post-translationally cleaved with its c-terminal portion exposed at the bacterium's surface
to characterize ms2/ <dig>  encoded product and to examine whether it was processed similarly as the vlha <dig> product, we generated antisera towards four bacterially expressed distinct regions of the coding sequence. the reactivity of these antisera is shown in figure  <dig>  the antiserum raised against the n-terminal  <dig> residues , which represent the vlha <dig> mspb protein, recognized three main protein bands : a diffuse  <dig> to  <dig> kda band similar to the previously described mspc <dig>  <cit> , a second diffuse band migrating at the range of  <dig> to  <dig> kda, typical to the previously described mspb <dig> and mspb <dig> proteins, and a third less intense, high molecular mass protein of  <dig> kda, consistent with the uncleaved vlha <dig> gene product. all these protein bands were revealed by the rabbit polyclonal anti-m. synoviae serum  located immediately upstream of the putative cleavage site reacted essentially with a non diffuse single band of  <dig> kda , identical to the vlha <dig> mspb protein. thus, ms2/ <dig>  product was properly cleaved. this was expected because, although ms2/ <dig>  diverged significantly from vlha <dig>  the sequence environment of the putative cleavage site was conserved along a 17-amino acid stretch . the monospecific antiserum to the highly reactive domain, located immediately downstream to the cleavage site , reacted with only a doublet of  <dig> and  <dig> kda , similar to the two different sized bands previously described as size variants of the vlha <dig> mspa protein  <cit> . finally, the antiserum directed against the c-terminal portion of ms2/ <dig>   failed to recognize a distinguishable protein band . by contrast, this antiserum strongly reacted in filter colony immunoblotting assay , suggesting that this c-terminal region of ms2/ <dig>  protein is exposed at the cell surface.

the c-terminal highly divergent region of ms2/ <dig>  encoded product was haemagglutination competent
mycoplasma synoviae strain wvu  <dig> antigen prepared from a single colony culture with an equivalent titer of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml showed haemagglutination of chicken red blood cells at a high dilution of 1: <dig>  corresponding to a titer of  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/ml. in addition, uniform hemadsorption of chicken erythrocytes to ms2/ <dig>  expressing colonies was demonstrated . strikingly, the e. coli-expressed c-terminal  <dig> residues of ms2/ <dig>  showed an haemagglutination activity. consistently, the antiserum raised against this c-terminal highly diverged region inhibited  chicken erythrocytes haemagglutination. collectively, these data demonstrate that the haemagglutinating activity of the vlha variant ms2/ <dig>  maps to its surface-exposed and highly divergent c-terminal  <dig> residues.

discussion
the molecular basis underlying the antigenic variability of m. synoviae vlha protein, the abundant immunodominant surface haemagglutinin, has been attributed to site-specific recombination, where recruited vlha pseudogene copies fuse with the unique expressed vlha gene sequence  <cit> . such a gene replacement mechanism, also known as gene conversion, allows a single strain of m. synoviae to generate a large number of variants by recruiting new sequences from a large pseudogene reservoir. this pseudogene reservoir was found to be confined to a restricted region of the genome  <cit> , providing an optimal environment for site-specific recombination. the finding that ms2/ <dig>  gene sequence occurs in tandem with another vlha related gene , suggests that it is part of this pseudogene reservoir.

overall, the data point to the selection and clonal expansion of a wvu  <dig> bacterial cell expressing a variant vlha gene with an exceptionally highly divergent haemagglutinin region, comparatively to the expressed vlha variant sequences described to date  <cit> . indeed, all tested colonies contained an ms2/ <dig>  sequence located immediately downstream of the unique vlha <dig> promoter. comparative sequence analyses with the previously full-length vlha genes, suggest that gene replacement could have occurred from aa residue  <dig> to the carboxy terminus. this finding adds a new 5' recombination site to the previously identified three sites   <cit> , thus increasing the potential to generate antigenic variability.

selection of clones expressing other vlha1-related genes from a culture of m. synoviae wvu  <dig>  led to the identification of two variant clones, referred to as vlha <dig> and vlha <dig>  <cit> . these expressed variants showed a predicted protein length close to that of vlha <dig> and diverged in their amino acid sequence by only 15% and 25%, respectively, from residue  <dig> to the carboxy terminus. this limited sequence variability most likely allows maintaining proper vlha processing, subcellular location, and haemagglutination activity, while providing sufficient antigenic variability. by contrast, the coding sequence of the full-length ms2/ <dig>  orf is considerably shorter than vlha <dig>  from which it diverged by 64%. the results showed that this highly variant sequence was properly processed, with its c-terminal highly divergent region exposed at the cell surface. in addition, the m. synoviae clone expressing ms2/ <dig>  efficiently haemagglutinated chicken erythrocytes, a property that was mapped to the surface-exposed and highly divergent c-terminal  <dig> residues of ms2/ <dig> . as far as could be ascertained, this is the first report mapping the heamagglutinating activity of a m. synoviae vlha gene. the finding that the antiserum raised against this c-terminal region inhibited the haemagglutinating activity of the homologous m. synoviae culture, definitely confirmed that the surface exposed c-terminal  <dig> residues of ms2/ <dig>  is associated with haemagglutination. it remains to be seen whether other regions of ms2/ <dig>  contribute to haemagglutination.

the results described above highlight the extent to which vlha genes could vary, in both the size and the sequence composition, without compromising their haemagglutination activity. hence, comparing the expressed sequences from several naturally evolved haemagglutinin variant clones may help identifying critical residues involved in the haemagglutinating activity of vlha. these variations would enable the bacterium to expose an antigenically highly divergent product to better escape the immune system  <cit> . such a plausible consequence is presently under investigation. however, we anticipate that, during natural infection, in the face of the immune pressure, such an antigenic shift may occur frequently. it would thus be of interest to perform sequence comparisons between naturally derived vlha gene sequences by focusing on their variable haemagglutinin portion. finally, because site-specific recombination events within vlha genes occur frequently through in vitro culture passages, inter-laboratory variations in m. synoviae stocks that had been colony purified are likely to exist.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provided an indication of the extent to which the vlha haemagglutin gene of m. synoviae could vary without compromising the surface exposure and the haemagglutinating activity of its encoded product. we thus anticipate that the antigenic repertoire of m. synoviae vlha gene could be much wider than previously thought.
