BACKGROUND
cronobacter sakazakii, a member of the genus cronobacter is linked with serious infections such as meningitis, septicaemia and necrotizing enterocolitis  in neonates and immunocompromised adults . the organism has been isolated from powdered infant formula , and various environmental sources including hospital air, dust, formula preparation areas and equipment . human carriage has been reported in saliva, teeth, faeces, breast milk, and skin  <cit> . the first genome sequenced strain of c. sakazakii was associated with a nicu outbreak at the university of tennessee hospital  <cit> . according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, this strain was recovered from an infant who had died from meningitis, two further suspected infections , and seven neonates who were asymptomatically colonised , therefore reflecting the dispersal of the strain within the nicu.

there have been other reported outbreaks of c. sakazakii  <cit> , and one of the largest was in a nicu in france claiming the lives of at least  <dig> neonates  <cit> . the outbreak lasted for approximately 3 months . a total of  <dig> neonates were infected or colonized with c. sakazakii, and  <dig> died. neonate h died of meningitis while neonates j and f died of nec. most of the neonates were under-weight with an average weight of 1461 g. with the exception of neonate d, all of the neonates were delivered pre-term. an autopsy of neonate h who died of meningitis revealed cerebral lesions. all of the infected neonates developed clinical symptoms within 28 days of birth, with the exception of neonate k who developed symptoms of nec 78 days after birth. all neonates  who died were low-weight with weights of  <dig>   <dig> and 1560 g, respectively. four of the neonates  were asymptomatically colonized while only  <dig> of the neonates  developed digestive problems of moderate nature. genotypic and phenotypic analysis of the c. sakazakii strains isolated from this outbreak has previously been undertaken by caubilla-barron  <cit> , however their study was focused on the diversity of the isolated strains and was not primarily an epidemiological investigation. their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  analysis divided all strains into four distant pulsotypes   <cit> . more than one c. sakazakii pulsotype was recovered from three neonates .

it is notable that all three fatalities during this outbreak were attributed to the pulsotype two cluster and belong to clonal complex  <dig>  of the cronobacter mlst scheme   <cit> . previous studies by our group have indicated a strong association of c. sakazakii cc <dig> with neonatal meningitis  <cit>  as well as being up to 25 % of strains isolated from milk powder and infant formula manufacturing plants  <cit> .

although pfge is still widely used in outbreak analysis, it has several limitations, for instance co-migration of the similar sized bands can obscure their discrimination and some strains do not give banding patterns  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphism  can cause significant changes in phylogenetic distances but they may not change the pfge pattern. therefore isolates may appear identical on pfge when they are not, and hence misinform an epidemiological data investigation  <cit> . snp analysis is being used to differentiate outbreak isolates which often show very low sequence diversity, such as the outbreak of e. coli o157:h <dig> attributed to salad bar and romaine lettuce contamination  <cit> .

the present study focused on a detailed genomic analysis of the c. sakazakii strains using snp analysis to reveal the relatedness of the isolates, which may guide improved epidemiological studies in the future. c. sakazakii strains previously analysed using pfge by caubilla-barron et al.  <cit>  were sequenced using the illumina miseq platform.

RESULTS
core genome phylogeny
a maximum likelihood  phylogeny of the  <dig> c. sakazakii strains was constructed from a core genome alignment using mugsy  <cit> . the topology of the phylogeny was in agreement with the earlier pfge profiles  <cit> . unfortunately, due to the long gap between the outbreak and present study, two of the isolates  have been lost from the culture collection, however the absence of these strains did not significantly affect the in-depth analysis of this outbreak at the genomic level presented in this study.

the ml phylogeny indicated four clusters within these strains, cluster  <dig> being the largest group . three of the clusters  were isolated from neonates while the fourth consisted of a lone strain isolated from an un-opened can of infant formula. the result of the whole genome phylogeny is in complete agreement with the original pfge profiles  <cit> . since the grouping of the strains was identical to the pfge profile, for clarity the clusters were given the same numbers as their earlier pulsotypes. it was interesting to note that all the strains within cluster  <dig>  belong to cronobacter mlst clonal complex   <dig> which has been associated predominantly with neonatal meningitis  <cit>  and all three neonates who died were infected by the genotype cluster  <dig> c. sakazakii cc <dig> strains  <cit> .fig.  <dig> un-rooted radial whole genome maximum likelihood tree of  <dig> c. sakazakii strains isolated from french nicu outbreak,  <dig>  the genomes of  <dig> c. sakazakii strains approximately  <dig> million bp were aligned using mugsy, core genome extracted and maximum likelihood phylogeny generated using raxml using gtrgamma substitution model. the tree was viewed and annotated using figtree and microsoft powerpoint . the phylogeny indicated  <dig> distant clusters. cluster 1: st <dig> and pfge <dig> , cluster 2: cc <dig> and pfge <dig> , cluster 3: cc <dig> and pfge  <dig> , cluster 4: cc <dig> and pfge <dig> . the scale bar indicates the rate of nucleotide differences per sequence site



single nucleotide polymorphism analysis
the snp analysis was performed only on strains in clusters  <dig> to  <dig> as the genome sequence of only a single strain from cluster  <dig> was available . using an un-related reference genome can significantly increase the number of snps which ultimately can affect the snp phylogeny  <cit> . therefore in the present study each cluster was analysed independently of the other clusters. the earliest isolate in each cluster was used as the index strain to identify snps in the subsequently isolated strains. to improve the quality of identified snps, the reference genome assembly was improved using pagit; for this purpose the finished genome of c. sakazakii sp <dig>  was used as the reference genome for ordering the contigs. the snp calls were determined using smalt and samtools as described previously. the snp phylogenies were constructed using the alignment of concatenated snp profile in each cluster, hence there were variable substitutions/nucleotide as each cluster represented a different sequence type/clonal complex.table  <dig> sequenced isolates of c. sakazakii french nicu outbreak  <dig> and snp typing

snp typing of cluster 1
five of the isolates formed cluster  <dig> which were isolated between 23rd march and 19th june  <dig> from neonates a, b, c, d and e . all of the isolates in cluster  <dig> belong to c. sakazakii cc <dig>  <cit> . two of the affected neonates  developed symptoms of necii while  <dig>  remained asymptomatic, for the remaining neonate  no clinical details were available. c. sakazakii  <dig> was the earliest isolate of this cluster. it had been isolated from the trachea of neonate a on  <dig> march  <dig> and was used as the index strain for snp typing and snp phylogeny determination .fig.  <dig> snp phylogeny of the cluster  <dig> strains. the snps were called using smalt and samtools to generate the vcf files which were filtered using vcftools to include only snps with minimum quality score of  <dig>  minimum depth of  <dig>  and minimum allele frequency of  <dig> . the snps in the cluster were concatenated and used to create a maximum likelihood phylogeny. the tree was rooted to midpoint. the red font colour indicates the reference strain. the scale bar indicates the rate of nucleotide differences per sequence site



the phylogeny and the number of the snps indicated heterogeneity within cluster  <dig> isolates. the isolate  <dig> was more closely related to the index isolate  <dig> as they differ from each other only by  <dig> snps. the remaining three strains  were relatively distant to the index strain by over  <dig> snps each. a likely scenario for the observed phylogenetic pattern is that all of the isolates obtained came from a common source where ongoing growth and evolution of c. sakazakii was occurring. these three strains could have been from earlier ingestion of contaminated reconstituted feed followed by colonisation and microevolution within the neonates before isolation. in this case, it is hard to predict the precise source of origin for the c. sakazakii isolates. c. sakazakii has the ability to survive diverse range of environments . therefore sources of contamination include the infant formula manufacturing plant or environment, the hospital environment, formula preparation area and equipment or hospital personnel.

the level of mutations observed of  <dig> snps in 78 days would be in accordance with postulated mutation rates occurring in hospital outbreaks or within patients  <cit> . the presence of an ongoing source would also presumably result in environmental contamination with a pool of bacterial diversity accumulating over time, which would also account for the diversity in the dozens of snps range seen here  <cit> . this is also supported by microbiome studies which have indicated the dispersion of bacteria in the nicu  <cit> .

snp typing of cluster 2
a total of  <dig> sequenced strains belonged to cluster  <dig> and had been isolated between 7th april and 1st july,  <dig>  all of the isolates in cluster  <dig> belong to c. sakazakii cc <dig> and were previously defined as pulsotype  <dig>  these strains had been isolated from different neonatal sites including peritoneal fluid, sputum, trachea, stools, skin, and conjunctivae. the period of isolation of these strains overlapped with cluster  <dig> strains by  <dig> months. the  <dig> cluster  <dig> strains had been isolated from nec cases at different stages, one from a septicaemia case and one from a meningitis case. the remaining two isolates were obtained from neonates o and g for whom no clinical details were provided. the earliest isolate of this cluster was c. sakazakii  <dig> isolated on 7th of april  <dig>  this strain was used as the index strain for snp calls in order to observe the strain relatedness and possible route of transmission. the snps in each of the strains isolated according to the date order were determined using samtools  and the snp phylogeny  was constructed as described earlier.fig.  <dig> 2snp phylogeny of the cluster  <dig> strains. the snps calls were obtained using smalt and samtools to generate the vcf files which were filtered using vcftools to include only snps with minimum quality score of  <dig>  minimum depth of  <dig>  and minimum allele frequency of  <dig> . the snps in the cluster were concatenated and used to create a maximum likelihood phylogeny. the tip labels shaded orange, green and yellow indicate groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively within cluster  <dig>  the red tip label shows the reference strain. the tree was rooted to midpoint. the scale bar indicates the rate of nucleotide differences per sequence site



the tree topology indicated at least three subdivisions within the cluster  <dig> strains; a group of  <dig> isolates  joined by a short branch to isolate  <dig>  and through a longer branch with three isolates  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . all of the isolates in group  <dig>  had a high degree of similarity with the index strain as shown by the small number of snp differences; a maximum of  <dig> snp differences to the index strain  <dig> 

an interesting observation was the close relatedness of the index isolate  <dig> with the prepared formula isolate  <dig> which differed by only  <dig> snps. although the index strain  <dig> was isolated at least  <dig> months earlier than the prepared formula isolate  <dig>  the tree topology and small number of snp differences suggest a possible common source of origin. the source could either be intrinsic contamination followed by growth in the neonate, or extrinsic sources such as the water used to prepare formula, colonization of feed preparation utensils or personnel. two of the isolates  were obtained from the faeces of neonate k, 14 days apart. the strains differed from each other by  <dig> snps indicating potential microevolution following infection.

the outlying single isolate c. sakazakii  <dig> was isolated from neonate h, who died of meningitis . this strain differed from the index strain by  <dig> snps, therefore from the snp typing and tree topology, it seems likely that this strain differs from the other isolates in cluster  <dig> due to microevolution from the first group.

the third group within cluster  <dig> consisted of three strains  was distant to the reference strain as indicated by tree topology and snp typing. all of the isolates in this group were obtained only from neonate b. each of these isolates differed from the index strain by more than  <dig> snps. this observation is in agreement with caubilla-barron et al. where these strains formed a sub-cluster  within the pulsotype  <dig>  <cit> . snp typing showed that the three isolates differed from each other by a maximum of  <dig> snps; since these three isolates were isolated from neonate b at different time points, the snp differences between them could be the result of a microevolution. due to the distance of the group  <dig> strains from the index strain and other isolates in cluster  <dig>  we believe that these strains indicate that neonate b may have been infected from a different source of c. sakazakii cc <dig> strains than the other neonates.

it is interesting to note that strain  <dig> from genotype cluster  <dig>  and the third group of cluster  <dig> isolates  were all isolated from neonate b. however the strains in the two clusters were entirely different  indicating that neonate b was co-infected c. sakazakii isolates belonging to different genotype clusters and clonal complexes .

snp typing of cluster 3
five of the isolates belonging to cluster  <dig> were isolated between 15th june and 27th june . two of the isolates  were obtained from neonates p and q, the former had moderate digestive problems while the later was asymptomatic. of the remaining  <dig> isolates,  <dig> isolates  were obtained from the end of the bottle while one isolate  was obtained from unused prepared formula. the date of their isolation overlapped with the isolates in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  all isolates were c. sakazakii cc <dig> and were obtained between days  <dig> and  <dig> of the first reported case in the nicu . the earliest isolate within this cluster, c. sakazakii  <dig>  was used as the index strain to call snps in the remaining four isolates. the snp typing and tree topology of the isolates obtained from neonates p and q, and isolates obtained from both the end of the bottle and prepared formula indicated that all of these strains were almost identical to the index strain with a maximum of  <dig> snps difference between the isolates . this observation indicates that the potential source of the neonate infection or colonization was prepared formula. whether the prepared formula was contaminated because of intrinsic contamination of pif or was due to contamination from a different source such as water, utensils used to prepare formula feed, or carer’s hands remains unclear. it is known that prepared feeds were temperature abused  <cit> .fig.  <dig> snp phylogeny of the cluster strains. the snps were called using smalt and samtools to generate the vcf files which were filtered using vcftools to include only snps with minimum quality score of  <dig>  minimum depth of  <dig>  and minimum allele frequency of  <dig> . the snps in the cluster were concatenated and used to create a maximum likelihood phylogeny. the red font colour indicates the reference strain. the tree was rooted to midpoint. the scale bar indicates the rate of nucleotide differences per sequence site



cluster  <dig> strain 716
the cluster  <dig> strain c. sakazakii  <dig> was isolated for unopened tin of pif. this strain belongs to mlst cc <dig> which has frequently been associated with infant formula  <cit> . however in this study no neonatal isolates were recovered which matched strain  <dig>  it is plausible that such further outbreaks were avoided due to improved control measures. at the time of the outbreaks, the nicu feeding practice was to reconstitute formula every 24 h and administer the formula over a  <dig> to 6 h period by automated infusion using an enteral syringe at room temperature. after the outbreak, internal recommendations were made to chill the enteral feeding syringe during use and to change the syringe and syringe end every 3 h.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study was aimed at the genomic analysis of a c. sakazakii outbreak in  <dig> that lasted over 3 months in a french nicu. the whole genome phylogeny indicated at least four distinct clusters for the sequenced c. sakazakii strains. each cluster was composed of isolates belonging to different sequence type; cluster 1:st <dig>  cluster 2:cc <dig>  cluster 3:cc <dig>  and cluster 4:cc <dig>  this is in agreement with forsythe et al.  <cit>  who showed that 7-loci mlst, rmlst and cog-mlst analysis agreed with whole genome phylogeny. the observation was also in agreement with the previous pfge profile analysis  <cit> , supporting the continued general usefulness of pfge to obtain an overall perspective in an outbreak. however, snp analysis has proven to be more discriminatory as it provides the best resolution at the dna level  <cit> .

genomic examination at the snp level across different c. sakazakii clusters confirmed that the clusters were completely unrelated. moreover, snp analysis was undertaken to analyse the strain relatedness within each cluster independently of the other clusters. snp analysis of cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> revealed the likelihood of a recent a common ancestor resident in the hospital environment. this is evidenced by the small number of snp differences within each cluster. the values being  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotide differences for clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides for the two subgroups in cluster 2; table  <dig>  figs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

another important observation in this study was that different c. sakazakii sequence types which were from different genotype cluster groups, colonized the same neonates  indicating the ability of c. sakazakii strains to co-exist. these isolates from two different clusters were highly divergent as indicated by snp differences  suggesting that they were acquired simultaneously from a common source composed of diverse c. sakazakii isolates. whether co-existence of c. sakazakii is linked with neonatal infections warrants further investigation and has previously been reported  <cit> . although, on this occasion, neonate c, who was colonized by isolates  <dig> and  <dig> of cluster  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, was asymptomatic.

improved practices in the manufacturing and preparation in addition to improved personal hygiene are essential to prevent the growth and transmission of this neonatal health associated pathogen.
