BACKGROUND
sleepiness and excess sleep are commonly experienced with infectious illness and other diseases, such as cancer  <cit> . sleep has been proposed to be an adaptive response to immune challenge, and to thereby have a role in sustaining a robust immune system  <cit> . the immune system and sleep are indeed tightly linked in mammals, as components of the innate immune response, particularly proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- <dig>  and tumor necrosis factor α , promote sleep likely through their actions in hypothalamic nuclei. exogenous application of these compounds increases sleep in mammals, depending on the dose, time of day and the site of injection  <cit> . in addition, loss of either the il- <dig> type i  <cit>  or the  <dig> kda tnf  <cit>  receptor in mice reduces baseline  sleep during the light hours or during the dark hours, respectively. although some of the molecular components of the mammalian immune system have a well defined role in sleep, we lack a full understanding of how these two physiological processes interact. determining how sleep is involved in the immune response will have important implications for understanding its putative role in a recovery process as well as for human health.

drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful model for studying sleep. flies exhibit all of the behavioural features of a sleep-like state  <cit> . one example of these features is that keeping flies awake for an extended period results in a compensatory sleep response, which indicates that flies have a need for this behaviour and that it is controlled by a homeostatic mechanism. key to understanding a function of sleep is to determine its relationship with other physiological processes. recent studies have indeed demonstrated that sleep in drosophila is involved in aging  <cit> , learning  <cit> , and immune responses  <cit> .

the first indication that sleep and the immune response are linked in drosophila was the observation that many immune related genes increase mrna expression after sleep deprivation  <cit> . the innate immune response in drosophila is highly conserved with that in mammals, as they express central immune signalling components with corresponding functions. for example, the nfκb protein relish, which is most similar to nfκb <dig> or p <dig> in humans  <cit> , is central to the immune deficiency  pathway in flies, and is sensitive to injury and infection with gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in our previous report, we confirmed that relish gene expression increases with short term sleep deprivation  <cit> , which is consistent with observations that nfκb activity increases in the brain of mouse or rat  <cit>  and human blood mononuclear cells  <cit>  after sleep deprivation. we also demonstrated that flies deficient in, but not lacking, relish expression exhibit decreased baseline, or spontaneous undisturbed sleep  <cit> .

to further explore the association between sleep and the immune response, we determined the effect of infection with gram-negative bacteria and aseptic injury on sleep in drosophila. we show that the immune response triggered by both infection and injury promotes sleep in flies and that this effect is controlled by the circadian clock. we also show that the nfκb relish has a strong role in promoting sleep during the immune response and that its expression in fat body is required for its effect on sleep. together, these data suggest a role of sleep in a recovery process during immune challenge and demonstrate a behavioral feature of drosophila sleep that is shared with that in mammals.

RESULTS
infection and injury promote sleep
we monitored sleep in canton special  flies during an immune response that was triggered either by infection  with e. coli or by aseptic injury . a handled control group  was subjected to the same handling such that they were removed from the activity monitors and co <dig> anesthetized for the same duration, but they were not infected or injured. flies were generally monitored for three baseline days and received treatment on the fourth day at one of four different time points in a 12:  <dig> light: dark  cycle: zt  <dig>  zt  <dig>  zt  <dig> or zt  <dig> . sleep was monitored for three days after treatment.

significant increases in sleep were observed in both injured and infected groups relative to hc in the morning hours after treatment. specifically, the most robust and consistent increase in sleep was from zt 0- <dig> , but occasionally lasted up to  <dig> h . a representative experiment is illustrated in figure 1a, where flies were treated at zt  <dig>  and a significant increase in sleep was observed the following morning  in both infected and injured groups. treatment at other times of day also produced increases in sleep the morning after treatment, from zt 0- <dig>  but with variable effects . in particular, treatment during night time hours produced stronger effects than those in the day time.

we further analyzed the effect of time-of-day of infection and injury on sleep by comparing the net changes in sleep that occurred in the morning from zt 0- <dig>  after treatment at one of four time points across the day . to correct for effects of handling, net change in sleep was determined in each fly by calculating the difference in time sleeping in minutes from zt 0- <dig> before and after treatment and normalizing to the change in sleep observed between the corresponding time points in the handled control group . analysis of variance  revealed a significant effect of time-of-day of treatment in both injured and infected groups . post-hoc comparisons indicated that mean change in sleep from zt 0- <dig> that was induced by infection or injury at night, zt  <dig> and zt  <dig>  was significantly larger than sleep induced by that in the daytime, zt  <dig> and zt  <dig> .

to ensure that the daily oscillation of the sleep increase associated with the immune response was not an effect of a 12: <dig> ld cycle, cs flies were infected or injured on the third day in constant darkness . similar to the effect during ld, both infected and injured flies showed an increase in sleep in the subjective morning hours from ct 0- <dig>  after treatment. the increase in sleep was significantly higher when flies were treated during subjective nighttime  than during subjective daytime  in both infected and injured groups .

to exclude the possibility that the increase in sleep was due to an effect on the flies' ability to move by debilitating injury due to the injection, we calculated the average number of activity counts per waking minute  for flies treated at zt  <dig>  we focused on treatment at zt  <dig>  because this time point produced highly robust effects on sleep as well as on survival rate in response to infection with pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . if the increase in sleep was due to an effect on the flies' ability to move by injury, we would expect a decrease in activity rate. instead, waking activity rates were unchanged in the infected group, and higher in injured groups as compared to hc , indicating that the increase in sleep is not simply a reflection of lack of movement associated with injury.

in summary, an immune response triggered by infection or injury promotes sleep. the increase in sleep is restricted to the morning hours after treatment, and is dependent on the time of day of treatment such that night time treatment produced stronger effects than those in the daytime. this pattern persists in constant darkness, which strongly suggests a role of the circadian clock in regulating this response.

the observation that night-time infection produces a stronger effect on sleep than that in the daytime correlates with a previous observation that infection with pathogenic gram-negative bacteria at night-time produced a better survival outcome than that in the daytime  <cit> . whether the increased sleep experienced by the host contributes to survival during pathogenic infection will be an interesting topic for future study. interestingly, an earlier study reported a disruption of circadian locomotor rhythm and sleep in flies after infection with gram-positive pathogenic strains of bacteria  <cit> , which contrasts with our current findings. one possible explanation for this is the different species of bacteria used in each of the studies. the pattern of sleep alteration associated with bacterial infection in mammals is also dependent on the bacterial species and route of infection  <cit> . nonetheless, shirasu-hiza and colleagues  <cit>  also proposed that in this case, the disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep was a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of the infection, thus further supporting a beneficial role of sleep in host defense.

both infection and injury increase nfκb reporter activity
sleep is a complex process that is sensitive to many different manipulations. it is therefore not surprising that injury and infection produce effects on sleep that are indistinguishable. to ensure the effect was not restricted to e. coli, flies were also infected with a mutated gram-negative bacterial line p. aeruginosa  which has pathogenic ability  <cit> . a similar increase in sleep was observed in the morning from zt 0- <dig> after nighttime treatment at zt  <dig> in both infected and injured groups .

both infection and injury trigger equivalent effects on a cellular immune response  <cit> . infection with gram-negative bacteria, in particular, activates the nfκb relish, which is central to the imd pathway. injury also induces relish-dependent gene expression, but to a lesser extent than infection  <cit> . to confirm this finding, we measured nfκb dependent luciferase activity in living flies which contain an nfκb response element upstream of a luciferase reporter gene . both infection with e. coli and injury at zt  <dig> produced significant increases in κb-luc activity by the next morning, at zt  <dig>  relative to baseline . no significant change in reporter activity was detected in the hc group . κb-luc was increased by approximately  <dig> fold relative to hc in injured flies, and  <dig> fold in infected flies. κb-luc activity was also sensitive to infection at zt  <dig> with p. aeruginosa. large increases in κb-luc activity were detected at zt  <dig>   <dig> hours after the infection , and were further increased at zt  <dig> . the delay in onset of κb-luc activity is consistent with a previous finding that p. aeruginosa infection delayed the onset of expression of antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

these results demonstrate that while infection and injury produce similar effects on sleep, they are clearly distinguishable at a molecular level. the increase in κb-luc activity by injury is comparable to that induced by a short term sleep deprivation  <cit> , and both are sufficient to promote sleep . the observation that infection produces a sustained increase in κb-luc activity  suggests that a component other than nfκb limits the duration and timing of sleep during immune challenge.

sleep during the immune response is disrupted in a clock mutant
to understand why the increase in sleep during an immune response was restricted to the morning hours, we further examined a role of the circadian clock in this process. we measured sleep during the immune response in flies which contain a mutation in the clock gene, period . period is an integral component of the biological clock in insects and vertebrate species  <cit> . sleep-wake activity in per <dig> loss of function mutants fluctuates in ld cycles, but is completely arrhythmic in constant darkness  <cit> .

sleep in the morning from zt 0- <dig> after infection with e. coli or aseptic injury in per <dig> flies was not significantly affected as compared to hc regardless of the time-of-day of treatment . instead, we found that sleep increased immediately after treatment, with the most robust effects occurring within the first four hours . the immediate increase in sleep in the infected group was significant as compared to hc  and no significant oscillation across time points was detected . sleep also increased immediately after injury, but increases were lower when flies were treated during the night time . figure 3b illustrates an experiment performed in per <dig> mutants treated at night-time, zt  <dig>  sleep after manipulation at this time was clearly decreased in the hc group. an earlier study reported that ld cycles mask locomotor behaviour that is otherwise arrhythmic in these flies  <cit> . the sharp decrease in sleep in the control group is thus attributed to the light exposure that was necessary for administering the injections in the treatment groups. nonetheless, the flies subjected to infection or injury slept more despite the exposure to light. wild type cs flies and per01;;per flies, discussed below, did not show this sensitivity to light exposure . handling of per <dig> flies during the daytime period, at zt  <dig> and  <dig>  did not produce any changes in sleep in the control group, while sleep in flies subjected to infection or injury at these times produced significant increases in sleep that occurred immediately after the treatment .

to confirm the role of period in the sleep promoting effect, we examined sleep behaviour during the immune response in per <dig> flies expressing a full-length genomic construct of the period gene , as previously described  <cit> . locomotor activity rhythms are restored in per <dig> flies carrying this transgene  <cit> . as compared to hc groups, per01;;per flies showed significant increases in sleep in the morning from zt 0- <dig> after injury at zt  <dig>  zt  <dig>  and zt  <dig> . infection with e. coli also produced a significant increase in morning sleep relative to hc, but only when flies were infected at zt  <dig> . in both infected and injured groups, the time-of-day effect on the morning increase in sleep was restored in the per01;;per flies . night-time treatment produced stronger effects on morning sleep than that in the daytime . in contrast to per <dig> mutants, the immediate effect on sleep occurred only when per01;;per flies were treated at zt  <dig> . interestingly, cs flies also exhibited a strong immediate effect on sleep after infection  and injury  at zt  <dig>  but not at zt  <dig> or at zt  <dig>  treatment at zt  <dig> produced weaker effects on sleep from zt 12- <dig> with an increase of  <dig> ±  <dig> minutes  in injured flies. infected flies also increased sleep at this time, but the increase fell short of significance .

together, these data demonstrate a role of the circadian clock in an adaptive behavioural response to bacterial infection and injury. the effect on sleep is gated by the clock, such that the response is restricted to early morning hours. thus the clock permits a response when flies are subjected to immune challenge at the onset of this period  or at earlier times during the night before . however, this permissive gate is 'closed' shortly after the morning period, and flies do not increase sleep when challenged at zt  <dig>  as discussed above, this gating pattern persists in constant dark conditions  and is abolished in per <dig> mutants, which lack a functional clock. these findings correlate with those of an earlier study which reported that night-time infection of flies with pathogenic bacteria produced better survival rates than that in the daytime  <cit> . furthermore, per <dig> flies were more susceptible to infection. whether this is due to a disrupted sleep response or to other aspects of host defense is an interesting topic for future study.

relish is required for the sleep promoting effect of the immune response
we next determined a role of the nfκb relish in sleep that is triggered by an immune response. we focused on relish because our previous study indicated that expression of its mrna was very strongly affected by sleep deprivation, and that heterozygous mutants had reduced baseline, or spontaneous sleep  <cit> . furthermore, as discussed above, relish dependent gene expression is increased with both infection and injury . homozygous relishe <dig>  null mutants are severely immunocompromised and die within a few days after infection with non-pathogenic bacteria such as e. coli  <cit> . e <dig> homozygous flies in a cs background  <cit>  were subjected to infection with e. coli or aseptic injury, as described above. flies infected at zt  <dig>  and at zt  <dig>  did not increase sleep as compared to hc and instead, continued to maintain a relatively normal sleep pattern until they died. sleep from zt 0- <dig> in both infected and injured e <dig> flies showed no significant change as compared to hc  but showed significantly reduced net changes in sleep as compared to cs flies . to ensure the differences between wild-type and e <dig> flies was not attributable to handling, we compared sleep in handled control groups from zt 0- <dig> during baseline  with sleep during the morning after treatment. no significant change in sleep was detected . together, these observations indicate that the nfκb relish is required for the increase in sleep during the immune response.

we next performed studies to confirm that this phenotype was attributable to a lesion in the relish gene. first, another relish null allele, relishe <dig>   <cit> , was examined. similar to the e <dig> flies, e <dig> mutants did not increase sleep in response to infection with e. coli or to injury . the net change in sleep during the immune response was also significantly smaller as compared to cs flies .

we next determined whether expressing a uas-relish transgene in fat bodies in e <dig> mutants could restore the increase in sleep during the immune response. fat bodies are masses of adipose tissue located throughout the fly and are a major site of immune signaling and metabolism  <cit> . to circumvent the effects of genetic background, we used the ru486-dependent gal <dig> driver s <dig>  <cit> , which expresses specifically in fat body. s1106-gal4/uas-rel; e <dig> flies that were chronically fed ru <dig> showed a significant increase in sleep from zt 0- <dig> after treatment at zt  <dig> as compared to siblings of the same genotype that were fed a vehicle control . to determine whether the effect of relish on sleep was specific to fat bodies, we used a pan-neuronal ru486-dependent gal <dig> driver, elav-geneswitch   <cit>  to express uas-rel in the central nervous system. neither the ru486-fed nor vehicle control fed elav-gs/uas-rel; e <dig> flies showed a significant increase in morning sleep after infection  or injury  at zt  <dig> . thus uas-rel restores sleep during an immune response in e <dig> mutants when expressed in fat bodies, but not in neurons.

these data demonstrate that relish is necessary for the sleep promoting effect of the immune response and that its expression in fat body is sufficient for this effect. in our previous study, we reported that relish also functioned from fat body to modulate baseline or spontaneous undisturbed sleep such that sleep was reduced in heterozygous relish null mutants, but not affected in relish homozygous mutants  <cit> . we now report that relish homozygous mutants virtually abolish a sleep promoting effect of the immune response. together these observations indicate that sleep induced by infection or injury is different from baseline sleep and that each is controlled by different mechanisms. others have proposed that baseline and rebound sleep, which is sleep after prolonged wakefulness or sleep deprivation, are also controlled by different mechanisms  <cit> . for example, hyperkinetic and shaker mutations strongly reduce daily sleep levels, but do not alter responses to sleep deprivation  <cit> . in contrast, a recent study described a hypomorph of the sleepless gene that minimally affected baseline sleep but had severe effects on sleep rebound  <cit> . mutants of the clock gene, cycle, also reduced baseline sleep  <cit> , but produced sex dimorphic effects on sleep rebound  <cit> . thus the results described here indicate that the predominant role of relish in sleep is during a recovery period after immune challenge.

as discussed earlier, injury and infection produce distinct effects on κb-luc activity such that the effect of infection increases reporter activity to a much greater extent . given the role of relish in sleep induced by immune challenge, one may expect that the impact of infection on sleep would be greater than that during aseptic injury. this is clearly not the case, which suggests that a component other than nfκb limits the duration of the morning sleep response. one possibility is that the pressure to be awake at this time of day outweighs the pressure to sleep. however, the duration of this response was unchanged in per <dig> mutants. in particular, daytime infection or injury in these flies produced an immediate increase in sleep that lasted approximately four hours, which is similar to the duration of the morning increase in sleep seen in wild type flies. this observation suggests that the circadian clock determines when the response occurs, but does not determine the duration of the effect on sleep. we propose that while relish is necessary for inducing sleep during an immune response, a separate mechanism is involved in limiting the duration of sleep during a recovery period. this mechanism may involve neural circuits in the brain, which are known to regulate sleep . alternatively, negative regulatory factors that act directly on relish target genes are also potential candidates that may be involved in this process  <cit> .

studies in mammals have shown that blocking il- <dig> or tnfα cytokines also prevent increased sleep during immune challenge , which is consistent with our current findings. nfκb p <dig> knockout mice also show reduced sleep responses to infection with influenza virus, but had enhanced responses to immune challenge with bacterial lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . although relish has similarity with p <dig>  it is possible that different nfκb family members in both mammals and flies will have distinct roles in baseline sleep and in sleep induced by infection or injury.

CONCLUSIONS
the observation that the immune response promotes sleep in drosophila demonstrates an additional feature of insect sleep that is shared with that in mammals. the effect of infection and injury on sleep is gated by the circadian clock, such that the effect is restricted to the morning after treatment and is affected by the time-of-day of the treatment. night-time injury or infection with gram-negative bacteria produced stronger effects than equivalent manipulations in the daytime. this pattern is disrupted in the per <dig> clock mutant, which responds by increasing sleep immediately after infection or injury. these findings correlate with the observation that survival rates were lower when flies were infected with gram-negative pathogenic bacteria in the daytime than at nighttime  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that relish is required for the sleep promoting effect of the immune response, and that its expression in fat body is sufficient for this process. together, these findings suggest that adaptive sleep during an immune response involves an integration of signals from the peripheral immune system and the circadian clock. further genetic dissection of this process will better our understanding of a function of sleep in recovery from immune challenge or injury.
