BACKGROUND
among domestic animals, the water buffalo , particularly the river buffalo, holds great promise and potential for animal production. according to estimates by the "food and agriculture organization of the united nations" the global water buffalo population has increased 98% in the last decades, from  <dig> million in  <dig> to  <dig> million in  <dig>  buffalo is the most important farm animal species in asia, especially india, where it is extensively used for milk, meat, fuel and fertilizer production , as well as for draught power  <cit> . currently, river buffalo can be found in many countries worldwide. the growth of its population outside of the asian continent is mainly related to the increasing interest in milk production used to produce cream, butter, yogurt and many cheeses. brazil, for instance, is the largest buffalo breeding center outside the asian continent holding the largest buffalo herd in the americas.

river buffalo, along with domestic cattle, belongs to the subfamily bovinae whereas sheep and goat belong to the subfamily caprinae, all members of the family bovidae. these species have been shown to be closely related, sharing homology in chromosome banding  <cit>  and gene mapping  <cit> , and have been cytogenetically characterized in detail.

cattle  and river buffalo  chromosomes can be matched arm for arm at the cytogenetic level  <cit> . while the cattle genome consists of  <dig> acrocentric autosomes and a pair, x/y, of sexual chromosomes, the river buffalo genome has  <dig> biarmed and  <dig> acrocentric autosomes plus the x and y chromosomes  <cit> . all buffalo chromosomes arms have homology to single bovine acrocentric chromosomes. bbu <dig> appears to be a fusion of bta <dig> and  <dig>  bbu <dig> equals bta <dig> and  <dig>  bbu <dig> equals bta <dig> and  <dig>  bbu <dig> equals bta <dig> and  <dig>  and bbu <dig> equals bta <dig> and  <dig> at the cytogenetic level with state of the art banding. all the other chromosomes have a one to one correspondence between the two species  <cit> .

although the latest cytogenetic map of the river buffalo genome reports  <dig> fish-mapped loci  <cit> , much remains to be done in order to generate high resolution maps of the buffalo genome.

the radiation hybrid  mapping approach has been established as the method of choice to generate medium to high resolution maps. rh panels are available for several domestic mammalian species such as cow  <cit> , pig  <cit> , horse  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and cat  <cit> . the production of a rh panel in river buffalo is quite recent  <cit> . it has been used to construct preliminary rh maps for individual buffalo chromosomes, bbu <dig>  <cit> ; bbu <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> ; bbu <dig>  <cit> ; bbu <dig>  <cit>  and bbux  <cit> . these preliminary maps, based on cattle-derived markers, demonstrated that the bovine genome is a useful source of markers for the buffalo genome mapping allowing rapid and efficient transfer of information from cattle to buffalo.

taking advantage of the extensive resources and tools now available as a result of the bovine genome sequencing project, and given the close evolutionary relationship between cattle and river buffalo, the opportunity was available for study of the buffalo genome on a large scale to detect micro rearrangements in the marker order that might have taken place during the evolutionary divergence of these species. of particular importance is the comparison of gene order between the two ruminant species, buffalo and cattle, and an assessment of rearrangements which is independent of previous, more limited comparisons done with specific markers of the two species by somatic hybrid cell analysis and fish.

a high resolution genome map of buffalo will be an important tool for evaluating chromosomal evolution among species of bovidae which, according to several phylogenetic studies, are separated by only a few million years  <cit> . it will therefore facilitate extrapolation of data from cattle genomics and at some point aid in the development of additional genomic tools for buffalo. here, we report the use of the bburh <dig> panel to construct the first-generation whole genome radiation hybrid map  of the river buffalo containing more than  <dig> cattle-derived loci covering all autosomes and the x chromosome.

RESULTS
in this report, we present the first-generation whole genome radiation hybrid map of the river buffalo . from the total of  <dig> markers used to assemble the maps,  <dig> could not be placed on the maps, so  <dig> are included on the rh maps of  <dig> autosomes and the x chromosome.

this is the first genome-wide rh map of the river buffalo and establishes a base genomic map from which higher resolution maps can be generated in the future. this first generation map also provides a characterization of the bburh <dig> panel allowing estimation of its potential limit of resolution. the bbu wg-rh map spans a total of  <dig>  cr. however, accurate physical distances are not available for the genome lengths spanned by this wg-rh map. because karyotype analysis indicates extensive similarity at the level of chromosome arms between buffalo and cattle, and presuming a genome size of  <dig> mbp in both species, we extrapolate the physical distance of the buffalo genome to be approximately  <dig> mbp, providing an estimate of  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  the bburh <dig> panel clones retained buffalo dna with an average retention rate of  <dig> % and  <dig>  kb/cr <dig>  a summary of the river buffalo wg-rh map statistics is shown in additional file  <dig> 

markers were distributed into linkage groups based on two-point lod score threshold of ≥  <dig> to assign linkage to a particular group of markers and not to others located on different chromosomes. a total of  <dig> linkage groups were generated for the whole genome. the number of markers mapped to each chromosome varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the rh maps from the bi-armed chromosomes presented at least two linkage groups  with the exception of bbu  <dig>  in which markers were distributed into a single linkage group. among the acrocentric chromosomes, the number of linkage groups ranged from 1– <dig> with bbu <dig> containing the greatest number of linkage groups , but also had the fewest mapped cattle-derived sts markers . considering that the markers mapped on bbu <dig> are almost entirely derived from cattle snps, the increased number of linkage groups observed might be related to the irregular distribution of the snps on the bovine chromosome  <dig>  which is known to be homologous to bbu <dig>  the number of linkage groups and the total number of markers per chromosome is also presented in additional file  <dig> 

the average retention frequency  for the data set is  <dig> %, with the frequency for individual autosomes varying from  <dig> % on bbu <dig> to  <dig> % on bbu <dig>  which contains the selectable marker thymidine kinase . the average retention frequency per chromosome observed on the bburh panel is similar to the estimates reported for other  <dig> rad panels such as those constructed for cattle  <cit> , horse  <cit>  and dog  <cit> . the relatively low rf for bbux  was expected, since the buffalo parental cell line was created from a male animal. the variation in retention frequency for each chromosome is shown graphically in figure  <dig> 

preliminary rh maps for individual bbu chromosomes  have been previously published  <cit> . the new maps presented herein demonstrate a considerable increase in the number of mapped markers resulting in maps with greatly improved coverage over the previously published data. in addition to  <dig> chromosome maps published for the first time, the remaining six chromosomes are presented with the following number of additional markers: bbu <dig> , bbu <dig> , bbu <dig> , bbu <dig> , bbu <dig>  and bbux . an example is shown in figure  <dig> with bbu <dig> illustrating the improvement regarding the marker density obtained with the new rh map. in general, the order of the markers between the new and the previous rh maps shows a high level of agreement except for minor flips involving closely linked loci.

to date, this is the first whole genome rh and comparative map produced for the river buffalo. also, this is the first report illustrating the extensive use of cross-species oligo assays to produce rh maps, a technique which contributed significantly to the total number of markers placed on the maps. in addition, this bbu wg-rh map, containing  <dig> markers, is the most dense among the first-generation rh maps produced for other domestic species, such as pig   <cit> , cattle   <cit> , horse   <cit> , cat   <cit>  and dog   <cit> . in addition, this map was assembled with fewer rh linkage groups  than previously-reported for first-generation rh maps in cattle   <cit> , pig   <cit>  and horse   <cit> .

because traditional genetic maps are not currently available for river buffalo, we compared the order of the markers from the bbu-wg rh maps to the current bovine genome sequence assembly . figure  <dig> shows a schematic overview of the wg-rh map in comparison with their respective homologous chromosome in bta. to be able to extrapolate the information between the genomes it is necessary to align conserved segments accurately between species. mapping a large number of markers on the buffalo genome and cross-referencing these with the map locations for the markers in the bovine achieved this alignment.

sixty-eight markers previously assigned by fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit>  were incorporated into the rh maps serving as anchor markers for the rh maps to correctly orient the linkage groups. all chromosomes, except bbu <dig>  had at least one marker previously mapped by fish represented on the respective rh map. figure  <dig> shows in detail the comparative mapping between the bbu <dig> rh map, the latest g-banded ideogram of the river buffalo chromosome  <cit>  and the alignment with the bovine genome sequence assembly . considering the large number of mapped markers, only one marker per  <dig> cr is presented in the rh map figure for better illustration. the individual bbu rh comparative maps from the entire buffalo genome are displayed in additional file  <dig>  also, a complete version of the rh maps containing all the mapped markers can be viewed at the national center for biological  river buffalo genome page .

the comparison revealed few disagreements between the bbu rh maps, the cytogenetic map and the bovine sequence assembly. marker order within the linkage groups for the buffalo chromosomes was consistent with the bovine genome assembly and, where information was available, in agreement with the cytogenetic assignment. as indicated on figure  <dig>  few discrepancies on the markers order were observed. interestingly, most of the disagreements observed with the bovine sequence assembly, for example, those observed on bbu <dig>  bbu <dig> and bbu <dig>  involved markers derived from cattle snps. an exception was observed on the bbu <dig> rh map, which showed disagreements on the position of five genes, klhl <dig>  tram1l <dig> and ugdh from lg7a and, gpr <dig> and tkl <dig> from lg7b. these discrepancies in marker order within conserved segments might indicate small chromosome rearrangements, but could also be due to the insufficient resolution of the rh map in specific regions of the chromosomes or mistakes in the bovine sequence assembly. the number of observed disagreements in marker order positions among our rh maps and the bovine sequence and the river buffalo cytogenetic assignment may contribute to improved maps for buffalo as well as maps for other members of the bovidae family.

considering the limited genomic resources available for the river buffalo, the comparative mapping information presented here can be used to identify chromosomal regions potentially associate with traits that have been genetically mapped in other livestock. with the availability of the bovine genome sequence assembly it was possible to align the buffalo rh maps with the bovine genome and to obtain a large amount of information on the markers likely to also be found at a particular chromosomal location in buffalo.

CONCLUSIONS
we have built the first-generation radiation hybrid map of the river buffalo  genome using the bburh <dig> panel and cattle-derived markers. considering that genetic maps are absent for river buffalo, our goal was to provide a resource for positional candidate cloning of genes associate with complex traits and also for large-scale physical mapping of the river buffalo genome. the comparison with the bovine sequence assembly provides information sufficient for genome-wide scans to detect chromosomal regions contributing to economically important traits in river buffalo.
