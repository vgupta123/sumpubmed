BACKGROUND
adenine , uracil  and sugar nucleotides  are universal and phylogenetically-ancient signaling molecules involved in a multitude of biological processes, from embryogenesis to adult homeostasis. actions of extracellular nucleotides on target cells are mediated by specific membrane receptors: the ligand-gated p2x channels, and the g protein-coupled p2y receptors, which are widely distributed in human tissues  <cit> .

p2y receptors have recently attracted a lot of interest from the scientific community, since they belong to the 7-transmembrane  rhodopsin family of g-protein-coupled receptors , which are the target of more than 60% of currently marketed drugs  <cit> . besides the already characterized gpcrs, the recent publication of the human genome has revealed the presence of more that  <dig> "orphan" gpcrs, i.e., receptors responding to yet-unidentified endogenous ligands. due to the crucial roles of gpcrs in human pathophysiology, their "deorphanization" is believed to unveil novel biological targets for drug discovery. of interest for the purinergic field, several orphan gpcrs are closely structurally and phylogenetically related to the p2y receptor family .

eight distinct p2y receptors are currently recognized: the p2y <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  receptors  <cit> . the missing numbers in the p2y1– <dig> sequence represent gpcrs cloned from nonmammalian vertebrates or receptors for which a functional response to nucleotides has not yet been convincingly demonstrated. pharmacologically, p2y receptors can be subdivided into  adenine nucleotide-preferring receptors mainly responding to adp and atp. this group includes human and rodent p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig>  and human p2y11;  uracil nucleotide-preferring receptors. this group includes human p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> responding to either utp or udp;  receptors of mixed selectivity ; and  receptors responding solely to the sugar nucleotides udp-glucose and udp-galactose   <cit> . from a phylogenetic and structural  point of view, two distinct p2y receptor subgroups characterized by a relatively high level of sequence divergence have been identified  <cit> . the first subgroup includes p2y <dig> , <dig> , <dig> subtypes and the second subgroup encompasses the p2y <dig> , <dig> subtypes. alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned p2y receptors has shown that the human members of this family are  <dig> to 48% identical. the highest degree of sequence identity is found among the second subgroup of p2y <dig> , <dig>  due to wide involvement in regulation of physiological phenomena, dysfunctions of nucleotides and their receptors have been associated to various human diseases, including immune and ischemic/inflammatory conditions .

cysteinyl-leukotrienes  are inflammatory lipid mediators generated by 5-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid acting through g protein-coupled cyslt <dig> and cyslt <dig> receptors and implicated in bronchial asthma, stroke and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> .

recent data highlight the existence of a functional cross-talk between the nucleotide and the cysteinyl-lt systems. both types of mediators accumulate at sites of inflammation, and inflammatory cells often co-express both p2y and cyslt receptors. in rat microglia, the brain immune cells involved in response to cerebral hypoxia and trauma, activation of p2y <dig> and cyslt receptors mediates co-release of nucleotides and cysteinyl-lts  <cit> , which might, in turn, contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. in human monocyte/macrophage-like cells, cyslt <dig> receptor function is regulated by extracellular nucleotides via heterologous desensitization  <cit> , and, in the same cells, montelukast and pranlukast, two selective cyslt <dig> receptor antagonists  <cit> , functionally interact with p2y receptor signaling pathways  <cit> . challenge of human mast cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- <dig> induced a yet-unidentified elusive receptor responsive to both ltc <dig> and udp  <cit> . finally, there are close structural and phylogenetic relationships between the p2y and cyslt receptor families. both p2y and cyslt receptors cluster together into the "purine receptor cluster" of gpcrs, which also includes a large number of "orphan" receptors still awaiting identification  <cit> . among these receptors, nonaka and co-workers identified gpr <dig> as the closest receptor to the p2y <dig> , <dig> subgroup  <cit> . these authors also identified four tm motifs which are fully conserved in both gpr <dig>  p2y <dig> , <dig>  cyslt <dig> and cyslt <dig> receptors and are not found in other gpcrs  <cit> . based on these structural relatedness, they hypothesized that all these receptors should respond to both nucleotides and cysteinyl-lts. however, while p2y <dig> was found to be promiscuously activated by both nucleotides and cyslte <dig>  <cit> , gpr <dig> was subsequently reported to specifically respond to lysophosphatidic acid and not to be activated by either atp, udp or udp-glucose  <cit> . this suggests that the presence of specific structural motifs may be necessary but not sufficient to unequivocally define the pharmacological specificity of a given receptor.

another member of the "purine receptor cluster" , seemed particularly attractive to us, since it is located at intermediate phylogenetic position between p2y and cyslt receptors and is the closest receptor to a common ancestor which also originated the p2y <dig> , <dig> and cyslt <dig> and cyslt <dig> .

on this basis, we have recently cloned and deorphanized gpr17; we demonstrated that its heterologous expression in a number of different cell lines results in the appearance of highly specific responses to both uracil nucleotides  and cysteinyl-lts  <cit> . agonists response profile of gpr <dig>  as determined in vitro by gtpgammas binding, was different from those of already known cyslt and p2y receptors, with ec <dig> values in the nmolar and μmolar range, for cysteinyl-lts and uracil nucleotides, respectively.

several established p2y and cyslt antagonists, namely, the p2y <dig> selective antagonist 2'-deoxy-n6-methyladenosine 3',5'-biphosphate , the p2y12/ <dig> antagonist n--2--beta, gamma-dichloromethylene-atp , and the cyslt <dig> antagonists montelukast and pranlukast were found to be able to counteract gpr <dig> activation in vitro  <cit> . both human and rat gpr <dig> are highly expressed in organs typically undergoing ischemic damage, i.e., brain, heart and kidney. based on this and on the demonstration that both cysteinyl-lts and nucleotides massively accumulate in ischemic brain  <cit>  we also analyzed the role of gpr <dig> in a model of focal brain ischemia in the rat. in vivo inhibition of gpr <dig> achieved by either pharmacological agents able to counteract its in vitro activation  or by the intracerebral injection of an anti-sense oligonucleotide specifically designed to knock down this receptor, dramatically reduced ischemic damage, suggesting gpr <dig> as the common molecular target mediating brain damage by nucleotides and cysteinyl-lts. thus, gpr <dig> is the first fully characterized "hybrid" gpcr responding to two unrelated families of non-peptide signalling molecules and represents a previously unexplored therapeutic target for brain ischemia.

the possibility of interfering with cerebral ischemia progression has obvious relevant implications for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches for management of human stroke. based on the data summarized above, it can be anticipated that selective gpr <dig> antagonists may represent a novel class of neuroprotective agents able to counteract damage evolution  <cit> . moreover, we anticipate that new chemical entities targeting both components of this dualistic receptor may prove extremely more effective than "standard" antagonists, thus leading to the development of novel dualistic pharmacological agents with previously unexplored therapeutic potential. however, none of the pharmacological agents utilized in the ciana et al. study are really selective for gpr <dig>  since montelukast is also active at cyslt <dig> receptors  <cit>  and, conversely, cangrelor also inhibits p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors  <cit> . on the other hand, the design and synthesis of selective gpr <dig> antagonist ligands would greatly benefit from the knowledge of receptor three-dimensional  structure and from the definition of its ligand binding mode. gpcrs are characterized by highly conserved structural topology, consisting of the seven tm helices bundle , the eighth amphipathic helix , an extracellular n-terminus region , a cytoplasmic c-terminus tail  and three extracellular  and intracellular  loops connecting helices  <cit> .

these structural features are shared among protein sequences that have very low similarity with the only 3-d structure so far known, i.e. bovine rhodopsin   <cit> .

nevertheless, brh-based homology modeling combined with dynamic simulations and experimental data have been successfully used to investigate the ligand-receptor features of several gpcrs: this procedure has been demonstrated to be useful for rational drug design  <cit> . since  <dig>  many studies have focused on ligand binding mode and on the design of selective nucleotide analogues for other nucleotide receptors, starting from p2y <dig>  <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis has been applied to the elucidation of p2y receptor structure and ligand binding modalities. some positively charged residues in tm  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the p2y <dig> and p2y <dig> receptors have been shown to be crucial for receptor activation by nucleotides  <cit> . they probably interact with the negative charges of the phosphate groups of nucleotides, since it is known that the receptor ligands are nucleotidic species uncomplexed to magnesium or calcium. actually, the eight p2y receptors identified so far have a h-x-x-r/k motif in tm <dig>  the p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors share a y-q/k-x-x-r motif in tm <dig>  whereas another motif, k-e-x-x-l is found in p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors  <cit> . more recently, for p2y <dig>  p2y <dig>  and p2y <dig> receptors, one additional lysine residue in el <dig> has been suggested to be particularly important for nucleotide binding  <cit> . it would be interesting to assess if the same aminoacid residues proposed to be important for nucleotide binding in p2y receptors are also involved in binding of gpr <dig> to purinergic ligands. the present work was specifically aimed at modeling the 3-d structure of gpr <dig>  with the goal of designing new and selective ligands by defining the binding mode of its endogenous agonist udp and of two nucleotide-derived compounds, such as mrs <dig> and cangrelor, which have been reported to act as antagonists at this receptor .

RESULTS
the structure of the receptor
as a first step to the rational design of selective gpr <dig> ligands, a homology model of human gpr <dig>  was built using as a template the x-ray crystal structure of brh obtained at  <dig>  Å resolution and deposited in the protein data bank as 1u <dig>   <cit> . the sequence identity shared by hgpr <dig> and brh is only 21% , that is the same order of magnitude shared by brh and other related nucleotide receptors for which modeling has been successfully applied for a long time. the sequence of gpr <dig> consists of  <dig> aminoacids, corresponding to the human receptor sequence in its shorter isoform .

multiple alignment of gpr <dig> with p2y receptors, cyslt receptors and brh, reported in additional file: figure  <dig> , showed the existence of two conserved cysteines among the various sequences  which are conserved in the great majority of gpcrs. the corresponding cysteines in brh form a disulphide bridge; this structural feature was assumed also for gpr <dig> 

the receptor has an additional pair of cysteines which are conserved in all the p2y and cyslt receptors; these two residues are positioned at the end of the nt  and at the middle of the el <dig> domain , respectively . interestingly, these residues are not present in brh. it has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and ligand affinity data that corresponding cysteines in p2y <dig> form a disulphide bridge which is important for receptor activation  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows a detail of the multiple sequence alignment of gpr <dig>  brh, all the p2y and cyslt receptors highlighting the formation of a second putative disulphide bridge. in agreement with our previous studies suggesting functional and phylogenetic relationships between gpr <dig>  p2y and cyslt receptors  <cit> , we included this additional disulphide bridge into the 3-d model of gpr <dig> 

the initial structure obtained from homology modeling was topologically close to the template; polar hydrogens were added and optimization of sidechains was run in cycles in which the backbone was kept fixed.

the locally minimised structure has been then embedded in a fully hydrated phospholipidic bilayer , as described in methods.

the brh x-ray file derived from the crystal asymmetric unit reports  <dig> water molecules associated with both chain a and chain b. these molecules are localized in the vicinity of highly conserved residues and in the retinal pocket, and they are probably involved in the regulation of the activity of brh-like gpcrs  <cit> .

in addition to the water molecules considered as explicit solvent, we have taken into account also all the solvent molecules from the pdb file free from stereochemical hindrances.

the first part of the molecular dynamics simulation is a simulated annealing , in which the motion of helices is restrained; the root-mean-square difference  for backbone atoms and sidechains between the initial model and the final structure is  <dig>  Å.

most of the water molecules that we included according to the x-ray data actually diffused into the solvent layer, with the exception of a few of them which remained inside the transmembrane bundle for the entire simulation time. these water molecules  were always close to the helical bundle due to the formation of favourable interactions with sidechains of the protein.

at the end of sa cycles, the mobility of some structural elements of the protein were considerably high, as shown by data in table  <dig> 

the structure of the protein-lipids-solvent system derived from the sa simulation was used as input for  <dig> ns of molecular dynamics .

the stability of the molecular assembly was monitored by following the total energy of the system and by the rmsd of the c-α atoms trend as a function of time as shown in the additional file: figure  <dig> and additional file: figure  <dig> .

the final picture of the protein after  <dig> ns of md is shown in figure  <dig> and in additional file: figure  <dig> . the global structure of the protein remained quite similar to the initial one, although the structural domains were unrestrained.

as expected, the tm helical domains and the els and ils regions showed markedly different dynamics behaviour, as reported in figure  <dig>  where the root mean square  fluctuations are reported versus the residue number.

among the loop regions, il <dig>  il <dig> and el <dig> were the most rigid, whereas el <dig> moved towards the tm bundle and displayed a new network of contacts. as expected, the nt and ct regions were by far the most mobile regions. the arrangement of α-helices underwent little changes during the md simulation, with the exception of tm <dig>  which showed a mobility higher than other tm domains, as showed in additional file: figure  <dig> , but its rmsd value was never higher than  <dig> Å.

to ensure that the mobility of tm <dig> was not due to a loss of the α-helix structure but was indeed due to an intrinsic property of the protein domain, results were compared with those obtained with a "trial" run, performed by applying selective harmonic restraints to the interhelical h-bond distances of tm <dig> . the need to apply local restraints to the α-helix backbone, in order to avoid a loss in secondary structure of tm <dig>  has been previously found in other rhodopsin-based homology models of gpcr  <cit> . this probably arises because gpcr models are always obtained from the rhodopsin x-ray structure, where tm <dig> is stabilized by retinal, its bound ligand. however, in a recently published paper, deflorian and co-workers reported that in their md simulations of thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor models , no restraints were required to preserve the α-helical secondary structure of the tm segments  <cit> .

comparison between md simulations, performed with and without distance restraints, showed a mobility  similar for both simulations: near to  <dig>  Å for the whole protein   and near to  <dig> Å for tm <dig> .

the number of the h-bonds observed during the md simulations and the number of residues with α-helix geometry were comparable, as reported in additional file: figure  <dig> and additional file: figure  <dig>  respectively . this suggests that the observed mobility of tm <dig> does not impair either the α-helix topology or the global packing of the helical bundle. on this basis, and due to the proved stability of the trajectory, the subsequent runs were performed without the use of any "artificial" constraints but simply employing an explicit membrane environment closer to native conditions. earlier studies have indeed shown that the mobility of α-helices embedded in membrane models is lower than the mobility of α-helices in water or methanol. for example, a simulation study of a tm alamethicin helix in a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline bilayer compared the conformational dynamics of the tm peptide with those of alamethicin in either methanol or water. it was concluded that in either the bilayer or in methanol, there was little change from the initial helical conformation of the peptide c-α rmsd, while in water there were substantial changes of rmsd accompanied by a loss in α-helix structure for some regions  <cit> . for further information about the mobility and topology of gpr <dig>  see additional file figure:  <dig>  additional file: figure  <dig> and additional file: figure  <dig> .

the architecture of the helical bundle and the organization of the most interesting helices is described in the following subchapter.

interhelical interactions
the main intermolecular contacts formed during the md run and likely contributing to receptor function are described in detail in table  <dig> and compared with those assumed to be relevant for the "parent" receptor brh and for related purinergic receptors  <cit>  . for table  <dig>  the ballesteros and weinsten numbering system has been adopted  <cit> . for time evolution plots, see additional file: figure  <dig> and additional file: figure  <dig> . we report below some of the most interesting observations emerged from this analysis.

the spanning of tm <dig> across the helical bundle seemed to divide the receptor in two well distinct regions characterized by different features. a first hydrophilic region encompassing tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> contained all the water molecules derived from crystallized brh. as in brh, starting from arg <dig> and proceeding along the whole length of the protein, multiple hydrogen/ionic interactions between tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> stabilized the helix pack. arg <dig>  asp <dig>  ser <dig>  asn <dig>  asp <dig>  asn <dig>  asp <dig>  asn <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  lys <dig>  glu <dig>  asn <dig>  lys <dig> and five water molecules  contributed to the formation of the internal polar network . in addition, ser <dig> could also interact with either wat <dig> or wat <dig>  thus participating to the continuous h-bond network described above . this residue  is conserved as a oh-bearing aminoacid in many gpcrs, including p2y and cyslt receptors. in brh, this position is occupied by alanine and the oh group is provided by a water molecule involved, together with a sodium ion, in receptor activation  <cit>  . a second hydrophobic region, where aromatic residues are predominant, encompassed tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  here, the aromatic residues tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig> and the highly conserved sub-pocket formed by phe <dig> , phe <dig>  and phe <dig>  constituted an aromatic cluster between tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  in tm <dig>  three subsequent tyrosine residues  faced the hydrophobic cavity delimited by tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the first two residues are conserved in most p2y and cyslt receptors, but not in brh, and they are probably involved in stabilization of the interhelical interactions, as suggested by our dynamics simulation.

the outmost part of tm <dig> seemed to be permanently engaged in a conserved disulphide bridge with el <dig> involving the cys <dig> and cys <dig> residues, which is an essential structural constraint for most gpcrs, as already mentioned above  <cit>  . this disulphide bridge constrained the whole structural organization of the protein. the bending of el <dig> caused the formation of a plug that shields the extracellular side of the protein from the transmembrane space. in brh, as in many other gpcrs, this plug seems to prevent the outing of embedded ligands. in p2y <dig>  the role of this disulphide bridge has been further investigated through mutagenesis data confirming its importance for receptor trafficking to the membrane  <cit> .

within tm <dig>  a ionic binding is likely to occur between asp <dig> and arg <dig>  these two charged aminoacids are positioned at the intracellular end of tm <dig>  and belong to the highly conserved d-r-y motif . in brh, the corresponding salt bridge , together with the interaction between arg <dig>  and glu <dig>  is believed to keep the receptor in its inactive state  <cit> . alignment of gpr <dig> with brh, did not reveal any corresponding acidic residue in the tm <dig> of gpr <dig>  in analogy with p2y and cyslt receptors, at position  <dig> , gpr <dig> displays a basic residue instead of an acidic one . however, we observed that, during the simulations, arg <dig> can form a stable ionic binding with the glu <dig> belonging to the ct of the protein.

as in brh, in gpr <dig>  a hydrophobic pocket formed by ala <dig> and met <dig> accommodates the asp128-arg <dig> ionic couple  of the d-r-y motif  <cit> .

an additional h-bond between arg <dig>  and a generic h-bond acceptor at position  <dig>  have been proposed for all members of the p2y12-like subfamily  <cit> . in gpr <dig>  as in the p2y <dig> subgroup of receptors, this position is occupied by a hydrophobic residue.

tm <dig> contains the h-x-x-r/k motif typical of all p2y receptors and conserved among few related receptors, including cyslt receptors . experimental data demonstrates that, in p2y <dig>  both histidine  and lysine  are essential for ligand recognition and/or receptor activation  <cit> . in particular, lys <dig>  coordinates the phosphate moiety of nucleotide ligands, while his <dig>  is probably implicated in agonist-mediated receptor activation  <cit> . in our gpr <dig> model, these two crucial residues are his <dig> and arg <dig>  the first engaged polar contacts with residues from el2; the second is the best candidate residue for nucleotide binding. experimental data from mutagenesis studies will help confirming this hypothesis.

our md simulation also showed that tm <dig> engaged only few interactions with other helices . however, as outlined above, tm <dig> contains the putative critical motifs for binding, suggesting that this helix may maintain a dynamic behaviour needed to evoke receptor activation without constraints from the other helices. in fact, in brh, tm <dig> is believed to move away from tm <dig> thereby starting the activation process  <cit> .

intracellular regions
the abundance of hydrophilic and charged residues of the intracellular domains results in the formation of a complex weave of polar interactions: this is not discussed in detail here, due to its minor relevance to the purpose of the present study.

extracellular regions
despite the length and the flexibility of the nt, we observed a pronounced structural stabilization after an initial significant conformational change. this resulted in the formation of a typical β-hairpin running nearly parallel to the horizontal plane of the membrane. this secondary structure faced a second beta strand present in el <dig>  but oriented in the opposite direction, forming a plug that is commonly believed to be critical for receptor activation mechanism  <cit> . the relative position of these two β-hairpins was strongly influenced by the presence of the disulphide bridge. despite the relatively low sequence identity between brh and gpr <dig>  this typical organization of the el <dig> and nt regions appeared to be conserved.

as for the helical domains, we report below some of the intramolecular interactions observed in the extracellular part of the protein during our md simulation.

residues from gly <dig> to leu <dig> in nt and from val <dig> to leu <dig> in el <dig> were involved in the formation of two slightly distorted β-hairpins. the sidechain of gln <dig> in el <dig> pointed toward the nt, forming a h-bond with the backbone of leu <dig> in nt, and directly connecting the two β-strands. furthermore, the backbone of gln <dig> and asn <dig> were in h-bond contact with gln <dig> in the first β-hairpin.

glu <dig> in nt was bound to asn <dig> and asn <dig> belonging to tm <dig> and tm <dig>  respectively. thr <dig> in nt was bound to ser <dig> and arg <dig> of tm <dig>  which, in turn, interacted with the peptide carbonyl of several residues located close to the extracellular end of tm <dig>  asn <dig> and ser <dig> of the β-hairpin were bound to ser <dig> and glu <dig>  respectively. gln <dig> pointed towards the interhelical space and appeared to be involved in a h-bond network running all along the helical bundle.

all the interactions reported above, together with other intra-chains interactions, form a compact, highly structured, extracellular plug encompassing both el <dig>  el <dig> and nt. this region is believed to restrain conformational changes for the resting state and control binding mechanisms during receptor activation.

all these structural evidences suggest that, in gpr <dig>  the region formed by the el <dig>  el <dig> and the nt would play a critical role in receptor activation and ligand recognition, at least as an "accessory" pocket, favouring the access of small ligands to the deeper principal binding site , in a multi-step mechanism of activation. in this context, el <dig> appears to play a minor role because of its limited length and predominant hydrophobic nature.

involvement of extracellular domains in nucleotide recognition has been suggested for the first time by moro and co-workers for p2y <dig>  these authors proposed the existence of two meta-binding sites and a path of access of the ligand to the principal intracellular binding sites  <cit> . furthermore, in p2y <dig>  some charged residues believed to be critical for receptor function in el <dig> and el <dig> have been successfully probed throughout mutagenesis combined with ligand affinity measurements  <cit> . these experiments confirmed the above hypothesis and, at the same time, support our finding and conclusions.

definition of the binding site
a general configuration of the binding sites for all known p2y receptors was proposed based on docking and mutagenesis studies  <cit> . it is commonly assumed that, in these receptors, the phosphate moiety of nucleotide ligands can be accommodated in a positively charged pocket formed by three residues. it has been also proposed that the nucleotide binding mode is specific and slightly different between the two subgroups of the family. for p2y <dig> , <dig> , <dig>  residues surrounding the phosphate chain are all located in transmembrane domains and correspond to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . in the case of p2y <dig> , <dig>  two of these three residues  belong to tm <dig> and tm <dig>  respectively; the third one is a lysine which is located in el <dig>  in the vicinity of the conserved cysteine  <cit> . at variance from this model, binding of udp-glucose to p2y <dig> has been recently reported to be quite different from that of udp to p2y <dig>  <cit> . indeed, two basic sidechains found essential for the agonist binding site in p2y <dig> and all previously known p2y receptors were not involved in p2y <dig> and are absent in the gpr <dig> sequence.

multiple alignment with p2y family members shows that gpr <dig> possesses only one of these three basic residues, in particular, residue  <dig>  corresponding to arg <dig> and belonging to the h-x-x-r motif typical of all p2y receptors. residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  correspond to gly <dig> and ser <dig>  respectively; the first residue cannot display sidechain interactions, but is able to enhance the flexibility of the chain. the role of the el <dig> has been also investigated in several p2y receptors. the lysine which is present in the el <dig> in p2y <dig> , <dig> is not conserved in gpr <dig>  but, interestingly, is conserved in cyslt <dig> 

it has been also proposed that an acidic residue, located two positions ahead of the conserved cysteine, would play an important role in ligand recognition. this critical residue is aspartic acid in p2y <dig> , <dig> and corresponds to glu <dig> in p2y <dig>  a receptor where an additional glutamic acid on el <dig>  seems to participate to the stabilization of the ligand-receptor complex.

gpr <dig> lacks the charged residues close to this conserved cysteine: the nearest ones  are shifted toward the ct end of el <dig> in the direction of tm <dig>  interestingly, glutamic acid in el <dig> is conserved as it is in cyslt receptors.

due to the relatively low identity between gpr <dig> and related receptors sharing both endogenous and synthetic ligands, sequence analysis does not provide an exact definition of ligand binding mode, despite the increasing knowledge on the arrangement of nucleotides in ligand-receptor complexes of p2y receptors. the characterization of the binding site of cysteinyl-lts are even more ill defined.

mutagenesis studies on p2y <dig> receptor suggest that residues  <dig>  and asp <dig>  are involved in the receptor activation caused by ligand binding  <cit> . the role of this pair of charged aminoacids has been postulated also for p2y <dig>  where residue  <dig>  is involved in an ionic interaction with glu <dig>  and this is crucial for the retention of receptor ground state conformation. the phosphate interaction with the sidechain of arg <dig> is supposed to destabilize the ion pair arg103-glu <dig> and this mechanism could take part in receptor activation  <cit> .

our gpr <dig> model indicates a different and specific distribution of charged residues in the area corresponding to the nucleotide binding pocket of p2y receptors suggesting that ligand-mediated activation may be different from that described for p2y <dig> . in gpr <dig>  ligand recognition  is not mediated by the interplay of a ionic couple stabilizing the reciprocal el <dig> and tm <dig> positions. the positively charged residue nearest to  <dig>  in tm <dig> of gpr <dig> is arg <dig>  which is conserved as a positively charged residue also in all p2y receptors, except for p2y <dig>  in our model, arg <dig> was likely to form stable interactions with tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> and ser <dig> sidechains.

conversely, in gpr <dig>  the putative negatively charged counterpart of the  <dig>  residue corresponds to gln <dig>  which was likely to form persistent h-bonds with tyr <dig>  ser <dig> and his <dig> 

as a conclusion, detailed architecture of interactions between tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and el <dig> showed that, in gpr <dig>  a different and specific distribution of residues could stabilize the position of el <dig> over tm domains, thus suggesting a slightly different mechanism of receptor activation .

the bound agonist and antagonist ligands
the overall picture of the agonist-receptor complex was obtained by means of md runs of  <dig> ns starting from the best-docked configuration of one of the natural ligands of gpr <dig>  i.e. udp.

in the 3-d arrangement of 7tm receptors, the binding pocket that delos  <cit>   spotted as the most probable one which best accommodates the agonist ligand corresponded to the already well documented "nucleotide binding site"  <cit> ; as expected on the basis of the poor conservation of sequences, the interatomic connections were different.

the putative arrangement of the udp molecule is displayed in figure  <dig>  a multitude of possible interactions held the diphosphate moiety in place. the guanidine group of arg <dig>  seemed to form an ionic bond with both the α and β-phosphates, with a shorter distance to the α-phosphate. furthermore, the β-phosphate seemed to form a network of h-bonds with the hydroxyl groups of tyr <dig> , tyr <dig>  and tyr <dig>  and to interact with the sidechain  of his <dig> . gln <dig>  was bound to both the α-phosphate and β-phosphates: as a consequence, gln <dig> did not seem to coordinate the three tyrosines as in the unbound receptor.

in addition to the directly bound gln <dig>  another residue belonging to el <dig>  namely gln <dig>  pointed toward the intracellular space and kept its sidechain close to the phosphate chain in the pocket. sidechains of his <dig> , tyr <dig> , ser <dig> , tyr <dig>  were also within the binding pocket. the most important interaction of the agonist phosphates seemed to occur with arg255; however, interaction with his <dig>  could be as important.

on the opposite side of the helical bundle, the uridine ring was coordinated by residues from tm <dig> and tm <dig>  namely, the 4-o of uracil was likely to interact with the hydroxyl groups of ser <dig>  and tyr <dig> , whereas its 3-nh group seemed to interact with ser <dig> . these polar interactions were the only ones present in the aromatic subsite hosting the uridine ring. mostly hydrophobic contacts were instead observed within the pocket: these involved tyr <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig>  tyr <dig>  an additional intramolecular h-bond was formed between asn <dig> in el <dig> and ser <dig> in tm <dig>  involving the oh group of serine and nh <dig> group of asparagine.

although holding some peculiar features, the overall configuration of the agonist ligand agreed with the general configuration predicted in previous computational papers for p2y receptors, including the p2y <dig> receptor that shares the common agonist udp with gpr <dig>  <cit> . analogies concern the involvement of the conserved residues ser <dig> , tyr <dig>  and phe <dig>  in the coordination of the nucleobase and the electrostatic interaction between the conserved arg <dig>  and the phosphate moiety. ser <dig>  was also involved in the binding of the uracil group of utp in p2y <dig> and p2y <dig>  in the binding of the adenine group of mrs <dig> , and, in general, of the nucleobase in p2y receptors. the same residue has also been described as essential for the activation of p2y <dig>  <cit> .

in our model, the sugar moiety of udp established only a few specific interactions with 7tm regions. the most important interaction engaged by the ribose involved the 2'-oh group of the sugar, that, during the md simulation, shifted from asn <dig>  to thr <dig> ; conversely, the 3'-oh pointed to tm <dig>  but was not directly involved in any specific h-bond. in the most representative udp structures of the whole md simulation, the ribose clustered in a southern  conformation, while the starting configuration was northern . the shift from  to  conformation seemed to proceed in parallel to the shift of the 2'-oh group of the agonist ligand from tm <dig> to tm <dig>  this allowed the ribose to assume the conformation required to hold the phosphate and the uracil groups in the proper position for a stable receptor binding. although, for gpr <dig>  further experimental investigations are necessary to confirm this issue, similar data were reported for the ribose group of udp-glucose in binding to p2y <dig>  for this receptor, the 2'-oh group was bound to asn <dig>  in the  ribose conformation or to asn <dig>  and ser <dig>  in the  conformation, while the 3'-oh group never interacted with the receptor  <cit> . in the case of p2y <dig> , <dig>  receptors, the  conformation of the pseudo-rotational cycle of the sugar enhanced the binding of adenine and uracil agonists  <cit> . in the case of p2y <dig>  the ribose group of udp established specific interactions with the tm residues and this was related to the stabilization of the final active  conformation of the ribose. this unique profile of udp binding in p2y <dig> differs from the typical  conformation of uracil  nucleotides in other p2y receptors.

we then modeled two adenine nucleotide p2y receptor antagonists that have been previously shown to interact with gpr <dig>  <cit> : mrs <dig> and cangrelor.

the ribose-modified nucleotide analogue mrs <dig>  a selective p2y <dig> receptor antagonist, binds to the same binding pocket of endogenous ligands on this receptor. in analogy with p2y <dig>  our docking experiments suggested that mrs <dig> and udp occupy a common region also on gpr <dig>  the final picture of the bound antagonist is reported in figure  <dig>  the phosphate moiety was anchored to the same arg <dig> residue that bounded to udp by electrostatic interaction, but in a middle position between the two phosphate chains, as previously described for binding of mrs <dig> to p2y <dig>  <cit> . in addition, both the 3' and 5' phosphate chains were stabilized via h-bonds with many other residues in the binding pocket. the 3'-phosphate group formed a h-bond with the sidechain  of his <dig> ; the oh group of tyr <dig>  interacted with the same oxygen atom of the 3'-phosphate group. the nh <dig> group of gln <dig>  was h-bounded to the 3'-phosphate of mrs <dig>  the 5'-phosphate group was bound to the oh groups of tyr <dig> , thr <dig>  and tyr <dig> . it is noticeable that, in the case of the antagonist, two solvent molecules  were bridging the interaction of the phosphate groups with asn <dig>  and tyr <dig> , respectively. the adenine group of mrs <dig> is likely to offer several nitrogen acceptor atoms to residues able to form h-bonds: in our model, the n <dig> was connected to arg <dig> , the n <dig> interacted with ser <dig>  , the n <dig> interacted with asn <dig>  and, finally, the n <dig> interacted with the backbone of phe <dig>  here again, the hydrophobic residues phe <dig> and phe <dig> accommodated the nucleobase.

cangrelor  is a potential anti-thrombotic agent due to its ability to counteract adp-induced activation of platelet p2y <dig> receptors responsible for platelet aggregation. cangrelor is also a potent antagonist at the p2y <dig> receptor subtype  <cit>  and, as recently reported by us, at human and rodent gpr <dig>  <cit> . its ability to potently prevent the progression of ischemic injury in a rat model of focal brain ischemia  <cit>  also highlights this compound as a potential anti-stroke agent. since no data on the binding mode of this antagonist at either p2y <dig> or p2y <dig> receptors are available, we decided to investigate its interaction with gpr <dig> by means of md simulations. the configuration of the gpr17-cangrelor complex docked in the nucleotide binding pocket after  <dig> ns of md is shown in figure  <dig> 

as in the case of udp and mrs <dig>  a main driving interaction involved the phosphate groups  and the basic arg <dig> residue. cangrelor accommodated the triphosphate chain between helices tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> and pointed to the extracellular space extending towards the el <dig> residues. due to the length of the phosphate containing chain, cangrelor conformation was more influenced by residues in extracellular loops with respect to smaller ligands, such as mrs <dig> and udp. an additional basic residue  from el <dig> was bound to the phosphate chain. furthermore, four polar residues from el <dig>  and tm <dig>  directed their sidechains towards the transmembrane region and contributed to the stabilization of the complex by forming h-bonds with the phosphate chain.

due to the anchoring of its phosphate groups from the extracellular side, cangrelor adenine moiety occupied a region between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  but its orientation in the pocket differed from that of mrs <dig>  the amino group pointed towards the extracellular side as a result, which has never been proposed for adenine nucleotides docked at the p2y receptors . in detail, the pyrimidinic ring faced tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  allowing the n <dig> and n <dig> nitrogen atoms of the ring to form h-bond interactions with tyr <dig> and arg <dig>  while the imidazole portion of the molecule was directed towards tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> and was h-bound to the gln <dig> sidechain of el <dig>  the adenine ring substituents, i.e., the  <dig> ,3-trifluoropropylsulfanyl and the 2-methylsulfanylethylamino chains elongated to a deeper region within the helical bundle and the extracellular side of the protein, respectively, thus extending to a receptor region which is inaccessible to small nucleotides such as udp and mrs <dig>  finally, the ribose moiety was positioned between tm <dig>  tm <dig>  and tm <dig>  was surrounded by tyr <dig> , tyr <dig> , his <dig> , arg <dig> , gln <dig>  and  and formed several h-bond interactions with their sidechains.

our model also revealed some important differences in the interaction of gpr <dig> with ligands' adenine moiety. according to previous modeling studies on p2y <dig>  <cit> , basic residues in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  coordinated the phosphates of adenine ligands such as mrs <dig> and related compounds. moreover, residue  <dig>  was h-bound to n <dig> and n <dig>  whereas residue  <dig>  was h-bound to n <dig>  finally, highly conserved residues in  <dig>  and  <dig>  contributed to the stabilization of the adenine ring. in the case of gpr <dig>  the  <dig>  residue is an arginine, which seemed involved in a persistent ionic interaction with a glutamic acid in  <dig> , an acidic residue which is not present in any other p2y receptors. this pair is likely to form a bridge between tm <dig> and tm <dig> close to the binding cavity, thus stabilizing the helical bundle. in gpr <dig>  another basic residue in  <dig>   replaces the  <dig>  residue facing the binding pocket which is present in the other p2y receptors. arg <dig> formed a h-bond with the adenine n <dig> of both ligands and also acted as a h-bond donor for adenine n <dig> of mrs <dig>  interestingly, in the absence of ligands, arg <dig> formed a salt bridge with asp <dig>  this pair belonged to the hydrophilic network between tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  suggesting that, in gpr <dig>  the arg <dig> residue could play a significant role in ligand-mediated activation mechanism. also in the case of gpr <dig>  for both mrs <dig> and cangrelor, our data highlighted a particularly important role for residue  <dig>  in phosphate coordination. for time evolution plots of the main interactions observed between gpr <dig> and docked ligands during md see additional file: figure  <dig>  additional file: figure  <dig> and additional file: figure  <dig> .

the network of h-bonds between gpr <dig> polar residues of tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and water remained stable throughout the md simulation.

overall, the main functional regions for receptor binding in udp, mrs <dig> and cangrelor overlapped: atoms n <dig> in uridine and n <dig> in adenine were superimposed. the 3'-phosphate group of mrs <dig> and the α-phosphate group of udp and cangrelor overlapped, while the ribose approximately occupied the same spatial regions at the centre of the helical bundle. in summary, for the natural ligand udp, the uracil ring pointed toward tm <dig> and tm <dig>  while also binding to tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the diphosphate moiety was bound to tm <dig> and tm <dig> and pointed toward tm <dig>  tm <dig> and el <dig>  for mrs <dig>  the adenine ring was bound to tm <dig> and tm <dig> and pointed toward helices tm <dig> and tm <dig>  the phosphate moiety was bound to tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and el <dig>  with the 5'-phosphate pointing towards el <dig> and the 3'-phosphate pointing towards tm <dig> and tm <dig>  finally, also for cangrelor, the adenine ring was positioned between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  while the phosphate chain was comprised between tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and extended towards el <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the dynamic simulations of a natural purinergic ligand and of two strong purinergic antagonists suggest that the agonist/antagonist binding modes to the new nucleotide receptor gpr <dig> are comparable, and that the topology of the binding site is the same. the agonistic or antagonistic nature of the different ligands cannot be determined from the analysis of the binding mode, since the binding site itself appears to be shared by both nucleotide agonists and antagonists. the binding region corresponds to the well described nucleotide binding site of the other p2y receptors, at least for some crucial interactions . some important differences were, however, noticed, since only one of the three basic residues that are typically present in the binding pocket of p2y receptors is conserved in gpr <dig>  thus, the so called "nucleotide binding site" is not defining a single binding mode and surely not a unique configuration of nucleotides bound to it. recent developments show heterogeneity in the modalities of nucleotide binding also among the already known members of the p2y receptor family  <cit> . for example, for p2y <dig>  it has been suggested that two of the basic residues  that have been previously involved in binding to nucleotide phosphates, are instead bound to the hexose moiety of sugar-nucleotides. moreover, initial docking and md experiments suggest that, in a similar way to p2y <dig>  <cit> , there may be an additional "accessory" binding site also on gpr <dig>  in a region located at the interface between the extracellular environment and the helical bundle. here, some key aminoacids in el <dig> and in nt could drive the efficacy with which small ligands are guided into the helical bundle, and could consequently affect receptor response. interestingly, in our previous gtpgammas binding studies, we noticed a marked species difference in the potency of some purinergic agonists and antagonists between the rat and human receptor  <cit> . at present, we have no obvious explanation to explain this difference. however, despite the absence of marked sequence changes between the two receptors, there are indeed qualitatively important differences in single aminoacid residues belonging to the el <dig> and nt, in the receptor region highlighted above. future mutagenesis studies guided by these species differences will help clarifying the relative importance of this receptor region in both ligand binding and receptor activation.

gpr <dig> has been also reported to bind to cysteinyl-lts  <cit> . our model suggests that neither the dimensions nor the dynamics of the receptor with or without ligands will accommodate the leukotrienic ligands in the nucleotide binding site. therefore, a first clear hint coming out from this work is that this dual receptor most probably has a dual binding mechanism, according to the chemical entity that is going to bind. based on our modeling, we hypothesise that leukotrienic ligands may extend well beyond the nucleotide binding pocket, therefore also involving the extracellular loops. this conclusion is consistent with our previous experimental data with gtpgammas binding  <cit> . in 1321n <dig> cells heterologously expressing hgpr <dig>  blockade of the cysteinyl-lt binding site with the cyslt antagonists montelukast or pranlukast did not abolish the response to uracil derivatives. in a similar way, blockade of the nucleotide binding site with either cangrelor or mrs <dig> still permitted the response to ltd <dig>  moreover, incubation with both ltd <dig> and uracil derivatives, utilized at concentrations corresponding to their ec <dig> values, resulted in an augmented response with respect to responses induced by each agonist alone  <cit> . globally, these data suggest that two distinct binding sites, or at least two binding modes , are present on gpr <dig>  we envisage that the elucidation of this second binding site for cysteinyl-lts in gpr <dig> will help designing novel "hybrid" dual antagonists of previously unexplored therapeutic potential. this could be achieved by the rational design of a dual ligand carrying structural elements from two distinct classes of ligands. this approach would also meet the requirements of the current lead-discovery strategy that aims at the development of compounds that can simultaneously target different biological pathways. this approach can be advantageous in the case of complex mechanisms of action for which the blockade of a single mechanism fails to sort the desired effect  <cit> .
