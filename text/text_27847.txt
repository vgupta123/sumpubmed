BACKGROUND
microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats, are 1- <dig> base pair  nucleotide motifs tandemly repeated in the genome of every eukaryotic organism analyzed so far. in contrast to non-repetitive dna, microsatellite polymorphism is primarily due to variation in the number of repeated motifs rather than to substitutions. a very high mutation rate - from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> mutation per microsatellite and per generation  <cit> - is usually associated with microsatellite loci, resulting in high heterozygosity and the presence of multiple alleles at a given locus  <cit> . these markers are co-dominant, abundant in non coding regions of the genome, are relatively easy to isolate, can be specifically amplified by pcr, and evolve according to mutation models that are well described  <cit> . therefore, microsatellites have emerged as the most popular and versatile neutral markers for geneticists working on a wide range of topics including, among others, forensics, genome mapping, population structure, phylogeny, linkage and kinship relationships  <cit> . the most conventional procedure for the isolation of microsatellite markers, i.e., enrichment of genomic dna for microsatellite motifs cloning, screening of the resulting library and sequencing of the positive clones  <cit> , is challenging, time-consuming and costly. such enrichment methods also generally use one or a few specific repeated motifs that are most often selected without prior knowledge of their abundance in the genome and may not produce suboptimal results. the recent availability of huge amount of sequence data for a wide range of organisms, together with new methodological developments of in silico mining of microsatellites, have tremendously increased the characterization of these markers  <cit> , and will certainly catalyze the study of genomic distribution of microsatellites in eukaryotes.

the isolation of microsatellites as useable markers appears to be more difficult in some taxa than in others, and has proved to be difficult in many invertebrates, including nematodes  <cit> . except for the model species caenorhabditis elegans, whose genome has been sequenced in the past decade  <cit> , no genome-wide survey of microsatellites is available for nematodes. in addition, there have been relatively few studies of microsatellites isolated by conventional molecular biology approaches in this phylum compared to other eukaryotes, e.g. insects or vertebrates. such unpopularity of microsatellites as genetic markers in nematodes was attributed in part to the unusually high proportion of loci that fail to produce interpretable pcr patterns, possibly as the result of inter-locus flanking sequence similarity  <cit> . the root-knot nematode  meloidogyne incognita is a serious plant parasite characterized by both its world-wide distribution and its very large host range  <cit> , which raise questions about the origin, the processes of dispersal and the resulting genetic structure of the populations. in recent years, studies of genetic diversity have been carried out in this mitotic parthenogenetic organism using neutral molecular markers such as rapd or aflp, and revealed rather unexpected levels of clonal diversity among populations  <cit> . but surprisingly, like in other nematodes, microsatellites, which are usually regarded as among the most appropriate tools to study variation at the individual level, have been very poorly investigated in this taxon.

the recent completion of genome sequencing projects has provided new opportunities to evaluate and compare the distribution of microsatellites in nematodes. besides the genome of c. elegans, additional whole-genome data are now available for nematodes with very different life styles, i.e. the necromenic species pristionchus pacificus  <cit> , the plant-parasitic species m. incognita and m. hapla  <cit> , and the animal-parasitic species brugia malayi  <cit> . based on these genomic resources, we report here the first survey and comparative analysis of microsatellites in nematodes, which reveal variable patterns of microsatellite abundance and diversity in the genomes of these organisms. a more detailed focus on the genome of the rkn m. incognita allowed the characterization of  <dig>  di- to hexanucleotide loci, providing the material basis for the future development of a wide range of microsatellite markers in this plant parasite of major agronomic importance.

RESULTS
relative abundance and diversity of microsatellites in nematode genomes
we examined the distribution of perfect 1- <dig> bp microsatellites using an optimized detection threshold of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> repeats for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide motifs, respectively. for each motif type, these are the minimum number of repeats required for a microsatellite to be reported, that have been optimized as default parameters of the software to eliminate repeats which might be observed by chance  <cit> . so the results described here apply to microsatellites meeting this criterion. accordingly, the total numbers of microsatellites found in the five nematode genomes appeared highly variable, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and covered from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the nematode genomes . when considering density and coverage of the microsatellites  in the five genomes, three homogenous groups could be defined . the first one comprised the two rkn species, m. incognita and m. hapla, which shared the lowest abundance of microsatellite loci. the second group combined c. elegans and p. pacificus, with microsatellite density and coverage values about two times higher than those of rkn. the largest values were exhibited by b. malayi . the variability of microsatellite number found in nematode genomes was well explained by genome size for m. incognita, m. hapla, c. elegans and p. pacificus , but not when b. malayi was included  .

the most common repeat motifs for each length class varied with the different nematode species considered . an and tn repeats were the most frequent motifs in three genomes , while cn and gn repeats dominated in the two others , with no obvious relation to the at-richness of the genomes . overall, n , n and n were the three most frequent dinucleotide microsatellite motifs found in any of the five genomes considered, but with a variable relative rank in each species. the n motif was particularly dominant in m. hapla and in b. malayi. all together, these three motifs comprised from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the whole set of dinucleotide microsatellites in each genome. the frequency of tri- to hexanucleotide motifs was more variable, with the list of most frequent motifs becoming quite specific for each nematode species. except for two motifs in p. pacificus n and n), all the most frequent trinucleotide motifs were at-rich, with n and n being the only common to the five nematode species. tetra- to hexanucleotide repeats were much less common in all five genomes, except tetranucleotide motifs in b. malayi, and to a lesser extent hexanucleotide motifs in c. elegans, and none of these single motifs appeared to be shared by the five nematode species. among these three length classes, only three of the most common motifs exhibited a gc content >50%, i.e. n and n in m. incognita, and n in c. elegans. it is to be noted that no such gc-rich motifs occurred among the most frequent in p. pacificus, although this genome has the highest gc content. the n telomeric-like hexanucleotide repeat  <cit>  was found abundant only in the b. malayi genome.

diversity of microsatellites in the genome of meloidogyne incognita
we further focused our study specifically on the rkn m. incognita, because it is a plant-parasitic species of major economic importance for which molecular markers suitable for population genetics are not available. using our search criteria, we could identify a repertoire of  <dig>  microsatellite loci in the genome of this nematode, represented by  <dig> different motifs that covered  <dig> % of the total genomic dna analysed. genomic location of microsatellites , motif types and motif iterations are given in the additional file  <dig>  the twenty most abundant microsatellite classes were cn, gn, n, n, tn, an, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n and n . together, they comprised  <dig> % of all microsatellites identified. although they were the most frequent , mononucleotide motifs were no longer considered in the following analyses, because they are not of interest as putative microsatellite markers. for the same reason, dinucleotide microsatellites were taken into account only when they had more than eight repeated units .

overall,  <dig> di- to hexanucleotide motifs were identified and contributed to the diversity of the microsatellite repertoire in the m. incognita genome . small number  of tandem repeats of the microsatellite motifs predominated with more than 97% of all motifs belonging to this length group. a declining trend in abundance according to the number of repetitions occurred for all motifs, except for the tetranucleotide n. interestingly, this motif also comprised the most iterated microsatellite locus, spanning  <dig> repetitions. microsatellites consisting of trinucleotide repeats were by far the most abundant, representing 80% of the di- to hexanucleotides found in the nematode genome. they were followed by tetra- and dinucleotides, at a relative frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively, while penta- and hexanucleotides appeared quite rare . five different dinucleotide motifs were identified, that were comparable in terms of frequency . conversely, the distribution was extremely variable among the  <dig> trinucleotide motifs characterised, with frequencies ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the most frequent motifs were the at-rich n and n, which collectively represented more than 41% of the total number of di- to hexanucleotides identified in the m. incognita genome. in contrast, the only motif composed solely of c and/or g, n, was very poorly represented . overall, a total of  <dig> microsatellites  exhibited a large number of repeated motifs .

distribution of microsatellites in the coding regions of the genome of meloidogyne incognita and gene ontology annotation
among the  <dig>  predicted protein-coding loci  searched, a total of  <dig>  microsatellites were identified in  <dig> cds, including  <dig> cds containing at least two microsatellites . they represent  <dig> % of the total number of microsatellite loci found in the whole genome of this nematode. overall, the distribution density of microsatellites is  <dig>  per mb of coding sequence. the occurrence of the repeat motifs found is shown in figure 2a. only mono-, di- and trinucleotide motifs were observed, this last category representing more than 99% of the total set of microsatellites. with  <dig> % of repeat motifs, n turned out to be the most frequent microsatellite, followed by n , n  and n . among trinucleotide motifs, gc-rich microsatellites represented  <dig> % only of the total number of loci. we further investigated the frequency of the amino-acid repeats  encoded by the tri-nucleotide repeats in the cds . the ten different amino acids that composed the aar identified were, from the most to the least frequent, asparagine , lysine , threonine , arginine , serine , isoleucine , proline , leucine , glycine  and valine . the longest aar encoded by trinucleotide motifs was observed for asn with  <dig> repeats.

when scanned for interpro domains,  <dig> out of the  <dig> cds  containing at least one microsatellite motif were found to harbour at least one known domain , and were further assigned a corresponding gene ontology  term. overall, cellular component, molecular function and biological process go terms could be assigned to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cds, respectively. for each go category, the relative distribution of go terms is represented in figure  <dig>  with regard to the cellular component category,  <dig> % of the cds were assigned a nucleus go term, followed by the cell  and the membrane  categories. conversely, the extracellular  and extracellular matrix  go terms were poorly represented. macromolecule metabolism  was the most frequent go term for cds in the biological process category, just followed by regulation of biological process  and cellular process . notably, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the annotated cds were assigned a secretion and response to stimulus go term, respectively. when the molecular function category was considered, binding go term was over-represented , followed by transferase  and hydrolase  activities.

discussion
diversity of microsatellite distribution in nematode genomes
in this study, we used msatfinder  <cit>  to scan the recently assembled m. incognita, m. hapla, b. malayi and p. pacificus genomes for perfect microsatellites of 1- <dig> bp long. to validate our results, we performed a similar analysis of the c. elegans genome using the same bioinformatics tool and search parameters. the coverage of microsatellite loci in c. elegans has previously been estimated at  <dig> bp/per mbp  <cit> , and we were encouraged in that our results are consistent with those previously reported for this nematode . indeed, such a consistency between two independent studies may be considered as a strong indication of the robustness of the global analysis.

it has long been considered that the structure and organization of the c. elegans genome would serve as accurate model for most nematodes  <cit> . previous comparative studies of model eukaryotes have shown that c. elegans has the lowest frequency and coverage of microsatellites in its genome, even less than saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungi  <cit> . our own analysis reveals a huge variation among the five nematode genomes investigated in terms of both coverage and density of microsatellites, that is independent from the size of the genomes considered. while p. pacificus has similar microsatellite density and coverage than c. elegans, the two rkn species, m. hapla and m. incognita, both exhibit a twofold lower abundance of microsatellite loci. conversely, the animal parasite b. malayi contains five times more microsatellites/mbp than c. elegans. phylogenetic relationships within the nematoda phylum have been considered to tentatively explain such variability. based on small subunit ribosomal dna sequences, the phylogeny of nematodes identifies five major clades in the phylum  <cit> . in this framework, c. elegans and p. pristionchus belong to clade v, m. incognita and m. hapla belong to clade iv, and b. malayi belong to clade iii, respectively. although a loose correlation may be seen here, additional data from many other nematode species from all five clades are required before considering any hypothetical relationship between the clade of origin and the density of microsatellites for a given species. clearly, these data provide evidence of variable patterns of microsatellite distribution in nematode genomes, indicating that the particular contribution of these shorts tandem repeats to the genome of c. elegans may not be the rule for other nematodes.

without taking into account mononucleotide repeats, it is generally reported that dinucleotides are the most common microsatellites in many organisms  <cit> . here, dinucleotides appeared significantly underrepresented in both rkn species, with as few as  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total number of microsatellites in m. hapla and m. incognita, respectively. conversely, trinucleotides were overrepresented in both the two latter species compared to c. elegans, p. pacificus and above all b. malayi. such a distribution bias in favour of trinucleotides has been reported for some other eukaryotes, e.g., the fungus neurospora crassa  <cit>  or the insect tribolium castaneum  <cit> . also, a recent data-mining analysis of ests from phytoparasitic nematodes, including some rkn species, showed that trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant microsatellites in coding ests  <cit> .

data-mining of  <dig> completed genomes showed that microsatellites with low gc content are predominant in most eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . this trend also emerged from our survey, with the majority of the most frequent 1- <dig> bp microsatellite motifs from nematodes being at-rich. however, one notable exception was constituted by polyg/polyc mononucleotide repeats in m. incognita and p. pacificus. conversely, none of the most frequent di- to hexanucleotide repeats contains exclusively cs or gs. among nematode dinucleotides, n motifs seem to be predominant compared with other motifs, while n were extremely rare, and even absent in the two rkn species. n motifs, which are the most abundant dinucleotides in insects  <cit>  and other invertebrates  <cit> , were also frequently detected in nematode genomes. in the same way, trinucleotides were dominated by at-rich motifs, with n and n being always present in the four most common motifs in the five species investigated. the only exceptions were n and n, which were frequently detected in the p. pacificus genome. at-richness was further exhibited by tetra- to hexanucleotides, with some remarkable exceptions, i.e., n and n in m. incognita, or  n in c. elegans. overall, the diversity of microsatellite motifs gave each of the five nematode species a unique pattern of repeat distribution, even in the case of the two related rkn species tested here, suggesting that they can be efficient at differentiating those species.

microsatellites in the protein-coding sequences of meloidogyne incognita
a total of  <dig>  perfect microsatellites have been identified from the whole m. incognita cds dataset, i.e.,  <dig> % of protein-coding sequences possess such repeats. the vast majority  of them are trinucleotide repeats. this result confirms a recent report indicating that trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant microsatellites in coding ests from  <dig> species of plant-parasitic nematodes belonging to seven genera, including meloidogyne  <cit> . moreover, in agreement with these authors, we found that n repeats were the most abundant in m. incognita cds, while n or n, that could act as start or stop codon, respectively, were not detected. the proportion of trinucleotide repeats in m. incognita cds exponentially decreased as the number of repeats increased, with  <dig> repeats being a critical threshold. it is hypothesized that longer repeats are eliminated by selection acting on the nematode genome, since long amino acid repeats may have detrimental effects on protein functions  <cit> . in addition, our data showed that the hydrophilic amino acid asn, and to a lesser extent lys and arg, are over-represented among the runs of amino acids in m. incognita proteins, which is consistent with the observation that stretches of hydrophilic amino acid are more tolerated in proteins  <cit> .

a broad range of functions have been ascribed to amino acid repeats in proteins, including roles in intracellular protein-protein interactions, binding to host-cell receptors and polymerisation of their associated, non-repeated domains  <cit> . in parasitic eukaryotes such as trypanosoma brucei or plasmodium falciparum, protein repeats are often implicated in antigenic recognition and evasion of the host immune response to infection  <cit> . mining the m. incognita predicted proteome revealed a set of  <dig> proteins containing stretches of amino acid repeats, of which  <dig> had at least one interpro domain assigned, thus illustrating the importance of these peculiar structures in parasitic nematodes too. in addition, go annotation revealed that binding was the molecular function preferentially assigned to these proteins. based on the hypothesis that amino acid repeats can mediate interactions between the parasite and its host, and thus could potentially have a role in pathogenicity  <cit> , a similar role for  these proteins identified in m. incognita may be proposed. from this point of view, our analysis generated a large set of candidate proteins for further functional analysis in relation to pathogenicity in plant nematodes.

microsatellites as genetic markers in meloidogyne incognita
due to the relatively small size of nematode genomes, and the high impact of many parasitic species on animal/human health or agricultural production, one of the expected outputs of nematode genome projects is the development of reliable and informative molecular markers usable as genotyping tools in population studies. among the nematode species included in this work, and except for the model organism c. elegans, microsatellite markers have been very poorly developed, and their practical application has been limited. thus, a significant output of the present survey has been the identification of a wealth of microsatellite motifs in each of the nematode genomes analyzed. in the case of plant-parasitic nematodes, population genetics studies based on the use on polymorphic microsatellite markers are very scarce. they mainly concern the cyst nematodes globodera pallida  <cit>  and heterodera schachtii  <cit> , as well as the pinewood nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus  <cit> , the reniform nematode rotylenchulus reniformis  <cit>  and the dagger nematode xiphinema index  <cit> . conversely, because of the lack of microsatellite markers available, no such study has been developed on m. incognita, although this species has been considered as 'the world's most damaging plant pathogen'  <cit> . indeed, only one microsatellite locus had been characterized so far in rkn, i.e. in m. artiellia, a species assumed to reproduce both by amphimixy and facultative meiotic parthenogenesis  <cit> . the present study, with a total of  <dig>  di- to hexanucleotide loci identified in the genome of m. incognita, now opens new perspectives for the development of a wide range of microsatellite markers in this nematode. moreover, it provides useful information about possible physical linkage between microsatellite loci and identifies markers located in coding regions that may not be considered as neutral.

from a more general point of view, the microsatellites identified in this study may be useful for linkage analysis in the context of genetic mapping. although not available for the parthenogenetic rkn m. incognita, genetic maps have been extensively developed in many nematode species, including m. hapla  <cit> , c. elegans  <cit>  and p. pacificus  <cit>  and should benefit from the input of large batches of new markers. additionaly, in the two latter species, location of microsatellites on sex chromosomes may be of further help for kinship analysis. to our knowledge, only one study reported the genome-wide chromosomal location of microsatellites in c. elegans, with no significant distorsion in frequency and distribution on the x chromosome compared to autosomes  <cit> . conversely, no such information can be provided for rkns, due to the lack of sex chromosomes in these species, where sex determinism is under environmental epigenetic control  <cit> . however, microsatellite loci could be located on the  <dig>  contigs resulting from the genome assembly of the nematode  <cit> , and this information has been obtained for the  <dig>  microsatellite loci presently identified.

because of its negligible cost, in silico mining of microsatellites makes this approach more comfortable than bench screening of genomic libraries. although further experimental work is needed to setup pcr protocols and select the polymorphic loci that will become usable as genetic markers, recent genetic mapping or dna fingerprinting studies demonstrated the success of this strategy  <cit> . for example, in the insect t. castaneum,  <dig> new polymorphic markers were experimentally validated from  <dig>  loci identified by a bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . of the  <dig>  di- to hexanucleotide microsatellite sequences discovered in m. incognita,  <dig>  had sufficient flanking sequences to allow the design of primer pairs. these data, including primer sequences, may become useful for developing variable markers in m. incognita.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of microsatellites in completely sequenced nematode genomes provides a snapshot of the differential coverage and density of 1- <dig> bp repeats among the five species investigated. in particular, the two rkn species, m. hapla and m. incognita, both exhibit a two times lower abundance of microsatellite loci than c. elegans, which was previously considered as containing the lowest frequency of microsatellites among  eukaryotes. quite surprisingly, dinucleotide motifs appeared underepresented in the two rkn species compared to the other nematode genomes, while trinucleotides were equally overrepresented in the two latter species compared to c. elegans, p. pacificus and b. malayi. the focus on m. incognita led to the identification of  <dig>  microsatellites,  <dig>  of them being a priori suitable to design markers for population genetics. interestingly,  <dig> % of the detected microsatellites were located in coding regions, almost all being short  trinucleotide motifs. this result suggests that microsatellites may affect evolution of proteins structure and function in this species.

the nucleotide sequences of the microsatellite loci obtained in this work, together with their flanking regions and amplification primers, are available for the five nematode species, upon request to the authors. undoubtedly, this information may become useful for the development of large sets of markers that should in turn allow linkage mapping studies and facilitate population genetic research on nematodes.
