BACKGROUND
transcription factors are proteins that regulate an organism's genetic program by binding to specific sites in the genome and modifying the expression of nearby genes. mapping these sites is an important step in understanding transcriptional regulation, and can be significantly facilitated by integrating multiple data sources such as sequence, gene annotations, and phylogenetic conservation  <cit> . a previously published study  <cit>  reported an initial regulatory map for saccharomyces cerevisiae by analyzing genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation  data for  <dig> proteins. harbison and co-workers used motif discovery programs in an effort to detect statistically over-represented sequence patterns  in the bound regions that were likely to correspond to the binding specificity of the immunoprecipitated proteins. applying six different algorithms, they identified thousands of motifs. after extensive filtering and statistical testing, they reported high-confidence results for sixty-five proteins. they used these high-confidence motifs to identify sites that were in regions bound by the corresponding protein and that were conserved across at least  <dig> yeast species. we wished to expand and refine the yeast regulatory map by using a more sophisticated incorporation of phylogenetic conservation information.

recently, many authors have reported algorithms for motif discovery that use evolutionary conservation. kellis et al. presented a computational method involving the genome-wide discovery of a catalogue of conserved motifs, which they annotated by searching for overrepresented functional categories among the genes with each motif  <cit> . several programs use an expectation maximization-based search over a probability model of dna sequence to find conserved motifs. emnem  <cit>  and phyme  <cit>  both incorporate probabilistic evolutionary models into em-based motif searches. several other approaches to using conservation information in motif discovery use gibbs sampling to sample a probability space and search for motifs. compareprospector is a gibbs sampling algorithm that uses a pre-computed score to measure the conservation level across windows in sequence alignments, and then biases the motif search to regions that are highly conserved  <cit> . phylogibbs is another conservation-based gibbs sampling algorithm that leverages conservation by assuming the motif must be present in all species in a conserved region  <cit> . recently, another gibbs sampler was developed to incorporate phylogenetic data by employing two substitution matrices for motif instances and background sites, with the background model estimated from orthologous sequence alignments and the motif model assuming half the branch length of the background model  <cit> . all these algorithms have been demonstrated, in certain contexts, to outperform similar methods that don't take advantage of conservation information.

tompa and co-workers  <cit> , who recently assessed a number of motif discovery programs, demonstrated that these algorithms perform much better on synthetic data than on real data. their results highlight the importance of evaluating algorithms using experimental datasets such as those of harbison et al. using motif discovery programs to identify the specificity of proteins from experimental data is particularly challenging because there are many statistically significant motifs in such data, and no guarantee that a motif that corresponds to a factor's specificity will be highly ranked, or even discovered. harbison et al., who used six separate motif discovery programs, observed that each motif discovery program found the correct motif for at least one protein that was not found by the other methods. however, no single program demonstrated a clear superiority . their analysis provides a useful benchmark for evaluating motif discovery approaches on experimental data.

in this study, we report two improved algorithms for conservation-based motif discovery, converge and phylocon, and we use these methods to reanalyze the data of harbison et al. using statistical tests identical to the ones used by harbison et al, we find that converge and phylocon each identify more correct motifs than were found using the combined results of the six programs employed in the earlier study. the motifs discovered by converge and phylocon are often complementary. combining these motifs, we were able to significantly expand the map of yeast regulatory sites without the need to alter any of the thresholds for statistical significance. the new map reveals a more elaborate and complex view of the yeast genetic regulatory network than was observed previously. the updated map can be viewed and downloaded from the authors' website  <cit> .

RESULTS
algorithmic overview and improvements
phylocon and converge are both designed to find evolutionarily conserved motifs among a set of genes that are believed to be co-regulated. these two programs use different inputs, search algorithms and scoring statistics. phylocon  <cit>  begins with unaligned sequences and generates many local alignments from each orthologous group. the local alignments are assembled using a greedy algorithm to identify patterns that are both conserved in orthologous genes and present in many of the co-regulated promoters. by contrast, converge  <cit>  searches over pre-computed, static alignments. converge is based on an expectation-maximization  algorithm  <cit>  that has been modified to include conservation in the joint probability model. converge motifs are scored by comparing the frequency of matching sequences in the bound and not-bound genes using a hypergeometric distribution. the previously published version of phylocon scores sequences using the allr statistic  <cit> , which measures the relative likelihood that a sequence would emerge from the motif model and the background sequence model .

we made several modifications to the previously published phylocon and converge algorithms for this study . the most important modification for converge was the introduction of a phylogenetic model that allows for different evolutionary distances between each species and the primary genome . we modified the core em algorithm to dynamically adjust these distances during motif discovery. thus, converge simultaneously discovers motifs and their evolutionary history, and it is able to detect cases where the sets of genes bound by a particular regulator have diverged in the species being studied. to improve the performance of phylocon, we introduced a new scoring statistic, the total log likelihood ratio . this score limits the overfitting of phylocon motifs to datasets that are expected to contain a significant number of false positives.

motif discovery performance
phylocon and converge each showed significantly better performance than the combined results from the six programs used in harbison et al.  <cit> . using the same approach as that study, we scored the motifs produced by each program using empirical p-values. the top-ranked motif from each program was accepted as the predicted specificity for the corresponding protein if it had a p-value <  <dig> . we assessed the performance of phylocon and converge using a set of  <dig> yeast transcription factors for which the specificity has been reported in the literature . in harbison et al., the predicted specificities derived from a combination of six programs matched the known specificities for  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins . by contrast, phylocon produced  <dig> true positives  and  <dig> false positives , and converge found  <dig> true positives  and  <dig> false positives . phylocon and converge were unable to find statistically significant motifs for  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these factors respectively .

combining results from phylocon and converge allowed us to expand the set of discovered motifs without significantly degrading performance for the factors with known specificities. the number of true positives increases to  <dig> , with  <dig> false positives ,  <dig> true negatives , and  <dig> false negatives. .

updated catalog of yeast factor specificities
combining the results from two conservation-based motif discovery programs allowed us to significantly increase the number of transcription factors for which we could predict binding specificities with high-confidence. of the  <dig> factors investigated , we discovered statistically significant motifs  for  <dig> factors,  <dig> of which had experimentally determined specificities reported in the literature. the combined results of phylocon and converge discover  <dig> more motifs than were found by harbison and co-workers, who used the same strict selection criteria. of the  <dig> motifs,  <dig> were discovered by both programs,  <dig> were found only by phylocon, and  <dig> were discovered only by converge. in some of the cases where no motif was found but the protein had a known specificity, the input sequences contained few regions that matched that specificity. in other cases, very few probes had been bound by the protein. the discovered motifs were augmented with  <dig> factor specificities from the literature, to produce a final catalogue of  <dig> yeast transcription factor binding specificities. the complete list of discovered motifs is provided in additional file  <dig>  and several examples are shown in figure  <dig>  in some cases, the new motifs differ substantially from the motifs reported in harbison et al. for example the specificity discovered previously for pho <dig> was sgtgcgsygyg. our analysis predicts a specificity of aytaar. the new motif is more consistent with the results of gel shift and dnase footprint analysis  <cit>  and with the fact that that pho <dig> encodes a homeodomain protein  <cit> , a class of transcription factors that tend to bind to at-rich sequences. the factor dal <dig> is now predicted to have a specificity of aaanwtgyg, consistent with previously reported experimental evidence  <cit> . the motif reported in harbison et al.  is likely to represent the binding specificities of gln <dig>  gat <dig>  and dal <dig>  which are known to co-regulate allophanate/oxalurate-dependent genes along with dal <dig>  <cit> . no motif was previously reported for the zinc cluster protein ydr520c. the motif that we discover contains a palindromic cgg repeat, consistent with the expected specificity for a zinc cluster protein  <cit> .

an updated regulatory map for yeast
using the new catalogue of yeast specificities, we are able to build a more complete and comprehensive regulatory map for saccharomyces cerevisiae. we scanned the s. cerevisiae genome for putative regulatory interactions using our updated motif catalogue and the same criteria used by harbison et al. as in that study, we restrict our analysis to the highest confidence sites, defined as those containing conserved motif matches that were bound by the corresponding factor at a p-value <  <dig> . the new map contains a total of  <dig> conserved and bound motif sites across  <dig> genes, compared to the  <dig> sites across  <dig> genes in harbison et al. the new and the old sets of motifs have similar information content , suggesting that this increase is not due to an overall loosening of the specificity estimates. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> show the change in the number of bound genes by factor between the new and old maps. the net gain in the number of putative regulatory interactions between transcription factors and proteins is  <dig>  with  <dig> of these accounted for by new binding specificity estimates for  <dig> factors that had no previously reported motif.

the improved motifs reveal regulatory interactions for a number of transcription factors that are consistent with their known functions. for example, the refined motif for msn <dig> detects regulatory sites in  <dig> genes that were not detected in the previous study. msn <dig> is known to function in the transcriptional response to stress  <cit> . of the newly identified targets, there is a significant  over-representation of genes with the go annotation "stress-response". similarly, the refined xbp <dig> motif results in a gain of  <dig> regulatory interactions. the new targets are enriched at a p-value <  <dig>  for genes with the go annotation "morphogenesis", consistent with a previously reported regulatory role for this transcription factor  <cit> .

the revised map also provides new insights into the regulatory roles of several transcription factors. for example, the revised motif for hap <dig> reveals that this transcription factor has an extensive role in regulating synthesis of ergosterol, a fungal-specific pathway that is a target for anti-fungal drugs. the previous map revealed regulatory interactions of hap <dig> with genes for the ergosterol biosynthetic enzymes erg <dig>  erg <dig> and erg <dig>  in the new map, we find interactions with genes for six additional enzymes in this pathway: erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  erg <dig>  faa <dig>  and hmg <dig>  in addition, the new map details an expanded role for hap <dig> in regulating expression of components of the electron transport chain. regulatory interactions with genes for two components of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, cox <dig> and cox <dig>  were added to the three already present . a regulatory interaction with the gene for qcr <dig>  a component of ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase, was added to the previously reported interaction with the gene for cor <dig>  also a member of this complex. finally, a hap <dig> regulatory interaction with cytochrome c isoform  <dig>  cyc <dig>  was added to previously discovered interactions with genes for three other cytochromes, cyc <dig>  cyb <dig>  and cyt <dig>  in the old regulatory code.

network analysis
we examined the network of regulatory interactions between transcription factors in order to understand the system-level implications of our improved map. the previously reported regulatory code and the revised code were used to generate interaction networks for all the yeast transcription factors . the new map results in a striking increase in the complexity of the yeast regulatory network. thirty-nine new interactions are reported in the network, with six interactions lost from the previous version. we searched this network for occurrences of six regulatory network motifs: autoregulation, feed-forward regulation, multi-component loops, single-input, multi-input, and regulatory chains, as described in  <cit> . table  <dig> lists the number of each regulatory motif in the new and old networks. there is an increase in the number of all six regulatory motif types, with a particularly striking increase in the number of regulatory chain motifs, owing to the motif's combinatorial dependence on the total number of interactions in the network. the overall picture that emerges from this analysis is of a more complex interplay of transcription factor influences in yeast regulatory networks than could be deduced from the previously reported regulatory code.

the network based on the new map reveals several cases of feedback regulation that were not present in the previous version. the regulators arg <dig>  rox <dig>  sut <dig>  and zap <dig> are all found to have an autoregulatory interaction in the new map. of these, rox <dig>  <cit>  and zap <dig>  <cit>  have been previously shown to regulate their own expression. the map also contains evidence of enhanced roles for a number of factors in the yeast transcriptional regulatory network. with its updated specificity, yap <dig> now appears to act as a regulatory hub, displaying five new interactions with transcription factors, three of which  are involved in pseudohyphal differentiation  <cit> . the stress-induced factor xbp <dig>  previously implicated in cell-cycle function  <cit> , now displays interactions with the pseudohyphal determinant phd <dig>  and smp <dig>  a factor required for cell viability in the stationary phase  <cit> .

complementarity of motif discovery programs
phylocon and converge each find motifs that are missed by the other program. this complementarity arises from differences between the programs in  optimization criteria and  underlying evolutionary assumptions.

optimization criteria
the programs search for motifs that maximize different metrics: the enrichment and allr scores . as a result, motifs judged significant by one program can be ranked poorly by the other. in  <dig> of the  <dig> cases where the correct motif was discovered solely by phylocon, converge found the same motif, but with a poor enrichment score. similarly, of the  <dig> correct motifs reported only by converge, seven were also discovered by phylocon but only with allr scores at significance level p <  <dig> , and five more were discovered at significance level p <  <dig> .

evolutionary assumptions
phylocon dynamically realigns orthologous sequences, making no assumptions regarding the relative location of binding sites. however, it assumes that the sequences from each species should contribute equally to motif discovery. converge, by contrast, assumes that the position of binding sites will be aligned in the orthologous sequences, but it makes no assumptions about the importance of the sequences from each species.

the consequences of these differing assumptions can be seen by examining the results for xbp <dig> and rds <dig>  the xbp <dig> motif is present in 53% of the s. bayanus sequences orthologous to the bound s. cerevisiae probes, but only 27% of the s. cerevisiae motif matches align with a match in s. bayanus. by dynamically realigning the orthologous sequences, phylocon discovers the xbp <dig> motif, while converge is unable to learn the correct specificity. in the case of rds <dig>  the situation is reversed: converge finds the motif, while phylocon does not. in this case, converge determines that there is a very low probability that a match to the rds <dig> motif will occur in s. bayanus in positions that contain the motif in s. cerevisiae. the converge parameter θk, which measures the genome-wide probability of observing a motif in aligned genome k when it is present in the primary genome, falls to  <dig>  . as a result, the s. bayanus sequences have almost no influence on the discovered motif. it is worth noting that the rds <dig> protein from s. bayanus is only 32% identical to its s. cerevisiae ortholog, compared to approximately 72% for other transcription factors in these two species. these data suggest that in s. bayanus rds <dig> does not regulate the orthologs of the genes that are bound by rds <dig> in s. cerevisiae, and that both the protein and its former binding sites have evolved.

discussion
in this study we have demonstrated, on a large scale and with real data, how the use of phylogenetic conservation information can improve the ability to learn transcription factor binding specificities and paint a more detailed picture of gene regulation in yeast. in harbison et al., the authors presented a first draft of the regulatory code for a eukaryotic organism and speculated that future revisions might arise out of the collection and analysis of new experimental data, or through the use of new computational algorithms that integrate different data sources. in this work we have presented a revised regulatory code by combining the results of two complementary algorithms that integrate sequence and conservation data to discover sequence motifs. the resulting map provides a broader picture of regulatory programs in yeast.

using motif discovery algorithms to discover the specificity of transcription factors from experimental data is a challenging problem. the data of harbison et al. are particularly useful for evaluating how motif discovery algorithms perform for this purpose. aside from the original study and our current results, we are aware of only one other paper that has attempted to identify binding specificities from these data. li and wong reported a conservation-based motif discovery program, which they refer to as a tree sampler, that they applied to many of the same datasets that are all included in our analysis  <cit> . we compared our results to the published results of li and wong, which we downloaded directly from their publication . applying the same criteria to the results of all three programs, we find that tree sampler identified correct motifs in  <dig> of the  <dig>  cases reported, while phylocon identified  <dig> of these motifs , and converge correctly identified  <dig> . we note that in their paper li and wong report worse results for phylocon than we obtained. the differences may be due to the fact that they used an earlier version of phylocon or ran it with non-optimal parameters.

a sound and principled use of conservation information allowed both phylocon and converge to perform well on these data. both programs outperformed the tree sampler and they each recovered more known factor binding specificities than a suite of six other programs combined. phylocon and converge use complementary approaches to incorporate phylogenetic conservation information into motif discovery. converge reduces its search space by assuming that alignments are high quality and static, whereas phylocon makes no such assumption and dynamically aligns orthologous sequences. converge weights each genome differently and learns these weightings during motif discovery, whereas phylocon weights all orthologous sequences equally. finally, phylocon searches for motifs by optimizing the allr score, whereas converge selects em starting points, and evaluates the resulting motifs using a hypergeometric enrichment score. because of these differences, each program finds some motifs that are missed by the other one. combining the results of these programs leads to a significant elaboration of the yeast regulatory code.

there is increasing interest in using motif discovery algorithms to discover the binding specificity of proteins from high-throughput data. however, it is important to recognize the limitations of these methods, which rely largely on statistical criteria. for example, some proteins are known to bind dna indirectly through interactions with other proteins. gal <dig> is an inhibitor of gal <dig> that binds the gal <dig> protein and lacks a dna-binding domain. the chip-chip data reveal that they have many common targets. our motif discovery algorithms identify the known gal <dig> motif as the specificity of both proteins. given the known physical interactions of gal <dig> and gal <dig>  these data imply that gal <dig> is directed to its targets indirectly through its association with gal <dig>  similarly, gcr <dig>  which is known to act together with gcr <dig> to regulate glycolysis genes  <cit> , has a newly reported specificity that matches the known specificity of gcr <dig>  suggesting that gcr <dig> may be recruited to the dna through interactions with gcr <dig>  additional sources of biological data will need to be incorporated into algorithms to determine whether a motif represents the specificity of a protein or an interacting factor.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated a practical approach to analyzing experimental data by combining two complementary motif discovery programs that use phylogenetic conservation. we anticipate that progress in mapping the architecture of regulatory programs in eukaryotes will arise from a more thorough understanding of the relative merits of various approaches to motif discovery, as well as algorithmic developments in integrating various data sources. algorithms that make use of phylogenetic conservation, factor homology, positional information, and other prior information sources will become more and more important as we attempt to apply motif discovery methods to higher eukaryotes. however, since no algorithmic approach to motif discovery has demonstrated a clear superiority across all applications, it will become equally important to integrate various motif discovery methods in a more intelligent manner  <cit> . ultimately, unraveling the regulatory code of higher eukaryotes may be greatly facilitated by a 'mixture of experts' approach to motif discovery that uses the output of multiple algorithms, each intelligently integrating various data sources in unique ways, to generate consensus binding motifs for a factor of interest.
