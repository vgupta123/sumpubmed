BACKGROUND
flatworms represent a group with more than  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes sequenced at present and thus it could be assumed that the group is well sampled. however, previous sampling strategies have focussed on the parasitic neodermata and have not been comprehensive in free-living  flatworms. in particular,  <dig> mitochondrial genomes are available from the neodermata, and only  <dig> from free-living flatworms: four species of polycladida  <cit>  and  <dig> species of tricladida , covering  <dig> of  <dig> recognised turbellarian orders . recent phylogenomic studies have shown that the catenulida and macrostomorpha are the earliest branching taxa of platyhelminthes  <cit> , but only a relatively short mitochondrial genome fragment  from microstomum lineare  has been characterised  <cit>  from either of these two groups.fig.  <dig>  phylogenetic tree of platyhelminthes with gastrotricha as sister group reconstructed from several sources  <cit> . squares with grey background indicate the number of species with published mitochondrial genomes in the respective taxon. pink background indicates newly sequenced species in this study.  mitochondrial gene orders representative for the taxa displayed on the phylogenetic tree on the left. only ribosomal and protein-coding genes are considered. colours follow the widely conserved gene cartridges indicated by mwinyi et al.  <cit> . putative lophotrochozoan ground pattern after bernt et al.  <cit> . possible gastrotrich ground pattern with the single sequenced species, lepidodermella squamata  <cit> . possible catenulid ground pattern with the single newly sequenced species, stenostomum sthenum. duplicated genes in red, transcription from the minus strand is indicated by rectangle outlined in red. possible macrostomorphan ground pattern with the single complete newly sequenced species, macrostomum lignano. possible polyclad ground pattern represented by prosthiostomum siphunculus  <cit> . triclad ground pattern after several sources . neodermatan ground patterns after wey-fabrizius et al.  <cit> . putative flatworm ground pattern calculated with treerex 




until recently, the gene order of platyhelminthes was considered to be highly conserved, with few exceptions  <cit> . this notion was largely influenced by taxonomically biased sampling, as only a single complete mitochondrial genome of a free-living flatworm, dugesia japonica  <cit> , was available. when the first mitochondrial genomes of polyclads became available, a third gene order pattern within flatworms was identified  <cit> .

all previously published free-living flatworm mitogenomes represent large species, which imposes a further sampling bias. here, we provide the first mitochondrial genomes from microscopic turbellarians representing the orders catenulida and macrostomorpha to shed light on the ground plan of mitochondrial genomes in platyhelminthes. stenostomum sthenum is a freshwater species from a genus with a worldwide distribution, and which predominantly reproduces asexually by fission  <cit> . the marine species macrostomum lignano is considered a model organism whose genome has recently been sequenced  <cit> .

RESULTS
assemblies and tandem repeats
bioinformatic assembly delivered mitochondrial genomes with an average coverage of  <dig> ×  in stenostomum sthenum, and 440×  in macrostomum lignano.

the mitochondrial genome assembly of s. sthenum revealed an inverted region of  <dig>  bp length, which is otherwise identical to its non-inverted counterpart . the bioinformatically predicted flanking regions of the duplicated region were confirmed by sequencing several different pcr products. no tandem repeats were detected in the mitochondrial genome of s. sthenum.fig.  <dig> circular mitochondrial genome of stenostomum sthenum. outermost circle displays logarithmically mapped rnaseq reads. red lines below represent sequenced amplicons from pcr experiments. bold line in innermost circle indicates transcription from the minus strand. trna genes are abbreviated with single capital letter and a number if applicable. colours indicate the widely conserved gene cartridges proposed by mwinyi et al.  <cit> . dark grey colour indicates an overlap between genes. unlabeled and uncoloured regions are intergenic spacers. pictured is an adult specimen of s. sthenum with three zooids, anterior is to the right




the assembled mitogenome of m. lignano  was compared to the published genome assembly  <cit> , and a matching contig of  <dig>  bp length  with non-overlapping ends was detected. this contig allowed us to determine the length and sequence of a tandem repeat region consisting of eight 61 bp repeats. the sequence of the repeat units is ggggggaataaatattcccccctatattactaatgtaatataaggagaaatataatatata . the  <dig>  bp long genome contig showed a leading  <dig> sequence in repeats # <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but pcr verification suggested that all  <dig> repeats have a leading  <dig> sequence.fig.  <dig> circular mitochondrial genome of macrostomum lignano. outermost circle displays logarithmically mapped rnaseq reads. red line below represents sequenced amplicons from pcr experiments. trna genes are abbreviated with single capital letter and a number if applicable. colours indicate the widely conserved gene cartridges proposed by mwinyi et al.  <cit> . dark grey colour indicates an overlap between genes. unlabeled and uncoloured regions are intergenic spacers. pictured is an adult specimen of m. lignano, anterior is to the right




tandemly repeated elements are common in the mitochondrial genomes of flatworms, and a re-analysis of the published mitochondrial genome of prosthiostomum siphunculus  <cit>  revealed several large, previously undetected overlapping tandem repeats  in an intergenic region.

rnaseq read mapping on assembled mitochondrial genomes
we logarithmically mapped  <dig>  million rnaseq reads onto the mitochondrial genome of s. sthenum with an average coverage of  <dig> × . for m. lignano,  <dig>  million rnaseq reads mapped onto the mitochondrial genome with an average coverage of  <dig> × , and for p. siphunculus  <dig>  million rnaseq reads resulted in an average coverage of  <dig> × . in all species, the highest expression levels  were found for rrnl, and all genes were found to be transcriptionally active. in s. sthenum, even the large non-coding regions between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , and between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>   appear to be transcribed at high levels , while in m. lignano the non-coding region between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>   is only weakly expressed . in p. siphunculus, a large non-coding region between rrnl and nad <dig>  <cit>  is quite strongly expressed . generally, trnas show the lowest level of mapped rnaseq reads .

non-coding regions and trnas
the largest non-coding region in s. sthenum is located between trna i and atp <dig>  and has a length of 840 bp . this region includes a small  part of the duplicated piece containing nad <dig> and rrns.

we found the full complement of  <dig> trnas in s. sthenum, in addition to  <dig> duplicated  and one triplicated  . in contrast, the mitochondrial genome of m. lignano encodes only  <dig> trnas, as a homologue of trna l <dig> was not detected by either mitos or arwen . secondary structures of all trnas predicted by mitos are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

protein-coding genes
we detected all  <dig> protein-coding genes in the mitochondrial genomes of s. sthenum and m. lignano. this set included atp <dig> both in newly sequenced species and also in the four published polyclads  <cit> . in all but one polyclad, the starting amino acid sequence is mpqm, while in hoploplana elisabelloi it is mphm. in s. sthenum, the atp <dig> amino acid sequence starts with myqm, in m. lignano with the widely conserved mpql . we performed blastp searches with all  <dig> identified flatworm atp <dig> amino acid sequences against ncbi's non-redundant protein sequences database, and recovered e-values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for atp <dig> hits . to provide context for these e-values, we used blastp with the published derived atp <dig> sequences of the gastropod ascobulla fragilis and the gnathostomulid gnathostomula armata, where the lowest e-values compared to other atp <dig> sequences are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. similarly, the atp <dig> sequence of mytilus edulis is only similar to other mytilus species, but not to any other atp <dig> sequences.fig.  <dig> amino acid alignment of atp <dig> in flatworms and other lophotrochozoans: a gastrotrich , annelids , molluscs , a phoronid , a kamptozoan , a bryozoan , a brachiopod  and a nemertean . transmembrane regions are underlaid in light green. putative triclad atp <dig> sequences were omitted because of their derivedness 




using smart  <cit> , we detected transmembrane regions in putative and published atp <dig> sequences . smart also reported the detection of protein family  atp-synt_ <dig> in the putative atp <dig> sequences of the polyclads p. siphunculus and s. maculata, with e-values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for comparison, the published atp <dig> sequences of the gastrotrich lepidodermella squamata and of the nemertean micrura bella scored pfam atp-synt_ <dig> e-values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

the hydrophobicity profiles between the putative flatworm and two published atp <dig> amino acid sequences provide very similar graphs, with positive hydrophobicity scores at the n-terminus and mostly negative scores at the c-terminus .

we found the identified atp <dig> sequences of s. sthenum, m. lignano and p. siphunculus also by blastn searches in their respective transcriptomes, providing additional evidence that these sequences are expressed.

a manual search for atp <dig> in non-coding regions, as well as using blast with the putative atp <dig> sequences of free-living flatworms in published mitochondrial genomes from neodermata species did not detect any homologous genes in this group of flatworms.

gene order
the mitochondrial ribosomal and protein-coding gene orders of the two newly sequenced species and several published species are shown in fig. 1b.

an analysis of gene order rearrangements with crex  <cit>  suggests that at least four steps  are required to change from the putative lophotrochozoan ground pattern  <cit>  to the gene order of the single published representative of gastrotricha, lepidodermella squamata  <cit>  . similarly, it takes four steps from the putative lophotrochozoan ground pattern to m. lignano, and seven steps to the s. sthenum gene arrangement. the fewest steps from the lophotrochozoan ground pattern to any known free-living flatworm mitochondrial genome is two in the tricladida  .

treerex calculates likely ancestral gene orders in nodes of a given phylogenetic tree  <cit> , which we provided  for the taxa where mitochondrial gene order data is available. treerex suggests an ancestral gene order for platyhelminthes , which is identical to the ancestral gene order of rhabditophora . according to the treerex analysis, the gene order of the polyclad prosthiostomum siphunculus used in fig. 1b is the same as the putative ancestral gene order of polycladida as well as of trepaxonemata  . treerex and crex only accept gene matrices with a full complement of genes in all taxa as input, consequently we were not able to include neodermata  in these analyses.

discussion
mitochondrial genome sizes and nucleotide composition
mitogenome sizes of polyclads vary between  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp   <cit> , while those of triclads are generally larger and range between  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp   <cit> . macrostomum lignano, with  <dig>  bp, has the smallest mitochondrial genome of a free-living flatworm studied so far. only neodermatans are smaller, in particular the mitochondrial genomes of the cestodes rarely exceed  <dig>  bp  <cit> . a survey of published mitochondrial genomes shows that the sizes of cestode mitogenomes are within a narrow range between  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp , with only two exceptions larger than  <dig>  bp, . trematode mitogenomes are on average slightly larger, ranging between  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp  in size, with one notable exception of  <dig>  bp . in polyopisthocotyleans and monopisthocotyleans, mitogenome sizes are between  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp .

gene order
the mitochondrial gene order differs between the two basally branching flatworms in this study, lacking any shared pairs of protein-coding or ribosomal gene boundaries other than nad4l-nad <dig>  and a transposed rrnl-nad <dig> gene pair .

while in gastrotrichs the putative lophotrochozoan ancestral gene order is largely recognisable , the extensive gene duplication in stenostomum makes comparisons difficult. in fact, the only remaining adjacent gene pairs between the gastrotrich lepidodermella squamata and s. sthenum are nad4l-nad <dig> and cob-nad <dig>  the gene pair nad4l-nad <dig> is shared throughout the flatworms .

within macrostomorpha, the only full-length mitochondrial genome available is that of m. lignano . the partial mitochondrial genome of microstomum lineare is notably different from m. lignano, however , hinting at non-conserved mitochondrial gene orders within macrostomorpha, similar to the situation found in polycladida, where stylochoplana maculata has a completely different gene order from that of other polyclad representatives  <cit> .

between m. lignano and two of the four published polyclads , the only identical adjacent gene pairs are nad3-cox <dig>  nad4l-nad <dig>  and nad1-atp <dig>  not surprisingly, the gene order in m. lignano requires the lowest number of rearrangements from the inferred ancestral gene order in flatworms, while the gene order of p. siphunculus may closely reflect the ancestral gene order of trepaxonematans .

we have noticed some confusion about gene content and order in the partial mitochondrial genome of microstomum lineare, originally published by ruiz-trillo et al.  <cit> . in the study of golombek et al.  <cit> , an additional gene, nad <dig>  was shown in their figure  <dig>  our own analysis suggests this may be an artifact of an inaccurate mitos annotation, which weakly supports nad <dig> in the genome fragment, but further blast searches show this to be a very unlikely nad <dig> candidate. in the study of aguado et al.  <cit> , the gene order of m. lineare is shown inverted in their fig.  <dig>  in our own figure , we depict the original gene order and content  <cit> .

the gene block nad <dig>  nad <dig> and cox <dig> was suggested to be a possible plesiomorphy for the rhabditophora  <cit> , but it is not found in both studied macrostomorphans or the catenulid s. sthenum  and is thus more likely an apomorphy for trepaxonemata, which is supported by the treerex analysis . another possible trepaxonematan apomorphy is the block cob, nad4l and nad <dig> , also corroborated by treerex . the gene pair cox <dig> and nad <dig> is ancestral in bilaterians, in lophotrochozoans and also in gastrotrichs   <cit>  the likely sister group of platyhelminthes  <cit> . within flatworms, a close association between cox <dig> and nad <dig> - either as cox3-nad <dig> or nad3-cox <dig> is conserved within most polyclads and also in macrostomum, and is thus likely a plesiomorphy in these groups . in all other flatworms, including s. sthenum and m. lineare, cox <dig> and nad <dig> are not adjacent, suggesting an independently derived character state.

ribosomal gene adjacency  is very common in bilaterians and lophotrochozoans  <cit>  and appears to be conserved in m. lineare, in triclads and neodermatans . as noted by aguado et al.  <cit> , the two ribosomal genes are not adjacent in polyclads, and this is also true for s. sthenum and m. lignano . a parsimonious explanation for these findings is multiple, independent loss of ribosomal gene adjacency. this solution is supported by the relative vicinity of rrns and rrnl in s. sthenum, only interrupted by nad <dig> . alternatively, the adjacency of ribosomal genes was lost for all flatworms and was regained in m. lineare and in trepaxonemata.

the location of trna v between rrns and rrnl is an ancestral and widespread condition  <cit>  and commonly found also in lophotrochozoans, including the gastrotrich lepidodermella squamata  <cit> . this feature was lost in the common ancestor of the platyhelminthes, as it is not found in any of the  <dig> flatworms sequenced so far, including those flatworm groups where rrns and rrnl are still adjacent. in s. sthenum, both rrns and trna v are duplicated and adjacent to each other , which is likely a plesiomorphy. in m. lignano trna v is located downstream of rrnl , probably the result of a transposition. in the other sequenced macrostomorphan, m. lineare, both ribosomal genes are present in the published mitochondrial genome fragment, but trna v was not identified between the ribosomal genes  <cit> .

our crex and treerex analyses  suggest that the gene order of s. sthenum is highly derived; possibly representatives of other catenulida families could shed light on the ancestral mitochondrial gene order of catenulida. similarly, the ancestral gene order of macrostomorpha cannot be deduced from the available data, thus more representatives of early branching flatworms should be analysed.

atp <dig> is in the ground pattern of flatworms

atp <dig> has been noted as missing from the mitochondrial genomes of flatworms  <cit> , but it was annotated in the single sequenced gastrotrich, lepidodermella squamata  <cit> . annotation of atp <dig> is particularly difficult, as its amino acid sequence - apart from the first four amino acids mpql - is not well conserved, and it has been reported as lacking in nematodes, chaetognaths, rotiferans and bivalve molluscs  <cit> . recently it was suggested that an extremely derived atp <dig> may be present in triclad flatworms   <cit> . the authors based their argument on the fact that their putative atp <dig> was expressed in rnaseq reads and that the sequence codes for a protein with putative transmembrane domains, like atp <dig>  however, no pronounced similarity with atp <dig> sequences from other animals was found , and the putative atp <dig> sequences were annotated with a single question mark instead of a specific gene name  <cit> .

as automated gene annotation with mitos  <cit>  could not identify atp <dig> neither in our two basally branching flatworms nor in three of the four published polyclad mitochondrial genomes , we have manually searched for atp <dig> candidates in all six mitochondrial genomes. in this way, we were able to identify atp <dig> in stenostomum, macrostomum and in all four published polyclads . the presence of atp <dig> in these mitochondrial genomes is supported by rnaseq read mapping , transmembrane regions at the n-terminus , hydrophobicity profiles  and, weakly, by blast and pfam e-values. this implies that atp <dig> has not been lost in all flatworms, but only in the parasitic neodermata, and it also supports the notion that the extremely derived atp <dig> candidate found in triclads may be a functional atp <dig>  <cit> . this case also highlights the importance of manual curation following automated annotation, and that observation bias  can lead to oversight.

multiple gene duplications and transcription from the minus strand in stenostomum
with s. sthenum, we present the first mitochondrial genome of a flatworm with both extensive duplication  and transcription from the minus strand of a substantial number of genes . so far, only trna genes have been reported as being duplicated in mitochondrial genomes of some flatworms, namely trna n in the triclads dugesia japonica and d. ryukyuensis  <cit>  and trna c in the two parasitic flatworms schistosoma mansoni and s. japonicum  <cit> . the highly unusual features of s. sthenum most likely represent a derived condition, as neither gastrotrichs, nor the inferred lophotrochozoan ground pattern show any similarity to stenostomum in this regard .

large non-coding rna
rnaseq reads were mapped onto the mitochondrial genome of several triclad flatworms  <cit> , providing evidence for large  regions that were transcriptionally active, but not coding. here we have mapped rnaseq reads to large non-coding regions of s. sthenum, m. lignano and p. siphunculus , supporting the idea that large non-coding rna is not restricted to vertebrates  <cit> .

tandem repeats in both m. lignano and p. siphunculus occur in their large non-coding regions and such sequences have been hypothesised to represent control regions and/or potential origins of replication  <cit> . tandem repeats in non-coding regions are also very common in parasitic flatworms  <cit> . interestingly, in s. sthenum there are no tandem repeats, suggesting that the putative control region is not uniformly structured in flatworms, and that tandem repeats were either lost in catenulids or are an apomorphy for rhabditophora.

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced two mitochondrial genomes from the earliest branching flatworm taxa, catenulida  and macrostomorpha . s. sthenum shows a highly unusual duplication pattern including a ribosomal, a protein-coding and several trna genes, and has several genes transcribed from the minus strand. m. lignano has a markedly different gene order from that known from the partial mitochondrial genome of another macrostomorphan, microstomum lineare. even with our newly sequenced species, mitochondrial genome data are still lacking from half of flatworm orders . with the currently available information on flatworm mitochondrial genomes, only a preliminary ancestral mitochondrial gene order for flatworms can be inferred. more representatives of early divergent, non-parasitic taxa such as catenulida and macrostomorpha, but also from the  <dig> as yet unsequenced flatworm orders are required to obtain a comprehensive picture of mitochondrial genome evolution in flatworms. another major conclusion of the present study is that atp <dig> is present in several and possibly all free-living flatworms, and that atp <dig> has been lost only in the parasitic neodermata.

manual curation of automatically annotated mitochondrial genomes is still very important. without meticulous analysis of new and published mitochondrial genomes of free-living flatworms, and the combined use of rna and dna data, atp <dig> may not have been found and annotated in flatworm mitochondrial genomes.

a very recent paper on the mitochondrial genome of the closely related catenulid stenostomum leucops  <cit>  has annotated a divergent atp <dig> gene, which supports the findings reported here for s. sthenum.
