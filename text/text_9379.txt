BACKGROUND
cassava  is widely cultivated for its starchy storage roots and is a staple food and animal feed in tropical and sub-tropical areas  <cit> . it is also considered to be an important source of modified starches and bioethanol in china and other southeast asian countries  <cit> . nevertheless, as a tropical root crop, cassava is native to a warm habitat and is categorized as a cold-sensitive species  <cit> . thus, low temperatures and frozen conditions are the most important limiting factors for its geographical location and productivity. in the subtropics, where unpredictable cold weather occurs occasionally, it is important to protect the storage roots and propagation stems from chilling stress. for example, the unprecedented freezing disaster occurred in southern china in january  <dig> caused great damage to cassava stem seeds and led to yield reduction in guangxi, guangdong and other provinces, resulting in a loss of a billion chinese yuan  <cit> . furthermore, to ensure a prolonged growth period  in the high latitude regions, novel cassava cultivars with improved cold tolerance are in demand.

under low temperature below 10°c, many species of tropical or subtropical origin are typically injured or killed and show various symptoms of chilling injury due to the inability to adapt to non-freezing low temperatures  <cit> . for example, cassava exhibits obvious symptoms of damage at these temperatures, including delayed sprouting of the stem cutting, yield decrease, reduced leaf expansion, chlorosis and even necrosis in its leaves  <cit> . low temperatures have also been recognized as an important facilitator of decreases in nutrient absorption rates , reductions in the leaf photosynthetic rate, and the inhibition of plant growth  <cit> . in addition, the physiological status of cold-stressed plants is also altered, such as transient increases in hormone levels   <cit>  and changes in membrane lipid composition  <cit> . furthermore, the accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as soluble sugars, betaine, and proline  <cit> , and increases in the level of antioxidants  <cit>  are also occurred. in contrast, temperate plants can withstand freezing temperatures following a period of low, but non-freezing, temperatures, a process called cold acclimation  <cit> . the mechanisms of cold acclimation have been extensively investigated in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , as well as in other important crop species such as maize and barley  <cit> . the most extensively studied mechanism involves a class of ethylene response factors  known as the dehydration-responsive element-binding proteins/c-repeat-binding factors . they interact with the dehydration-responsive element/c-repeat element  in the promoters of their downstream target genes to execute a highly coordinated transcriptional response to low temperature signals. overall, less information is available for tropical plants . therefore, it would be important to increase our understanding of the physiological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics that are associated with cold stress in tropical cassava, especially during the early stages. moreover, the function of homologous genes in arabidopsis could be used to predict the function of cassava genes which may share the same biological functions or common regulatory scenarios among different plant species  <cit> .

with the development of molecular technologies and 'omics' tools, microarray studies have become a useful strategy for the global analysis of plant gene expression. using cdna microarrays or whole genome arrays, the abiotic stress responses of arabidopsis and other plants have been widely analyzed. for examples, the expression patterns of genes were identified in arabidopsis and rice under conditions of drought, cold, high-salinity or abscisic acid treatment  <cit> . the transcriptomic identification of candidate genes involved in sunflower responses to chilling and salt stresses has also been reported  <cit> . the long-oligonucleotide microarray, which has many advantages compared to other microarray technologies, reliably detects transcript ratios even at one copy per cell in complicated biological samples, and could distinguish different members of gene families  <cit> . thus, it is appropriate to explore the early cold stress responsive genes of cassava using a 60-mer long-oligonucleotide microarray approach.

thus far, several studies have been reported in cassava using genomic tools for developing new knowledge and technologies. for instance, est and cdna libraries have been constructed in cassava for the identification of starch biosynthesis and biotic/abiotic-responsive genes or genes corresponding to the different developmental stages of various tissues  <cit> . studies using cassava cdna microarrays to analyze gene expression in cassava plants subjected to post-harvest physiological deterioration  or xanthomonas axonopodis infection have also been reported  <cit> . moreover, gene expression profiling related to the different growth stages of cassava storage roots was recently conducted using a long-oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> . fortunately, a draft genome sequence for cassava has been released and recently updated , which greatly facilitates cassava research worldwide. nevertheless, comprehensive genome-wide expression profiling data for cassava under cold stress treatment are still lacking, which limits our capacity to decipher the molecular mechanisms related to various stress responses. additionally, to stabilize cassava yield even under unfavorable growth conditions, it is necessary to study the changes of pan-genome genes or pathways in order to identify key candidates for improving cold tolerance in cassava.

in this study, a gene expression profiling of apical shoots from cassava subjected to low temperature was conducted using a custom-designed, 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray covering  <dig>  cassava transcripts. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes  were identified, and their biological functions were characterized through gene ontology  annotation and kegg pathway analysis. our study could increase the understanding of cassava gene regulation under the condition of cold stress and reveal novel approaches to improve cold tolerance through genetic engineering.

RESULTS
phenotypic and physiological changes of cassava in response to cold
cassava is a typical tropical crop adapted to warm climates. under normal conditions, 3-month-old cassava  plants have vigorous apical buds and fully expanded mature leaves with upward leaf fingers . when a low-temperature treatment is applied to cassava at 7°c under weak light for  <dig> h, the plants displayed visible morphological changes, including weak dehydration and wilting of the apical buds and leaves, especially in the buds, as well as downward leaf fingers . under prolonged exposure to the stress , the whole plants exhibited obvious phenotypic damages, including softening and downward bending of the petioles, loss of strength in the immature stems and more severe wilting leaves . generally, the treated plants could be partially recovered and resumed growth when transferred into normal conditions , indicating that the cellular changes caused by a  <dig> h cold treatment were reversible. since apical shoots show extremely sensitive response to low temperature , the apical shoots  of 3-month-old plants, which were treated for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, were used as material for microarray hybridization.

in addition to morphological changes, a clear impact on ultra-structure of chloroplasts was also observed in leaves of cold-stressed cassava plants. compared to normal chloroplasts in unstressed leaves , the stacking numbers of thylakoids were dramatically reduced and less organized, and the starch granules had almost disappeared . the ultra-structural changes in cellular organelles indicate that cold stress might exert an adverse impact on plant growth, causing a reduced photosynthetic rate under the stress.

cold stress also leads to obviously physiological changes in cassava. two stress responsive metabolites, namely malondialdehyde  and proline, were monitored. mda is considered to be the final product of lipid peroxidation in the plant cell membrane and is an important indicator of membrane system injuries and cellular metabolism deterioration  <cit> . it has also been reported that mda contents change during cold stress treatment in plants  <cit> . in our experiment, compared to the control level, the mda concentrations decreased rapidly to 50% after  <dig> h but increased almost 25% after  <dig> h; the observed levels had experienced a nearly two-fold change after  <dig> h of stress treatment . decrease in mda content at  <dig> h might be due to a transient stress response of cassava to the low temperature shock. but, the prolonged treatment  finally led to cell damages and mda accumulation. the accumulation of proline is frequently associated with whole plant tolerance to chilling and other stresses  <cit> . unlike that of mda, the concentration of proline increased rapidly and achieved nearly a three-fold change after  <dig> h; it then decreased slightly but remained at a high level until  <dig> h . these results were consistent with previous studies that proline accumulated in leaves exposure to cold, salt, and other stresses in arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . the accumulation of these metabolites is a good indication that the stress-treated plants were actively mounting a stress response during the periods when they were subjected to cold stress.

microarray for transcriptomic analysis of low-temperature treated cassava
to explore the transcriptomic changes of cassava in response to cold stress, a custom long-oligonucleotide  microarray generated by the agilent sureprint ink-jet technology was applied in the current study. the detailed protocol for designing the cassava microarray has been described by yang et al  <cit>  to validate the microarray quality, the signal-to-noise ratio  for each spot was calculated as described by leiske et al  <cit>  the average percentages of acceptable spots  and high-quality spots  were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in all  <dig> arrays, which demonstrated the overall reproducibility and high quality of the array. the hierarchical clustering results indicated the clear separation of the samples from different time points , suggesting that the entire experiment from sample collection to data extraction was reproducible and reliable. five house-keeping genes  were used as the internal controls and their expressions were consistent in the samples at different time points , confirming the reliability and accuracy of these microarrays.

transcriptomic responses to cold treatment
before normalization, the signal intensities of each feature were filtered against negative controls on the array, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of probes on the array were expressed at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively. two filtering criteria were used to define differentially expressed genes  in our data analysis: a two-fold change in transcript levels among every two time points and a p value ≤  <dig> . to analyze the similarities and differences among the cold-responsive transcriptomes, a hierarchical clustering was prepared to represent the transcripts of all the differentially expressed probes at the  <dig> replicates of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. these results indicated significant differences in the gene expression profiles between the treatments of  <dig> h and  <dig> h or  <dig> h and  <dig> h, in contrast to the relatively high similarity of the expression profiles between  <dig> h and  <dig> h . among the degs,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were down-regulated by analyzing  <dig> h/ <dig> h,  <dig> h/ <dig> h, and  <dig> h/ <dig> h, respectively . notably, compared to only  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed differentially expressed at  <dig> h/ <dig> h and  <dig> h/ <dig> h,  <dig> degs were found at  <dig> h/ <dig> h, suggesting a prolonged stress treatment  could trigger more stress-related gene expression. moreover, about 80% of  <dig> h/ <dig> h and 75% of  <dig> h/ <dig> h degs overlapped with those of  <dig> h/ <dig> h, which indicated a strong linkage among the  <dig> stressed comparison points and a progressive biological process.

in total,  <dig> degs, including  <dig> cold-inducible and  <dig> cold-repressed genes, were identified on our array; only one gene  was up-regulated at  <dig> h/ <dig> h but down-regulated at  <dig> h/ <dig> h . these represent about  <dig> % of the total expressed cassava transcripts on the array. this result indicated that even for tropical crops , which have adapted to warm climates, possess a large amount of cold-responsive genes as other temperate plants . therefore, the differences in the ability of tropical species and temperate species to tolerate cold might not totally be due to the amount of genes responsive to cold stress. instead, we speculate that plants require to timely and coordinately mobilize the biological functions and regulatory networks of stress-responsive genes against stress. consistent with our observations, a recent study confirmed such scenario even between two close plant species  <cit> .

gene ontology clustering of cold-regulated genes
to explore the biological functions of cold-responsive genes, a total of  <dig>  sequences were used as a query to perform an alignment with arabidopsis proteins. of these,  <dig>  sequences had hits with  <dig>  arabidopsis proteins, and  <dig>   sequences had hits with  <dig>  arabidopsis proteins at an e value ≤ 1e- <dig>  after searching the descriptions of the  <dig> degs,  <dig> queries had the highest homologies with annotated proteins according to the arabidopsis information resource , which accounted for  <dig> % of the responsive genes . to determine the detailed function of the  <dig> hits with arabidopsis gene locus identifiers, a go annotation was performed with the go terms of tair , in which  <dig> go ids were hit by  <dig> gene locus identifiers . therefore, functional clusters that were classified according to the three components  are presented and discussed . based on the tair percent analysis, the categories of 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress', 'transcription factor activity', and 'chloroplast' were the major cold-related go slims that strongly attracted our attention.

cold-responsive genes related to 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress'
in the go terms of 'biological process', the categories of 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress', both accounted for  <dig> % of the total gos, were suggested to be the most relevant to cold stress . the largest proportions of 'biological process' terms were annotated as 'other cellular processes' , 'other metabolic processes' , 'unknown biological process' , and 'other biological processes' , indicating comprehensive changes in cassava gene expression . in addition, 'protein metabolism' was another noticeable major category  supposed to be also involved in the cold stress response  <cit> .

there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes assigned to the go terms of 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress', respectively . because  <dig> genes were common in both categories, we combined the two categories for analysis and discussion . among the overlapping genes,  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes were included. their encoding proteins cover a wide range of biological functions, including transcription factor , protein kinases , small heat shock proteins , ros scavenging enzymes , fatty acid desaturases , signaling molecular proteins , programmed cell death -related gene , and genes involved in the gibberellin acid  and jasmonic acid  metabolism pathway . among the genes specifically related to the 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus', protein degradation genes  and early flowering  <dig> were up-regulated. meanwhile, genes involved in aba signal transduction  and disease resistance protein , which were down-regulated by cold, were uniquely identified in go slim as 'response to stress' . most of these cold-responsive genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated at  <dig> h/ <dig> h, except  <dig> genes encoding the calcium ion binding protein , ethylene response transcription activator  <dig> , map kinase kinase  <dig>  and pseudo-response regulator  <dig>  it is notable that  <dig> out of these  <dig> stress-associated genes were up-regulated, indicating that the up-regulation of cold-responsive transcripts by low temperature may play a crucial role in the stress tolerance of plants  <cit> .

notes: low temperature responsive genes are grouped to 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress' based on the go annotation. positive and negative values of log <dig> ratio are either up- or down-regulated genes in the three pair-comparisons. no significant fold changes are indicated by "-".

of their homologous genes in arabidopsis, the map kinase  <dig>  beta-ketoacyl-coa synthase, cat <dig>  and tch <dig> were previously reported to be involved in the cold stress response process. for example, map kinase  <dig>  which is required for cytokinesis, was implicated in cold and salt stress tolerance  <cit> ; beta-ketoacyl-coa synthase, which is involved in the biosynthesis of vlcfa , was also responsive to cold and other osmotic stresses  <cit> . cat <dig>  a target of plastid, could increase its transcript abundance in response to cold stress  <cit> . tch <dig> has been implicated in calcium signaling in response to diverse stimuli, such as cold, light, pathogens, and touch  <cit> . gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase, which degrades active gas, is involved in cold response  <cit>  and up-regulation of its transcript implied that ga level may be reduced under cold stress. additionally, calcineurin b-like -interacting protein kinase, which has protein serine/threonine kinase activity, has been reported to be involved in the defense response to fungus  <cit> . these results revealed that there are considerable conserved and common components in cold stress response mechanisms across plant species, including temperate and tropical plants.

besides, a large number of genes with known function were firstly identified in the cold response. the ap <dig> domain transcription factor , a member of the erf  subfamily b- <dig> of erf/ap <dig> transcription factor family, has been reported involved in response to fungus and chitin in arabidopsis. in this study, the transcript abundance of the ap <dig> domain transcription factor was up-regulated 16-fold by cold, indicating that it may play a significant role in the regulation of novel signaling pathways to enhance cassava cold tolerance. the expression of a stearoyl-acp desaturase gene ssi <dig>  which involves in fatty acid desaturation, was up-regulated almost 10-fold under cold stress. this change suggested that the gene might be participated in altering membrane lipid composition to enhance membrane fluidity. maternal effect embryo arrest  <dig> , which required for embryonic development ending in seed dormancy, was also highly induced in this study. interestingly, three transcripts  that respond to red or far-red light in arabidopsis were cold-inducible, indicating a crosstalk between light signaling and cold stress response.

in addition, a large number of genes with unknown function were also firstly recorded as cold responsive genes. for instance, four members of mlp-like protein  were all up-regulated by  <dig> h cold treatment. alpha-crystallin domain  <dig> , bet v i allergen family protein, and homology of yeast autophagy  <dig> were highly induced more than 5-fold by cold. two members of ring-h <dig> finger a2a zinc ion binding proteins were also found to be down-regulated. taken together, cassava might evolve not only conserved but also specific molecular mechanisms related to stress signaling and response.

transcription factors response to cold stress
for the 'molecular function' go terms, 'transferase activity', 'hydrolase activity', and 'transcription factor activity' were the three major categories. they accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total gos, respectively . among them, genes associated with 'transcription factor activity' may be central regulators involved in early cold signal transduction that trigger a cascade of downstream gene expression.

transcription factors  play a significant role in plant development and stress tolerance  <cit> . to identify the transcription factors involved in the cold stress response, we surveyed the biological functions of putative tfs that were differentially expressed in cassava under the cold treatment. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as tfs when the  <dig> identifiers were annotated in tair. the number of up-regulated tfs  was nearly equal to the number of down-regulated ones , suggesting that both transcriptional activation and repression are involved. the arabidopsis genome has more than  <dig>  predicted tfs belonging to  <dig> gene families in the plant transcription factor database   <cit> . according to this classification,  <dig> cold-responsive transcription factors fell into  <dig> families, except  <dig>  with non-classification , and they were annotated with the detailed go slims . in arabidopsis, at least five tf families have been reported to be involved in the cold stress response process, including ap2-erebp , myb , nac , bhlh , and wrky   <cit> .

notes: positive and negative values of log <dig> ratio are either up- or down-regulated genes in the three pair-comparisons. no significant fold changes are indicated as "-".

in our study, ap2-erebp, myb, and gras were the three major tf families, containing six, five, and five genes of the  <dig> cold-responsive tfs, respectively. the ap2-erebp family plays a major role in the early stages of the cold response, as evidenced by many well-characterized drebs/cbfs cold regulatory pathway. cbf proteins, belonging to a- <dig> subfamily of erf/ap <dig> tf family, are major regulators that function in activating cold-regulated effectors in arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . in our study, all members of ap2-erebp family are grouped to different subfamilies of erf/ap <dig> tf family. for instance, rap <dig> , erf <dig>  ap <dig> domain transcription factor , and rap <dig>  encode members of b- <dig>  b- <dig>  a- <dig>  and a- <dig> subfamilies of erf/ap <dig> tf family, respectively. some members have been reported to show response to cold stress in arabidopsis, such as rap <dig>  and rap <dig>   <cit> . however, others were firstly identified to be involved in cold response, such as ap <dig> domain tf  and erf <dig>  importantly, most members of this family were highly induced at  <dig> h during cold treatment, which was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr , suggesting a relatively delay in triggering transcriptional cascades in the cold response of cassava. only the erf <dig> transcription repressor was down-regulated after  <dig> h under cold stress. an earlier study had reported that its homologous gene  of erf <dig> also experienced a significant decrease in its expression after exposure to heat and freezing in arabidopsis  <cit> . one of cbf homologous gene  was found to be up-regulated following  <dig> h cold treatment. due to a high p value , it was excluded from the analysis under our standard . such scenario indicates that the timely response of dreb/cbf pathway to cold might be variable among different species. indeed, its cold-induced expression at  <dig> h following cold treatment, together with most of the ap2-erebp family factors, was verified by real-time rt-pcr . therefore, based on our analysis, we speculated that cassava might mount a relatively slow mobilization of stress-related regulators and their downstream genes after exposure to cold, rendering cassava vulnerable to cold stress. additionally, the transcript of an inducer of cbf expression  <dig> -like gene of cassava was found to be unchanged . in arabidopsis and other plants, ices have been reported to be constitutively expressed  <cit> .

a comprehensive expression analysis of myb tfs demonstrated that almost all myb tfs are responsive to stresses or hormones  <cit> . in our study, five myb or myb-related family members showed differential expression, with  <dig> cold-inducible and  <dig> cold-repressed. two transcripts, encoding pcl <dig> with a single myb dna-binding domain, were required for circadian rhythms  <cit> , and the other three myb/myb-related transcription factors were responsive to a diverse of hormone treatments in arabidopsis  <cit> . differential expression of myb tfs implies that other environmental or hormonal pathways may be involved in cold response in cassava. furthermore, the up-regulation of the cust_ <dig> transcript  was also validated by real-time rt-pcr. members of the gras gene family encode transcriptional regulators that have diverse functions in plant growth and development, such as gibberellin signal transduction, root radial patterning, and axillary meristem formation  <cit> . although the arabidopsis genome encodes at least  <dig> gras protein family members, few gras proteins have been characterized thus far  <cit> . it is worth noting that all gras family members were down-regulated on the array , suggesting that cold stress inhibit plant growth and conserve energy to adapt to the adverse environment  <cit> . similarly, hsf tfs were reported to be involved in the response to heat and other abiotic stresses  <cit> . the microarray analysis also showed the inducible expression of heat shock transcription factor a <dig> and c <dig> following cold treatment . interestingly, a <dig> was also found to be induced in response to low temperatures in potato and arabidopsis  <cit> . the induction of heat shock tfs and heat shock proteins  revealed that cold and heat stresses may share common responsive elements. the majority of wrky family tfs is known to be responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stress, despite the fact that most research has focused on the role of these genes in plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> . wrky <dig>  known to encode a novel cam-binding transcription factor of the wrky group iid in arabidopsis  <cit> , was also found to have differential expression in our study. this might indicate a crosstalk between cold stress response and plant-pathogen interaction in cassava.

in addition to the above-mentioned tfs, we found two arebs that were cold-repressed in our study. these factors belonged to group a bzip transcription factors, which play a role in plant pathogen responses, light signaling, and aba and abiotic stress signaling, and were induced by salt and aba in arabidopsis  <cit> . the zinc finger family has been demonstrated to be involved in the cold response in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our study, we found  <dig> probes that fell into  <dig> subfamilies of the zinc finger family , including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes. zinc finger proteins involve in ros and abiotic stress signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . the c2h2-type zinc finger protein gene zat12-like was induced not only by cold stress, but also by peg and salt stress, as illustrated by our real-time rt-pcr results . this indicates that cassava needs to trigger the expression of ros-scavenging genes to adapt oxidative stress. the plant-specific nac transcription factor family has been implicated in plant development processes, such as shoot apical meristem  maintenance and organ differentiation  <cit> , as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . we found only one transcript encoding for the nac domain transcription factor, which was down-regulated on the array. in addition, five novel transcription factor families  were also identified. their homologous genes in other plant species have not yet been reported in response to cold stress, suggesting that these genes might be specific to cassava and are attractive targets for further functional characterization.

cold-responsive genes related to 'chloroplast'
the category of 'chloroplast' was an abundant and important go slim. it accounted for  <dig> % of total gos in 'cellular component' , indicating that a great number of chloroplast-associated genes changed their expression to adapt to cold. this result suggests that the chloroplast might be one of the major organelles affected, as supported by the observation of damaged chloroplasts in cold-stressed leaves . although the differential expression of chloroplast-related genes might also be affected by other environmental changes on cassava plants during the treatment, i.e. light change, low temperature was the dominant factor in this study.

chloroplast is an important organelle unique to plant cells and is the site of photosynthesis. in previous reports, cold stress could reduce the rate of photosynthesis by interfering with the function of many photosynthesis-related proteins  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> out of  <dig> cold-responsive transcripts were assigned to the 'chloroplast' class, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . among them, several genes encoding protein localized to thylakoid were identified. for examples, cab <dig> , a lipid-associated family protein, a thylakoid leumenal  <dig> kda protein, and a hypothetical protein  were all up-regulated under cold stress. in contrast, lhca <dig> , psal , and the rubredoxin family protein were dramatically down-regulated. two of them  have also been proposed to be involved in photosynthesis in arabidopsis. these results suggested that differential expression of chloroplast genes, especially those encoding for thylakoid associated proteins, by cold stress might lead to the processes of thylakoid distortion, chloroplast malfunction, and photosynthesis inhibition.

notes: positive and negative values of log <dig> ratio are either up- or down-regulated genes in the three pair-comparisons. no significant fold changes are indicated as "-".

kegg pathway analysis of cold-responsive genes
to determine whether the cold stress responsive genes engaged in specific pathways,  <dig> arabidopsis agi loci representing the  <dig> degs were used as objects to search against kegg pathway maps in arabidopsis thaliana. finally,  <dig> related pathways were identified . several interesting and important pathways, including 'plant hormone signal transduction' , 'plant-pathogen interaction' , 'phenylalanine metabolism' , 'fatty acid biosynthesis' , and 'starch and sucrose metabolism' , were involved and function in the early response to cold stress.

'plant hormone signal transduction'  comprised  <dig> genes of the  <dig> cold-regulated and pathway-hit genes on our array. in this pathway, the transcripts of gai, saur , ebf <dig> , ein <dig> , and areb <dig> were determined to be down-regulated, and the transcript of erf <dig> was identified as being up-regulated. their homologous genes have been reported to be implicated in ga, auxin, ethylene , and aba-mediate hormone signal transduction, respectively  <cit> . in plants, these hormones play crucial roles in a diverse set of developmental processes, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, aba accumulates in response to abiotic stresses, such as cold, salt, and drought  <cit> . among these hormone-related genes in arabidopsis, gai has been also reported to decrease its transcript levels in response to cold  <cit> , and erf <dig> has been identified in the response to chitin, a plant-defense elicitor  <cit> . previous studies have suggested that the differential regulation of genes involved in hormone signal transduction might play key roles in the early cold stress response  <cit> .

two other important pathways, including 'phenylalanine metabolism'  and 'plant-pathogen interaction' , were also found in our study to be regulated. pds <dig> , asp <dig> , and peroxidase  <dig>  associated with 'phenylalanine metabolism', were all highly accumulated in response to cold. as noted in previous studies, pds <dig> has been reported to be engaged in the carotenoid and plastoquinone biosynthetic process  <cit> . asp <dig>  also participating in proline metabolism, has been shown to be associated with leaf senescence and to be induced in response to darkness and ethylene-induced artificial senescence  <cit> . in arabidopsis and other plants, proline levels are mainly determined by balance of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, controlled by p5cs  and prodh  genes, respectively  <cit> . up-regulation of cassava homologous genes p5cs and asp <dig>  and down-regulation of prodh, which were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr , might correlate with the high accumulation of proline . peroxidase  <dig>  a member of the class iii peroxidases, is involved in the response to oxidation stress and potassium resupply  <cit> . additionally, transcripts from map kinase  <dig>  une <dig> , and tch <dig>  members of the 'plant-pathogen interaction' pathway, were also induced by cold . map kinase  <dig> and tch <dig> have been shown to be involved in response to several stresses, including cold, salinity, and heat in arabidopsis  <cit> ; whereas une <dig> also encodes a calcium ion binding protein. these results indicate that calcium ion binding proteins and kinase-mediated signal transduction may play pivotal roles in cold stress response in cassava.

notes: all data are shown log <dig> ratio, and positive and negative values of log <dig> ratio are either up- or down-regulated genes in the three pair-comparisons. no significant fold changes are indicated as "-". values of real-time rt-pcr analysis showing in bold font indicate inconsistent data compared with microarray analysis. ap: 'arginine and proline metablism', ch: 'chloroplast', cr: 'circadian rhythm-plant', pm: 'protein metabolism', pp: 'plant-pathogen interaction', rs: 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress', tf: 'transcription factor activity', uk: unknown.

in addition, 'fatty acid biosynthesis'  and 'starch and sucrose metabolism'  were also identified through the pathway analysis. fab <dig>  and ssi <dig>  which were also assigned to 'chloroplast' category, were involved in 'fatty acid biosynthesis'. earlier studies in arabidopsis indicated that fab <dig> is correlated with chilling stress  <cit> , whereas ssi <dig> has been shown to respond to biotic attacks, including viruses, insects, and bacteria  <cit> . both were strongly induced during the entire cold treatment process, indicating that membrane modification may occur during the early cold stress response. in arabidopsis, tps <dig>  has been reported to participate in the trehalose biosynthetic process. amy <dig>  has also been shown to take part in the degradation of starch to sugar and to be induced by biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . in our study, tps <dig> and amy <dig> were identified as being involved in 'starch and sucrose metabolism'. their cold-induced expression was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr analysis . in cold-stressed leaves, starch granules were found to have disappeared . even though their total sugar content remained unchanged after  <dig> h and was lower after  <dig> h of treatment, an obvious increase was detected after  <dig> h . interestingly, sucrose was significantly accumulated and reached the highest level in  <dig> h; whereas glucose levels were only slightly increased under cold stress . these results suggested that soluble sugars might act as both osmolytes and signal molecules in the cold response of cassava, similar to other plant species  <cit> . it also provided insight into the hypothesis that starch degradation provides conserve energy for plants under adverse conditions. such transition from synthesis metabolism to degradation metabolism would also explain the reduced productivity observed in plants under stress conditions.

in short, a variety of interesting and important pathways are involved and function in the cellular response to cold stress. despite many pathways, e.g., 'plant hormone signal transduction' , 'fatty acid biosynthesis' , and 'starch and sucrose metabolism' , have been well-demonstrated in other plant species, regulation of different pathways or gene has been observed, illustrating that a complex and specific network is involved in the early cold response in cassava.

validation of microarray results by real-time rt-pcr
to validate our microarray data, real-time rt-pcr analysis was performed on  <dig> selected differentially expressed transcripts, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes . these genes belong to divergent functional categories or pathways. for instance, four genes  were involved in 'response to abiotic and biotic stimulus' and 'response to stress'. one gene  was implicated in 'protein metabolism,' and other three genes  were grouped as transcription factors. in addition,  <dig> genes  were assigned to 'circadian rhythm-plant' , 'plant-pathogen interaction', and 'arginine and proline metabolism' , respectively. seven genes that are unclassified in the go slims or pathways but displayed significant changes in transcript abundance were also tested. for these genes, the fold change  measured by real-time rt-pcr and by microarray was highly consistent . their expression kinetics from the real-time rt-pcr results was similar to those of the microarray analysis. these results re-confirmed the accuracy of our microarray data.

genes responsive to different stresses and their tissue-specific expressions
the cold stress-signaling pathway may interact with other signaling systems of, for example, aba, salt, and drought  <cit> . the expression patterns of the  <dig> cold-responsive genes were analyzed by real-time rt-pcr using cassava in vitro shoot cultures treated with  <dig> μm aba, 25% peg, and  <dig> mm nacl for  <dig> h. genes with fold changes larger than  <dig> were defined as strongly responsive to the stresses. several cold-responsive genes were also strongly induced by aba, peg, or salt stress  . these results indicated that dynamic crosstalk exists among signaling pathways related to cold, drought, and salt in cassava because all of these stresses cause cellular dehydration  <cit> . genes uniquely responsive to cold stress drew more attention in our study, such as tch <dig> , ap <dig> domain transcription factor , and jaz <dig>  . both tch <dig> and jaz <dig> were involved in the 'plant-pathogen interaction' in arabidopsis  and rice, suggesting that chilling-induced processes share some common features with the defense mechanism against pathogens in plants  <cit> . in addition, protein transmembrane transporter , which was strongly induced by aba and salt stress, was also believed to function in early signal reception.

notes: thirteen selected cold responsive genes were analyzed under different treatments, including  <dig> μm aba, 25% peg,  <dig> mm nacl, and cold stress  for  <dig> h. values that were dramatically higher  than those of control are shown in bold font.

to further analyze the expression patterns of these stress-regulated genes in different tissues, real-time rt-pcr analysis was conducted. mrnas were extracted from the apical buds , fibrous roots , mature leaves , stem cambia , young leaves , and young stems  of 3-month-old cassava plants grown in a greenhouse. interestingly,  <dig> tested genes were primarily expressed in fr, ml, sc, and ys rather than in ap and yl . this tissue-specific expression of cold-responsive genes might explain why the apical shoots, including ap and yl, were more susceptible to cold stress than ml, but this difference remains to be further determined.

notes: ap, apical buds; fr, fibrous roots; ml, mature leaves; sc, stem cambia; yl, young leaves; ys, young stems. all expression data shown were compared with ap. values that were dramatically higher  than those of control are shown in bold font.

changes in h2o <dig> content and ros scavenging enzyme activities
as previous reported, chilling conditions may lead to an accumulation of ros such as hydrogen peroxide  and superoxide radical   <cit> . to analyze and visualize h2o <dig> produced in the cassava leaves subjected to cold stress , diaminobenzidine  was used to stain the first or second fully expanded leaves of in vitro specimens and greenhouse-grown cassava plants. in unstressed leaves, few dab polymerizations could be observed; in contrast, there was a significant increase in dab polymerization detected as early as  <dig> h following cold treatment that continued up to  <dig> h . this result was consistent with the quantification of h2o <dig> content , indicating that the oxidative stress may exert a toxic effect on cassava to adapt or survive under cold stress conditions.

plants, as well as other organisms, have evolved antioxidant systems to protect themselves against toxic species of oxygen. ros scavenging enzymes, including catalase , superoxide dismutase , and glutathione transferase , have been demonstrated to play key roles in the removal of ros. in our degs, several genes encoding ros scavenging enzymes were recorded to be target to chloroplast, including cat <dig> and gstu <dig> . in addition, peroxidase  <dig>  and other three gsts  were also identified . the up-regulation of four ros-scavenging transcripts  was verified by real-time rt-pcr . in arabidopsis, cat <dig> was reported to be induced by cold stress and gstu <dig> was responsive to many biotic and abiotic stresses, such as water deprivation and oxidative stress  <cit> . to further validate the function of ros scavenging enzymes after exposure to cold stress, the activities of cat and sod in cassava leaves subjected to 7°c were measured. consistent with the microarray data, an increase in cat activity was observed after  <dig> h of cold treatment . similarly, a significant elevation in sod activity was also observed after  <dig> h of cold stress, and such increases continued for  <dig> h after the initiation of stress treatment . these results including induction of zat12-like gene  suggested that ros signaling pathways, including ros scavenging enzymes, were involved in the ros detoxification induced by the cold stress response in cassava. similarly, rice and maize, as chilling-sensitive tropical crops, could only withstand transient and milder cold stress. in japonica rice, an oxidative-mediated network has been proposed to play a key role in the early response to chilling stress and short-term defenses  <cit> , and insufficient antioxidant defenses are thought to cause maize chilling sensitivity  <cit> . generally, the ultra-structural changes of the chloroplast  and oxidative burst were typically characteristic of pcd in plants, indicating that pcd may be a part of an adaptive mechanism to survive stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study presented a genome-wide gene expression profiling of cassava subjected to cold stress using the microarray technology. overall, the transcriptomic responses of cassava to cold stress were basically consistent with the changes seen in other plants under abiotic stresses  <cit> . a considerable amount of specific cassava genes related to different biological functions were identified. for examples, many new stress-responsive genes or tfs, such as early flower  <dig>  erf <dig>  and ap <dig> domain transcription factor , were found, suggesting that various regulatory pathways may exist in cassava together with the well-characterized cbf pathway. based on the comprehensive transcriptomic, real-time rt-pcr and physiological analyses, our study supports the fact that crosstalks among different signaling systems play an important role in regulating the cold stress response in tropical plants. thus, a hypothetical model for depicting the components involved in cold response networks in cassava could be established . plants may perceive low temperature through cell membrane receptors, most likely transmembrane proteins, and by membrane modification through fatty acid synthesis . then, the cold signal transduction might induce cellular metabolism changes, such as the calcium signaling cascade, hormone signal transduction, and ros signaling. the calcium signaling pathway may stimulate the calcium ion binding protein, leading to the activation of cascade kinase activities , which could switch on various cold stress-responsive genes and transcription factor family proteins . hormone  signal transduction could also be activated to alter plant growth status in order to adapt to stress condition through the differential regulation of their downstream genes . moreover, other metabolisms could also take part in the process, including starch and sucrose metabolism , amino acid metabolism , and the ros scavenging system . apparently, the balance between cell damage and tolerance might decide the fate for cold-stressed cassava plants . on the other hand, a large number of genes  encode proteins of unknown functions. studying these genes may reveal novel mechanisms that are fundamental to the ability of cassava to cope with cold stress.

in summary, our array study will provide the fundamental knowledge related to the biological and physiological changes of cassava under cold stress. it will also be served as a very useful genetic resource for relevant research community globally. further studies are needed to verify the functions of candidate genes for improving cassava tolerance ability through genetic engineering.
