BACKGROUND
following transcription and processing of an mrna, the ribosome is responsible for performing protein synthesis. although the bacterial 30 s ribosomal subunit can identify the initiation codon through base-pairing between the 3′-end of its <dig> s ribosomal rna subunit and the shine-dalgarno sequence upstream of the initiation codon, the 40 s ribosomal subunit of the eukaryotic 80 s ribosome requires several translation initiation factors  for its binding to an mrna and to identify the initiation codon  <cit> . eif4f, which is composed of eif4e, eif4a, and eif4g, is required to promote 40 s subunit binding to an mrna. while eif4e binds to the 5′-cap structure, eif4a is an atp-dependent rna helicase that hydrolyzes atp in order to unwind secondary structure present in the 5′-leader of an mrna that would otherwise inhibit 40s subunit scanning during its search for the initiation codon  <cit> . the helicase activity of eif4a is enhanced by eif4b which interacts directly with eif4a  <cit> . eif4g is a scaffolding protein that interacts with eif4e, eif4a, eif4b, eif <dig> , and the poly binding protein   <cit> . the interaction of eif4g with eif4e bound to the 5′-cap and pabp bound to the poly tail circularizes an mrna and stimulates translation by promoting 40 s subunit recruitment  <cit> .

eif4a binds to two regions of eif4g that fold into heat  domains, characterized by the presence of antiparallel α-helical hairpins known as heat repeats  <cit> . one heat domain to which eif4a binds is present in the middle region of eif4g  which is required for translation while the second is c-distal  and serves a regulatory function  <cit> . a third, functionally distinct heat domain, present in animal eif4g but absent from plant eif4g, does not bind eif4a but does bind mnk kinase which phosphorylates eif4e during active translation  <cit> . eif4b and pabp also bind to a site within the central region of eif4g that partially overlaps the heat-1/eif4g-mig but they do not bind the heat-2/eif4g-ma <dig> domain  <cit> , demonstrating the functional diversity of the heat-1/eif4g-mig and heat-2/eif4g-ma <dig> domains in their interactions with partner proteins. in addition to eif4g, plants express an eif4f isoform called eifiso4f, which is composed of eifiso4e, eif4a, and eifiso4g  <cit> . the eif4b and pabp interaction sites overlap with the eif4a binding site in the heat-1/eif4g-mig domain of eifiso4g more extensively than in eif4g  <cit> . as a consequence, eif4b and pabp compete with eif4a for binding to the heat-1/eif4g-mig domain of eifiso4g in the absence of the heat-2/eif4g-ma <dig> domain but not in its presence  <cit> .

in addition to eif4g, other proteins containing an ma <dig> domain have been described. the programmed cell death  <dig>  protein is characterized by the presence of two tandem ma <dig> domains that fold into a subtype of heat domains. the n- and c-terminal ma <dig> domains of human pdcd <dig> contain four and three helical hairpins, respectively, while eif4g-ma <dig> contains five helical hairpins  <cit> . from a basal level, pdcd <dig> expression is induced upon programmed cell death in several cell types in mice, including lymphoid and neuronal cells  <cit> . overexpressing pdcd <dig> was unable to induce programmed cell death, suggesting no casual relationship between pdcd <dig> and apoptosis  <cit> . increasing pdcd <dig> expression, however, was sufficient to inhibit tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation while reducing pdcd <dig> expression resulted in a transformation-sensitive phenotype and the promotion of tumor invasion  <cit> . animal pdcd <dig> binds eif4a which inhibits the latter from binding to eif4g-ma <dig>  <cit> . pdcd <dig> inhibits eif4a rna binding and helicase activity and inhibits translation in vivo <cit> . pdcd <dig> binding to eif4a also disrupts the atp-binding site and prevents its conformational transition from a nonproductive open state to a productive closed state  <cit> . pdcd <dig> binding to eif4a is required for its ability to inhibit translation and transformation as disruption of eif4a binding to pdcd <dig> abolishes its effect on both  <cit> . the pdcd <dig> c-terminal ma <dig> domain contacts the n-terminal domain of eif4a using structural features conserved with eif4g-ma <dig> thereby preventing the interaction between eif4a and eif4g-ma <dig> and inhibiting translation initiation  <cit> . the two ma <dig> domains of pdcd <dig> have similar secondary and tertiary structures and either can compete with eif4a in binding eif4g-ma <dig>  <cit> . although both ma <dig> domains of pdcd <dig> are structurally similar as are their eif4a-binding surfaces, the two domains function synergistically to bind eif4a, resulting in a more stable complex with eif4a  <cit> . a single pdcd <dig> ma <dig> domain is sufficient to inhibit translation but both domains are required to compete effectively with eif4g-ma <dig> for binding to eif4a  <cit> . pdcd <dig> also binds eif4g-mig without affecting eif4a binding as they bind to diametrically opposite sides of eif4a  <cit> . binding of pdcd <dig> to eif4g-mig, however, may anchor the binding of eif4a to eif4g-mig thereby preventing its cycling through eif4g as part of its function during translation initiation  <cit> .

pdcd <dig> homologs are present in lower eukaryotes and plants although no pdcd <dig> homolog has been reported in yeast. pdcd <dig> proteins in higher plants are unique in that they contain four tandem ma <dig> domains. higher plants also appear to lack a two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog. one such four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> protein  was reported to bind arabidopsis thaliana ethylene receptors, etr <dig> and ein <dig>  as well as ein <dig>  a downstream component of the ethylene signaling pathway required for the induction of ethylene responses  <cit> . loss of ecip <dig> expression resulted in increased ethylene sensitivity and tolerance to salt  <cit> . thus, like the heat-2/ eif4g-ma <dig> domain of eif4g and eifiso4g, the ma <dig> domains of ecip <dig> are involved in protein-protein interactions. when the pdcd <dig> homolog containing four ma <dig> domains first appeared during plant evolution has not been examined. in this study, we have examined the evolution of plant pdcd4-like proteins from a two ma <dig> domain form in prasinophytes to the appearance of a four ma <dig> domain form in charophytes and land plants and the likely independent appearance of a four ma <dig> domain form in chlamydomonadales. we also examine the expansion and divergence of the pdcd4-like gene family during plant evolution and identify how one distinct gene family member appeared following the evolution of basal angiosperms. how the expansion and divergence of the plant pdcd <dig> gene family might relate to their function as regulators of ethylene responses is also discussed.

RESULTS
ma3-domains are present in multiple proteins in plants
eif4g contains a single ma <dig> domain which in plants, is present at the c-terminus as plant eif4g lacks the heat-3/mnk-binding domain found in animal eif4g . plants express two eif4g isoforms known as eif4g and eifiso4g  <cit> . although eifiso4g is substantially smaller than eif4g, this is largely accounted for by a shorter n-terminal region  <cit> . consequently, eif4g and eifiso4g both contain a c-terminal ma <dig> domain. in arabidopsis, eif4g is encoded by a single gene  whereas eifiso4g is encoded by two genes, eifiso4g <dig> and eifiso4g <dig>   <cit> . another gene  encodes a protein composed largely of a ma <dig> domain that exhibits similarity to the ma <dig> domains of eifiso4g <dig> and eifiso4g <dig> .

in addition to eif4g, animals express pdcd <dig>  which contains two tandem ma <dig> domains  <cit> . a search of higher plants for a similar protein containing two tandem ma <dig> domains failed to identify a plant homolog. however, a search for other mat  proteins identified four genes, i.e., mat <dig> through mat <dig>  that encode proteins containing four tandem ma <dig> domains . mat <dig> was previously described as ecip <dig> which is involved in ethylene signaling and stress tolerance in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . these authors concluded that three such genes were present in the a. thaliana genome but the a. thaliana gene family actually contains four members: mat <dig> , mat <dig> , mat <dig> , and mat <dig> . comparison of the ma <dig> domains from mat5- <dig> with eif4g and eifiso4g revealed conservation of several residues among all ma <dig> domains but only four residues were invariant in all ma <dig> domain proteins . in addition to the invariant residues, the ma <dig> domains of mat5- <dig> exhibited conservation at positions that were, in several instances, distinct from residues conserved among eif4g and eifiso4g proteins , suggesting divergence of ma <dig> domains in mat5- <dig> from those in eif4g and eifiso4g. comparison of the ma <dig> domains of mat5- <dig> suggests that ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> are distinct from ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting duplication of an ancestral two ma <dig> domain protein. that no gene encoding a two ma <dig> domain homolog is present in higher plants supports the possibility of duplication. sequence analysis of the individual ma <dig> domains of mat5- <dig> supported this notion as ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> are more related to one another as are ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> . each ma <dig> domain from mat <dig> was the most divergent from the corresponding ma <dig> domain of mat <dig>  mat <dig>  and mat <dig>  suggesting that the pdcd <dig> gene family expanded during plant evolution and diverged into a mat <dig> subgroup and a mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup .

the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> protein is unique to plants
pdcd <dig> homologs are present throughout angiosperm species and the proteins exhibit considerable conservation both in domain organization and primary sequence . all higher plant pdcd <dig> proteins contain four tandem ma <dig> domains in which ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> and ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> are separated by just over  <dig> residues whereas ma <dig> domains 1– <dig> are separated from ma <dig> domains 3– <dig> by just over half that length. the n-terminus of plant pdcd <dig> proteins is highly variable in length and sequence with no conservation across angiosperms . four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs are present in the bryophyte physcomitrella patens and in the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii , demonstrating that the four ma <dig> domain form of the protein had appeared prior to the evolution of seed plants. a pdcd <dig> homolog is also present in the gymnosperm species picea abies which is conserved with other plant pcdc <dig> homologs . a partial pinus taeda cdna  exhibited high similarity to ma <dig> domains  <dig> through  <dig> of higher plants  suggesting that this gymnosperm species also expresses a four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog. in contrast, only pdcd <dig> homologs containing two ma <dig> domains were found in extensive database searches of animal and lower, non-plant eukaryotic species, indicating that the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog is unique to plants.

the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> protein arose during algal evolution
pdcd <dig> in animals and many lower eukaryotes, including several algal species, contains two ma <dig> domains while the pdcd <dig> homolog in other algal species and land plants contains four ma <dig> domains. this raises the question of when duplication of the two ma <dig> domain protein into a four ma <dig> domain protein may have occurred. examination of the available genome sequences for algae and algal relatives revealed the presence of four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs in more recently evolved green algae such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii and volvox carteri representing the chlamydomonadales but only two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs in algal species of the mamiellales such as micromonas and ostreococcus . only two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs were observed in heterokonts such as the brown alga ectocarpus siliculosus and in algal relatives such as aureococcus anophagefferens, phaeodactylum tricornutum, thalassiisira pseudoonana, phytophthora species, and albugo laibachii .

phylogenetic analysis of ma <dig> domains 1– <dig> and ma <dig> domains 3– <dig> of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> with the two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs from other algae and algal relatives revealed that c. reinhardtii and v. carteri ma <dig> domains 1– <dig> were more similar to the two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homologs of prasinophytes or heterokonts than were ma <dig> domains 3– <dig> . ma <dig> domains 1– <dig> and ma <dig> domain  <dig> of a chlorella variabilis partial pdcd <dig> protein sequence also clustered with the respective ma <dig> domains of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> . these data suggest that the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog in more recently evolved chlorophytes arose from the duplication of a more ancestral, two ma <dig> domain protein and that, following duplication, ma <dig> domains 3– <dig> diverged to a greater extent than did ma <dig> domains 1– <dig> 

if the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri arose from the duplication of a two ma <dig> domain progenitor, any intron present in the gene encoding the progenitor might also have been duplicated during the generation of the four ma <dig> domain form of the protein. the c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> genes contain numerous introns some of which are shared between the two. to determine if any may have predated the duplication, the genomic sequence representing ma <dig> domains  <dig> to  <dig> was compared to ma <dig> domains  <dig> to  <dig> of the pdcd <dig> homologs for both algal species . one intron present in ma <dig> domain  <dig> of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> is present in precisely the corresponding location in the ma <dig> domain  <dig> of the same protein , suggesting that it was present in the ancestor of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri that contained a two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> progenitor gene that underwent duplication and resulted in a copy of the intron at the same location in ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig>  an intron just c-terminal to ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> and another in ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> are in near-identical positions but it is not possible to conclude that these predated the duplication event. nevertheless, the identical position of an intron in ma <dig> domains  <dig> and  <dig> of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> supports the notion that the four ma <dig> domain form of their protein arose through duplication of a two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> progenitor during their evolution.

as land plants did not evolve from chlamydomonadales but rather from charophytes , the appearance of a four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog in c. reinhardtii and v. carteri likely represents an independent event from the appearance of the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog in the land plant lineage. this is because charophytes and chlorophytes  are thought to have derived from a common ancestor that likely contained a two ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> form of the protein that was maintained in older algal lineages  but underwent duplication during later chlorophyte evolution.

thus, examination of charophyte pdcd <dig> homologs might more precisely determine when the four ma <dig> domain form of the protein appeared during the evolution of land plants. although little genome sequence information is available for charophytes, a search of the est database identified a partial pdcd <dig> cdna from chaetosphaeridium globosum, representing the coleochaetophyceae. although the 5′-end of the cdna is truncated, the predicted protein contains ma <dig> domains 2– <dig> and, unlike pdcd <dig> present in c. reinhardtii and v. carteri, the c. globosum homolog shares similarity to the regions between the ma <dig> domains of land plant pdcd <dig> homologs, particularly between the second and third ma <dig> domains  which represents the fusion site during the putative duplication of the two ma <dig> domain form of pdcd <dig>  this similarity between c. globosum pdcd <dig> and higher plants is in stark contrast to the lack of similarity of the region between the second and third ma <dig> domains of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> with higher plants, both in sequence and in length . moreover, the fourth ma <dig> domain of the c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> is interrupted by a sequence not present in c. globosum or higher plant pdcd <dig> homologs. although this insertion likely occurred subsequent to the duplication event that gave rise to the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog in these chlorophytes, the pdcd <dig> of the chlamydomonadales does not contain four uninterrupted ma <dig> domains as a consequence. these data suggest, therefore, that the appearance of a pdcd <dig> protein with four uninterrupted ma <dig> domains predated the colonization of land and occurred during charophyte evolution.

the pdcd <dig> gene family underwent expansion during land plant evolution
the pdcd <dig> homolog in c. reinhardtii and v. carteri is encoded by a single gene as it appears to be in other algae and algal relatives . the pdcd <dig> gene family had expanded to two members by the appearance of early land plants such as p. patens and s. moellendorffii. two members are also present in several dicotyledonous species such as vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa, ricinus communis, medicago truncatula, glycine max, and theobroma cacao whereas three members are present in other dicots such as solanum lycopersicum, gossypium raimondii, thellungiella halophila, and brassica rapa . similarly, two members are present in some monocotyledonous species such as hordeum vulgare and zea mays while other monocots have three members such as sorghum bicolor, brachypodium distachyon, and oryza sativa . in contrast to t. halophila, and b. rapa, the pdcd <dig> gene families of a. thaliana, a. lyrata, and capsella rubella are even larger with each containing four members. the variable size of the gene family among angiosperm species suggests that the expansion from the two gene members present in p. patens and s. moellendorffii occurred in a species-specific manner.

dpartial sequence available suggests the likely presence of four ma <dig> domains.

gene divergence often follows gene duplication. to determine how the plant pdcd <dig> gene family members may have diverged during the evolution of land plants, phylogenetic analysis of the gene family was performed. because of the poor sequence conservation of the n-terminus, only the region containing the four ma <dig> domains was used for the analysis. although the c. globosum sequence is not full-length, it was included to represent a progenitor sequence to land plants. similarly, one of the p. abies pdcd <dig> homologs  is not full-length but was included along with the second p. abies homolog , which is full-length, to represent the two pdcd <dig> gene members of a more recent gymnosperm species.

the single pdcd <dig> gene family members of c. reinhardtii and v. carteri clustered together but not with the c. globosum sequence , which itself is more closely related to the pdcd <dig> homologs of land plants. this observation supports the notion that the four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> arose independently in chlorophytes and charophytes and that the pdcd <dig> homolog of land plants evolved from charophytes. the two pdcd <dig> homologs of p. patens clustered together but the two s. moellendorffii gene members exhibited some degree of divergence as they did not cluster together . in angiosperms, the pdcd <dig> gene family clusters into two distinct orthologous groups . one is represented by the a. thaliana mat <dig> gene  which is more closely related to mat8-like gene members in other dicots such as c. rubella, t. halophila, b. rapa, g. raimondii, t. cacao, g. max, m. truncatula, r. communis, p. trichocarpa, v. vinifera, and s. lycopersicum, as well as in monocots such as o. sativa, s. bicolor, z. mays, h. vulgare, b. distachyon than it is to the other three members of the a. thaliana pdcd <dig> gene family , suggesting that genes in the mat <dig> cluster are true orthologs. regardless of the size of the mat gene family, only one mat <dig> gene is observed in those species in which a mat <dig> homolog is present. in many species examined, the pdcd <dig> gene family is composed of just two members so that there is a single member in each subgroup. in some species, however, there are more than two pdcd <dig> genes and those that are not similar to mat <dig> clustered together. an example is the a. thaliana gene family which, in addition to the single mat <dig> gene, contains three additional members , that are more closely related to one another than to any mat <dig> homolog. as four members are present in c. rubella  and a. lyrata , which cluster similarly to the a. thaliana gene family members, the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup likely underwent gene expansion to three members from the two members of the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup present in t. halophila, and b. rapa . the mat <dig> and mat <dig> subclades contain orthologs from a. lyrata , c. rubella, t. halophila, and b. rapa  whereas the mat <dig> subclade contains orthologs only from a. lyrata and c. rubella, data suggesting that mat <dig> is likely the newest member of the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup that appeared after the separation of arabidopsis/capsella from brassica. the two g. raimondii pdcd <dig> homologs in the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup exhibit considerable similarity , suggesting a relatively recent gene duplication event that produced these paralogs. a similar expansion of the pdcd <dig> gene family occurred in some monocot species such as o. sativa, s. bicolor, and b. distachyon, each of which contains two genes within the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup . in these species, however, the two gene members in the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup cluster into two distinct clades, suggesting that gene duplication occurred prior to speciation.

these data suggest that the two genes produced from the duplication of the original pdcd <dig> gene during early higher plant evolution might have been the progenitor genes for mat <dig> and the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroups and the latter subgroup underwent expansion in some species. however, the considerable similarity of the two pdcd <dig> homologs in p. patens suggests that gene duplication occurred relatively recently in this species. in contrast, the two homologs in s. moellendorffii have diverged suggesting an earlier gene duplication event. the two gene members of p. patens and s. moellendorffii are sufficiently different from the mat <dig> and mat5/6/ <dig> subgroups that it is not possible to assign them to either subgroup. moreover, the gymnosperm pdcd <dig> homologs cluster in a subclade that is separate from the mat <dig> and mat5/6/ <dig> subgroups, including the two homologs of p. abies, suggesting that the gymnosperm pdcd <dig> homologs have diverged from angiosperms homologs. no mat <dig> homolog was identified in basal angiosperm species as the pdcd <dig> homologs in the basal angiosperms amborella trichopoda, austrobaileya scandens, and illicium floridanum are more similar to the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup than the mat <dig> subgroup . a mat8-like homolog was identified in aristolochia elegans and eschscholzia californica in addition to mat5/6/7-like homologs . these observations suggest that mat <dig> subgroup is not present in basal angiosperms but appeared at or prior to the evolution of species within the piperales such as a. elegans.

the pdcd <dig> homologs in cycas micholitz and sundacarpus amarus contain deletions in each ma <dig> domain relative to the early land plants and angiosperms , perhaps suggesting a unique feature of gymnosperm pdcd <dig> homologs. however, examination of the p. abies and p. taeda pdcd <dig> homologs revealed that they are similar to more recently evolved angiosperm species in that the deletions present in c. micholitz and s. amarus are not present in the ma <dig> domains of p. abies  and p. taeda . moreover, examination of the pdcd <dig> homologs of the basal angiosperms a. trichopoda, a. scandens, and i. floridanum revealed that they too contain deletions in each ma <dig> domain that are identical to those observed in c. micholitz and s. amarus . however, the pdcd <dig> homologs of a. elegans and more recently evolved angiosperm species do not share these deletions .

to examine if the deletions in each ma <dig> domain affect the same region, the individual ma <dig> domains from a. thaliana mat <dig> and the basal angiosperm a. trichopoda were aligned. nearly the same two regions deleted in the first ma <dig> domain of a. trichopoda were also missing in the second ma <dig> domain . similarly, nearly the same two regions deleted in the third ma <dig> domain of a. trichopoda were also missing in the fourth ma <dig> domain, although these were not conserved with the deleted regions in the first two ma <dig> domains . as the early evolved gymnosperm species share precisely the same deletions as the basal angiosperm species, the observations of a. trichopoda apply to these gymnosperm species as well.

as these deletions are not present in the early land plants p. patens and s. moellendorffii but appear in the early lineage of both gymnosperms and angiosperms only to disappear again during subsequent evolution of each lineage, the most parsimonious explanation is that the deletions in the ma <dig> domains of early evolved gymnosperm and angiosperm species likely occurred independently in the evolution of these species as they branched from the ancestral gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. it is also formally possible that the deletions appeared subsequent to early land plant evolution but prior to the appearance of the distinct gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages only to disappear again during the subsequent evolution of each lineage although this possibility would seem less likely. despite the deletions present in the basal angiosperm pdcd <dig> homologs, they are more similar to the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup than the mat <dig> subgroup , supporting the conclusion that the mat <dig> member of the pdcd <dig> gene family evolved following basal angiosperm evolution and is specific to more recently evolved angiosperm species.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
these results suggest that the domain organization of pdcd <dig> homologs in most lower plants, i.e., algae and algal relatives, is similar to those in animals in that it contains two ma <dig> domains but it underwent duplication to a four ma <dig> domain form in some recently evolved chlorophytes such as c. reinhardtii and v. carteri and, independently, in at least one charophyte such as c. globosum. that land plants did not evolve from chlorophytes, particularly from those species that contain a four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> homolog, supports the possibility of an independent duplication event during charophyte evolution. the sequence similarity between higher plant and c. globosum pdcd <dig> homologs at the fusion site between ma <dig> domain  <dig> and  <dig> and the significant sequence difference between higher plant and c. reinhardtii and v. carteri pdcd <dig> homologs in this same region further supports this conclusion. in addition to the duplication of pdcd <dig> from a protein containing two ma <dig> domains to a protein containing four ma <dig> domains, the pdcd <dig> gene family expanded from a single member in algae to two or more members upon colonization of land and the evolution of higher plants. the expansion of the gene family occurred early during higher plant evolution as evidenced by the two member gene family present in bryophytes and lycophytes with additional expansion of the gene family in some higher plant species that appears to have occurred in a species-specific manner.

the pdcd <dig> homologs of the angiosperm species examined have diverged into mat8-like and mat5/6/7-like subgroups. no mat <dig> homolog was identified in gymnosperm or basal angiosperm species, but appeared at or prior to the evolution of species within the piperales such as a. elegans, suggesting that the mat <dig> homolog is an angiosperm-specific member that evolved after the appearance of the most basal angiosperm species. although no further expansion of the gene family appears to have occurred within the mat <dig> subgroup as only one gene encoding a mat8-like homolog was observed in those species whose pdcd <dig> gene family included a mat8-like member, additional expansion did occur in the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup in some dicot and monocot species in a species-specific manner resulting in the paralogs observed in this subgroup. for example, orthologs of a. thaliana mat <dig> are found in a. lyrata and c. rubella but not in t. halophila and b. rapa, suggesting it appeared following the separation of arabidopsis/capsella from brassica. other recent gene duplication events may have occurred in p. patens and g. raimondii. in contrast, the expansion of the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup in some monocots such as o. sativa, s. bicolor, and b. distachyon predated their speciation as each contains two genes within the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup which cluster into two distinct clades. all pdcd <dig> homologs identified in basal angiosperm species were mat5/6/7-like, supporting the conclusion that this form of pdcd <dig> evolved prior to the appearance of mat8-like homologs.

interestingly, the pdcd <dig> homologs in early evolved gymnosperm and angiosperm species possess two deletions within each ma <dig> domain relative to early land plants. the observation that these deletions are present in both early evolved gymnosperm and angiosperm species supports the notion that they occurred prior to the appearance of the distinct gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. however, the fact that these deletions are not observed in angiosperm species since  the evolution of a. elegans and are not present in more recently evolved gymnosperm species such as p. abies and p. taeda, suggests that these deletions in the pdcd <dig> homologs of early evolved gymnosperm and angiosperm species likely occurred independently during the evolution of these species after they branched from the ancestral gymnosperm and angiosperm lineages. if they did occur independently in early gymnosperm and angiosperm species, it would suggest convergent evolution which may have been driven by the deletion of structural or functional elements within each ma <dig> domain that may have conferred an advantage to these species. the importance of the deleted regions within each ma <dig> domain is unknown but the elucidation of their structural or functional impact on the ma <dig> domains will provide insight into the adaption of pdcd <dig> proteins in early evolved gymnosperm and angiosperm species.

these observations collectively raise the question of what advantage does a four ma <dig> domain pdcd <dig> protein confer to recently evolved algal species and land plants and what advantage does expansion of the pdcd <dig> gene family confer to plants as they transitioned from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment? loss of expression of just one of the four pdcd <dig> proteins in a. thaliana was sufficient to alter ethylene sensitivity and tolerance to salt  <cit> . the ability of mat <dig>  to bind ethylene receptors and the ein <dig> signaling component, suggests that plant pdcd <dig> may regulate ethylene signaling which in turn regulates responses to abiotic stresses such as salt  <cit> . whether plant pdcd <dig> may interact also with eif4a to inhibit protein synthesis as has been reported for animal pdcd <dig> remains to be determined. moreover, its function in programmed cell death in plants has not been examined. an interesting correlation, however, is the presence in land plants and their closest algal relatives of a pdcd <dig> protein containing four uninterrupted ma <dig> domains with components involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signaling including homologs to the etr <dig> and ein <dig> ethylene receptors and the ein <dig> downstream signaling component to which mat <dig> binds  <cit> . this raises the intriguing possibility that the appearance of the four ma <dig> domain protein may represent the evolution of a protein involved in programmed cell death to one involved in abiotic stress-related hormone signaling similar to the evolution of ethylene receptors from two-component environmental sensor regulators  <cit> . the expansion of the pdcd <dig> gene family may have provided specificity of function if different pdcd <dig> isoforms are involved in different pathways or interact with different receptors within a single pathway such as in ethylene signaling. this would be particularly important following colonization of land which presents a more diverse array of stress conditions, such as desiccation, uv radiation, and temperature fluctuations, than would be present in many aquatic environments. arabidopsis species contain five distinct ethylene receptors and mat <dig>  interacts with just two of these, i.e., etr <dig> and ein <dig> . whether other members of the pdcd <dig> gene family exhibit different specificities in their interactions with ethylene receptors, ein <dig>  or other proteins remains to be determined but the divergence of the mat <dig> subgroup and the mat5/6/ <dig> subgroup might provide the basis for any functional specificity that exists within this family.
