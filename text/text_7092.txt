BACKGROUND

escherichia coli  are group of bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals commensally, often without pathogenic effects to the animals. most e. coli strains are also non-pathogenic to humans but detection of e. coli in foods intended for human consumption shows poor in hygiene during production, processing or preparation. ultimately, detection of e. coli in food is indicative of fecal contamination and presence of other dangerous pathogenic microorganisms which can compromise the health and wellbeing of consumers. in addition to hygienic indicator, some strains of e. coli are directly pathogenic to humans. the best example is shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  which can cause severe enteric infections. symptoms of stec o <dig> infection may include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . in this respect, numerous sporadic infections and outbreaks caused by stec o <dig> have been reported worldwide in many countries. the majority of steco <dig> infections are food borne more specifically associated with cattle sources. historically, stec o <dig> was first linked to outbreaks of severe bloody diarrhea in  <dig>  and is often referred to as a “recently emerged” human pathogen  <cit> . microbiologically culture proven e. coli o <dig> diarrheal cases have been reported from a number of african countries including south africa, swaziland, central african republic, kenya, uganda gabon, nigeria and ivory coast  <cit> .

in developing countries, including ethiopia, animals are commonly slaughtered and dressed under unhygienic conditions and this further compromises the microbiological quality and safety of the meat obtained from the animals  <cit> . this can consequently risk the health of consumers. in the presence of all the above situations, so far there are only few studies which addressed to assess the prevalence and distribution of e. coli o157:h <dig> in humans, animals or in foods of animal origin in ethiopia . therefore, the objectives of the present study were:  to isolate and identify e. coli o157:h <dig> from cattle feces, carcasses and contact surfaces at abattoir and butcher shops,  to determine to what extent the abattoirs and butcher house environments serve as sources of e. coli o175:h <dig> and  to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates.

RESULTS
occurrence of e. coli o157:h7
result of the occurrence of e. coli o157:h <dig> is depicted in table  <dig>  of the total  <dig> samples examined,  <dig> were positive for e. coli using selective culture  and biochemical tests . upon further screening using rainbow agar o <dig>  out of  <dig> isolates  <dig> of them were found to be presumptively e. coli o157:h <dig>  finally, confirmation using omnilog identification system resulted in  <dig> samples positive for e. coli o157:h <dig> with overall prevalence of  <dig> % . when disaggregated according to the types of samples examined, the specimens positive for e. coli o157:h <dig> were: feces , carcass swabs , meat  and cutting board swab . there was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of e. coli o157:h <dig> between butcher houses and abattoir , assuming e. coli o157:h <dig> positive animal when the bacterium is detected only in faecal sample. though fecal sample is considered as source of carcass contamination, statistically significant difference was not observed .table  <dig> isolation frequency of e. coli o157:h <dig> from different sample types in abattoir and butcher shops, hawassa, southern ethiopia




the prevalence of e. coli o157:h <dig> at animal level was  <dig> %  . carcass swab of e. coli o157: h <dig> statuses were considered as indicator of contamination and were not used for the calculation of prevalence at animal level . there was no statistically significant difference  in the prevalence of e. coli o157:h <dig> between sex, origin and breed. however, there was statistically significant difference  in the occurrence of e. coli o157:h <dig> between age groups , in which higher prevalence was found in age group of ≥ 7 years than younger animals.table  <dig> association of different risk factors with e. coli o157:h <dig> occurrence at animal level




susceptibility of the isolates to different antimicrobials
subjecting of the  <dig> isolates of e. coli o157:h <dig> to various antimicrobials resulted in different susceptibility patterns. the isolates were found to be 100% susceptible to gentamycin , ceftriaxone , nalidixic acid  kanamycin  and cefotaxime .the result showed a decreased susceptibility pattern of the isolates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid  , tetracycline   and streptomycin  . the details of susceptibility and resistance pattern of all isolates of e. coli o157:h <dig> are described in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> antimicrobial susceptibility profile of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> isolated from abattoir and butcher shops in hawassa





discussion
human infections of e. coli o157:h <dig> have mostly been recognized to be originated from animal source foods  <cit> . domestic ruminants, mainly cattle, sheep, and goats, have been established as major natural reservoirs for stec and play a significant role in the epidemiology of human infections  <cit> . in the present study, presence of e. coli o157:h <dig> on carcasses suggests transfer of fecal material onto the carcass during the slaughter process, which may suggest that currently available dressing procedures at the abattoir cannot be reliable to prevent fecal contamination during slaughtering.

observed prevalence of e. coli o157:h <dig> at abattoir level  is in line with the findings from ethiopia  <cit> , south africa  <cit> , united kingdom  <cit>  and ireland  <cit>  which reported  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. compared with the present study, higher prevalence of e. coli o157:h <dig> have been also reported  among the different age groups. observed variation in prevalence among studies could be attributed to difference in sampling and isolation procedures, variability in sampled populations, diverse geographical origins of cattle, numbers of cattle, study design, season, abattoir conditions and treatment with antimicrobial substances during the process .

the higher occurrence of e. coli o157:h7in feces of the slaughtered animals when compared with carcass swabs in the present study is in line with the findings at manhattan abattoir   <cit>  and in great britain   <cit> . studies have also showed that prevalence of e. coli o157:h <dig> shed from animal feces can vary significantly in relation to time, age of animals and nature of feeds  <cit> .

in the present study, all of the  <dig> isolates were found to be entirely susceptible to ceftriaxone , cefotaxime , gentamycin , kanamycin  and nalidixic acid . this is in agreement with previous studies from ethiopia  <cit> . however, a study conducted in saudi arabia revealed that there was resistant strain to nalidixic acid , cefotaxime , and gentamycin   <cit> . this variation probably attributed to the expression of resistant gene code by the pathogen which is associated with emerging and re-emerging aspects of the isolates with regards to different agro ecology  <cit> . on the other hand, in the present study more than half of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin . this might be due to inappropriate or excessive use of antibiotics for therapeutic and prophylactic purpose both for e. coli and other infections.

in our present study, we used omnilog system which is comparable to molecular techniques. omnilog system use redox  reaction which enables testing of gram negative and gram positive bacteria in the same test panel. actually it would have been good to use a molecular test  which is more accurate than omnilog but this could not be realized due to resource constraints at the time of the study.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the occurrence of e. coli o157:h <dig> in apparently healthy slaughtered cattle with some antimicrobial resistance pattern suggests a potential risk to public health. the presence of e. coli o157:h7in fecal sample followed by carcass swab highly suggests unhygienic practices in the abattoir and the poor hygiene is the key source of microbial contamination of the meat. our study calls for developing preventive approach to control e. coli o157:h <dig> contamination in meat production chain by imposing strict hygienic meat processing practices in hawassa municipal abattoir. this can be done by ensuring good hygienic practice, good manufacturing practice and if possible hazard analysis of critical control points  at every stage of the beef supply chain, from the farm, through the abattoir, to the butcher houses, and those involved with the handling and processing. further investigations using molecular typing should be conducted.
