BACKGROUND
trace amine associated receptors  are a family of g-protein coupled receptors that originated prior to the emergence of jawed vertebrates  <cit> . the most widely studied of these receptors is taar <dig>  which has been shown to bind a wide spectrum of biogenic amines and psychoactive compounds  <cit>   and is a known modulator of monoaminergic activity  <cit> . trace amines themselves have proven elusive to understand; the only receptors that they have been found to bind to are taar <dig>  <cit>  and taar <dig>   <cit> , though they also appear to be substrates at various monoamine transporters and catabolic enzymes  <cit> .

taar <dig> expression in brain is observed in a variety of species including human  <cit> , rhesus macaque  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , and rat  <cit>  with its distribution widespread. notably, expression overlaps with regions important in brain monoaminergic function and co-expression of taar <dig> and the dopamine transporter  has been observed in dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . studies replacing taar <dig> with lacz in knock-out mice support these findings with the staining of brain sections in these mice displaying lacz expression throughout dopaminergic and serotonergic regions  <cit> . these findings, coupled with a dysregulation of trace amines in psychiatric disease  <cit> , have made understanding the function of this gene particularly relevant.

though the taar gene family is present in some form in all jawed vertebrates, the number of genes observed in any given species varies considerably  <cit> . while the placental mammalian ancestor is thought to have harbored nine distinct taar genes, even within this relatively recent clade there has been significant gene gain and loss; mouse, rat, and cow have added to the repertoire, while primates and dog have seen losses  <cit> . functional work on members of the taar gene family other than taar <dig> is sparse, but what has been done suggests that other taar gene products do not bind the traditional taar <dig> ligands )  <cit> , but instead show a distinct ligand set related to environmental perception  <cit> . expression studies fail to find broad expression of these other taar family members in the brain but rather observe localization predominantly in the olfactory apparatus  <cit> .

this functional dichotomy between taar <dig> and its cousins is significant. while other members of the taar gene family have seen recurrent pseudogenization and duplication, taar <dig> has been evolutionarily stable. taar <dig> was the first to arise and remains the only taar gene present in every species studied with the possible exception of the neotelost fish who nevertheless harbors another, evolutionarily similar, taar <dig> cousin  <cit> . yet, despite this conservation, taar <dig> shows sequence divergence across species and species-specific pharmacological profiles with drug potency  differences of 10-fold or more common  <cit> . while it remains unclear what practical effect these differences have in vivo, it is noteworthy that this variation exists, despite the conservation of the gene itself and its unique evolutionary history.

in order to better understand the evolutionary context in which this receptor family evolved and to better grasp its likely functional significance we have explored the relationship of various taar homologs in twenty mammals, a marsupial, a monotreme and an outgroup avian. we have characterized the gain and loss of taar homologs among mammals and performed evolutionary analyses to better understand the selective constraints under which they operate. we have also more fully investigated the evolutionary history of taar <dig> with a focus on the carnivores and the functional implications of a loss of taar <dig> in dogs.

RESULTS
initially we gathered all reported taar homologs from eleven species for whom annotated genomic sequence was available , sequence confirmed the genomic data available for rhesus macaque, macaca mulatta, and identified putative orangutan  homologs through trans-alignments with the as yet unannotated genomic sequence.

computationally annotated genomic sequences are currently focused on identifying intact genes and exclude pseudogenes. as such, for many of the species for whom genomic sequences were relied upon only whole and intact genes were identified.  we then aligned, in frame, the identified genes, calculated evolutionary parameters and generated a phylogenetic tree using raxml  <cit> . this resulting phylogram largely mirrors the previously identified relationships between the trace amine associated receptors  <cit>  and species relationships . the incongruencies that exist are simply explained by a paucity of mutations reflective of a small physical region and short evolutionary time. beyond the nine ancestral taars, expansions have been species specific  and we observe no evidence for paralogs shared between species . however, taar <dig> and taar <dig> in placental mammals themselves appear to be alloparalogous sharing a single ancestral ortholog with marsupials. this ancestor of mammalian taar <dig> and taar <dig> we tentatively call taar6l8l  and has seen apparent duplications in the opossum lineage. we further identify an opossum specific gene that appears to serve as an outgroup to all taars, tentatively called taarl . further investigation of these marsupial taar genes will be required to understand their functional and evolutionary relevance.

we also considered the relative rate of amino acid fixation  among the lineages. without exception, all lineages showed dn/ds values less than one indicative of negative, purifying, selection . because of the observed differences between ligands and expression patterns associated with taar <dig> as compared to other family members, we performed a branches test to identify if there was a significant difference between the dn/ds values among taar <dig> genes compared to other family members. interestingly there was a significant difference  but with taar <dig> showing an elevated, though still purifying, dn/ds of  <dig>  compared to the remainder of the family at a dn/ds of  <dig> . we compared this to the taar <dig> clade which also is robustly conserved without pseudogenization. taar <dig> is evolutionarily statistically indistinguishable from other taar family members.

to more thoroughly investigate the gain and loss of taar genes and their relevance to human behavior and disease, we interrogated the entire family repertoire of humans, chimpanzees, orangutans, rhesus macaques, and marmosets as well as tamarin and squirrel monkey sequences for which amplicons were successful. previous studies had noted numerous pseudogenization events in the evolution of human and chimpanzee taars  <cit>  and this finding appeared to be generalized across primates with pseudogenes common among orangutans, rhesus macaques, and marmosets as well. a tree depicting the relationships among primate taars is shown in figure  <dig> with pseudogenes noted. the data remains too incomplete to adequately model birth-and-death processes, however, and will likely require more complete identification of entire taar gene complements among all mammals for conclusion. two genes, however, are conserved and intact among all five primate species, taar <dig> and taar <dig>  these findings suggest these genes explicitly as the most likely to be implicated in disease phenotypes among the gene family.

taar <dig> and taar <dig> also seem to be the most conserved broadly across all the species studied, but while taar <dig> is intact for all mammalian species in which it has been identified, our interrogations of the published dog genomes found taar <dig> to be a pseudogene. indeed, complete and conserved coding regions for taar <dig> were identified for all mammals under study with the exception of the dog which had several frame-shift mutations apparently rendering it a pseudogene. in-frame insertion/deletions can be seen in several species , but these are all localized to the third intracellular domain. overall divergence values for the gene across all species are broadly representative of expected mutation rates. using maximum likelihood based methods we reconstructed putative ancestral sequences and probed the tree for evidence of positive selection. as shown in figure  <dig>  dn/ds values for all branches were below  <dig> indicative of negative selection at work on the gene. lineages that displayed even moderately higher dn/ds values tended to be shorter and indicative more of stochastic noise rather than obscured signal. further, there was no evidence of positive selection at either the level of individual codons. the third intracellular domain and the third extracellular domain showed moderately higher levels of amino acid divergence as compared with other regions in the gene, though still without approaching levels anticipated through positive selection . this is perhaps unsurprising given that among taar family genes as a whole these regions tend to be the least conserved  <cit> .

while taar <dig> is under purifying selection across a diverse group of mammals, this does not appear to be the case for dog. sequence obtained from the dog genome shows several frame shift mutations in the orthologous taar <dig> region. dog genomes produced by public and private efforts on two different breeds of dog, boxer and poodle showed no differences between the breeds, nor did we find any difference when we separately amplified and sequenced the dog taar <dig> from genomic dna isolated from mdck cells, a cell line derived from the kidney of a cocker spaniel. further interrogation of the dog genome using feline, murine, or human taar <dig> confirmed the orthology of the canine taar <dig> pseudogene and failed to find evidence of a duplication event. to determine whether the loss of taar <dig> was coincident with the canine domestication event, we also sequenced taar <dig> from three wild gray wolf populations, but again found identical sequences to those from domesticated dog. guided by carnivore phylogeny  <cit> , we surveyed taar <dig> in four additional caniform carnivores. wolf-like canids  and south american canids  showed the same pseudogenization markers as was observed for the dog and wolf. because taar <dig> is intact in cats, the pseudogenization event seems to have occurred prior to the divergence of the tribe canini but subsequent to the divergence from the feliforms .

while taar <dig> is inactivated in dogs, it is not certain that its function has been lost. while analysis of the dog genome failed to identify a specific recent duplication event of taar <dig>  it did identify two other taar family members with intact coding regions and so it is conceivable, if unlikely, that a compensatory functional change may have appeared. it is also notable that the dog genome, in its current state, remains incomplete. while the taar <dig> genomic region maps to a chromosome with flanking genes  identical to the genes that flank the taar regions in other species, taar <dig>  taar <dig>  and taar <dig> map to a contig that has not been assembled onto a chromosome. taar <dig>  taar <dig>  taar <dig>  taar <dig>  and taar <dig> homologs are not readily apparent in the dog genome though several large gaps exist in the region downstream of the taar2/4/ <dig> cluster where taar6/7/8/ <dig> would be expected. in all the dog genome assemblies, the taar locus is far from finished quality. because of this we sought to determine whether taar <dig> functionality, if not taar <dig> itself, could be observed in dogs.

to do so, we used an established assay for taar <dig> functionality in brain synaptosomes that distinguishes between the presence and absence of a functional taar <dig> receptor  <cit> . the assay uses  <dig> nm dopamine as a tracer combined with  <dig> nm β-pea as the taar <dig> agonist  <cit> . an enhanced uptake inhibition by dat occurs in taar <dig> and dat co-transfected cell lines or striatal synaptosomes where taar <dig> is present, but not in cell lines without taar <dig> or in synaptosomes derived from taar <dig> knock-out mice. notably, this response is robust to species differences, with similar results shown in cell lines, old world and new world monkey synaptosomes, and mouse synaptosomes  <cit> . here, we show that in fresh striatal brain synaptosomes from dog, wild-type mouse and taar <dig> knock-out mouse,  <dig> nm dopamine alone or  <dig> nm dopamine and  <dig> nm β-pea was taken up specifically by dat over time. consistent with our previous findings  <cit> , synaptosomes prepared from the wild-type mouse showed an enhanced dopamine uptake inhibition initiating after  <dig> minutes when β-pea was present, while this effect was not observed in synaptosomes prepared from taar <dig> knock-out mice. synaptosomes derived from dog striatum responded to the treatment similar to those prepared from the taar <dig> knock-out mice, strongly suggesting the functional absence of taar <dig> .

two groups have separately created taar <dig> knockout mice and not only are these mice fully viable, but the mice show no gross physical or behavioral abnormalities and identification of any non-pharmacologically induced phenotype has not been forthcoming  <cit> . yet the conservation of the gene for the last  <dig> million years across numerous species belies an importance. concurrent with a role as a monoaminergic modulator, knock-out mice show changes in their dopaminergic system compared to wild types including increased high-affinity dopamine receptor d <dig> <cit>  and higher neuronal firing rates in the ventral tegmental area  <cit> , which is important in brain reward circuitry  <cit> . it may be noteworthy then that while the d <dig> receptor antagonist pimozide does not change the self-administration of β-pea in dogs  <cit> , it does block β-pea induced locomotion in mice  <cit> . further, while the self-administration of β-pea in dogs is unaffected by the d <dig> antagonist, it increases self-administration of amphetamine both in dogs  <cit>  and rats  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our understanding of neuroaminergic signaling has recently become more complicated with the emergence of the taar gene family. these genes represent a heretofore unexplored mechanism of neuromodulation. they have gained a further importance with findings suggesting an association with schizophrenia  <cit> . in these studies we catalog the taar family members across mammals, demonstrating a pattern of pseudogenization and duplication among most of the family members. in primates particularly, only two members, taar <dig> and taar <dig>  are completely conserved, suggesting perhaps a greater importance for these genes. yet despite this evolutionary flux there seems to be a strong purifying selection across all intact genes.

both because of its conservation as well as the fact that only it binds neurotransmitters, taar <dig> has proven particularly interesting. indeed taar <dig> knock-out mouse may show some of the same endophenotypes as schizophrenic patients  <cit>  and have been touted as a model system. yet here we demonstrate that there exist naturally occurring taar <dig> knockouts: dogs and their close relatives. among these species there does not appear to be an intact open reading frame and ex vivo studies show effects similar to those seen in taar <dig> knockout mice. yet it remains unclear what, if any effects, this loss of function has had. while it is tantalizing to speculate that many behavioral characteristics of dogs, including their relative ease of training, may involve reward encoding and perception, and suggest that this is related to taar <dig> effects on the dopamine system, it remains unproven. indeed, any association between dog behavior and taar <dig> functional loss must also account for the other canini species.

that dogs and their brethren can well tolerate the loss of taar <dig> despite its evolutionary conservation must provoke questions as to the relevance of the gene to schizophrenia or other mental health diseases. while it has been suggested that perhaps another member of the trace amine associated receptor family is contributory to the schizophrenic phenotype  <cit> , the widespread loss of taar genes suggests an evolutionary lability that seems contraindicative. rather the ligand binding studies suggest a dichotomy between taar <dig> and the remainder of the family that is broadly supported by the observed differences in gene phylogenies. the suggestion from rodents that taar family members other than taar <dig> are related to chemosensory perception  <cit>  is bolstered by these findings as well. the patterns of species-specific duplications and pseudogenization events are reminiscent of that seen for olfactory genes  <cit> .

this work demonstrates the strengths of applying evolutionary studies to functional analyses. from the phylogenies of the taar genes, taar <dig> appears qualitatively different in its pattern of gene gain and loss. this coupled with our knowledge of taar ligand binding suggests a dichotomy of function among the receptors. at the same time the tolerance of loss of taar <dig> in dogs offers a warning for association studies with disease; the subtleties of effect must be considered. understanding the paradox of evolutionarily ancient conservation and an accommodation of recent loss will shed significant light on neuroaminergic biology and the genetic basis underlying brain and behavior.
