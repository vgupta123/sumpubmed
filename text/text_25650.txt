BACKGROUND
approaches for quantitative trait locus  mapping were developed originally for experimental crosses, such as the backcross, double haploid, rils or f <dig>  derived from inbred lines  <cit> . because of the homozygosity of inbred lines, the mendelian segregation of all markers each with two alternative alleles in such crosses can be observed directly. in practice, there is also a group of species of great economical and environmental importance - out-crossing species, such as forest trees, in which traditional qtl mapping approaches cannot be appropriately used. for these species, it is difficult or impossible to generate inbred lines due to long generation intervals and high heterozygosity  <cit> , although experimental hybrids have been commercially used in practical breeding programs.

for a given outbred line, some markers may be heterozygous, whereas others may be homozygous over the genome. all markers may, or may not, have the same allele system between any two outbred lines used for a cross. also, for a pair of heterozygous loci, their allelic configuration along two homologous chromosomes  cannot be observed from the segregation pattern of genotypes in the cross  <cit> . unfortunately, a consistent number of alleles across different markers and their known linkage phases are the prerequisites for statistical mapping approaches described for the backcross or f <dig>  grattapaglia and sederoff  <cit>  proposed a so-called pseudo-test backcross strategy for linkage mapping in a controlled cross between two outbred parents. this strategy is powerful for the linkage analysis of those testcross markers that are heterozygous in one parent and null in the other, although it fails to consider many other marker cross types, such as intercross markers and dominant markers, that occur for an outbred cross. maliepaard et al.  <cit>  derived numerous formulas for estimating the linkage between different types of markers by correctly determining the linkage phase of markers. a general model has been developed for simultaneous estimation of the linkage and linkage phase for any marker cross type in outcrossing populations  <cit> . stam  <cit>  wrote powerful software for integrating genetic linkage maps using different types of markers.

statistical methods for qtl mapping in a full-sib family of outcrossing species have not received adequate attention. lin et al.  <cit>  developed a model that takes into account uncertainties about the number of alleles across the genome. wu et al.  <cit>  used this model to reanalyze a full-sib family data for poplar trees  <cit> , leading to the detection of new qtls for biomass traits which were not discovered by traditional approaches. with increasing recognition of the role of epistasis in controlling and maintaining quantitative variation  <cit> , it is crucial to extend lin et al.'s model to map the epistatic of qtls by which to elucidate a detailed and comprehensive perspective on the genetic architecture of a quantitative trait. however, the well-established theory and model for epistasis are mostly based on biallelic genes  <cit>  and their estimation and test are made for a pedigree derived from inbred lines  <cit> . until now, no models and algorithms have been available for characterizing the epistasis of multiallelic qtls in an outcrossing population.

in this article, we will extend the theory for biallelic epistasis to model the epistasis between different qtls each with multiple alleles. the multiallelic epistatic theory is then implemented into a statistical model for qtl mapping based on a mixture model. we have derived a closed form for the estimation of the main and interactive effects of multiallelic qtls within the em framework. our model allows geneticists to test the effects of individual genetic components on trait variation. the estimating model has been investigated through simulation studies and validated by an example of qtl mapping for poplar trees  <cit> . the algorithm has been packed to a newly developed package of software, 3funmap, derived to map qtls in a full-sib family  <cit> .

quantitative genetic model
additive-dominance model
randomly select two heterozygous lines as parents p <dig> and p <dig> to produce a full-sib family, in which a qtl will form four genotypes if the two lines have completely different allele systems. let μuv be the value of a qtl genotype inheriting allele u  from parent p <dig> and allele v  from parent p <dig>  based on quantitative genetic theory, this genotypic value can be partitioned into the additive and dominant effects as follows:

  μuv=μ+αu+βv+γuv, 

where μ is the overall mean, αu and βv are the allelic  effects of allele u and v, respectively, and γuv is the interaction  effect at the qtl. considering all possible alleles and allele combinations between the two parent, there are a total of four additive effects . but these additive and dominant effects are not independent and, therefore, are not estimable. after parameterization, there are two independent additive effects, α = α <dig> = -α <dig> and β <dig> = β <dig> = -β <dig>  and one dominant effect, γ = γ <dig> = -γ <dig> = -γ <dig> = γ <dig>  to be estimated.

let u =  <dig> ×  <dig> and a = t, which can be connected by a design matrix d. we have

 u=da, 

where

 d=111111-1-11-11-11-1- <dig>  

the expression of a can be obtained from the expression of u by

  a=d-1u. 

additive-dominance-epistatic model
if there are two segregating qtl in the full-sib family, the epistatic effects due to their nonallelic interactions should be considered. the theory for epistasis in an inbred family  <cit>  can be readily extended to specify different epistatic components for outbred crosses. consider two epistatic multiallelic qtl, each of which has four different genotypes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the outbred progeny. let μu1v1∕u2v <dig> be the genotypic value for qtl genotype u1v1/u2v <dig> for u <dig> u <dig> =  <dig>  and v <dig> v <dig> =  <dig>  and u= be the corresponding mean vector. the two-qtl genotypic value is partitioned into different components as follows:

  μu1v1∕u2v2=μ+α1+β1+γ1+α2+β2+γ2+iαα+iαβ+iβα+iββ+jαγ+jβγ+kγα+kγβ+lγγ 

where

 μ is the overall mean;

 α <dig> is the additive effect due to the substitution from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl;

 β <dig> is the additive effect due to the substitution from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl;

 γ <dig> is the dominant effect due to the interaction between alleles from different parents;

 α <dig> is the additive effect due to the substitution from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 β <dig> is the additive effect due to the substitution from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 γ <dig> is the dominant effect due to the interaction between alleles from different parents;

 iαα is the additive × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first and second qtls;

 iαβ is the additive × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl and from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 iβα is the additive × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the sub-stitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl and from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 iαβ is the additive × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the sub-stitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first and second qtls;

 jαγ is the additive × dominant epistatic effect due to the interaction between the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl and the dominant effect at the second qtl;

 jβγ is the additive × dominant epistatic effect due to the interaction between the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the first qtl and the dominant effect at the second qtl;

 kγα is the dominant × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the dominant effect at the first qtl and the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 kγβ is the dominant × additive epistatic effect due to the interaction between the dominant effect at the first qtl and the substitutions from allele  <dig> to  <dig> at the second qtl;

 lγγ is the dominant × dominant epistatic effect due to the interaction between the dominant effects at the first and second qtls.

genetic effect parameters for two interacting qtl are arrayed in a = t. we relate the genotypic value vector and genetic effect vector by

 u=da, 

where design matrix

 d=111111111111111111111-1-11-11-1-1-11-1-11111-11-1-11-11-1-1-11-11111-1-11-1-1-1-111-1-1111-1-111111-1-11-1-1-1-111-1-11-1-11-1-11-11-11111-1-1-11-1-111-1-111-1111-1-1-1-11-1-1111-111-11-11-1111-1-111-11-1-1-11-11-11-1-1-111-11-1-1111-11-1-11-11-1-111-11-111-11-1-1-1111-1-1-1111-11-1-11111-1-1-1-1-1-11111-1-111-1-1-11-11111-1-11-1-11-11-11-11-111-11-11-1-11-1-111111-1-1-1- <dig>  

thus, the genetic effect vector can be expressed, in terms of the genotypic value vector, as

  a=d-11u. 

if we have alleles  <dig> =  <dig> and  <dig> =  <dig> for an outbred family, equations  <dig> and  <dig> will be reduced to traditional biallelic additive-dominant and biallelic additive-dominant-epistatic genetic models, respectively  <cit> .

statistical model
likelihood
suppose there is a full-sib family of size n derived from two outbred lines. consider two interacting qtls for a quantitative trait. let u1v <dig> and u2v <dig> denote a general genotype at qtl  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, where u <dig> and u <dig>  are the alleles inherited from parent p <dig> and v <dig> and v <dig>  are the alleles inherited from parent p <dig>  the linear model of the trait value  for individual i affected by the two qtls is written as

  yi= ∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34ξiu1v1∕u2v2μu1v1∕u2v2+ei, 

where ξiu1v1∕u2v <dig> is the indicator variable for qtl genotypes defined as  <dig> if a particular genotype u1v1/u2v <dig> is considered for individual i and  <dig> otherwise, and ei is the residual error normally distributed with mean  <dig> and variance σ <dig>  the probability with which individual i carries qtl genotype u1v1/u2v <dig> can be inferred from its marker genotype, with this conditional probability expressed as ωu1v1∕u2v2|i <cit> .

the log-likelihood of the putative qtls given the trait value  and marker information  is given by

  l= ∏i=1n∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34ωu1v1∕u2v2|ifu1v1∕u2v <dig>  

where Θ is the vector for unknown parameters that include the qtl position expressed by the conditional probabilities ωu1v1∕u2v2|i, qtl genotypic values μu1v1∕u2v <dig> and the residual variance . the first parameters, denoted by Θp, are contained in the mixture proportions of the above model, whereas the second two, denoted by Θq, are quantitative genetic parameters. normal distribution density fu1v1∕u2v <dig> has mean μu1v1∕u2v <dig> and variance σ <dig> 

em algorithm
the standard em algorithm is developed to obtain the estimates of the unknown vector. by differentiating the log-likelihood of equation  with respect to two groups of unknown parameters , we have

 ∂∂Θlogl= ∑i=1n∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34fu1v1∕u2v2∂∂Θpωu1v1∕u2v2|i+ωu1v1∕u2v2|i∂∂Θqfu1v1u2v2∑u′1=12∑v′1=34∑u′2=12∑v′2=34ωu′1v′1∕u′2v′2|ifu′1v′1∕u′2v′2= ∑i=1n∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34ωu1v1∕u2v2|ifu1v1∕u2v21ωu1v1∕u2v2|i∂∂Θpωuv|i∑u′1=12∑v′1=34∑u′2=12∑v′2=34ωu′1v′1∕u′2v′2|ifu′1v′1∕u′2v′2+ωu1v1∕u2v2|ifu1v1∕u2v2∂∂Θq logfu1v1∕u2v2∑u′1=12∑v′1=34∑u′2=12∑v′2=34ωu′1v′1∕u′2v′2|ifu′1v′1∕u′2v′2= ∑i=1n∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34∏u1v1∕u2v2|i1ωu1v1∕u2v2|i∂∂Θpωu1v1∕u2v2|i+∂∂Θq logfu1v1∕u2v <dig>  

where we define

  ∏u1v1∕u2v2|i=ωu1v1∕u2v2|ifu1v1∕u2v2∑u′1=12∑v′1=34∑u′2=12∑v′2=34ωu′1v′1∕u′2v′2|ifu′1v′1∕u′2v′ <dig> 

which could be thought of as a posterior probability that individual i has a qtl genotype u1v1/u2v <dig> 

in the e step, calculate the posterior probabilities of qtl genotypes given the marker genotype of individual i by equation . in the m step, estimate the maximum likelihood estimates  of the unknown parameters by solving ∂∂Θlogl= <dig> . the closed forms for estimating the genotypic values and residual variance are derived as

  μ^u1v1∕u2v2=∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34∏u1v1∕u2v2|iyi∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34∏u1v1∕u2v2|iσ^2=1n∑i=1n∑u1=12∑v1=34∑u2=12∑v2=34yiμ^u1v1∕u2v <dig> ∏u1v1∕u2v2|i⋅ 

by giving initial values for the parameters, the e and m steps are iterated until the estimates are stable. the stable values are the mles of the unknown parameters. note that the qtl position within a marker interval can be estimated by treating the position is fixed. using a grid search, we can obtain the mle of the qtl position from the peak of the profile of the log-likelihood ratio test statistics across a chromosome.

hypothesis tests
after the parameters are estimated, a number of hypothesis tests can be made. the existence of a qtl can be tested by formulating the null hypothesis expressed as

  h0:μu1v1∕u2v2≡μ,foru <dig> v1= <dig> andu <dig> v2= <dig> h1:atleastoneoftheequalitiesabovedoesnothold. 

the likelihoods under the reduced  and full model  are calculated and their log-likelihood ratio  is then estimated by

  lr=-2inl0l <dig>  

where the tildes and hats are the mles under the h <dig> and h <dig>  respectively. the critical threshold for declaring the existence of a qtl can be empirically determined from permutation tests  <cit> .

hypothesis tests for different genetic effects including the additive , dominant  and additive × additive , additive × dominant , dominant × additive  and dominant × dominant  epistatic effects can be formulated, with the respective null hypotheses:

under each null hypothesis, the genotypic values should be constrained by

RESULTS
a worked example
we use a real example of a forest tree to illustrate our multiallelic epistiatic qtl mapping method in an outbred population. the material was an interspecific f <dig> hybrid population between populus deltoides  and p. euramericana . a total of  <dig> individuals were selected for qtl mapping. a genetic linkage map was constructed by using  <dig> ssr markers of segregating genotypes  <dig> ×  <dig>  which covers  <dig>  cm of the whole genome and contains  <dig> linkage groups. the total number of roots per cutting  was measured and showed large variation in the hybrid population during the later development stage of adventitious rooting in water culture.

through a systematic search over these linkage groups, the multiallelic espistatic model identifies six significant pairs of qtls from different groups for tnr at the 5% significance level . the group × group-wide lr threshold for asserting that a pair of interacting qtls exist was determined from  <dig> permutation tests. linkage group  <dig> has multiple regions that contain qtls, which are located between markers l2_g_ <dig> and l2_o_ <dig>  markers l2_p_ <dig> and l2_p_ <dig>  markers l2_p_ <dig> and l2_g_ <dig>  and markers l2_o_ <dig> and l2_o_ <dig>  these qtls form five epistatic combinations by interacting with each other or with those on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the sixth pair comes from linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>

two qtls are set at  <dig> cm and  <dig> cm in a chromosome of 100cm with  <dig> markers evenly spaced and the true parameters are set as in the second column.

it was found that the qtl positions can well be estimated using our model . the additive effects at individual qtls and additive × additive epistatic effects can be reasonably estimated even when a modest sample size is used for a modest heritability. the other genetic effect parameters, especially dominant × dominant epistatic effects, need a large sample size to be reasonably estimated especially when the heritability is low. because of a large number of parameters involved, the outcrossing design requires much larger sample sizes than backcross or f <dig> designs.

discussion
the past two decades have seen a tremendous interest in developing statistical models for qtl mapping of complex traits inspired by lander and botestin's  pioneered interval mapping  <cit> . however, model development for qtl mapping in outbred populations, a group of species of great environmental and economical importance  <cit> , has not received adequate attention. only a few publications are available to qtl mapping in outcrossing species  <cit> . in this article, we present a quantitative genetic model for studying the epistasis of multiallelic qtls and a computational algorithm for estimating and testing epistatic interactions.

the central issue of qtl mapping for outcrossing populations is how to model genetic actions and interactions between multiple alleles at different qtls. traditional quantitative genetic models have been developed for biallelic genetic effects  <cit>  and their extension to multiallelic cases have not been clearly explored. this study gives a first attempt to characterize epistatic interactions between multiallelic qtls that pervade outcrossing populations. we partition additive effects at each qtl into two subcomponents based on different parental origins of alleles. similarly, we partition the additive × additive epistasis into four different subcomponents, the additive × dominant epistasis into two subcomponents, and the dominant × additive epistasis into two subcomponents based on the interactions of alleles of different parental origins. these subcomponents have unique biological meanings because they are derived from distinct parents. in practice, hybridization is made between two genetically distant parents, thus an understanding of each of these subcomponent helps to study the genetic basis of heterosis.

we tested the new multiallelic epistasis model through simulation studies. in general, because of a number of parameters involved, a larger sample size is required to obtain reasonably precise estimation for qtl mapping in outcrossing populations. according to our experience, the increased heritability of traits by precise phenotyping can improve parameter estimation and model power than augmented experiment scales. we recommend that more efforts are given to field management that can improve the quality of phenotype measurements than experimental size. by analyzing a real data set from a poplar genetic study, the new model has been well validated. it is interesting to find that interactions between alleles from different poplar species contribute substantially to rooting capacity from cuttings, larger than genetic effects of alleles that operate alone. this result may help to understand the role of dominance in mediating heterosis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a statistical model for mapping interactive qtls in a full-sib family of outcrossing species. by capitalizing on traditional quantitative genetic theory, we define epistatic components due to interactions between two outcrossing multiallelic qtls. an algorithmic procedure was derived to estimate all types of outcrossing epistasis and test their significance in controlling a quantitative trait. our model provides a useful tool for studying the genetic architecture of complex traits for outcrossing species, such as forest trees, and fill a gap that occurs in genetic mapping of this group of important but underrepresented species.
