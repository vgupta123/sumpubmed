BACKGROUND
the beijing genotype of mycobacterium tuberculosis is a virulent strain that originated out of east asia  <cit>  and has disseminated around the world  <cit> . it is a member of principle genetic group  <dig>  <cit> , bearing the markers katg 463leu and gyra 95thr, and is characterized by a spoligotype  <dig>  isolates of the beijing strain have been associated with decreased survival times in mice  <cit>  and in the rabbit meningitis model  <cit> , and increased growth rates in human macrophages  <cit> . some patients infected with beijing genotype show increased radiographic cavitation  <cit>  and experience more treatment failures, independent of differences in drug resistance  <cit> . one potential explanation for the increased virulence is the production of phenolglycolipid , a surface antigen that suppresses the th <dig> response  <cit> . pgl is produced in beijing strains, but is not produced by members of the other principle genetic groups , such as m. tuberculosis h37rv, because the polyketide synthase pks15/ <dig> has a frameshift mutation splitting it into two separate open reading frames   <cit> .

the beijing genotype is strongly associated with drug resistance  <cit> , including multi-drug resistance  and extensive-drug resistance . one of the first outbreaks of mdr-tb, which occurred in new york city in the early 1990's, was found to be a clonal expansion of a variant of the w-beijing strain  <cit> . the beijing strain was also associated with an outbreak in azerbaijan prisons, where nearly all tb infections were beijing, and >50% were mdr  <cit> . the beijing genotype has been reported to account for 34% of the xdr cases across south africa  <cit> . similar findings of increased association of drug resistance with strains of the beijing genotype have been reported in india  <cit> , russia  <cit> , korea  <cit> , vietnam  <cit> , japan  <cit> , and germany  <cit> . in a large-scale study that included both civilians and prison inmates in russia, 67% of the tb infections were beijing, but the frequency of resistance to drugs like isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol was nearly twice as high among beijing as non-beijing isolates  <cit> . although these studies were performed in different populations using varying methodologies, taken together, they support the general view that infections with the beijing strain are more likely to be drug resistant than other strains of tb.

currently, the beijing strain constitutes a significant component of a major outbreak of tb in the western cape of south africa, where it represents  <dig> % of the drug-resistant cases . the proportion of the beijing genotype among drug-resistant cases is inflated relative to the overall proportion of beijing strains among drug-susceptible tb cases in the region, which was estimated at  <dig> % in cape town   <cit> . in another study of tb cases in the western cape region between  <dig> and  <dig>  28% of drug-resistant cases were of the beijing genotype, whereas 17% of cases overall were beijing  <cit> . epidemiological studies suggest that the beijing genotype is highly transmissible , leading to a hypothesis that drug resistance is spreading clonally through the region. however, the clonal expansion hypothesis contrasts with most tb outbreaks, which are often found to be constituted of a mixture of genotypes  <cit> . in fact, drug resistant mutations often incur a relative fitness cost, making it more difficult for them to compete  <cit> . van der spuy et al.  <cit>  found that the increase in beijing strains in cape town was primarily due to drug-susceptible strains. over a 12-year period, the number of drug-susceptible beijing isolates increased exponentially with a doubling time of ~ <dig> years, whereas the frequency of most other genotypes, including drug-resistant beijing isolates, remained relatively constant. this observation was taken to suggest that the success of the beijing strain is due overall to increased virulence rather than transmissibility  <cit> , and that drug-resistant strains of beijing were less fit that drug-susceptible beijing strains. thus the association of beijing with drug-resistance could be a side-effect due to the increased overall success of this strain.

the beijing genotype family can be divided into seven lineages, progressing from "ancestral"  to "modern" . these distinctions are based on comparison of is <dig> insertion sites, regions of deletion, and other markers  <cit> . sublineage  <dig> is most prevalent in the western cape , which, discounting founder effects, is interpreted to mean that it has higher fitness  <cit> . some studies have suggested that different lineages have different propensities to develop drug resistance. for example, mokrousov et al.  <cit>  found that ancestral lineages in china had a higher frequency of resistance to rifampicin and pyrazinamide. however, these findings were contradicted by a larger study of beijing isolates in south africa that found no statistically significant difference in drug resistance among the seven lineages  <cit> .

one particular sub-group of the beijing family has recently been identified, cluster r <dig> , that is overrepresented among drug-resistant isolates in the western cape of south africa  <cit> . r <dig> is a member of sublineage  <dig>  representing a modern beijing variant. r <dig> constituted over 75% of isolates of the beijing clade in 2005- <dig> in the western cape, and accounted for 42% of the increase in drug-resistant cases since  <dig>  <cit> . r <dig> was also found to be prevalent among children infected with drug-resistant tb in the region  <cit> . cluster r <dig> strains share the same c-15t inha promoter mutation responsible for resistance to isoniazid and many isolates  also have the ser531leu  rpob conferring rifampicin resistance, suggesting that it has evolved into a distinct mdr clone. if it were a distinct clone, this might imply that it has acquired compensatory mutations that enable it to tolerate the fitness cost associated with drug resistance mutations or enhance its transmissibility in the population.

although r <dig> is a well-defined cluster in terms of spoligotyping and is <dig> rflp fingerprinting, these are still coarse-grained methods of genotyping and do not guarantee that the drug-resistant isolates in this cluster are clonally derived. in order to get a more fine-grained picture of the r <dig> cluster, we performed whole-genome sequencing on eight drug-resistant isolates of r <dig> from various locations in the western cape of south africa. for comparison, we also sequenced hn <dig>  a drug-susceptible isolate from the us, and six drug-resistant isolates of the r <dig> cluster, which is part of the more ancestral sublineage  <dig>  using these whole-genome sequences, we reconstruct a phylogenetic tree and map drug-resistance mutations on them to examine the hypothesis of clonality.

methods
selection of strains for sequencing
m. tuberculosis hn <dig> was obtained from the nih tb vaccine testing and research materials laboratory at colorado state university. fourteen additional drug-resistant strains of the beijing genotype were selected for whole-genome sequencing and comparative analysis. the isolates were sampled from a database maintained at the dst/nrf centre, stellenbosch university, representing drug resistant tb cases from a variety of hospitals in the western cape, south africa . the samples were all selected to be isoniazid-resistant, and were chosen to span a range of degrees of drug resistance, including cases that are mono-resistant , mdr , pre-xdr , and xdr. no other biases  were applied in the sampling. all  <dig> isolates have the beijing spoligotype,  <dig>  six of the isolates investigated in this study are from sublineage  <dig>  representing the atypical beijing genotype . is6110-rflp analyses have classified these strains as being members of cluster r <dig>  the remaining  <dig> isolates are from cluster r <dig> in sublineage  <dig>  which represents "typical" beijing genotype strains . the is <dig> rflp patterns used for determining cluster membership of these isolates are shown in figure  <dig> 

inh = isoniazid rif = rifampicin str = streptomycin emb = ethambutol eth = ethionamide ami = amikacin kan = kanamycin cap = capreomycin ofl = ofloxacin

drug-susceptibility testing
drug susceptibility testing for isoniazid , rifampin , ethambutol , ethionamide , amikacin  and ofloxacin  was performed using the indirect proportion method on middlebrook's medium  <cit> . additional drug susceptibility testing was done using the proportion method on middelbrook's 7h <dig> medium containing ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin at the critical concentration of  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml,  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml, respectively.

dna preparation and sequencing reaction
sequencing of the genomes of  <dig> beijing strains of m. tuberculosis was carried out on an illumina genome analyzer ii . in this study, illumina paired-end sequencing method  was used. the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide -lysozyme method was used for extraction and purification of genomic dna  <cit> . suitable genomic dna samples for the gaii were prepared as described on the sample preparation protocol . 2- <dig> μg of genomic dna was used for sample preparation. genomic dna was sheared by a nebulizer to generate dna fragments for the illumina paried-end sequencing method. the specific oligonucleotides  designed for pe sequencing were ligated to both ends of dna fragments with the ta cloning method. adapter-ligated dna fragments of length 350- <dig> bp were isolated from a 2% agarose gel  by using qiaquick gel extraction kit . then the fragments were amplified by pcr reaction to generate the dna library . the median size of the library was estimated by examining the 2% agarose gel image. the molarity of the dna library was estimated as described in the sample preparation protocol . the dna libraries , including the ϕx <dig> control , were loaded on the flow cell for the cluster generation and sequencing.  <dig> cycles of images were collected, representing two 36-bp reads  plus  <dig> bases representing id tags for multiplexing. the images were analyzed using version  <dig>  of the gapipeline software supplied by illumina, producing files with 10- <dig> million pairs of  <dig> bp reads for each genome.

sequence determination and bioinformatics
the reads were analyzed by comparative genome assembly to determine the complete sequence of each genome using custom software developed in our lab. the reads were first mapped  against the genome of h37rv as a reference sequence. the mapping of each read was accomplished by ungapped alignment to the reference genome , allowing at most two mismatches out of  <dig> nucleotides. initially, the reads that were pair-mates were mapped independently; subsequently, locations of reads for which the paired-end did not match within  <dig> bp were discarded. the mapped reads were used to assemble a list of the nucleotides observed at each position within the reference genome contributed by all the reads that overlapped it. base calls were made by a maximum likelihood calculation, computed as the product of the probabilities for each base at each position using uncertainties estimated during image analysis. sites where apparent differences were observed were subjected to local contig-building, in order to determine whether the difference was due to a nucleotide substitution or a small insertion or deletion.

for each genome, a list of verified differences was prepared and used to modify the reference genome to produce an intermediate  genome. then the process was repeated by re-mapping the reads against the edited genome, and re-calling nucleotides at each position. for any sites that still had zero coverage, the base from the reference strain was used. this primarily included regions with exceptionally high gc-content .

large-scale deletions were identified by analyzing paired-end data for reads whose paired-end maps an unusually long distance away . large-scale insertions were determined by building contigs that spanned fragments, neither of whose paired ends mapped into the h37rv genome. these ~ <dig> bp fragments were then assembled into larger contigs using newbler , localized in the genome using paired-end information, and identified by performing blast searches on the ncbi website.

virtual spoligotyping was performed by aligning  all the reads obtained for each strain against each of the  <dig> spacer sequences  from the direct repeats  regions  <cit> . the number of matching reads for each spacer was counted, considering both forward and reverse-complement sequences, and accepting up to  <dig> nucleotide mismatch. spacers with  <dig> matches were interpreted as missing.

whole-genome alignments of the beijing sequences to other mycobacterial strains were generated using mummer version  <dig>   <cit>  to identify maximal stretches of perfectly matching regions, selecting optimal order-preserving assignments of matches between the genomes based on the longest increasing subsequence algorithm  <cit> , and then using in-house sequence-alignment tools to determine alignments of the intervening regions with mismatches and/or gaps.

the complete genome sequences for m. tuberculosis strains hn <dig>  r <dig> , and x <dig>  have been deposited in genbank with accession numbers adnf <dig>  adnh <dig>  and adng <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
whole-genome sequencing
in order to establish a complete genome sequence to use as a reference for sequencing of other members of the beijing strain family, hn <dig> was chosen as a representative strain and the genome was sequenced using solexa sequencing technology. hn <dig> is a fully drug-susceptible member of the modern  w-beijing family which was isolated in houston, tx as part of a tb outbreak in the 1990's, and has been used as a reference strain in multiple studies to characterize virulence and other properties of the beijing strain  <cit> . hn <dig> was sequenced in paired-end mode using  <dig> bp reads. mapping of reads to unique spacer sequences in the direct-repeats  region confirms that hn <dig> has the characteristic  <dig> spoligotype associated with the beijing strain family. the genome sequence of m. tuberculosis h37rv  was used as a reference sequence for comparative assembly of the hn <dig> genome. the mean depth of coverage was  <dig> x, and  <dig> % of the genome was covered by at least one read. the remaining uncovered regions are primarily associated with the family of pgrs genes, and are likely due to inefficient sequencing of gc-rich regions. in hn <dig>   <dig> % of sites with zero coverage  were located in pgrs genes.

among  <dig> snps relative to h37rv,  <dig> occur in protein-coding regions. only  <dig> of  <dig> genes contain a polymorphism of any type, and the remaining 73% of the genes in the genome are identical with the sequence in h37rv.  <dig> genes contain frameshift mutations . no mutations typically associated with drug resistance were found in the following genes, consistent with the pan-susceptible phenotype of this clinical isolate: inha, katg, etha, gyra, iniabc, kasa, ndh, rpob, rpsl, rrs, pnca, and embb. hn <dig> has the katg r643l and gyra s95t alleles, confirming its membership in principle genetic group  <dig>  <cit> . further details on snps and indels in hn <dig>  relative to h37rv, including is <dig> transpositions  are described in the additional file  <dig> 

then the genomes of the  <dig> beijing clinical isolates from south africa were sequenced in paired-end mode, using hn <dig> as a reference sequence . the coverage ranged between 29x and 98x, and the completion was  <dig> - <dig> %.

*the number of snps and indels are assessed relative to hn <dig> 

there was a high concordance of is <dig> insertion sites between r <dig> strains and hn <dig> . of the  <dig> insertion sites in hn <dig>  four are absent in r <dig>  although an additional four novel insertion sites are present in this cluster . similar to hn <dig>  r <dig> has a single insertion in the ntf region, grouping it with hn <dig> in the modern sublineage of beijing strains  <cit> . the r <dig> strains lack the rd <dig> deletion characteristic of sublineage  <dig>  <cit> , having rv1671-rv <dig> intact and placing them in sublineage  <dig>  the six r <dig> strains were all found to have the beijing spoligotype and a common set of  <dig> is <dig> insertion sites , including one insertion in the dnaa-dnan region. however, only  <dig> of these sites were shared with hn <dig>  the r <dig> strains do not have any insertion in the ntf region , classifying them as "ancestral" or "atypical" beijing lineages  <cit> .

the clinical isolates in the r <dig> cluster are fairly homogeneous at the genomic level. among  <dig> polymorphic sites between the r <dig> strains and h37rv ,  <dig> differences  were shared among hn <dig> and all  <dig> r <dig> strains. some of these differences from h37rv might be shared with other strain families like lam. there were  <dig> sites  where the r <dig> strains shared a difference from h37rv but hn <dig> did not, and there were  <dig> sites  where hn <dig> differed from h37rv but the r <dig> strains did not. each of the strains except one had a small number of unique snps .

r <dig> strains are found to have a set of snps compared to h37rv that only partially overlaps with the snps in hn <dig>  out of a selected set of  <dig> snps,  <dig>  were found to be common among hn <dig> and all six r <dig> strains relative to h37rv, hn <dig> has  <dig>  unique snps, and the r <dig> strains have  <dig>  shared snps not in hn <dig>  thus, while both hn <dig> and the r <dig> share many polymorphisms presumably acquired in a common ancestor of the beijing family, they have each diverged significantly, reflecting the difference in their lineages .

when snps at synonymous sites are categorized into specific base-pair substitutions, the majority of replacements  are found to be g:c to a:t transversions  . however, a similar bias is observed among synonymous snps in cdc <dig> or f <dig>  when compared to h37rv , suggesting that the effect is not due to a beijing-specific shift in the types of mutation.

drug-resistance mutations
among the beijing clinical isolates from south africa, well-known polymorphisms are observed that correlate with drug resistance patterns. drug-resistance polymorphisms for the  <dig> clinical isolates are shown in table  <dig>  all of the beijing isolates from the western cape, south africa included in this study are isoniazid-resistant, whereas hn <dig> is susceptible. all six r <dig> strains have the s315t mutation in katg, explaining the isoniazid resistance, and suggesting it was acquired prior to divergence of this cluster. x <dig> and x <dig> also have the c-15t inha promoter mutation, and r <dig>  x <dig>  and x <dig> have c-17t in the inha promoter. inha promoter mutations are generally considered to confer a lower-level of resistance to isoniazid  as well as high-level cross-resistance to ethionamide  <cit> . all  <dig> strains also have the mutation a381p in etha, a prodrug-activator, which has been suggested to also confer high-level resistance to ethionamide  <cit> . the polymorphisms in the r <dig> genome sequences are also largely consistent with the reported drug-susceptibility profiles, with the exception of ethionamide sensitivity in isolates x <dig>  x <dig>  and x <dig> . this may relate to anomalies in drug susceptibility testing, as all r <dig> isolates have the c-15t inha promoter mutation, which should cause ethionamide resistance  <cit> . in contrast to the cluster r <dig> isolates, the r <dig> isolates show no mutations in katg. strains r <dig> and x <dig> also have mutation ile194thr in the coding region of inha, which occurs in the active site of the enoyl-acp reductase and interferes with binding of inh-nad and eth-nad adducts  <cit> .

wt = wild-type, i = isoniazid, r = rifampicin, s = streptomycin, a = amikacin, c = capreomycin, k = kanamycin, e = ethionamide, b = ethambutol, o = ofloxacin.

wt = wild-type, i = isoniazid, r = rifampicin, s = streptomycin, a = amikacin, c = capreomycin, k = kanamycin, e = ethionamide, b = ethambutol, o = ofloxacin.

rifampicin resistance is explained in three r <dig> strains  by the d435v mutation in rpob, while the other three r <dig> strains  have s450l . both mutations are known to confer resistance to rifampicin  <cit> . s450l  is the most frequently observed mutation in cultures selected on rifampicin in vitro, implying lowest fitness cost  <cit> . d435v  is much less common in vitro   <cit> , but is frequently observed clinically  <cit> . four of the five r <dig> isolates that are rifampicin-resistant  have a mutation in rpob . however, isolate x <dig>  does not have any mutations in rpob, and conversely, isolate r <dig>  has s450l in rpob, which in turn may reflect laboratory error. the h445y mutation is less frequent among clinical isolates, but also occurs in the rifampicin binding site in rna polymerase.

resistance to aminoglycosides can result from a variety of polymorphisms, generally related to the small subunit of the ribosome. mutations that confer resistance to streptomycin and similar compounds are usually found in the 500-bp or 900-bp region of rrs, the 16s rrna, or in rpsl, one of the ribosomal proteins  <cit> . all six r <dig> strains have the a514c mutation in rrs, conferring streptomycin resistance. x <dig> and x <dig> showed streptomycin resistance in drug-susceptibility testing; data on the other four strains was not available. kanamycin binds a different site on the ribosome and shows cross-resistance with amikacin and capreomycin  <cit> . the most common mutation associated with kanamycin resistance is a1401g in rrs  <cit> . all r <dig> strains except isolate r <dig> have the a1401g mutation in rrs. four of the six strains were kanamycin-resistant . the capreomycin sensitivity of isolate x <dig> is inconsistent with the kanamycin/amikacin resistance, and might be an anomaly in drug-susceptibility testing. in the r <dig> cluster, isolates x <dig> and x <dig> are resistant to kanamycin and amikacin, and both strains show the expected a1401g mutation in rrs, whereas x <dig>  does not. r <dig> has rrs c517t and x <dig> has k43r in ribosomal protein rpsl, each of which should confer streptomycin resistance, though this was not tested.

resistance to fluoroquinolones is typically caused by mutations in gyra  <cit> . isolates x <dig> and x <dig> were reported to be ofloxacin-resistant, and x <dig> and x <dig> were reported to be ofloxacin-sensitive . three different amino acid mutations were observed in gyra among these six strains: d94h in isolate r <dig>  d94n in x <dig>  and d94g in x <dig>  the snps in isolates x <dig> and x <dig> explain their ofloxacin resistance, and the fact that x <dig> and x <dig> have wild-type gyra sequences is consistent with their ofloxacin sensitivity. the ofloxacin resistance of isolates x <dig> and x <dig> can be explained by mutations in d <dig> in gyra. isolate x <dig>  which is sensitive to oflaxacin, has a wild-type gyra sequence.

all six r <dig> strains have the mutation m306i in embb, commonly associated with resistance to ethambutol  <cit> , although all six strains were reported to be sensitive to ethambutol by drug-susceptibility testing. it is well known that drug-susceptibility testing under-reports ethambutol resistance  <cit> . note that, while all  <dig> strains have a mutation from met to ile, they use different codons; 'ata'  and 'atc' . many of the r <dig> strains have a mutation in met <dig> in embb, either to val or ile, although most of the strains tested sensitive to ethambutol as well.

although resistance to pyrazinamide was not tested,  <dig> of the  <dig> strains showed mutations in pnca . one r <dig> isolate  has a frameshift mutation of  <dig> bp in pnca, while another  had a large deletion of  <dig> bp knocking out the entire coding region, along with the adjacent gene, rv2044c. strain r <dig> has mutation d8n, and strain x <dig> has y103* . all six r <dig> strains show mutations in pnca: three strains have a frameshift mutation , and three have amino acid substitution . multiple mutations, including frameshifts, throughout pnca are associated with resistance to pyrazinamide  <cit> .

non-clonal acquisition of drug-resistance mutations
in order to better understand the origins of drug resistance among the beijing strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to identify their evolutionary relationships. subsequently, drug resistance mutations were mapped onto the tree to determine whether the patterns of drug resistance  could be explained by the same topology . a master set of  <dig> polymorphic sites  with good depth of coverage  across all sequenced strains was selected. a subset of  <dig> sites was produced by removing those involved in drug resistance . the  <dig> sites were used to construct a maximum parsimony tree using dnapars in phylip  <dig>   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic relationship with representative branch lengths, clearly showing the tight clustering of the two groups, cluster r <dig>  and the r <dig> cluster , indicating that both groups have evolved independently from a common ancestor.

the number of snps differentiating the strains within each cluster is small but non-zero. since the relationships are difficult to see in figure 4a, the phylogeny was re-drawn as a cladogram  in figure 4b, and each branch is labeled with the number of snps associated with it. the observation that cluster r <dig> isolates share  <dig> snps while the r <dig> isolates share  <dig> unique snps suggests that these two clusters are largely clonal, and that isolates within the clusters are differentiated from one another by a limited number of snps. for example, the similarity between x <dig> and r <dig> is supported by two unique snps: q219p in rv2571c and v16v in prow. the snps associated with each branch point are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  it is also interesting to note that some individual isolates have continued to diverge, for example isolate r <dig> has accumulated  <dig> unique polymorphisms. these differentiating snps likely represent recent evolutionary events. according to this phylogeny, hn <dig> is more closely related to the r <dig> cluster , but is distinguished from the r <dig> members by a further  <dig> unique differences . it is important to note that these polymorphisms do not necessarily imply anything about the overall population structure, due to the non-random nature of the sample. nonetheless, they represent the diversity and inter-relationships among the  <dig> clinical isolates sequenced.

when mutations related to drug resistance were projected onto this phylogeny, the patterns were frequently found to disagree with the phylogeny above. the most parsimonious explanation for this observation is that mutations conferring resistance to a given drug have arisen multiple times independently within both the r <dig> and r <dig> clusters. figure  <dig> shows the pattern of mutations in gyra conferring fluoroquinolone resistance. in these  <dig> beijing strains, mutations in asp <dig> appear to have arisen  <dig> times independently, each associated with a unique isolate . in fact, asp <dig> is mutated to  <dig> different amino acids , again supporting the uniqueness of these events.

mutations in rpob related to rifampicin resistance are shown in figure  <dig>  in the r <dig> cluster, the six isolates divide into two groups: three isolates with the s450l mutation, and three with the d435v mutation. similarly, the s450l mutation also explains the rifampicin resistance in a group of five isolates of the r <dig> cluster, clearly demonstrating that each cluster has acquired rifampicin resistance independently. it is important to note that three of the eight r <dig> isolates did not bear the s450l mutation. although many r <dig> isolates have the s450l polymorphism  <cit> , as of  <dig> only 73% of r <dig> isolates were rif-resistant  <cit> , indicating that this polymorphism had not yet achieved fixation in the population, and thus the population structure has not yet been taken over by a distinct mdr clone. of the three r <dig> isolates without the s450l mutation, two had wild-type rpob sequences and were rif-susceptible, and the third had a distinct rif-resistance mutation: h445y.

with respect to isoniazid resistance, figure  <dig> shows that the c-15t inha promoter mutation arose independently in both the r <dig> and r <dig> clusters. whereas the c-15t mutation is found in all  <dig> strains of r <dig>  it is only found in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains in the r <dig> cluster. however, the g-17t promoter mutation occurs in three other strains in the r <dig> cluster. the c-15t and g-17t inha promoter mutations in the r <dig> cluster both occurred in the context of the katg s315t mutation, which occurs on an earlier branch and is found in all the strains of the r <dig> cluster. simultaneous mutations in katg and the inha promoter are frequently observed in clinical isolates  <cit> , although it is unexpected that the inha promoter mutations, which confer lower-level resistance to isoniazid, apparently occurred second. in contrast, the ile194thr mutation in inha in isolates x <dig> and r <dig> appears to have been acquired subsequent to the c-15t inha promoter mutation common to the r <dig> strains, probably conferring higher-level resistance.

when the mutations in rrs and rpsl are mapped onto the phylogeny of the beijing isolates , it is found that the r <dig> strains all shared mutation a516g in rrs, suggesting that streptomycin resistance arose in a common ancestor. the rrs a1401g mutation, responsible for kanamycin resistance, was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> cluster r <dig> isolates, but not in isolate r <dig>  therefore, it most likely has arisen twice within this cluster . in the r <dig> cluster, mutations  were less prevalent. isolate r <dig> has a unique c517t rrs mutation that presumably also causes streptomycin resistance, and x <dig> is the only strain that has the k43r mutation in rpsl.

finally, among the  <dig> beijing isolates , there appear to be six distinct mutations of met <dig> in embb .

discussion
our data suggests that extensive drug-resistance  among beijing strains in the western cape of south africa is evolving and spreading adaptively rather than by clonal expansion. the phylogenetic analysis suggests that mdr drug resistance is being transmitted clonally, as demonstrated by the observation that isolates in the r <dig> cluster share the same c-15t inha promoter mutation, and isolates in the r <dig> cluster share the same katg s315t mutation. similarly, many of the strains share the rpob s450l mutation . this is consistent with the view that mdr-tb in the western cape is spreading by transmission  <cit> . however, mutations in other drug-resistance-related genes are highly homoplaseous, showing that the xdr mutations are not clonally related, even within these tightly defined clusters. for example, among the eight r <dig> strains sequenced, fluoroquinolone resistance was acquired three times independently, ethambutol resistance was acquired four times independently, and resistance to aminoglycosides was acquired four times independently.

the repeated acquisition of drug resistance mutations in these strains suggests that xdr isolates are less fit and do not propagate or compete well among the circulating population of beijing variants. if there were one well-adapted xdr clone that had perhaps acquired compensatory mutations, then it would presumably result in identical drug-resistance mutations being transmitted through the population, which is not the case. this is consistent with the findings of van der spuy  <cit> , who found that, although beijing strains as a whole were more prevalent and hence presumably more fit than other tb genotypes, drug resistant strains were not the predominant contributor to the rise of beijing in the cape town region , probably due to increased fitness cost associated with drug-resistance mutations. thus, although the beijing strain as a whole appears to be more transmissible than other strains of tb, accounting for its success and world-wide dissemination, this does not appear to directly explain the spread of xdr drug-resistance among beijing strains, as isolates in the region display varying drug-resistance mutations and hence do not represent the transmission of an identical clone. diversity of resistance mutations among beijing strains has also been observed in japan  <cit>  and russia  <cit> , again indicating independent acquisition.

this pattern mimics what has been observed for the lcc strains , which are also prevalent in south africa  <cit> , although lcc strains are not of the beijing genotype, but instead are in principle genetic group  <dig>  cluster analysis of drug resistance mutations in lcc isolates showed that they could not all be explained by a single sequence of acquisition, suggesting they arose multiple times independently  <cit> . however, previous studies have examined phylogenetic relationships using only a limited set of markers, including the drug-resistance mutations themselves, whereas our study is the first to use a genome-wide catalog of snps to assess relationships among strains independent of the drug-resistance mutations.

the repeated development of xdr drug resistance among beijing strains of tuberculosis in the western cape region differs from other outbreaks of drug-resistant tb, such as in new york city in the 1990's  <cit> , as well as in kwazulu-natal, south africa more recently  <cit> . each outbreak occurred in a defined geographical setting and was demonstrated to be due to transmission of clones with identical drug-resistance markers. in contrast, our findings suggest that xdr drug resistance in the beijing strains in the western cape is not spreading clonally, but continues to be acquired independently in different strains. the drug-resistant tb outbreak in the western cape of south africa covers a wider geographical region . thus the strains we analyzed are more distantly related, although they share a common ancestor, which is in turn reflected by the number of snps differentiating the respective isolates. the wide distribution of these strains demonstrates how failure to contain an initial drug resistant strain leads to both spread and acquisition of additional resistance markers under the right conditions, thereby emphasizing the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of drug resistance.

there are a number of possible explanations for the increased association of drug resistance with the beijing strain  <cit> . one hypothesis is that the beijing strain is more adaptive, allowing it to acquire mutations more rapidly, which are then selected through the application of chemotherapy. it has been hypothesized that the apparent adaptiveness of the beijing strain could be due to mutations in dna repair genes mutt <dig> and mutt <dig> which might produce a hypermutator phenotype  <cit> . however, these mutations appear only in the most recent lineages, and are not found in the more ancestral lineages, including lineage  <dig>  of which cluster r <dig> is a member. so it could not explain the extensive homoplasy of drug resistance among all these isolates. furthermore, a comparison of the types of substitutions in the genomes of r <dig> isolates versus r <dig> isolates shows that the profiles are nearly identical , suggesting that there have not been functional changes to specific dna repair genes or mechanisms, which might have been reflected in a bias of the substitution patterns  <cit> . no evidence has yet been found for hypermutation among clinical isolates, and the in vitro rpob mutation rate  has been found to be in line with non-beijing strains  <cit> .

the primary limitation of our study is related to the selection of clinical isolates for sequencing. while all were of the beijing genotype, the strains chosen for sequencing were selected to span a range of drug resistance from mono-resistant  to xdr. while no sampling bias  was intentionally applied, and the samples were isolated from patients in a variety of hospitals throughout the western cape region, it could be the case that our conclusions are specific to the small number of strains sequenced, or their shared resistance to isoniazid, and might not generalize to the broader tb epidemic within the region, or to outbreaks of drug-resistance and/or the beijing strain of m. tuberculosis in other geographic locations around the world. furthermore, no drug-susceptible strains from the western cape were sequenced, making the evolutionary relationships to the broader population of strains endemic to the region speculative. finally, incidence of hiv is high the western cape region, and this could be an additional complicating factor that could influence the acquisition of drug resistance in these strains, as suggested in  <cit> , but our study did not control for hiv status of the patients.

CONCLUSIONS
whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of genetic differences among clinical isolates of the beijing genotype from the western cape of south africa suggests that, while mdr-tb is spreading by transmission in the region, additional drug resistance mutations are being acquired independently, and hence the spread of extensive drug resistance  appears to be non-clonal. the successful dissemination of these drug-resistant beijing genotypes in south africa should be a major concern for the national tuberculosis control program, as the current strategy is unable to curb the spread of these strains  <cit> . failure to contain  these strains has led to the evolution of xdr-tb through further acquisition of resistance markers.
