BACKGROUND
plants are constantly confronted by various pathogenic and environmental stresses that challenge their survival. to deal with stresses, plants have evolved a variety of biochemical and physiological mechanisms. stress-activated molecular pathways include multiple inter-linked regulatory networks such as protein kinase signaling cascades that can efficiently transduce input signals into suitable outputs  <cit> . the best characterized protein-kinase-based amplification cascades rely on the mitogen activated protein kinases , which are conserved components of signal transduction in all eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . the mapk cascades rapidly transduce stress signals into various appropriate intracellular responses  <cit> . the basic mapk cascades are composed of three classes of protein kinases: mapk kinase kinase , map kinase  and mapk . mapkkks are the first component of the cascades that activate mapkks by phosphorylating two amino acids in the s/t-xxxxx-s/t  motif of the mapkk activation loop, and then mapkks become dual-specificity kinases that activate the downstream mapk through double phosphorylation of the t-x-y motif in the activation loop   <cit> . the activated mapk leads to the phosphorylation of transcription factors and other signaling components that regulate the expression of downstream target genes  <cit> .

so far, different members in mapk cascades have been identified and characterized by functional genomics approach in a variety of plant species, including arabidopsis, tobacco, rice, alfalfa and poplar. arabidopsis thaliana genome contains  <dig> mapkkks,  <dig> mapkks and  <dig> mapks  <cit> , whereas the rice genome contains  <dig> mapkkks,  <dig> mapkks and  <dig> mapks  <cit> . compared with mapks and mapkks, mapkkks act at the top of mapk cascades with much greater numbers and show more complexity and sequence diversity. according to characteristic sequence motifs, mapkkks are divided into three groups in higher plants: the mekk-like subfamily, zik subfamily and raf-like subfamily. compared to zik subfamily and raf-like subfamily, mekk subfamily members have a less conserved protein structure  <cit> . the raf and zik subfamily proteins have a c-terminal kinase domain  and a long n-terminal regulatory domain  that might function in scaffolding to recruit mapkks and mapks  <cit> .

in plants, mapk cascades have been implicated in the signaling pathways related to various stresses, ethylene signaling, innate immunity and defense responses  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the cascade mekk1-mkk4/5-mpk3/6-wrky22/wrky <dig> plays an important role in plant innate immunity  <cit> . investigations in alfalfa  have indicated that omtk <dig>  a mapkkk, was activated by hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . two well-studied mapkkk are ctr <dig>  and edr <dig>  of a. thaliana, both belonging to the raf-like subfamily. the ctr <dig> multigene family encodes an essential negative regulator for ethylene-induced gene expression in arabidopsis  <cit> , while edr <dig> was shown to be a negative regulator in salicylic acid-inducible defense responses  <cit>  with edr <dig> mutants showing increased resistance to powdery mildew  <cit> . in addition, it was reported that atraf <dig> mutant exhibited an enhanced tolerance to salt in arabidopsis  <cit> . over-expression of os-mapkkk <dig> increased the tolerance to dehydration stress through ros scavenging in rice  <cit> . in contrast to several reports on mapkkks in arabidopsis and rice, research on mapkkks in grapevine is still very limited.

grapevine  is one of the most economically valuable and most widely grown fruit crops in the world. sequencing of the highly homozygous grapevine pn <dig> genome  <cit>  provides a great opportunity for analysis of the grapevine genome and gene family evolution. previously we have validated  <dig> grapevine mapk gene by gene isolation and expression  <cit> . to further understand how the mapk cascade operates in grapevine and their internal relationships, we surveyed the gene family of mapkkks, the top of the mapk cascade in the grapevine genome. fourty-five grapevine mapkkk genes were identified by a detailed bioinformatics analysis, annotated and named according to their sequence similarity with arabidopsis genes, as established by the grapevine scientific community  and their chromosomal position and gene structure were determined. in addition, we analyzed their transcript profiles in different organs and developmental stages using published microarray data. finally, we examined their expression patterns in response to different stresses using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction . these results indicate that the evolutionary expansion of mapkkks is associated with the diverse requirement in transducing external and internal signals into intracellular actions in mapkkk-mapkk-mapk cascade in grapevine.

RESULTS
identification of mapkkk family in grapevine and construction of a phylogenetic tree
availability of the complete grapevine genome sequence has made it possible for the first time to identify all the mapkkk family members in this plant species. with this aim, we performed hmmer searches using  <dig> arabidopsis mapkkk sequences as query and identified a total of  <dig> mapkkk genes from the grapevine genome. these genes were named according to the rules recently established by the grapevine scientific community . functional gene names were assigned according to their sequence similarity to arabidopsis genes, and following the nomenclature reported in the tair database . in all cases the locus id reported on the v <dig> grapevine genome browser  is also reported, to provide a unique identifier and avoid mistakes during future conversion from different sources. the phylogenetic tree described above was constructed with the phylogeny.fr web service  <cit> , to provide a repeatable phylogenetic tree. all genes received a functional name  followed by a number higher than the highest number used for arabidopsis. therefore, the progressive numbering of grapevine gene names procedes along the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig> from left to right. only when a one-to-one orthology was present in the arabidopsis mekk subfamily, the grapevine gene was given the corresponding arabidopsis-like name . in the other subfamilies, the raf or zik names were used as synonyms, derived from the arabidopsis orthologous . if two or more grapevine genes had the same phylogenetic distance from a single homologue in arabidopsis, they were differentiated by a number .table  <dig>

. the phylogenetic tree was created using mega <dig> program with the neighbor-joining  method using full length sequences of  <dig> grapevine and  <dig> arabidopsis mapkkk proteins. bootstrap values for  <dig> replicates are indicated at each branch. to identify the species of origin for each mapkkk, a species acronym is included before the protein name: atmekk, atraf, atzik for map3k from a. thaliana; vvimapkkks for mapkkk from v. vinifera.



when one or more genes in grapevine matched more than one gene in arabidopsis, a new name was attributed consisting of the common mapkkk term and an increasing numbering. the detailed information on the vvimapkkk genes identified in the present study is listed in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  including nomenclature, accession numbers, chromosomal localizations, gene length, number of amino acid in the protein, isoelectric point  and molecular weight . these genes were distributed over almost all chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig>  the gene length ranged from  <dig>  bp  to  <dig>  bp . the open reading frames  encoded polypeptides ranging from  <dig> aa  to  <dig> aa . the predicted molecular masses ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kd and isoelectric point value ranged  <dig> - <dig>  . according to the present study, the number of grapevine mapkkk genes is significantly smaller than those of arabidopsis mapkkks   <cit>  and rice mapkkks   <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of vvimapkkk genes
to investigate the evolutionary relationships between mapkkk members in grapevine and arabidopsis, and also to assign a name to grapevine mapkkk genes  a phylogenetic tree was constructed from alignments of the full coding sequences of all  <dig> mapkkk genes  with the procedure and parameters described in materials and methods . based on the phylogenetic tree, grapevine mapkkk were classified into the same corresponding categories in arabidopsis, which include mekk-like, raf and zik subfamilies. there were  <dig> vvimapkkks and  <dig> atmapkkks in the mekk subfamily, only  <dig> vvimapkkks and  <dig> atziks in zik subfamily, while  <dig> vvimapkkks and  <dig> atrafs grouped in the raf subfamily .

in the three clades, there were many grapevine mapkkks clustering together, suggesting that these homologous genes may have derived from multiple duplications after the speciation of grape during the evolution. moreover, many grapevine mapkkk genes have their clear orthologues in the arabidopsis genome, which suggests that these genes might be conserved for some specific functions in the two species. interestingly, one grapevine gene, vvimapkkk <dig>  stands outside the main branches and was included in the zik family with a bootstrap values of 71%, just above the threshold of 70% established for the phylogenetic analysis .

chromosomal location of vvimapkkk genes
based on the gene prediction of the grapevine genome, the physical locations of the mapkkk genes on grape chromosomes are depicted in figure  <dig>  fourty-five vvimapkkk genes mapped on all grapevine chromosomes except chromosome  <dig>  and one mapkkk  was situated on the undetermined chromosome . the vvimapkkk genes were unevenly distributed, with a number of genes per chromosome ranging from one to five . we identified  <dig> paralogs among the  <dig> grapevine mapkkks,  <dig> of which appeared to result from genome fusion events  <cit> , and the other  <dig> paralogs within the same chromosome  were likely generated through tandem duplications . gene duplication events resulted in gene family members’ amplification in the genome. although several paralogs such as vvimapkkk <dig> and vvimapkkk <dig>  vvimapkkk <dig> and vvimapkkk <dig> shared high similarity of amino acid sequences, they were far from each other on different chromosomes.figure  <dig>

gene structural analysis of vvimapkkk genes
exon/intron structure can provide additional evidence to support phylogenetic groupings  <cit>  as exon/intron structure divergence often plays a key role in the evolution of gene families  <cit> . moreover, the conservation of gene structure in paralogous genes is usually strong and sufficient to reveal evolutionary relationships  <cit> . the exon/intron structures of the vvimapkkk genes were investigated by using the prediction of the grapevine genome .figure  <dig> 
schematic diagrams for intron/exon structures of mapkkk genes in grapevine. the green boxes indicate the exons while the single lines indicate introns. utrs are displayed by thick blue lines at both ends.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represent different intron phases. gene models were drawn to scale as indicated at the bottom.



as shown in figure  <dig> and table s <dig> , the number of introns in vvimapkkk genes was highly variable, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> introns, whereas two genes  had only one intron. the large variation in structures of vvimapkkk genes suggests that the grapevine genome has changed significantly during its long evolutionary history. however, a certain degree of similarity could be observed among subgroups, supporting evolutionary relationships among members of each clade. the majority of genes in the zik subfamily contain 6– <dig> introns, genes in the mekk subfamily mostly ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> introns, the raf subfamily showed a variable exon number but with a majority of genes ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> introns, often with very long introns. within this frame, paralogous gene pairs generally shared highly similar exon-intron structures . collectively, the divergent gene structures between the different phylogenetic subgroups suggest that duplication events of mapkkk genes might have occurred in ancient times and that offspring genes evolved into diverse exon/intron structures, possibly to accomplish different functions in the grapevine genome.

analysis of conserved domains among vvimapkkks
the pattern of amino acid residues found in many subdomains is conserved among the family members  <cit> . all vvimapkkk genes grouped under mekk, zik and raf subfamilies were further analyzed for the presence of specific signatures. nine vvimapkkks and  <dig> atmapkkks which belong to mekk subfamily share the conserved signature motif g  px  mapev, as revealed by the amino acid sequence analysis of the protein kinase domain . presence of this signature in  <dig> out of  <dig> vvimapkkk further confirmed their grouping into the mekk subfamily, while vvimapkkk <dig> showed a substitution of the methionine residue with a threonine. the zik subfamily consists of  <dig> vvimapkkks and  <dig> atziks. the characteristic feature of this subfamily consists of a conserved signature gtpefmape  y across all grapevine members . no additional kinase domains were identified in the grapevine mekk or zik subfamilies, except for vvimapkkk <dig> . one exception is vvimapkkk <dig>  which clusters together with zik-encoding genes at the nucleotide level  with a bootstrap values just above the threshold of 70%, but the alignment of the corresponding predicted protein with other grapevine mapkkks at the aminoacid level revealed the presence of a slightly modified raf domain instead of the typical zik domain. for this reason it was simply named vvimapkkk <dig>  without any reference to subfamily.

the raf subfamily is the largest of the  <dig> clades of mapkkks. twenty-seven and  <dig> mapkkks were grouped in the raf subfamily in grapevine and arabidopsis, respectively. multiple alignments of the kinase domains revealed the presence of the raf specific signature gtxx  mape in almost all grapevine mapkkk proteins, with only slight variations in vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig> . moreover, the majority of proteins in the raf subfamily contained additional protein domains , the most frequent one being the edr <dig> domain  followed by the pb <dig> domain , and other additional domains with lower frequencies. interestingly, two “stress/fungal response” domains were detected in the sequence of vvimpkkk <dig>  which shows a relevant divergence from other members of both clades as already mentioned.

among the components of the kinase cascade in plants, only a few mapkkk genes have been characterized. it was shown that atmapkkk <dig> and atmapkkk <dig> played important roles in plant innate immunity  <cit> . mapkkk <dig> in arabidopsis was found to be responsible for oxidative stress and to be involved in negative regulation of hormone signaling  <cit> . it was reported that omtk <dig>  a mapkkk from m. sativa, regulates oxidative stress signaling  <cit> . recently, the arabidopsis atzik <dig> protein wnk <dig>  was demonstrated to phosphorylate the putative circadian clock component aprr <dig> in vitro and might be involved in the control of circadian rhythms by regulating its biological activity, suggesting a different function from that of other mapkkks  <cit> . two of the best-studied raf-like mapkkks in arabidopsis, ctr <dig>  and edr <dig> , act as negative regulators in ethylene-induced gene expression  <cit>  and in response to powdery mildew attack  <cit> , respectively. however, neither ctr <dig> nor edr <dig> have been confirmed to participate in a classic mapk cascade  <cit> . among those genes, only edr <dig> has a clear orthologue in grapevine  and can be an interesting candidate to ascertain its possible analogous functions in this species, while other characterized arabidopsis map3ks show different degrees of similarity with several grapevine genes.

expression profiles of vvimapkkk genes in different developmental stages and tissues
to determine the putative involvement of vvimapkkk genes in grapevine growth and development during the life cycle, we analyzed their transcript levels in  <dig> different grapevine tissues corresponding to various developmental stages  by performing a hierarchical clustering of a high-throughput microarray dataset from recent research  <cit> . all  <dig> vvimapkkk genes were represented by probes on the array. the heatmap in figure  <dig> represents the abundance of each transcript in each sample, normalized on the median expression value of that gene in all samples , and clustered according to the expression profile in different grapevine tissues and developmental stages. all vvimapkkk members were expressed in at least one developmental stage of grape organs and most of them did not show striking difference in expression between samples, suggesting these genes may have house-keeping roles in the organ development.figure  <dig> 
hierarchical clustering of the expression profiles of all  <dig> vvimapkkk genes in different grapevine developmental stages and tissues. a total of  <dig> grapevine samples  covering most organs at several developmental stages were analyzed. log2-transformed expression values were used to create the heat map. the red or green colors represent the higher or lower relative abundance of each transcript in each sample, compared to the median expression value of that gene in the whole sample set. genes and organs were clustered  according to their expression profiles. developmental stages are abbreviated according to fasoli et al.  <cit> .



the most peculiar expression of vvimapkkk was in pollen samples where most genes showed a up- or down-regulation, in comparison to other organs. the clustering of vvimapkkk s according to their expression profile  revealed that the expression of a group of genes was much higher in young tissues and organs than in ripening or senescing ones, suggesting that these vvimapkkk are mostly related to signal transduction during development in metabolically active tissues. the decreased transcript levels of vvimapkkk genes in cluster a were especially evident in post-withering stages, in which berries are left to natural dehydration for about 3 months. on the opposite, vvimapkkk transcripts in cluster b showed a higher level in later stages of grape development and during withering, suggesting that this set of genes may be responsive to dehydration and putatively involved in the deep transcriptomic and metabolic changes controlling biosynthesis of secondary metabolites responsible for the typical aromas of wines. this information can be important for further dissection of the signal transduction pathways operating in the transition from vegetative to reproductive stages  <cit>  and in the regulation of the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds in the berry, in which different groups of mapkkk may be involved.

it should be noted that the clustering of expression profiles does not reflect phylogenetic similarities. we only found similar expression profiles for the couples of mapkkks 22/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  56/ <dig>  and 42/ <dig>  in general, genes within the  <dig> clades of mekk, zik and raf or even paralogous genes may have very different expression profiles and possibly serve different functions in each organ and stage. this could have resulted from post-duplication diversifications, including subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or sub-neofunctionalization  <cit> . these results provide a basis for further investigations on the function of vvimapkkk genes in grapevine developmental biology.

expression profiles of vvimapkkk genes in response to biotic and abiotic stresses
only a limited number of genes in mapkkk family have been functionally characterized in arabidopsis  <cit>  and even less in other species  <cit> . among those characterized genes, some were shown to be involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in particular, two members of arabidopsis raf-like mapkkks with a function in plant defense were characterized: ctr <dig> , negatively regulating ethylene responses  <cit> , and edr <dig> , acting as a negative regulator of disease resistance and ethylene-induced senescence in arabidopsis  <cit> . gene expression patterns usually act as indicators of gene function. in the present study, we investigated the expression patterns of all vvimapkkk genes by semi-quantitative real-time rt-pcr in response to biotic  and abiotic  stress conditions, as well as in response to hormones  and h2o <dig> treatments. powdery mildew caused by the biotrophic ascomycete erysiphe necator schw. adversely affects vine growth, berry quality and grape production worldwide  <cit> . salicylic acid , ethylene  and hydrogen peroxide  play central roles in biotic stress signaling upon pathogen infection. sa and eth are signal molecules implicated in plant defense responses to pathogens  <cit> . h2o <dig> is an important ros and a critical signaling molecule in cascades leading to plant responses to pathogens and abiotic stress factors  <cit> . treated samples were collected in all cases at  <dig> time points, that is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 72 hours post-treatment , except for samples subjected to drought stress, which were collected after  <dig>   <dig> and 12 days .

expression data of individual genes under each treatment are reported in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and additional file  <dig>  expression changes less than two-fold were not considered significant under these stresses. a comprehensive view of the expression profiles for all genes and all treatments is provided in figure  <dig>  red or green colors represent the increase or decrease of transcript levels  between treated and control samples, while black boxes represent non-modulated genes. the heat-map graphic output allows a glance of differences and similarities for a comparison of the effects of different treatments on a given gene. on the whole it is apparent that expression profiles can be grouped in  <dig> main clusters: cluster a) is a small group of vvimapkkk genes with a prevalent trend of up regulation in most treatments, although with some notable exceptions following sa and drought treatment; the small cluster b) contains genes mostly down regulated by all treatments except drought stress, and c) a third cluster with a variable expression pattern in different treatments or time points, which have in common a strong up regulation of transcript levels in response to drought. thus, from this general overview in can be suggested that water deprivation induces a peculiar expression profile of all mapkkk genes, different from all other treatments considered.figure  <dig>

e. necator: powdery mildew infection; sa: treatments with salicylic acid; eth: treatments with ethylene, h2o2: treatments with hydrogen peroxide; drought: drought treatments. the heat-map reports the fold-change of relative expression for all vvimapkkk genes in response to the different treatments, in comparison to their respective controls. red and green colors represent increased or decreased expression levels, respectively, in comparison to controls, as reported by the scale. genes were clustered  according to similarities in expression profiles. details of the treatments are reported in materials and methods. relative expression values for each gene and each treatment are provided in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and additional file  <dig> 



only a few genes diverge from these  <dig> main groups: vvimapkkk <dig>  which is almost invariably repressed, and vvimapkkk <dig>  which is strongly induced by e. necator, by sa and by h2o <dig> at the same time points of  <dig> and 24 h post-treatment.

examining each stress condition separately, it can be observed that e. necator caused a strong increase of transcripts of most genes in cluster a  and additionally of vvimapkkk <dig> and 38; in particular, vvimapkkk <dig> showed the highest transcript abundance, between  <dig> and 27-fold the control . a few genes  are significantly down regulated by powdery mildew infection, especially vvimapkkk <dig>  while other genes are variably but slightly modulated. it can be observed however that many vvimapkkk transcripts showed a decreased abundance at the very early time point , a trend to a more or less pronounced increase afterwards, and a new decrease at the last collection time . this observation might correlate with the full establishment of infection and a possible down-regulation of defense responses, as it was reported in barley that powdery mildew can induce susceptibility in infected cells  <cit> . although elucidating the exact roles of these vvimapkkk genes in pathogen interactions requires further functional analysis, our findings provide the first gene-family-wide survey on the expression patterns of specific grapevine mapkkk in pathological conditions, and these highly up- and down-regulated genes can be candidate genes for future investigations.

salicylic acid and ethylene were chosen to investigate transcriptional responses of vvimapkkks to hormone treatments. regarding the response to sa, figures  <dig> and  <dig> shows a general picture of vvimapkkks down regulation for most genes at most time points, especially in cluster a, in which vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig> show a decreased transcript abundance of more than  <dig> fold at  <dig> hpt, but increased afterwards, especially at  <dig> hpt. clear increases could be detected for vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> hpt and for vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> hpt. response to ethylene was striking for some vvimapkkk genes . the same vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig>  responsive to sa at 12hpt, were also responsive to ethylene, especially at early time points, as well as vvimapkkk <dig> and the paralogous couple vvimapkkk 22/ <dig>  vvimapkkk <dig> is the grape orthologue of arabidopsis edr <dig> gene. edr <dig> exerts its negative control at a point of cross talk between ethylene and salicylic acid signaling  <cit> . therefore it seems interesting that treatments with both sa and eth may induce an increase of vvimapkkkk <dig> at early time points, possibly as a regulatory mechanism to keep a balance between the two pathways. sa and eth are involved in different signal transduction pathways and their action is often considered antagonistic, but may also cooperate in regulating defense responses  <cit> . other mapkkk genes were mostly down regulated by ethylene along the whole time course, such as vvimapkkk <dig> and  <dig> . in some cases we observed a very similar expression profile in response to these two treatments, such as for vvimapkkk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all down regulated and for vvimapkkk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with variable but similar profiles along the time course of the experiments.

to further investigate the roles of vvimapkkk genes, their expression levels were measured in response to the defense signaling compound h2o <dig>  several transcripts reacted strongly to this treatment along the whole experiment , especially vvimapkkk <dig>  which increased up to  <dig> fold at  <dig> hpt, and vvimapkkk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with relevant increases at several collection times. a slight increase, of about 3-fold  was also observed for vvimapkkk <dig>  which shows a high degree of sequence similarity with arabidopsis atmapkkk <dig> , involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species  homeostasis  <cit> . the level of this grapevine transcript was down regulated by e. necator infection and induced by ethylene. since plant genomes generally contain a relatively large number of mapkkk genes, this differential regulation of mapkkk gene expression may be a mechanism by which stress responses are fine tuned, although additional work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

to analyze the responsiveness of vvimapkkk to abiotic stress, drought treatments were performed. drought is a major environmental factor limiting productivity and distribution of plants  <cit> . when grapevine plants were subjected to drought stress, almost all vvimapkkk genes displayed significantly increased expression levels especially at 8 days post-treatment . among all performed treatments, drought is the one which caused the strongest effect, with many vvimapkkk transcripts increasing more than  <dig> fold, and  <dig> transcripts  showing a more than 20-fold increased expression . down regulation, although rare, was also very strong in the case vvimapkkk <dig>  . for several unregulated genes, the increase was sustained also in the last collection time of  <dig> dpt. the first collection time  did not reveal a significant modulation, suggesting that plants could maintain more or less stable mrna levels in the first days after watering suspension, except for vvimapkkk <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  strongly and early down regulated. therefore, in comparison to other stresses, drought determines a peculiar response of strong transcriptional activation on most vvimapkkks, especially at  <dig> d after drought treatments, suggesting that grapevine mapkkks are very likely playing roles in response to drought stress. the involvement of mapkkk in drought resistance was seldom investigated. among the few examples there are a raf-like mapkkk gene dsm <dig> with a function in drought and oxidative stresses signaling in rice  <cit>  and a tobacco mapkkk  which enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic maize  <cit> . our data provide the first insight into the possible involvement of grapevine mapkkks in this type of stress. however, more research is needed to determine the specific functions of the mapkkk family by additional biological experiments, particularly to investigate why such a high number of vvimapkkks genes are responsive to drought.

CONCLUSIONS
so far, mapkkks have only been investigated in some plant species including arabidopsis, rice and maize, while no systematic analysis has been conducted in grapevine. in the present study we identified  <dig> mapkkk coding genes in the v. vinifera genome, which were grouped into three subfamilies - mekk, zik and raf- and named according to their sequence similarity to arabidopsis genes. the exon/intron structure, phylogeny and conserved domains strongly supported their identity as members of each subfamily. furthermore, by exploring a previously published microarray analysis, we provided information about the expression profiles of all vvimapkkk genes across different tissues and developmental stages. finally, we experimentally determined the expression profiles of all grapevine mapkkk genes in response to biotic and abiotic stress conditions, as well as hormone and h2o <dig> treatments. in conclusion, our work provides an inventory of vvimapkkk genes potentially involved in environmental stresses, an initial insight into this important gene family and a number of possibly stress-related candidates for future functional analysis. this information provides a framework to unravel the biological roles of the vvimapkkk genes family in grape and their regulatory mechanism, particularly their apparently wide implication in drought responses.
