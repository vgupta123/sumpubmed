BACKGROUND
comparative mapping represents a major approach in providing new insights into dynamics of genome evolution. since the pioneer studies that showed linkage conservation among genomes  <cit> , genome comparisons have been carried out in about  <dig> mammalian species  <cit> . although fluorescent in situ hybridization  and painting analyses have contributed significantly to the identification of conserved syntenies among species  <cit> , the number of ordered gene maps is still too small to draw fully meaningful inferences on chromosomal evolution. in cattle and goats, we had previously reported  <cit>  a high level of intra-chromosomal rearrangements and the existence of preferential breakpoints over the whole genome, which have been confirmed by radiation hybrid  mapping data  <cit> . recently, two high-resolution human-bovine comparative maps have been reported, based on data from the human sequence and bovine rh panels  <cit> . these studies have improved the genome-wide comparative coverage by ~20% between man and cattle and identified  <dig> and  <dig> segments with conserved gene order, respectively. the availability of whole genome sequences for man, mouse and rat and in draft format for eight other mammalian species has made it possible to evaluate the rates of chromosomal evolution and to detect segmental duplication in most of the primate-specific breakpoint regions  <cit> . in addition, everts-van der wind et al  <cit>  have analyzed the evolution of centromere and telomere positions and the gene content within evolutionary breakpoint regions in cattle versus man.

here, we have explored the relationships between chromosomal rearrangements and the density of interspersed repeats, since these represent a prevalent feature of mammalian genomes. indeed, all mammalian genomes present essentially the same four classes of transposable elements : autonomous long interspersed nucleotide elements , line-dependent rna-derived short interspersed nucleotide elements , retrovirus-like elements with long terminal repeats  and dna transposons . the age and history of these repeats have been inferred from phylogenic analyses , suggesting that most mammalian tes are related and thus can be divided into lineage-specific repeats  and ancestral repeats . moreover, tes can undergo broad bursts of amplification in a lineage specific way, potentially leading to speciation as suggested in primates  <cit> .

in order to carry out this study, first we have produced an updated version of the bovine physical map constructed in our laboratory  <cit> , and have used it to extend and refine the bovine comparative map with man and mouse. this has led to a high resolution comparative map integrated with the most recent bovine genetic map  <cit>  and fish data  <cit> . second, based on this comparative map, we have identified and examined the intervals between segments of conserved gene order  among the cattle, human and mouse genomes. we have found that these breakpoint regions are enriched in lineage specific repeats: alu repeats in man and sines in mouse. since previous studies have suggested that tes could be involved in chromosomal rearrangements, we propose that the increased density of tes and especially sines in evolutionary breakpoint regions has a role in mammalian chromosome evolution and we discuss the recent findings of murphy et al  <cit>  on the implication of segmental duplication.

RESULTS
updated bovine physical map
our first autosomal bovine physical map reported in  <dig>  <cit>  comprised  <dig> contigs of which  <dig> were anchored to the cattle genome. in the present work, we have anchored  <dig> additional contigs by pcr-screening of  <dig> new well-distributed microsatellites. moreover, we have produced  <dig>  bac end sequences  from  <dig>  inra bac clones in collaboration with the genoscope and collected  <dig>  bes from the chori- <dig> library via genbank. blast analyses of these bes produced  <dig>  valid hits, of which  <dig>  correspond to known or predicted human genes and  <dig>  are located outside genes. blast statistics are similar in all cases, i.e. 88% mean identity percentage,  <dig>  10- <dig> mean e-value and  <dig> bp mean homology size. as a result,  <dig>  inra and  <dig>  chori- <dig> bovine clones have been anchored to the human sequence.

to date, the updated version of our physical map comprises  <dig>  contigs ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb in size . among these,  <dig> are anchored to the bovine genome by  <dig>  markers,  <dig>  to the human sequence and  <dig> to the genome of both species. these  <dig> contigs comprise  <dig> bovine markers and  <dig>  hits on the human genome. data are available through the cattle webfpc  <cit>  or the bovmap database  <cit> .

an integrated high-resolution comparative autosomal map for cattle
to construct this comparative autosomal map, first we used the  <dig> contigs anchored to both the bovine and human genomes. then, we added  <dig> fish localizations . since contigs contain several bes, they are anchored to human genome with  <dig> positive blasts. although the btau  <dig>  whole genome assembly was released in the course of this work, it was not used to draw meaningful conclusions for the following reasons:  blasting large marker sets, which had not been used to build btau  <dig>  assembly, showed that it contained partial and sometimes erroneous data  and  since the btau  <dig>  scaffolds were built based mainly on syntenic relations with the human genome, there may be a bias towards a reduced number of rearrangements between these two species. thus, the current bovine assembly should be exploited with care and we only used it to anchor  <dig> additional microsatellites to the human sequence.

as a result, our comparative map comprises  <dig> loci anchored to both the bovine and human genomes .

according to the bovine genetic map, our physical map covers 90% of the bovine autosomes and only bta <dig> has a coverage below 80%. bovine orthologous regions have been identified for about 91% of the human autosomes, leaving  <dig> human segments  without comparative mapping information.

our results reveal  <dig> conserved synteny segments between bovine and human autosomes, in good agreement with previous studies  <cit> . if gene order is taken into account, we identify  <dig> segments, of which  <dig> include at least two markers. thus, our work has extended or refined  <dig> known segments with conserved gene order and identified  <dig> new segments. only nine previously reported segments based on single fish localizations have not been confirmed or remain inaccurate in the present study .

analysis of evolutionary breakpoints
evolutionary breakpoint regions between two species are defined as the interval between two segments of conserved gene order. they are classified into four types, based on their likely origin . repeat densities have been computed for each class of repeats and type of breakpoints and compared to the densities along the human or mouse chromosomes. repeat densities were not computed along the bovine genome because of flaws in the bovine genome sequence. indeed, bovine scaffolds are in general smaller than the corresponding bac contig lengths and contain many large gaps. scaffolds contain only one third to one half of the sequence of the corresponding genomic region. this is consistent with assembly statistics describing that ~34% of the bovine genome are covered by anchored scaffolds. moreover, typical errors in draft genome sequences include misassemblies of repeated sequences, collapses of repeated regions, making such sequences difficult to use for repeat content analysis.

the one-sample kolmogorov-smirnov test, based on the repeat density, showed an increased density of several interspersed sequences in certain regions. p-values are given in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> .

we have detected a highly significant increased density of sine alu repeats in the human sequences corresponding to hsa and mmu breakpoints but not to the bta breakpoints . a principal components analysis  suggests that most of the hsa breakpoints are enriched in various repeats: three hsa breakpoints contain only a high density of ancient alu repeats, four only a high density of young alu repeats and four display an elevated frequency in l <dig> repeats .

the same analysis performed on mmu breakpoints shows a strong correlation between all repeat densities . analysis of the mouse sequences reveals an increased density of some rodent specific sines b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and id in mmu breakpoints, whereas the bta and hsa breakpoints do not show any difference with the whole mouse genome. moreover,  <dig> mmu breakpoints are enriched only in erv-l  or erv-k rmer17c. five of these mmu breakpoints also delineate breakpoint regions in rat, suggesting that they occurred in the mus lineage.

human sequences of  <dig> bta breakpoints display an alu repeat content typical of hsa breakpoints, with an increase mainly in the oldest alu repeats . likewise, a repeat content typical from mmu breakpoints is also observed in the orthologous mouse sequences.

moreover, a search for centromeric or telomeric satellites in the human sequence has shown that  <dig> breakpoint regions contain at least two satellite repeats. about 71% of these breakpoints involve two different chromosomes and may thus be considered as interchromosomal breakpoint regions, whereas 29% may be intrachromosomal breakpoint regions . although not statistically significant, satellites may be slightly over-represented in interchromosomal breakpoints. about 11% and 4% of interchromosomal and intrachromosomal breakpoint regions contain satellite repeats, respectively.

discussion
discrepancies between different bovine comparative maps
the autosomal comparative map reported here is in good agreement with previous studies based either on fish or rh mapping of genes. most discrepancies are due to differences between framework maps, especially in that reported in  <dig> by everts-van der wind et al, which was built with a low resolution rh <dig> panel and a reduced number of backbone microsatellites. erroneous identification of orthologous sequences may also introduce some errors in all studies and contribute to the observed discrepancies. moreover nine cattle fish localizations have been found to be inconsistent, probably due to false orthologous gene pairs or mapping errors.

breakpoint regions display a high density of lineage specific repeats
we have shown an association between the density of interspersed repeats and the evolutionary breakpoints in the human and mouse genomes. interestingly, the repeat increase in these regions concerns only repeats having spread after the divergence of these species. moreover, for a given species, only breakpoint regions having occurred within this species are enriched in repeats and more surprisingly, in species specific repeats, except for mmu breakpoints that appear to be alu rich in the human sequence. this latter result agrees with the strong correlation observed between the local sine density in mouse and the alu density in orthologous loci in man  <cit> . common biological factors governing the insertion and/or retention of repeats in particular regions or the phylogeny of sine repeats  could explain these correlations.

conversely, human sequences spanning regions of bta breakpoints do not reveal any enrichment in alu repeats, which suggests that they may be associated with repeats having different insertional characteristics. bovine lineage specific sines or lines bov-ta, bov-a <dig> or bov-b could be good candidates for such repeats and this hypothesis should be assessed after completion of the bovine whole genome sequence.

moreover,  <dig> bta breakpoints show a typical hsa and mmu repeat content in the corresponding human and mouse sequences. if we assume that rodents diverged from a primate-artiodactyl clade, about 50% of the human rearrangements should have also occurred independently in mice, suggesting a very high frequency of convergent evolution. if one rejects this hypothesis, then artiodactyls may be more distant from human than are rodents. thus, this analysis of the repeat content in evolutionary breakpoint regions supports the recent hypothesis that artiodactyls diverged from a primate-rodent clade  <cit> .

since evolutionary breakpoints appear to be enriched in specific interspersed repeats, widespread activity of tes could be involved in genome evolution. indeed, they provide material for dna mispairing and thus can lead to genomic instability and rearrangements. a key role of tes in intrachromosomal rearrangements  has been evidenced in drosophila  <cit> , mosquito  <cit> , man  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . likewise, in human tumors, the high density of repetitive dna in a given region provides hot spots for homologous recombination and mediates translocation processes  <cit> .

moreover, alu mispairing could have generated many segmental duplications  <cit>  that are found in most primate-specific breakpoint regions, suggesting their role in chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> .

however, it is possible that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently but in the same region where modifications are better tolerated. high repeat densities could also be a consequence of breakpoints as suggested by dobigny et al  <cit>  i.e. major regulation pathway of repatterned genomes could be transiently inefficient, thus resulting in conditions suitable for te amplification.

an overall model of genome evolution
genomes may evolve cyclically under the influence of three main factors: transposon normal activity, bursts of transposon activity and dynamics of centromeres and telomeres.

 normal transposon activity may be responsible for most small intrachromosomal rearrangements .

 bursts of transposon activity result in a dramatic increase of the local repeat density and thus, may induce large intrachromosomal rearrangements directly or indirectly by segmental duplications. for example, alu repeats and rodent sines could have given rise to most of the intrachromosomal rearrangements during a middle term period ), while during a more recent period , ervs could have caused at least  <dig> rearrangements in the ancestor of the muridae and five in the mouse.

 chromosome fusions or fissions may have produced most interchromosomal rearrangements, as suggested by the proportion of interchromosomal breakpoints containing centromeric and telomeric satellites  and by early cytogenetic analyses  <cit> . likewise, a recent study has revealed a clustering of centromere and telomere sequences at the site of evolutionary breakages  <cit> . telomeres may have mediated or enhanced these rearrangements, as demonstrated for subtelomeres  <cit> . it has been shown that centromeres can be repositioned or created de novo and thus they could be involved in stabilizing interchromosomal rearrangements.

this model agrees both with the random breakage and the 'fragile breakage' models proposed by nadeau  <cit>  and pevzner  <cit> , respectively. on the one hand, rearrangements may occur in repeat-rich regions that are roughly randomly distributed along the genome, even if sines are preferentially located in gc-rich regions whereas lines are essentially present in at-rich regions. on the other hand, the high density of repeats could promote both hot spots of chromosomal evolution  <cit>  and segmental duplications, in accordance with the fragile breakpoint model. moreover, the mammalian genome tolerates insertion and accumulation of repeats only in a limited number of regions as indicated by the clustering of some repeats in orthologous regions from different species. repeat families may have sequentially gathered in the same regions, potentially leading to successive rearrangements. such regions may thus appear as 'fragile' and could explain that nearly 20% of the breakpoints are reused during mammalian evolution  <cit> . in addition, some regions could be involved in evolutionary breakpoints in one species and could lead to disease in another, as suggested by the close relationship between evolutionary breakpoints and neoplasia-associated human chromosome sites  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we report a high-resolution integrated bovine comparative map with man and mouse based on microsatellites, inra bovine contigs, bac end sequencing and previous fish data. this comparative physical map should be useful for the assembly of the bovine whole genome sequence.

moreover, it has allowed us to analyze the dna content in breakpoint regions to reveal specific repeat density patterns. thus, 'junk dna' may have played a significant role in chromosome evolution and genome plasticity. periodic phases of intrachromosomal rearrangements , followed by interchromosomal rearrangements  could be the driving force of genome evolution. interestingly, amplification of tes has been described as a response to stress factors either of environmental origin or genomic nature . in our model, te mediated chromosome evolution, leading to new gene regulations and expressions, could thus represent an inventive mechanism to speed up fitness to new environmental conditions, leading to speciation.

however, more studies are required to ascertain whether increased te density is the cause or the consequence of chromosome rearrangements. moreover, we cannot rule out that repeats and breakpoints accumulate independently in the few same regions where modifications are better tolerated. nevertheless, high density repeat clusters combined with a well-documented repeat phylogeny should highlight probable breakpoints, and permit their precise dating. new statistical models of evolution should be developed, taking into account not only the parsimony principle but also the present information in order to help reconstruct ancestral karyotypes.
