BACKGROUND
inflammation in the central nervous system is characterized by increased activation of microglia and astrocytes, elevated production of cytokines and other pro-inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide  and prostaglandins, enhanced blood–brain-barrier permeability and hence increased leukocyte invasion. neuroinflammation is an acutely protective mechanism, however, long-lasting and persistent formation and accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators can initiate neuronal damage, neuronal circuit impairments and neurodegeneration. correspondingly prolonged activation of neuroinflammation is thought to play a destructive role in many neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

parkinson’s disease  is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, which affects approximately 1 % of the population over 65 years of age. postmortem studies have shown an increase in neuroinflammatory signals in the brains of pd patients. activated microglia and astrogliosis have been found in the affected substantia nigra of pd patients  <cit> . moreover, a higher density of cd8+ and cd4+ t-cells was shown in pd brains than in healthy control brains  <cit> . correspondingly, the neuroinflammatory pathology found in brains of pd patients has been reproduced in several pd animal models  <cit> .

most of the glial cells in the brain are astrocytes, which are present in all regions of the brain and are localized in strategic positions in close proximity to neurons. astrocytes are important contributors to the inflammatory responses during brain injury and infection. similar to microglia, astrocytes can express and secrete a variety of molecules that modulate inflammation, for example toll-like receptors , proinflammatory cytokines and no. tlrs are receptors that are expressed in cells of the innate immune system. they recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and certain endogenous molecular patterns. the induction of inflammatory responses by the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide  is mediated by tlr <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, tlr <dig> has been shown to be upregulated in microglia in synucleinopathy brains  <cit> .

the pathological hallmarks of pd are intraneuronal protein inclusions called lewy bodies or lewy neurites. these inclusions mainly consist of the protein α-synuclein   <cit> . in addition, although astrocytes express only very low levels of αsyn themselves  <cit> , αsyn-containing inclusions have been found in astrocytes in postmortem brains from patients with lewy body diseases . moreover, point mutations and genomic multiplications of the gene encoding αsyn  are linked to autosomal-dominant pd .

αsyn contains  <dig> amino acids and can associate with lipids . the non-amyloid component domain  of αsyn is essential for its pathogenic oligomerization and fibril formation  <cit> . αsyn is highly abundant in the brain, but is also present in other tissues, for example in red blood cells  <cit> . it is mainly localized in pre-synaptic terminals  <cit> , and a small portion of the protein is also secreted to the extracellular space  <cit> . cell stress like proteasomal dysfunction or oxidative stress may increase the secretion of αsyn  <cit> . extracellularly applied αsyn is able to induce inflammatory responses in neurons and glial cells  <cit> . primary astrocytes treated with media from αsyn overexpressing sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells show increased expression of cytokines, among others the interleukins il- <dig> and il-1β, as well as cyclooxygenase- <dig>   <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms by which αsyn induces neuroinflammatory responses are not entirely resolved. tlr <dig> was reported to mediate αsyn induction of tumor necrosis factor-α  and il- <dig> in both microglia and astroglia  <cit> . on the other hand, tlr <dig> was reported to mediate microglial activation  in response to cell-secreted αsyn  <cit> , and β1-integrin signaling mediated the morphological and motility responses  <cit> . moreover, pre-conditioning microglia with αsyn alters tlr responses  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the role of tlr <dig> in the activation of inflammatory responses in astrocytes in the presence of extracellular αsyn. primary astrocyte-rich cultures from tlr <dig> knockout mice and littermate controls were treated with purified recombinant human αsyn produced in bacteria. moreover the internalization of extracellular αsyn into primary astrocytes was investigated. our results indicate that αsyn is able to activate tlr <dig> signal transduction and thereby induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducible no synthase  and cox- <dig>  to mediate nuclear translocation of nuclear factor κb  and to activate c-jun n-terminal kinase  and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  modules. in contrast, the uptake of extracellular αsyn into astrocytes appears to be mediated by tlr4-independent pathway.

RESULTS
treatment with recombinant αsyn induces tlr4-dependent gene expression in primary astrocyte cultures
to investigate if tlr <dig> plays a role in inflammatory reactions to exogenous αsyn, primary littermate tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− astrocytes were treated with recombinant αsyn, and lps as a positive control. the expression of nos <dig>  il- <dig>  il1b, cox- <dig>  tnfa and ngf mrna was investigated by semi-quantitative pcr. lps dramatically induced the expression of nos <dig>  il- <dig>  il1b, and cox- <dig> in tlr4+/+ astrocytes . tnfa expression was also enhanced by lps treatment while ngf expression was less consistently altered. though significantly reduced , some induction by lps could be detected also in tlr4−/− astrocytes. this might reflect the ability of lps to activate additional receptors, such as tlr <dig>  <cit> . treatment with  <dig>  µm αsyn induced the expression of nos <dig>  il- <dig>  il1b, and cox- <dig> in tlr4+/+ but no significant induction was detected in tlr4−/− astrocytes . tnfa expression was elevated by αsyn in tlr4+/+ astrocytes, but remained at basal levels in tlr4−/− astrocytes.fig.  <dig> mrna induction of pro-inflammatory mediators by extracellular αsyn is reduced in tlr4

time course experiments confirmed the inductions within few hours of nos <dig> and cox- <dig> as well as il- <dig> and il1b, which were abolished in tlr4−/− astrocytes . tnfa was similarly induced by αsyn while again only basal expression remained in tlr4−/− astrocytes. washout of agonists showed the reversible nature of astrocyte stimulations . we also measured no release from stimulated astrocytes . similar to lps, αsyn treatment clearly induced no release, although overall the variance of this assay was high. nevertheless, administration of viper peptide that inhibits tlr <dig> largely abolished no release, in contrast to the control peptide . in conclusion, the mrna induction of pro-inflammatory mediators by extracellularly applied αsyn involves tlr <dig> fig.  <dig> time course and recovery of pro-inflammatory mediator expression. a primary astrocyte-rich cultures from littermate tlr4

decreased p <dig> and jnk phosphorylation in tlr4−/− astrocytes after αsyn treatment
since mrna inductions of inflammatory mediators by extracellular αsyn appeared to depend on the presence of tlr <dig> we wondered if other pathways that are activated by tlr <dig> were also affected. therefore we treated primary astrocytes from littermate tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− mice with lps as positive control or recombinant human αsyn for 1 h. the cells were recovered in growth media for 0–24 h  and immunoblotting was performed using antibodies against phosphorylated  p <dig> mapk and jnk. in tlr4+/+ cells treatment with αsyn led to phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk whereas in tlr4−/− less induction of the phosphorylation was seen. in another experiment the astrocytes were continuously treated with lps and αsyn for 0–24 h . also in this experiment we could detect increased phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk after 2–6 h in tlr4+/+ astrocytes. again the induction of p <dig> mapk and jnk phosphorylation tended to be reduced in tlr4−/− astrocytes. in conclusion, treatment of astrocyte-rich primary cell cultures with recombinant αsyn induced phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk, involving tlr <dig> 

extracellularly applied αsyn does not cause to nuclear translocation of nf-κb in tlr4−/− astrocytes
activation of tlr <dig> leads to phosphorylation and degradation of iκb and thus allows the transcription factor complex nf-κb to translocate to the nucleus. primary tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− astrocytes were treated with different concentrations of the positive control lps or recombinant human αsyn for 6 h. the cells were immunostained for p <dig>  a component of the class ii nf-κb protein complex, and p <dig> positive nuclei were quantified. as expected, lps treated cells showed an increased number of p <dig> positive nuclei in both tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− cells, however to a lesser extent in the knock out astrocytes . the recombinant αsyn induced nf-κb translocation in tlr4+/+ cells in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in tlr4−/− astrocytes very few p <dig> positive nuclei were detected. thus indicating that extracellular αsyn can induce the nuclear translocation of nf-κb in a tlr4-dependent manner.fig.  <dig> αsyn treatment induces tlr <dig> dependent nuclear translocation of nf-κb in primary astrocytes. a primary astrocyte-rich cultures from littermate tlr4

primary astrocytes internalize αsyn from the medium in a tlr4-independent manner
different studies have indicated that a variety of cell types, for example neuronal cells, microglia and astrocytes, are able to internalize extracellular αsyn  <cit> . the mechanism of the uptake of the monomeric form has been suggested to differ from the uptake of oligomeric and fibrillar αsyn  <cit> . we investigated if primary tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− astrocytes cultures were able to internalize the recombinant αsyn. indeed, after 48 h of continuous incubation an immunoblot signal for human αsyn could be detected in samples that had been treated with  <dig>  or  <dig>  µm wild-type αsynwt, mutant αsyna30p or phosphorylation-deficient αsyns129a . no considerable difference in the internalization of different αsyn variants or between the genotypes of astrocytes could be detected. pathological αsyn is extensively phosphorylated at s <dig> and at this site phosphorylated αsyn is found in lewy bodies  <cit> . to see if the internalized αsyn is phosphorylated in the astrocytes we treated primary astrocyte cultures with recombinant αsyn for 48 h. no signal could be detected with a phospho-s <dig> αsyn specific antibody . as a positive control for the antibody we used brain lysate from an aged snca transgenic mouse, which harbors excessive amounts of s <dig> phosphorylated αsyn  <cit> . also the αsyns129a mutant was internalized , suggesting that phosphorylation at s <dig> is not a predominant factor in astrocytic uptake of αsyn.fig.  <dig> extracellular αsyn is internalized by astrocytes in a tlr <dig> independent manner. primary astrocytes from littermate tlr4

−/− mice  or tlr4
+/+ mice  were continuously treated for 48 h with indicated concentrations of recombinant human synucleins or lps or left untreated . cells were washed twice with pbs prior to lysis. the protein lysates were immunoblotted and probed with human-specific anti-αsyn  and also antibody against αsyn phosphorylated at s <dig> . gapdh serves as control for equal protein loading throughout. positive control in  is brain lysate from a 18 month old thy1hsnca transgenic mouse, which has high amounts of phosphorylated αsyn. n is indicated in the figure  or n =  <dig> . c primary wild type astrocytes were treated continuously with  <dig>  µm αsyn for indicated times. protein lysates were examined by immunoblotting as above



next we made a time course experiment where primary astrocyte cultures were treated continuously for 0–48 h with recombinant human αsyn. already after 1 h the astrocytes had internalized detectable amounts of the recombinant αsyn. interestingly, the intensity of the signal from internalized αsyn diminished with time . thus, astrocytes seem to be able to purge extracellular αsyn.

discussion
the molecular mechanisms that trigger degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in pd are still under investigation. it is currently heavily debated if αsyn can act as an agent that spreads neurodegeneration in pd brains and thus cause the progression of the disease. the role of the portion of αsyn that is secreted from neurons is largely unknown. previous studies have shown that treatment with recombinant αsyn produced in bacteria as well as cell culture medium from cells that overexpress αsyn induces neuroinflammatory responses in microglia and astroglia . in agreement with this we could see an induction of cytokines, cox- <dig> and nos <dig> mrna, phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk, and nuclear translocation of nf-κb in primary astrocyte rich cultures that had been treated with recombinant human αsyn purified from bacteria. previous studies have suggested that tlr <dig> may be involved in synucleinopathies. upregulation of tlr <dig> has been detected in multiple system atrophy, both in the brains of patients with the disease and in brains from a transgenic mouse model of the disease  <cit> . specifically, fellner et al.  <cit>  recently showed that αsyn preparations greatly enhanced rapid secretion of tnf-α and c-x-c motif chemokine ligand  <dig>  and a more delayed secretion of il- <dig> in tlr4+/+ astrocytes, which was strongly suppressed in tlr4−/− astrocytes. our present study confirms these findings at the mrna level for the delayed il- <dig> response, and adds il1b to the list of tlr4-dependent αsyn responses. moreover, we identify nos <dig> and cox- <dig> as potential signaling targets, and show the activation of mapk and nf-κb pathways by which tlr <dig> appears to mediate pro-inflammatory responses to extracellular αsyn in astrocytes.

astrocytes are in close proximity to neurons and neuronal synapses. these cells have been shown to be important scavengers of different potentially neurotoxic molecules that are secreted from neurons like glutamate, potassium and calcium. in accordance with this, we could detect a fast astrocytic internalization of the applied extracellular αsyn followed by degradation. these findings are supported by a previous study where cell secreted αsyn was readily endocytosed by primary rat astrocytes  <cit> . this implicates that astrocytes are decreasing the amount of potentially proinflammatory extracellular αsyn. the exact mechanism of the uptake of αsyn is still being investigated. in addition, the mechanism of uptake of monomeric and protofibrillar αsyn has been suggested to differ  <cit> . monomeric αsyn has been suggested to be able to passively diffuse through the plasma membrane  <cit> . thus αsyn would be localized in the cytosol and be directly available for proteasomes. however, also lipid-raft mediated endocytosis has been suggested for the uptake of monomeric αsyn  <cit> . the reproducible tlr4-independent αsyn uptake route in astroglial cells observed here and by fellner et al.  <cit>  remains to be further characterized. it is presently unknown if other receptor mediate αsyn endocytosis in astrocytes, or if it is a receptor-independent form of pinocytosis, or a non-classical internalization or membrane penetration mechanism.

the formation and biological activities of oligomeric and fibrillar αsyn species are a vast topic in the field. specifically, pre-formed fibrils are suggested to propagate cell-to-cell spread of αsyn  <cit> , and specific types of αsyn oligomers were reported to activate tlr <dig> on microglia  <cit> . on the other hand, “soluble” αsyn was a powerful stimulator of tlr <dig> both on microglia and astrocytes  <cit> . cell type and receptor specificities, experimental conditions or conceptual issues could account for such differences. the present study did not focus on the nature of αsyn species involved in tlr <dig> responses and uptake in astrocytes. no procedures were undertaken to pre-aggregate our αsyn preparations, but we cannot rule out the presence of some αsyn oligomeric or aggregated species. moreover, it is hard to predict what happens on the membrane surface, and if αsyn oligomers assemble near or on tlr <dig>  or if αsyn oligomerizes during or after uptake. more work is necessary to unravel the different roles of the various αsyn assemblies in the brain.

the αsyn level has been measured to be  <dig>  or  <dig>  nm in the interstitial fluid of control or transgenic snca mice, respectively  <cit> . the inflammatory responses were seen when we used  <dig>  µm of αsyn, which is a more than  <dig>  times higher concentration. however, it is possible that the local concentration within synapses, which are touched by astrocytic endfeet, can be at least temporarily increased. it would be very interesting to be capable of measuring the αsyn concentration within synapses and to investigate the effect of physiologically relevant extracellular αsyn concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
extracellular αsyn can induce inflammatory responses in astrocytes in a tlr4-dependent manner and this may worsen the stress conditions in synucleinopathy brains. on the other hand, astrocytes may also play a protective role in the disease progression by efficiently sequestering and degrading the proinflammatory extracellular αsyn.
