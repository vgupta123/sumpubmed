BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae  is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. primarily a commensal, invasive pneumococcal disease  is characterized by spread of the pneumococcus from the nasopharynx to normally sterile sites such as the lungs, blood, and central nervous system. at risk for ipd are young children, the elderly, and individuals who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions such as sickle cell anemia. worldwide, it is estimated that s. pneumoniae is responsible for  <dig> cases of ipd per  <dig>  persons per year and over a million deaths annually  <cit> . of note, the preponderance of invasive disease is the result of infection with a relatively few invasive clones  <cit> , a finding that suggests invasive clones carry genes that facilitate disease progression that are absent in non-invasive isolates.

in  <dig>  the primary nucleotide sequence of three s. pneumoniae genomes became publicly available  <cit> . in  <dig>  comparative genomic hybridization analysis of  <dig> clinical isolates using microarrays determined that  <dig> large loci, hence forth termed regions of diversity , accounted for half the genomic variation observed among all pneumococci   <cit> . genomic comparisons, performed by either microarrays or direct sequencing suggested that these  <dig> rds are regions of genome plasticity and are unequally distributed among clones and serotype  <cit> . these findings were confirmed by bruckner et al., who using dna from  <dig> s. pneumoniae isolates and microarrays, identified  <dig> clusters of  <dig> kb and larger that were not shared by a variety of genetically different s. pneumoniae strains  <cit> . of the  <dig> rds,  <dig> have been associated with atypical gc content and  <dig> have been determined to be flanked by remnants of mobile genetic elements  <cit> ; findings that indicate these rds were most likely acquired by horizontal transfer.

to date,  <dig> rds have been conclusively demonstrated by deletion mutagenesis to contain genes that contribute to virulence. rd <dig> encodes zmpc, a zinc metalloproteinase that plays a role in pathogenicity of the lung  <cit> . rd <dig> encodes the capsular polysaccharide synthesis operon; capsule is an absolute requirement for virulence  <cit> . rd <dig> encodes the pathogenicity islet rlra  <cit> ; rlra isresponsible for the formation of pilus-like structures on the surface of the bacteria. mutants deficient in rlra are attenuated in their ability to adhere to cell lines in vitro, colonize the nasopharynx and progress to pneumonia and bacteremia in mice  <cit> . rd <dig> encodes pneumococcal pathogenicity island  <dig>   <cit> . virulence genes within ppi <dig> include, piaabcd, an iron acquisition locus, phgabc, an operon required for growth in hyperosmotic medium such as blood and serum, and sp <dig>  a gene with unknown function  <cit> . finally, rd <dig> encodes the pathogenicity island psrp-secy2a <dig>  <cit> . psrp-secy2a <dig> encodes the serine-rich repeat adhesin psrp. disruption of psrp resulted in a mutant unable to establish lower respiratory tract infection and delayed in its ability to enter the bloodstream. table  <dig> describes the  <dig> rds identified in s. pneumoniae. a list of all the genes within these rds and their function based on sequence homology has been previously described  <cit> .

†as described by tettelin et al.  <cit> .

in this investigation we examined the remaining uncharacterized rds  to determine if they contribute to virulence. using allelic exchange we created isogenic deletion mutants deficient in these rds  and determined their ability to colonize the nasopharynx and cause invasive disease in mice. we concluded that genes within rd <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contributed to s. pneumoniae virulence and that none of the rds examined were required for nasopharyngeal colonization. finally, rd <dig> is composed of two pathogenicity islands. these have previously been designated rd8a and rd8b   <cit> . we show that genes within the third operon of rd8b, rd8b <dig>  encoded the genes responsible for rd <dig> virulence.

RESULTS
challenge of mice with s. pneumoniae mutants deficient in rd
to determine if genes within rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were required for virulence, cohorts of at least  <dig> balb/cj mice were infected intranasally with  <dig> cfu of tigr <dig> and tigr <dig> rd deficient mutants . mice were monitored for  <dig> days after challenge and bacterial titers in the blood determined on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  two days post-challenge bacterial titers in the blood were significantly reduced in mice challenged with t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  t <dig> Ωrd <dig> and t <dig> Ωrd <dig> . in contrast, mice challenged with t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  and t <dig> Ωrd <dig> had bacterial titers in the blood equivalent to wild type. mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd <dig> and t <dig> Ωrd <dig> also had significantly lower bacterial titers on day  <dig> , after which an insufficient number of wild type infected mice remained alive for comparison . of note, significantly lower bacterial titers in the blood at day  <dig> corresponded with improved survival over time versus infected controls; a finding that indicates genes within rd <dig>  rd <dig> and rd <dig> contributed towards virulence.

nasopharyngeal colonization
the attenuated phenotype observed with t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  t <dig> Ωrd <dig> and t <dig> Ωrd <dig> may be the result of an inability of the mutants to colonize the nasopharynx. to test the contribution of all the rds to nasopharyngeal colonization, we infected mice intranasally with a sublethal dose of s. pneumoniae  and examined the ability of the mutants to persist in the nasopharynx for up to  <dig> weeks. no differences were observed in the number of bacteria present in nasopharyngeal lavage elute obtained from mice challenged with the rd mutants and wild type  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after challenge . thus genes within rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> did not contribute to nasopharyngeal colonization.

challenge of mice with s. pneumoniae mutants deficient in rd <dig> operons
rd <dig> is greater than  <dig>  nucleotides in length and encodes  <dig> genes divided into  <dig> operons . previously, using comparative genomic analyses, we determined that rd <dig> is composed of two pathogenicity islands, rd8a and rd8b, that are adjacent to each other on the tigr <dig> chromosome  <cit> . to determine which of these pathogenicity islands were required for virulence we created two mutants, one deficient in rd8a, which lacked the genes sp <dig> to sp <dig>  and one deficient in rd8b which lacked the genes sp <dig> to sp <dig>  and tested the ability of these mutants to cause disease. two days post-challenge mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b had bacterial titers in the blood significantly lower than mice infected with tigr <dig>  whereas mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8a had bacterial titers in the blood comparable to wild type . as with t <dig> Ωrd <dig>  lower bacterial titers of t <dig> Ωrd8b in the blood corresponded with improved survival . all mice infected with rd8a died within  <dig> days of challenge , whereas 91%  of those infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b survived past day  <dig> 

to determine the operon within rd8b that were responsible for virulence, we created isogenic mutants deficient in the operons rd8b <dig>  rd8b <dig> and rd8b <dig> and challenged mice with these mutants. deletion of rd8b <dig> or rd8b <dig> failed to have a statistically significant impact on virulence. mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> and t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> had bacterial titers in the blood equivalent to wild type at day  <dig> and a survival rate comparable to wild type infected mice . in contrast, deletion of rd8b <dig> attenuated tigr <dig> virulence. mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> had 40-fold less bacteria in the blood than mice infected with tigr <dig> , and demonstrated improved survival over time . thus genes within rd8b <dig> were in large part responsible for the virulence associated with rd <dig> 

unlike deletion of rd8b1- <dig> , it is of note that deletion of rd8b <dig> did not completely attenuate tigr <dig> virulence. moreover, the mutant t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> was not fully virulent. at day  <dig> mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> had a median bacterial titer in the blood 10-fold lower than wild type , likewise, mice infected with t <dig> Ωrd8b <dig> demonstrated a delay in time of death , albeit these differences were not significant. thus it seems that genes within rd8b <dig> might also contribute to virulence, but not in a manner sufficient to demonstrate statistical significance in this challenge model.

tigr <dig> growth in media with ribulose and fucose as the sole carbon source
based on nucleotide sequence homology, genes within rd <dig> and rd <dig> encode proteins that transport ribulose and fucose, respectively . to test this prediction, we determined if deletion of rd <dig> and rd <dig> affected the ability of tigr <dig> to grow in media containing either ribulose or fucose as the sole carbon source. in all instances tigr <dig>  t <dig> Ωrd <dig> and t <dig> Ωrd <dig> grew normally in regular c+y . however, neither tigr <dig> nor the mutants were able to grow in media containing ribulose  or fucose  as the sole carbon source . thus ribulose or fucose is not sufficient to support tigr <dig> growth despite the presence of rd <dig> and rd <dig> 

discussion
it is well established that the propensity of a s. pneumoniae isolate to cause invasive disease is dependent on the interplay between serotype and genotype. molecular epidemiology has demonstrated that invasive and non-invasive clones exist within invasive serotypes  <cit> . kelly et al. have shown that conversion of a virulent serotype  <dig> isolate to serotype  <dig> ablated virulence in mice, whereas conversion of a 6b isolate to serotype  <dig> lowered the ld <dig> by >100-fold  <cit> . it is also known that the genomic component of virulence  is dependent on the presence of horizontally acquired genes that complement the core genome. previously, we have demonstrated that rds known to contribute to virulence are unequally distributed among invasive and non-invasive isolates in a serotype-dependent manner  <cit> . likewise, the absence of non-core, non-rd associated virulence genes, such as those encoding the adhesin choline binding protein a , have been demonstrated to diminish the ability of an isolate to progress from the nasopharynx to the lungs and bloodstream  <cit> .

to date, rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been conclusively shown to contribute to virulence by deletion and disruption mutagenesis  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to determine if the  <dig> uncharacterized rds  also contribute to virulence. because all  <dig> rds are present in tigr <dig>  <cit> , we chose to use it as the parent strain for these analyses.

the fact that we were able to create deletion mutants deficient in rd <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, that these mutants colonized the nasopharynx of mice normally, indicates that genes within these rds were not essential in vitro nor required in vivo by tigr <dig> for asymptomatic carriage. given that the human nasopharynx is the sole ecological niche of s. pneumoniae, this finding is consistent with the fact that rds are not present in all clinical isolates and serve as accessory genes. notably, we were unable to create a mutant deficient in rd <dig> despite several attempts. rd <dig> encodes a protein homologous to the high affinity phosphate transport system  regulatory protein, phou. studies have shown that pstsabc is expressed in response to low levels of phosphate and that deletion of phou in strain r6x has pleiotropic effects including delayed growth and an inability to undergo autolysis  <cit> . thus, one possible explanation for our inability to create an rd <dig> mutant is that its deletion negatively impacts the ability of tigr <dig> to acquire phosphate.

challenge of mice with the panel of rd mutants demonstrated that genes within rd8b <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were required by tigr <dig> to cause invasive disease. given that mutants deficient in these rd colonized the nasopharynx normally, it can be inferred that these loci encode virulence determinants that are not required for colonization but instead facilitate spread of the bacteria to normally sterile sites. how these loci contribute to virulence remains to be determined.

rd <dig> is composed of two pathogenicity islands located adjacent to each other on the tigr <dig> chromosome. previously, using comparative genomic analysis, we determined that the presence of rd8a was positively correlated with the ability of serotype 6a and 6b clinical isolates to cause invasive human disease. likewise, we determined that genes within rd8b were correlated with the non-invasive phenotype  <cit> . in this manuscript we demonstrate that deletion of rd8a has no impact on tigr <dig> virulence, whereas deletion of rd8b ablates tigr <dig> virulence. thus a discrepancy exists between the findings of this study and those from our previous comparative genomic analysis. one explanation for this discrepancy may be the differences in strains. comparative genomic analyses was performed using  <dig> clinical isolates of serotype 6a, 6b and  <dig>  whereas this study was limited to a single serotype  <dig> isolate. thus it is possible that genotype  and serotype dependent factors  have a large impact on the requirement of rds for virulence. this would be in accordance with the findings reported by kelly et al. that are described above, moreover, explain why rds known to be required for virulence in one strain are not found in others. for example zmpc, a zinc metalloproteinase encoded within rd <dig>  is present in only 25% of clinical isolates  <cit> . this finding also suggests that it is not possible to evaluate the role of any single gene or operon in any single strain or serotype.

possible roles of rd8b <dig>  rd <dig> and rd13
the operon rd8b <dig> is composed of  <dig> genes:  <dig> small hypothetical genes , a conserved domain protein , and a putative membrane protein . blastp analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of these genes finds homologues in other streptococci and gram-positive bacteria, but no indication of function with exception to sp <dig>  sp <dig> is identified as a member of the caax amino terminal protease family. members of this family include the bacteriocin-like immunity protein plnp from lactobacillus plantarum  <cit> . plnp mediates protection against highly charged cationic proteins that are expressed from the same operon. interestingly, sp <dig>  sp <dig>  sp <dig> are less than  <dig> amino acids in length and have a pi greater than  <dig>  sp <dig> and sp <dig> are less than  <dig> amino acids in length have a pi less than  <dig>  thus, sp <dig> may be an immunity-like protein that protects the bacteria from cationic and anionic peptides , that may serve to impair the host defence. future studies are warranted to determine if this is the case.

rd <dig> encodes a single operon composed of  <dig> genes. it encodes a transketolase, a ribulose phosphate 3-epimerase, a sugar phosphotransferase  system, and a transcriptional terminator. rd <dig> is also a single operon composed of  <dig> genes. it encodes an l-fucose isomerase, a fucolin-related protein, an l-fucose aldolase, a pts transport system, and a conserved hypothetical protein. thus rd <dig> and rd <dig> encode genes that may contribute to ribulose and fucose uptake.

in context with what is known in regards to rd <dig>   <cit>  and rd <dig>   <cit> , the finding that mutants deficient in rd <dig> and rd <dig> are attenuated suggests that acquisition of ribulose and fucose are essential for tigr <dig> during the disease process. unfortunately, tigr <dig> failed to grow in media that contained ribulose or fucose as the sole carbon source. this finding brings up the possibility that: 1) ribulose and fucose play a role in secondary metabolism, which indirectly contributes to virulence, but alone are not sufficient to support bacterial growth. 2) that these rds do not transport sugars and contribute to virulence in an undefined manner. as with rd8b <dig>  future experiments are warranted to determine the mechanism by which these loci contribute to virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of this study was to determine the virulence contribution of the  <dig> uncharacterized s. pneumoniae rds. having done so, we can now focus future efforts on characterization of genes within rd8b <dig>  rd <dig> and rd <dig>  future studies will focus on the role rd8b <dig> as a potential bacteriocin-like system that mediates virulence, and the requirement for fucose and ribulose in vivo. of the  <dig> s. pneumoniae rds identified by tettelin et al., and bruckner, seven have now been conclusively demonstrated to play a role in virulence. this strongly suggests that the propensity of an isolate to cause invasive disease is dependent on the presence of horizontally acquired genes that complement the core virulence genes present.
