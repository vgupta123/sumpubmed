BACKGROUND
the atp-binding cassette  transporter superfamily of genes is one of the largest in the genomes of both bacteria and eukaryotes  <cit> . using hydrolysis of atp to adp to generate energy, abc transporters move a wide variety of substrates across membranes, including ions, sugars, amino acids, polypeptides, toxic metabolites, xenobiotics, and drugs. therefore, they provide nutrients to a cell as well as protect it from both internally produced and exogenous toxins  <cit> . eukaryotic abc transporters usually consist of two types of domains, a transmembrane domain  and a nucleotide-binding domain . many abc proteins include two of each type of domain and are so-called full transporters. others are half transporters, containing one tmd and one nbd, and generate a functional unit by forming a homo- or heterodimer  <cit> . based on their primary sequences and the organization of their domains, the human abc genes were classified into seven families, from abca to abcg  <cit> ; an eighth abch family was discovered in the analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome  <cit> .

in humans, mutations of many abc genes are linked to hereditary disorders, such as adrenoleukodystrophy and cystic fibrosis  <cit> , and proteins coded for by many genes in the abc families b, c and g function as drug efflux transporters  <cit> . in parasites, products of abc genes have been implicated as factors contributing to resistance against chemotherapeutics  <cit> , and in insects, abc genes have been linked to pesticide resistance  <cit> . these medical and toxicological roles make abc transporters important in pharmacological research  <cit> , therapeutic applications  <cit> , and toxicology  <cit> . extensive investigations of abc transporters in bacteria and multicellular eukaryotes have been done  <cit> , but studies in unicellular eukaryotes other than yeasts have been limited to parasitic species  <cit> . clearly, the abc transporter superfamily in unicellular free-living species requires additional study.

tetrahymena is a free-living ciliated protist found in freshwater environments around the world  <cit> . at the cellular level, its structural and functional complexity is equal to or greater than that of individual metazoan cells. studies on tetrahymena have led to numerous scientific breakthroughs, and a number of molecular genetic technologies and genomic resources have recently been developed  <cit> . in particular, the tetrahymena genome database  and tetrahymena genome expression database   <cit>  provide the opportunity for analysis of both the functional and evolutionary characteristics of gene families at the genomic level in this model organism  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified  <dig> abc transporter genes in the tetrahymena thermophila macronuclear genome. the locations of introns, evolutionary relationships and expression patterns of these genes were characterized. a detailed analysis showed that the evolutionary and functional divergence of tetrahymena abc transporters has resulted from a combination of gene duplication, mutation, pseudogenization, and changes in gene expression.

RESULTS
identification and classification of abc transporter genes in t. thermophila
a total of  <dig> putative abc transporter genes were identified in t. thermophila , making it the largest superfamily of abc transporter genes described in any species to date. all of the genes could be grouped into eight families based on organization of domains, blastp scores, and placement in phylogenetic trees. their phylogenetic relationships are shown in the ml tree .

the abca family comprises  <dig> full transporters and  <dig> half transporters. the gene model for one full abc transporter gene, abca <dig> , was predicted incorrectly by tigr. our rt-pcr results showed that this "monster" gene was, in fact, two full-transporter genes, i.e., abca12- <dig> and abca12- <dig> . in vertebrates, the abca family is composed entirely of full transporters, and in the plant arabidopsis all are half transporters  <cit> . however, both full and half transporters have been found in another protist, dictyostelium  <cit> . no abca genes have been identified in yeast  <cit>  . three abca genes  in tetrahymena are highly similar to the suabca gene in sea urchins, which was found in sperm membrane vesicles and is involved in changing the immature sperm membrane to produce the terminally differentiated mature spermatozoa  <cit> . these three tetrahymena abca genes were markedly up-regulated during starvation, and the high levels of expression were maintained during conjugation. starvation induces physiological changes that prepare cells of different mating-types to form mating pairs  <cit> ; therefore, these abca genes may be involved in inducing and/or sustaining conjugation.

a one incorrectly predicted gene was identified

b includes a gene annotated as  <dig> in a previous report, but revised as tmd-nbd in the current version of the annotation

c includes  <dig> genes with a structure tmd-nbd and  <dig> genes with a structure nbd

d this gene has three tmds and one nbd

e includes the abch family of gene

the abcb family consists of  <dig> full transporters and  <dig> half transporters. among those, one full transporter, abcb <dig> , possesses both one abcb-like nbd  and one abcc-like nbd . the mixed structure of this gene was verified by sequencing its cdna between the first nbd and second tmd . the abcb <dig> gene was grouped into the abcb family according to the higher similarity of its nbd  to abcb-like nbd.

two abcb genes  in tetrahymena were predicted to have a mitochondrial localization by the predotar program . the half transporter abcb <dig> has an abc_atm <dig> domain  that resembles the nbd of human abcb <dig> and the yeast atm <dig> gene, both of which are involved in the transport of the fe/s binding protein into mitochondria  <cit> . there is an abc_mtabc <dig> domain  in abcb <dig> that resembles the nbd of human abcb <dig>  which has been shown to be associated with iron transport and is located in the mitochondrial membrane  <cit> .

the human abcb <dig> gene mdr <dig>  encodes a well-studied p-glycoprotein that has been shown to confer resistance to or transport a wide variety of anticancer agents. the mdr protein is thought to transport both endo- and xenobiotics and protect cells from toxic agents  <cit> . the abcb <dig>  of t. thermophila shares a  <dig> % amino acid identity with mdr <dig>  which is higher than that between the human p-glycoprotein and its ortholog ste <dig> in the yeast   <cit> . a protein composed of both  <dig> and  <dig> kda subunits has been reported to function in t. pyriformis as an efflux pump similar to mammalian mdr <dig>  <cit> , and a putative p-glycoprotein in t. pyriformis  has been described. the abcb <dig> of t. thermophila shares a  <dig> % amino acid identity with a putative p-glycoprotein of t. pyriformis and is induced by ddt, but not by either tcdd or β-estradiol . thus, the abcb <dig> protein might function as a substrate-specific mdr,

the abcc family comprises  <dig> full transporters and thus represents the largest family of abc transporters in t. thermophila. in the human genome, nine abcc genes encode the multidrug resistance proteins , which contain a core domain of tmd similar to p-glycoprotein, with the difference that some of them have an extra tmd at their n-terminal region to form the structure tmd-tmd-nbd-tmd-nbd. mrps transport xenobiotics coupling glutathione , which is a major feature distinguishing them from p-gp; therefore mrps also are recognized as gs-x pumps  <cit> . in t. thermophila, no extra tmd was found at the n-terminal region of abcc proteins, but an extra gst_mu domain was present at the c-terminal region of abcc <dig> . xenobiotics are fused with gsh by glutathione s-transferases at phase ii, and then the complexed substances are transported by mrps at phase iii, suggesting a coordinated action of gsts and mrps  <cit> . abcc <dig> is a mrp-like gene and the gst_mu domain may indicate that it functions similarly to recognize such gst-complexed substances.

the abcd family contains only  <dig> half transporters. the abcd families of most other organisms also consist of a low number of half transporters except for that of the plant arabidopsis thaliana, which includes both a full and a half transporter  <cit>  . members in this family that have been studied are all targeted to the peroxisome, where they regulate the transport of long-chain fatty acids  <cit> . in yeast, two abcd half transporters  were found, and these two half transporters form a heterodimer that functions in the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids  <cit> ; in humans, there are four abcd genes  <cit> , the human abcd <dig> is responsible for the x-linked form of adrenoleukodystrophy as a homodimer  <cit> . the abcd <dig> and abcd <dig> genes of t. thermophila exhibited the same pattern of expression  during the physiological/developmental stages of growth, starvation and conjugation , suggesting that a heterodimer may also be their functional form.

the abce and abcf families each contain only two nbds without tmds in t. thermophila. almost all eukaryotes also have only one abce gene except a. thaliana, which has two  <cit> . in tetrahymena, also one abce gene has been identified. in animals, abce has been shown to inhibit rnase l, a double-stranded rna nuclease, and is referred to as rli  <cit> . many intron positions within abce <dig> genes are conserved in animals and plants, especially in vertebrates ; therefore, it has been suggested that most of these introns  were ancestral in nature and that many introns have been lost in other species   <cit> . the abce <dig> of t. thermophila contains  <dig> introns; however, it shares no intron positions with abce1s of animals and only one with that of arabidopsis, suggesting that the timing and mechanism of intron gain and loss in the abce <dig> gene of t. thermophila may have differed from those of opisthokonts and plants. for the abcf family, a well studied gene is the gcn <dig> of yeast, which has been shown to regulate translation in amino acid-starved cells by interaction with eukaryotic initiation factor  <dig>  and ribosomes  <cit> . in tetrahymena, two abcf genes were found; one of the two genes  showed a high expression level in the three stages of t. thermophila life cycle, indicated a constitutive function of this gene.

the abcg family includes  <dig> full transporters and  <dig> half transporters. members of the abcg family are structured as nbd-tmd or nbd-tmd-nbd-tmd that have a tmd at the c-terminal region of nbd, an orientation inverse to that of the abca, abcb, abcc and abcd families. human abcg <dig>  first identified in cells from placentas and breast cancers, is a multidrug resistance abc transporter gene different from both mdr <dig> or mrp <dig> and is known as breast cancer resistant protein . a half transporter, bcrp functions as a homodimer or tetramer bridged with disulfide bonds  <cit> . expression of abcg <dig> is induced by ddt t. thermophila, and it shares  <dig> % amino acid identity with bcrp, suggesting that it might have the same basic function .

the abch family was identified in drosophila  <cit> , and lacks members in mammals and c. elegans. the function of abch is unknown. tetrahymena has  <dig> abch genes, both of which have a single nbd. the abch <dig> gene of the social amoeba d. discoideum has the same structure  <cit> . however, genes of the abch family encode a half transporter with an nbd-tmd structure in d. melanogaster and a. gambiae  <cit> .

the evolution of abc transporters in tetrahymena
all n-terminal nbds  and c-terminal nbds  of full transporters and nbds of half transporters  were used to construct the ml tree . it showed that nbds in the same family clustered together except for the abcc family . the relationship of the eight families was similar to that previously reported in dictyostelium  <cit> . comparative genomics analyses of abc transporters suggested that the ancestral abc transporters arose before the differentiation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . in another analysis using  <dig> evolutionarily diverse eukaryotes, those nbds in the same family still cluster together . these results suggest that the eight abc transporter families may have diverged prior to the last universal common ancestor  of existing eukaryotes.

many proteins are composed of at least two domains, and it has become clear that the formation of new domain combinations is an important mechanism in protein evolution  <cit> . in most cases, but not always, the eukaryotic abc transporters are composed of two or four domains through various combinations of tmds and nbds. half transporters are composed of a single tmd domain fused to an nbd domain, a structural organization that could be symbolized as tmd-abc or abc-tmd  depending on the n- or c-terminal location of the tmd domain. full-size transporters are probably generated by duplication and fusion of "half-size" transporters and are symbolized as  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . in our analysis, three phylogenetic relationships were found among the three kinds nbds  in an unrooted tree, corresponding to the abca, abcb and acbg families respectively. in the abca family, nbds- <dig>  showed a distant relationship to nbds- <dig>  and closer relationship to nbds-half  , which indicated the possibility that the abca full transporter fused from two distinct half transporters, which we refer to as "heterogenous" fusion. in the abcb family, nbds- <dig>  showed a close relationship to nbds- <dig>  and a more distant relationship to nbds-half  , which indicated the possibility that the abcb full transporter formed by fusion of two high similarity half transporters, referred to as "homogenous" fusion. the abcg family possesses three full transporters with a reverse domain organization. neither nbds- <dig>  nor nbds- <dig>  associated into separate cluster but, instead, were dispersed among the cluster of nbds-half  . since there are no abcg full genes in the p. tetraurelia genome, this result indicates that the t. thermophila abcg full transporters originated after these two species diverged. nbds- <dig> and nbds- <dig> of two full genes  are in the same group  , while two nbds of the other abcg full transporter  cluster into two groups . although the ancestor could not be determined in an unrooted tree, these three pairs of nbds seem to correspond to "homogenous" and "heterogenous" fusions. in addition, the abcc family members were all full transporters with distant relationship of nbds- <dig> and nbds- <dig>  also may have undergone a heterogenous fusion process.

possession of a large number and variety of abc transporters is a significant characteristic of t. thermophila, and we carried out an analysis to discover whether this results from numerous, lineage-specific duplications and when these duplications occurred. first, a phylogeny of nbds was used to investigate the evolution of all of the  <dig> t. thermophila abc transporter genes, using both full transporters  and half transporters  . a strong correlation was observed between the conservation of intron positions and phylogenetic relationships of abc transporters, except for some scattered examples which may have resulted from recent intron-gain events. next, full and half transporters in the abca, abcb, abcc, and abcg families were divided into groups. within each group, the locations of introns were conserved, indicating that intron gain and loss had occurred before the evolutionary expansion of each family. the abca, abcb, abcc, and abcg families were massively expanded, containing  <dig> clusters of tandem repeat genes that comprised a total of  <dig> genes . the abcg family had the most clusters, six with a total of  <dig> genes, and its largest single cluster had  <dig> tandem genes. the sequence identities of proteins in each tandem cluster ranged widely  and correlated with values of ks for these tandem genes. however, several tandem repeats had a low ks  , and notably, genes within tandem clusters were more closely related to each other than to those in other clusters. this suggests either that duplication events had occurred relatively recently within the clusters of tandem genes or that some mechanism results in the concerted evolution of these genes.

the abca family can be divided into  <dig> groups including two groups of half transporters  and four groups of full transporters , suggesting that tetrahymena inherited at least  <dig> abca transporter genes from its ancestor. regarding the expansion of full transporter genes, it was significant that the tree topologies of full transporter nbds- <dig> and nbds- <dig> were surprisingly similar . this suggests that these genes evolved as full transporters first and then became expanded. thus, three genes ancestral to full transporters expanded to form groups1- <dig>  containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively .

similar phenomena also were observed in the abcb  and abcc families . the abcg family differed from the others in being composed mainly of expanded half transporters-- <dig> ancestral genes expanded to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . more than 90% of the abcg genes in tetrahymena are half transporters that are more similar to one another in their sequences than to other abc transporter families , which indicates either very recent expansion, higher negative selection or highly concerted evolution of these genes.

after the phylogenetic analysis of nbds within tetrahymena, we compared the detailed compositions of abc transporter families in tetrahymena to those of other eukaryotes . tetrahymena, with a predicted proteome of  <dig> genes, possesses  <dig> more abc transporter genes than those of p. tetraurelia, its closest sequenced free-living ciliate which has been shown to have undergone three whole genome duplications   <cit>  resulting in a predicted proteome of  <dig> genes. tetrahymena and paramecium probably branched off ~ <dig> mya, yet only  <dig> orthologs of abc transporters between paramecium and tetrahymena were found using a reciprocal blast search ; therefore, 86% of abc genes in tetrahymena appear to have evolved after divergence of these two species. the pairwise ks values of  <dig> sets of abc transporter genes  fell mainly between  <dig> - <dig>  . rebecca et al  compared the evolutionary rates of proteins among animals, plants and ciliates using ka/ks and concluded that the genomic architecture of ciliates has experienced the highest rate of evolution, at least  <dig> - <dig>  times greater than in any other major group of eukaryotes investigated to date  <cit> . an overall rate of  <dig>  mutations per silent site per billion years in tetrahymena can be calculated using the overall rate of mutations in arabidopsis  as a basis for calculation, with a normalization of  <dig>  fold,  <cit> . if this is correct, then most of the duplications of abc genes in t. thermophila probably occurred between  <dig> - <dig>  mya ago. however, it should be noted that this is a preliminary estimate, and further analysis of the general rate of protein evolution at the genomic level will be required for a more precise calculation.

comparisons of tetrahymena with other alvelolate protists, such as the apicomplexans babesia bovis and plasmodium yoelii, or more distantly related model organisms, such as s. cerevisiae, d. discoideum, a. thaliana and h. sapiens, also suggest that the superfamily of abc transporters in tetrahymena not only has a higher absolute number of genes but also represents a higher percentage of the predicted proteome . the large size of this family in tetrahymena may result from either an increased rate of gene duplication or a low rate of loss. moreover, it has been shown in tetrahymena that only genes associated with sensing of and responding to environmental changes  have undergone such large-scale, lineage-specific expansions resulting in a higher number of genes than in other eukaryotic taxa, including the other free-living protists  <cit> . this suggests that the enlargement of several abc transporter families in t. thermophila resulted from relatively a high duplication rate.

functional divergence of abc gene duplicates in tetrahymena
gene duplication is a primary source of new genes with novel or altered functions  <cit> , and a comprehensive classification of all models for the evolution and maintenance of gene duplication has been provided in a recent review  <cit> . a study of the patterns of expression is one important measure of functions of a gene that could facilitate understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change  <cit> . the extensive duplications of genes in the abc transporter superfamily of tetrahymena provide a particularly good opportunity to investigate the functional consequences of gene duplication in a single organism.

we attempted to separate the effects of different modes of duplicate retention by categorizing the expression profile into four types  for the seven sets of gene duplicates and inferring their ancestral expression states for a comparison. tandem duplicates of abc transporters were chosen to represent relatively recent duplications, there being nine such duplicates distributed in six sets of genes . in addition, analyses of those gene sets were performed where applicable, including calculation of ka/ks values and sites under positive selection, the possibility of forming a heterodimer, and the inducibility to toxic exposure as accessory evidence. the following four different models could be inferred from these nine pairs of duplicates .

taxon or ancestral expression state:  <dig> = silent,  <dig> = low expression ,  <dig> = specific high expression and  <dig> = continuous high expression.

y = yes, n = no.

• neofunctionalization for four pairs. 1) the acba15-abca <dig> pair is likely to be undergoing a coding level neofunctionalization, since many sites were detected under positive selection for this pair . the loss of expression in one copy could have been shaped by a reduction of the formerly high constitutive expression, to perform a novel function related to, for example, a rare or low-concentration xenobiotics. 2) the abca17-abca <dig> pair showed the same expression pattern for the ancestral state and two descendants. similar to the abca15-abca <dig>  this pair has undergone coding-level neofunctionalization given the relatively high age of the duplication and a large number of sites under positive selection . 3) the abcb17-abcb <dig> pair had the same type of expression in the ancestral state as the two genes in the pair , whereas the abcb <dig> gene could be induced by exposure to ddt , suggesting that abcb <dig> might have evolved a new functional role. 4) the abcc10-abcc <dig> pair was inferred as having an ancestral state of high expression for specific conditions still found in the abcc <dig> gene, but abcc <dig> showed a continuous high level of expression . furthermore, positive selection on some sites also was detected in the four pairs ; therefore, the neofunctionalization model was determined to be the best one.

• subfunctionalization for one pair. the subfunctionalization model implies that duplicates partitioned the function of the ancestral gene and underwent a reciprocal rapid, partial loss of function  <cit> . two expression patterns would be consistent with this model: ancestral ubiquitous expression followed by both duplicates specializing their expression patterns, or high ancestral expression levels with low duplicated pair expression levels . in our analysis, the abcb1-abcb <dig> showed a relatively recent duplication , and more important, the ancestral state may have shown both expression patterns of the descendants prior to duplication , therefore, this pair is the most probable duplicates for subfunctionalization. however, simple gradual pseudogenization is another possible explanation for this pair.

• dosage balance for two pairs. the dosage balance model implies a positive selection for fixation of the duplicates, with both descendants maintaining the original function showing signs of negative selection at the coding level in preservation phase. this model may apply to genes involved in transport  <cit>  and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . with low ka/ks values, two pairs  showed the same type of expression in the ancestral state as in both duplicates, and these two pairs possibly form heterodimers based on their co-expression pcc values , indicating a dosage balance model for these two pairs. the expressed macronuclear genome of tetrahymena is effectively polyploid ; however, the retention of both members of a gene pair after duplication to enable an increase in the level of response to match exposure to substances  may still play a role in the evolution of abc transporter genes in t. thermophila.

• pseudogenization for one pair. the tandem duplicate abcg31-abcg <dig> showed a silent state during the entire life cycle of the t. thermophila , and no evidence of transcriptional inducibility from exposure to several toxic substances. the parsimonious ancestral expression state of this pair was also silent . since the duplication is fairly old and the pairwise ka/ks hints at negative selective pressure operating until quite recently , thus, a recent, rapid pseudogenization of both duplicates seems the most probable explanation.

•uncertain model for one pair. in the abcc52-abcc <dig> pair, one descendant  has a high expression level similar to that inferred for the ancestral state, and the other descendant  showed a specific expression pattern. given the relatively high age of the duplication , this pair seems unlikely to be involved in a slow, step-wise subfunctionalization because expression loss of te one copy is expected to be a rapid process. since only two sites have been detected under positive selection, the possibility that this pair underwent a coding-level neofunctionalization process is also seemingly low. a gradual pseudogenization process that led to the step-wise loss of expression in one copy was possible, where such loss would have to be relatively recent due to the low ka/ks values of this pair. however, the lack of certainty in regard with their ancestral state further made the situation less clear. therefore, we thought it is hard to suggest one best model for the abcc52-abcc <dig> pair.

network asymmetry in which one gene in a pair acquired more co-expressed genes than the other  could be identified in many tandem duplicate pairs in the seven sets of genes, indicating that each of the two duplicate genes could be involved in a different pathway or biological process. a similar phenomenon also has been reported in yeast  <cit> . finally, six genes were found to be up-regulated under stress from ddt and one by exposure to tbt . this of suggests that there may be more duplicates that have been preserved in the genome through neofunctionalization or dosage balance.

CONCLUSIONS
t. thermophila possesses a total of  <dig> abc transporter genes, the largest number in this superfamily reported for any organism to date. the reason for tetrahymena having so many abc transporters is probably related to its lifestyle as a highly dispersed, free-living unicellular organism. for multicellular organisms and parasites, the cells are in more stable environments, whereas tetrahymena must survive exposure to all the substances and organisms in the fresh water that surrounds it, and thus would benefit from having a large number of diverse genes to enable it to sense and respond to this correspondingly diverse and ever-changing set of environmental conditions. there is evidence that these genes have undergone lineage-specific expansions  <cit> , creating a large, diverse complement of abc transporters that could be involved in the efficient efflux of numerous endogenously produced toxins or elimination of a broad range of xenobiotics. the phylogenetic analyses, characterization of intron positions, and ortholog comparisons performed in the present study facilitated both the identification of progenitor genes and formation of strong hypotheses to explain the evolutionary origin and expansion of the abc transporter superfamily in tetrahymena. our analyses indicated that the fusion of domains or half transporter genes played a role in the evolution of the diversity of abc transporters in tetrahymena along with gene expansion by duplication. these duplicates appear to have experienced subsequent divergence by accumulation of mutations and differences in expression patterns. multiple different mechanisms including neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, pseudogenization and dosage balance appear to account for this functional divergence.
