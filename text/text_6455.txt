BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic escherichia coli  and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  represent two of the at least six different categories of diarrheagenic e. coli recognized at present  <cit> . unlike other diarrheagenic e. coli, epec and stec share the ability to introduce attaching-and-effacing  lesions on intestinal epithelial cells. a/e lesions are characterized by destruction of the microvillus brush border through restructuring of the underlying cytoskeleton by signal transduction between bacterial and host cells, intimate adherence of strains to the intestinal epithelium, pedestal formation and aggregation of polymerized actin at the sites of bacterial attachment  <cit> . the genetic determinants for the production of a/e lesions are encoded in a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> . the lee encodes the outer membrane protein intimin, which is encoded by the eae gene  localized in the central region of lee, a type iii secretion system, a number of secreted proteins , and tir , a protein encoded upstream of the eae gene, which is translocated into host cells  <cit> . characterization of eae genes revealed the existence of different variants. at present,  <dig> genetic variants  have been identified   <cit> . the heterogeneous c-terminal  end of intimin is responsible for receptor binding, and it is discussed that different intimin variants may be responsible for different host and tissue cell tropism  <cit> . adu-bobie et al.  <cit>  found that antigenic variation exists within the cell-binding domain of intimins expressed by different clinical human epec and stec isolates and defined four intimin types  based on type-specific pcr assays that used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 3'end of specific eae genes. oswald et al.  <cit>  described a type-specific pcr assay which identifies a fifth intimin variant . they divided the intimin alleles α, β, and γ based on restriction fragment length polymorphism  analysis of pcr products into α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  γ <dig> and γ <dig> subtypes. furthermore, oswald et al.  <cit>  reclassified the δ type of adu-bobie et al.  <cit>  as a β <dig> subtype . tarr and whitam  <cit>  presented a paper on the molecular evolution of intimin genes in human stec and epec o <dig> clones and found two new types . the new ζ intimin type also was identified by jores et al  <cit>  in bovine stec and blanco et al.  <cit>  in ovine stec. zhang et al.  <cit>  observed that the sequences of eae-γ <dig> and eae-θ were almost identical , and they believe that these two sequences should be considered one eae variant , as is referred in the present study. recently, zhang et al.  <cit>  determined the sequences of three new intimin variant genes  found in human stec strains. the sequence of the 3'variable region of eae gene of a new intimin  has been submitted to genbank by china   and the whole intimin λ gene was sequenced by blanco et al.  from a human strain  and ramachandran et al.  <cit>   from a bovine strain. ramachandran et al.  <cit>  identified three new intimin genes in ruminant e. coli strains belonging to serotypes ont:h- , o2-related:h <dig>  and ont:hnt  and they have also developed an intimin typing pcr-rflp scheme that reliably differentiates  <dig> intimin variants. when ramachandran et al.  <cit>  submitted to genbank the nucleotide sequences of μ, ν, and ξ genes these intimin types were designated ι <dig>  ε <dig> and β <dig>  respectively. blanco et al.  <cit>  have identified four new intimin variant genes that they originally designated as β <dig>  μ, ν, and ξ when the sequences were submitted to embl nucleotide sequence database, and before knowing the results obtained by ramachandran et al.  <cit> . the intimin β <dig> found by blanco et al.  in human typical epec strains of classical epec serotype o119:h <dig> is identical to intimin ξ described by ramachandran et al.  <cit>  in one bovine strain of serotype ont:hnt. thus, in this study our β <dig> intimin is referred as ξr/β2b. the other three intimins  discovered by blanco et al.  are different to the existing intimin types and are referred to as μb, νb, and ξb in this study, respectively.

epec strains are defined as eae-haboring diarrheagenic e. coli that possess the ability to form a/e lesions on intestinal cells and that do not possess shiga toxin genes  <cit> . most epec strains belong to a series of o antigenic groups known as epec serogroups: o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  epec are further classified as typical, when possessing the eaf  plasmid that encodes localized adherence  on cultured epithelial cells mediated by the bundle forming pilus ; whereas atypical epec strains do not possess the eaf plasmid  <cit> . typical epec, a major cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries, are rare in industrialized countries, where atypical epec seem to be a more important cause of diarrhea  <cit> . typical and atypical epec strains usually belong to certain serotype clusters, differ in their adherence patterns on cultured epithelial cells ; aggregative adherence ; localized adherence-like adherence ), are typically found in different hosts , and display differences in their intimin variants  <cit> . atypical epec appear to be more closely related to stec and as such are considered emerging pathogens  <cit> .

stec are responsible for a number of human gastrointestinal diseases, including diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis . in a proportion of individuals, particularly in children, these conditions may be complicated by neurological and renal sequelae, including hemolytic-uremic syndrome   <cit> . most outbreaks and sporadic cases of hc and hus have been attributed to o157:h <dig> stec strains  <cit> . in contrast, especially in continental europe, infections by non-o <dig> stec, such as o26:h11/h-, o91:h21/h-, o103:h <dig>  o111:h-, o113:h <dig>  o117:h <dig>  o118:h <dig>  o121:h <dig>  o128:h2/h-, o145:h28/h-, and o146:h <dig>  are more common and frequently associated with severe illness in humans  <cit> . probably, non-o <dig> stec also play a more important role in disease in argentina  <cit> , australia  <cit> , chile  <cit> , and south africa  <cit> . stec are characterized by elaborating two groups of potent phage-encoded cytotoxins called shiga toxins  <cit> . pathogenic stec very often possess other putative virulence factors as intimin  and enterohemolysin   <cit> .

although a number of studies have determined the eae subtypes of stec strains isolated from humans, only a limited number of studies have been undertaken to determine the intimin variants from a diverse collection of stec and epec isolated from cattle. ruminants, especially cattle, represent an important reservoir of atypical epec and stec  <cit> . this study reports information on the occurrence of eae positive e. coli carried by healthy cattle at the point of slaughter, and on serotypes, intimin variants, and further virulence factors of isolated epec and stec strains.

RESULTS
detection and isolation of eae positive e. coli strains
of the  <dig> fecal samples collected from cattle at slaughter,  <dig>  tested positive for eae genes. from  <dig> randomly selected eae pcr-positive samples,  <dig> eae positive e. coli strains were isolated by colony dot blot hybridization, confirmed as e. coli by biochemical properties, and further characterized by phenotypic and genotypic traits. thirty strains carried no stx genes and were therefore classified as epec, whereas the remaining  <dig> strains possessed at least one shiga toxin gene, and were therefore considered as stec.

serotypes of bovine eae positive e. coli strains
the  <dig> eae positive e. coli strains belonged to  <dig> o serogroups,  <dig> h types, and  <dig> o:h serotypes. however, 46% of strains were of three serogroups, namely o <dig> , o <dig> , and o <dig> , and 43% belonged to two h types, namely h <dig> , and h <dig> . thirty-two percent of strains were of only three serotypes: o26:h- , o103:h <dig> , and o145:h- . epec strains belonged to  <dig> o:h serotypes and eight strains were nontypeable . stec strains comprised seven o:h serotypes with one serotype  accounting for 48% of stec strains . furthermore, all serotypes found in this study have been previously reported in human stec. five  of the stec serotypes comprising  <dig>  strains have previously been associated with human stec causing hus. serotypes o26:h- and o103:h <dig> were found in both epec and stec strains.

typing of intimin  genes
overall, the  <dig> isolated eae positive bovine e. coli strains comprised a variety of  <dig> intimin variants, namely α <dig>  β <dig> , ξr/β2b , γ <dig> , γ2/θ , ε <dig> , ζ , η <dig> , ι <dig> , and κ . intimins α <dig>  δ/β2o, γ <dig>  θ/γ <dig>  ν r/ε <dig>  η <dig>  μr/ι <dig>  λ, μb, νb, and ξb were neither detected in bovine epec nor in bovine stec. epec strains harbored a variety of nine intimin variants . in  <dig> strains  eae-β , which was associated with nine serotypes, in three strains eae-ε <dig>  in three strains eae-ζ, in three strains eae-η <dig>  in two strains eae-ι <dig>  in two strains eae-κ, in one strain eae-α <dig>  and in one strain eae-γ2/θ were detected . in contrast, stec strains harbored only four intimin variants  with eae-ε <dig>  and eae-γ <dig>  being most frequently found . intimins β <dig>  ε <dig> and γ2/θ were present in both epec and stec strains.

identification of a new intimin variant gene . sequence comparison
the complete nucleotide sequence of the new η <dig> variant gene in three bovine bfpa and asta-positive epec strains of serotype ont:h <dig> was determined. furthermore, a fragment  of the 3'variable region of the eae gene of seven representative strains was amplified and sequenced. the eae sequences were deposited in the european bioinformatics institute  and the accession numbers assigned are indicated in table  <dig> 

by using clustal w for optimal sequence alignment, we determined the genetic relationship of the new intimin gene  and the remaining eae variants . thus, the eae-η <dig> sequence is very similar to eae-η <dig> . phylogenetic analysis revealed six groups of the closely related intimin genes:  α <dig>  α <dig>  ζ, and νb;  β <dig>  δ/β2o, κ, ξr/β2b;  ε <dig>  ξb, η <dig>  η <dig> and νr/ε2;  γ <dig>  μb, and γ2/θ;  λ ; and  ι <dig> and μr/ι <dig> 

further characterization of epec and stec strains
nine epec strains harbored the asta gene encoding for east <dig> . additionally, three asta positive strains of serotype ont:h <dig> harbored the bfpa gene encoding bundlin, whereas only one strain was positive for the eaf plasmid. overall,  <dig> different associations of serotypes with virulence factors were identified in epec strains.

of the  <dig> eae positive e. coli harboring genes encoding for shiga toxins, the majority  carried only stx <dig> genes,  <dig> strains only stx <dig> genes, and  <dig> strains both toxin genes . the only stx <dig> positive strains belonged to serotypes o5:h- , o103:h <dig>  and o111:h <dig> , the only stx <dig> positive strains to serotypes o26:h-, o26:h <dig>  o145:h-, and o157:h <dig>  and all the strains positive for both toxin genes to serotype o145:h-. moreover, the majority of stec strains  tested positive for the ehxa gene encoding for enterohemolysin. overall, ten different associations of serotypes with virulence factors were identified.

discussion
of  <dig> eae positive e. coli strains, 59% were classified as epec and 41% as stec. the serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> and serotypes o26:h-, o103:h <dig>  o145:h- were most frequently found. comparable distributions of epec  and stec  strains and serogroups  were reported in strains isolated from healthy cattle in japan  <cit> . of the typical epec serogroups , only six strains were found in the present study: four o <dig> strains, one o <dig> strain, and one o <dig> strain. in bovine stec strains, only a restricted number of serotypes have been most commonly found  <cit> : the predominant serotype in the majority of surveys realized in europe was o113:h <dig>  in america and australia o26:h <dig>  and in japan o45:h8/h- and o145:h-. as in the present study, authors in argentina, canada, france, germany, spain, and the united states have found that many stec recovered from cattle belonged to serotypes previously associated with human disease  <cit> .

intimin mediates the intimate bacterial attachment to the host cell surface of epec and stec, and is required for the formation of the characteristic a/e lesions. in epec and stec strains isolated from human patients and from healthy infants from germany and australia, intimin variants α <dig>  β <dig>  γ <dig> and γ2/θ were most frequently detected  <cit> . moreover, stec serotypes commonly recovered from outbreaks of hus and hemorrhagic colitis  typically possess intimin γ <dig>  γ2/θ, and β <dig>  <cit> .

overall, the  <dig> isolated eae positive bovine e. coli strains comprised a variety of  <dig> intimin variants, and most of them harbored eae-β <dig>  eae-ε <dig>  and eae-γ <dig>  as it is known that different intimin variants are associated with distinctive phylogenetic lineages of lee-positive e. coli  <cit> , the identified variety of bovine eae positive strains further substantiates the reservoir function of cattle for infections of humans with lee positive strains.

intimin β <dig> appears to be the most widespread variant  <cit> . in that it has been found in both epec and stec strains from humans and several animal species, and its presence is associated with multiple e. coli serotypes. strains harboring eae-β <dig> include important human diarrheagenic serotypes such as epec o26:h <dig>  o111:h <dig>  o114:h <dig>  o126:h <dig>  o128:h <dig> and stec o26:h11/h-, o118:h <dig> and o177:h-  <cit> , serotypes partly also detected in this study.

intimin ε <dig> was described for the first time in human and bovine stec of serogroup o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  <cit> . in this study, eae-ε <dig>  was detected in three bovine epec strains including one o103:h <dig> strain, and in all  <dig> bovine stec o103:h <dig> strains. furthermore, in a recent study performed on sheep in switzerland, intimin ε <dig> was detected in all stec o103:h <dig>  <cit> . stec o103:h <dig> strains have frequently been associated with hus and hemorrhagic colitis  <cit> .

intimin γ <dig> was restricted to stec and associated with serotypes considered as highly pathogenic to humans: o145:h-  and, o157:h <dig> . in addition to these serotypes, eae-γ <dig> was previously described in association with stec o145:h <dig>  and with epec o55:h7/h-, from which stec o157:h <dig> are believed to have evolved  <cit> .

interestingly, one bovine epec o157:h <dig> strain harboring eae-α <dig> was detected. moreover, eae-α <dig> was also recently detected in bovine epec o157:h <dig>  <cit> , in two epec o142:h <dig> isolated from monkeys  <cit>  and in a human stec o177:h <dig> strain  <cit> . these findings disagree with the suggested restriction of intimin α <dig> to human epec strains of serotypes o55:h <dig>  o127:h <dig>  h34/h-, o142:h <dig>  <cit> .

we have identified a new intimin gene  in three bovine bfpa and asta-positive epec strains of serotype ont:h <dig>  the complete nucleotide sequences of the new eae-η <dig>  variant genes of the three strains were determined. the new intimin η <dig> also was found in one epec ont:h <dig> strain isolated from a patient with diarrhea in spain by blanco et al. . recently, a food-borne outbreak of diarrhea involving  <dig> students  was reported in japan by yatsuyanagi et al.  <cit> . the implicated organism was a epec ont:h <dig>  which hybridized with the probes for eaea, asta and bfpa genes.

in our study, about one third of epec strains harbored asta as further putative virulence factor; whereas only seven epec strains harbored bfpa encoding bundling, the structural subunit of the bundle-forming pilus in typical epec strains, and only one epec of serotype o157:h <dig> was positive for the eaf plasmid. overall, bfpa seems to be isolated very rarely from bovine epec strains, since there are scarcely any reports of e. coli strains with bfpa isolated from cattle. however, in a recent study, we characterized  <dig> o157:h <dig> epec strains isolated from cattle in switzerland and found  <dig> bfpa positive strains among them  <cit> .

to assess the pathogenicity of stec, further evaluation of virulence factors in addition to serotype is necessary. o <dig> and non-o <dig> stec strains isolated from patients with severe symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, hc, and hus frequently show a typical virulence spectrum, with such strains tending to be stx <dig> and eae positive  <cit> . moreover, it was previously shown that bovine and human strains harboring the eae gene were statistically more likely to be positive for the ehxa gene encoding for enterohemolysin  <cit> . however, the impact of enterohemolysin, which was found in the majority of stec strains, is controversially discussed. additionally, stec commonly recovered from outbreaks of hus and hc typically possessed eae-β <dig>  eae-γ <dig> and γ2/θ  <cit> . in consequence, apart of the stx <dig> gene, which was previously reported to correlate with severe disease in humans, intimin subtyping may facilitate further understanding of associations among serotype, eae and stx subtype. in consequence, seven stec strains  showed a virulence pattern characteristic of highly virulent human strains: four o145:h- strains harboring stx <dig>  stx <dig>  eae-γ <dig>  and ehxa, one o26:h- strain harboring stx <dig>  eae-β <dig>  and ehxa, one o145:h- strain harboring stx <dig>  eae-γ <dig>  and ehxa, and one o157:h <dig> strain harboring stx <dig>  eae-γ <dig>  and ehxa.

CONCLUSIONS
our data confirm that ruminants are an important source of serologically and genetically diverse intimin-harboring e. coli strains. moreover, cattle have not only to be considered as important asymptomatic carriers of o <dig> stec but can also be a reservoir of epec and eae positive non-o <dig> stec, which are described in association with human diseases. the fecal carriage of foodborne pathogens among livestock animals at slaughter is strongly correlated with the hazard of carcasses contamination. in order to reduce the risk represented by stec and epec, the maintenance of slaughter hygiene is consequently of central importance in meat production.
