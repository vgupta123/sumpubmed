BACKGROUND
loss or insufficiency of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells is a critical issue for type  <dig> and type  <dig> diabetic patients  <cit> . transplantation of islets has been expected as a complete cure for diabetes mellitus  <cit> . however, it is difficult to supply sufficient β cells to cure patients because of insufficiency of donors. in addition, due to the growing number of diabetic patients, the development of novel strategies to produce β cells is urgently needed. because of their pluripotency, embryonic stem  cells are expected to be a viable source of β cells. many strategies utilizing growth factors and signaling pathways have been reported to initiate differentiation and modulate the course of cellular differentiation  <cit> .

mechano-stress such as shear stress, stretch stress, and electrical stress has been reported to modulate various intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . of those, electrical stimulation has been recently known to modulate fate determination of differentiating mouse es cells into neuronal cells, which are of ectoderm origin through ca2+ influx, and human es cells into cardiac cells, which are of mesoderm origin, through reactive oxygen species  production  <cit> . while the effects of electrical stimulation on the differentiation of es cells into ectoderm and mesoderm are known, its effect on the differentiation of es cells into pancreatic lineage, which is of definitive endoderm origin, remains unclear. we previously demonstrated that mild electrical stimulation with heat shock  stimulation synergistically ameliorates insulin resistance via enhanced insulin signaling in l <dig> skeletal muscle cells and hepatic hepg <dig> cells in vitro, and high fat diet or db/db diabetic mice in vivo . we have shown that met was more effective than mild electrical stimulation or heat shock alone. therefore, we investigated the effect of combination treatment of mild electrical stimulation and heat shock on the es cell differentiation into pancreatic lineage.

met stimulation on day  <dig> potentiated the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm
we next determined whether met stimulation affects the differentiation of es cells into e-cadherin+/cxcr4+ definitive endoderm or pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm at later stage of differentiation. es cells were stimulated with met on day  <dig> prior to the appearance of pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm, and analyzed on day  <dig> by flow cytometry . met treatment on day  <dig> had no effect on definitive endoderm population similar to day  <dig> stimulation. interestingly, however, the proportion of pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm population was increased  <dig> -fold in met-treated groups compared with control . this enhancement of the pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm population was statistically significant . increase of pdx1/gfp-expressing cells was also confirmed by fluorescent microscopy . endogenous expression of pdx <dig> mrna was assessed by q-pcr analysis. although it was not statistically significant, pdx <dig> mrna expression tended to be induced by met stimulation . collectively, met stimulation on day  <dig> potentiated the differentiation of es cells into pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm.

met stimulation on day  <dig> potentiated the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm induced by activin and bfgf treatment
we previously reported that activin and basic fibroblast growth factor  guide the differentiation of es cells into pdx1/gfp-expressing cells in definitive endoderm  <cit> . here, we investigated whether met treatment potentiates the growth factors-induced differentiation of es cells into pdx1/gfp-expressing cells. es cell differentiation was performed in the presence of activin and bfgf. met stimulation was done on day  <dig> before the expression of pdx1/gfp was detected. cells were analyzed on day  <dig> by flow cytometry . as shown in fig. 2b, met enhanced the differentiation of es cells into pdx1/gfp-expressing regional-specific definitive endoderm populations, but had no effect on definitive endoderm differentiation. this enhancement of the pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm population was statistically significant . in addition, endogenous expression of pdx <dig> mrna was also increased in met-stimulated groups assessed by q-pcr analysis . moreover, met treatment enhances the mrna expression of foxa <dig>  an important transcription factor for the differentiation of pancreas and liver . taken together, met stimulation potentiates the activin and bfgf-induced differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm.fig.  <dig> met stimulation enhances the generation of pdx1-expressing cells derived from mouse es cells induced by activin and bfgf. a experimental flow of met on es cell differentiation into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm . gf; growth factors . closed arrowhead indicates met stimulation. b es cells were stimulated by met on day  <dig> followed by facs analysis on day  <dig>  numbers indicate the proportion of e-cadherin+/cxcr4+ definitive endoderm cells within total es cell culture . numbers indicate the proportion of e-cadherin+/pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells within definitive endoderm cells . c percentage of differentiated cells/ total cells on day  <dig> co-treated with met, activin and bfgf was normalized with sham-treated control and indicated as fold change as assessed by flow cytometry . d met stimulation enhances the expression of pdx <dig> mrna expression in sk <dig> es cells. β-actin was used as internal control . values are the mean ± s.e. from  <dig> plates for c and  <dig> plates for d. statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test. *; p <  <dig> , ***; p <  <dig> , n.s.; not significant




met stimulation on day  <dig> up-regulated hsp <dig> expression and activated various kinases in mouse es cells
we investigated how met stimulation on day  <dig> potentiates the differentiation of es cells into pdx1/gfp-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm induced by activin and bfgf treatment. because we previously reported that met stimulation up-regulates hsp <dig> expression and activates akt signaling in hepatocyte and skeletal muscle cell line, we assessed whether met induces hsp <dig> and activates akt signaling in es cells. sk <dig> es cells were stimulated by met on day  <dig> after starting the differentiation in the presence of activin and bfgf. met induced the expression of hsp <dig> in es cells from  <dig> to 24 h after stimulation . akt phosphorylation was enhanced immediately after met treatment . because mitogen-activated protein kinases  are known to regulate the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells  <cit> , we next examined whether met activates mapks signaling pathways in es cells. es cell protein lysates were subjected to western blot analysis. met activated jnk immediately after stimulation, whereas erk and p <dig> mapks were activated at 24 h after met stimulation . collectively, met stimulation on day  <dig> induces the expression of hsp <dig> and activates various kinases including akt, erk, p <dig> and jnk.fig.  <dig> met stimulation on day  <dig> up-regulates the expression of hsp <dig> and activates various signaling pathways in mouse es cells. a, b, c sk <dig> es cells were differentiated into pdx1-expressing cells by activin and bfgf from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  on day  <dig> after starting the differentiation, met stimulation was performed, and activin and bfgf were removed by changing the medium. protein lysates were collected at the indicated time. pakt; phosphorylated akt, perk; phosphorylated erk, pp38; phosphorylated p <dig>  pjnk; phosphorylated jnk. densitometric analysis was done with imagegauge software. density of phosphorylated proteins was normalized by that of total proteins. statistical significance was determined by student’s t-test. *; p <  <dig> , **; p <  <dig> , n.s.; not significant. specific p values 




discussion
recent reports showed that electrical stimulation enhances the differentiation of es cells into neural cells in ectoderm or cardiac cells in mesoderm  <cit> . however, the impact of electrical stimulation on pdx1-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells in definitive endoderm remains unknown. we firstly identified met stimulation as a novel stimulus to induce es cell differentiation into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm . to our knowledge, this is the first report showing that applied electrical signal affects the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells. in addition, co-stimulation with met and growth factors resulted in differentiating es cells into pdx <dig> cells more efficiently, suggesting an important contribution of met to the development of pdx1-expressing cells . furthermore, as foxa <dig> was up-regulated by met treatment, it is possible that met also potentiates liver differentiation. future investigations on the effect of met on foxa <dig> will clarify a possible application of met in this area. because met stimulation is easy to use and economical, our findings also contain important implications with respect to macro-scale industrialization of regenerative medicine.

another interesting issue is that met stimulation on late definitive endoderm on day  <dig> enhances the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm population, whereas met stimulation on day - <dig>  or day  <dig> early definitive endoderm cells had no effect . recent report showed that gene expression profiles of differentiated es cells are totally different between day  <dig> and day  <dig> definitive endoderm populations  <cit> . although detailed molecular mechanisms still have to be investigated, it is possible that at day  <dig> late definitive endoderm, cells are able to sense met stimulation as differentiation signals but not the day - <dig> undifferentiated cells or day  <dig> early definitive endoderm cells.

we previously reported that met stimulation activates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase -akt signaling and up-regulates the expression of hsp <dig> . pi3k-akt signaling is crucial in the self-renewal of es cells, and the pdx <dig> up-regulation and differentiation from pancreatic ductal cells  <cit> . moreover, hsp <dig> is known as an anti-apoptotic molecular chaperone and to control the activation of smad <dig>  an important downstream molecule of activin signaling  <cit> . the up-regulation of hsp <dig> and the activation of akt were observed in es cells stimulated by met . in addition, erk, p <dig>  and jnk mapks were activated by met . because akt, erk, jnk, and p <dig> are important downstream molecules of bfgf signaling  <cit> , and p <dig> is a critical downstream kinase of activin signaling  <cit> , we propose that met activates these signaling pathways and subsequently induces es cell differentiation into pdx1-expressing cells. future studies will focus on the identification of molecules involved in sensing met stimulation as stimuli and transducing it to intracellular signaling pathways to potentiate the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, we reported in this study a novel procedure for inducing pancreatic progenitor cells, which express the earliest marker pdx <dig>  met stimulation enhances the differentiation of es cells into pdx1-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells within the definitive endoderm. met treatment synergized with activin and bfgf growth factors in differentiating es cells into pancreatic progenitor cells. our findings indicated that met stimulation has beneficial effects on the differentiation of pdx1-expressing cells within the definitive endoderm and suggest important application for regenerative medicine.
