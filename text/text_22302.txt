BACKGROUND
the development of high-throughput techniques has accelerated the sequencing of insect genomes and transcriptomes, leading to the rapid accumulation of insect gene data. currently,  <dig> insect genomes have been sequenced and were deposited in the ncbi genome database  <cit> , mainly from diptera, lepidoptera, and hymenoptera. hundreds of insect transcriptomes have been submitted to the ncbi sra database  <cit> . huge amounts of insect rna-seq data provide valuable resources to retrieve gene sequences and to estimate gene abundance by counting the read numbers  <cit> . however, major works on insect genome annotation and rna-seq analysis have been limited to protein-coding genes.

increasing evidence has showed that noncoding rna  genes exist widely in the genomes of almost all organisms  <cit> . ncrnas are arbitrary classified into two types based on their sizes. one type is small rnas, which are shorter than  <dig> nucleotides , including but not limited to micrornas , piwi-interacting rnas , small nucleolar rnas , and transfer rnas . the other type is long noncoding rnas , with transcripts longer than 200 nt that lack protein-coding potential  <cit> . the lncrnas located in the intergenic region are named as long intergenic noncoding rnas . lncrnas with transcripts longer than  <dig> kb are defined as very long noncoding rnas   <cit> . rna-sequencing  data are very useful resources to identify lncrnas. several international genome consortia, such as fantom, encode, getx, and modencode, have developed several computational approaches and identified thousands of lncrna genes from a variety of species . more than  <dig> lincrna genes were discovered in the human genome  and > <dig>  lincrnas were found in the mouse genome. by analyzing  <dig> samples and expressed sequence datasets,  <dig> lincrnas from  <dig> gene loci were identified from the pig genome  <cit> . in a chicken rna-seq dataset, li et al. found  <dig> novel lincrna genes associated with muscle development  <cit> . jenkins et al. used a computational pipeline to identify lncrnas from multiple anopheles gambiae deep rna-seq data, yielding  <dig> lncrna genes. these lncrnas showed differential expression across the life stages. the secondary structures of lncrnas are highly conserved within the gambiae complex  <cit> . as an important model organism, drosophila melanogaster has been extensively investigated for its lncrna genes. several efforts have identified  <dig> lncrna genes in d. melanogaster .

distinct roles have been characterized for only a small subset of lncrnas and the function of the vast majority of lncrnas remains unknown. several studies have shown that lncrnas play essential roles in a wide variety of fundamental biological processes, such as cell differentiation  <cit> , pluripotency maintenance  <cit> , transcription regulation  <cit> , epigenetic regulation  <cit> , dosage compensation  <cit> , and tumorigenesis  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, a yellow-achaete intergenic rna  affects sleep behavior. yar is conserved in drosophila species  <cit> . a neural-specific lncrna, crg, regulates the locomotor activity and climbing ability in drosophila  <cit> . these studies suggested that lncrnas have much more important roles than expected.

the rice brown planthopper, n. lugens, is one of the most destructive insect pests in rice production. it directly sucks the phloem sap and transmits viruses, causing huge yield losses. the rice brown planthopper has two types of wings, long wing and short wing. the wing dimorphism is regulated by insulin receptors  <cit> . the long-winged brown planthopper migrates from tropical to temperate regions in summer and then back to the tropics in the autumn. in the immigrant areas, the brown planthopper population increases very quickly in one or two generations. this notorious pest has repeatedly adapted to resistant rice varieties used for pest control  <cit> . the high fecundity and virulence adaptation of n. lugens are major factors causing the high damage to rice. insecticides are one of the most widely used methods to control rice brown planthopper. however, overuse of insecticides has resulted in resistance, resurgence, and residues. understanding the mechanism of high fecundity and virulence adaptation is important to develop alternative pest control strategies. here, we constructed a computational pipeline to identify lncrnas from rna-seq datasets of  <dig> samples of rice brown planthopper. we identified several lncrnas specifically expressed in a high fecundity n. lugens population and found that expression patterns of lncrnas varied between n. lugens strains/populations, suggesting that lncrnas might have key roles in the fecundity and virulence of the rice brown planthopper.

RESULTS
identification and validation of lncrnas in n. lugens
a computational pipeline was developed to identify lncrna genes from the n. lugens transcriptome . this pipeline was applied on  <dig> different n. lugens transcriptome datasets and yielded  <dig> transcript isoforms corresponding to  <dig> loci from 12 n. lugens rna-seq datasets . according to genome location, we divided these lncrna transcripts into seven types according to the guide of the hugo gene nomenclature committee   <cit> . intergenic lncrna transcript were named as bphlincxxx . intronic lncrnas, which occurred entirely within an intron were named as bphogsxxx-it. bphogs is the official gene set of protein coding genes. lncrnas that overlapped with a reference intron or exon on the opposite strand were named as bphogsxxx-as. lncrnas that overlapped with a reference exon or splice junctions on the same strand were named as bphogsxxx-ot. those lncrna that could not be classified as any of the above types and were regarded as unclassified and were named as bphlnc-unc.fig.  <dig> the computational pipeline for identifying lncrna genes in n. lugens from rna-seq data



the individual datasets were analyzed separately using the computational pipeline. in total,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrna genes were found in the 2-day-old adults of the lfp and hfp populations, respectively, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were identified in the fifth instar larvae of the lfp and hfp populations. a higher number of lncrnas  were discovered in the fat body, salivary gland, and antennae of the virulence-associated mudgo and tn <dig> populations.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> lncrnas were found in the wild, i87i, and c89i populations, respectively . there are several factors influencing the numbers of identified lncrnas in the different samples. the sequencing coverage is one of the major factors. in general, the higher the coverage, the more lncrnas could be identified . however, there were some exceptions. the sample of 2-days-old adults of the hfp population had the lowest coverage, but  <dig> lncrna genes were identified in this sample, suggesting that lncrna genes might have important roles in high fecundity. by contrast, the wild and i87i population had the highest coverage but they did not contain the most lncrnas.table  <dig> the numbers of lncrnas in individual rna-seq datasets of different n. lugens strains/populations and in the comprehensive rna-seq dataset

to confirm the reliability of the identified lncrna genes, we selected  <dig> lncrnas for rt-pcr validation. seventeen lncrnas were successfully amplified , suggesting that a high percentage of lncrnas detected by this pipeline were reliable in terms of expression. the transcription orientation of these  <dig> lncrnas were determined by strand-specific rt-pcr. sixteen out of them were successfully amplified. the results demonstrated that four lncrnas were transcribed from the sense strand whereas  <dig> lncrnas from the antisense strand .fig.  <dig> strand-specific pcr of  <dig> randomly selected lncrnas to determine the transcription orientation. bphogs10035448-as-ra was not amplified with a correct band. so,  <dig> lncrnas were successfully amplified and confirmed by sequencing . the results indicated that  <dig> lncrna transcribed from the antisense strand, and four from the sense strand. f: forward primer ; r: reverse primer ; rt: reverse transcriptase



structural features of lncrnas in n. lugens
we analyzed the structural features of lncrna genes in n. lugens. consistent with their counterparts in the mammals, n. lugens lncrnas had fewer exons than protein-coding genes .  <dig>  % of n. lugens lncrnas had only two exons, which is nearly twice the ratio of  <dig>  % observed in protein-coding genes. by contrast, only  <dig>  % of lncrna genes had four exons, which is significantly lower than  <dig>  % of protein-coding genes. the average transcript length of n. lugens lncrnas was 841 bp whereas that of protein-coding genes was 1106 bp . interestingly, lncrna genes had longer exons  and longer introns  than protein-coding genes . however, lncrnas had shorter transcripts than protein-coding genes because of the lower number of exons.fig.  <dig> structural gene features of n. lugens lncrna genes. a the number of exons per transcript of lncrnas and protein-coding genes. the majority of lncrnas have only two exons. b the transcript lengths of lncrna and protein-coding gene. on average, lncrnas have short transcripts. c the distribution of exon sizes of lncrna and protein-coding genes. d the distribution of intron sizes of lncrna and protein-coding genes. the density in y-axis means the area under the curve of a density function represents the probability of getting an x value between a range of x values. red: lncrna, green: protein-coding genes



only  <dig>  % of n. lugens lncrna genes had alternative splicing  , suggesting that as is not prevalent in lncrna genes. however, there were some exceptions. some lncrnas showed abundant alternative splicing events. bphogs10002343-ot and bphogs10000007-ot had  <dig> isoforms, and bphlnc-unc <dig> had ten isoforms . we selected bphlnc-unc <dig> to validate alternatively spliced transcripts. isoform-specific primers of ten alternatively spliced transcripts were designed. out of them, five isoforms were successfully amplified and were confirmed by sequencing . though there was a band in the lane of variant j, the pcr product size was not correct and the sequencing result was not as expected. possibly because of spatiotemporal expression of alternatively spliced isoforms, other four isoforms were not detected. we selected the 3rd, 4th, 5th instar nymph and adult to study the expression of five isoforms. semi-quantitative pcr indicated that bphlnc-unc241-ra and bphlnc-unc241-ri were highly expressed in the 3rd and the 4th instar nymph but lowly in other stages. bphlnc-unc241-rc was expressed only in the 3rd and 4th instar whereas bphlnc-unc241-rh only in the 4th instar. the mrna abundance of bphlnc-unc241-rg was high in all samples except the 3rd instar nymph . these results suggest that alternatively spliced isoforms of bphlnc-unc241-r have different expression profiles and might have differential functions during development.fig.  <dig> gene structures of three lncrna genes that had the most alternatively spliced isoforms. bphogs10000007-ot and bphogs10002343-ot have  <dig> spliced isoforms and bphlnc-unc <dig> has  <dig> spliced isoforms

specifically-expressed and differentially-expressed lncrnas
we estimated the transcript abundance of lncrnas using raw reads of all 12 n. lugens rna-seq datasets. the results indicated that most lncrnas were expressed in almost all n. lugens transcriptomes . interestingly, we found that the number of specifically expressed lncrnas was higher than that of differentially expressed lncrnas . in total, 19– <dig> lncrnas were specifically-expressed whereas 0– <dig> lncrnas were differentially-expressed in lfp, hfp, tn <dig>  mudgo, i87i and c89i population . there were  <dig> specifically-expressed lncrnas and ten differentially highly-expressed lncrnas in the adult of hfp population. one hundred and forty-eight specifically-expressed and two highly-expressed lncrnas were found in the fifth instar nymph of hfp population. in the adult and the fifth instar larvae of the lfp population,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were specifically-expressed while three and one lncrnas were highly-expressed. in the fat body and salivary gland of the mudgo and tn <dig> populations, there were only 21– <dig> specifically-expressed lncrnas and 0– <dig> differentially-expressed lncrnas. the high numbers of specifically-expressed lncrnas in lfp and hfp populations suggested that lncrnas might play key roles in the fecundity of n. lugens.fig.  <dig> the heatmap of the lncrna expression patterns in virulent and fecund populations. a expression profile changes of lncrna transcripts across the fat body and salivary gland in the mudgo and tn <dig> populations. b hierarchical clustering of expressional abundance of lncrna transcripts in the nymph and adult of the hfp and lfp population. the lncrnas showing tissue specific expression in the mudgo and tn <dig> populations are listed in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 9: tables s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  the lncrnas specifically expressed in the fifth instar nymph and adult were listed in additional file  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 13: tables s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> and s9



lncrnas associated with fecundity
it has been reported that lncrnas tend to be co-expressed with the overlapping genes or adjacent genes by sharing a same primary transcript. some lncrnas interact with overlapping or adjacent genes by chromosome modeling  <cit> . we found that 30 % of n. lugens lncrna genes overlapped with known protein-coding genes . in different samples, there were a number of lncrnas located within <  <dig> kb of protein-coding genes . the pearson correlation r of transcripts abundance between lncrnas and their adjacent protein-coding genes was  <dig> , which was significantly higher than the pearson correlation r  between lncrnas and randomly selected coding genes , suggesting that lncrnas tend to be co-expressed with their adjacent genes. interestingly, five lncrna genes overlapped with two protein-coding genes .fig.  <dig> the genome location of lncrna in n. lugens, demonstrating that lncrnas tend to located adjacently to protein-coding genes . a high number of lncrnas overlapped with protein-coding genes

fig.  <dig> the distribution of pearson product–moment correlation coefficient between lncrna and protein-coding genes. lncrnas had higher coefficients with their neighboring protein-coding genes than with non-neighboring genes, suggesting that lncrnas tends to be co-expressed with neighboring genes. the density in y-axis means the area under the curve of a density function represents the probability of getting an x value between a range of x values

fig.  <dig> gene structures of five lncrna genes. these lncrna genes had multiple isoforms and overlapped with two adjacent protein-coding genes



in the hfp population, there were  <dig> protein-coding genes that were co-expressed with lncrnas, among which  <dig> protein-coding genes involve in energy metabolism. in the lfp population, there were  <dig> protein-coding genes that were co-expressed with lncrnas, among which  <dig> protein-coding genes involve in energy metabolism. the protein coding genes associated with energy metabolisms were not located adjacently or overlapped with any lncrnas.

we found that three lncrna genes overlapped with reproduction-associated genes . two lncrnas  were specifically-expressed in the fifth instar nymph of the hfp population. one lncrna  was specifically-expressed in the fifth instar nymph of the lfp population. bphogs10005591-ot <dig> overlapped with the glucose dehydrogenase  gene at the 3′ region comprising 2365 bp. gld is essential for sperm storage in adult female of d. melanogaster. bphogs100007976-ot was located at the 5′-upstream of the gastrulation defective gene and overlapped with this gene for 3354 bp. the gastrulation defective gene encodes a serine protease that cleaves and activates protein snake. the activated snake cleaves and activates protein easter. this series of activations controls the embryo dorsoventral polarity. bphogs10035598-ot overlapped with the n-acetylgalactosaminytransferase  <dig> gene  at its 5′-end for 878 bp. galnt <dig> participates in reproductive regulation in d. melanogaster.fig.  <dig> exon and intron structures of three lncrna genes that were specifically expressed in the hfp or lfp population. these lncrnas overlapped with reproduction-associated protein genes encoding glucose dehydrogenase, gastrulation defective, and galnt <dig>  f: forward primer, r: reverse primer



we carried out rt-pcr to confirm the transcription of three lncrnas and their adjacent protein-coding genes using a wild population. the different combinations of primer-pairs were used to examine the transcripts. the results suggested that the identified ot-type of lncrnas were not the artifacts of full-length coding sequences. bphogs10005591-ot <dig> and bphogs10007976-ot were transcribed independently from there adjacent protein-coding genes whereas bphogs10035598-ot might share a same transcript with its adjacent protein-coding gene bphogs <dig> .fig.  <dig> amplification of three lncrnas overlapped with reproduction-associated protein genes. different combinations of primers pairs indicated that bphogs10005591-ot <dig>  and bphogs10007976-ot  were independently transcribed whereas bphogs10035598-ot  might share a same transcript with its adjacent protein-coding gene bphogs10035598




discussion
we identified  <dig> lncrna transcripts corresponding to  <dig> loci from 12 n. lugens rna-seq datasets including four transcriptome datasets of lfp or hfp fecundity strains, five transcriptomes from the fat body, salivary gland, and antennae of the virulence strain and three other different populations. blastn searching of n. lugens lncrnas against the ncbi nr and noncode databases found no highly similar sequences, demonstrating that lncrnas lack sequence conservation. however, it has been reported that an lncrna, yar, is conserved in drosophila species  <cit> . the lncrna secondary structures of a. gambiae were conserved within the gambiae complex  <cit> . here, we found that structural features of n. lugens lncrnas are similar to mammalian counterparts. we also performed rt-pcr and strand-specific pcr to confirm the expression of  <dig> randomly selected lncrnas. the results indicated that >80 % identified lncrnas were reliable. they were unlikely to be the artifacts of full-length coding sequences.

it has been reported that the functions of lncrnas can be inferred by analyzing their co-expression networks and genome locations  <cit> . in d. melanogaster, the lncrna crg positively regulates its neighboring ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, which is essential for locomotor activity and climbing ability  <cit> . 19–148 n. lugens lncrnas were specifically-expressed in the hfp, lfp, tn <dig> and mudgo populations, respectively. however, less than ten lncrnas were differentially-expressed in various samples. at least three specifically-expressed lncrnas, bphogs10005591-ot <dig>  bphogs100007976-ot, and bphogs10035598-ot, overlap with reproduction-associated genes that have important functions in sperm storage and embryo dorsoventral polarity. these lncrnas are also co-expressed with the reproduction-associated genes. according to the evidence of co-expression and genome-location, lncrnas might have important roles in regulating fecundity in n. lugens. we did not find any lncrna to be located adjacently to protein-coding genes associated with the virulence adaptation of n. lugens, possibly because the mechanism of virulence remains largely unknown. high fecundity and virulence adaptability are two main factors that underlie the great damage caused by n. lugens  <cit> . we found indication that lncrna might participate in the regulation of at least one of these two important biological processes, which should provide new insights into developing alternative eco-friendly pest-control policies for the rice brown planthopper. however, it should be noticed that the evidence presented here are not direct.

CONCLUSIONS
a computational pipeline was constructed to identify lncrna genes from the rice brown planthopper, yielding  <dig> lncrna transcripts corresponding to  <dig> loci. insect lncrnas shared similar structural gene features with mammalian lncrnas. 19– <dig> lncrnas were specifically-expressed in high fecundity or low fecundity populations. at least three of them were overlapped with reproductive-associated genes. in terms of genome-location and gene-expression, we presented some indications that lncrnas might play important roles in fecundity and virulence adaptation in n. lugens. function analysis of lncrnas is required to elucidate their roles in regulating fecundity and virulence adaptation.
