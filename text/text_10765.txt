BACKGROUND
haemorrhagic septicaemia  is an acute, fatal, septicaemic disease of cattle and buffalo caused by two specific serotypes of pasteurella multocida: b: <dig>  and e: <dig> . hs has a wide distribution, especially in south east asia and africa  <cit> . on the malaysian peninsula, a total of  <dig> outbreaks of hs have occurred between  <dig> and  <dig>  resulting in a total of  <dig> dead buffalo and  <dig> dead cattle  <cit> . a recent outbreak in india involving free-range cattle and buffalo resulted in  <dig> deaths, a mortality rate of  <dig> %  <cit> . in ruminants, natural exposure to p. multocida usually results in rapid disease progression, with typical clinical signs of severe depression, pyrexia, submandibular oedema, dyspnoea, recumbency and death. transmission is typically by carrier animals  <cit> , which are animals that have survived a previous outbreak  <cit> . previous studies on carriers were focused on the respiratory tract  <cit>  following detection of p. multocida b: <dig> in the tonsil, nasopharynx and upper respiratory tract lymph nodes  <cit> . both natural and experimentally induced stresses aggravate shedding and transmission of the bacterium  <cit> .

one recent study has indicated gastrointestinal tract involvement in acute hs  <cit> . however, there have been no studies on the role of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts in carriers and transmission of hs. this paper describes the experimental development of carrier buffalo and the role of gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of carrier buffalo in spreading hs.

RESULTS
clinical responses
all calves of group  <dig> were euthanised following development of advanced clinical signs; two were euthanised at 24 h post-infection, while the rest were euthanised at 48 h post-infection. affected calves appeared dull and depressed, recumbent, pyrexic, anorexic and dyspnoeic, with nasal discharge and diarrhoea.

on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after being mixed with the calves from group  <dig>  three calves  of group  <dig> were transiently pyretic, with average body temperatures of  <dig> °c ,  <dig> °c  and  <dig> °c , respectively . another calf  showed progressive pyrexia for more than 48 h and was euthanised because of severe clinical signs. the surviving calves in group  <dig> eventually became carriers. none of the calves in group  <dig> showed clinical signs.

gross pathology
in general, all calves of group  <dig> and one calf  from group  <dig> that were euthanised following the development of severe clinical signs had classic lesions of acute hs, including severe congestion and haemorrhage of mucosal surfaces, subcutaneous tissues and respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. fibrin was deposited on the serosal surfaces of all thoracic and abdominal organs.

the surviving calves of group  <dig> had multifocal pulmonary congestion and pneumonia. fibrin was deposited on the omentum, mesentery, peritoneum and serosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract. however, the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract appeared normal apart from the rectum, which had mild multifocal haemorrhages.

isolation and identification of p. multocida b:2
pasteurella multocida b: <dig> was successfully isolated from organ samples of all calves that were euthanised because of acute hs.

pasteurella multocida b: <dig> was cultured from nasal and rectal swabs collected on days  <dig> and  <dig> from the surviving buffalo calves  of group  <dig> on post-exposure days 5– <dig> and 15– <dig> . pasteurella multocida b: <dig> was also isolated from vaginal swabs of these calves on post-exposure days 15– <dig>  isolation was unsuccessful between days  <dig> and  <dig> and following the second and third courses of dexamethasone . at the end of the 43-day experiment, p. multocida b: <dig> was detectible via polymerase chain reaction  in the tonsils, lung, reticulum, ileum and ureter of calves 2a, 2b and 2c .

immunoperoxidase examination
the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of all surviving group  <dig> calves had mild to moderate p. multocida b: <dig> immunoreactivity. within the respiratory tract, immunoreactivity was noted in the nasal mucosa, tonsil, epiglottis, trachea and the lungs. in the nasal mucosa, the cells of nasal glands showed intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity  while the tonsillar epithelium and tonsillar crypts had immunoreactivity amidst cellular debris . rare immunopositive bipolar rods were detected on the tonsillar epithelium and crypts.

similar immunoreactivity was detected in the cells of serous glands, the epithelial cells of the epiglottis and on the epithelium of the trachea . in the lungs, positive immunoreaction was observed on the surface of pneumocytes. intracytoplasmic immunoreaction was observed in occasional infiltrating and degenerating alveolar macrophages . positive immunoreactivity was also detected in bronchiolar exudates that were mixed with desquamated bronchiolar epithelial cells.

within the gastrointestinal tract, all organs had immunoreaction except for liver and mesenteric lymph nodes. the rumen, reticulum and omasum had positive immunoreactivity beneath the keratin layer , while the abomasum was immunoreactive at the tips of the mucosal surface . similar positive reactions were found at the tips of the mucosal surfaces in all sections of small and large intestines and within rare infiltrating macrophages.

there was no immunoreactivity in any kidney samples. however, the ureter showed mild intracytoplasmic immunoreaction within the epithelial cells. few immunopositive bipolar rods were detected in ureteral lumina . similar mild immunoreactions were observed in sections from the urinary bladder, particularly in the urothelial cells .

there was no immunoreactivity in any tissues from calves in group  <dig> .

discussion
in this experiment, carriers were detected among surviving buffalo that were allowed to comingle with the infected buffalo, simulating field outbreaks of hs. in addition to carriers, commingling buffalo can die of hs, as observed in calf 2d. susceptible animals have been shown to rapidly succumb to hs following exposure to a high dose of p. multocida b: <dig>  because of either a high growth rate within the host or the presence of other virulence factors that enable the agent to overcome the host’s defense mechanisms. furthermore, poor development of specific and non-specific immunity of the host contributes to the development of acute hs  <cit> . the involvement and interactions between these factors are not fully understood  <cit> . if the host’s defense mechanisms prevail against the agent, the animals become carriers, as observed among the surviving buffalo calves of group  <dig>  <cit> . however, mixing naive animals with acutely infected animals to create carriers has the limitation of not being able to control the infection dose  <cit> . if the naive animals survive and become carriers, there may be individual differences in clinical signs, tissue tropism and disease course. it does have the advantage of more closely replicating field disease exposure.

administration of courses of dexamethasone to carriers simulated stress and immunosuppression  <cit> , leading to shedding and detection of p. multocida b: <dig> in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. this confirms the involvement of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts as potential transmission routes for hs by carriers following stress. this suggests a mechanism for outbreaks of hs that occurred during stressful monsoon seasons  <cit> .

immunoperoxidase staining localised p. multocida b: <dig> within the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of carriers. in hs, there are two types of carriers: active and latent. active carriers actively shed bacteria and the agent may be cultured or detected during a post-mortem examination. latent carriers do not shed bacteria but the agent can be cultured or demonstrated at low concentrations during post-mortem  <cit> . in this study, p. multocida b: <dig> was detected in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts at relatively low concentrations, which suggests these animals were latent carriers  <cit> . at the time of euthanasia, the agent could no longer be isolated, unlike previous studies  <cit>  and was associated with mild immunoreactivity on the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. demonstration of immunoreactive bipolar rods is consistent with infiltration of the tonsil, as suggested by previous studies  <cit> . however, this study localised p. multocida b: <dig> to the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts of carrier buffalo for the first time. while the tonsil may be the most important tissue reservoir in carriers, it is not the only organ of concern.

CONCLUSIONS
successful isolation of p. multocida b: <dig> from nasal, rectal and vaginal swabs suggests that buffalo that survive experimental outbreaks of hs become carriers. the organism is not only located in the respiratory tract as previously believed, but is also detectable in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, suggesting their involvement in the transmission of hs.
