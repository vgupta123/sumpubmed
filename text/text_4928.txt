BACKGROUND
rdx is known to contaminate soil and ground water associated with munitions manufacturing and artillery training sites  <cit> , some of which are listed on the national priorities list by the u.s. environmental protection agency  <cit> . rdx has also been targeted for future regulatory action under provisions of the safe drinking water act  <cit> . human health effects of rdx are well known to include the central nervous system as the critical target tissue for acute exposure to high doses as manifested by reversible seizure activity  <cit> . while many effects of rdx exposure are known, little is known about the mechanisms by which it causes toxicity.

primary cell cultures offer several advantages over animals in determining mechanisms of chemical toxicity. primary hepatocyte cells are freshly prepared from liver tissue by proteolytic digestion and enrichment of hepatocyte cells through centrifugation. these cells enable high throughput testing methods to examine toxicity. primary cell cultures can reduce concerns such as animal availability, cost, and welfare that limit the application of in vivo studies of chemical effects. however, the responses to chemical exposure in isolated cells may not reflect those of intact organs in animals especially as organs are often composed of more than one cell type potentially complicating direct comparisons. liver cell populations consist of approximately 85% hepatocytes along with other cell types: kupfer  cells, vascular endothelial cells and "ito" cells   <cit> . in addition, conservation of gene expression patterns in hepatocytes isolated from livers have been shown to diverge from liver tissue as the cells adapt to culture conditions  <cit>  and may respond to chemicals in a manner different from liver tissue  <cit> .

we examined in vitro exposed primary hepatocyte cells and in vivo exposed rat liver tissue to understand how the transcriptional responses of these systems compared after exposure to rdx. gene expression was analyzed in primary cell cultures exposed to  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> mg/l rdx for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. primary cell expression effects were compared to those in liver tissue isolated from female sprague-dawley rats  <dig> hours after gavage with  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> mg/kg rdx. samples were assessed within time point and cell type  to their respective controls using a loop design and 2-color,  <dig> k gene microarrays.

RESULTS
we have examined the gene expression responses in primary hepatic cells freshly isolated from liver tissue. exposure concentrations for transcriptional profiling of cells were selected based on the results of cytotoxicity assays, which indicated a complete lack of cytotoxicity at all levels of rdx tested. concentrations to which cells were exposed were similar to the  <dig>  mg/kg tissue found in liver  <dig> hrs after dosing with  <dig> mg/kg rdx  given the assumption that tissue is approximately 80% water and  <dig> gm/ml resulting in concentration of approximately  <dig> mg/l water.

comparison of expression in unexposed cells and tissue
gene expression was assessed using an oligonucleotide microarray capable of detecting  <dig> different rat genes. twenty five percent of all genes on the array were detected in control liver tissue, 48% of all genes in  <dig> hr control primary cells, and 66% of all genes in  <dig> hr control primary cells. analysis of go biological process terms associated with genes expressed in controls indicated significant differences both in the variety and type of biological processes present in cells and tissues prior to chemical exposure. liver tissues were associated with  <dig> different terms with terms related to amino acid metabolism and catabolism, lipid and fatty acid metabolism, and aromatic and drug metabolism being unique to liver cells.  <dig> hr cells were associated with  <dig> different terms with terms related to cell division, organ development, response to dna damage unique to  <dig> hr cells. forty eight hr cells were associated with  <dig> go biological process terms with terms related to cell cycling, protein modification, alkene metabolism, neural cell development, signalling, and regulation in addition to organ and cell differentiation, organization, and development. comparison of expressed genes in tissues and cells versus the list of those on an array can also reveal functions that are enriched in each particular cells type . relative to cells, liver tissues were significantly enriched in lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism, electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell adhesion-mediated signalling. twenty four hr cells were significantly enriched in protein folding, vesicle transport, protein traffic, and nucleic acid metabolism when compared to  <dig> hr cells and liver tissue. forty eight hr cells were enriched for genes involved in proteolysis and circulation in comparison to  <dig> hr cells and liver tissue.

comparison of expression in rdx exposed cells and tissue
the overall response of different tissues or cells to chemical exposure can be compared by determining the percentage of genes that were actually expressed. when the number of genes present on the array that were expressed in tissues or cells as determined by present/absent calls across all doses of rdx were compared, cell cultures were found to express a larger percentage of genes. across all doses of rdx, 54% of the genes present on the array were expressed in liver, 62% of all possible genes on the array were expressed by primary hepatic cells at  <dig> hrs and 68% at  <dig> hrs of exposure to rdx. primary cells at  <dig> hrs across all doses of rdx were more similar  to overall liver tissue expression patterns than primary cells at  <dig> hrs  when common expressed genes are examined. this data indicates that the cells are able to express many of the same genes expressed in liver tissues, a prerequisite for establishing similar responses.

hierarchical clustering analysis of the correlation matrix of the normalized microarray ratio data shows clustering according to tissue and exposure type. the correlation of expression between and within samples suggests that tissues and cells are responding differently to rdx exposure . principal components analysis of the same correlation matrix indicates that some similarity does exist between liver and cells exposed to rdx for  <dig> hrs . after fitting a mixed linear model to each gene, the resulting volcano plots  demonstrated that the numbers of significant differentially expressed genes  between the conditions  were substantially more than the numbers of deg due to the high dose treatment within the conditions . this indicates that different conditions, including between liver tissue and cell cultures, and between cell culture conditions, had greater impact on the gene expression profiles than the treatment. hierarchical clustering analysis of significant deg with bonferroni correction using anova also indicates that  <dig> hr exposed cells are most similar to liver tissue with little overlap between treatments and cell timepoints .

we used the abundance of genes in common between differentially expressed gene lists to compare the responses of primary cell and liver tissue to rdx exposure . depending on the significance level used to identify significant genes, up to  <dig> % of the differentially expressed genes in liver tissue at all exposures were also differentially expressed in  <dig> hr primary cells at all exposures. forty eight hr primary cells were less similar in differential expression to liver with up to  <dig> % of genes differentially expressed in common with liver.

analysis of differentially expressed genes held in common between conditions is a good indicator of relatedness. functional biological pathways often consist of multiple genes. therefore identification of shared pathways can be a more robust approach to comparing conditions. we compiled lists of pathways containing differentially expressed genes using ease to identify pathways in the kyoto encycloaedia of genes and genomes . approximately  <dig> % of affected genes had identifiable kegg pathways. twenty four hr exposed primary cells shared up to  <dig> % of the pathways found to be affected in liver tissue .  <dig> hr exposed cells shared up to  <dig> % of pathways with liver tissues.

the proteosome/protein and degradation kegg pathway was identified as significantly enriched in treated liver tissues . glutathione metabolism and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation were enriched in  <dig> hr treated cells . no significantly enriched pathways were detected in  <dig> hr treated cells. liver and  <dig> hr treated cells were similarly enriched in go terms such as main pathways of carbohydrate metabolism/energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds, and macromolecule biosynthesis. significant functional differences between primary cells and liver tissue were observed in enriched go terms not held in common between conditions .

significantly changed genes in individual doses and exposure times of primary cells were compared to those found in different dose treatments of rdx. this comparison was performed to identify which dose and exposure time combination in primary cells was most similar to effects seen in liver tissue. effects observed at  <dig> mg/l rdx for  <dig> hrs exposure had the highest number of genes in common with liver tissues at any dose of rdx.

discussion
we have compared the responses of an in vitro model system, primary hepatocyte cells, to that of livers in whole animals to determine the extent to which the model system faithfully represents in vivo effects. primary hepatic cells expressed  up to 88% of the same genes expressed by in vivo liver tissues when all control and rdx doses treatments were considered. the overlap in expressed genes indicates a significant conservation of global gene expression between the two systems. this is consistent with observations of others where primary hepatocyte cells maintained 80% similarity to liver tissue in global gene expression  <cit> . however comparison of expression in unexposed cells and tissue also illustrates significant functional differences that may exist between the different systems. the similarity of the in vivo and in vitro systems may be dependent upon length of time that the hepatocytes had been isolated from liver tissue rather than exposure time to toxicant. the similarity of basal gene expression in primary hepatocytes to that of liver has been shown to decrease as the isolated cells adapt to conditions in culture  <cit> .

the overall similarity of responses of primary cells and liver tissue to rdx exposure was far less conserved than global presence and absence of expressed genes. liver tissue responded differently to rdx than primary cells. less than  <dig> % of differentially expressed genes found in liver were also found in  <dig> hr or  <dig> hr primary cell exposures. this result is consistent with what boess et al.  <cit>  found, i.e. the limited overlap of significant degs from liver and two cell lines. however, the use of a p-value based rule for gene selection is not designed to maximize overlap; rather, it targets controlling the false positive rate in the final list. we used a conservative bonferroni cutoff to provide strict control on the false positive rate. even with this strict cutoff, almost  <dig> genes were considered differentially expressed. boess et al.  <cit>  further cautioned about the comparison of the gene-to-gene basis between in vitro and in vivo systems. studies comparing tumor tissues and tumor derived-cell lines have also indicated the considerable differences exist in gene expression between tissues and cell lines  <cit> .

biological functions enriched in differentially expressed gene lists highlight potentially major differences between primary cell physiology and liver tissue . general pathways and functions that were overrepresented in both liver tissue and  <dig> hr treated primary cells were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and macromolecule biosynthesis. enriched functions affected in  <dig> hr exposed primary cells that were not shared with liver were principally involved in cell growth, division, and proliferation . in  <dig> hr treated cells, protein degradation, fatty acid transport and transcriptional activity were enriched. in addition, several genes involved in apoptosis were differentially expressed although not significantly enriched in  <dig> hr treated cells. liver tissues were enriched in pathways related to ubiquitin dependent protein catabolism, lipid and protein metabolism, oxido/reductase activity and transferase activity on nitrogen containing groups. these differences may be due to certain pathways being induced due to the trauma of cell isolation and adaptation to culturing conditions , which overwhelms any response to the xenobiotics. alternatively, it may a consequence of biotransformation-related genes whose expression are known to be down-regulated after cell isolation, such as p450s. this in turn can alter both the duration of exposure and the compounds to which the cells and/or liver are being exposed. lastly, one cannot discount the potential involvement of other organ systems in the whole organism that are difficult to model with a single cell system. for example the toxicological activation of  <dig> -dinitrotoluene has been shown to be a multi-step process involving metabolism in the liver, excretion into the bile, deconjugation of metabolites and further metabolism by the intestinal flora, re-uptake  of metabolites into liver, and finally activation and binding to cellular macromolecules in the liver  <cit> . the absence of enrichment of functions related to metabolizing nitrogenous groups in  <dig> hr or  <dig> hr primary cells suggests that, at these time points, the hepatocyte cells reflect a limited range of the gene expression activities in liver tissue that respond to rdx.

CONCLUSIONS
we have compared the similarity in gene expression responses of an in vitro system, primary hepatocyte cells, to an in vivo system, rat liver tissue, to determine how faithfully primary cells reflect toxicological responses of liver tissue exposed to an energetic compound, rdx. primary cells were capable of expressing most genes present in liver tissue; however transcriptional level changes in primary cells reflected only a fraction of responses observed in liver tissue. this study indicates that care must be taken when toxicological data is derived from primary cells and extrapolated to whole animal organ toxicity effects.
