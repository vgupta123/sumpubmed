BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile  is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium currently responsible for virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis  and for 10-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea  <cit> . the organism is resistant to various antibiotics and capitalizes on the ensuing disruption of the normal intestinal flora to colonization and cause disease. the spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic carriage to a fulminant, relapsing, and increasingly fatal colitis  <cit> . the effects of c. difficile infection  are devastating, both in terms of morbidity and mortality and the high costs of disease management  <cit> . once regarded as relatively uncommon, there has been an upward trend in the incidence of cdi in both north america  <cit>  and europe  <cit>  culminating in  <dig> in over  <dig> times as many deaths  than mrsa  in england and wales  <cit> .

various reasons have been suggested for this extraordinary rise in incidence and mortality, including the emergence of so-called 'hypervirulent' strains. the most prominent such strains belong to pcr-ribotype  <dig>  responsible in north america for a 5-fold increase in the historical average of cdi, more severe disease, higher relapse rates, increased mortality, and greater resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics  <cit> . although restriction endonuclease analysis  and multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis  have greater powers of discrimination  <cit> , pcr-ribotyping  <cit> , represents the most widely used method of distinguishing strains, and relies on the use of specific primers complementary to the 3' end of the 16s rrna gene and to the 5' end of the 23s rrna gene to amplify the variable-length intergenic spacer region. the fragments generated are analysed electrophoretically, and the size distribution of fragments obtained compared to reference patterns. presently upwards of  <dig> pcr-ribotypes are recognised  <cit> .

typically, pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains  possess a binary toxin gene and encode a variant tcdc repressor protein suggested to account for increased toxin production  <cit> . current pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains have, since the first documented isolate  <cit> , acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone and erythromycin antibiotics  <cit> , and their occurrence is often associated with an excessive use of quinolone antibiotics. the speed with which pcr-ribotype  <dig> can become predominant is exemplified by events in the uk where its incidence increased from virtually zero over the period  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , to  <dig> % through the period  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig> % across england over the period april  <dig> to march  <dig>  <cit> . however, whilst pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains have received much attention, other strains may also present an equivalent threat in terms of disease severity. in many countries, different pcr-ribotypes can predominate, but be extremely rare elsewhere. for instance, the pcr-ribotype  <dig>  although common in the uk  <cit> , was entirely absent from the european study of barbut et al.  <cit> . in the netherlands, pcr-ribotype  <dig> increased from 3% to 13% over the period february  <dig> to february  <dig>  infected younger individuals than pcr-ribotype  <dig> and was more frequently involved in community-associated disease  <cit> . human pcr-ribotype  <dig> isolates possess a number of features in common with pcr-ribotype  <dig> and have recently been shown to be genetically related to isolates from pigs  <cit> .

currently, the overall reason why particular strains achieve epidemic status is unclear. although some suggestions have been made  <cit> , in terms of altered toxin production, presence of binary toxin, changes in antibiotic susceptibility and sporeogenesis, the situation is likely to be more complex involving a number of different phenotypic traits. a previous comparative phylogenomic study using microarrays based only on those genes present in the annotated genome sequence of a pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain, cd <dig>  <cit>  ), showed that the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains tested formed a tight clade, which was distinct from the other  <dig> strains analyzed and confirmed the clonal nature of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, but indicated extensive variation in the genetic content  <cit> . a further study microarray study included extra genes from the canadian pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain, qcd-32g <dig>  <cit>  ) where the conserved genetic core was defined and divergent regions were conserved amongst strains of the same host origin.

the aim of this current study was to identify unique strain differences using a genome wide approach, with a view to both gaining greater insight into enhanced virulence and as a means of identifying regions of sequence divergence suitable for use as diagnostic indicators of hypervirulence. to accomplish this, a dna microarray comprised of over  <dig> oligonucleotides was designed and constructed using in situ inkjet oligonucleotide synthesis. the strains represented included cd <dig>  r <dig> and qcd-32g <dig>  the strains subjected to comparative genomic hybridisation were chosen as they represented the most prevalent pcr-ribotypes from the uk and eu  <cit> . the work presented in this study represents the application of a novel microarray format to the study of comparative genomic hybridisation and is the only study that employs the widely used molecular typing technique of ribotyping to choose the strains for hybridisation and for subsequent clustering analysis.

RESULTS
array verification and coverage
forty thousand and ninety seven 60-mer probes were designed to cover the sequenced and annotated genome of c. difficile cd <dig>  this essentially corresponded to a probe every approximately  <dig> bp. a further  <dig> probes were designed to extra genes in the preliminary  <dig> sequence produced for r <dig> by the sanger in  <dig> and the available unannotated qcd-32g <dig> sequence. additionally,  <dig> extra genes including the toxin genes, cwp <dig> and slpa were represented at high density by  <dig> oligonucleotides. initial experiments were performed with a set of control strains that included cd <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and cd <dig> . a cd <dig> self-self hybridisation was also performed. analysis of the data obtained showed that the genome of strain cd <dig> hybridised to  <dig> of the '027-specific' probes; and a blastn in silico analysis of the array oligonucleotides against the cd <dig>  r <dig> and qcd-32g <dig> sequences used to design the array showed that these oligonucleotides had highly significant matches in these strains. accordingly, these oligonucleotides were excluded from further analysis.

analysis of the remaining pcr-ribotype  <dig> oligonucleotides with genomic dna of the control strains showed that these probes produced a positive signal with the dna of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains. figure  <dig> shows a condition tree clustering for all the strains against all of the probes, with those representing cd <dig> listed at the top, pcd <dig>  the extra genes and finally the extra pcr-ribotype  <dig> genes at the bottom. strains are grouped by pcr-ribotype and, on initial inspection, demonstrate that each pcr-ribotype exhibits a visually similar pattern of hybridisation. additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presents a full list of the probes that are present or absent in each strain.

core
the core gene list was established by examining cd <dig> probes present and at a 1: <dig> ratio for each strain. analysis of the core genes for all the strains tested showed that 32% of cd <dig> probes were conserved . this percentage is higher than those previously published in other array studies of  <dig> %  <cit>  and 16%  <cit> . this is perhaps surprising due to the wide variety of pcr-ribotypes analysed but as this array is denser, containing more than one reporter element per gene, greater sequence conservation will be evident than for arrays with one reporter per gene. therefore, genes such as slpa which may not be included in the previously reported core percentages would be represented in this current figure. our array also covers intergenic regions not covered by lower density microarrays. conservation of genes was seen amongst all functional categories . even greater conservation was seen when comparing strains of the same pcr-ribotype and table  <dig> indicates the percentage conservation amongst the studied pcr-ribotypes, with a conservation of 85% or more for pcr-ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

*indicates only one reference strain tested.

mobile elements
c. difficile is known to have a highly mosaic genome with many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative transposons and prophages  <cit> . of the  <dig> probes representing mobile or extrachromosomal elements in strain cd <dig>  only  <dig> probes were present in the core of all the strains hybridised. additional file  <dig> summarises the presence of the known cd <dig> mobile elements in each pcr-ribotype. in the majority of pcr-ribotype  <dig> and  <dig> strains, ctn <dig> is absent or highly divergent. it is absent or highly divergent in all pcr-ribotype  <dig> and  <dig> strains. ctn <dig> is absent from all of the pcr-ribotypes except from the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, cd <dig> and ecdc  <dig>  ctn <dig> is absent or highly divergent from all pcr-ribotypes except  <dig> and  <dig>  ctn <dig> or tn <dig> is the only known mobile c. difficile element containing erythromycin and tetracycline resistance  <cit> . therefore resistance to these antibiotic classes in any of the strains tested, including r <dig> and pcr-ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> strains  must be provided by an as yet undefined genetic element or mutation  <cit> .

ctn <dig> is detectable in the pcr-ribotype  <dig> quebec strain 23m <dig> but is absent or highly divergent in 27/ <dig> of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains tested on the array utilised in this study. it is also partially present in one of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains tested but absent from all the other pcr-ribotypes. ctn <dig> is absent or highly divergent in  <dig> pcr-ribotypes;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  in all pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains only genes cd1864- <dig> are absent or highly divergent. these genes are also absent or highly divergent in 1- <dig> strains of the remaining  <dig> pcr-ribotypes;  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  one pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain exhibits hybridisation between cd3330- <dig>  but ctn <dig> is absent or highly divergent in all the other strains tested. conversely ctn <dig> is present in some form in all pcr-ribotypes except pcr-ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  prophage  <dig> is absent from all the strains tested except the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains. prophage  <dig> hybridises between cd2927- <dig> in all but pcr-ribotype  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains.

virulence genes
various genetic loci that have been implicated in the virulence and pathogenesis of c. difficile, including those encoding for toxins and putative adhesions, as well as factors responsible for the spread of c. difficile, such as flagella and motility genes, antibiotic resistance and regulatory genes.

toxins
the c. difficile genome contains the paloc  which harbours five genes  responsible for the synthesis and regulation of the two major virulence factors, toxins, tcda and tcdb. variation in this region is extensive and as a consequence toxinotyping is a frequently used molecular method used to discriminate between strains  <cit> . variable sequences include both the structural genes encoding the toxins, and the associated regulatory genes. thus, the ability of some pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains to produce more of both toxins is attributed to a deletion at position  <dig> in the negative regulator of toxin production, tcdc  <cit> , leading to a truncated tcdc protein. the occurrence of similar deletions in other strains not generally associated with epidemics suggests, however, that such changes are not indicative of hypervirulence  <cit> . pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains are usually toxinotype iii strains, whereas cd <dig> is toxinotype  <dig> 

the array results confirm that tcdb is conserved among all pcr-ribotype  <dig> isolates examined and diverged in the 3' region of tcdc  as indicated by a lack of hybridisation to exp_cd630_800001_805000_s_pso-60- <dig>  the last tcdc probe on the array. naturally occurring toxin a-b+ strains cause diarrhoea and colitis in humans  <cit>  and are generally pcr-ribotype  <dig> . from the observed hybridisation obtained with our array, all of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains examined here lacked tcda and exhibited divergence in tcdb when compared to the corresponding cd <dig> and sm probes .

some c. difficile strains also produce a third toxin in addition to tcda and tcdb, a binary adp-ribosyltransferase toxin encoded by cdta and cdtb. the role of binary toxin in pathogenesis is unclear, although it has been linked to increased disease severity  <cit> . the genes cdta and cdtb are conserved in pcr-ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  our hybridisation results agree with those previously reported for cd <dig>  showing divergence in both of these genes which cause these genes not to be active in this strain  <cit> . pcr-ribotype  <dig> also displays similar results to previous publications and, shows limited hybridisation to some cd <dig> cdta and cdtb reporters as concluded by rupnik  <cit> . the results from this study for the other pcr-ribotypes examined show that this region is divergent.

flagella and motility genes
flagella are important in pathogenesis for many enteric pathogens including campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enterica serovar enteridis  <cit> . chemotaxis and motility are inextricably linked and both are important for bacterial survival allowing the bacteria to move towards nutrients and away from substances that may prove detrimental.

genes that allow for flagella modification by glycosylation have recently been described in c. difficile qcd-32g <dig> and r <dig> upstream of the flagellar biosynthesis locus  <cit> . reporters representing  <dig> of the  <dig> loci  are present on the array and are conserved in all strains but two pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains . stabler et al  <cit>  described the flagella related genes in  <dig> loci of the cd <dig> genome, f1; cd0226- <dig> and f3; cd0245- <dig>  <cit> . loss of, or significant divergence in the f <dig> and inter-flagella region  was observed in pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains; this was shown to be due to 84-90% sequence identity in this region  <cit> .

our data shows that only 7/ <dig> strains are divergent in these genes and this includes the two pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains discussed above, two non-toxigenic strains and two pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains. pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains have previously been reported to be non-motile  <cit>  and although the cd <dig> flagella loci appears to be highly divergent or absent in these stains, the corresponding r <dig> flagella and flagella glycosylation genes are present, indicating that another mechanism of variation is responsible for their non-motility.

antibiotic resistance
another contributing factor to the spread of c. difficile infection is the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. the genome sequence of cd <dig> allowed the identification of many genes associated with antibiotic resistance, including those already known such as ermb and tetm, and those with no prior experimental data, such as the putative lantibiotic antibiotic resistance genes . in contrast to strain cd <dig>  the epidemic  <dig> strains have been shown to be highly resistant to fluoroquinolones due to point mutations in the dna gyrase genes which cannot be detected by this microarray  <cit> .

in agreement with previous array data, the lantibiotic resistance loci, cd0643- <dig> and cd01349- <dig> are absent or highly divergent in all the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains tested and appear to be divergent in some of the tested pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains. the putative abc transporter that confers daunorubicin resistance  was absent from pcr-ribotype  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, but present in all others. the r <dig> sequence showed that chloramphenicol resistance was conferred by cdr <dig>  part of the ctn <dig>  the array shows that this gene or its homologue is present in all of our pcr-ribotype  <dig> and  <dig> strains, present in the majority of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains and divergent in the remaining pcr-ribotype strains.

regulatory systems
regulatory genes form a large part of the c. difficile genome comprising 11% of the cd <dig> genome  <cit> . in staphylococcus aureus, the agr quorum sensing locus  has been implicated as a key regulator of many virulence factors  <cit> . in strain cd <dig> only homologues of agrd and agrb were present, respectively encoding a prepeptide of a secreted small autoinducer peptide and a transmembrane protein involved in agrd processing. the homologous system in s. aureus also contains two further genes; agrc and agra encoding a two-coponent system. preliminary  <dig> sequencing of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> had shown that r <dig> contained a second complete copy of an agr locus  in addition to the agrbd genes of strain cd <dig>  accordingly, oligonucleotides corresponding to this extra agrcabd locus was incorporated on our array at high density with an additional  <dig> probes.

hybridisation against our array demonstrated that the extra agrcabd locus found in r <dig> is entirely present in the genomes of  <dig> of the  <dig>  strains tested, including two of four non-toxigenic strains . additional file  <dig> details the presence, absence and divergence  for each probe in the remaining  <dig> strains. the hybridisation to a few probes by dna isolated from each of these  <dig> strain implies that this region is divergent rather than absent. pcr primer walking was performed on the strains detailed in additional file  <dig> and primers were designed to the region cdr3184- <dig>  these primers generated amplicons of the expected size when dna was derived from the positive control, r <dig>  no such amplicons were generated when dna was derived from the  <dig> test strains. the positive control primers designed to amplify cdr <dig> produced an amplicon with dna isolated from all strains . overall, these results indicate that the absence of this additional agrcabd locus is the exception, rather than the rule.

other virulence factors
the ability to sporulate is an important mechanism for the dissemination of all clostridia. a recent study has suggested that epidemic pcr-ribotype  <dig> isolates are more prolific in terms of spore formation than non-epidemic strains  <cit> . the sporulation related genes represented on the array are conserved throughout all the strains tested.

another set of genes that have been implicated in virulence are those encoding cell surface proteins, including cwp <dig>  <cit> . the majority of the genes coding for cell surface proteins are conserved in all of the strains tested. the genes which appear to show divergence are cwp <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> 

non toxigenic strains
in order to provide further validation of the array, the dna of a total of four non-toxigenic strains , atcc baa- <dig>  and atcc  <dig> ), were hybridised to the array. braun et al  <cit>  defined the integration site for the pathogenicity locus  by the sequence-based comparison of toxigenic strains and non-toxinogenic strains. included in this analysis were the three atcc non-toxigenic strains  <dig>   <dig> and baa- <dig>  the c. difficile strain cd <dig> has previously been described as non-toxigenic but the nature of the deletion never fully characterised  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the paloc is absent from all four non-toxigenic strains at the site determined by braun et al  <cit> . in these strains, the cdu <dig> gene is adjacent to the cdd <dig> gene and this was confirmed using the multiplex pcr and primers described by braun et al.,  <cit>  .

further analysis of the non-toxigenic strains was performed and showed that  <dig> genes were absent or highly divergent from all of these strains compared to cd <dig> and  <dig> of the r <dig> extra genes were also absent or highly divergent . these genes include coding sequences  in the conjugative transposons ctn <dig> and ctn <dig>  two of the strains have additionally lost, or are highly divergent in, the flagella genes cd0226- <dig> and the r <dig> flagella f <dig> region cdr0242- <dig> 

discussion
the microarray used in the current study was designed to cover one sequenced strain of c. difficile , and the preliminary unannotated sequence from two different pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, r <dig>  and qcd-32g <dig>  since the microarray was designed in  <dig>  the fully annotated sequence of r <dig> , together with the historical pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain cd <dig> , has been published  <cit> . comparison of the 027-specific probes on the microarray to the published sequence of r <dig> has revealed some differences. in particular, a total of  <dig> additional r <dig> genes were described in comparison to the sequenced strain cd <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be unique to cd <dig>  the array used in our study covers  <dig> of the  <dig> additional genes . the missing cds are detailed in table  <dig>  the majority of genes not represented on the array are transposon or phage related  and the remaining  <dig> genes have oligonucleotide reporters representing neighbouring genes on the array.

during the gap closure sequencing and subsequent analysis of the r <dig> and cd <dig> genomes,  <dig> extra genes were found in strain r <dig> compared to the historical strain cd <dig>  this included a unique  <dig> kb phage island, termed smpi <dig> which was found to be inserted into a unique pcr-ribotype  <dig> conjugative transposon, named ctn <dig>  our array was designed prior to gap closure of these  <dig> genomes and as a consequence represents only  <dig> % of the  <dig> additional genes found in the r <dig> genome. the majority of the genes not represented by the array form part of the conjugative transposon, ctn <dig>  which is unique to r <dig>  however, the  <dig> ctn <dig> genes that are represented by our array were found to be present in the genomes of only  <dig> of the  <dig> pcr-riboytpe  <dig> strains tested, thereby indicating that this transposon is not common amongst pcr-riboytpe  <dig> strains.

the tiling nature of our array has established a more stringent and definitive core gene or sequence list than those previously published. analysis of the core genes for all the strains tested showed that 32% of cd <dig> probes were conserved . this percentage is higher than those previously published in other array studies of  <dig> %  <cit>  and 16%  <cit> . the high density of our array, the fact that there is more than one reporter per gene and the coverage of intergenic regions means that our array provides a greater ability to define the core genes or sequences in each strain than pcr-spotted or single reporter per gene arrays. conservation of genes was seen amongst all functional categories .

as expected even greater conservation was seen when comparing strains of the same pcr-ribotype. table  <dig> indicates the percentage conservation amongst the studied pcr-ribotypes, with conservation of 85% or more for pcr-ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in comparison to strain cd <dig>  however, three of these ribotypes were only represented by one isolate and the study would have to be extended to include more isolates to provide a real indication of conservation among ribotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  our array confirmed divergence between strains within the toxin encoding regions between pcr-ribotypes, particularly in the case of tcdb and cdtab, while at the same time demonstrated that the particular tcdb variant present in r <dig> was conserved amongst all pcr-ribotype  <dig> isolates tested.

examination of the conjugative transposons in different pcr-ribotypes of c. difficile shows that the pattern of hybridisation to the probes representing the mobile elements provides only a limited indication of pcr-ribotype. thus, while the majority of pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains lack any sequences homologous to ctn <dig>  one strain  does carry ctn5-derived sequences. many strains showed homology to the genes at the terminal ends of the transposons. whilst this could be because these genes are common to many transposons, genes such as cd <dig> and cd <dig> of ctn <dig> are present in all the strains tested even though the occurrence of the whole tranposon is limited to cd <dig> and one pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain. the two single pcr-ribotype  <dig> and  <dig>  and the eight pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains appear particularly devoid of homology to the specific transposons and prophages probes present on the array. the elements tested appear completely absent from six of the eight pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, as well as the single pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain , and pcr-ribotype  <dig> strain . two of the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains carry some regions with limited homology to parts of prophage  <dig> 

a major aim of the study was to determine whether it was possible to identify divergent sequences that may be characteristic of either pcr-ribotype  <dig>  or indeed hypervirulence. seventeen of the  <dig> pcr-ribotype  <dig> probes represented on the microarray were present in all of the strains . in silico analysis showed that these matches were not expected against the available non- <dig> nucleotide sequences. determination of hypervirulent sequence markers to separate pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains from the rest of the strains was not possible. all of the  <dig> genes represented by the  <dig> probes were present in at least one strain of pcr-ribotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig> details the percentage of  <dig> probes present in each pcr-ribotype. additional file  <dig> details the  <dig> genes discovered by stabler et al  <cit>  absent from the array design. additional file  <dig> examines the probes absent in each pcr-ribotype. filtering was performed to see if any elements on the array could be used to identify individual pcr-ribotypes. no single probe was representative of just one pcr-ribotype.

*indicates only one reference strain tested

it was noteworthy that the pcr-ribotype  <dig> reference strain also shares the extra pcr-ribotype  <dig> genes. pcr-ribotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are very difficult to differentiate by pcr-ribotyping and, therefore, frequently combined as "014/ <dig> type". this 014/ <dig> pcr-ribotype is currently the most frequently found type in europe. it is remarkable, however, that type  <dig> differed considerably from  <dig> by the presence of extra  <dig> genes, indicating that the reference pcr-ribotype strains of  <dig> and  <dig> are clearly different. as only one reference strain of pcr-ribotype  <dig> was examined on the array, the possibility that these  <dig> pcr-ribotypes may be distinguishable by the presence or absence of the extra  <dig> genes needs to be further examined. our study further emphasised that the extra copy of the agr system  present in r <dig>  <cit> , and absent in cd <dig>  is present in the majority of strains examined. it is, therefore, most likely not associated with hypervirulence.

another aim of this study was to determine sequences that could be used to identify the strain cd <dig>  the pcd <dig> plasmid is only present in one other strain . as detailed in table  <dig>   <dig> cd <dig> genes are absent, or highly divergent, from all other pcr-ribotypes . only the mobile elements ctn <dig> and ctn <dig> do not have any cds on this list. the only genes which are not derived from mobile elements on this list are cd0211- <dig>  which encode a ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and a putative choline sulfatase, and cd <dig>  cd2003- <dig>  encoding  <dig> conserved hypothetical proteins, an efflux pump and a marr transcriptional regulator. cd3136- <dig> and 3147- <dig> are included in this list as they are only present in  <dig> of the  <dig> strains tested.

CONCLUSIONS
c. difficile has become the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in recent years, partly due to the emergence and spread of the hypervirulent pcr-ribotype  <dig>  the increasing rates of cdi are not only caused by the spread of this pcr-ribotype, which remains the second most commonly isolated pcr-ribotype in the uk and the fourth most commonly isolated pcr-ribotype in europe  <cit> .

this array comparative genomic study presents a snapshot of current eu clinical strains and the current molecular epidemiology of c. difficile  <cit> . our study has shown that the pcr-ribotype  <dig> markers absent in the cd <dig> genome are not solely confined to pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains, but appear distributed amongst other pcr-ribotypes to varying degrees. indeed, in some cases  there is greater overall carriage of these markers  than amongst the pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains examined . the apparent lower carriage rate in the latter may in part be a reflection of the larger sample size analysed  compared to the other pcr-ribotypes . this does not rule out the possibility that some of these markers may be indicative of increased virulence. thus, pcr-ribotype  <dig> is one of the commonest types in europe, and frequently associated with outbreaks, pcr-ribotype  <dig> was until recently the epidemic strain in england and wales  <cit> , whilst pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains are increasing recognised as being as equally aggressive as pcr-ribotype  <dig> strains  <cit> . the presence of markers of enhanced virulence common to  <dig> would, is, therefore, not surprising.

although comprehensive and of high density, the microarray employed here is of limited utility value as it does not cover all the extra pcr-ribotype  <dig> genes later revealed by stabler et al.  <cit> . the presence of such '027-specific'genes in the pcr-ribotype  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> should be confirmed. however, as they largely represent transposon-related genes, their usefulness as markers of hypervirulence for diagnostics may be limited.

we have fulfilled the aims of this study by identifying markers for cd <dig> and markers for hypervirluence, albeit genes that are not just indicative of pcr-ribotype  <dig>  as a consequence of our comprehensive array coverage, we have also defined a more stringent core gene set compared to those previously published  <cit> . further to this, we have defined a list of genes absent from non-toxinogenic strains and defined the deletion in strain cd <dig>
