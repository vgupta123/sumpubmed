BACKGROUND
inhalational anthrax commences with the deposition of bacillus anthracis spores into the bronchioalveolar spaces of the lungs, and culminates with the systemic dissemination of vegetative bacilli within the host  <cit> . within the lungs, internalization of dormant spores, possibly by several different types of host cells, is believed to be a key step for initiating the transition from the localized to disseminated stages of infection. alveolar macrophages are reported to transport spores out of the lungs to regional lymph nodes  <cit> . dendritic cells have also been implicated in the rapid carriage of spores to the draining lymph nodes  <cit> . finally, alveolar epithelial cells have recently been demonstrated to internalize spores both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , and have been proposed to facilitate the transcytosis of b. anthracis across the epithelial barrier. taken together, these findings suggest that b. anthracis may escape the lungs by several distinct mechanisms.

to characterize the interaction of b. anthracis spores with host cells during the early stages of inhalational anthrax, in vitro models of infection have been widely implemented  <cit> . the tractability of in vitro models has facilitated new insights into the molecular and cellular basis of spore binding and uptake, as well as host cell responses. nonetheless, the use of in vitro models has resulted in a striking lack of consensus as to the responses and fates of both intracellular b. anthracis and infected cells. although there are multiple reports of germinated spores within host cells  <cit> , several studies have indicated that germinated spores ultimately kill macrophages  <cit> , while others have reported that macrophages readily kill intracellular b. anthracis  <cit> . the lack of consensus may be due, in part, to fundamental differences between the infection models used by research groups, which includes variability in bacterial strains, mammalian cells, and experimental conditions employed.

an important issue that is likely to directly influence the outcome of in vitro models of infection is the germination state of spores as they are internalized into host cells. several in vivo lines of evidence support the idea that spores remain dormant in the alveolar spaces of the lungs prior to uptake. first, dormant spores have been recovered from the lungs of animals several months after initial infection  <cit> . second, all spores collected from the bronchial alveolar fluids of spore-infected balb/c mice were found to be dormant  <cit> . in contrast, a substantial percentage of intracellular spores recovered from alveolar macrophages were germinated  <cit> . third, real time in vivo imaging failed to detect germinated spores within lungs, despite the effective delivery of dormant spores to these organs  <cit> . one of these studies  <cit>  reported that vegetative bacteria detected in the lungs during disseminated b. anthracis infection arrived at the lungs via the bloodstream, rather than originating from in situ spore growth. finally, using spores that had been engineered to emit a bioluminescent signal immediately after germination initiation, a recent study reported that germination was commenced in a mouse model of infection only after spore uptake into alveolar macrophages  <cit> . however, despite considerable evidence that the lung environment is not intrinsically germinating for b. anthracis spores, most in vitro infection models have been conducted using culture media containing fbs and/or specific l-amino acids or nucleotides at concentrations previously demonstrated to promote germination of spores in vitro  <cit> . under such conditions, it is likely that, in these previous studies, host cells were infected with heterogeneous populations of germinated and dormant spores.

the objective of this study was to experimentally address existing gaps in knowledge as to how the germination state of b. anthracis spores, as dictated by the presence or absence of serum during in vitro infections, influences the uptake of spores into mammalian cells, as well as the subsequent fate of both intracellular b. anthracis and infected cells. germinating and non-germinating culture conditions were used to compare the interaction of spores prepared from b. anthracis sterne  <dig> with raw <dig>  macrophage-like cells, as well as several other cell lines. these studies revealed that the uptake of b. anthracis into cells was largely unaffected by the germination state of spores. in contrast, the number of viable, intracellular b. anthracis recovered from infected cells, as well as the viability of the infected cells, was dependent on the germination state of spores during uptake. these results support the idea that the germination state of spores is an important consideration when interpreting results from in vitro infections with b. anthracis spores.

RESULTS
the composition of cell culture medium influences the germination and outgrowth of b. anthracis spores
several commonly used mammalian cell culture media, in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum , were first evaluated for the capacity to induce germination initiation, which is the earliest set of changes in dormant spores triggered by the presence of germinants. spore outgrowth, which is the transition of germinated spores into vegetative bacilli  <cit> , was also evaluated. these studies revealed that, regardless of the medium tested, dormant spores prepared from b. anthracis sterne  <dig>  underwent germination initiation when incubated at 37°c and under 5% co <dig> in the presence of fbs, as indicated by increased sensitivity of the spores to heat treatment  <cit>  and a time-dependent decrease in spore refractility, which indicates rehydration of the spore core following germination initiation  <cit>  . when incubated in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  plus 10% fbs, or, roswell park memorial institute   <dig> medium plus 10% fbs,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of total spores, respectively, converted from heat-resistant to heat sensitive forms within  <dig> min, while  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of total spores, respectively, converted to heat sensitive forms within  <dig> min, as determined by dilution plating and direct cfu counting over the course of three independent experiments. these results are consistent with a previous study reporting that approximately 98% of the b. anthracis sterne spores germinated within an hour when incubated in dmem plus 10% fbs  <cit> . another previous study reported that when incubated in minimal essential medium  supplemented with 10% fbs, approximately 37% of sterne spores germinated within one hour  <cit> . dose response studies revealed that germination initiation was induced in dmem containing 1% fbs, but not  <dig> % fbs . spore germination or outgrowth was not dependent on the commercial source of fbs, as similar results were obtained with fbs purchased from  <dig> different vendors . the capacity of spore preparations to germinate were confirmed by incubating dormant spores in the presence of the known germinants, l-alanine and l-inosine  ph  <dig> ) . in addition, the capacity of spore preparations to germinate and outgrow were confirmed by incubating dormant spores in the presence of luria-bertani broth  , as previously reported  <cit> . the time dependent increase in culture density  and morphological conversion of spores into elongated bacilli  indicated that in medium containing fbs, there was outgrowth of spores into vegetative bacilli.

a three independent experiments were performed with three different spore preparations, each conducted in triplicate.

b spores prepared from b. anthracis sterne  <dig> were incubated in the indicated medium.

c indicates the presence  or absence  of 10% fbs in the indicated medium.

d spores were scored positive  for germination if the od <dig> nm of the suspended spores decreased by more than 10% after  <dig> min incubation in the indicated medium.

e using dic microscopy, spores were scored positive  for outgrowth if the spores bodies were visibly larger at  <dig> h, and had developed into vegetative bacteria by  <dig> h.

f aa refers to l-alanine and l-inosine .

a three independent experiments were performed with three different spore preparations, each conducted in triplicate.

b spores prepared from b. anthracis sterne  <dig> were incubated in dmem.

c indicates the concentration of fbs used in the dmem.

d spores were scored positive  for germination if the od <dig> nm of the suspended spores decreased by more than 5% after  <dig> min incubation in the indicated medium.

e using dic microscopy, spores were scored positive  for outgrowth if the spores bodies were visibly larger at  <dig> h, and had developed into vegetative bacteria by  <dig> h.

in the absence of fbs, several media were discovered to induce germination initiation and outgrowth of b. anthracis spores . germination initiation  and outgrowth were detected when spores were incubated in brain heart infusion  broth , modified minimum essential medium alpha modification  , co2-independent media  , or mccoy's 5a  . each of these cell culture formulations contains all  <dig> amino acids, is enriched particularly in the known germinant l-alanine , and also contains non-specified nucleotides. notably, some nucleotides function as germinants  <cit> . in contrast, spores incubated in mem, dmem, rpmi  <dig> medium, advanced mem , eagle mem , basal medium eagle , or ham's f- <dig>  did not germinate, even after  <dig> h . each of these media possesses lower concentrations of l-alanine  than those media that induced germination, and generally lacked nucleotides. these results emphasize that care must be exercised when selecting a culture medium for conducting in vitro infections under non-germinating conditions.

effects of pre-conditioned culture medium on the germination state of b. anthracis spores
we next considered the possibility that cell culture media that normally do not promote spore germination may be converted to germinating media when incubated in the presence of mammalian cells. to evaluate this possibility, b. anthracis spores were incubated in dmem or rpmi that had been "pre-conditioned" in the presence of raw <dig>  cells or mh-s cells, respectively. these studies revealed that neither dmem nor rpmi, following a pre-conditioning period of  <dig> h, induced germination of b. anthracis spores . likewise, medium withdrawn from raw <dig>  cells infected for  <dig> or  <dig> h with dormant spores at a multiplicity of infection of  <dig>  also remained non-germinating . finally, medium withdrawn from raw <dig>  cells infected with dormant spores  contained only heat resistant b. anthracis, and no heat sensitive spores , indicating that the extracellular spores remained dormant through the first  <dig> hours of infection. when the pre-conditioning period was extended to  <dig> h, both dmem and rpmi induced germination, but negligible outgrowth, of spores . spore germination was eliminated by dialyzing  the  <dig> h preconditioned dmem or rpmi, but not by heat treatment , suggesting that the germinating factors were relatively small molecular weight, heat-resistant factors. nonetheless, these studies confirm that in vitro models can be established that maintain a non-germinating environment for at least the first  <dig> h of infection.

mammalian cells remain viable and functional for at least  <dig> h in fbs-free culture medium
although a non-germinating environment was maintained for at least  <dig> h in fbs-free media , it was unclear whether viable and functional cells could be maintained in fbs-free medium over this same time period. studies to evaluate this issue revealed that over a  <dig> h period, raw <dig>  cells in dmem demonstrated essentially identical viability , cell cycle progression , and metabolic activity  in the absence or presence of fbs . even after  <dig> h, the viability  and cell cycle profiles  were not significantly different for raw <dig>  cells cultured in the absence or presence of fbs. the metabolic activity of raw <dig>  cells increased after  <dig> h, but significantly more so in the presence than absence of fbs , which we speculate was due to greater overall proliferation and number of cells in fbs-enriched medium. these results confirmed that, for at least  <dig> h, in vitro models of infection can be conducted under entirely non-germinating culture conditions without loss of host cell viability, cell cycle progression, or metabolic function.

germination state of spores does not alter the uptake by mammalian cells
the demonstration that cultured raw <dig>  cells remained viable and functional in fbs-free cell culture medium did not directly address the possibility that spore uptake by mammalian cells might be substantially different under germinating and non-germinating cell culture conditions. to evaluate this issue, alexa fluor 488-labeled spores were incubated with raw <dig> , mh-s, or jawsii cells  in the absence or presence of fbs . after  <dig> or  <dig> min, intracellular spores were monitored using flow cytometry to measure cell associated fluorescence that was not sensitive to the membrane-impermeable, alexa fluor  <dig> quenching agent, trypan blue  <cit> . these studies revealed that for each cell line tested, neither the percentage of infected cells within the population , nor the overall increase in intracellular spores , was significantly different in the presence or the absence of fbs. collectively, these results revealed that the uptake of b. anthracis spores by mammalian cells is essentially the same within germinating and non-germinating in vitro environments.

germination state of spores influences the number of viable, intracellular b. anthracis
although the uptake of b. anthracis spores into mammalian cells was independent of the presence or absence of fbs in the culture medium, it was not clear whether the outcome of infection would also be similar under germinating and non-germinating conditions. to evaluate this issue, the recovery of viable, intracellular b. anthracis was compared subsequent to uptake by raw <dig>  cells in the absence or presence of fbs , using the gentamicin protection assay  <cit> . these studies indicated that there were not significant differences in intracellular cfu after  <dig> min post-infection . however, after  <dig> or  <dig> min post infection, significantly greater cfu were recovered from cells in dmem lacking fbs relative to cells incubated in the presence of fbs . to evaluate whether these differences might be attributed strictly to the presence or absence of fbs, similar studies were conducted in the absence of fbs, however this time using spores that had been pre-germinated for  <dig> min with dmem supplemented with l-alanine/l-inosine . similar to spore uptake in the presence of fbs, significantly fewer cfu were recovered from cells incubated with pre-germinated spores in the absence of fbs relative to cells incubated with dormant spores in dmem lacking fbs . these results support the idea that the germination state of spores, rather than the presence or absence of fbs, is an important determinant of the outcome of infection. similar results were obtained when studies were conducted with mh-s cells and jawsii cells . although the reasons underlying the greater recovery of spores from infections conducted under non-germinating conditions are not clear, we speculate that germinated spores might be more susceptible than dormant spores to killing after uptake from the cell surface. this potential explanation is consistent with earlier reports that spores that had been intentionally pre-germinated prior to exposure to mammalian cells were more readily killed than dormant spores upon uptake into mammalian cells  <cit> . these results support the idea that the germination state of b. anthracis spores is a critical determinant of the fate of the intracellular bacteria.

germination state of b. anthracis spores influences the viability of raw <dig>  cells during in vitro infection
the greater number of viable, intracellular b. anthracis recovered from cells infected under non-germinating conditions  prompted us to examine whether the viability of infected host cells might also be influenced by the germination state of spores during uptake. to evaluate this issue, raw <dig>  cells were incubated with b. anthracis spores  in the presence or absence of fbs . subsequent to employing the same gentamicin-protection procedure used for monitoring intracellular b. anthracis , pi uptake by raw <dig>  cells was measured at  <dig> min,  <dig> h, and  <dig> h, post-infection. these studies revealed that at  <dig> h post-infection, there was approximately 2-fold greater pi uptake, indicating a significantly greater loss in viability of raw <dig>  cells that had been incubated with spores in fbs-deficient medium, as compared to fbs-enriched medium . when evaluated at  <dig> h post-infection, pi uptake was nearly 5-fold greater in raw <dig>  cells that had been incubated with b. anthracis spores in fbs-deficient medium . understanding the reasons underlying these significant differences in the viability of infected cells will require future studies, but we speculate that the greater intracellular load of b. anthracis in cells infected under non-germinating conditions  may directly contribute to the higher degree of cell death.

the importance of culture medium during in vitro infection models
despite compelling evidence that during in vivo infection, the alveolar spaces of the lungs are intrinsically non-germinating, and dormant spores are taken up by mammalian cells prior to germination  <cit> , many studies involving in vitro models of infection have been conducted under germinating medium conditions  <cit> . most studies have been conducted in cell culture medium containing 2-10% fbs, including those using raw <dig>  cells  <cit> , and the germination state of spores have not generally monitored or controlled for during in vitro infections.

several in vitro models have employed additives to the culture medium in an attempt to modulate germination. several studies used d-alanine and/or d-histidine  <cit> , known inhibitors of germination initiation. however, interpretation of these studies may be complicated by the finding that d-alanine/d-histidine, when added subsequent to spore uptake into macrophages, alter the extent to which spores germinate  <cit> , suggesting that these d-amino acid germination inhibitors diffuse into host cells and affect spore germination within intracellular vesicles. horse serum has been used by several groups to limit spore outgrowth during infection  <cit> . however, 10% horse serum in dmem only slows, but does not eliminate the germination initiation of spores  <cit> . the finding that raw <dig>  cells maintain viability, cell cycle progression, and mitochondrial metabolic activity for at least  <dig> h when maintained in serum-free medium , indicate that in vitro infections, at least with raw <dig>  cells, can be conducted under non-germinating conditions using fbs-free medium.

the outcome of infection is influenced by the germination state of spores
both spore  and host cell  viability were influenced by the germination state of spores at the time of uptake. because several cell lines internalized the same number of spores under both germinating and non-germinating conditions , it is unlikely that differences in the outcome of infection are due solely to initial differences in spore load. rather, we speculate that, in contrast to dormant spores, germinated spores might be more vulnerable to growth inhibition and/or killing during phagocytosis. these results are consistent with previous reports that when infections were conducted with spores in medium containing fbs or fetal calf serum , there were generally, within the first 4- <dig> h post-infection, losses in intracellular cfu recovered from primary human dendritic cells  <cit> , primary mouse alveolar macrophages  <cit> , j <dig> a <dig> murine macrophage-like cells  <cit> , bone marrow derived macrophages from a/j mice  <cit> , or raw  <dig>  cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the infection of raw  <dig>  cells by b. anthracis spores is influenced by the germination state of spores, as dictated by the in vitro culture medium. the extent to which the germination state of b. anthracis spores ultimately affects the outcome of infections using cells other than raw <dig>  cells may ultimately depend on the properties idiosyncratic to that particular cell type or cell line. however, our results indicate the importance of rigorously considering the germinating properties of the culture medium when establishing in vitro models to study the infection of host cells with b. anthracis spores.
