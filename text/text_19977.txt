BACKGROUND
the detrimental effects of high ambient temperature on broiler performance have been extensively investigated  <cit> . several management protocols proposed to improve the thermotolerance acquisition in birds. thermal manipulation  at early and late stages of broiler embryogenesis is one of the most modern management model applied to improve the thermotolerance acquisition in broilers chickens . tm using several temperatures  for different durations  during the incubation period has been investigated . blood biochemistry such as serum concentrations of glucose, ions, proteins, thyroid hormones, some enzyme activities and corticosterone considered as useful biomarkers of stress response  <cit> . the alt and ck activities increased in heat stressed chickens compare to control  <cit>  whereas, serum total protein and albumin concentrations reduced in tm local chicks compare to control  <cit> . tm induced significant long-term effects on thyroid hormone metabolism by decrease the muscle mrna expression of dio <dig> and increase dio <dig> mrna expression in the liver  <cit> . furthermore, a significant increase in muscle mrna levels of hsp <dig> during embryogenesis and during tc in posthatch chicks has been reported  <cit> . however, the effect of tm during embryogenesis and subsequent tc at posthatch day  <dig> on biochemical parameters and mrna expression of stress related genes is not completely elucidated. in addition, the exact molecular and cellular bases for the improvement of the thermotolerance acquisition of the thermally manipulated chicks during thermal challenge are not fully understood.

therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate  the effect of tm at  <dig>  °c,  <dig> °c,  <dig>  °c and 40 °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during ed12– <dig> on selected biochemical parameters in plasma  and differential mrna expression of atrogin- <dig>  ck, avucp, dio <dig>  dio <dig> in muscles of broiler chickens  a tm chick’s ability to cope with tc at posthatch day  <dig> as reflected on the above mentioned biochemical parameters when compared with control birds.

methods
incubating and hatching management
all experimental procedures and management conditions used in this study were approved by the king faisal university animal care and use committee . one thousand and seven hundred fertile ross  <dig> broiler eggs obtained from one breeder flock  were incubated in semi-commercial incubators . one thousand and five hundred normal eggs selected for an initial weight 62 ± 2 g. the selected eggs were then divided into five incubation treatment groups : control group was maintained at  <dig>  °c 56 % relative humidity  throughout the incubation period; tm <dig> was subjected to tm at  <dig>  °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during ed12–18; tm <dig> was subjected to tm at 39 °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during ed12–18; tm <dig> was subjected to tm at  <dig>  °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during ed12– <dig> and tm <dig> was subjected to tm at 40 °c for 18 h and 65 % rh daily during ed12– <dig>  at hatching, chicks were distributed in floor pens at 32 °c and the temperature was gradually decreased to 21 °c at day  <dig> and maintained at 21 °c until day  <dig>  water and feed supplied to the chicks ad libitum. after feather drying, the one-day old chicks transferred to veterinary research station, king faisal university, saudi arabia for conduction of the field experiment.

thermal manipulation and heat challenge
chicks from each treatment group divided randomly into two sub-treatment groups, thermo-neutral  and thermally challenged . at post hatched day  <dig>  forty chicks, randomly selected from the tc group were thermally challenged by adjusting room temperature to 42 °c for 6 h, respectively. tn chicks kept under regular condition  in a separated room. at the beginning  and after  <dig>   <dig> and 5 h of tc, whole blood was drawn from the wing  vein from  <dig> chicks per treatment group and placed in an edta containing tubes. identical samplings and measurements also conducted using the tn chicks as control. the harvested plasma were used for determination of free and bound thyroid hormones , corticosterone, selected enzyme activities , protein pattern  and electrolytes concentrations .

biochemical analysis of samples
plasma was isolated by centrifugation of whole blood samples at  <dig>  g for 10 min. isolated plasma samples were then stored at −20 °c until further analysis. commercial elisa kits of biocheck, foster city, ca, usa were used for determination of total t <dig> , free t <dig> , total t <dig> , free t <dig>  and corticosterone on elisa reader . the results calculated according to the manufacturer’s instruction. in addition, commercial kits of reactvos biolab, spain were used for determination of calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and chloride on easylyte plus analyser . the commercial kits of arab company for medical diagnostics , jordan, were used for determination of the concentrations of total proteins and albumin and activities of alp and ck whereas commercial diagnostic kits of biosystem, spain were used for estimation of alt and ast activities on chemistry analyser and the results were calculated according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

discussion
the importance of thyroid gland hormones in adaptation to heat stress is related to the central role that thyroid hormones play in the regulation of metabolic rate of birds  <cit> . this effect has been demonstrated by thyroid hormone administration, which stimulates heat production  <cit>  and by surgical or chemical thyroidectomy of chicken, which produces a decrease in metabolic rate and body temperature  <cit> . the current findings indicated that tm during embryogenesis was able to affect the thermoregulatory events of broiler chickens, which resulted in a lowered free t <dig> in tm chicks compared with control. in addition, tc at posthatch day  <dig> reduced free t <dig> in tm and control birds. it is well known that, the epigenetic heat adaptation involves changes in blood contents, hormonal and metabolic reaction that enhances heat endurance  <cit> . parallel to the current findings, the concentration of t <dig> reduced in heat acclimation treated than control broilers  <cit> . in consistent with the present study, tc  caused a reduction in t <dig> level in tc chicks compared with tn chicks  <cit> . the current finding indicated that tc at posthatch day  <dig> increased t <dig> level in tc chicks compared with tn chicks. this finding come in accordance with the previous results  <cit>  which demonstrated that, tc  caused an increase in t <dig> level in tm chicks compared with tn chicks. the current findings also indicate that, tm at ed  induced significant reduction in t <dig> level without changes in t <dig> level in tm birds compare to control. this finding agrees with previous report  <cit>  with regard to t <dig> 

tm resulted in significant increases in plasma total proteins and albumin of tm chicks compared to control chicks. although, tc at posthatch day  <dig> induced a significant reduction of both plasma total proteins and albumin concentrations in tm and control birds, the concentrations of these proteins in tm birds were still higher than that of control. this evidenced that, tm modulates the thermoregulation process during embryogenesis and posthatching stages. previously, significant reduction in plasma total protein and albumin was observed when embryos were exposed to high incubation temperature than the control  <cit> . in addition, it is well known that, heat stress leads to delay the synthesis of most proteins except heat shock proteins  <cit> . serum total protein and albumin concentrations were significantly decreased in one day hatched local egyptian chicks subjected to tm  compared to control  <cit> . as reported in the current study, the increment of total proteins and albumin concentrations in tm birds can considered as a sort of protection of muscle mass against injury induced by tc.

publications about the effect of heat stress on enzymes activities are contradictory, possibly due to the large variability of the enzymes  <cit> . the current findings indicated that, tm did not change the activities of examined enzymes activities throughout the experimental period. similarly, subsequent tc at posthatch day  <dig> did not affect the enzyme activities of tm and control birds. according to the obtained results, heat exposure did not significantly change the enzyme activities in the chicken’s serum. this is supported by previous finding reported that, the activities of ck and ast were not influenced even by acute heat exposure  <cit> . the current findings suggest that virtually no cellular damage, resulting in leakage of intracellular enzymes into the blood, took place. therefore, the thermtolerance acquisition induced by tm was safe to the birds’ tissues.

publications concerning the effect of high ambient temperature on serum electrolytes status in chickens are contradicting. although, non-significant changes of all examined electrolytes have been observed in plasma of tm and subsequent tc at posthatch day  <dig> chicks in the current study, khone et al.  <cit>  reported increased blood potassium level in heat stress birds whereas, ait-boulahsen et al.  <cit>  noted otherwise. lin et al.  <cit>  reported that, chloride level was increased and potassium level was decreased by high temperature in birds. mcdaniel et al.  <cit>  reported a significant decrease of calcium and phosphorus levels in heat stressed birds. furthermore, zulkifli et al.  <cit>  reported that serum levels of sodium and chloride were significantly higher and serum potassium were significantly lower 14 days after heat exposure in broiler chickens.

dio <dig> acts as an outer-ring 5ʹ-deiodinase by removing iodine from the 5ʹ outer-ring site to convert t <dig> to the more active form t <dig>  while dio <dig> acts as an inner-ring deiodinase 5-deiodinase to remove iodine from the inner-ring of t <dig> and t <dig> and convert these hormones to inactive forms including reverse triiodothyronine  and diiodothyronine   <cit> . the current data indicated that, tm induced a significant down-regulation of dio <dig> and significant up-regulation of gene expression of dio <dig> in muscle of tm chicks compared to control. furthermore, tc at posthatch day  <dig> induced up-regulation of dio <dig> and down-regulation of dio <dig> gene expression in tm chicks and in control birds however, this effect was higher in tm birds compare to control. the lower dio <dig> and higher dio <dig> expression in tm birds is consistent with the decrease in plasma t <dig> concentration reported in the current study and also with decrease of plasma t <dig> reported previously in birds and mammals  <cit>  and fast growing chickens  <cit> . the persistence of increase of dio <dig> and decrease of dio <dig> expression in tm birds than control during tc might explain why plasma t <dig> concentrations in tm birds were lower than that of control during tc. nevertheless, tm decreased o <dig> consumption of embryos, indicating a potentially lower metabolic rate in these animals  <cit> . the current study showed that, mrna expression of dio <dig> significantly increased while that of dio <dig> significantly decreased in muscle of tm birds. these findings suggest that tm has a long-term overall negative effect on thyroid hormone metabolism in muscle. however, the physiological impact of such changes remains to be determined, since the activity of deiodinase enzymes is not necessarily correlated with their mrna expression.

atrogin- <dig> an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase also referred to as mafbx , plays a vital role in muscle atrophy  <cit> . atrogin- <dig> expressed only in skeletal muscle. its expression increased in catabolic conditions that result in muscle atrophy  <cit> . the current results indicated that, tm induced a significant down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> compared to the control. moreover, tc at posthatch day  <dig> induced up-regulation of gene expression of this gene in muscle of tm and control chicks. however, the up-regulation of atrogin- <dig> expression in muscle of tm birds was lower than that of control. these findings indicated that, all tested tm protocols decrease the effect of muscle degeneration and this is consistent with non-significant changes that observed in enzymes activities of ck. in response to tc, atrogin- <dig> was up regulated and this dynamic profile is consistent with previous reports of muscle injury response, whereby the expression of atrogin- <dig> was concomitant with atrophy and recovery  <cit> . atrogin- <dig> regulated by foxo transcription factors, via nuclear localization of foxo in response to various stimuli that inhibit pi3k/akt  signaling and subsequently drive atrophy  <cit> . the mechanism of down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> by tm could be furtherly investigated and studying the phosphorylation of akt/foxo axis might be of great benefits. as reported above, the increment of plasma total proteins and albumin concentrations together with down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> in muscle of tm birds are two mechanisms that perhaps induced by tm as a sort of protection of muscle mass against possible atrophy induced by tc. the current study demonstrated that tm and subsequent tc did not affect the gene expression of ckm and avucp in muscles of all investigated chicks. the current findings regarding the ckm are in consistent with the non-significant changes that observed in serum ck enzyme activities of all tc chicks. in addition, the down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> and elevation of total proteins confirmed these findings. the non-significant changes of avucp in muscle of all tc birds might give an indication that, the action taken by the body of birds subjected to tm was enough to counter act the thermal challenges.

in conclusion, the present study indicated that, tm improved thermotolerance acquisition by decreasing each of basal metabolic rate and muscle atrophy. the decrease in basal metabolic rate induced via reduction of t <dig> concentration in plasma with up and down regulation of dio <dig> and dio <dig>  respectively. however, the decrease in muscle atrophy conducted by stimulation of protein biosynthesis and down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our findings strongly indicated that, tm improved thermotolerance acquisition by decreasing basal metabolic rate and muscle injury during thermal stress. basal metabolic rate decreased via reduction of plasma t <dig> concentration with up and down regulation of expression of dio <dig> and dio <dig>  respectively in muscles. muscle injury protected by stimulation of protein biosynthesis and down-regulation of atrogin- <dig> expression.
