BACKGROUND
the largest family of suppressor of cytokine signalling  box-containing superfamily proteins are the ankyrin repeat and socs box proteins . although  <dig> members of the asb family have been identified in mice and humans, the function of asbs has not been clearly defined. the asbs have two functional domains, a socs box and a variable number of n-terminal ankyrin  repeats  <cit> . the socs box of asb proteins has two subdomains: a bc box and a cul2/cul <dig> box. highly conserved amino acid sequences of the bc box and the cul <dig> box, which are essential for ensuring that the interaction with elongins b/c and cullin 5-rbx <dig> forms e <dig> ubiquitin  ligase complexes, are important in a ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis pathway  <cit> . while socs family members use the sh <dig> domain to recruit substrates, the ank repeat regions of asb family members serve as specific protein-protein interaction platforms to recruit target substrates in different biological processes  <cit> . asb- <dig> targets the actin-binding proteins filaments a and b for proteasomal degradation. heuze et al. have shown that asb- <dig> may regulate haematopoietic cell differentiation by modulating the cell-spreading process  <cit> . ank repeats of asb- <dig> interact with the c-terminus of tumour necrosis factor -r <dig> and act as a negative regulator of the tnf-r2-mediated cellular response  <cit> . the ank repeat of asb- <dig> interacts with the factor-inhibiting hif1α ; it is also a hydroxylation substrate of fih and promotes vascular differentiation  <cit> . asb- <dig> reportedly regulates protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and alters the differentiation of mouse myoblast and the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and akt  <cit> .

creatine kinases  are a large family of isoenzymes involved in high-energy phosphate metabolism. five isoforms of ck have been identified in mammals: three in cytosol, namely ckb , ckm  and ckmb ; and two in mitochondria, namely ubiquitous mitochondrial ck  and sarcomeric mtck   <cit> . cks regulate levels of atp in subcellular compartments, where they provide atp molecules at sites of fluctuating energy demand of very specialised cells, such as muscle fibres, neurons, or sperm cells, by the transfer of phosphates between creatine and adenine nucleotides and immediate regeneration of atp. the cks are also necessary for maintaining the normal function of many other cells, including kidney, placenta, pancreas, thymus, thyroid, and intestinal epithelial cells, as well as endothelial cells, cartilage and bone cells, macrophages, and blood platelets, possibly by a continuous delivery of high-energy phosphates to the site of atp utilisation  <cit> .

abnormal expression and activity of cks have been shown in tumours and diseases  <cit> . the cytosolic ckb is induced in a variety of tumours, including neuroblastoma, small cell lung carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and breast carcinoma. because the tumour suppressor p <dig> is involved in the repression of ckb transcription, ckb may be increased in tumours with mutations in p <dig> alleles  <cit> . mtck is known as a primary target of oxidative and radical-induced molecular damage; and the impairment of mtck has been reported in ischaemia, cardiomyopathy, and neurodegenerative disorders  <cit> . upregulation of mtck has also been shown in creatine-depleted muscles and in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies, which may explain the mechanism of compensating for the functional impairment of the energy state control. overexpression of mtck in tumours has also been reported  <cit> . hence, cks and creatine analogues are considered a new target of chemotherapeutics for cancer.

a recent report shows that asb <dig> interacts with creatine kinase b ckb in human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cells, indicating that human asb- <dig>  mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ckb in cells  <cit> . asb <dig> was isolated as a potential biomarker for breast cancer  <cit> . in this study, we report that a variant of asb <dig> that lacks a socs box was naturally detected in human cell lines but not in human primary cells. we also demonstrate that asb <dig> interacts with umtck and induces malfunction of mitochondria, leading to negative regulation of cell growth.

RESULTS
identification of a variant form of asb <dig> in human cell lines
we used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  to analyse the expression pattern of  <dig> members of the asb family in human cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells . as shown in figure  <dig>  two bands of asb <dig> pcr products  were detected in human cell lines. however, hpbmc expressed only one band of asb <dig>  nucleotide sequence analysis of the two cdna bands shows that the shorter band represents the asb <dig> gene . interestingly, the longer pcr product represented a splicing variant of asb <dig> . we amplified cdna sequences that encoded full-length open reading frames of asb <dig> and the variant from hek <dig> cells by rt-pcr. when we deduced the amino acid sequences from the cdnas, we found the splicing variant encodes a smaller protein with a deletion of the socs box domain from asb <dig>  which we named asb9Δsocs . asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs have six ankyrin repeats.

to examine the tissue distribution of the asb <dig> expression, we performed real-time pcr analysis on cdnas prepared from human adult tissues. the asb <dig> mrna was expressed predominantly in the testes, kidney, and liver . the asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs expression was detected in human cell lines such as the leukaemia and hepatoma cell lines at the mrna and protein levels . interestingly, the asb9Δsocs expression was undetectable in the hpbmcs from diverse blood samples and human normal hepatocytes . however, a mouse asb- <dig> without socs box  was not detected in the mouse cell lines and tissues .

association of asb <dig> with cks and ubiquitin ligase complexes
because socs box-containing proteins associate with substrate proteins for degradation, immunocomplexing assays were performed to identify the asb <dig> interacting proteins . an anti-myc antibody was used to generate immunocomplexes from hek <dig> cells that stably express null, myc-tagged asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs proteins. the proteomic analysis suggests that the main protein associated with asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs is ckb. peptide fragments detected by mass spectroscopy show 27% sequence coverage of the total amino acids of ckb ; this result confirms that asb <dig> interacts with endogenous ckb in a socs box-independent manner. note also that asb <dig>  but not asb9Δsocs, coimmunoprecipitated with cullin  <dig>  elongin b and elongin c . this behaviour indicates that asb <dig> interacts with endogenous cullin  <dig> and elongin b/c through its socs box, which is consistent with a recent report  <cit> . additionally, we isolated another peptide sequence from umtck, even though the sequence contained only  <dig> amino acids and covered only 4% of the entire umtck sequence . importantly, the sequence corresponds to the c-terminal region  of umtck where the sequence shows only 27% identity with ckb .

the protein bands coimmunoprecipitated with human ankyrin repeat and suppressor of cytokine signalling  box protein   were digested in gel with trypsin, and the samples were analysed by electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry .

ckb = creatine kinase b; umtck = ubiquitous mitochondrial ck.

given that the isoforms of ck are highly homologous, we decided to check the ck-binding specificity of asb <dig> in the hek <dig> cells. first, the expression of endogenous ckb and umtck was identified by immunoblotting analysis. in contrast, the expression of ckm and smtck was not observed . next, the interaction specificity between asb <dig> and cks was determined by immunocomplexing assays. in hek <dig> cells that stably express myc-tagged asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs, endogenous ckb and umtck coimmunoprecipitated with asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs . in agreement with mass spectroscopy analysis , asb <dig>  but not asb9Δsocs, coimmunoprecipitated with elongin b. to further confirm endogenous interaction of these proteins, immunocomplexes were obtained using anti-asb <dig> antibody and cell lysates from two cell lines hek <dig> and huh- <dig> and analysed by immunoblotting . as expected, all of the proteins ckb, umtck and elongin b were identified in the immunoprotein complexes. others have previously shown interaction of asb <dig> with ckb  <cit> , but the interaction with umtck is a new finding. we therefore decided to check the interaction of asb <dig> with umtck in detail.

interaction of the ank repeats of asb <dig> with the substrate binding site of umtck
to clarify the interaction between asb <dig> and umtck, we used a coimmunocomplexing assay and mapped the regions of asb <dig> and umtck involved in the protein-protein interaction. to determine which region of asb <dig> is essential for binding to umtck, a series of myc-tagged asb <dig> deletion constructs that encode various numbers of ank repeat motifs was made  and cotransfected with haemagglutinin -tagged umtck constructs into hek <dig> cells. the coimmunocomplexing assay shows that asb <dig> interacted with umtck in a socs box-independent manner . however, the deletion of ank repeat  <dig>  abrogated its interaction with umtck . further deletion of the remaining ank repeats showed the same consequences as the deletion of the first ank repeat , suggesting that ank repeat  <dig> is essential for asb <dig> and umtck interactions.

cks are divided into three subdomains: a substrate binding site, an n-terminal catalytic domain, and a c-terminal catalytic domain. the substrate binding site is expected to recruit interacting proteins  <cit> . to determine whether the substrate binding site of umtck is essential for its interaction with asb <dig>  we constructed a ha-tagged substrate binding site  deletion mutant   and cotransfected it with myc-tagged asb <dig> constructs into hek <dig> cells . both asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs coimmunoprecipitated with umtck but not with umtckΔbs . these results indicate that the ank repeat domains of asb <dig> can associate with the substrate binding site of umtck in a socs box-independent manner.

the asb9-induced ubiquitination and degradation of umtck
because asb <dig> assembles with an ubiquitin ligase complex , ubiquitination of asb9-associated proteins  was evaluated by in vivo ubiquitination assays. when umtck and ubiquitin were introduced, high-molecular-weight bands representing the ubiquitination of the associated proteins were clearly detected in the asb9-expressing hek <dig> cells . the polyubiquitinated proteins accumulated in the presence of mg- <dig> . in contrast, significant ubiquitination of the asb9-interacting proteins was not observed in the cells that express asb9Δsocs, probably because asb9Δsocs can't assemble with an ub ligase complex .

to confirm asb9-dependent ck ubiquitination, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay . the lysates of null, myc-tagged asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-ckb  or anti-umtck antibodies , and the ubiquitination of ckb and umtck was monitored. polyubiquitination was not observed in the absence of ubiquitin. with ubiquitin, the polyubiquitination of ckb or umtck proteins was clearly detected in the presence of asb <dig>  and only weak polyubiquitination was seen in asb9Δsocs or the empty vector control, probably because of the endogenous asb <dig> activity . there were protein bands that migrate at a molecular weight less than ckb or umtck alone probably because of partial protein degradation. thus, the results strongly indicate that asb <dig> is involved in the recruitment, ubiquitination, and degradation of ckb and umtck through the socs box.

to investigate the long-term effect of asb <dig> expression in vivo, we analysed the expression of ckb and umtck after culture of stable cell lines for  <dig> passages. immunoblotting analysis with cell lysates and anti-myc immunoprecipitates reveal that the protein levels of endogenous ckb and umtck were dramatically reduced in the hek <dig> cells that stably express asb <dig> but not in asb9Δsocs . these results suggest that the ubiquitination and degradation by asb <dig> do affect the protein levels of target proteins in the cells.

colocalisation of asb <dig> and umtck in the mitochondria and influence of asb <dig> expression on the mitochondrial membrane potential
given that endogenous umtck can interact with asb <dig> , we evaluated whether asb <dig> colocalises with endogenous umtck in the mitochondria. the cellular localisation of protein was analysed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging. the expression of dsred2-mito was used as a mitochondrial marker. colocalisation of dsred2-mito and umtck in mitochondria was observed as expected . furthermore, asb <dig> was detected in the cytosol, which also includes mitochondria, though no asb <dig> was detected in the nucleus. moreover, umtck and either asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs colocalised in the mitochondria; this colocalisation is in agreement with the result of in vitro association of umtck with asb <dig> that occurs in a socs box-independent manner . interestingly, an abnormal mitochondrial structure was observed in the asb9-expressing hek <dig> cells . to investigate mitochondrial structure in the cells in detail, we compared the architecture of mitochondria with the aid of dsred2-mito and three-dimensional analysis of confocal data and found rounding and swelling of mitochondria in asb <dig> expressing cells . these results revealed that the asb <dig> interacts and colocalises with umtck in the mitochondria, leading to structural organisation defects, which occur in a socs box-dependent manner.

to directly investigate the correlation of asb9-induced change in the mitochondrial structure with mitochondrial function, we used tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester  to analyse the mitochondrial membrane potential . tmre is a highly fluorescent cationic lipophilic dye used to determine the value of ΔΨm based on the fluorescence intensity  <cit> . the membrane potential ΔΨm was detected in the control hek <dig> cells and shifted leftward in the presence of the uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide p- phenylhydrazone , indicating the depolarisation of ΔΨm . the ΔΨm in the cells that stably express asb <dig> was significantly lower than that of the control cells, which is similar to the membrane potential in the presence of the uncoupler, indicating the dissipation of ΔΨm in the asb <dig> expressing cells . in the asb9Δsocs expressing cells, the membrane potential was similar to that of the control cells . this result suggests that the ubiquitination and degradation of umtck in asb9-expressing cells is associated with a change in the mitochondrial structure and ΔΨm, which results in a significantly impaired mitochondrial function that may change a variety of cellular functions. to further confirm the correlation of asb <dig> expression and ΔΨm, we analysed ΔΨm in the pbmc, rpmi  <dig> cells and kg- <dig> cells . the ΔΨm in the pbmc  was significantly lower than that of the rpmi  <dig> cells and kg- <dig> cells. the dissipation of ΔΨm in the presence of the uncoupler was hardly detected in the pbmc. these results potentially support that the regulation of asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs expression may be a critical factor for the different capability of growth in primary cells and cell lines.

effect of asb <dig> on ck activity
the ckb in the cytosol and the umtck in the mitochondria interact with asb <dig> and are degraded by asb <dig> . thus, the correlation of ck activity with the asb <dig> expression was investigated in the hek <dig> cells that stably express asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs . the total cellular ck activity was reduced only in the hek <dig> cells that express asb <dig> but not asb9Δsocs. next, the ck activity was compared in the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions. the cytosolic and mitochondrial types of ck activity were both reduced in the asb9-expressing cells . however, there was no significant reduction in the ck activity in the cells that express asb9Δsocs. to confirm the correlation of ck activity with the asb <dig> expression, we analysed ck activity from human cell lines, pbmcs and normal hepatocytes. the total cellular, cytosolic and mitochondrial types of ck activity were significantly reduced in the pbmcs and normal hepatocytes that express asb <dig> but not asb9Δsocs . furthermore, the mitochondrial type of ck activity in the thp- <dig> and huh- <dig> cells  was lower than that of the other human cell lines . to confirm the activity of ckb and umtck more accurately, these proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ckb and anti-umtck, and the activity of the immunocomplexes was measured. as shown in figure 14c, asb <dig> clearly abolished the ck activity of ckb and umtck. the ck activity of umtck was also decreased in the presence of asb9Δsocs. these results imply that the association of asb9Δsocs with umtck may reduce the enzymatic activity even though umtck is not ubiquitinated and degraded. they also confirm that the involvement of asb <dig> in the creatine kinase system depends on the socs box.

effect of asb <dig> on cell growth
to investigate the correlation of asb <dig> with cell growth, we performed a 3-- <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide  assay on the hek <dig> cells that stably express asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs. the cell growth was markedly delayed in the cells that express asb <dig> but not asb9Δsocs . given that the mtt assay measures the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme activity  <cit> , we deduce from the results that asb <dig> is directly involved in the mitochondrial function and cell growth. additionally, we obtained the same results when we checked the cell growth by using the trypan blue exclusion method .

discussion
because asbs interact with a wide variety of target substrates via ankyrin repeat domains, they have diverse functions such as regulation of proliferation, differentiation, carcinogenesis, and regulation of the cell cycle. therefore, asbs may be differentially expressed between cell lines and primary cells. here, we evaluated expression and function of asb <dig> in detail. when investigating the expression of asbs, we detected a splicing variant of the asb <dig> that lacks a socs box  in several cell lines. recently, asb <dig> was reported to interact with ckb in hek <dig> cells, indicating that asb <dig> mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ckb in the cells. the investigators artificially deleted the socs box by using recombinant biotechnology and proved that the socs box of asb <dig> mediates interactions with the elongin b/elongin c/cullin  <dig> complex by functioning as an adaptor for an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex  <cit> . here, we noticed that asb9Δsocs is naturally present in human cell lines. interestingly, asb9Δsocs is not expressed in the pbmcs from diverse blood samples and normal hepatocytes . in the process of cell line establishment, chromosomal rearrangements, insertions, and/or deletions are commonly observed. given the importance of the socs box in asb <dig>  it is possible that induction of asb9Δsocs by genetic alterations may inhibit normal function of asb <dig> and have implications in the regulation of target proteins and cell growth. recently, asb <dig> was isolated as a potential biomarker for breast cancer  <cit> . it will be interesting to investigate whether the reported increase of asb <dig> expression is derived from upregulation of asb9Δsocs rather than asb <dig> in breast cancer cells.

on the basis of the proteomics approach, we confirmed that asb <dig> interacts with cks and ubiquitin ligase complexes in the hek <dig> cells that stably express myc-tagged asb <dig> . the peptides identified from the asb <dig> interacting proteins covered 27% and 4% of the entire ckb and umtck proteins, respectively . in this study, we identify for the first time that umtck is a new target of asb <dig>  in addition to ckb. because the co-operative involvement of cytosolic cks and mitochondrial cks is required for a functional phosphocreatine circuit  <cit> , it is ideal that asb <dig> recruits and regulates ckb in cytosol and umtck in mitochondria. according to the transfection and immunoprecipitation study, the ank repeat domains of asb <dig> can associate with the substrate binding site of umtck . this result is in agreement with previous reports on the binding properties of asbs and cks. furthermore, the expression of asb <dig> induces the ubiquitination of umtck and ckb in vivo and in vitro . as a result, the protein levels of umtck and ckb were clearly reduced after long-term culture for  <dig> passages .

given that asb <dig> interacts with umtck, we reasoned that the two proteins colocalise in the mitochondria. asb <dig> or asb9Δsocs colocalised with endogenous umtck in the mitochondria as expected . interestingly, the expression of asb <dig> induced an abnormal mitochondrial structure and loss of membrane potential. nowadays, the paradigm of the mitochondrial function is changing: mitochondria are considered not merely simple atp-generating organelles but complex integrators of cellular signalling pathways  <cit> . studies that use fluorescence staining in live cells to investigate the structure of mitochondria suggest that mitochondria are highly dynamic  <cit> . furthermore, mitochondrial alterations appear to be a factor in cancer  <cit> . therefore, the abnormal structure of mitochondria  and loss of ΔΨm  may be direct evidence that asb <dig> severely interrupts the normal function of mitochondria. previous studies by many investigators have shown that mtck proteins form an active octameric complex with an internal channel that stabilises the contact site between the outer membrane and the inner membrane and that this behaviour may be essential for the proper function  <cit> . moreover, under situations of a compromised cellular energy state, such as ischaemia, oxidative stress, and calcium overload, mtck seems to be a susceptible target for oxidation; compensatory upregulation of mtck gene expression has also been reported  <cit> . in addition, the downregulation of umtck by small interfering rna  in hacat and helas <dig> cells reportedly affects cell viability and mitochondrial morphology  <cit> . therefore, the targeting of asb <dig> to umtck is quite proper for efficient regulation of cell growth. the association with asb <dig> and degradation via ubiquitination may reduce the level of monomeric umtck as well as active oligomeric umtck and lead to an abnormal mitochondrial structure and function.

the expression of asb <dig> was correlated with the enzyme activity of the target substrates ckb and umtck . furthermore, the cellular ck activity of the total, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were all significantly reduced by asb <dig> but not by asb9Δsocs. when we measured the activity of ckb and umtck after immunoprecipitation with anti-ckb or anti-umtck, the results clearly show that the activity of ckb and umtck was abolished by asb <dig> and decreased by asb9Δsocs. the association of asb9Δsocs with umtck is likely to inhibit the enzymatic activity even though umtck is not ubiquitinated and degraded. the difference in the ck activity of cell lysates and immunoprecipitates may be derived from the residual adenylate kinase activity in the cell lysates. note also that the structure of the high-energy phosphate transfer system is reportedly rather complex because adenylate kinase can compensate for the decrease of ck activity when the action of cks is reduced  <cit> . the inhibition of ckb and umtck activity by asb <dig> is also linked to cell growth . however, as with the ck activity in cell lysates, asb9Δsocs did not show any significant inhibition of cell growth. therefore, the ck activity of cell lysates may represent the real state of the compromised cells that use a cellular buffer system, possibly adenylate kinases, to control the interruption by asb9Δsocs.

CONCLUSIONS
our results consistently show that asb <dig> targets umtck in addition to ckb for degradation, leading to negative regulation of the creatine kinase system and cell growth. co-operative inhibition of ckb and umtck in cytosol and mitochondria may be an efficacious strategy used by asb <dig> for the regulation of the cellular energy state. asb9Δsocs can associate with cks but cannot recruit the e <dig> ligase complex and ubiquitinate ckb and umtck. thus, asb9Δsocs is likely to be a negative regulator against the function of asb <dig>  perhaps the regulation of asb <dig> and asb9Δsocs expression will be an escaping strategy for cancer cells or established cell lines from the suppressive function of asb <dig>  because the physiological meaning of asb9Δsocs in human cell lines and cancer may give insights into cancer biology, further study on the function of asb9Δsocs is warranted.
