BACKGROUND
defects in mucus clearance are characteristic of muco-obstructive pulmonary diseases of genetic or environmental origins, e.g., cystic fibrosis , primary ciliary dyskinesia , and the chronic bronchitic  form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
 <cit> . airway mucus clearance is a multifactorial process, integrating epithelial mucin secretion and airway surface hydration with ciliary beat, cough, and/or gas–liquid pumping
 <cit> . while airway remodeling and inflammation often accompany defective mucus clearance
 <cit> , the mechanisms linking defective mucus clearance to obstructive lung disease are poorly understood. one paradigm is that defects in mucus clearance produce static mucus that provide a nidus for microbial colonization and resultant inflammatory responses
 <cit> . while this concept is supported by the presence of pathogens in lungs of patients exhibiting defects in mucus clearance
, the roles of the primary defects  in establishment of chronic inflammation are not fully appreciated. additional complexity arises when the consequences of mucus obstruction are considered in the context of normal lung development and aging, i.e., mucus obstruction early in life  may generate long-term effects that would not occur if the obstruction occurs later .

to model defective airway mucus clearance in vivo, transgenic mice over-expressing the epithelial sodium channel beta subunit  in airway club cells  were generated
 <cit> . the initiating pathophysiological defect in these mice, i.e., airway surface liquid  depletion, produces mucus dehydration, reduced mucus clearance, and overt pulmonary disease characterized by airway mucus obstruction, inflammation, and spontaneous bacterial infection
. at birth, the lungs of scnn1b transgenic  mice are histologically normal. during the early neonatal period, i.e., post-natal day  3– <dig>  significant tracheal mucus plugs develop that are associated with neonatal mortality and distal airway hypoxia
. transient necrotic degeneration of intrapulmonary club cells is also observed around pnd 3
 <cit> . macrophage activation, neutrophilia, and bacterial infection are detected as early as pnd 5
 <cit> . importantly, because murine lungs continue to mature during early post-natal life
 <cit> , the disease processes from pnd 3– <dig> are occurring during periods of active lung development, which has relevance for lung diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia  and early childhood exposures to toxic or infectious agents, i.e., smoke or viral infections, where inflammatory processes and development intersect to produce long-term, negative consequences for lung function
. after pnd  <dig>  mucus obstruction becomes more prominent in the main stem bronchi of the scnn1b-tg mice, airway inflammation becomes more modest, bacterial infection is intermittent, yet bronchoalveolar lavage  mucin content and mucin gene transcription remain elevated
 <cit> . further, alveolar air space enlargement becomes clearly evident, and the incidence of bronchus associated lymphoid tissue  increases
 <cit> .

pulmonary macrophages carry out important gate-keeping roles in host defense
 <cit> . as resident innate immune cells, they must remain quiescent in the healthy state, yet they must be able to respond when lung homeostasis is threatened. in health and disease, crosstalk occurs between the airway epithelium and macrophages via either receptor-mediated cellular interactions
 <cit>  or through humoral signals released by either cell types
 <cit> . the airway epithelium is the epicenter of disease initiation in the scnn1b-tg mice, and macrophages are strategically positioned to respond to defects in airway clearance. a consistent feature of disease in the scnn1b-tg mice is the presence of morphologically activated pulmonary macrophages
 <cit> . macrophages are morphologically activated early , and previous work identified up-regulation of genes associated with macrophage activation, including chitinases, il- <dig>  and other cytokines
 <cit> . macrophage-derived protease, mmp <dig>  is critical for the development of the emphysema in scnn1b-tg mice
 <cit> . germ-free scnn1b-tg mice exhibit lung pathology, including morphological activation of macrophages, very similar to scnn1b-tg mice raised in specific pathogen free  conditions, indicating that the macrophages respond directly to the primary defect of airway surface dehydration and mucus stasis
 <cit> .

genetic and pharmacologic studies suggest activation of multiple signaling pathways in response to defective mucus clearance in the scnn1b-tg mice. for example, genetic disruption of major pathways conventionally associated with airway inflammation and remodeling, e.g., myd <dig> and il-4rα, did not dramatically alter disease development
 <cit> , highlighting the need to explore additional disease-promoting pathways. in the present study, we hypothesized that disease-associated molecular signatures linked to key host response, e.g., airway inflammation and mucus cell metaplasia, could be identified by evaluating gene expression in selected tissues from scnn1b-tg mice at critical time points. accordingly, we selected the following time points: 1) immediately after birth , when the transgene is overexpressed but disease is not yet manifested histologically; 2) at pnd  <dig>  when tracheal mucus obstruction is prominent; 3) at pnd  <dig>  when chronic lower respiratory disease is being initiated; and 4) at pnd  <dig>  after establishment of chronic pulmonary disease. gene-level and pathways analyses were used to generate a picture of differential gene expression in whole lung and macrophages. the results highlight a highly dynamic interplay of tissue-specific and time-dependent responses and set the stage for future studies to explore these complex interactions.

methods
mice and animal husbandry
congenic c57bl/6n scnn1b-tg mice and wt littermates were maintained in a specific pathogen free  animal facility
 <cit> . germ-free  mice were maintained in the national gnotobiotic rodent resource center at unc
 <cit> . animals used in this study were maintained and studied under protocols approved by the university of north carolina institutional animal care and use committee.

lung rna isolation
tissues were collected from male mice at a designated time . the lung left lobe was removed by cutting the extrapulmonary bronchus at the level of the hilum. dissected tissue was stored in rnazol  at -20°c. rna was prepared using qiagen rneasy mini kit  followed by ammonium acetate precipitation. to minimize the effect of biological variation between individual animals, total rna from three age- and genotype-matched mice were pooled to constitute each sample. a total of three rna samples were analyzed at each time point for wt and scnn1b-tg mice.

macrophage rna preparation
male scnn1b-tg mice and wt littermates were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal administration of  <dig> , <dig> tribromoethanol . the lungs were lavaged at least  <dig> times with calcium- and magnesium-free dpbs supplemented with  <dig>  mm edta with the volume determined on weight-based formula
 <cit> . magnetic-activated cell sorting  was used to purify macrophages using anti-ly-6g microbead kit . this approach selectively deplete granulocytes that predominantly express ly-6g as a surface marker
 <cit> . since bal cells include granulocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes and occasional dendritic and epithelial cells, the ly-6g negative fraction, in addition to macrophages, is expected to include lymphocytes, dendritic cells and epithelial cells, but these cells are rare in these preparations. bals cell pellets were suspended in 200 μl of macs buffer. 50 μl of anti-ly-6g-biotin solution was added followed by incubation at 4°c for 10 min. subsequently, 100 μl of anti-biotin microbeads and 150 μl of macs buffer were added followed by incubation at 4°c for 15 minutes. cell pellets washed with 10 ml macs buffer were dissolved in 500 μl of macs buffer. thereafter, macrophage isolation through negative selection was carried out according to manufacturer’s recommendations. ly-6g negative cells  were pelleted, snap-frozen, and stored at -80°c. at pnd  <dig>  pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig> time points, total macrophages collected from three genotype-matched pups were pooled to generate each sample. each sample at pnd  <dig> time point represents macrophages collected from individual mice. frozen macrophage pellets were lysed and homogenized in lysis buffer and qiashredder . genomic dna was eliminated using gdna eliminator spin columns . the rna was isolated using purelink rna mini kit .

cdna generation and microarray
12 ng rna was used to generate cdna using ovation pico wta system v <dig> kit . total rna or cdna samples were submitted to the unc functional genomics core for cdna preparation and hybridized to affymetrix mouse gene  <dig>  st arrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

microarray data analysis
probe level intensities from affymetrix genechip scanner  <dig> in .cel files were evaluated for quality by whole array statistics using affymetrix expression console software. gene expression analyses were performed using partek genomics suite v <dig>  . briefly, probeset intensities were extracted from .cel files by rma background correction following gc content and sequence adjustments, normalized using quantile normalization, and gene level intensities were summarized through median polish, based on a modified meta-probeset mapping  derived from affymetrix latest transcript annotation . the meta-probeset mapping consolidated all probesets to unique gene identifiers parsed from affymetrix transcript annotation with the following precedence: ensembl gene, refseq mrna, and genbank nucleotide identifiers. data quality, batch effect, and sample groupings were assessed by principle component analysis  with correlation dispersion matrices. differential gene expression was analyzed using anova and linear contrast between experimental groups. the resultant differential expression  p-values were adjusted for multiple test correction using the false discovery rate  by benjamini-hochberg method
 <cit> .

differentially expressed genes  were obtained through the combination of selected p-value and fold change filters , and normalized log <dig> intensities from individual arrays of degs were extracted for hierarchical clustering. normalized log <dig> intensities were used in gene set enrichment analyses  against gene sets derived from biological processes of the current gene ontology  annotation database and custom gene sets relevant to lung disease and cellular physiology. visual representations of gsea enrichment fdr q-values from multiple sample groups were generated by hierarchical clustering of the transformed q-values using cluster3
 <cit>  and java treeview
 <cit> . detailed data mining of gsea results from related go vocabulary terms was performed by extracting relationships between functional terms from the current go flat file download, and visualizing the resultant networks decorated by specific enrichment fdr q-values with cytoscape
 <cit> . the complete expression dataset has been submitted to the gene expression omnibus  database with the accession number of gse <dig> 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse <dig> 

protein extraction and western blotting
total protein was extracted from bal macrophages after lysing with radioimmuno precipitation assay buffer supplemented with  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig>  mm ddt and halt protease inhibitors . proteins were separated by sds-page  using mes buffer  and transferred to pvdf membranes. rabbit antibodies against fizz- <dig> , ym1/ <dig> , and α-tubulin  were used for the westerns. protein bands were analyzed using alexa fluor  <dig> goat anti-rabbit igg  or irdye <dig> anti-mouse igg . quantification was performed using odyssey and the data was normalized to α-tubulin. the data analysis was performed using unpaired two-tailed t-test on graph-pad prism .

RESULTS
whole lung gene expression patterns are altered by developmental age and scnn1b-tg expression
principal components analysis  revealed that age was the primary factor affecting global gene expression in lung specimens . pc <dig>  separated pnd  <dig> mice from older animals, while pc <dig>  separated pnd  <dig> and  <dig> from pnd  <dig>  scnn1b-tg mice clustered tightly with their wt littermates at all ages. by extending the analysis to evaluate pc <dig> and pc <dig>  the wt mice began to separate from scnn1b-tg mice, but only at pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig>  respectively . this pattern was also observed upon hierarchical clustering of a combined set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes  comparing pnd  <dig> expression values to all other time points for each genotype . the heat-map demonstrates that a majority of changes in global gene expression  occurred between pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig>  regardless of genotype.figure  <dig>

as predicted from the pca and the hierarchical clustering heat maps, robust differences in gene expression were present in both wt  and scnn1b-tg  mice across development, and the degs were qualitatively different among time intervals, consistent with the published reports highlighting the continual postnatal lung development
 <cit>  and gene expression profiling of developing murine lungs
 <cit> . the top degs up-regulated from pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> in wt  as well as scnn1b-tg  mice were largely non-coding rna species including long, non-coding rnas and mirnas. non-coding rnas tended to be robustly down-regulated between pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig>  while the specific functions of non-coding rnas are only now being evaluated, their hypothesized role as master regulators of cell development controlling transcriptional regulatory circuitry is consistent with this finding

top  <dig> developmentally up- and down-regulated genes from whole lung of scnn1b-tg mice between three separate age intervals. the fold-changes for these top  <dig> genes are shown for both scnn1b-tg and the wt mice.

* non-coding rna species.



interestingly, many of the top up-regulated genes from pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> in both wt and scnn1b-tg mice are related to goblet cell  function and are frequently associated with th <dig> inflammation in mice  
 <cit> . this finding is consistent with the overall th <dig> polarization characteristic of early postnatal immunity
 <cit>  and parallels the wave of goblet cell appearance observed histologically during this time frame
 <cit> . we speculate that these under-appreciated responses observed in developing lung are related to innate defense functions of mucus/mucus clearance during the early neonatal period. the fold-increase for this group of genes was always less in scnn1b-tg compared to wt during the pnd 3– <dig> interval. interestingly, while these genes were later down-regulated in wt mice during the pnd 10– <dig> interval, they continued to be up-regulated further at the later interval in scnn1b-tg mice . thus, failure to down-regulate these th <dig> response-associated genes, e.g., clca <dig>  chi3l <dig>  and chi3l <dig>  in the pnd 10– <dig> interval is a key developmental shift that occurs as a consequence of scnn1b-tg expression. also notable during the pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> interval was a large up-regulation of mmp <dig> in scnn1b-tg mice as compared to wt , consistent with the role of mmp <dig> as a contributor to the airspace enlargement in this model
 <cit> .

while evaluation of individual gene-level differences was informative, interpretation of collective expression patterns was aided by gene set enrichment analysis , which identified the top gene ontology groups that differed across developmental intervals . gsea analysis revealed that g-protein regulated signaling pathways capable of responding to various stimuli are established early in post-natal development  for both wt and scnn1b-tg mice . up- and down-regulated pathways were more similar between the two genotypes at the early  and late  intervals compared to the intermediate pnd  <dig> versus pnd  <dig> interval. the patterns observed in wt mice for the pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> interval suggest continued lung development based upon the up-regulation of pathways involved with reorganization of the extracellular matrix, epithelial cell migration, and continued maturation of vessels. during the same interval, down-regulation of pathways involved in defense and killing of pathogens suggests the establishment of immune homeostasis in wt mice. significant development of an adaptive immune response signature occurred during the pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig> interval in both lines of mice as indicated by up-regulation of go pathways involving humoral immune responses, lymphocyte immunity, antigen processing, and complement activation.table  <dig>

top ten developmentally up- and down-regulated gene ontology groups for whole lung in wt and scnn1b-tg mice between the specified developmental intervals. gene ontology groups in common between the wt and scnn1b-tg line are highlighted by bolded and italicized text. groups are only listed if fdr < <dig> .

*none indicates that no additional groups met the significance threshold fdr< <dig> .



scnn1b-tg mice showed early evidence of inflammatory signaling during the pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> interval as indicated by up-regulation of go inflammatory response and cytokine signaling pathways . up-regulated go groups related to mitosis at the pnd <dig> to pnd  <dig> interval in scnn1b-tg mice point to transgene expression-induced shifts in the mitotic state of the lung. furthermore, the down-regulation of go immune defense pathways seen in wt mice during the pnd  <dig> to pnd  <dig> interval was clearly disrupted in the scnn1b-tg line. indeed, closer evaluation identified a pattern whereby expression of the transgene altered normal developmental processes in subtle, but measureable, ways that were not immediately apparent . the absolute expression level of developmentally up-regulated genes was consistently less in the scnn1b-tg mice compared to wt, and at pnd  <dig>  a striking 97% of these genes had lower expression in scnn1b-tg mice compared to wt . an inverse phenomenon held true for genes that were developmentally down-regulated in wt mice, which trended towards higher expression in scnn1b-tg mice. while the fold-changes between scnn1b-tg and wt for these genes were generally subtle, the consistency of the pattern leads to the conclusion that expression of the transgene, and/or its resultant pathology, alters developmental pathways. the presence of an inflammatory stimulus in the context of developing lung tissue during this early post-natal timeframe in this model is highly relevant to human bronchopulmonary dysplasia , whereby the under-developed lungs of premature infants are subjected to inflammatory challenges leading to long-term consequences for lung health
 <cit> .

we next conducted analyses whereby the specific genes and pathways altered by transgene expression at the four time points were determined . despite the robust pathological findings consistently observed in scnn1b-tg mice after pnd  <dig> , overexpression of the scnn1b transgene in the club cells produced surprisingly few significant  gene expression changes as evaluated from whole lung rna : only  <dig> combined degs , were identified between scnn1b-tg and wt mice . as expected, the scnn1b transgene was up-regulated at all time-points . a majority of degs were up-regulated only at pnd  <dig>  with only a few genes  robustly down-regulated, and very few genes differentially expressed at pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig> time points. the down-regulated group at pnd  <dig> included genes , associated with th <dig> inflammatory processes and mucous cell functions, as described above .figure  <dig>

differentially expressed  genes between wt versus scnn1b-tg from whole lung. genes are listed if they were significant at one or more of the four developmental stages measured. fold-change represents scnn1b-tg:wt. up-regulated and down-regulated fold-changes are highlighted bold and italics, respectively.

since scnn1b-tg expression is driven by the promoter for scgb1a <dig> gene , and because club cells are transiently necrotic during early postnatal life
 <cit> , we looked specifically at scgb1a <dig> gene expression as a surrogate for club cell function. levels of scgb1a <dig> were modestly reduced in scnn1b-tg mice compared to wt at pnd  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , but not at pnd  <dig> . these data indicate that normal club cell function was disrupted during early post-natal life as a result of transgene expression, as expected from histological findings, and that disruption of club cell function may be contributing to early inflammatory processes
 <cit> . however, in the chronic state of muco-obstruction observed at pnd  <dig>  club cell function as measured by scgb1a <dig> expression was normal.

evaluation of gene ontology terms associated with the differentially regulated genes was only moderately informative, since the genes belonged to multiple annotation categories that only rarely overlapped . however, after a review of the literature, most of the degs at pnd  <dig>  i.e., when chronic disease is firmly established, fell into expected functional categories, e.g., genes broadly related to lung inflammatory processes , neutrophil influx , activation of adaptive immunity , dendritic cells ; macrophages  or epithelial responses to stimuli . a significant number of the degs were associated with classic th <dig> inflammatory responses  and alternative  macrophage polarization  .

analyses of gsea pathways differentially expressed between wt and scnn1b-tg mice at the different time points confirmed up-regulation of inflammatory responses starting at pnd  <dig>  and revealed novel responses associated with the establishment of obstructive lung disease, such as up-regulation of go cilia-specific pathways at pnd  <dig>  alterations in tissue organization and development  and possible disturbances in the establishment of lung immune homeostasis  . by pnd  <dig>  there were no down-regulated pathways that met the significance threshold.table  <dig>

overall, these data suggest that defective airway mucus clearance due to scnn1b-tg overexpression, although originated in a relatively small compartment, i.e., the airway epithelia, which comprises less than 2% of the total lung surface area, can lead to transcriptional modifications that affect other lung compartments and cell populations, e.g., parenchymal and myeloid lineages, which are strong enough to be detected in whole lung preparations. however, the relative dearth of robust gene-level signatures, especially at the earlier time points, suggested that evaluating gene expression in purified cell populations would be informative. due to the robust morphological activation of macrophages in the scnn1b-tg mice, the tendency for genes involved in macrophage function to be up-regulated in whole lung , and the importance of this cell type in lung disease pathogenesis, we continued our studies by evaluating gene expression in purified pulmonary macrophages.

macrophage degs between scnn1b-tg and wt are robust and dynamic
we hypothesized that defective mucus clearance would alter lung macrophage gene expression and, consequently, we studied purified bal macrophages from wt and scnn1b-tg mice at the previously utilized developmental stages. furthermore, to evaluate the contribution of lung bacterial infections, the gene expression profiles of lung macrophages purified from germ-free  scnn1b-tg and wt littermates at pnd  <dig> were also studied. in addition to macrophages, the harvested bal preparations includes lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, with the contribution of each cell type varying between wt and scnn1b-tg and among developmental time points. to minimize granulocytes proportions in the bal, macrophages were purified by negative selection for ly6g expression , and pools with  <dig> % ±  <dig> %  purity were obtained . lack of ly-6g expression in all macrophage preparations used in this study was confirmed by gene array data .

pca analysis of purified macrophage arrays showed both age and genotype as drivers of global gene expression variation . pc <dig> separated macrophages at pnd  <dig> from later time points. however, pc <dig> separated macrophages from scnn1b-tg and wt mice at pnd  <dig>  pnd  <dig>  and pnd  <dig>  indicating disease-specific activation of gene signatures. pnd  <dig> wt and scnn1b-tg macrophages separated primarily in pc <dig>  with other pcs reflecting either age or other unexplained variation . interestingly, macrophages purified from germ-free  mice clustered close to their age-matched spf counterparts.figure  <dig>

 <dig>  gf = germ-free.



as with the whole lung, the population of macrophages purified from the bal exhibited robust developmental patterns, evident at all time points . evaluation of the top-signaling genes generated a complex picture with a number of obvious differences between wt and scnn1b-tg mice, especially noticeable at the pnd  <dig> versus pnd  <dig> interval, where genes down-regulated in wt mice were up-regulated in scnn1b-tg mice  and vice versa . the especially robust differential gene expression between the pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig> time point  is consistent with previous studies identifying this interval as a key interval for alveolar macrophage differentiation
 <cit> . robust up-regulation of siglec <dig> and itgax  between pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig>  which then stabilized between all other intervals , confirmed the previous observations that these cell surface markers appear suddenly and that they define the resident alveolar macrophage population immediately after birth in mice
 <cit> . this dataset may be especially useful to identify transcriptional changes that accompany siglec <dig> and itgax up-regulation during this critical time.table  <dig>

top ten developmentally up- and down-regulated gene ontology groups for purified macrophages in wt and scnn1b-tg mice between the specified developmental intervals. gene ontology groups in common between the wt and scnn1b-tg line are highlighted by bolded and italicized text. groups are only listed if fdr < <dig> .

*none indicates that no groups met the significance threshold .



gsea pathways analysis was more informative than gene-level data to establish the overall trends . in the pnd 0– <dig> interval, wt macrophages exhibited up-regulation of go pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation, and, interestingly, up-regulation of pathways in wt mice at the later two intervals was minimal. down-regulated signals during the pnd 0– <dig> interval suggest that these early post-natal macrophages have the ability to respond to signals that are directing normal lung development and differentiation. we cannot rule out the possibility that the macrophage preparations contain a small percentage of epithelial cells, which would confound interpretation. however, epithelial cell contamination was not obvious histologically . the strength of down-regulated signals in macrophages for go lung and respiratory development pathways  during this interval suggest that lung epithelium and macrophages use similar signals to coordinate differentiation between the two tissues. down-regulation of the cell proliferation pathways occurring in the wt and scnn1b-tg mice at the pnd 10– <dig> period are consistent with the establishment of long-lived, slow proliferating pulmonary macrophage populations during steady state
 <cit> . significant down-regulation of go innate immune response pathways in both lines during the pnd 3– <dig> interval points toward the steady-state, mature pulmonary macrophage as relatively quiescent and tolerant toward low danger stimuli. finally, unlike wt macrophages, scnn1b-tg macrophages exhibited up-regulation of pathways involved in innate immune responses as expected from their morphologically activated state, with the gsea signatures being especially robust between the pnd  <dig> and pnd  <dig> . further exploration by directly comparing gene expression between wt and scnn1b-tg macrophages provided additional insights.

as expected from the pca, degs were identified between wt and scnn1b-tg macrophages at each time point evaluated, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs at pnd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, using the established significance threshold  . as expected from the previous discussion, the top-signaling genes vary across time and represent a variety of biological processes . the most significant go pathways up-regulated by disease at pnd  <dig> are related to muscle cell gene expression, which is difficult to reconcile with the known literature on pulmonary macrophages. however, by pnd  <dig> and onward, significant up-regulation of a variety of inflammatory signatures was observed in the scnn1b-tg mice compared to wt mice . the down-regulation of go pathways related to mitosis in scnn1b-tg mice at the earlier time points  indicate that scnn1b-tg pulmonary macrophages are less prolific than their wt counterparts at these early post-natal ages, a shift that is likely a response to the altered cytokine milieu that develops in the scnn1b-tg mice as a response to the signals that are arising from the bacterial infections and/or necrotic club cells at these time points.table  <dig>

custom-annotated pathways allow assessment of disease-specific features
the previously described gsea analysis, based on publically available go pathway annotations, provided evidence for activation of relevant biological pathways in both lung and macrophages during the development of disease. however, due to incomplete annotation, go pathways are not expected to capture all processes specifically associated with lung biology and pulmonary diseases. we hypothesized that additional insights could be provided utilizing custom pathway annotations created to query known, disease-relevant processes. to query our gene expression data for transcriptional events associated with specific pathologic features of the scnn1b-tg model, customized gene lists were generated that reflected genes hypothesized or known to be involved in the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive lung diseases . custom pathways were developed either from compilation of literature, e.g., m <dig> polarized versus m <dig> polarized pathways, or by selecting genes known to be regulated under specific experimental conditions  or cell-specific markers  . a further group of pathways representing a number of disease-relevant gene expression signatures from human studies as defined by chowdhary et. al. <cit>  were also queried . literature and database references, as well as details related to the selection of genes in these pathways, are provided .figure  <dig> 
gsea using custom gene sets.  custom gene sets representing putatively relevant processes were used for gsea . the fdr values were converted into enrichment scores for clustering by the formula, score =  <dig>  – . red and green indicated up- and down- regulation, respectively. genes in the custom sets and their sources are described in additional file
5: results file s <dig>   heat-map as described in  for "respiratory disease" pathways
 <cit>  and copd-specific pathways
 <cit> .



using these custom annotations, significant gsea disease-relevant signatures were identified that were tissue/cell specific and time-dependent . in macrophages, substantial evidence for polarization into both m <dig> and m <dig> phenotypes was detected. with respect to whole lung, a previously unappreciated up-regulation of ciliated cell- and dendritic cell-specific genes in scnn1b-tg was identified at pnd 3– <dig> and pnd  <dig>  respectively. mucous cell signatures were consistently found in whole lung at pnd  <dig> that correlated with the expression of epithelial genes previously reported to be induced by sam-pointed domain–containing ets-like factor , a transcriptional regulator of mucous cell differentiation in mouse and humans
 <cit> . gene signatures for mucus production were consistent with previous reports
 <cit> . interestingly, strong up-regulation of spdef-associated genes was also observed in macrophages at each time point. a mucous cell signature in pnd  <dig> whole lungs, which correlated with up-regulation of genes normally suppressed by spdef over-expression, was also detected, suggesting a time-dependent activation of alternative pathways. the gene expression pattern of whole lung for secreted antimicrobials correlated with the location and timing of spontaneous infection in scnn1b-tg mice. signatures for hypoxia and protease/anti-protease activation were more variable across tissues and time points and more difficult to interpret.

importantly for the use of this model in the context of human disease, strong up-regulation of human lung disease-specific signatures, including those for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were observed in both the lungs  and macrophages  . specifically, the positive association of degs in this study with human deg disease signatures is seen at the later time points . these two time points reflect the establishment and maintenance of the chronic lung disease state in this model. thus, it is not surprising that they reflect the human tissue better than the earlier time points, since human disease signatures are derived from tissue of patients with established disease, and for the most part, except for bpd, they reflect diseases development that occurs in already mature human lungs.

evidence for time-dependent m <dig> and m <dig> polarization in scnn1b-tg macrophages
because of our interest in the state of pulmonary macrophages in response to disease development, the expression of m <dig> and m <dig> markers  compiled after extensive literature review
 was carefully examined, and the results summarized in heatmaps . the heatmaps highlight the dynamic nature of the macrophage response to airway surface dehydration/defective mucus clearance. enrichment of both m <dig> and m <dig> pathways was evident in pnd  <dig> macrophages, but m <dig> signatures were particularly robust at pnd  <dig> and m <dig> signatures particularly robust at pnd  <dig>  the m <dig> signature, while still evident, was clearly different at pnd  <dig> compared to earlier time points, with increased expression of some genes  and decreased expression of others genes  compared to pnd  <dig>  similarly, some m <dig> markers were exclusively high at pnd  <dig> , and others at pnd  <dig> . in addition, some m <dig>  and m <dig>  markers were consistently up-regulated during pnd 3– <dig> interval . the m <dig> and m <dig> signatures were also identified globally in whole lung . the enrichment in m <dig> markers at pnd  <dig> was confirmed by evaluating protein levels of retnla , chi3l <dig> , and chi3l <dig>  in bal extracts .figure  <dig>

6: results file s <dig>  each column represents data from one array , with wt or scnn1b-tg  status listed above the columns. each row represents a single gene.



this activation pattern is consistent with the presence of necrotic cells and bacteria in the lungs of the scnn1b-tg mice at pnd  <dig> and the requirement for macrophages to participate in their clearance via up-regulation of th <dig>  responses. because th <dig> responses are known to inhibit th <dig> responses
 <cit> , including mucous cell metaplastic responses, we hypothesize that the robust th <dig>  responses at pnd  <dig> and  <dig> dampen the th2-skewed environment normally seen in early post-natal lung development identified in this study and described elsewhere
 <cit> . the shift to m <dig> polarization after pnd  <dig> reflects the more chronic nature of lung disease, featuring mucus accumulation, but no overt bacterial colonization and normal club cell morphology and function . m <dig> macrophages are known to be critical for defense against atypical fungal and helminth infections
 <cit> , and an increase in m2-like alveolar macrophages is characteristic of many inflammatory lung diseases in both humans and mice
 <cit> , but the reason for the shift to m <dig> in our model is not clear. we hypothesize that this  is directly related to the presence of dehydrated mucus with trapped endogenous and exogenous noxious particles and the ability of the macrophages to sense the need to clear this material from the airways. this shift to m <dig> clearly is expected to have profound consequences, since it is not the normal state in health, and extended long-term activation of m <dig> macrophages is associated with the establishment of chronic lung disease
 <cit> . future studies should focus on defining the signals within mucus plugs that drive m <dig> polarization.

the dynamic nature of both the m <dig> and m <dig> signatures, with separate groups of genes activated at different time points, also likely reflects the intrinsic variety of the pulmonary macrophage population
 <cit> . our sampling technique did not allow a distinction between macrophages residing in localized niches within the lung. besides the obvious distinction between conducting airway and alveolar spaces, we postulate the existence of several sub-niches where local signals regulate local macrophage phenotypes. these would include areas of localized hypoxia, infections, necrotic/apoptotic cell death, aspiration, and mucus plugging, with the frequency and importance of each of these niches shifting across development
 <cit> .

whole lung and macrophages produce independent inflammatory signals
to further explore the inflammatory signals originating from, or possibly leading to, the m <dig> and m <dig> polarization patterns, the "cytokine production" node within gene ontology biological process was scrutinized . at pnd  <dig>  the only signs of activation of this node were in macrophages . genes in this go node were not activated in whole lung until pnd  <dig> with signals increasing further at pnd  <dig> . while this analysis shows robust activation of the go node related to scnn1b-tg expression, careful gene-level evaluation of these signatures revealed that they were primarily derived from either whole lung, e.g., cxcl <dig>  chia, and ltf, or macrophages , with only a few genes producing signal from both tissues, e.g., ccl <dig>  chi3l <dig>  and tnfrsf <dig> . overall, macrophages exhibited more robust signals than whole lung, with both up-regulated and a small number of down-regulated genes identified. because we had seen activation of a number of macrophage markers in whole lung , we hypothesized that much of the signal detected from whole lung originated from the activated macrophage population. however, it is clear from our data  that for most degs, the epithelial/parenchymal compartment and the macrophages uniquely contribute to the inflammatory signaling in response to airway mucus obstruction. within each tissue, as for the m <dig> and m <dig> genes , degs tended to differ across time, e.g., genes robustly signaling in macrophages at pnd  <dig>  which were enriched for kegg "pancreatic cancer" pathways containing tgfb <dig> , were substantially different than those signaling at pnd  <dig> , and those signaling at pnd  <dig> . while a detailed analysis of all of the potential mechanistic insights provided by this report is beyond the scope of this publication, this study provides a framework for future efforts directed at individual signaling molecules and further highlights the usefulness of this model for a variety of pulmonary disease research questions.figure  <dig>

scnn1b-tg macrophage gene signatures were comparable but more robust in gf vs. spf environment
gf macrophages from either wt or scnn1b-tg mice were very similar compared to their spf counterparts , and only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed across the four groups at the selected significance threshold . this result is significant because it demonstrates that macrophage activation, at least in the chronic disease state present at pnd  <dig>  is not dependent upon the presence of microbes or microbe-derived products, consistent with our previous discussion. by extension, macrophage activation at this stage must be in response to the consequence of epithelial transgene overexpression, namely, airway surface dehydration and the resultant mucus stasis. the gene expression findings are consistent with previous histological analysis in the gf scnn1b-tg colony
 <cit>  and reinforce our hypothesis that, if airway surfaces are dehydrated, static mucus itself and/or abiotic materials concentrated in dehydrated mucus, trigger and maintain lung inflammation and airway remodeling.figure  <dig>

while the differential gene expression in the gf macrophages was qualitatively similar between the gf and spf scnn1b-tg macrophages , the quantitative fold-change was higher in gf compared to spf scnn1b-tg mice, and gsea analysis showed a more robust up-regulation of custom gene set  and multiple immune system  pathways in macrophages from gf compared to spf scnn1b-tg mice . we speculate that the absence of environmental bacteria and their products altered the homeostatic mechanisms that normally prevent excessive activation of resident macrophages, predisposing gf mice to exaggerated responses to external challenges, including airway surface dehydration . these findings are congruent with excessive activation as a key feature of gut inflammatory responses in mice raised in germ-free conditions and they highlight the role of endogenous microflora in establishment of immune homeostasis in the lung as well
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the gene expression analyses reported here provide a global appreciation for the complexity of the development of lung disease in the scnn1b-tg model. importantly, the initiating stimulus in the model, i.e., mucus dehydration, is present during early postnatal life, allowing unique investigations into the relationships between a defined disease stimulus  and postnatal lung development. this feature, which leads to emphysema, provides a setting to study the pathogenic crosstalk between mucus obstructed and inflamed airways and alveoli, processes that are likely important in children with bpd, cf, and copd-like pediatric diseases. the th <dig> airway inflammation produced as part of the "insult" transmitted from the airways to the alveolar compartments is a likely culprit in the scnn1b-tg mice. our studies also reveal macrophages as early responders to airway mucus stasis and as possible communicators of inflammatory signals from the airways to the alveoli.

in contrast, the gene expression changes identified during the chronic stage of disease are more reflective of typical adult onset muco-obstructive lung diseases. moving forward, separating the two phase of disease will be necessary to define pathogenic mechanisms. the complexity of gene signatures additionally point toward the necessity of considering cell-specific, and even site-specific, signals in future studies. further evaluation of cell-specific lineages, including those of airway epithelial cells and macrophages purified from different lung compartments , will be invaluable to generate an integrated picture of the pathways leading to lung disease in this model and likely inform translational therapeutic efforts.
