BACKGROUND
chagas disease is a serious illness discovered by carlos chagas in  <dig>  <cit> , which is caused by the protozoan parasite trypanosoma cruzi. about  <dig> to  <dig> million people are infected worldwide, mostly in latin america where chagas disease is endemic. in  <dig>  chagas disease killed more than  <dig>  individuals  <cit> . t. cruzi is usually transmitted to humans by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine bugs, although the parasites can also be transmitted through unconventional ways, including blood transfusions, organ transplants, congenital factors, laboratory accidents and oral transmission by ingestion of contaminated food  <cit> .

t. cruzi undergoes remarkable morphological and physiological changes during development in both insect and mammalian hosts, adopting four distinct forms: epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes in the invertebrate vector and amastigotes and bloodstream trypomastigotes in vertebrate hosts  <cit> . epimastigotes and amastigotes are replicative forms, whereas metacyclic and bloodstream trypomastigotes are infective, non-replicative forms.

analysis of differentiation processes such as metacyclogenesis  that lead to infectivity are of great interest. this differentiation can be reproduced in vitro , making it possible to isolate intermediate forms and study the time course of this process. although in vitro metacyclogenesis is conducted under chemically defined conditions, the cultivation of epimastigote forms  is carried on in a complex high nutritive medium called lit  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum   <cit> . several components of this medium have an unknown composition, including yeast extract, liver infusion, tryptose and fbs. these components may contain growth factors, vitamins, hormones, proteins, lipids or other factors that can influence many biological aspects of the parasite. furthermore, the quality and origin of the animal sources of these components are highly variable. these variations can potentially affect growth and differentiation rates, as well as responses to drugs, hindering the analysis of experimental results conducted in this context.

use of a chemically defined medium for the cultivation of t. cruzi could improve the current scenario helping to develop more uniform and standardized assays. for example, in a drug discovery context, it would bring more reproducibility and reliability to the testing of new trypanocidal drugs, as well as studying their effects and their mechanisms of action in this parasite . in addition, use of a defined medium is essential for many useful assays, such as perturbation of medium components, cellular metabolic labeling and measurement of metabolites secreted by cells in the medium.

several articles have already been published showing the cultivation of different strains of t. cruzi epimastigotes in defined media. in  <dig>  azevedo and roitman published a research note  <cit>  communicating the continuous cultivation of y strain in a defined medium – ar- <dig> – which was developed based on a previous defined medium for cultivation of t. brucei procyclic cells named hx <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  anderson and krassner  <cit> , as well as cross and coworkers  <cit> , showed successful cultivation of costa rica and sonya strains, respectively, in hx <dig> defined medium. avila and coworkers cultivated strains y, ma, fl and marin- <dig> of t. cruzi in a defined medium containing only d-glucose, inorganic salts, some vitamins, nucleotides and bovine liver catalase  <cit> . later they developed a minimal medium based on the previous, where nucleotides and vitamins had been excluded  <cit> . however, these results were criticized by o’daly and rodriguez  <cit> , since they showed the existence of  <dig> to  <dig> protein bands as well as dna and rna polymers contaminating the solution of bovine liver catalase used in the medium.

thereafter, few published reports showed the cultivation of t. cruzi in a defined medium, and all of them only for a single passage, highlighting the challenge of continuously cultivating this parasite over long periods under defined conditions.

in the present work we demonstrate a continuous cultivation of t. cruzi epimastigote cells in two defined media derived from hx25m  <cit> , named lm <dig> and lm14b. with these media, we cultivate five different strains of t. cruzi for more than forty passages. morphology in defined conditions was maintained, as well as the parasite’s ability to differentiate to infective forms. defined media described herein are powerful tools, indispensable for the application of several methods that could not be performed using non-defined media.

RESULTS
hx25m and ar- <dig> media are not sufficient for t. cruzi cultivation
litb+fbs is a complex high nutritive medium in which t. cruzi is routinely cultivated. the high complexity of the medium makes it infeasible to modify, removing or replacing its components. for this purpose, we tested the growth and maintenance of t. cruzi cells in both defined media ar- <dig> and hx25m. hx25m was developed to cultivate t. brucei cells  <cit> , and has also been used to cultivate t. cruzi  <cit> , while ar- <dig> was developed based on hx25m and is used only for t. cruzi cultivation  <cit> .

to evaluate the growth rate of cells cultivated in defined media, ar- <dig> and hx25m media were tested for t. cruzi cultivation . growth rates after three days of cultivation were compared with litb+fbs medium, the routinely used medium for t. cruzi cultivation, and litb without fbs, once fbs is absent in defined media. cultures were maintained over five passages , all starting from 1e +  <dig> cells/ml. after the fourth passage, there was no cell growth in both hx25m or ar- <dig>  indicating that these media do not support t. cruzidm28c cell growth in these conditions. we obtained similar results in independent experiments performed using different batches of media at different times and using different types of flasks and plates .figure  <dig> 
growth comparison between defined  and complex  media. epimastigote cells counts were performed every three days, then all cultures were diluted to 1e +  <dig> cells/ml . values plotted refer to the average of three biological replicates counted every cell passage after three days of cultivation. cell cultivation in litb+fbs  and litb without fbs  was maintained for five passages of three days, whereas defined media hx25m  and ar- <dig>  did not support cell growth after the third passage.



putrescine allows continuous growth of t. cruzi in defined media
t. cruzi epimastigotes are auxotrophic for diamines, such as putrescine since t. cruzi, unlike other trypanosomatids, lacks the genes encoding either ornithine decarboxylase or arginine decarboxylase , enzymes responsible for putrescine biosynthesis . diamines are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation and macromolecular synthesis  <cit> . t. cruzi is able to convert exogenous putrescine to trypanothione and cadaverine to homotrypanothione, antioxidants which are unique to the kinetoplastids and fulfill many of the roles ascribed to glutathione in other eukaryotic cells  <cit> .

ar- <dig> and hx25m media lack diamines in their formulations, requiring the addition of at least one of them. therefore, we tested cultivation of t. cruzi in defined media supplemented with 10 micromolar of putrescine . figure  <dig> shows that parasites cultivated in ar-103+p died after the fourth passage , whereas parasites in hx25m+p exhibited continuous growth, with increasing growth rate after several passages .figure  <dig> 
putrescine and biopterine test in cell culture. putrescine was added at 10 μm final concentration in defined media hx25m  and ar- <dig> . biopterin was added at final concentration of 1 μm in defined medium hx25m with  or without  putrescine. epimastigote cells counts were performed every three days, then all cultures were diluted to 1e +  <dig> cells/ml . values plotted refer to the average of three biological replicates counted every cell passage after three days of culture. epimastigote cultures were maintained for six passages in hx25m+p defined medium , whereas cells cultivated in ar-103+p defined medium , even with putrescine, died after the third passage. epimastigotes cultivated in hx25m+b medium  died after the third passage. epimastigotes cultivated in hx25m+p+b medium  showed a significant increase in growth rate compared to hx25m+p medium  .



these results show that defined media ar- <dig> and hx25m were not sufficient for continuous cultivation of t. cruzi cells, contradicting the results obtained by azevedo and roitman  <cit> , anderson and krassner  <cit>  and cross et al.  <cit> , being putrescine an essential compound for this purpose. ar- <dig> medium, even with putrescine, does not sustain continuous growth of t. cruzi in our hands.

putrescine is greater than 97% pure and since addition of this compound alone, to a final concentration of  <dig> micromolar, was sufficient to convert medium from non-growth sustaining to growth sustaining we can rule out that any contaminant as being responsible for the acquired growth.

biopterin accelerates t. cruzi growth in defined medium
biopterin is a biologically significant pterin that functions as an essential cofactor for several enzymes involved in processes including hydroxylations, ether-lipid cleavage, and nitric oxide synthase . some trypanosomatids, like leishmania, crithidia and t. brucei, are unable to synthesize the pterin moiety from gtp  and thus must acquire pteridines from the host by salvage mechanisms .

biopterin was added to defined medium, with  or without  putrescine, at a final concentration of 1 μm. the growth rate was measured by counting at every three days of cultivation for five passages. biopterin was not sufficient for continuous cultivation of t. cruzi without putrescine , but addition of biopterin to hx25m+p medium significantly increased the growth rate of the parasites compared to medium without biopterin hx25m+p  .

the results presented above show that putrescine is required for t. cruzi epimastigote cultivation and biopterin shows growth stimulation of these parasites. these modified media were named lm <dig>  and lm14b .

comparisons between parasite growth curves in defined and complex media were obtained by cultivating epimastigote forms at an initial density of 1e +  <dig> cells/ml, until they reached stationary phase or cell death. stationary growth phase was reached on the 7th day for lm <dig>  and litb without fbs  . as observed in litb+fbs cultures, stationary growth phase of parasites cultivated in lm14b is reached at the 5th day  . although growth rate of parasites cultivated in lm14b is slower than in litb+fbs, when compared to cells growing in litb without fbs it is notably faster. this result suggests that lm14b defined medium is better suited for t. cruzi growth than the standard medium litb when fbs is absent.figure  <dig>

in defined  and complex  media. epimastigote cells counts were performed at every 24 hours, for eight days . values plotted refer to the average of three biological replicates. epimastigotes cultivated in defined medium lm14b  had a similar profile of growth curve to parasites cultivated in litb+fbs , reaching the stationary phase at 5th day, as well as a similar growth curve was observed for epimastigotes cultivated in lm <dig>  and litb w/o fbs .



to verify whether there are any undefined protein and/or dna fragment present, we performed a sds-polyacrylamide electrophoresis as well as an agarose gel electrophoresis of tested medium . only a 60–70 kda protein was observed, mass related to albumin  <cit> , which is added to the defined medium . also we did not observe any dna fragment in the defined media. these results indicate that there are no protein or dna contaminants in the tested defined medium, at least with the sensibility reached by the detection methodology used.

parasites cultivated in lm <dig> and lm14b defined media can differentiate in vitro into metacyclic trypomastigotes
in vitro metacyclogenesis was performed to test the biological capability of t. cruzi cells to differentiate after cultivation in the defined medium. epimastigotes forms cultivated in lm <dig> defined medium showed a differentiation rate of about 30% to metacyclic trypomastigotes after 72 hours of differentiation, a similar differentiation rate found in parasites from litb+fbs medium  under the same conditions. we also observed spontaneous metacyclic trypomastigote forms from the third day of culture in lm <dig> medium, before the stimuli for differentiation . interestingly, parasites cultivated in lm14b defined medium, although exhibiting a better growth rate than in lm <dig> and absence of spontaneous metacyclic trypomastigotes before the stress stimuli, they showed a much lower differentiation rate, about 18% of metacyclic trypomastigotes after 72 hours of differentiation. this event can be compared to that observed in leishmania major, where a tetrahydrobiopterin  deficiency in promastigote forms increased differentiation into the mammalian-infectious metacyclic promastigote form, probably indicating a role of pterins in resistance to oxidative stress, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure  <cit> .figure  <dig>

although parasites from lm14b exhibit a lower differentiation rate compared to those in litb+fbs, the process is still occurring in this condition and can be performed with parasites from lm <dig> medium with a higher differentiation rate. this represent a strong indication that the biological capabilities of t. cruzi in our defined medium are maintained.

we also analyzed the ultrastructure of t. cruzi epimastigotes cultivated in litb+fbs, litb without serum and lm14b media to verify possible morphological alterations in cells cultivated in defined medium, when compared with conventional complex medium. analysis of t. cruzi ultrathin sections by transmission electron microscopy showed no visible alteration in cell shape or intracellular organelle content , showing that the morphology of t. cruzi cultivated in lm14b is maintained.

different t. cruzi strains can be cultivated in lm14b defined medium
t. cruzi is a highly polymorphic specie. the biological, biochemical and genetic diversity of t. cruzi isolates has long been recognized . over the years, several approaches have been used to separate the t. cruzi population into different groups, or discrete typing units . recently, zingales and coworkers reorganized by consensus the nomenclature of these dtus as tci-tcvi  <cit> .

we selected strains from different dtus to test their suitability to grow in lm14b defined medium. they were: colombiana and dm28c , esmeraldo , cl <dig> and cl brener . our findings clearly demonstrate that lm14b medium was efficient for cultivating all tested t. cruzi strains in defined conditions, even better than cultivation in litb medium without fbs .figure  <dig>

strains in lm14b defined medium. epimastigote counts were performed at every three days, then all cultures were diluted to 1e +  <dig> cells/ml . values plotted refer to the average of three biological replicates, with counts at every third day of culture.



CONCLUSIONS
our data report the development of a defined medium for t. cruzi cultivation. despite previously published work reporting sustained cultivation of t. cruzi in defined medium, we could not reproduce such results. therefore, to our knowledge, lm <dig> and lm14b are the only chemically defined medium capable of continuous axenic t. cruzi cultivation  while maintaining t. cruzi morphology and ability to differentiate. both defined media described herein present important advances to study the cell biology of this parasite, since they enable metabolic labeling, drugs research and evaluation, metabolic studies, among other powerful methods, providing new perspectives for further studies related to t. cruzi biochemistry.
