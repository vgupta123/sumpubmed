BACKGROUND
the genus avena belongs to the grass family poaceae  <cit> . it comprises about seventy species, although mainly a. sativa, a. nuda and a. byzantina are those most commonly cultivated on a commercial scale. a. sativa is an economically important crop and ranks sixth in world cereal production after wheat, maize, rice, barley and sorghum  <cit> . oat is grown for grain and hay and is mostly used as a feed for cattle. in 2008- <dig>  oat was cultivated on  <dig>  million hectares mostly in temperate areas in the usa, canada and europe, but also on significant areas in china, brazil and australia  <cit> . oat is well adapted to a wide range of soil types and performs better than many other small grain cereals on both acidic and alkaline soils  <cit> .

oat seeds have good nutritional value with a high content of essential dietary minerals, unsaturated fatty acids, unique galacto-lipids and the highest levels of globular proteins amongst any cereal. they also have high levels of mixed ,  β-d-glucans  <cit> , which are beneficial for digestion and have cholesterol-lowering properties  <cit> . moreover, oat contains compounds such as tocopherols, inositol phosphates and avenanthramides which possess antioxidative properties  <cit> .

in the last few years, the awareness-increase of the health-beneficial properties of oats has lead to a heightened consumption in great britain and the scandinavian countries  <cit> . even though traditional oat breeding has been successful in continuously improving the beneficial properties of oat, further enhancement is possible. a winter oat may increase the average yield by more than 20%  <cit> , a more easily digestible kernel containing a low lignin hull would increase the energy value of the feed by 15%  <cit> , an oat rich in β-glucan fibres would further increase the health beneficial properties for humans  <cit>  and a low mycotoxin oat would exclude oat products from the new threshold values for mycotoxin levels that will be introduced in the european union during  <dig>  <cit> .

application of molecular techniques in oat breeding would facilitate the development of more complex characteristics. although marker assisted mapping programs are in progress  <cit> , generation of mutated oat lines by transposons, t-dna or rna interference techniques is technically difficult and has not been attempted. this is partly due to the lack of an efficient transformation system and partly due to the large genome size with an estimated 1c genome weight of  <dig>  pg, corresponding to about  <dig>  mbp  <cit> . the fact that cultivated oat is hexaploid  <cit>  and the genome not sequenced complicates the matter even further. therefore, although several oat ests are publicly available, many more will be required to cover the entire transcriptome  <cit> .

one way to increase variation in the breeding process would be to use radiation or chemical mutagens such as ems . ems is a highly mutagenic substance that preferentially alkylates guanine bases leading to the dna-polymerase favoring the placement of a thymine residue instead of a cytosine residue opposite to the o-6-ethyl guanine in the subsequent dna-replication step. this results in a random point mutation wherein g-c base-pairs  are switched to a-t pairs  <cit> . mutations in coding regions can be silent, missense or nonsense and mutations outside coding regions, like promoter mutations resulting in up- or down-regulation of transcription, aberrant splicing of mrna, altered mrna stability or changes in protein translation may also occur.

in tilling, high frequency mutagenesis is combined with molecular based, high precision selection methods. the power of tilling was first demonstrated in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  and has later been successfully applied to a number of plant systems including arabidopsis  <cit> , barley  <cit> , lotus japonicus  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , maize  <cit> , rice  <cit> , pea  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and naked oats  <cit> . if the mutation frequency is high enough, and the population size large enough, a mutated allele of most, if not all, genes will be present in the population. in combination with an efficient method to identify point mutations, for example the li-cor method  <cit> , it is possible to apply tilling to genetically complicated crops as well. the power of the principle was elegantly confirmed by the identification of number of waxy gene mutants in tilling populations of both tetraploid and hexaploid wheat where the corresponding waxy enzymes in some cases completely lost their activity  <cit> . moreover, a plant carrying a triple mutant, which displayed a near null waxy phenotype was also developed  <cit> . a tilling-population in a hexaploid oat with a reasonable mutation frequency should therefore, by analogy, be a very useful breeding tool. although li-cor based techniques are commonly used for screening for mutations, maldi-tof  based assays can also be used. in the maldi-tof, samples are ionised and then relocated to the mass analyser where they are separated according to their mass to charge ratio. the ions are then detected and analysed by means of specially developed software.

in this work, a tilling population for hexaploid oat, consisting of  <dig> different mutagenised seed lines was developed and the mutation frequency determined. to screen the population, a method based on maldi-tof masscleave protocol™  <cit>  was adapted for tilling. we demonstrated the potential of the oat tilling population by identifying several different mutations in the oat aspal <dig> and ascslf <dig> genes - key genes in the lignin and β-glucan biosynthetic pathways, respectively. these genes were chosen because they encode traits of great interest to oat breeders. a down-regulation of the pal will result in modified, more easily extractable lignins with increased digestibility  <cit> , which will in-turn increase the feed value of the crop. since β-glucans are becoming very important functional food ingredients, an oat variety with increased or modified β-glucan content in the seed will significantly increase the value of the crop. oat β-glucans have a health claim both in the us and in the eu and a regular consumption of oat β-glucans has been linked to a number of health beneficial effects like lowering of blood cholesterol levels, a decrease of the general glycemic index of ingested food and some protection against colon cancer  <cit> .

RESULTS
development of an oat tilling-population
to determine the optimal survival rate for tilling-applications, an ems titration kill curve for oat seeds was established at different ems concentrations . in total  <dig> different ems concentrations were used and ~ <dig> seeds were treated at each concentration. an ems concentration of  <dig> %  was finally chosen for large-scale mutagenesis, giving a predicted survival rate of approximately 37% . approximately  <dig> seeds were mutagenised, germinated and the surviving m <dig> plants were allowed to set seeds. of the  <dig> mutants that germinated,  <dig> mutants produced filled panicles, while the rest died, did not flower or produced empty panicles.

m <dig> seeds were harvested from each of the m <dig> lines and used to plant out the m <dig> population. out of  <dig> seeds planted,  <dig> germinated . the entire m <dig> life cycle was then followed and phenotypic abnormalities on individual plants in the segregating population were recorded. normally, phenotypic changes are extremely rare in a population of non-mutated belinda that has been inbred for generations . however, in the tilling-population chlorosis , semi-dwarfness , giants , dwarf and high tiller , late/early flowering and late senescence were frequently observed . in total, ca 5% of the mutagenised belinda population had visually detectable phenotypic alterations.

genomic dna was extracted from two-week-old leaves from each of the  <dig> different lines in the m <dig> population by the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide  method  <cit> . after flowering and seed production an average of  <dig> seeds  were harvested from each of the  <dig> fertile lines. these seeds make up the m <dig> tilling-population .

biochemical analysis of lignin content
the wiesner phloroglucinol-hc <dig> assay  <cit>  was used to screen for mutants with differential lignin deposition in the seed coat. m <dig> seeds from each line of approximately 70% of the population  were stained . typically, whole seeds, whole de-husked seeds and de-husked cross-sectioned seeds were tested. non-mutated belinda was used as a positive high lignin control and the canadian variety a. c. assiniboia  as a low lignin control. from these,  <dig> mutant lines were identified that showed lower stain intensity in the husk compared to belinda. a representative result is shown in figure  <dig> 

lignin quantification
although phloroglucinol-hcl assay is a rapid method, it is not quantitative. therefore, the lignin content in the mutant candidates was measured with the acetyl bromide method. this method is relatively simple and appropriate for small sample sizes. the method allows complete dissolution of lignin and hence provides precise absorbance values for total lignin content with little interference from non-lignin products  <cit> . for each line,  <dig> individual seeds were weighed and measured. the lignin content in belinda was  <dig>  g/kg and  <dig>  g/kg in assiniboia, a canadian low lignin variety. this is in good agreement with previous lignin tests on assiniboia  <cit> . in the identified mutant lines, lignin contents were in the range of 20- <dig> g/kg. line # <dig> was the lowest with  <dig>  g/kg, which is in the same range as in assiniboia .

estimation of the mutation frequency by rapd-pcr
even though the number of visual phenotypes in a population indirectly reflects the number of mutations in the genome, it is not feasible to estimate the mutation frequency in this way due to gene redundancy, silent mutations and the fact that oat is hexaploid. therefore, to better approximate the mutation frequency a rapd-pcr  method was exploited. briefly, using short random  <dig> bp primers, chromosomal dna from non-mutated belinda was amplified. after standardizing pcr reactions with belinda wt dna as a template,  <dig> different bands were routinely obtained with the particular primer combination used. when analyzing dna from  <dig> independent lines using the same pcr conditions,  <dig> mutants were found where the band pattern differed from non-mutagenised belinda . a gain or loss of a band will occur if the particular chromosomal sequence to which the random primer binds, has at least one mutated bp. assuming a target size of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bands covers a target of  <dig> bp. one mutation per  <dig> lines therefore indicates an average mutation frequency in each line of approximately one mutation per  <dig> kb.

cloning of pal and cslf genes
a genomic aspal <dig> sequence of  <dig> bp including one  <dig> bp long intron  and a  <dig> bp long partial ascslf <dig> mrna was obtained . the sequences of both genes have been submitted to genbank, accession number for aspal <dig> is gq <dig> and gq <dig> for ascslf <dig> 

mutant discovery by maldi-tof analysis
primers were designed and amplification products separated on agarose gels to confirm the expected product and to rule out unspecific products. fragments with the expected size from several independent reactions were then sequenced to confirm that only a single sequence had been amplified. in the final pcr reactions,  <dig> bp from ascsfl <dig> and  <dig> bp from the aspal <dig> gene were amplified  using dna from the m <dig> population. during degradation with the adapted masscleave™ method before the maldi-tof fragment separation,  <dig> bp from ascslf <dig> and  <dig> bp from aspal <dig> were in practice lost as some of the generated fragments became too short or too long to resolve satisfactorily in the ms. in total,  <dig> lines were analysed for mutations in the ascslf <dig> gene and  <dig> lines for mutations in the aspal <dig> gene. this covered  <dig> kb of the ascslf <dig> sequences and  <dig> kb of aspal <dig> sequences. the screenings yielded  <dig> ascslf <dig> mutations and  <dig> aspal <dig> mutations, indicating a mutation frequency of one mutation in  <dig> kb and one mutation in  <dig>  kb, respectively. the entire gene fragments from all identified mutants were dna sequenced and the mutants confirmed.

confirmation of maldi-tof screening by dna sequencing
to estimate the predictive abilities of the maldi-tof screening method, using the aspal <dig> gene,  <dig> of the lines that were screened with maldi-tof were subjected to dna sequencing, adding to  <dig> kb. this not only confirmed the four aspal <dig> mutations that were previously identified but also showed that there were no other mutations that went undetected by the maldi-tof screening. therefore it seems like the maldi-tof assay is sensitive enough to detect most mutations in a given sequence and that the background noise is low.

identification of mutations directly by dna sequencing
since the mutation frequency seemed to be high, we attempted to identify mutations directly by dna sequencing. using the ascslf <dig> specific gene primers we amplified and sequenced the  <dig> bp fragment from  <dig> different lines, covering a total of  <dig> kb. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> additional ascslf <dig> mutations, corresponding to one mutation per  <dig>  kb.

characterisation of identified mutations
in the aspal <dig> sequence, four c to t and two g to a transitions were found. three of these mutations were located in the wobbling base and therefore silent, but  <dig> led to an amino acid change. these mutations were evaluated by sift   <cit>  and pssm   <cit>  scores. of the ten mutations found in ascslf <dig>  five created silent mutations and five corresponded to amino acid changes. of these, four were g to a transitions and one an a to t transversion. the obtained pssm scores of these mutations were not significant and thus it's unlikely that the identified mutations may cause any phenotypic changes. for further details see table  <dig> 

*gene: the genes screened for; type: detected mutation; amino acid: the predicted amino acid change in the protein; position: position of the changed amino acid in the protein; pssm and sift: significance of change in the amino acids; method: "maldi-tof and sequencing" indicates that the same mutation was identified by both maldi-tof and dna sequencing. other mutants were either identified by maldi-tof or by dna sequencing, as indicated.

discussion
tilling is a good alternative to more direct dna modifying techniques since seed mutagenesis is easy to apply and relatively independent of genome size and organization  <cit> . to determine the feasibility of developing an oat tilling population initial experiments were performed to find an optimal balance between mutation frequency and lethality. since the oat genome size is very large, it is crucial that the mutation frequency in the final tilling-population is high. our aim was to produce a population where mutations in all genes can be found with a high redundancy without having to produce a very large population size, which requires more advanced logistics in handling and maintenance. screening large populations also becomes laborious, expensive and technically more demanding. on the other hand, a too high mutation frequency will increase the frequency of deleterious mutations, which if too numerous will kill the plant. after testing different ems concentrations we settled for  <dig> %  or  <dig>  mm, which gave a germination rate of 37%. this ems concentration is in the range of what has been used for wheat   <cit>  and maize   <cit> , whereas for barley three different concentrations were used   <cit> . the concentration used for rice was much higher   <cit> .

in avena four genomes, denoted a, b, c and d, have been identified. in nature,  <dig> different combinations of these genomes, namely aa, cc, aabb, aacc and aaccdd can be found  <cit> . belinda, like other commonly cultivated a. sativa species, is a natural allo-hexaploid that contains three genomes aa, cc and dd. such a redundant genomic organization could be a potential complication when identifying specific phenotypes from the tilling-population. the presence of a specific allele on all three genomes would mean that even if one is mutated other alleles could compensate for the lost function. however, as has been shown in hexaploid wheat, the three genomes often contribute differently to the expression of certain alleles, which also can also vary even in different tissues of the plant  <cit> . when inspecting the oat m <dig> segregating tilling-population visible phenotypes were indeed observed in about 5% of the plants . this is surprisingly high considering that in wheat visible phenotypes were seen in only  <dig> % of the cases  <cit> . to extend the resolution of the phenotypic observations we therefore decided to test a specific biochemical pathway.

we stained individual m <dig> seeds from  <dig> randomly chosen individual lines with phloroglucinol-hci   <cit> . this test is generally considered to be indicative of aldehyde end groups present in, for example cinnamyl aldehydes and is thus indicative of lignin content and/or structure  <cit> . the wiesner test revealed differences in the staining pattern in approximately 1% of the screened seeds. again, this is a surprisingly high frequency, which corroborated the phenotypic observations. to verify this, total lignin in seeds from the mutant lines were quantified with the acetyl bromide method. in this assay, bromine replacement of α-carbon-oh groups produce a brown-red colored complex, which is dissolved in acetic acid. the intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of lignin  <cit> . the assay confirmed all  <dig> of the earlier identified mutants . since it is not likely that independent mutations have simultaneously occurred in the same lignin gene in all of the three oat genomes, this indicates that at least some mutations are dominant in a way that is normally seen in a diploid plant. more studies are needed to determine if oat is different from wheat in this respect.

to test the mutation frequency more directly on the dna level, two different approaches were used - rapd and maldi-tof. one was more generally aimed at the whole genome, while the other was directed at specific genes.

by optimising a rapd-pcr based method for oat genomic dna the average mutation frequency for the whole genome was calculated. an advantage with this method is that it is relatively fast and simple. when analysing dna samples from  <dig> different lines,  <dig> abnormal electrophoresis patterns were found, corresponding to a mutation frequency of approximately  <dig> per  <dig> kb  assuming that only a single bp is sufficient to prevent primer binding. however, this might not always be the case and therefore the calculated mutation frequency will rather underestimate than overestimate the true frequency.

to compare the genome wide mutation frequency to the frequency in specific genes, two different genes, each encoding characteristics important for oat breeders, were chosen as models. the first gene, aspal <dig>  encodes a protein that catalyses the first step of the phenyl-propanoid pathway  <cit> . the second gene, ascslf <dig>  encodes an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of mixed link 1- <dig>  1- <dig> β-d-glucans . β-glucans are water-soluble fibres common in the cell wall of the poaceae family and are synthesised by one or several members of a very large cellulose synthase superfamily, from which the cslc, cslh and cslf genes seem to be most relevant  <cit> . these two genes were screened for mutations by maldi-tof.

by adapting a maldi-tof based snp screening method to oat tilling, and by direct dna sequencing, mutations for the two target genes were identified. in total  <dig> kb were covered and  <dig> mutations were found , giving an average mutation frequency of  <dig> per  <dig>  kb. this discrepancy from the rapd-pcr estimation could reflect the fact that, in contrast to the genome wide estimate where local differences are evened out, factors such as chromosomal location, degree of closed or open chromatin, gene redundancy level etc., can influence the result when focusing on more specific regions. additional investigations are therefore needed to explain more precisely why the mutation frequency in the chosen genes appears to be lower than the general frequency.

overall, the mutation frequency in the oat tilling-population thus appears to be in the same range as previously found in hexaploid wheat   <cit> . this is much higher than what was described in barley   <cit> , maize   <cit> , rice   <cit>  and other dicots  <cit> . the specific reasons for these differences are not yet known, but presumably larger polyploid genomes like oat and wheat can tolerate more mutations before lethality occurs.

successful tilling not only depends on the population size and the mutation frequency, the method used to identify specific mutations in the population is equally important. this is especially a concern with a large, hexaploid genome like oat. up to now, all, published high-throughput tilling procedures have utilized a cel i based mismatch-cleavage enzyme on heteroduplex formations followed by a detection of end-labeled cleavage products on electrophoretic gels  <cit> . on the other hand maldi-tof based methods to identify snp-mutations also have an inherent capacity to combine straightforward sample preparation with high sensitivity and high-throughput and are well documented, especially in clinical applications  <cit> . however, to our knowledge maldi-tof methods have not been systematically exploited in tilling. one drawback with current maldi-methods is their reliance on specialised equipment and software for identifying the mutations. another potential problem for large scale screening programs is the high costs of the chemicals needed. on the other hand, ms based methods are sensitive, robust and reliable, which minimise redundant experiments and reduce the cost. they also allow the identification of homozygous mutations. in addition, using several alternative cleavage patterns from the same sample, mutations can be pinpointed down to the single bp level, potentially eliminating the need for confirmative dna sequencing.

thus, the maldi-tof method used here indeed detected mutations with an, up until now, 100% precision. the final percentage is likely to decrease somewhat as sample size increases. in any case, maldi-tof will be good complement or possibly an alternative to cel i/li-cor-screening provided that the per-sample cost could be brought down to an acceptable level and throughput increased. without automation, maldi-screening is still a low throughput method only allowing one person to screen approximately  <dig> samples per week, assuming 8-hour workdays. we are currently in the process of optimising and automating the protocol for large-scale screening.

a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum of mutations generated by ems in arabidopsis was published in  <dig>  <cit> . it was shown that about 50% of all mutations were missense mutations that altered an amino acid, while approximately 5% of the mutations were nonsense resulting in premature termination of the target protein. furthermore, in arabidopsis, maize and wheat the majority of all mutations were the expected gc to at transitions  <cit> . in rice on the other hand, this distribution was somewhat different and only 70% of recorded mutations were gc to at  <cit> . in oat, we have so far identified  <dig> mutations, out of which  <dig> were gc to at transitions . thus, oat seems to be similar to wheat in this respect. most mutations were missense and silent. so far no nonsense mutation have been found . we did not find any examples of small deletions or other rearrangements either, which indicates that the ems mutagenesis worked as expected.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a tilling population of  <dig> mutant lines containing a high frequency of mutations is presented. in combination with a high precision and efficient screening method, it is realistic to assume that productive mutations in all alleles in any gene of interest will eventually be identified. since the genetic basis of a particular mutation then will be known, by repeated back crosses  especially productive mutations can be introduced to any chosen oat variety by marker assisted selection while the majority of the other mutations will be eliminated in the same process. useful mutations in different alleles can also be crossed together. the oat tilling population will be deposited in nordgen http://www.nordgen.org as m <dig> seeds and will be available for academic purposes as soon as the population has been propagated. additionally, a mutation-detection and screening service will be available to the scientific community for academic research through the company croptailor ab http://www.croptailor.com.
