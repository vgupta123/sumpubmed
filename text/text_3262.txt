BACKGROUND
renowned for their fast growth, valuable wood properties and wide adaptability, eucalyptus species are among the most planted hardwoods in the world. the genus eucalyptus includes over  <dig> species  <cit> , including the most planted species e. grandis and e. urophylla , e. globulus  and e. camaldulensis , all belonging to the subgenus symphyomyrtus. native to australia, these fast growing trees were rapidly introduced into india, france, chile, brazil, south africa, and portugal in the first quarter of the  <dig> s  <cit>  and were promptly adopted for plantation forestry. nowadays, eucalyptus and their hybrids are among the world's leading sources of woody biomass and are the main hardwoods used for pulpwood and timber. in particular, e. grandis is grown in tropical and subtropical regions and e. globulus in limited temperate regions of the world while their hybrids are among the most widely used for industrial plantations because of their rapid growth rate, their adaptability to diverse ecological conditions and their good quality wood fiber.

because of their high commercial value, eucalyptus species are major targets for genetic improvement. nevertheless from a genetics perspective, eucalyptus are still in the early stages of domestication when compared to crop species and this fact has important implications when applying genomics approaches to understand the structural and functional biology of the genome  <cit> .

in the last  <dig> years, several studies have led to a better understanding of the eucalyptus genome and the development of an important set of genetic/genomic tools, which can be used to enhance future breeding efforts. eucalyptus sp. are diploid plants with a haploid chromosome number of  <dig>  <cit> . grattapaglia and bradshaw  <cit>  estimated the haploid genome size of eucalyptus species to range ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million base pairs , with the symphyomyrtus species having on average a haploid genome size of  <dig> mbp. the high level of genetic diversity, the ability to generate large progeny sets, the relatively small genome size and low proportion of repetitive dna facilitated genetic linkage mapping in eucalyptus  <cit> . most eucalyptus linkage maps  <cit> , have been constructed from highly heterozygous parents and segregating half-sib of full-sib families, with progenies up to  <dig> individuals often from different species. the development of co-dominant markers such as microsatellites allowed comparative mapping studies among eucalyptus species. extensive map synteny and co linearity were detected between species of the subgenus symphomyrtus  <cit> . qtl mapping in eucalyptus has been applied to the identification of genetic loci associated with variation in biomass productivity, stem form, wood properties , vegetative propagation, biotic/abiotic stress responses, development, foliar chemistry, inbreeding depression, and transcript level  <cit> . expressed sequence tag  catalogues are available  <cit>  and private consortia generated thousands of other ests. the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome from e. globulus is also available  <cit> , and is similar to other angiosperms, with an inverted repeat  separated by a large single copy  region, and a small single copy  region.

currently in progress, the first draft of a whole genome shotgun assembly of the eucalyptus genome  is expected to be publicly available by mid  <dig>  this effort will represent a major achievement and can be used as the first eucalyptus reference sequence for future genomic undertakings  <cit> .

bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries have served as an essential genomic tool to enable positional cloning of important traits, synteny evaluation, and the development of genome framework physical maps for genetic linkage and genome sequencing  <cit> . a number of bac libraries have been reported for woody plants, including forest trees such as liriodendron tulipifera  <cit> , pinus pinaster  <cit> , populus trichocarpa  <cit>  and p. tremuloides  <cit> . the first e. grandis bac library was built in brazil in the context of the genolyptus project, supplying full genomic clones of key genes as well as end-sequences used to derive microsatellite and sts markers to help anchoring selected bac clones to the existing linkage maps  <cit> . unfortunately, due to intellectual property restrictions, this library in not publicly available and no detailed report has been published yet about this specific work.

in this study, we report the construction and characterization of two deep-coverage bac libraries  from e. grandis  whose genome is currently being sequenced, becoming the public reference genome for the genus eucalyptus http://www.eucagen.org. the libraries described here i.e. eg_ba  and eg_bb library , are the first large-insert dna libraries publicly available for genus eucalyptus http://www.genome.arizona.edu/orders/. the roche gs flx technology was successfully used to sequence five bac clones allowing us to report here the whole sequence of the e. grandis chloroplast genome as well as the genomic sequences of important lignin biosynthetic genes.

RESULTS
bac library characterization
two genomic bac libraries  were constructed using partially digested  and size-selected nuclear dna isolated from e. grandis  and the pagibac <dig> cloning vector, as described in materials and methods. two libraries were constructed, using different restriction enzymes to avoid a biased distribution of clones along the eucalyptus genome  <cit> . each library, eg_ba  and eg_bb , contains  <dig>  robotically picked clones arrayed into  <dig> 384-well microtiter plates.

to evaluate the average insert size of each library, bac dna was isolated about  <dig> randomly selected clones from each library, restriction enzyme digested with the rare cutter noti, and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis . all fragments generated by noti digestion contained the  <dig>  kb vector band and various insert fragments . analysis of the insert sizes from the eg_ba library showed that more than 87% of the library contained inserts > <dig> kb while the average insert size was  <dig> kb . analysis of the insert sizes from the eg_bb library showed that more than 89% of the library contained inserts > <dig> kb while the average insert size was  <dig> kb . since the haploid genome of e. grandis is about  <dig> mb, the library coverage is predicted to be  <dig> and  <dig> haploid genome equivalents for the eg_ba and eg_bb libraries, respectively: large large enough coverage to ensure these libraries will be useful for positional cloning, physical mapping and genome sequencing  <cit> . the estimated probability of finding any specific sequence is greater than  <dig> % considering both libraries together  <cit> .

bac library screening
to characterize these bac libraries and facilitate clone identification, we prepared high-density macroarrays on nylon filters from a subset of the libraries representing  <dig> × and  <dig> × of genome coverage for eg_ba and eg_bb libraries, respectively. membranes were hybridized with a series of pooled probes representing the chloroplast and mitochondria genome as well as with probes derived from lignin biosynthesis related genes.

contamination with extranuclear genomes was estimated at  <dig> % of the total number of bac clones in both libraries. bac clones containing e. grandis chloroplast sequences represented about  <dig> % of all bac clones in both libraries, lower than the estimates for several other plant species libraries  <cit> . the mitochondrial genome was represented by  <dig> % of our bac clones; slightly higher as compared to the  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % found in coffee  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , and banana  <cit>  bac libraries, respectively.

to evaluate the potential of these two bac libraries to supply genomic sequences to contain candidate genes for cell wall biosynthesis, we screened the libraries with cdna probes for lignin biosynthesis genes,  <cit>  and regulatory genes   <cit> . an average of  <dig>  positive clones  was obtained when the eg_ba library was screened with probes derived from the following genes: egucad <dig> , eguccoaomt , eguccr <dig> , eguf <dig> h , eguhct , egumyb <dig>  and egupal . an average of  <dig>  positive clones was obtained by probing the eg_bb macroarray against egu4cl , eguc <dig> h , eguc <dig> h , egumyb <dig> , egucomt  and egurac <dig>  genes. the results of the macroarray hybridization gene screening suggest an over-representation of positive clones for cad <dig>  ccoaomt, comt and rac genes. however, the probes used in the macroarray hybridizations were relatively long allowing the possibility of cross-hybridization with other members of multigene families.

screening was made on subsets of eg_ba and eg_bb bac libraries with redundant genome coverage of  <dig> × and  <dig> ×, respectively. number of positive clones obtained  and validated by pcr .

to remove false positives and target a single genetic locus, we performed an additional confirmation by pcr, using specific primer pairs designed from available e. gunnii available cdna sequences. on average, the estimated proportions of 62% and 57% of the hybridization positive clones were confirmed by pcr screening for the eg_ba and eg_bb libraries, respectively .

the results of the hybridization experiments compared to those obtained by pcr validation suggest that these genes may be present in duplicate or belong to multigene families present in the eucalyptus genome, in agreement with the est analysis of rengel et al.  <cit>  that found different unigene members for some of these genes.

sequencing of selected bac clones
five bac clones were selected, sequenced and assembled with roche gs flx sequencing, and newbler assembly methodology, respectively . they included one bac clone containing the chloroplast genome , one bac clone randomly selected from the eg_ba library , and three bac clones  that were hybridization positive for three genes of interest - eguccr, egucad <dig> and egurac <dig> - respectively.

the shotgun sequencing of these bac clones produced on average  <dig>  high quality reads per clone sequenced with a mean read length of 261nt. these clones were sequenced to different levels of sequence coverage ranging from  <dig> × to  <dig> ×.

on average 98% of these reads were used to assemble the full sequences of each clone into a minimum of five and a maximum of  <dig> contigs, for eg_ba_35h <dig> and eg_ba_18g <dig>  respectively. the number of large contigs  varied among clones from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these contigs were then reassembled into one  to six  scaffolds, allowing the reconstruction of the full sequence of all bac clones except clone eg_bb_94g <dig> . in this latter case, the presence of repetitive sequences prevented our ability to order and orient four of the six. such a problem was already reported in barley by wicker et al.  <cit> . despite the relatively restricted number of clones sequenced, our results suggest the feasibility of using  <dig> sequencing for rapid and cost-effective sequencing and assembly of eucalyptus bac clones. the increased length of the  <dig> reads currently achievable with the titanium chemistry  should result in regions of high-quality finished genomic sequences. bac clone sequences were deposited into genbank .

characterization of genomic nuclear bac clone sequences
repeatmasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/ was used to estimate gc content and search for interspersed repeats and low complexity dna sequences in the four bac sequences . the four bac clone sequences revealed a low number of transposable elements, and low percentage of low complexity sequences  when compared to  <dig> to 35% in other plant genomes analyzed . however, these estimates cannot be generalized to the entire e. grandis genome due to the small number of bac clones analyzed as well as the ascertainment bias resulting from the selection of gene-containing bacs. furthermore, it is known that the distribution of these repetitive elements vary along the genomes. indeed, clone eg_ba_2b <dig> presented the lowest repeat content  while the highest levels were found for clones eg_bb_94g <dig>  and clone eg_ba_11k <dig> . six putative retroelements were found within the scaffold sequences of clone eg_ba_18g <dig>  whereas none were identified in clone eg_ba_2b <dig>  four ltr class retroelements were found within the scaffold sequences of clone eg_bb_94g <dig>  and eg_ba_11k <dig> . low complexity sequences covered  <dig> %, to  <dig> % of the bac clones sequence scaffolds analysed

using sputnik  a total of  <dig> microsatellites also called simple sequence repeats  were found within the bac scaffold sequences and these can be developed as new genetic markers. ssr markers have been extensively used in linkage analysis and comparative mapping of eucalyptus species <cit> , genetic fingerprinting  <cit> , population genetics  <cit> , and for clonal fidelity assessment  <cit> . one possible application of these new bac-derived genetic markers could be the anchoring of a physical map to the available eucalyptus genetic maps. within the bac clone sequence scaffolds we found  <dig> perfect class i ssrs, that are more likely to be polymorphic  <cit>  as ssr mutations tend to be positively correlated with ssr length  <cit> . this class of ssrs was found to occur on average every  <dig>  kb within the sequences of the four nuclear bac clones sequenced, from a minimum of  <dig>  kb  to  <dig>  kb . these differences could reflect the non-random distribution of ssr in plant genomes  <cit> . the frequency of classi ssrs observed in this study was similar to that observed by mun et al.  <cit>  for selected medicago truncatula bac clone sequences, but very low when compared to that observed in another tree species populus, where ssrs occurred on average every  <dig>  kb  <cit> . however, one cannot discard the possibility that the existence of gaps generated by the presence of repetitive sequences, where  <dig> sequencing has trouble going through, and/or due to a low sequence coverage in the region, might potentially underestimate the ssr frequency. furthermore, the frequency of ssrs within the bac clones is also very low when compared to that observed by ceresini et al.  <cit> ) and rabello et al.  <cit>  that reported a frequency of one class i ssr every  <dig> - <dig>  kb in eucalyptus cdna libraries.

comparison of the structure and sequence of the ccr and cad <dig> genes from e. grandis and e. gunnii
cinnamoyl coa reductase , that catalyzes the conversion of cinnamoyl coa esters to their corresponding cinnamaldehydes and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  that catalyzes the conversion of these aldehydes to the corresponding alcohols are considered key enzymes in lignin biosynthesis. for instance, it was previously found that ccr down-regulated plants had lower lignin levels than controls  <cit>  and the extractability of the lignin polymer was improved in cad down-regulated plants  <cit> . sequences of positive bac clones for cad and ccr probes were analyzed for gene identification via homology searches. searches with blastn performed against a non-redundant databases  allowed us to easily identify the e. grandis homologous genes to the e. gunnii ccr gene  and the cad <dig> gene .

global sequence alignments performed using the needle algorithm included within the emboss package  <cit>  allowed for the calculation of the percent identity between e. grandis and e. gunnii ccr and cad sequences and to compare their intron/exon structure. results of these structural comparisons are schematically presented in figure  <dig>  and revealed that the number of exons, the intron/exon structure and junction boundaries were strictly conserved for both genes in both species. moreover, the sequences are highly conserved particularly in the exons, with identity percentages varying between  <dig> and 100%. it seems that for both genes, the three first exons are slightly more conserved between the two species than the fourth and fifth exons.

non-coding regions were also very well conserved between e. gunnii and e. grandis cad and ccr sequences, respectively. the cad promoter regions exhibited sequence identity of 96% for the first  <dig>  kb. whereas the sequence conservation was lower between the ccr promoter sequences, showing 88% sequence identity within the first  <dig> pb upstream the transcription start. the alignment was interrupted by an insertion of  <dig> bp in the e. grandis sequence and the identity level in the remaining 5' sequence dropped to 85%.

concerning introns, identities between e. grandis and e. gunnii increased from 90% to 97%, the less conserved being intron  <dig>  showing 90% and 93% identity for cad <dig> and ccr respectively. intron  <dig> in the e. grandis cad <dig> gene exhibited a deletion of  <dig> nt after position  <dig> as compared to the corresponding intron in e. gunnii.

the indels, reported here, between the ccr promoters and between introns  <dig> of cad <dig> could be used to develop markers to discriminate these two species, as they seem highly conserved within each species .

the e. grandis chloroplast genome characterization
the large size of e. grandis bac clone inserts coupled with the library screening strategy  allowed for the identification of bac clones with inserts that potentially contained the entire sequence of the e. grandis choloroplast genome. clone eg_ba_35h <dig> was selected for sequencing since this clone was shown to be positive for several chloroplast probes and also presented an insert size close to that of the previously sequence of e. globulus chloroplast genome . the the roche gs flx reads were assembled into four long contigs sharing more than 99% sequence identity with the e. globulus chloroplast genome sequence. due to the presence of inverted repeats  in the e. globulus chloroplast, a manual rearrangement of the sequences was performed based on this reference chloroplast genome  <cit>  which allowed us to obtain a unique continuous fragment with  <dig>  bp , a length that is close to that observed for e. globulus   <cit>  and vitis   <cit>  but larger than the one reported earlier for e. nitens  based on restriction enzyme mapping  <cit> . the chloroplast genome of e. grandis includes a pair of inverted repeats  <dig>  bp long, separated by a small, and large single copy regions of  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the gc-content of the e. grandis chloroplast genome is  <dig> %, which is comparable to that of the e. globulus chloroplast genome and to other tree plant plastids . figure  <dig> illustrates a very high conservation of the chloroplast genomes between the e. grandis and the e. globulus. moreover, the annotation of the e. grandis chloroplast genome sequences reveals that gene order is conserved in the two species. the large size of the inserts in the bac libraries allowed us to obtain the chloroplast genome sequence in one single bac clone. the sequencing of this bac clone with roche gs flx technology was as efficient as the bridging shotgun library strategy used for e. globulus  <cit>  or vitis  <cit>  chloroplast genome sequencing. such an approach could be readily applied to study other non-nuclear genomes, such as mitochondrial genomes. the complete and annotated e. grandis chloroplast genome sequence was deposited into genbank .

CONCLUSIONS
the two eucalyptus bac libraries described in this study represent an important milestone for the advancement of eucalyptus genomics and forest tree research. these bac resources have a highly redundant genome coverage , contain large average inserts  and have a very low percentage of clones with organellar dna or empty vectors. this indicates that these publicly available bac libraries are suitable for a broad range of applications in genetic and genomic research in eucalyptus and possibly in related species of myrtaceae, including genome sequencing, gene isolation, functional and comparative genomics. the analysis of ~ <dig>  mb of bac clone sequences generated by roche gs flx sequencing technology provided an overview of the composition of the eucalyptus nuclear genome and the feasibility of using this high-throughput technology for low-cost and efficient sequencing and assembly of the targeted eucalyptus sequences. ssrs identified within the bac clone sequences could be used to develop new genetic markers for multiple genotyping purposes. in addition, we report the full chloroplast genome sequence of e. grandis  allowing comparison of this genome with e. globulus and other plant species. comparative analysis of the cad <dig> and ccr genes between e. grandis and e. gunnii showed a high conservation of the structure of genes as well as a high identity both in the coding and non coding sequences.
