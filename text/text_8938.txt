BACKGROUND
annual vaccination is the most efficient way to reduce the immense number of 3– <dig> million cases of severe illness or death due to influenza virus infections. different vaccine types have been developed and are being deployed for this purpose over the past 60– <dig> years. the most common type is the trivalent influenza vaccine  derived from inactivated whole virus. tivs are injected intramuscularly or intradermal. they have a favorable safety profile and induce reliable protective immunity against viral strains which are similar to those present in the vaccine. however, because efficacy against new virus variants can be low, the composition of the vaccine has to be carefully predicted for each influenza season  <cit> . another type of influenza vaccines is the live attenuated influenza vaccine  comprising virus strains that are adapted to replication at temperatures below the human body temperature. laivs are administered through a nasal spray mimicking a natural infection of the mucosal cells of the nasopharynx. however, these viruses cannot replicate at non-permissive temperatures present in the lower respiratory tract and lungs. due to the attenuated infection in the upper respiratory tract, these vaccines induce not only strain specific immunity but also t cell responses that may be cross-reactive and thus contribute to protection against a wider spectrum of influenza a and b strains  <cit> . the only approved laivs are flumist®  for the us and russian market and, since  <dig>  the european analogue fluenz®, both produced in an egg-based process  <cit> . as opposed to parenteral inactivated vaccines, the downstream processing requirements are less stringent and thus less expensive for mucosal live virus vaccines. also for this reason, the who encouraged to extend the manufacturing of laivs as part of the global pandemic influenza action plan  <cit> .

production of laivs has so far been investigated in three host systems: chicken eggs  <cit> , adherent mdck  <cit>  or adherent vero cells  <cit> . because properties such as replication kinetics, viral rna synthesis and protein expression appear to be comparable in cell culture- or egg-derived virus strains  <cit> , both have been approved for the production of vaccines for human use. however, there are inherent limitations associated with the process design related to the decision for a specific host system, being more or less pronounced for one or the other. scalability, for example, is impaired significantly for adherent cell lines cultivated in static or microcarrier systems. the use of suspension-adapted cell lines such as mdck and vero could overcome this limitation. these cells have been adapted to growth in suspension by several groups  <cit>  and by the industry where they are already used in vaccine manufacturing  <cit> . other suspension cell lines useful for influenza vaccine production are per.c <dig>  <cit> , hek <dig>  <cit> , eb <dig>  <cit>  or age <dig> cr.pix   <cit> .

the cr.pix cell line has been generated specifically for production of modern vaccines. its derivation and identity is fully documented and genetic stability was shown for at least  <dig> passages  <cit> . as required by regulatory authorities, the absence of adventitious agents was confirmed via extensive testing of cr.pix cell banks by a spectrum of methods such as transmission electron microscopy against microbial structures; diagnostic pcr reactions against specific avian, bovine and porcine agents; in vitro assays with various sentinel cell lines for any cytopathic effects; in vivo assays in different animal species for any signs of infection or induction of antibodies; quantitative fluorescent product enhanced reverse transcriptase  assay and co-cultivation to detect endogenous or exogenous retroviral contamination; and inoculation of cell line material into various agars and broths to test against mycoplasma and other bacteria. with regards to process technology, this cell line proliferates in suspension in a chemically-defined medium and has been shown to support influenza a virus replication. moreover, cr.pix cells are expected to be susceptible for a broad spectrum of virus subtypes and strains as they display both α <dig> - and α <dig> -linked sialic acids as surface membrane receptors  <cit> .

for the design of vaccine production processes using a new host cell, studies concerning crucial infection parameters like trypsin activity and multiplicity of infection  are necessary. in addition, the cell concentration at time of infection  has been reported to be important for adenovirus, baculovirus and influenza virus production  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that above a certain cci, the cell-specific virus productivity drops substantially, what is called the “cell density effect”. all studies related to this topic indicate that the reasons for the cell density effect are highly dependent on the production system  and thus cannot be generalized. explanations for this effect include depletion of nutrients or accumulation of inhibiting substances  <cit> . also, activity or availability of host cell factors required for virus replication may change with the cell cycle  <cit>  or with metabolic shifts  <cit>  at higher cell densities. as an example, for production of influenza virus typically 1-2 ×  <dig> cells/ml are used, but with fed-batch or perfusion strategies exhaustion of medium components and influence of inhibiting substances can be avoided and high-yield infections of 1 ×  <dig> cells/ml have been demonstrated  <cit> . the aim of overcoming the cell density effect is to maintain or even increase the cell-specific productivity in order to improve process productivity, i.e. to increase the vaccine doses which can be harvested per reactor volume.

in this work, we produced human laiv strains in a chemically-defined medium using cr.pix cells. one cold-adapted  influenza a strain , one ca influenza b strain as well as the reference strain a/pr/8/ <dig>  were propagated. after adapting the virus strains to cr.pix cells we confirmed temperature sensitivity and identified best cultivation conditions such as medium supply and trypsin activity for successful infection in small-scale scouting experiments. subsequently, batch bioreactor cultivations were performed to demonstrate that cultures can be productively infected at a cci of 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml without any medium exchange, doubling the cci that has been used previously with cr.pix cells   <cit> . only at higher cci a cell density effect was observed when infecting without a medium exchange. in all experiments, high titers and fast replication dynamics have been achieved demonstrating a chemically-defined suspension production process for influenza laiv strains.

RESULTS
the chemically-defined medium cd-u <dig> supports direct infection
experimental data on influenza virus production in cr.pix cells is available only for cultures in serum-free proliferation medium containing hydrolysates  <cit> . however, to improve proliferation of cr.pix cells and to reduce risk of lot-to-lot inconsistencies due to variable hydrolysate composition, a chemically-defined medium  has been developed specifically for this cell line  <cit> . as a reference for the evaluation of cold-adapted virus propagation, and to test virus stability and the requirement for a medium exchange, replication of the human influenza virus strain h1n <dig> a/pr/8/ <dig> was investigated first. this strain is included regularly in similar studies and titers obtained with cr.pix cells therefore can be compared to other producer cells.

cr.pix cells were infected with a/pr/8/ <dig> without medium exchange, after a partial medium exchange , or after a complete medium exchange. infection took place at a cci of 2 ×  <dig> cells/ml that was reached approximately two days after culture inoculation.

ha yields and tcid <dig> titers differed slightly using the three medium exchange strategies  with a trend towards lower titers when a medium exchange was applied. the ha yield reached a plateau of  <dig> - <dig>  log <dig> ha units/ <dig> μl at  <dig> h post infection  and remained stable until  <dig> hpi . tcid <dig> titers reached a maximum at  <dig> hpi, but were less stable than the ha yield, decreasing about  <dig> log unit in  <dig> h. the maximum tcid <dig> of  <dig>  ×  <dig> virions/ml was obtained in cultures which have been infected directly and lowest tcid <dig> was observed after exchanging half of the growth medium. none of the cultures exhibited limiting substrate levels at time of infection, which was confirmed with metabolite concentration measurements . from these results we concluded that a medium exchange is not required and that cd-u <dig> supports stable ha virus yields and good tcid <dig> titers at a cci of 2 ×  <dig> cells/ml.

temperature sensitivity of laiv strains is maintained after adaptation
influenza virus has a broad host range and can shuttle between mammalian and avian cells. however, virus replication dynamics and maximum titers may be impaired by a sudden shift to a new cell substrate and may be improved by serial passages of the virus in the new host cell line. for this reason, the laiv strains a/singapore and b/vienna  were adapted to cr.pix cells to generate working seed viruses with high titers. at the same time, care was taken to achieve this with a minimum number of passages  to minimize the potential for reversion to replication at non-permissive temperatures.

after adaptation to cr.pix cells, the a/singapore and b/vienna strain had, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> increased maximum tcid <dig> titers. the chosen seed viruses were from passage  <dig> for the a/singapore strain, harvested at  <dig> hpi, and from passage  <dig> for the b/vienna strain, harvested at  <dig> hpi. overall,  <dig>  and  <dig> days  were needed to complete the adaptation to cr.pix cells. the mentioned harvests were used as working seed viruses for all subsequent experiments.

considering temperature sensitivity, we tested replication of both ca strains at 37°c before adaptation to cr.pix cells and could not detect any virus titer, whereas virus propagation was successful at 33°c . to test whether the required temperature sensitivity of laiv strains was still present after the adaptation process, infection experiments were conducted at  <dig>   <dig> and 40°c. the b strain was highly sensitive to non-permissive temperature as no viral activity was determined at 37°c, obviating further examination of replication at 40°c. the a/singapore strain produced about  <dig> times less active virus particles at 37°c compared to 33°c. at 40°c, no active particles were detected. these results indicate that both working virus seeds exhibit the expected temperature sensitivity.

optimization of trypsin activity
laiv strains replicate at 33°c and the activity of trypsin  is expected to be slightly reduced at 33°c  <cit> . to test whether this reduction requires higher amounts of trypsin for propagation of cold-adapted virus strains, we tested different trypsin activities with a/singapore and b/vienna . when using 1 × 10- <dig> units/cell , maximum tcid <dig> values were measured at  <dig> hpi. an increase of the trypsin activity to 5 × 10- <dig> units/cell or even 10 × 10- <dig> units/cell reduced the titers of a/singapore and b/vienna. infections without trypsin addition did not produce any infectious virus particles. thus, without further adaptation of this parameter, 1 × 10- <dig> units trypsin per cell was found to support best the replication of a/singapore  and b/vienna .

cell density effect in bioreactor cultivations
whether the ca strains can be produced in bioreactors is an important test towards suitability of laiv strain production for seasonal or pandemic vaccines in the cr.pix suspension cells. focusing on the a/singapore strain, we therefore performed experiments in a benchtop stirred tank bioreactor system to test the scale-up potential. the cell density effect was evaluated by varying the cell concentration at time of infection with the aim to identify the highest cci that can be used without reduction of cell-specific productivity. one problem for infection at high cci could be the release and accumulation of trypsin inhibitors during the growth phase. we therefore also tested if a higher trypsin activity or a medium feed at high cci can rescue productivity. six bioreactor runs were performed with infections at 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml , 6 ×  <dig> cells/ml  and 8 ×  <dig> cells/ml  . exact cell concentrations together with added trypsin and medium are summarized in table  <dig> 

cr.pix cell cultures were infected at different cci and trypsin activities. upon infection, the temperature was reduced to 33°c for virus propagation.

at the lowest cci , cell-specific virus yields of  <dig>  and  <dig> active virions/cell  were obtained. infection of the intermediate group with a cci of about 6 ×  <dig> cells/ml led to reduced titers  compared to the lowest cci  and, correspondingly, reduced cell-specific productivities . using a high cci of about 8 ×  <dig> cells/ml resulted in titers of 8 ×  <dig> virions/ml and 6 ×  <dig> virions/ml, respectively, and hence also low cell-specific virus yields of  <dig> and  <dig> virions/cell, respectively. this shows that neither the titer nor the productivity was rescued when applying a higher trypsin activity  or a medium addition  at the highest cci. for all cultures, viability at time of infection was above 90% , showing that cells were not impaired due to extension of the growth phase. thus, a cell density effect, i.e. a loss in cell-specific virus productivity, was observed at cci above 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml.

a comparison to shaker flask experiments  confirmed that scale-up to a benchtop bioreactor did not reduce virus titers or productivities at a cci of 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml. from these results we conclude that a cci of up to 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml can be used for virus production without the requirement for a medium exchange and, most importantly, without loss of cell-specific productivity.

discussion
increasing and unmet demand for vaccination against seasonal and pandemic influenza virus is a strong motivation for exploring additional means in vaccine manufacturing. currently, most inactivated and the live attenuated influenza vaccines are manufactured in embryonated chicken eggs, an established technology but associated with demanding logistics, risks of allergic reactions and difficulties in scalability. therefore, some influenza vaccine manufacturers have developed new production processes for influenza vaccines in cell culture , although laivs are still exclusively produced in eggs  <cit> . in particular, the use of continuous cell lines adapted to growth in suspension has the potential for large scale production in closed systems using a comparatively simple generic process. we therefore investigated replication of influenza virus in the cr.pix cell line, which is specifically created and designed for vaccine manufacture and is adapted to proliferate in chemically-defined media. generally, cr.pix cells show a good proliferation performance with growth rates in the range of  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig> . after seven days, approximately 1 ×  <dig> cells/ml can be achieved in batch cultivation. in conjunction with a well-balanced medium , this leads to a short growth phase so that infections can be initiated soon after inoculation.

in the first part of our study we demonstrate that cr.pix cells can produce influenza virus to high titers in shaker flasks. for the reference strain a/pr/8/ <dig>  tcid <dig> titers of  <dig>  ×  <dig> virions/ml were achieved, which is in a similar range  reported for other cell lines  <cit> . the achieved ha titers  are about  <dig>  log ha units/ <dig> μl which is slightly lower than those normally obtained with conventional cells  or new candidate cell lines . mostly, these are reported to propagate the a/pr/8/ <dig> influenza virus strain to titers of  <dig>  to  <dig>  log ha units/ <dig> μl  <cit> . generally, cr.pix cells seem to generate the same tcid <dig> titers, but slightly lower ha titers and thus should in particular be considered for the production of laiv strains. with a medium replacement at time of infection, we could not observe a titer increase and thus we conclude that a process without any medium exchange is possible in this system, a property which substantially simplifies a suspension process at industrial scales.

laiv strains must have a temperature-sensitive and cold-adapted phenotype in order to be considered safe for use in human vaccination. thus, we tested temperature sensitivity after adapting the ca strains to cr.pix cells. the b/vienna strain showed to be temperature-sensitive as no active virions were produced at 37°c. the titer of a/singapore was reduced about  <dig>  log at 37°c compared to 33°c . this reduction is not as clear as for the b strain but expected from previous studies as the replication deficiency must be obvious only at  <dig> or 40°c for a strains  <cit> . other studies have demonstrated a titer reduction of 20% at 37°c compared to the titer at 33°c  <cit>  and of  <dig> log units for the master donor strain b/annarbor/1/ <dig> strain  <cit> . this range was also observed here. testing the temperature sensitivity before and after adaptation to cr.pix cells  confirmed the temperature-sensitive phenotype. both ca strains were pheno- and genotypically characterized for patent registration before reassortment and adaptation to cr.pix cells  <cit> , and it was shown that both cold-adapted strains carry several mutations compared to the wild type strains. for the a/singapore strain there were  <dig> mutations with  <dig> of them coding for an amino acid exchange. for the b/vienna strain  <dig> mutations were detected by sequencing with  <dig> of them coding for an amino acid exchange. generally, sequencing of both strains could be of interest for follow-up studies considering mutations that occur during adaptation to the host cell line cr.pix and considering the presence of mutations that might be connected with the temperature-sensitive phenotype  <cit> .

it is known that for optimal influenza virus replication trypsin addition is crucial. the selection of the trypsin activity depends on the cell line , the medium , and also the virus strain  <cit> . here, for both laiv strains we tested  <dig> different concentrations to identify an optimal trypsin activity and found 1 × 10- <dig> units/cell to result in highest titers. the reduced temperature of 33°c did not have an effect on the optimal trypsin concentration due to an only slightly impaired enzyme activity at this temperature  <cit> . however, a design of experiment approach considering trypsin activity and other parameters would be useful for further process optimization  <cit> . shaker flask experiments were found to be highly predictive and scale-up to stirred tank bioreactors was possible without further optimization and without loss of productivity. particularly this easy scale-up provides higher flexibility compared to eggs or adherent cells.

a cell density effect, i.e. reduced titers and productivities at high cci, as described for hek <dig> cells and insect sf <dig> cells infected with adenovirus, influenza virus and baculovirus  <cit> , was also observed with influenza virus-infected cr.pix cells. at cci above a critical concentration of 4 ×  <dig> cells/ml, cell-specific virus productivity decreased. the same critical cell concentration  was also found in studies using a/pr/8/34-infected hek <dig> cells  <cit> . influenza virus replication is known to modulate the cell cycle to include the cellular environment for replication  <cit> . we have observed previously that the cell cycle fractions of a cr.pix population at 8 ×  <dig> cells/ml  do not differ significantly from the fractions at 2 ×  <dig> cells/ml, which corresponds to about three days growth . for this reason, we focused on medium limitations as a cause for the cell density effect. addition of a 10-fold higher trypsin activity suggests that impaired virus propagation was not due to trypsin inhibitors released by the cells during the growth phase. furthermore, the depletion of a common medium component also appears unlikely as a medium feed could not rescue virus titers or cell-specific productivities. supporting this observation, neither the concentrations of the tested amino acids nor metabolites such as glucose or pyruvate appeared to be limiting . still, we cannot rule out that the accumulation of more elusive medium compounds  may be responsible. thus, at this moment we speculate that accumulation of inhibiting substances  may cause the cell density effect. this hypothesis is currently tested in perfusion cultivations where cells are infected at very high cell concentrations. future studies will also investigate modification of the medium  to increase not only virus titers and productivity but also the critical cci.

our results show that the ca strain a/singapore can replicate to 1 ×  <dig> virions/ml in a cr.pix cell-based process. this corresponds to approximately  <dig> vaccine doses per liter reactor volume assuming that one dose contains  <dig> active virus particles . romanova et al. obtained 2 ×  <dig> pfu/ml with the same master donor strain  using adherent vero cells  <cit> . with adherent mdck cells, titers for the related strain a/newcaledonia/20/ <dig> of up to  <dig> ffu/ml have been reported  <cit> . several influenza b strains were also tested in those studies and were produced to titers of  <dig> to  <dig> virions/ml. as it is generally known that achievable titers are strain-specific, extensive optimizations normally help to maximize titers for each strain. aggarwal et al. and george et al. have shown in their studies that high titers for b strains can be achieved after extensive optimization of moi, microcarrier concentration, agitation rate and cci  <cit> . thus, we are confident that additional optimization of cr.pix cell-based processes  can further improve the propagation of the tested b/vienna strain.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides preliminary evidence for the potential for production of laiv to high titers in a suspension process with an avian cell line. this process is fast with peak titers already  <dig> h post infection and easily scalable to industrial volumes as neither addition of microcarriers nor medium replacements are required. the use of an avian cell line designed specifically for vaccine production and a chemically-defined medium should facilitate regulatory approval. optimization of medium, feeding or perfusion strategy and process parameters will be pursued to achieve a further increase in cci and improvement of virus titers.
