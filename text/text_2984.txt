BACKGROUND
hc <dig> mouse mammary epithelial cells have been widely used as an in vitro model of mammary gland epithelial cell differentiation. the hc <dig> cell line preserves important features of mammary epithelial cell lactogenic differentiation; it was clonally derived from the comma-1d cells, a line immortalized from mammary tissue of a pregnant balb/c mouse  <cit> . the hc <dig> cells are non-tumorigenic, display a normal epithelial phenotype, and the injection of hc <dig> cells into the cleared fat pad of balb/c mice exhibited normal ductal and alveolar-like structures  <cit> . hc <dig> mammary epithelial cell lactogenic differentiation can be initiated in culture following the growth to confluence and deposition of extracellular matrix in the presence of epidermal growth factor , subsequent removal of egf from the culture and the addition of lactogenic hormone mix, dip ; upon differentiation hc <dig> cells express specific milk proteins including β-casein  <cit> . moreover, during lactogenic differentiation in culture the hc <dig> cells undergo phenotypic transformation to "mammospheres", enlarged domed structures with a lumen  <cit> .

hc <dig> cells express receptor tyrosine kinases of various subclasses  <cit> , and the addition of specific mitogens e.g. egf or the presence of oncogenes, including activated ras, inhibit lactogenic differentiation  <cit> . several signaling mechanisms have been shown to facilitate the egf-induced block of lactogenic differentiation. the two key pathways implicated in hc <dig> cells are ras/raf/mek/erk and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  pathways  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated that dn-ras expression blocked egf-induced inhibition of hc <dig> cell lactogenic differentiation via inhibition of raf/mek/erk signaling and enhanced stat <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . however, the activation of pi-3-kinase by egf was largely independent of ras in these cells, but it did contribute to inhibition of lactogenesis.

the pi-3-kinases are a ubiquitously expressed lipid kinase family that plays a key role in cellular proliferation, growth and survival. pi-3-kinase was initially purified and cloned as a heterodimeric complex consisting of an  <dig> kda catalytic subunit and an  <dig> kda regulatory/adaptor subunit  <cit> . recent reviews of the pi-3-kinase pathway describe its activation and activity  <cit> . the class i pi-3-kinases  <cit>  are activated following either binding of the p <dig> subunit to activated ras  <cit>  or binding of the sh <dig> domains of the p <dig> adaptor protein to phosphotyrosine residues of the egf receptor  <cit> . pi-3-kinase translocates from the cytosol to the membrane where it phosphorylates the 3'-oh position of the inositol ring of substrates including phosphatidylinositol- <dig>  5-bisphosphate. this phosphorylation directs the membrane localization of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  <dig>  through its pleckstrin homology  domain resulting in the autophosphorylation of pdk <dig> and phosphorylation of akt at thr  <dig>  maximal activation of akt kinase activity requires ser  <dig> phosphorylation by a kinase that has yet to be completely characterized and is referred to as pdk <dig>  <cit> . there are numerous known akt substrates including gsk3β, fkhr <dig> and ikk, and akt controls aspects of cell survival as well as cell growth and division by phosphorylating these key regulators  <cit> .

the activation of akt can link mitogenic signaling with nutrient sensing pathways that regulate protein synthesis and cell size via a pathway that includes tsc2/tuberin, the gtpase rheb and the serine-threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin, mtor  <cit> . the activation of mtor leads to mtor-initiated phosphorylation of the translation regulators p70s <dig> kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e binding protein  <dig>   <cit> .

the pi-3-kinase and akt signal transduction pathway contributes to mammary carcinogenesis and resistance of tumors to chemotherapy as a result of mutation and amplification of component members  <cit> . in addition, the control of akt activity is important in maintaining normal polarized mammary architecture  <cit> . hence, we examined the importance of the pi-3-kinase pathway in hc <dig> undergoing lactogenic differentiation. we determined that ectopic expression of conditionally active-akt blocks lactogenic differentiation and that inhibiting pi-3-kinase, akt, or mtor rescues the egf-induced block of lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells. our data indicate that egf stimulation activates akt and subsequently p70s <dig> kinase, rps <dig>  eif4e and 4e-bp <dig> via pi-3-kinase/akt dependent mechanisms in hc <dig> cells. therefore, activation of pi-3-kinase in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells may regulate changes in translational control of proteins that influence the ability of lactogenic hormone to induce differentiation.

RESULTS
egf blocks hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation via mek/erk and pi-3-k dependent pathways
recent publications from our lab and others  <cit>  suggest that pi-3-kinase plays a key role in mammary epithelial cell lactogenic differentiation. the present study addresses the mechanism by which pi-3-kinase blocks hc <dig> mammary epithelial cell lactogenic differentiation. several parameters defining hc <dig> mammary epithelial cell differentiation were examined to follow the effects of signal transduction pathways on the differentiation process. the markers include β-casein synthesis and mammosphere formation  <cit> . two related cell lines were employed in the study: hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells and hc11-luci cells which contain a luciferase gene under the control of a β-casein promotor.

egf stimulation of hc <dig> cells activates pi-3-kinase signaling as well as other pathways, and the results from our previous study determined that egf blocked activation of a β-casein promotor-luciferase activity following induction of lactogenic differentiation via both mek/erk and pi-3-kinase dependent mechanisms  <cit> . the results in figure  <dig> confirm and expand those findings using an inhibitor of pi-3-kinase activity. β-casein rna transcription was examined by northern blotting following stimulation of hc <dig> cells with the lactogenic hormone mix, dip, in the presence and absence of egf and ly <dig>  egf blocked lactogenic hormone induced β-casein transcription and the addition of the pi-3-kinase inhibitor, ly <dig>  partially rescued β-casein transcription . however, the addition of pi-3-kinase inhibitors ly <dig> or wortmannin in the absence of egf reduced all markers of lactogenic differentiation , indicating that survival signaling from this pathway was essential for hc <dig> differentiation to proceed.

mammosphere formation is another important marker of hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation. hc <dig> cells were induced to differentiate in dip-induction media with or without egf and ly <dig>  the cells were observed and photographed at  <dig> hours post-induction. egf blocked the formation of mammospheres and ly <dig> rescued the egf block of mammosphere formation . this suggested that pi-3-kinase activation was an important component in the egf-induced block of phenotypic lactogenic differentiation.

constitutive activation of akt- <dig> blocks lactogenic differentiation and the expression of dominant negative-akt enhances differentiation in hc <dig> cells
the activation of akt is a major outcome of pi-3-kinase stimulation. hence, the role of akt in regulating hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation was examined. transient transfection of a plasmid encoding a ha-tagged conditionally active-akt- <dig>  gene was used to assess the ability of the activated akt pathway to block lactogenic differentiation via inhibition of β-casein promotor luciferase activity  <cit> . hc11-luci cells were transiently transfected with either a plasmid encoding a ha-tagged conditionally active-akt <dig> or a control vector. western blotting of transfected cell lysates revealed that the ha-tagged conditionally active-akt <dig> was expressed at levels equal to the endogenous akt protein . the cells were induced to differentiate with dip in the presence of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen to activate the ha-tagged conditionally active-akt <dig>  and luciferase activity was determined  <dig> hours after induction. expression of the conditionally active-akt <dig> significantly decreased luciferase activity compared to the control vector and the addition of tamoxifen slightly reduced the luciferase activity in ca-akt <dig> transfected cells . this indicated that the ca-akt <dig> was not completely responsive to 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen under these conditions but that there was sufficient activity from the protein to activate pi-3-kinase signaling above that in control cells. the results in figure 4d confirm elevated activation of the pathway.

infection with a replication defective adenovirus encoding a dominant negative-akt <dig>  containing mutations at both the active site and regulatory serine phosphorylation sites  <cit>  was used to further assess the role of the akt pathway in blocking lactogenic differentiation. hc <dig> and hc11-luci cells were grown to 90% confluence and infected with a dominant negative-akt <dig> or a control adenovirus. at  <dig> hours post infection the cells were induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of egf and then harvested  <dig> hours later. the amount of dn-akt was assayed by western blotting and the influence of dn-akt on the β-casein promotor luciferase activity was determined . in the absence of egf, infection with the dn-akt adenovirus did not affect the dip-induced promotor activity, but dn-akt partially rescued the egf-induced inhibition of β-casein promotor luciferase activity compared to lacz vector control. in addition, the rescue of luciferase activity was greater in the dn-akt infected cells than in ly <dig> treated cells when cells were stimulated with dip in the presence of egf.

the effect of dn-akt on β-casein rna expression in hc <dig> cells treated with lactogenic hormone was assessed . infection with the dn-akt adenovirus doubled β-casein rna expression in the hc <dig> cell line compared to vector control infected cells. because the expression of conditionally active-akt <dig> blocked lactogenic differentiation and dominant negative-akt <dig> enhanced lactogenic differentiation, we conclude that akt activity can contribute to the regulation of lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> cells.

egf activates p <dig> kinase, jnk and p70s <dig> kinase via pi-3-k and mtor dependent mechanisms in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells
both akt <dig> and p38mapk have been identified as a potential downstream targets of egf signaling in mammary epithelial cells. in addition, akt stimulates activation of mtor. the effect of blocking pi-3-kinase pathway, including mtor and the stress kinase pathways, on egf-induced inhibition of lactogenic differentiation was determined in hc11-luci cells. inhibitors of mek, pi-3-kinase and p <dig> kinase as well as rapamycin, an mtor inhibitor, were added to hc11-luci cells in dip-induction media in the presence of egf. luciferase activity was measured  <dig> hours post-induction and normalized to protein concentration . as expected the addition of egf to the dip induction media resulted in inhibition of luciferase activity, and each inhibitor alone significantly restored the β-casein promotor activity compared to dip plus egf. in combination analyses it appeared that pd <dig>  the mek-erk inhibitor, produced synergistic effects with ly <dig> and rapamycin. however, combinations of ly <dig> with rapamycin and sb <dig> produced additive or less than additive responses. this was also the case for a combination of rapamycin with sb <dig>  these results demonstrate that the egf-induced disruption of lactogenic differentiation proceeds by blocking both the ras-raf-mek-erk pathway and the pi-3-kinase pathway. in addition, the results suggest that egf-induced activation of mtor and p <dig> are both dependent on pi-3-kinase signaling in hc <dig> cells . it should be noted that the increase in luciferase activity detected in inhibitor-treated cells is specific to recovery of activity blocked by egf. the treatment of hc11-luci cells with high levels of pi-3-kinase or mtor inhibitors in the absence of egf reduced cell viability and thereby decreased lactogenic differentiation .

hc <dig> cells were examined to more fully characterize the effect of pi-3-kinase and mtor inhibitors on several signal transduction pathways induced by egf. hc <dig> cells were serum starved in the absence of egf and incubated for  <dig> hours with ly <dig> or rapamycin prior to stimulation with egf. the cell lysates were harvested following egf stimulation and analyzed by western blotting for expression and phosphorylation of akt, gsk3β, p70s <dig> kinase and the map kinases erk, jnk and p <dig>  the pi-3-kinase inhibitor completely blocked the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of akt on serine  <dig> and p70s <dig> kinase on threonine  <dig> and partially blocked the phosphorylation and activation of p <dig> and jnk . the mtor inhibitor rapapmycin completely blocked the activation of p <dig>  jnk and p70s <dig> kinase . however, neither inhibitor blocked the activation of erk <dig>  the data demonstrate that egf-induced activation of p <dig>  jnk and p70s <dig> kinase in hc <dig> cells is both pi-3-kinase and mtor dependent. because the addition of ly <dig> to either rapamycin or sb <dig> did not increase their ability to block effects of egf, it suggests that blocking pi-3-kinase inhibits p <dig> and mtor in hc <dig> cells. because the combination of the pi-3-kinase and mek/erk inhibitors synergistically increased β-casein promotor luciferase activity  and because neither ly <dig> nor rapamycin affects egf-induced erk activation , we conclude that the pi-3-kinase and mek/erk signaling pathways are independent and synergistic in their ability to block lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> cells.

egf stimulation results in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s <dig>  elongation initiation factor 4e, eif4e-binding protein  <dig> via pi-3-kinase/mtor dependent mechanisms
the akt/mtor/p70s <dig> kinase pathway regulates cell growth and proliferation via the regulation of protein synthesis  <cit> . to elucidate the potential role of pi-3-kinase in hc <dig> cell protein synthesis we investigated the activation state of potential substrates of p70s <dig> kinase following egf stimulation. hc <dig> cells were serum starved in the absence of egf and incubated with ly <dig>  rapamycin or pd <dig> prior to stimulation with egf. the cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by western blotting using antibodies specific for phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the indicated proteins. the pi-3-kinase and mtor inhibitors blocked the phosphorylation of elongation initiation factor 4e  on serine  <dig>  eif4e-binding protein  <dig>  on serine  <dig>  as well as ribosomal protein s <dig>  at ser235/ <dig> . the mek/erk inhibitor blocked the phosphorylation of mnk <dig> at thr197/ <dig> , an event that is known to be mek/erk dependent  <cit> . however, phosphorylation of eif4e was not affected by pd <dig> treatment and the subsequent inhibition of mnk <dig>  but it was prevented by rapamycin which blocks p70s <dig> kinase activation . this indicates that eif4e phosphorylation was due to p70s <dig> kinase and not mnk <dig> 

the ability of a conditionally active-akt to activate p70s <dig> kinase was tested . hc <dig> cells were transfected with ca-akt or a vector control plasmid. the expression of conditionally active-akt in presence of tamoxifen resulted in constitutive activation of p70s <dig> kinase. therefore, both egf stimulation and constitutive akt can activate p70s <dig> kinase. hence, the evidence suggests that one mechanism by which egf-induced pi-3-kinase activation prevents lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells may involve the akt-dependent activation of p70s <dig> kinase, and the subsequent phosphorylation of rps <dig>  eif4e, and 4e-bp <dig> 

the role of insulin signal to the pi-3-kinase and mtor in hc <dig> cells
because the growth media, the differentiation media and the starvation media used in the above experiments contained insulin, the results addressed the role of the pi-3-kinase pathway in transmitting egf-induced signals to akt, mtor and p70s <dig> kinase without considering the potential of insulin to activate the same pathways. to address this question hc <dig> cells were starved of insulin as well as serum and growth factor, then stimulated with either insulin or egf in the presence of low levels of pi-3-kinase or mtor inhibitors. the results in figure  <dig> detect differences in the p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylation and kinase activity toward rps <dig> that was dictated by the stimulatory agent. insulin stimulation of akt  was pi-3-kinase-dependent, and phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase  was pi-3-kinase and mtor-dependent. insulin stimulation resulted in pi-3-kinase-and mtor-dependent rps <dig> phosphorylation. in contrast, the stimulation of rps <dig> phosphorylation by egf was partially independent of pi-3-kinase-and mtor pathways. this additional rps <dig> phosphorylation correlated with elevated p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylation at thr  <dig> and ser  <dig>  the autoinhibitory site reported to contribute to its activity in vivo  <cit> . because higher levels of pi-3-kinase and mtor inhibitors completely eliminated this signal , it appears that egf requires akt and mtor to activate p70s <dig> kinase and that residual low level activity of p70s <dig> kinase can be enhanced by egf-dependent phosphorylation at thr  <dig> and ser  <dig>  hence, we conclude that both insulin and egf stimulate the pi-3-kinase-akt-mtor-p70s <dig> kinase pathway, but that egf modulates p70s <dig> kinase activity in a manner not activated by insulin.

in addition, differences in the phosphorylation of 4e-bp <dig> and elf4e were detected in response to insulin and egf . there is mtor-independent 4e-bp <dig> and elf4e phosphorylation in response to insulin that is not detected with egf, suggesting that insulin stimulation of these pathways may be different from that seen with egf i.e. that insulin signaling may phosphorylate these substrates via a pathway other than mtor.

dexamethasone contributes to the inhibition of p70s <dig> kinase during lactogenic differentiation of hc <dig> cells
the studies described above addressed short-term stimulation of cells with egf. next, the long-term activation of signal transduction pathways dependent on pi-3-kinase stimulation was examined in hc <dig> cells . hc <dig> cells were treated with lactogenic hormone mix in the presence or absence of egf and ly <dig> for times up to  <dig> hours. cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting for phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase. in the hc <dig> cells stimulated with the lactogenic hormone mix dip the activation of p70s <dig> kinase on threonine  <dig> completely diminished by approximately  <dig> hours, whereas in the cells stimulated with dip in the presence of egf the activation of p70s <dig> kinase persisted for  <dig> hours. in contrast, the cells exposed to dip and egf with ly <dig> showed no p70s <dig> kinase activation at any time point after induction. these results suggest that blocking the pi-3-kinase pathway at the time of dip-induction enhanced differentiation via a similar mechanism to that described above in short term assays, i.e. inactivation of akt/mtor/p70s <dig> kinase.

dexamethasone is a component of the lactogenic hormone mix, dip. because dexamethasone can inhibit p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylation and protein synthesis  <cit> , we investigated the ability of dexamethasone alone to inhibit the phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase . hc <dig> cells were exposed to dexamethasone in the presence or absence of egf and ly <dig> for times up to  <dig> hours. the lysates were analyzed by western blotting for phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase. in the hc <dig> cells treated with dexamethasone the phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase decreased during the first  <dig> hours, while cells exposed to a combination of dexamethasone and egf showed p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylation through  <dig> hours. the cells treated with dexamethasone and egf plus ly <dig> exhibited no p70s <dig> kinase activation at any time point after induction. these results suggest that dexamethasone inhibits p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylaton and that the presence of egf overcomes the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on this pathway.

discussion
mammary gland development can be divided into seven stages: embryonic, postnatal, juvenile, puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and involution. one of the leading risk factors for breast cancer is nullparity  <cit> . hence, the delineation of factors that regulate lactogenesis  is important in understanding the etiology of breast cancer.

excess activation of signaling pathways downstream of the epidermal growth factor receptor, erbb <dig>  has been directly linked to breast cancer development and chemotherapeutic resistance  <cit> . while egf is required for normal mammary epithelial cell proliferation, it has been shown to inhibit lactogenic differentiation of hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo, concomitant with stimulation of the ras/mek/erk and the pi-3-kinase pathways  <cit> . the pi-3-kinase pathway is important in tumorigenesis in several ways. aberrant pi-3-kinase activation has been demonstrated to promote both proliferation and survival of transformed cells, including those exhibiting egf-dependent transformation. the mutation and deregulation of pi-3-kinase pathway components has recently been linked to a number of human malignancies  <cit>  and breast cancer associated mutations of the p <dig> catalytic subunit of pi-3-kinase were oncogenic when tested in immortalized mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . elevated akt levels have been found in breast, ovarian, colon and thyroid cancers  <cit> .

the data reported here confirm and extend our earlier results indicating that pi-3-kinase inhibitors rescue the egf-induced block of β-casein promotor-regulated luciferase activity, β-casein transcription and mammosphere formation in lactogen-treated hc <dig> cells. furthermore, the expression of a conditionally active-akt <dig> blocked lactogenic differentiation, whereas dominant negative-akt <dig> enhanced it. these results indicate that egf blocks hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation in part via a pi-3-kinase/akt dependent mechanism. in addition, our data indicate that in hc <dig> cells pi-3-kinase regulated the egf-dependent transcription of cyclin d <dig> and osteopontin  , both of which are regulated by the pi-3-kinase pathway in tumor cells  <cit> . however, pi-3-kinase inhibition did not entirely prevent the egf-induced reduction in transcription of differentiation specific target genes. for example, egf blocks transcription of prolactin-induced protein, pip, via the mek/erk and not pi-3-kinase pathways . consequently, we conclude that the involvement of the pi-3-kinase pathway in blocking lactogenic differentiation is partly independent of stat5-induced transcriptional changes.

the inhibitory effect of pi-3-kinase on β-casein transcription and β-casein promotor luciferase activity is likely through combined mechanisms involving signals mediated by prolactin and dexamethasone. dexamethasone can play a role in inhibiting the phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase thereby decreasing protein synthesis  <cit> . our study reveals that dexamethasone inhibits the phosphorylation of p70s <dig> kinase in hc <dig> cells. this suggests a role for dexamethasone in lactogenic hormone-induced differentiation in addition to its role in activating glucocorticoid receptor, which acts synergistically with stat <dig> to initiate β-casein transcription  <cit> . pi-3-kinase mediated translational control influences differentiation in erythroid precursers. stem cell factor delays differentiation of erythroid precursers in part by activating pi-3-kinase pathway resulting in 4e-bp <dig> phosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment of growth-specific mrnas into polysomes  <cit> ; and ectopic expression of eif4e in these cells has the same effect  <cit> . our work has not identified specific protein targets whose synthesis is translationally regulated by the pi-3-kinase/akt/mtor pathway in hc <dig> cells. however, a recent study demonstrated that erbb <dig> increases the synthesis of the vascular endothelial growth factor  protein via the activation of mtor and p70s6k in human breast cancer cells  <cit> . this finding suggests that it may be essential to down regulate vegf or other growth factors in order for lactogenic differentiation to proceed. also, socs- <dig> can be translationally repressed via a cap-dependent mechanism  <cit> , suggesting that another effect of activation of pi-3-kinase pathway may be the elevation of socs- <dig> and inhibition of prolactin-induced jak-stat signaling.

through the use of chemical inhibitors, alone or in combination, our data revealed that the pi-3-kinase and mek/erk signaling pathways are independent and synergistic in their block of hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation. we determined that egf activates phosphorylation of akt, mtor, p70s <dig> kinase, ribosomal protein s <dig>  eif4e and 4e-bp <dig> in a pi-3-kinase dependent manner, and pi-3-kinase activation may prevent lactogenic differentiation in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells by regulating the synthesis of proteins.

while several studies have suggested that erk activation can be regulated through the pi-3-kinase pathway  <cit>  our data demonstrated that egf stimulation of erk activation in hc <dig> mammary epithelial cells was not altered by blocking pi-3-kinase signaling with ly <dig>  in addition, our previous work revealed that pi-3-kinase activation by egf receptor proceeded without requiring ras activation  <cit> . a report by bailey et al. demonstrated that low level activation of akt by prolactin stimulation blocked the inhibitory effects of exogenous tgfβ on hc <dig> cells  <cit> . our study examined the effects of stronger akt activation by mitogen rather than by tgfβ, which induces apoptosis in hc <dig> cells. while no previous studies have addressed the mechanism by which pi-3-kinase blocks lactogenic differentiation, we demonstrated that the inhibition of pi-3-k, akt or mtor blocked the activation of p70s <dig> kinase and its downstream targets. we also demonstrated that the expression of a conditionally active-akt <dig> leads to the constitutive activation of p70s <dig> kinase. interestingly, we discovered that pdk <dig> is constitutively phosphorylated in hc <dig> cells and this is not blocked by ly <dig>  while pdk <dig> has been shown to directly activate p70s <dig> kinase independently of akt  <cit> , our results indicate that the activation of p70s <dig> kinase is dependent on akt and mtor in hc <dig> cells.

the present study enhances our knowledge of hc <dig> mammary epithelial differentiation in several ways. we demonstrated that akt activation can inhibit lactogenic hormone induced differentiation in mammary epithelial cells. two previous studies questioned whether pi-3-kinase activation of akt in normal mammary epithelial cells is sufficient for cellular transformation  <cit> . our observation that blocking the activation of pi-3-kinase restored mammosphere formation, which was inhibited by egf, is in agreement with reports that conditionally active-akt <dig> promotes large and misshapen acinar structures in mcf-10a cells  <cit> . however, the results obtained from cell culture experiments are somewhat different from in vivo analysis of akt. akt is expressed during lactation in vivo at a point when levels of other kinases are diminishing  <cit> . the expression presumably plays a critical function in cell survival at this point in mammary differentiation. the transgenic expression of mmtv-ca-akt enhanced/temporally extended the expression of β-casein and resulted in more differentiated cells surviving in the tissue during lactation again at the time when other receptor tyrosine kinases were nearly absent  <cit> . recently jankiewitz et al. demonstrated that treatment of lactating mice with rapamycin decreased the size of the mammary glands and inhibited hc <dig> differentiation by blocking lactogenic hormone-induced expression of the transcriptional regulator id <dig>  <cit> . our hc <dig> experiments were performed in immortalized hc <dig> cells grown in the presence of insulin and fetal bovine serum, sources of stimulation for other receptor tyrosine kinases including those required for cell survival. we also found that blocking pi-3-kinase signaling with chemical inhibitors in the absence of additional mitogen decreased hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation. however, the stimulation of downstream pathways by egf or ca-akt was in excess of the normal cell survival signaling and thereby altered cell responses accordingly. our results indicate that activation of p70s <dig> kinase under those conditions is detrimental to hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation. while this study presents a comprehensive investigation of the role that egf-induced pi-3-kinase and akt play in hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation, further studies in animal models will provide a greater understanding of the role of pi-3-kinase and p70s <dig> kinase on erbb <dig> signals during hormonal regulation of the mammary gland.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that egf-induced activation of pi-3-kinase results in akt- and mtor-dependent-p70s <dig> kinase phosphorylation in hc <dig> cells. the egf-induced activation of pi-3-kinase-akt-mtor regulates phosphorylation of molecules including rps <dig>  eif4e and 4e-bp <dig> that influence translational control. the activation of this pathway contributes to the inhibition of hc <dig> lactogenic differentiation by egf.
