BACKGROUND
the adult vertebrate body is composed of various segmented structures, such as the vertebrae, ribs, intervertebral disks, peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles. one of the earliest manifestations of segmental patterning during vertebrate embryogenesis is the generation of transient, serially repeated structures known as somites. somites are epithelial blocks of paraxial mesoderm cells that are laid symmetrically on either side of the neural tube from the rostral extremity of the presomitic mesoderm  in an anterior-posterior  manner. ongoing gastrulation at the posterior part of the psm ensures embryo growth as new somite pairs arise from the anterior psm. these structures are periodically formed and the time required to form a somite pair, as well as the total number of somite pairs generated, is extraordinarily constant and species-specific. in the chick embryo a new pair of somites is formed every  <dig> min, to a total of  <dig> somite pairs  <cit> .

in  <dig>  palmeirim and collaborators disclosed a molecular clock underlying vertebrate embryo somitogenesis when analysing the expression pattern of the hairy <dig> gene in chick embryos  <cit> . this gene is cyclically expressed in psm cells every  <dig> min, which corresponds to the time required for a new somite pair to be generated  <cit> . the number of hairy <dig> oscillations at any given moment is proposed to provide cells with temporal and positional information along both anterior-posterior and medial-lateral psm axes  <cit> . further work performed in our lab showed that a molecular clock is also operating during limb bud development  <cit> , suggesting that the segmentation clock is not an exclusive property of psm tissue, but may be a more general way to count time during vertebrate development, providing positional information to different types of cells.

besides participating in the somitogenesis clock in psm cells, hairy <dig> is continuously expressed in the caudal region of formed somites. newly formed somites present two distinct compartments, which are the basis for the resegmentation process that later leads to vertebrae formation  <cit> . somite ap polarity is generated in the anterior psm by mesp <dig> and delta/notch signalling  <cit>  and the maintenance of rostral and caudal identities in newly formed somites is tightly dependent on tbx <dig> and uncx <dig>  gene expression, respectively  <cit> . the regionalized, persistent hairy <dig> expression in the posterior somite region suggests that hairy <dig> could participate in somite polarity establishment and/or maintenance, although this has not yet been addressed experimentally.

hairy <dig> belongs to the hairy-enhancer-of-split /hes) family of transcriptional repressor proteins  <cit> . all hes members share conserved functional motifs: the basic domain  required for dna-binding, a helix-loop-helix dimerization domain , an orange domain  which confers specificity among family members and the c-terminal wrpw tetrapeptide required for co-factor binding  <cit> . the evidence to date suggests that hes proteins can be involved in an array of repression mechanisms via the recruitment of different protein partners, forming complexes with different specificities  <cit> . hes-mediated transcriptional repression has been shown to be an important feature of many embryonic developmental processes  <cit> . data obtained from mouse and zebrafish embryos have shown that hairy-related proteins act as transcriptional repressors in somitogenesis: hes <dig> participates in auto-regulatory negative feedback loops  <cit> , probably mediated by direct protein interaction with the notch signalling component rbp-jκ <cit> ; hes <dig> represses transcription from n box- and e box-containing promoters  <cit> ; hes <dig> represses its own transcription and also lfng expression  <cit> ; her <dig>  interacts with her <dig> and represses both her <dig> and her <dig>  <cit> .

although the expression of chick hairy <dig> and its homologues has been demonstrated during somitogenesis in many animal models, it is not clear what the outputs of hairy <dig> expression are, both in the molecular clock and during somite formation and differentiation. chick hairy <dig> is only known to form homo-dimers and hetero-dimers with two other hes family members, hey  <dig> and hey <dig>  through their bhlh-or protein domains  <cit> . furthermore, the mechanisms of hairy1-mediated transcriptional repression have not yet been addressed in the chick embryo. aiming at understanding the molecular events triggered by chick hairy <dig>  we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system to identify hairy <dig> protein interaction partners. the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit>  is a well established technique used to study protein-protein interactions, which are critical in virtually all cellular processes. sap <dig> , a component of the sin3/histone deacetylase  transcriptional repressor complex  <cit> , was found to interact with the c-terminal portion of the hairy <dig> protein. hairy1/sap <dig> interaction was independently confirmed by in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays. whole mount in situ hybridization experiments showed that sap <dig>  sin3a and hairy <dig> mrna co-localize in the rostral-most part of the chick embryo psm and in the caudal compartment of already formed somites. our results indicate that in these tissues chick hairy <dig> may mediate gene transcriptional repression by recruiting the sin3/hdac complex through a direct interaction with the sap <dig> adaptor molecule. moreover, since sap <dig> and sin3a are not expressed in the psm territory where hairy <dig> presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for hairy <dig> throughout the psm and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.

RESULTS
interaction of hairy <dig> with sap <dig> revealed by yeast two-hybrid analysis
the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen proteins that associate with the c-terminal portion of the chick hairy <dig> protein . mrna was extracted from stage hh <dig> – hh <dig> chick embryos and a cdna library was constructed in the pgadt <dig> plasmid. the c-term fragment of the hairy <dig> protein was cloned in the pgbkt <dig> vector and the resulting bait construct was used to screen the constructed chick embryo cdna library. two different plasmids were isolated from positive-interaction yeast colonies which coded for the entire chick sap <dig> protein  or a truncated form, lacking the first  <dig> amino acids .

hairy <dig> protein interaction with sap <dig> was confirmed by performing additional yeast two-hybrid experiments using the whole hairy <dig> protein, or its n-terminus  as bait. the documented interaction between hairy <dig> proteins in a homodimer  <cit>  was used as a positive control . bait and prey constructs were transformed into the opposite mating-type yeast strains y <dig> and ah <dig>  respectively, and the transformed strains were mated and spread on appropriate selective media. positive interactions were observed for hairy1/hairy <dig>  c-term/sap <dig> and hairy1/sap <dig>  while no interaction was detected between bhlh-or/sap <dig> or in the negative control reactions, as expected .

the relative strength of hairy1/sap <dig> protein interaction was determined by scoring for reporter β-galactosidase activity , using the hairy1/hairy <dig> protein interaction as a reference  <cit> . we found that hairy <dig> has a similar affinity for sap <dig> as it has for hairy <dig> itself, and that the association between hairy <dig> c-terminal portion and sap <dig> is almost twice as strong as that for the whole protein . this is most probably due to the absence of the dna-binding bhlh domain, leading to a relief of reporter gene repression. altogether, our yeast two-hybrid results indicate that hairy <dig> associates with sap <dig> and that hairy1's c-terminal domain mediates this interaction.

co-immunoprecipitation of hairy <dig> with sap18
to independently validate the interaction between chick hairy <dig> and sap <dig> proteins, in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. chick hairy <dig> and sap <dig> genes cloned in pgbkt <dig> and pgadt <dig> vectors, respectively, were used to generate 35s-labeled c-myc-hairy <dig> and ha-sap <dig> through in vitro transcription/translation reactions. upon incubation of both proteins, hairy <dig> immunoprecipitated with sap <dig> when either c-myc or ha antibodies were employed . this was not the case when in vitro transcription/translation reaction products of the empty vectors were used. this experiment confirms the hairy1/sap <dig> protein association identified in the yeast two-hybrid assay.

characterization of chick sap <dig> mrna expression pattern
having established that chick proteins hairy <dig> and sap <dig> can interact, we set out to determine if this protein interaction could be of biological relevance in our system, namely, during the process of somitogenesis. if that were so, sap <dig> gene expression should co-localize with hairy <dig> mrna distribution in the chick embryo.

a sap <dig> antisense mrna probe was generated and whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments were performed with the purpose of characterizing sap <dig> expression pattern in the chick embryo. at early stages, sap <dig> is expressed at the level of the primitive streak in prospective neural cells , is absent from the neural tube facing the psm  and is upregulated throughout all the neural tube positioned rostrally to the psm territory . in older embryos, sap <dig> is expressed along the entire neural tube ap axis . in all embryos, sap <dig> expression is absent from most of the psm tissue, being upregulated only in the rostral part of the psm, the region that will give rise to the prospective somites, and in already formed somites. chick hairy <dig> is also present in the prospective somites and in the caudal region of formed somites  <cit> , indicating that the hairy1/sap <dig> protein interaction might play a functional role in these tissues.

co-localization of hairy <dig>  sap <dig> and sin3a mrna expression patterns
sap <dig> has been shown to interact directly with sin3a and act as an adaptor molecule bridging the sin3/hdac complex to sequence-specific dna-binding proteins  <cit> . since sap <dig> associates with hairy <dig>  it could be recruiting the sin3a complex for hairy1-mediated transcriptional repression during chick embryo development. for this to be true, both sap <dig> and sin3a mrnas should co-localize with each other and with hairy <dig> gene expression domains.

a sin3a antisense mrna probe was generated and whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments revealed that many sin3a expression domains  coincide with those of sap <dig> in the chick embryo, namely in the prospective somite region and in somites . this is in accordance to their reported protein interaction and biological role in transcriptional regulation. moreover, both sap <dig> and sin3a expression patterns co-localize with hairy <dig> mrna in the caudal region of somites and in the rostral part of the psm . these results suggest that in these tissues hairy1/sap <dig> interaction could be mediating the recruitment of the sin3/hdac repressor complex to hairy1-target gene promoters.

although hairy <dig> expression can be observed throughout the whole chick psm, both sap <dig> and sin3a mrnas are absent, except in the rostral-most region. this implies that hairy <dig> is not capable of exerting gene transcriptional repression through sap18-mediated sin3/hdac complex recruitment in the psm regions where it is cyclically expressed.

discussion
members of the hairy-enhancer-of-split /hes) family of proteins are reported to be transcriptional repressors. hes proteins can form homo- or hetero-dimers and repress gene expression either through direct binding to cis regulatory elements in the promoter or by sequestering, and thereby inactivating, transcriptional activators of the target gene. when bound to promoter dna, hes proteins can recruit transcriptional regulatory protein complexes through their c-terminal domain and therefore exert repressor activity .

this study reports a protein interaction screen performed with the c-terminal portion of the chick hairy-enhancer-of-split protein hairy <dig>  using yeast two-hybrid technology. we have established that sap <dig>  the 18-kda sin3-associated protein, is a hairy1-interacting protein, using both yeast two-hybrid experiments and in vitro co-immunoprecipitation assays. chick embryo sap <dig> and sin3a expression patterns were characterized for the first time and were found to co-localize with each other and with hairy <dig> mrna in the prospective somitic territory and in the caudal region of already formed somites. our results provide novel insights into hairy1-mediated transcriptional repression during chick embryo development, suggesting that hairy <dig> may repress target gene transcription through a direct interaction with sap <dig> protein, recruiting the sin3/hdac transcriptional repressor protein complex .

the sin3/hdac complex is highly conserved from yeast to human and contains hdac activity, causing transcriptional repression mainly by deacetylating histones . sap <dig> is an integral member of the sin3/hdac transcriptional repressor complex and it functions as an adaptor polypeptide, tethering the protein complex to promoters by interacting with sequence-specific dna binding proteins, since members of the sin3/hdac complex lack intrinsic dna binding activity  <cit> . to date, the mechanisms of hairy1-mediated transcriptional repression have not been addressed in the chick embryo. our work suggests that upon binding to specific dna promoter elements, chick hairy <dig> is capable of interacting with sap <dig>  which in turn recruits the sin3/hdac repressor complex, repressing hairy1-target gene transcription . in fact, the recruitment of the sin3/hdac complex through interaction with sap <dig> has already been shown for the drosophila gaga factor  <cit>  and bicoid genes  <cit> , as well as for mouse suppressor of fused protein, msu  <cit>  and dna polymerase, dpe <dig>  <cit> .

the gene encoding hairy <dig> presents cyclic expression in the chick embryo psm, while in somites hairy <dig> expression ceases to cycle and is persistent in the posterior somitic region  <cit> . in their recent review on the hes gene family, kageyama and collaborators  <cit>  point out that low levels of hes <dig> down-regulate cell cycle inhibitors, promoting cellular proliferation. on the other hand, continuous and high levels of hes <dig> expression inhibit the cell cycle. this highlights another, as yet, unaddressed issue in somitogenesis: is hairy <dig> involved in the same biological functions in the psm, where it is cyclically expressed in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, and in the caudal somitic region, where its expression is persistent?

our study strongly points to different roles for hairy <dig> in the psm cyclic expression domain and in the rostral-most psm and caudal region of somites. the expression of both sap <dig> and sin3a genes is absent from psm cells and is up-regulated only in prospective and already-formed somites. this clearly indicates that hairy <dig> is only capable of interacting with sap <dig>  recruiting the sin3/hdac complex for transcriptional repression in these tissues and not along the entire psm, suggesting that this mechanism is not involved in the somitogenesis clock machinery. instead, we can hypothesize that hairy <dig> transcriptional repression through sap18-mediated sin3/hdac complex recruitment may be required for somite formation and/or polarization.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified an interaction between the c-terminal domain of the chick protein hairy <dig> and the sin3/hdac repressor complex adaptor molecule, sap <dig>  the expression patterns of chick sap <dig> and sin3a genes were characterized for the first time and were shown to co-localize with hairy <dig> mrna in the rostral psm and caudal region of formed somites. our results indicate that hairy <dig> may be mediating transcriptional repression in these tissues by interacting with sap <dig> and recruiting the sin3/hdac transcriptional repressor complex to the promoters of its target genes . moreover, since sap <dig> and sin3a are not expressed in the psm territory where hairy <dig> presents cyclic expression, our study strongly points to different roles for hairy <dig> throughout the psm and in the prospective somite and caudal region of already formed somites.
