BACKGROUND
the sequencing and assembly of a horse genome was a great achievement in equine genomics and veterinary medicine because of the broad range of potential applications of this information for improving health and performance and for understanding differences among species  <cit> . to date, however, only a single genome of a thoroughbred mare has been sequenced and made publicly available  <cit> . the current catalog of genetic variants in the equine genome consists of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms , with no insertion/deletion polymorphisms  or copy number variants  having been deposited into a publicly available database . of the known snps in horses, most  originate from the thoroughbred mare used for the genome assembly  <cit> .

sequencing the genome of a quarter horse was considered important for several reasons. almost  <dig> million quarter horses were registered in the united states in  <dig> according to the american quarter horse association, making it the single largest breed registry in the country  <cit> . when one includes non-registered quarter horses and other quarter horse-influenced breed registries , the quarter horse is by far the largest contributor to the population of horses in the united states. although quarter horse breeding was, and continues to be, strongly influenced by thoroughbred bloodlines, the  <dig> breeds were selectively bred to enhance different traits. thoroughbred breeding has selected for speed over distances of 3/ <dig> to  <dig> miles, whereas selection in the quarter horse has emphasized speed over shorter distances and compliant disposition suited to working cattle and other ranch-related duties  <cit> . thus, there are important phenotypic differences between the breeds that have been achieved by selective breeding with a clear underlying genetic component  <cit> . moreover, there are single-gene disorders in quarter horses, such as polysaccharide storage myopathy   <cit> , hyperkalemic periodic paralysis   <cit> , glycogen branching enzyme deficiency   <cit> , and hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia   <cit> . most diseases and traits  are complex, involving multiple genes, which may be modulated by environmental factors  <cit> . thus, identifying genetic variants in the genome of a single quarter horse would provide a wealth of information for future genomic studies in equids.

here we describe the whole-genome sequencing of an individual quarter horse mare using massively parallel paired-end sequencing. sequence reads were mapped to the reference thoroughbred nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. we developed a comprehensive list of genetic variants, including snps, indels, and cnvs. we annotated genetic variants and examined their impact on gene structure and function. the genomic sequence was also examined for mutations and polymorphisms associated with diseases and traits in horses. furthermore, we examined biological processes enriched for genetic variants and compared these biological processes between this quarter horse mare and the reference thoroughbred mare.

RESULTS
whole-genome sequencing, alignment, and identification of new genomic sequence
genomic dna was obtained from a single blood sample of a quarter horse mare owned by texas a&m university. the mare's pedigree was heavily influenced by stock and racing quarter horses, with no introgression of thoroughbred lines during the preceding  <dig> generations. a small insert library with an average size of approximately  <dig> base-pair  was generated , and  <dig> lanes of 75-bp paired-end sequencing were performed using the illumina genome analyzer ii  . a schematic of the sequence mapping and variant identification, annotation, and analysis is presented in figure  <dig>  the sequencing reactions yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads totaling  <dig> , <dig>  bases of dna . sequence reads were trimmed and mapped to the assembled autosomes, × chromosome, and mitochondrial genome of the reference thoroughbred horse genome . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  were aligned to approximately 97% of the reference genome , resulting in an average of  <dig> x sequence coverage of the horse's genome . sequence coverage of assembled chromosomes ranged from 13x to 55x . additionally,  <dig>  reads mapped to 100% of the reference mitochondrial genome, resulting in an average of  <dig> x sequence coverage. reads not mapping to assembled chromosomes were subsequently mapped to the unassembled chromosomes , where  <dig> , <dig> reads  were mapped. next, we de novo assembled  <dig> , <dig> reads  not mapping to the assembled or unassembled chromosomes. the de novo assembly yielded  <dig>  contigs totaling  <dig>  million bases  of sequence . blat and blast analysis of the contigs to other genomes did not result in any significant alignment.

identification of genetic variants
we analyzed sequences mapped to the assembled chromosomes for putative snps, indels, and cnvs. snps were required to meet several stringent criteria  and were further filtered to remove those near other variants  or within the pseudo-autosomal region  of the × chromosome. the resulting snps were then filtered using different minimum read-depths . as expected, increasing the minimum read-depth resulted in fewer snps being detected . additionally, we found that a greater proportion of the total snps was lost than that of the total non-synonymous snps, with homozygous snps being lost at the highest rate . at 10x coverage, which was the minimum read-depth used for the subsequent annotation and downstream analysis, we identified  <dig> , <dig> snps. additionally, we characterized and annotated snps detected at lower minimum read-depths . intergenic snps, located within  <dig>  bases  upstream or downstream of a gene, were determined as well as genic snps located within introns, non-coding exons, 5' and 3' untranslated regions , intron and exon splice sites, and coding exons. non-synonymous snps were further annotated as either radical or conservative . additionally, we identified snps located within the coding exons of  <dig> candidate imprinted genes for future studies in the horse . analysis of the mitochondrial genome identified  <dig> snps, including  <dig> heteroplasmic snps .

comparison of putative snps in the mapped sequences to the horse snp database  revealed that  <dig>  were known and  <dig> , <dig> were novel, including  <dig>  non-synonymous snps  and  <dig>  complex  snps. comparison of the putative snps to those identified in the sequencing and assembly of the reference thoroughbred genome revealed that  <dig>  snps were overlapping between the  <dig> horses, including  <dig>  intergenic and  <dig>  genic snps. by removing overlapping known snps, we found that the quarter horse and thoroughbred genomes had  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  unique snps, respectively.

using a minimum read-depth of 10x and similar filtering methods described for the snp analysis, we identified  <dig>  indels . additionally, we identified and annotated indels using lower read-depth coverage . although our analysis was limited to indels no greater than  <dig> bp, the overwhelming majority were single bp gains and losses . of the indels identified,  <dig>  caused a frameshift mutation  in a coding exon, whereas  <dig> did not . in addition,  <dig> indels lead to the creation of a stop codon . given the high number of indels affecting coding exons, particularly the large number of homozygous indels, we annotated them using the refseq annotation. the analysis revealed that  <dig> refseq genes contained indels, including  <dig> genes with loss of a stop codon and  <dig> with a frameshift.

copy number variants  were identified using a read-depth algorithm that corrects for gc bias. cnvs were then filtered to remove those within telomeric regions, as investigation of these regions is associated with high false discovery rates  <cit> . the filtered analysis revealed  <dig> cnvs, including  <dig> gains,  <dig> losses, and  <dig> homozygous deletions . the sizes ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  mb, with an average length of  <dig>  kb. annotation of the cnvs indicated that  <dig> and  <dig> were genic and intergenic, respectively.

pathway, trait, and disease analysis of identified genetic variants
we performed a functional annotation clustering analysis of genes containing snps, indels, and cnvs to identify biological processes  enriched for these classes of genetic variants. using the horse ensembl gene identification  for the functional annotation clustering, we found that only a small percentage of bp terms were returned . therefore, we decided to perform the analysis using the human orthologs of horse genes found to possess genetic variants. of the  <dig>  genes containing non-synonymous snps,  <dig>  had human orthologs and  <dig>  returned bp terms . clustering analysis indicated that non-synonymous snps were enriched  in pathways for sensory perception , cellular processes , and signal transduction . separate functional enrichment analysis of genes with either radical or conservative non-synonymous snps revealed that the biological processes of the enriched pathways remained unchanged, although there was an increase in enrichment of conservative amino acid changes in the immunity and defense pathway . clustering analysis of indels indicated that genes containing variants were enriched in pathways for signal transduction , developmental processes , and cellular processes . analysis of cnvs indicated that genes containing variants were enriched in pathways for sensory perception , immunity and defense , and signal transduction .

comparison of biological pathways containing heterozygous non-synonymous snps between the quarter horse and reference thoroughbred  revealed that the quarter horse had snps enriched in pathways for sensory perception , cellular processes , and signal transduction , whereas the thoroughbred had snps enriched in pathways for immunity and defense , sensory perception , and cellular processes . as the enrichment analysis reflected percentages of genes within pathways, and because the quarter horse contained nearly three times as many heterozygous snps as the thoroughbred, we determined the total number of genes for each bp term that contained a non-synonymous heterozygous snp. as expected, the quarter horse had more genes containing snps for each bp class, except for the immune and defense  and nucleic acid metabolism  pathways .

next, we investigated the dna sequence of the quarter horse mare for mutations of known diseases and for snps associated with various traits in horses . we found the quarter horse to be heterozygous for a c.115g > a mutation in the cyclophilin b  gene, which causes hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia  <cit> , heterozygous for the g.901c > t snp associated with chestnut coat color  <cit> , and homozygous for the g.66493737c > t and g.22684390c > t snps associated with racing endurance in thoroughbred horses  <cit> . no other mutations or polymorphisms underlying known diseases or traits were identified.

discussion
the current catalog of equine genetic variants is limited and primarily consists of those detected from the sequencing and assembly of a single thoroughbred horse  <cit> . in the present study, we describe the whole-genome sequencing and identification of genetic variants in the genome of a quarter horse mare. to our knowledge, this is the first published report of a whole-genome sequence of a quarter horse and the only horse genome sequenced by next-generation sequencing. at 25x sequence coverage, we estimated that approximately 85-88% of the horse's genome could be genotyped  <cit> . our analysis yielded  <dig>  million snps,  <dig> thousand indels, and  <dig> cnvs. despite the fact that approximately 10% of the novel homozygous snps likely reflect errors in the reference genome  and that our false discovery rate  for snp detection is approximately  <dig> % , the genetic variants identified here represent a significant addition to what is currently available for studies in horses. it should be noted that the breeding structure of quarter horses and thoroughbreds, as well as the differences in sequencing technology  most likely contributed to the increased amount of genetic variation identified in this study. we suspect that many genetic variants were missed due to the parameters applied during our variant detection . to minimize this false negative rate  we provide a list of snps and indels using a less stringent calling criterion . however, caution should be used with these variants as the fdr is expected to increase with a reduced minimum coverage, although not directly proportional to the decrease of the fnr.

de novo assembly of reads not mapping to the assembled or un-assembled chromosomes led to the generation of  <dig>  mb of new horse genomic sequence. our analysis of cnvs in horses and cattle using array comparative genomic hybridization , as well as studies in the human and mouse show that large  deletions are common variants in the genome  <cit> . this presence/absence variation  <cit>  is common, and thus we suspect that some percentage of the de novo assembled sequence represents sequence missing from the reference thoroughbred genome due to homozygous deletions.

functional annotation clustering analysis of genetic variants revealed that pathways for sensory perception, signal transduction, protein processing, cellular process, and immunity and defense were differentially affected by each type of genetic variant , suggesting varying degrees of tolerance and selection for genetic variants underlying these biological processes. genes involved in sensory perception pathways contained most of the genetic variation, primarily snps  and cnvs . the observed enrichment in sensory perception genes may be related to selection of the quarter horse for a relatively calm disposition  <cit> , although this is highly speculative at this point, and will only be determined by future population based-studies. conversely, these variants could reflect misassemblies in the reference genome or misalignments in the quarter horse reads to the reference sequence, as these genes exist as large families with numerous pseudogenes.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first sequencing of a horse genome by next-generation sequencing and the first genomic sequence of an individual quarter horse. the genetic variants identified in this study will be a useful resource for future studies to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and disease in equids.
