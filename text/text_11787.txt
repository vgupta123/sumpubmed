BACKGROUND
fruiting body formation in ascomycetes is a complex process leading to the formation of a number of specialized cell types from a comparatively undifferentiated vegetative mycelium  <cit> . recently, the molecular basis of this process has been investigated by forward and reverse genetics approaches, and a number of genes that are essential for fruiting body development have been identified. however, a coherent picture of fungal multicellular development has yet to emerge  <cit> .

one avenue towards a deeper understanding of developmental processes is by functional genomics analyses, e.g. microarray studies. such approaches can help to identify genes that are regulated differentially during fruiting body development and are therefore candidates for further functional analysis. in a previous study, we have performed microarray analyses of fruiting body development in s. macrospora  <cit> . this ascomycete is homothallic and produces fruiting bodies called perithecia within seven days under laboratory conditions. s. macrospora is a close relative of n. crassa, but in contrast to n. crassa, it does not produce any asexual spores. therefore, changes of gene expression patterns during sexual development are not superimposed by changes related to asexual sporulation. we have previously analyzed gene expression in three developmental mutants of s. macrospora, and have identified a number of genes that are downregulated in the sterile mutants when compared with the wild type  <cit> . one of these genes is tap <dig> . tap <dig> transcript levels are downregulated in the three developmental mutants pro <dig>  pro <dig> and pro <dig> as well as in all three double mutants which led us to speculate that the gene might be involved in sexual development in s. macrospora. in addition to this intriguing expression pattern, the derived tap <dig> amino acid sequence shows homology to lectins from other filamentous fungi with the highest similarity to lectins isolated from fruiting bodies of several basidiomycetes  <cit> . it has long been speculated that lectins play a role in fungal development; however, as no mutants in lectin-encoding genes from fruiting body-producing fungi have been analyzed to date, definite proof for this hypothesis is lacking  <cit> . the only known fungal lectin mutant is a strain of arthrobotrys oligospora in which the lectin gene aol was deleted  <cit> . this mutant does not exhibit any phenotypical differences from the wild type under all conditions investigated, but as no sexual cycle is known for a. oligospora, the question whether aol might be involved in fruiting body development could not be addressed. here, we present data on the expression of the s. macrospora tap <dig> gene as well as the characterization of a tap <dig> knockout strain to address the role of a putative lectin in fungal sexual development.

RESULTS
expression of tap <dig> during sexual development in s. macrospora
previously, we reported that tap <dig> is downregulated in several developmental mutants when compared with the wild type  <cit> . in that analysis, all strains were grown under conditions that allowed sexual development, i.e. in floating culture. to investigate whether tap <dig> expression in the wild type is associated with sexual development, we compared transcript levels of tap <dig> in sexually developing mycelia with vegetative mycelia. for this purpose, the wild type was grown in floating or in submerged culture where it develops either fruiting bodies or vegetative mycelium, respectively. analysis of tap <dig> expression by quantitative real time pcr revealed that tap <dig> transcript levels are upregulated nearly 60-fold in mycelia undergoing sexual development . these data further confirm that tap <dig> expression is linked with fruiting body development in s. macrospora.

sequence analysis of the s. macrospora tap <dig> gene
for previous expression analyses, part of the tap <dig> open reading frame was amplified from s. macrospora genomic dna by pcr  <cit> . for further characterization of tap <dig>  we have isolated a tap1-containing cosmid clone from an indexed cosmid library of s. macrospora  <cit> . a  <dig>  kb restriction fragment carrying the tap <dig> open reading frame and adjacent regions was subcloned and sequenced. the fragment carries the uninterrupted tap <dig> open reading frame of  <dig> bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids. in addition, the fragment contains part of another open reading frame downstream of tap <dig> that was named ibl <dig>  due to its similarity to an importin beta subunit. the sequenced region is syntenic to a region within the n. crassa genome that contains the open reading frames ncu <dig>  and ncu <dig>  that are orthologs of tap <dig> and ibl <dig> respectively . in a previous comparison of  <dig> protein-coding genes of s. macrospora and n. crassa, the average nucleic acid identity within coding regions was found to be close to  <dig> %, and even non-coding regions of these two closely related pyrenomycetes can be readily aligned  <cit> . these findings are further supported by our analysis of the genomic region containing tap <dig> .

the predicted tap <dig> polypeptide was used for blastp  <cit>  searches of the public databases, and a multiple alignment was constructed of tap <dig> and several of its closest homologs from other fungi . the closest homolog is the predicted protein ncu <dig>  from n. crassa; however, interestingly, the second-best sequence identity is found in two lectins from the basidiomycetes xerocomus chrysenteron and paxillus involutus. surprisingly, lectins and predicted lectin-like proteins from the ascomycetes podospora anserina, fusarium graminearum, and a. oligospora are less similar to the s. macrospora tap <dig> even though these fungi are much more closely related to s. macrospora than the basidiomycetes . however, the  lectins from p. anserina, f. graminearum, and a. oligospora have a higher similarity compared to the basidiomycete lectins than tap <dig> does . these findings might indicate that tap <dig> and its corresponding n. crassa ortholog, even though being clearly members of this fungal lectin family, have evolved rather fast compared to other ascomycete homologs.

construction of a Δtap <dig> strain
a construct for generating a tap <dig> deletion strain was generated. it consists of a hygromycin resistance cassette flanked by about  <dig> kb of sequences upstream and downstream of the tap <dig> open reading frame . the construct was used to transform the s. macrospora wild type, and transformants were screened for homologous recombination by pcr with oligonucleotide pairs d <dig> and d <dig> as well as d <dig> and d <dig> . these primer combinations yield amplicons only in the case of homologous recombination. among  <dig> primary transformants, one transformant was found that displayed the expected pcr fragments . ascospores from this transformant were isolated to purify the putative knockout strain, and southern blot analysis of nine ascospore isolates was performed with probes for tap <dig> and the hygromycin resistance gene hph. for two of the ascospore isolates, t <dig>  and t <dig> , results are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, the tap <dig> probe hybridized to a  <dig>  kb bglii fragment in genomic dna of the wild type, whereas no hybridization signal was obtained with genomic dna from the knockout strains t <dig>  and t <dig> . conversely, the hph probe marked a  <dig>  kb bglii fragment in the knockout strains and produced no signal with wild type dna. the  <dig>  kb fragment is of the size expected in a strain where homologous recombination has taken place . the Δtap <dig> strains t <dig>  and t <dig>  were used for further analysis.

phenotypic characterization of the Δtap <dig> strain in different genetic backgrounds
the tap <dig> deletion strains t <dig>  and t <dig>  were analyzed with respect to their phenotype during the sexual cycle. surprisingly, both were completely wild type-like in all aspects of fruiting body development, i.e. both tap <dig> deletion strains produced mature perithecia in the same numbers and in the same amount of time as the wild type. moreover, neither perithecial nor spore morphology were altered in any recognizable way . fruiting body formation took place both in constant light as well as in constant darkness both on complete as well as minimal media, similar to that of the wild type. ascospores from the knockout strains germinated readily and were black like wild type spores .

we then investigated whether there were any phenotypes unrelated to sexual development present in the mutant strains. mycelial growth rates were determined as  <dig>   and  <dig>   mm per day for Δtap <dig> and wild type respectively; thus, indicating that mycelial growth is not altered in the knockout strains. also, renewal of growth and fruiting body development after incubation at 4°c or 37°c, conditions that prevent growth and fruiting body formation, respectively, was not different in the mutants when compared to the wild type . also, wettability of mycelium and fruiting bodies was similar in wild type and mutants indicating that the hydrophobic coating of the mycelium was not altered in the knockout strains. as the lack of tap <dig> did not cause any discernable phenotype, we wondered whether tap <dig> might have a redundant function or whether its absence might be masked by the presence of other genes. we therefore crossed the Δtap <dig> allele into strains bearing mutations in other developmental genes, namely pro <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  and pro <dig>  the pro <dig> mutant is defective in a gene encoding a transcription factor  <cit> , the pro <dig> mutant lacks a functional wd <dig> repeat protein  <cit> , and pro <dig> and pro <dig> are mutants non-allelic to tap <dig> or the other pro genes . tap <dig> transcript levels are downregulated in mutants pro <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  <cit> , and pro <dig> . thus, we speculated whether a complete lack of tap <dig> would lead to a more pronounced developmental phenotype, especially as several other developmental genes are also downregulated in the pro mutants  <cit> . we obtained double mutants with strains pro <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  and pro <dig> and verified the presence of the Δtap <dig> allele in the double mutants by southern blot analysis . all double mutant strains were phenotypically similar to the respective single pro mutants in that they produced only protoperithecia and were therefore sterile. there were no differences in the number of protoperithecia produced by the double mutants when compared with the single mutants. also, growth rates of the vegetative mycelium as well as overall morphological appearance were the same . for the crosses of the tap <dig> knockout with the pro mutant strains and subsequent back-crosses, we analyzed a total of  <dig> full tetrads and  <dig> partial tetrads from crosses with different mutant strains and in all cases found the expected 1: <dig> segregation pattern for each of the single markers . this is a further indication that deletion of tap <dig> does not interfere with sexual development, and also shows that the process of generating the Δtap <dig> allele did not introduce further mutations into the strains that would cause any different segregation patterns. overall, no phenotype for Δtap <dig> was found in any of the genetic backgrounds investigated.

discussion
the tap1-encoded polypeptide from s. macrospora has significant homology to lectins and lectin-like protein from other fungi . the highest degree of amino acid identity is found in comparison with lectins that were isolated from fruiting bodies of several basidiomycetes  <cit> . lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are found in a variety of organisms  <cit> . on the basis of sequence homology, the s. macrospora tap <dig> polypeptide can be included into a class of fungal lectins; however, whether it has lectin activity, i.e. whether it specifically binds carbohydrates, remains to be elucidated. interestingly, tap <dig> displays a greater sequence identity towards basidiomycete lectins than to lectins or putative lectins from ascomycetes with the  exception of its closest homolog, the n. crassa protein ncu <dig>  . however, blast searches in the n. crassa genome  <cit>  with the sequences of tap <dig> as well as the lectin sequences from the other fungi used in our sequence comparisons yielded only ncu <dig>  as a significant result . this finding indicates that the gene is present as a single copy in n. crassa, and that there is no other member of this lectin gene family present in the n. crassa genome. as n. crassa and s. macrospora are close relatives with highly syntenic genomes  <cit> , it is likely that this is the case in s. macrospora as well. this observation is supported by the fact that only a single band in s. macrospora genomic dna hybridizes with a tap <dig> probe . thus, it seems that this particular class of fungal lectins has evolved faster in s. macrospora and n. crassa compared to other ascomycetes, for which it still retains more similarity with its basidiomycete relatives . another class of fungal lectins has been found in the basidiomycete coprinus cinereus. these lectins bind galactose and are therefore called galectins, and two galectins from c. cinereus are specifically expressed during different stages of fruiting body formation  <cit> . however, blast searches for galectin homologs in the n. crassa genome yielded no significant results  indicating that no galectin-like proteins exist in n. crassa or that their sequences are too dissimilar to the c. cinereus sequences to be detected by sequence comparisons alone. thus, the n. crassa ncu <dig>  gene and its s. macrospora ortholog tap <dig> are so far the only genes encoding putative lectins that have been identified by sequence analysis in these two ascomycetes.

in fungi, most lectins have been isolated from basidiomycetes, especially from mushroom fruiting bodies, and it has been speculated that they play a role in fruiting body development  <cit> . however, as no lectin mutant in a fruiting body-producing fungus has been characterized to date, this hypothesis has not been verified experimentally. previous investigations and the results presented here show that tap <dig> transcript levels are closely correlated with fruiting body development in s. macrospora; therefore, we decided to construct a tap <dig> knockout strain to analyze whether this putative lectin plays a role in fruiting body formation. a Δtap <dig> strain was generated by gene replacement, but the knockout strain has no discernable phenotype under all conditions investigated. this might indicate that tap <dig> has indeed no function in vegetative growth or sexual development of s. macrospora; however, the possibility that tap <dig> is needed under environmental conditions not tested in our experiments or that its function is redundant or that in the absence of tap <dig>  another gene product can take its place, cannot be excluded. the latter effect is well known in other organisms, and it was, for example, tested in a large-scale analysis of yeast synthetic lethal interactions where it was found that genes involved in similar biological processes, but not necessarily in the same regulatory pathway, can buffer one another in single mutant backgrounds but show a phenotype in the double mutant strain  <cit> . to test whether any of the known developmental genes of s. macrospora show this kind of genetic interaction with tap <dig>  we obtained double mutants of Δtap <dig> with strains bearing mutations in the developmental genes pro <dig>  pro <dig>  pro <dig>  or pro <dig>  however, all double mutant strains were phenotypically similar to the respective pro mutant strains. tap <dig> transcript levels are downregulated in the pro mutants, and our analysis demonstrates that even the complete loss of tap <dig> does not worsen the condition of the mutants. this leaves open the possibility that tap <dig> is necessary in a different genetic background or under different environmental conditions.

with respect to fruiting body formation, our results show that the putative lectin-encoding gene tap <dig> is not an essential gene for this developmental process. as mentioned previously, the only other known fungal lectin mutant is the aol mutant of the nematode-trapping fungus a. oligospora  <cit> . similar to our findings, the aol mutant also has no phenotype under all conditions investigated. since no sexual stages from a. oligospora are known, these observations do not include fruiting body formation; however, vegetative growth, conidiation, and nematode-trapping were unchanged in the aol mutant strain  <cit> . thus, possible functions of this class of lectins and lectin-like proteins in filamentous fungi remain enigmatic.

CONCLUSIONS
tap <dig> expression is strongly associated with sexual development in s. macrospora. an analysis of the tap <dig> gene and its surrounding genomic region revealed a high degree of sequence identity and overall synteny with the corresponding region in the genome of n. crassa. sequence comparisons of tap <dig> with lectins and lectin-like proteins from other fungi indicate that it is most closely related to lectins isolated from basidiomycete fruiting bodies. however, analysis of a tap <dig> knockout strain shows that tap <dig> is not essential for fruiting body formation nor vegetative growth in s. macrospora. this is the case for a Δtap <dig> allele in an otherwise wild type genetic background as well as in combination with mutations in several developmental genes. whether tap <dig> has any function under growth conditions not investigated here, e.g. in a more natural setting, remains to be elucidated.
