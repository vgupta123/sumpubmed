BACKGROUND
globally, gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, and is the most prevalent cancer in south korea. in the past two decades, the mortality and incidence of gastric cancer has decreased gradually but it is still the second most common cancer in asia
 <cit> . most stomach cancers are an adenocarcinoma type, which accounts approximately 90%
 <cit> . the well-established risk factors are helicobacter pylori-infection and cigarette smoking, and the role of dietary factors has also been suggested
 <cit> . the most widely used treatments for stomach cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. the available treatments are not effective and recuperation is also still problematic. hence, there is an urgency to apply new therapeutic agents to increase survival rates of gastric cancer patients.

vitamin c  is an essential nutrient of most living tissues, and readily acts as a strong reducing agent
 <cit> . epidemiological studies have reported that vitamin c deficiency in humans are linked to more severe h. pylori-associated gastritis and a gastric cancer risk is also higher
 <cit> . the study reported that supplementation of vitamin c has been associated with reduced gastric cancer risk in humans. in addition, a reduced risk for most types of cancer is associated with a high intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, which contain vitamin c
 <cit> . despite, the controversial cancer treatment history, the in-vitro studies reported that ascorbate induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in various tumor cells
 <cit> . however, the exact mechanism of vitamin c involved in cancer treatment is not fully elucidated.

a global proteomic approach is being extensively applied in cancer research
 <cit> . this approach uses a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , image analysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight  mass spectrometry , and bioinformatics analyses to comprehensively resolve, identify, and characterize proteins in the cells, tissues and animal models. these high-throughput proteome techniques allow us to examine the changes in protein expression of ags cells in response to vitamin c. identification of differentially expressed proteins is important to understand the molecular events involved in vitamin c anti-cancer mechanism and protective effects, as well as brings new insights into ags carcinogenesis. regarding gastric cancer, proteome analysis has been reported mainly in kato-iii and epg 85– <dig> human gastric cancer cell lines
 <cit> . 2-de maps have also permitted to obtain an overview of the expressed proteins in the human stomach
 <cit> . also, proteome analysis has been carried out in  <dig> human gastric cancer samples to find the biomarkers of gastric cancer
 <cit> . however, no 2-de proteome of vitamin c-treated ags cells have hitherto been reported.

our previous study demonstrated that vitamin c induced apoptosis in human adenocarcinoma ags cells at pharmacological concentrations, and inhibited ags cells proliferation
 <cit> . in the present study, we perform a proteome analysis of ags cells treated with vitamin c at pharmacological concentrations  and the control , and  <dig> different expressed proteins were identified by maldi-tof/ms. also, the expression of isoforms of 14-3- <dig> proteins was confirmed by immuno-blotting. the cytotoxicity assay suggests that vitamin c inhibited ags cells growth and proteome results revealed that apoptosis related proteins were involved in promoting and regulating cell death of ags cells.

protein detection, analysis, and in-gel digestion
the gels were stained with silver nitrate, similar to the method described by swain and ross
 <cit>  with slight modifications. three independent gels were performed in triplicate. gels were scanned and image analysis was performed, using progenesis samespots software . using this software, the differentially expressed spots were identified by automatic matching of the detected protein spots. those spots differing significantly  in their intensities with a fold-change ≥ <dig> were used for further analysis. selected protein spots were excised manually from the two-dimensional electrophoresis  gel and protein digestion was performed
 <cit>  with slight modifications. briefly, the excised gel pieces were washed with  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> for  <dig> min, and then dehydrated in  <dig> μl of acetonitrile for  <dig> min. after being dried in a lyophilizer , the gel pieces were rehydrated in 5– <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> containing  <dig> ng/μl trypsin  on ice. after  <dig> min, the trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 10– <dig> μl of  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> without trypsin, and digestion was carried out for a minimum of  <dig> h at 37°c. these peptide mixtures were collected and analyzed by a mass spectrometry.

RESULTS
growth inhibition of ags cells by vitamin c
to evaluate the effects of growth inhibition and survival of ags cells, the ags cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations  of vitamin c for  <dig> h. vitamin c had a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of ags cells in a dose-dependent manner when compared to the control, after  <dig> h treatment with vitamin c . especially, vitamin c at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml decreased the cell growth by approximately 50%, 36% and 27%, respectively. therefore, the ic <dig>  of vitamin c was found to be approximately  <dig> μg/ml. moreover, microscopic observations revealed morphological changes in ags cells, such as cell shrinkage and density compared with the control cells . further, 2-de gel analysis was performed to study the protein expressions in ags cells due to inhibitory effects of vitamin c.

proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in vitamin c-treated ags cells
we performed a proteomic approach to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in vitamin c treated  ags cells,  <dig> μg of total proteins were separated by ief on  <dig> cm ipg strips in the first dimension and 12% sds-page in the second dimension. we observed a total of approximately  <dig> protein spots in silver stained gels. control  and vitamin c treated gels were analyzed by using progenesis samespots software , and we found  <dig> statistically significant differentially expressed protein spots . these  <dig> differentially expressed proteins spots were chosen for further analysis by maldi-tof/ms. finally,  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified by using the mascot search engine and the swissprot database .

of these  <dig> proteins, six were up-regulated and fourteen were down-regulated in vitamin c-treated ags cells compared with the control. down-regulated proteins involved in cell motility included tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain  and tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain , whereas xin actin-binding repeat-containing protein  <dig>  was up-regulated. in addition, the peroxiredoxin- <dig>  and thioredoxin domain-containing protein  <dig>  were involved in antioxidant and detoxification, which was up-regulated. while proteins participating in signal transduction were significantly down-regulated, including 14-3- <dig> protein sigma , 14-3- <dig> protein epsilon  and 14-3- <dig> protein zeta/delta , whereas tnfaip3-interacting protein  <dig>  was up-regulated. proteins involved in protein metabolism eukaryotic translation initiation factor  <dig> subunit k , proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig>  and proteasome subunit beta type- <dig>  were down-regulated. further, we showed the enlarged 2-de images of  <dig> important protein spots, one spot  was up-regulated and the other five  were down-regulated in the vitamin c-treated ags cells compared with the control .

validation of expression of 14-3- <dig> isoforms by immunoblotting
recent research on cancer targets have focused 14-3- <dig> proteins that are known to be involved in various biological processes like signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cellular metabolism, proliferation, cytoskeletal regulation, transcription, and redox-regulation or stress response. the ags cells were treated with vitamin c  and the expression of 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ were examined by immuno-blotting. quantification of the protein bands revealed that the expression of 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ were decreased in the vitamin c-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated control group . these data indicated that vitamin c decreased the expression of 14-3- <dig> isoforms  in ags cells.

discussion
apart from antioxidant activity, vitamin c plays an effective role of cancer prevention and treatment. the numerous studies have reported that vitamin c prevents cell proliferation and metastasis of many human cancer cells
 <cit> . but, it’s exact molecular mechanisms still has not been fully elucidated. in the previous study, we demonstrated that vitamin c at pharmacological concentration induced apoptosis in ags cells, mainly through the down-regulation of 14–3-3σ protein and dephosphorylation bad proteins via a mitochondrial dependent pathway
 <cit> . in the present study, we performed 2-de analysis coupled with maldi-tof/ms of ags cells treated with vitamin c at a pharmacological concentration  and the control , and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified. proteomic analysis revealed that the apoptosis related proteins were involved in promoting and regulating cell death of ags cells.

ascorbic acid is an excellent antioxidant and ascorbate caused toxicity to cancer cells, but had no effect on normal cells at the same concentration
 <cit> . in the present study, vitamin c had a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of ags cells in a dose-dependent manner after  <dig> h treatment with vitamin c , and the ic <dig> of vitamin c was found approximately  <dig> μg/ml or  <dig>  mm/ml. and also, morphological changes were observed in ags cells, such as cell shrinkage and density in vitamin c treated cells compared with the control cells . this result revealed that vitamin c inhibited ags cell growth at pharmacological concentrations. further, 2-de gel analysis was performed to study the protein expressions in ags cells due to inhibitory effects of vitamin c. the silver stained gels of control  and vitamin c treated gels were analyzed by using progenesis samespots software , and we found  <dig> statistically significant differentially expressed protein spots . finally,  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified by maldi-tof/ms analysis using the mascot search engine and the swissprot database . among  <dig> proteins, six were up-regulated and fourteen were down-regulated in vitamin c-treated ags cells compared with the control. these proteins are mainly involved in cell mobility, antioxidant and detoxification, signal transduction and protein metabolism.

vitamin c down-regulated proteins involved in the signal transduction, 14-3- <dig> isoforms
research on cancer targets have determined that 14-3- <dig> proteins are known to be involved in various biological processes like signal transduction, cell cycle control, apoptosis, cellular metabolism, proliferation, cytoskeletal regulation, transcription, and redox-regulation or stress response
 <cit> . among these differentially expressed proteins, three isoforms of 14-3- <dig> proteins, 14-3-3σ and 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ were down-regulated . the bad protein, a proapoptotic family member, is one of the targets of 14-3- <dig> proteins
 <cit> . when bad disassociated from 14-3- <dig>  the bad is found localized to the mitochondria bound to bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl, and induced cell death
 <cit> . in addition, vitamin c induced apoptosis by down-regulation of 14–3-3σ and dephosphorylation of bad via a mitochondrial dependent pathway in ags cells
 <cit> . moreover, the remarkable dissociation of bad from 14-3-3β is the apoptosis mechanism of vitamin c through the increasing of er stress and the translocation of bad to mitochondria after dissociation from 14-3-3β in human colon cancer cell line, hct-8
 <cit> . these findings suggest that bad dissociated from 14-3- <dig> is a key mediator in vitamin c-induced apoptosis through the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential.

the down-regulation of 14-3-3σ protein has been reported in many types of cancer, including breast cancer
 <cit> , and expression is frequently lost in other human epithelial carcinomas
 <cit> . moreover, other 14-3-3ϵ, ζ, γ, β, θ isoforms have also been identified in cancer
 <cit> . after dna-damage, 14-3-3σ down-regulated cells fail to maintain a g2/m arrest and undergo a mitotic catastrophe, which results in apoptosis
 <cit> . the reduction of 14-3-3ζ expression induced the g <dig> arrest, which leads to mitotic catastrophe and increase radio sensitivity
 <cit> . to verify the expressions of identified proteins, we performed an immuno-blotting analysis on 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ, which have been suggested to be involved in various cancers. quantification of the protein bands determined that the expression of 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ were decreased in the vitamin c-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated control group . these data indicated that vitamin c decreased the expression of 14-3- <dig> isoforms  in ags cells. these data suggest that down-regulation of 14-3- <dig> could be a useful information in therapeutic targets of human gastric cancers.

vitamin c down-regulated the cytoskeleton and associated proteins, tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain and tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain proteins
tropomyosins are actin-binding proteins that can integrate cell mechanics and signaling essential for cellular migration and invasion. proteomic studies showed that the expression of tropomyosin changes, which suggest an important role for tropomyosin in maintaining cell shape
 <cit> . in addition, tropomyosins increase filament stiffness, stabilize actin filaments by protecting them against the severing action of gelsolin and cofilin
 <cit> . in our  <dig> d gel system, the spots corresponding to tropomyosin  <dig> and tropomyosin  <dig> showed a decreased expression in the response to vitamin c . these decreased changes in the tropomyosins expression might be coincidental with morphologic changes and migratory characteristics of ags cells in response to vitamin c.

vitamin c up-regulated the antioxidant proteins, peroxiredoxin- <dig> and thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5
generally, antioxidant proteins play a pivotal role in the antioxidant defense system and protect the cells from oxidative stress. there are six peroxiredoxins found in mammalians, and peroxiredoxin  <dig>  is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum 
 <cit> . in the present study, antioxidant and detoxification proteins, like peroxiredoxin- <dig> and thioredoxin domain-containing protein  <dig>  were over expressed in vitamin c treated ags cells . since, vitamin c is an excellent antioxidant that increased antioxidant protein expressions in ags cells and protects from oxidative stress. to our knowledge there has not been a reported study regarding peroxiredoxin- <dig> protein expression in human gastric cancer adenocarcinoma ags cells response to vitamin c. therefore, a detailed study is necessary regarding the effects of vitamin c on peroxiredoxin- <dig> protein expressions and the role of peroxiredoxin- <dig> protein in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer.

vitamin c altered the proteins involved in protein metabolism
also, we found that eif3k was down-regulated in vitamin c-treated ags cells. a previous study has been reported that the down-regulation of eif3k attenuating apoptosis in simple epithelial cells
 <cit> . tumor necrosis factor  alpha-induced protein  <dig>  or tnfaip <dig> is a novel tumor suppressor protein and a key player in the negative feedback regulation of nf-kb signaling in response to multiple stimuli. tnfaip <dig> also regulates tnf-induced apoptosis
 <cit> . moreover, tnfaip <dig> induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis, accompanied by down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappa b  activation
 <cit> . presently, tnfaip <dig> was up-regulated in vitamin c treated ags cells. figure 
 <dig> represents the overview of the growth inhibition effect of vitamin c on ags cells and protein expression patterns. these proteomic results reveal that vitamin c inhibited cell growth, and apoptosis related proteins were involved in promoting and regulating cell death in ags cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, vitamin c showed strong inhibitory effect on ags cell growth at pharmacological concentrations , and  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified in ags cells after exposure to vitamin c by using 2-de and madli-tof analysis. in particular, proteins involved in signal transduction 14-3-3σ, 14-3-3ϵ and 14-3-3δ, and cytoskeletal proteins tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain and tropomyosin alpha- <dig> chain were down-regulated; peroxiredoxin- <dig> was up-regulated in vitamin c-treated ags cells compared with the control. further, the expressions of 14-3- <dig> isoforms  were verified with a western blot analysis. the findings of this study suggest that vitamin c could inhibit ags cell growth, alter the apoptosis related proteins, and might be helpful to understand the molecular mechanism of vitamin c ’s anti-tumor effect in ags cells.
