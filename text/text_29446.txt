BACKGROUND
an ovarian primordial follicle is composed of an inactive oocyte surrounded by granulosa cells all enclosed by a basal lamina. once activated the follicle grows by enlargement of the oocyte and replication of the granulosa cells from about  <dig> cells to  <dig> million cells in the cow  <cit> . during growth, a fluid-filled antrum or cavity also develops in the middle of the follicle  <cit>  and bovine follicles need to enlarge to over 10 mm in diameter, principally by antrum expansion, to be capable of ovulation. ovulation occurs only once per oestrous cycle. however, instead of one primordial follicle growing to the necessary size and then ovulating, many follicles commence growth during the course of the cycle. the vast majority of these growing follicles become atretic leaving in cows only one, or occasionally two, follicles to ovulate. the process of follicle growth during a cycle is not random either, since two or three groups or waves of follicles emerge from a pool of follicles of approximately 5 mm in diameter during each oestrous cycle  <cit> . during these maturational waves, follicles continue to enlarge over several days until one follicle that is growing faster and is hence larger than the others gains dominance  <cit> . thus a deviation in the size of follicles occurs when they are around 7–8 mm in diameter  <cit> . as the larger dominant follicle continues to expand further, the smaller follicles in the wave undergo atresia. if the wave is at the end of a cycle the dominant follicle ovulates and a new cycle is initiated. in earlier waves the dominant follicle also eventually undergoes atresia and another wave then ensues.

during growth of the follicle, the granulosa cells undergo a number of maturational changes. early in follicle development they secrete the hormone inhibin and later at the pre-ovulatory sizes, oestradiol. the cells also express follicle-stimulating hormone receptors soon after follicle activation and then during the course of dominance they additionally express luteinising hormone receptors . the process of dominance is not well understood largely because it is not possible to trace the cellular changes that occur within a follicle in real time in order to relate the events preceding development to future outcomes, such as predicting whether an individual follicle will become dominant or subordinate. another recent approach compared identical-sized follicles before deviation into dominant and subordinate follicles and analysed gene expression  <cit> . in that study a firm hypothesis was investigated and it was found that follicles with the highest level of cyp11a <dig>  encoding the rate limiting enzyme for progesterone synthesis, also had the highest level of cyp19a <dig>  encoding the rate-limiting enzyme for oestradiol synthesis  <cit> . it also had the highest expression level of three genes , encoding components of an unusual basal lamina matrix, focimatrix   <cit> . it was concluded that since these five genes continue to be further up regulated in dominant and preovulatory-size follicles and because the expression levels of these genes were correlated with each other, that focimatrix production and cyp11a <dig> expression might be important in a follicle gaining dominance  <cit> .

focimatrix develops as aggregates of basal lamina material deposited between the granulosa cells and contains the α <dig> and α <dig> chains of collagen type iv, laminin α <dig>  β <dig> and γ <dig> chains, nidogen- <dig> and − <dig>  perlecan, collagen type xviii and usherin, but not versican  <cit> . these components are similar to those found in the follicular basal lamina at the stage of follicular development when focimatrix is first observed  <cit> . focimatrix initially appears in bovine follicles greater than 5 mm in diameter, and the amount of focimatrix increases with increasing follicular size  <cit> . this first appearance of focimatrix occurs as follicles emerge in a growth wave, and prior to emergence of the dominant follicle.

the aim of this study, therefore, was to identify the important processes occurring at the key stages of antral follicle development at the time 1) prior to follicles entering a wave and 2) prior to ovulation, by gene expression array profiling. in order to gain a greater knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for granulosa cell maturation and selection of dominant follicles there have been several transcriptome analyses of bovine granulosa cells  <cit> . evans and colleagues  <cit>  examined dominant and subordinate follicles  by two-color hybridisation on a self -generated array containing approximately  <dig>  putative genes. serial analysis of gene expression  tags were examined in follicles of a larger size  around the time of deviation for selection of the dominant follicle  <cit> . skinner et al.  <cit>  isolated healthy antral follicles at three different sizes, and used pooled follicle rna to hybridise to individual arrays. liu et al.  <cit>  was also interested in selection of the dominant follicle using a two color array, but did not separate the granulosa and thecal compartments for analysis. subordinate, dominant and preovulatory follicles have also been examined by rna-seq and the effects of lactation examined on gene expression pathways  <cit> . more recently, christenson et al.  <cit>  also used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression in bovine antral follicles before and after the lh surge. only in one of these studies were comparisons made between small follicles, less than 5 mm in diameter, and larger follicles, but the analysis may have been compromised by a lack of statistical power . smaller follicles represent those before focimatrix is expressed and before follicles have entered a wave. hence we chose to compare these smaller follicles with larger preovulatory-size follicles; all of which were validated as healthy. additionally we ensured that the isolated granulosa cells were devoid of any potentially contaminating theca cells.

RESULTS
selection of follicles for analyses
to ensure accurate comparisons were made between granulosa cells from small  versus large  follicles, only antral follicles of healthy morphology  <cit>  were selected for this study. confirmation of health stage was also performed on large follicles showing cyp19a <dig> expression assessed by qrt-pcr similar to that observed in healthy large follicles using microarray analysis   <cit> . to ensure that the isolated granulosa cells were not contaminated with any thecal cells the level of cyp17a <dig> was measured. cyp17a <dig> is expressed exclusively in thecal cells  <cit> . no follicles with more than 1% level of expression of cyp17a <dig> found in thecal samples were included in the analysis. since there were some low yields of rna, three of the samples of small follicles were pools of two follicles, each from the same animal.

validation of microarray data
to confirm changes in the expression of genes identified by microarray analysis, quantitative rt-pcr analyses of cyp19a <dig> were performed on the same samples. similar to that observed in microarray analysis, the expression of cyp19a <dig> was significantly increased in granulosa cells isolated from large follicles compared to granulosa cells isolated from small follicles . the microarray analyses also identified genes well known to be up regulated across the sizes of follicles examined. some examples of these include hormone-related genes cyp11a <dig> , hsd3b <dig> , lhcgr  and inhba  and focimatrix genes col4a <dig>  and lama <dig>  as shown previously  <cit>  .

statistical analyses of gene expression
granulosa from small healthy follicles were from one of two groups having either columnar  or rounded  shaped basally-situated granulosa cells as described in the methods. principal component analysis  for the first three components  and hierarchical clustering  for the total number of probe sets  of all arrays in this study was conducted. neither of these unsupervised analytical methods separated the small healthy follicle arrays into the rounded and columnar groups, and in fact no genes were shown to be more than 2-fold differentially expressed between the two subgroups with a benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  of p <  <dig>  by anova. therefore, the small healthy follicles were treated as a single group for further analyses  and compared with the group of large follicles . it can be clearly seen that the large follicles clustered comparatively closely together and differed from the small healthy follicles, which appeared to be more variable across the group. this was also reflected in the hierarchical clustering analysis . seven hundred and fifty eight probe sets were found to be differentially expressed between small and large follicles, when a p <  <dig>  and an arbitrary threshold of 3-fold minimum differential expression was applied . these consisted of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated probe sets in large with respect to small follicles. the fact that substantially more genes were up regulated than down regulated in large healthy follicles, could indicate that activation rather than a reduction in additional pathways occurs as follicles enlarge.

variability of gene expression
the coefficient of variation  for each gene in small and in large follicles in both the complete probe set and the >2-fold differentially regulated probe set were calculated. the cv-frequency distribution plots are shown in figure  <dig>  the small follicles  had more genes that were variably expressed, particularly for the genes whose expression was >2-fold differentially regulated between small and large follicles . furthermore, when we repeated the analysis using only the genes whose signal intensities were in the top 50% on the array we still observed a shift to increased variation, thus demonstrating that this property is inherent in the small follicles rather than possibly due to overall lower array intensities . the higher variability in gene expression in the small follicle granulosa cells indicates that either the cells in small follicles were less uniform in their gene expression, or that small follicles were less uniform or a combination of both. the more variably expressed genes were up regulated during follicle enlargement which indicates that the reduction in variability of gene expression and their up regulation are potentially both important processes in follicle maturation.

differentially expressed genes
a list of genes which were differentially regulated between small and large healthy follicles  was examined in detail. we were able to identify genes which were well characterised during follicle development, and known to be differentially regulated between small and large follicles in our microarray analyses which included lhcgr <cit> , progesterone receptor  <cit> , inhba <cit>  and the receptor for the lipid mediator prostaglandin f2α   <cit> . in the list  <dig> probe sets could be assigned gene identities in ingenuity pathway analysis  which included those with homology to multiple probe sets, consisting of  <dig> annotated genes, of these  <dig> were up regulated in large follicles  and  <dig> were down regulated . this list was also uploaded to the gene ontology enrichment analysis software toolkit  program.

pathway and network analyses
the top ten canonical pathways generated in ipa and significant go terms indicate a trend toward directional cell growth and extracellular signalling. in particular, the three most significantly associated ipa canonical pathways are axonal guidance , ephrin a and rho gtpase signalling, which are associated with cell attachment and cytoskeletal rearrangement . the il- <dig> signalling pathway , associated with inflammation and acute phase reaction, also contains a number of genes which were activated in large follicles including il6r, jnk, pik3r and tsg <dig> . the go terms enriched for the large to small follicle comparison are also connected with inflammation signalling and cell rearrangement .

the two top networks generated by ipa based on the dataset above are shown in figure  <dig>  the network in figure 5a shows an emphasis on cytoplasmic membrane receptor signalling centred around notch and the adam protease genes and axonal guidance through the robo genes and lrp <dig>  there is also considerable connectivity associated with pi3k which exerts direct effects on the cytoskeleton and indirectly protein translation via ei4ebp <dig>  the other network  indicates significant interaction with extracellular matrix by lama <dig>  lamc <dig> and col4a <dig> which appear to mainly signal through the cell surface components itgb <dig>  cspg <dig> and cdh <dig> to erk pathways. this extracellular matrix pathway is probably that associated with focimatrix production that develops as follicles enlarge from  <dig> to 10 mm in diameter  <cit> .

genes activated in large versus small follicles
tgf-β signalling
it is well known that tgf-β signalling plays an important role in follicular development, as reviewed by knight and glister in  <dig>  <cit>  and more recently by myers and pangas in  <dig>  <cit> . in our study, three members of the tgf-β superfamily, inhba which helps drive androgen production from the theca  <cit>  and inhibits production of fsh by the pituitary  <cit> , and the bone morphogenetic protein receptor genes bmpr1a and bmpr <dig>  were up regulated in large follicles . the bmp receptor type ii binds gdf- <dig> and bmp- <dig>  two critical growth factors for granulosa cells which are secreted by the oocyte at antral stages  <cit> . the activation of these genes probably contributes to follicle growth during the latter antral stages when androgen production is increased and combines with lh to maintain high oestradiol levels following the reduction in circulating levels of fsh when a dominant follicle emerges.

immune/inflammation signalling
the immunoregulatory receptor genes, il4r il6r and il20ra and the thrombin and thrombin-like receptors f2r and f2rl1were also identified among the list of genes activated in large follicles . bovine granulosa cells have been shown to be capable of initiating an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide with increased expression of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, il- <dig> and its receptor have been studied in relation to cumulus-oocyte complex development, where they are known to play an active role in expansion and ovulation  <cit> . the expression of another inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> and its receptor have been shown to increase in the rat preovulatory follicle  <cit> . interestingly, thrombin receptor rna expression has previously been reported to be lower in larger follicles than small  <cit>  as opposed to our study, though the health of the follicles was unclear in the other study. these inflammatory pathways identified as significant in our analysis further confirm that significant signalling through these pathways occurs in the later stages of bovine antral follicle development.

axonal guidance
an interesting subset of the signalling genes active in large follicles is concerned with directional cell growth and cellular processes, mainly through the slit / roundabout or robo  and semaphorin /plexin  pathways . robo <dig> and robo <dig>  and slitrk <dig> are part of the slit-robo pathway, which acts as an important repulsive cellular guidance mechanism to control vascular and mesenchymal tissue development  <cit> . whilst follicles do not have a branching structure, during their growth they are expanding within a stromal tissue, as branching ducts are required to do, suggesting that the semaphorin /plexin  pathway is important in the process of follicle expansion. another up-regulated gene notch <dig>  can similarly affect cell polarity and tissue structure  <cit> .

in fact, these molecules are known to be present in follicle development in the fetal ovary  <cit>  and adult ovarian follicle  <cit> . lrp <dig>  an endocytosis and cholesterol transport participant, was previously found to be more highly expressed in large versus small antral follicles  <cit>  and in the dominant follicle compared with the subordinate and preovulatory follicles  <cit> . lrp <dig> is also crucial for binding ephrins, which are involved with directed growth and cell migration  <cit> . ephrin receptors, including a <dig> and their corresponding ligands, have been demonstrated in human luteinised granulosa cells  <cit> ; but not at earlier stages. the activation of these genes and subsequent axonal guidance pathways identified in our arrays indicate the importance of polarity switching and cell rearrangement as the follicle prepares for ovulation and luteinisation of granulosa cells. ovulation requires that the follicle and cumulus expand and the oocyte migrate to the point of release facing the ovarian surface, which necessitates coordinated signalling between mural and cumulus granulosa and the oocyte.

protein trafficking
molecules involved in protein trafficking constitute another important group within our up-regulated data set , and some of these participate in cell signalling pathways through the pleckstrin homology domain binding proteins plekha <dig>  plekhb <dig>  plekhg <dig> and plekhh <dig>  plekha <dig> is a participant in the phosphoinositidyl-3-phosphate kinase  signalling pathway which is sensitive to superoxide production  <cit> , possibly as a by-product of steroidogenesis.

transcription factors
as the follicle enlarges the granulosa cells mature and we would expect major changes in the types of molecular pathways which are active in the granulosa cells. this is reflected in the high number of transcriptional regulators of developmental processes encoded by genes like foxp <dig>  creb3l <dig>  jarid <dig>  cited <dig> and cited <dig> which are switched on in large follicles . the camp-responsive element binding protein  p <dig> interacting transcriptional modulator cited <dig>  has been shown to be activated by fsh treatment of in vitro matured granulosa cells  <cit> , and cited <dig> encodes a factor which competes with hypoxic inducible factor  for cbpp <dig>  <cit> , and is important for embryonic development of neural tissue  <cit> .

cell growth
many of the genes identified in this study encode proteins responsible for growth and metabolism. several of these are known to be involved in follicular development and confirm previous studies, such as igfbp- <dig> and- <dig>  which were found to be up regulated in granulosa cells isolated from large follicles  <cit>  . other genes such as chordin-like  <dig>  a bmp- <dig> antagonist  <cit> , have not previously been associated with follicular development.

intercellular and matrix adhesion
a number of molecules which create intercellular interactions and/or bind extracellular matrix are also encoded by genes which are listed in table  <dig>  nine extracellular matrix genes were up regulated in large follicles, and encode proteins including collagen types 4α <dig>  and 16α <dig> , and laminin α <dig> , as well as the proteoglycans, versican , cspg <dig> and syndecan  <dig>  . this group also contains the most highly expressed gene from the entire list, tnfaip <dig>  almost 280-fold higher expressed in large follicles . the up-regulated molecules which bind matrix or stabilise intercellular attachment, are represented by the tetraspanins  <dig> and  <dig> , the rho gtpase activating proteins- <dig> and − <dig> , and the well-known cell surface antigens, integrin β <dig>  and vcam <dig>  amongst others. integrin β <dig> is expressed in mature follicles in the mouse  <cit>  and it is known that integrins bind extracellular matrix and can mediate cell migration, replication or apoptosis  <cit> . vcam <dig> expression has not previously been associated with granulosa cells in follicle development. it is generally expressed in endothelial cells but can be expressed in other epithelia and promote adhesion of circulating inflammatory cells  <cit> , and thus may also participate in the ovulatory process.

proteolysis and inhibition
there are  <dig> up-regulated transcripts that encode enzymes which collectively encompass a broad range of proteolytic activities  in large follicles. two highly-expressed transcripts are encoded by the serine protease  <dig>  and tissue plasminogen activator  genes. this group includes several members of the adam family of metalloproteases: adam <dig>  adam <dig>  adam <dig> and adamts <dig>  three well known protease inhibitor genes, timp <dig>  timp <dig> and serpina <dig>  are also abundantly expressed. although it is known that adamts <dig> plays a role in matrix remodelling and is important for ovulation in the mouse  <cit> , horse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  and adam <dig> is regulated by progesterone and luteinising hormone  <cit> , there is little evidence to date concerning the function of adam metalloproteases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the ovarian follicle. these three proteases together are capable of degrading fibronectin and collagen iv, and shed fas and kit ligand from epithelial cells in vitro <cit>  and thus may regulate the breakdown of matrix and differentiation of granulosa cells prior to ovulation. the inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases, timp  <dig> and  <dig> are also critical players in the breakdown of matrix close to the time of ovulation  <cit>  and can promote progesterone synthesis. an important feature of future studies will be to comprehensively map the spatio-temporal expression of these proteins in the extracellular matrix, and determine the biological effect of their accumulation.

genes activated in small versus large follicles
table  <dig> shows several important cytokine and receptor genes which have lower expression in large follicles including kit, pdgfc , fgfr <dig>  f2rl <dig>  il <dig>  il20ra, and angpt <dig>  other interesting highly down regulated genes of various functions include the developmental genes: mest , ihh  and myc, and also jakmip <dig>  which participates in cell polarisation.

two of the genes mentioned before, kit <cit>  and amh <cit> , are associated with follicle survival and maturation. the imprinted gene mest which is mesodermally expressed in early embryos  <cit> , is also strongly up regulated in small follicles. this developmental gene has been shown to be highly expressed in oocytes compared with cumulus cells  <cit> , but not necessarily throughout the membrana granulosa. ihh, one of the hedgehog-signalling family genes found here to be up regulated in small follicles, has been shown to be necessary for proper egg chamber formation in drosophila  <cit> , and is hormonally regulated and associated with co-maturation of the theca interna in the mammalian ovary  <cit> . both ihh and mest may be necessary for the maintenance of an immature granulosa cell phenotype in small follicles. interestingly, a related hedgehog family member sonic hedgehog homolog  has also been reported to be regulated by heparan sulphate proteoglycan binding  <cit> . these molecules exist in abundance within antral follicles in the form of syndecan and glypican   <cit>  and perlecan   <cit> , and it is possible that they may play a role at this stage of follicle development.

upstream regulator analyses
ipa upstream regulator analysis was used to identify upstream transcriptional regulators and the results are shown in table  <dig>  the validity and usefulness of such analyses is shown by the identification of known important pathways or molecules affecting follicle growth or granulosa cell function such as the gonadotrophin/protein kinase pathways , renin angiotensin system , oestradiol , leptin , inhibin , gata transcription factors , , vegf, retinoid action , lipid metabolism  and the aryl hydrocarbon  receptor .

*the bias-corrected z-score is used to infer the activation states of transcriptional regulators. it is calculated from the proportions of genes which are differentially regulated in an expected direction based on the known interactions between the regulator and the genes present in the ingenuity database. those genes with a z-score greater or less than two are considered to be either activated or inhibited respectively.

**the p value of overlap is the calculated statistical significance of overlap between genes from the dataset and genes that are known to be regulated by the upstream regulator using fisher’s exact test.

two molecules which have not been well studied in relation to follicular development appear to significantly alter transcription in large follicles: xbp <dig> and stat <dig> . xbp <dig> is cleaved to an activated form under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress and subsequently stimulates the expression of a number of chaperones resulting in removal of misfolded proteins and targets them for degradation  <cit> . it is predicted to be up regulated, and it is possible that radical oxygen species generated by the steroidogenic process may contribute to the misfolding of proteins  <cit> . stat <dig> is also predicted to be up regulated in large follicles, and is a mediator of the interleukin − <dig> immune response  <cit> , and further supports the involvement of inflammatory processes detected within the follicle at this time as indicated by the ipa and go enrichment analyses.

a new pathway or molecule identified by ipa upstream regulator analyses is mgea <dig>  which was down regulated in large follicles . there is a diverse set of about  <dig> proteins known to be post-translationally modified by the addition of o-linked n-acetylglucosamine  to their serine and threonine residues by the action of the enzyme o-glcnac transferase   <cit> . mgea <dig> encodes beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase , whose catalytic activity removes o-glcnac from serine and threonine residues in proteins  <cit> . this cycling of o-glcnac to post-translationally modify proteins can therefore regulate the activity of these proteins. o-linked glycosylation has been observed in bovine cumulus cells and linked to the availability of nutrients for the fuel-sensing hexosamine biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is sensitive to the levels of lipid, glucose and amine which together supply components of o-glcnac. flux in nutrients thereby modulates protein activity by flux in o-linked glycosylation of proteins. down regulation of mgea <dig> in large follicles suggests that in small follicles there is decreased o-linked glycosylation of proteins and indeed increased o-linked glycosylation of proteins has been observed to be negative for the success of oocyte maturation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, substantial changes occur in gene expression in granulosa cells as follicles enlarge from small to large antral sizes. gene expression becomes less variable, and the processes of axonal guidance, immune signalling and cell rearrangement were most affected in large follicles. some important networks were associated with:  notch, slit/robo and pi3k signalling, and  itgb <dig> and extracellular matrix signalling through extracellular signal related kinases . upstream regulator genes which were predicted to be active in large follicles include stat <dig> and xbp <dig>  whereas mgea <dig> was predicted to be inhibited. the latter encodes an enzyme that modifies the activity of many target proteins, including those involved in energy sensing, by removal of n-acetylglucosamine from serine and threonine residues. by comparison, developmental processes such as those stimulated by kit, ihh and mest were most active in small follicles.
