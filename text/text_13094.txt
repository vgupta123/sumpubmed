BACKGROUND
metazoan receptor tyrosine kinases  respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli, initiating signals that regulate important cellular and developmental processes  <cit> . the phosphotyrosine-based signaling system  evolved relatively recently  <cit> ; ptyr signaling was originally thought to be unique to metazoans. remarkably, recent genomic analyses have demonstrated that several unicellular organisms possess numbers of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are comparable to higher metazoans. choanoflagellates are free-living aquatic protists that represent the closest unicellular relatives to metazoans  <cit> . tyrosine kinases are abundant in the choanoflagellates monosiga brevicollis, monosiga ovata, and salpingoeca rosetta <cit> . tyrosine kinases are also found in even more ancient opisthokonts, including the filasterean capsaspora owczarzaki <cit> . although the physiological functions of these unicellular tyrosine kinases are not yet known, they are presumably involved in the responses to extracellular signals such as the presence of nutrients, ions, or chemical messengers.

the genome of monosiga brevicollis is estimated to encode as many as  <dig> tyrosine kinases and approximately  <dig> total protein kinases  <cit> . . most of the monosiga brevicollis tyrosine kinases have no identifiable metazoan homologs . as in metazoans, monosiga brevicollis tyrosine kinases never appear as isolated catalytic domains; instead, each tyrosine kinase possesses a repertoire of associated signaling domains. many of the domain combinations are distinct from any observed in metazoans. there are predicted to be  <dig> rtks in m. brevicollis;  <dig> of the rtks cluster into  <dig> families   <cit> . while these rtks possess many of the same features as metazoan rtks , their overall sequences show limited homology to the families of metazoan rtks. it is not yet known whether the m. brevicollis rtks  are enzymatically active as tyrosine kinases.

the rtkb family of tyrosine kinases from m. brevicollis consists of nine members. while the sequences of the rtkb kinase catalytic domains are related, the extracellular regions are quite diverse  <cit> . three of the nine rtkb kinases appear to lack important catalytic residues and may function as pseudokinases or scaffolding proteins. of the six remaining rtkb kinases, four possess a unique modular domain  in their cytoplasmic tails . the rm <dig> domains contain potential src-family kinase phosphorylation sites and sh2-binding sites, suggesting that they may link rtk activation with downstream cytoplasmic signals  <cit> . in this paper, we characterized monosiga brevicollis rtkb <dig>  a kinase with six rm <dig> domains in its c-tail. we cloned, expressed, and purified the rtkb <dig> kinase, and conducted biochemical studies of its activity. these studies are the first of an rtk from a unicellular organism.

RESULTS
monosiga brevicollis rtkb <dig> is predicted to be a type i transmembrane protein, with a single membrane-spanning region  <cit>  . the extracellular domain organization of rtkb <dig> has several features in common with families of metazoan rtks, although the exact combination of domains has not been observed in any metazoan family. rtkb <dig> contains a cys-rich domain similar to those seen in the tnf receptor and to the furin-like domains of egfr and insulin receptor  <cit> . two divergent repeats similar to hyalin are present; these modules are structurally related to the immunoglobulin-like fold seen in many metazoan rtks  <cit> . rtkb <dig> contains a short consensus repeat /complement control protein domain, as seen in a variety of complement and adhesion proteins. towards the c-terminus of the extracellular domain, rtkb <dig> contains five egf-like modules, as seen in  the tie and eph families of metazoan rtks. as is true for all monosiga brevicollis rtks, the extracellular ligand is unknown.

the predicted intracellular portion of rtkb <dig> contains a single tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. the kinase domain of rtkb <dig> has limited homology to known families of metazoan rtks, but possesses the catalytically important residues found in all tyrosine kinases . rtkb <dig> has a single tyrosine residue in the predicted activation loop, c-terminal to the kinase-conserved dfg motif . the c-terminus of rtkb <dig> contains six copies of a unique domain designated rm <dig>  rm <dig> domains are composed of approximately  <dig> amino acid residues. they are found in the cytoplasmic tails of four of the nine monosiga brevicollis rtkb tyrosine kinases, but they are not present in any other sequence in the protein database, whether from monosiga, metazoans, or any other organism  <cit> . rm <dig> domains contain tyrosine residues that are predicted to serve as phosphorylation sites as well as sh2-binding sites .

to test whether the predicted rtkb <dig> protein is an active tyrosine kinase, we used pcr with kinase-specific primers to amplify the cdna encoding the catalytic domain  from a monosiga brevicollis cdna library. we cloned the rtkb <dig> kinase sequence into a baculovirus expression vector, infected spodoptera frugiperda  insect cells with the recombinant baculovirus, and purified the protein . using the phosphocellulose paper binding assay, we tested rtkb <dig> kinase activity towards several synthetic peptides . rtkb <dig> was highly active, with a specific activity similar to other purified rtk kinase domains . the highest activity was observed with a peptide  containing the eeeeymmmm motif that was selected from a synthetic peptide library as a highly efficient insulin receptor substrate  <cit> . this activity  is comparable to the activity of monosiga brevicollis mbsrc <dig> toward its preferred substrates . we also tested two peptides with sequences corresponding to predicted phosphorylation sites within rtkb <dig> rm <dig> domains. rtkb2- <dig> is derived from the fifth rm <dig> domain, while rtkb2- <dig> is derived from the sixth rm <dig>  both peptides were phosphorylated by rtkb <dig> kinase, consistent with the possibility that these sites on the rtkb <dig> c-tail serve as autophosphorylation sites. we previously showed that these peptides are also phosphorylated by the monosiga src-like kinase mbsrc <dig>  <cit> .

many rtks are regulated by autophosphorylation at one or more tyrosines within the activation loop, a flexible segment between the two lobes of the kinase catalytic domain  <cit> . rtkb <dig> has a single tyrosine in the predicted activation loop . to test for rtkb <dig> autophosphorylation, we first treated the purified enzyme with yersinia tyrosine-specific yop phosphatase. next, we incubated the dephosphorylated rtkb <dig> with magnesium and -atp and followed the reaction by sds-page and autoradiography . labeled phosphate was incorporated into rtkb <dig> after 5– <dig> minutes under these conditions. the stoichiometry of phosphorylation after  <dig> minutes was  <dig>  mol phosphate/mol protein. in a parallel experiment, the time-course of autophosphorylation was followed by western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody . in this experiment, the signal for pre-yop treated rtkb <dig> was stronger than the signal for autophosphorylated rtkb <dig>  raising the possibility that multiple sites are phosphorylated in sf <dig> cells. to determine whether autophosphorylation influences rtkb <dig> kinase activity, we carried out a peptide phosphorylation assay with purified rtkb <dig>  yop-dephosphorylated rtkb <dig>  and enzyme that had been allowed to re-phosphorylate as described above. dephosphorylated rtkb <dig> lost significant kinase activity as compared to the starting sample, but the activity was regained upon re-phosphorylation . these results are consistent with a role for rtkb <dig> autophosphorylation in the control of enzymatic function.

the six rm <dig> domains in the c-tail of rtkb <dig> contain tyrosines near their n-termini that are predicted to serve as phosphorylation and sh2-binding sites   <cit> . as shown above in figure  <dig>  synthetic peptides derived from two of the domains are indeed substrates for rtkb <dig> kinase. to study an intact rm <dig> domain, we synthesized the gene corresponding to the sixth rm <dig> domain . the sixth rm <dig> domain was chosen because it contains a predicted src phosphorylation/sh2-binding site that conforms well to the consensus , and because the rtkb2- <dig> peptide  corresponds to this site. we cloned the cdna into a bacterial expression vector, expressed the protein in e. coli cells, and purified it by metal affinity chromatography . despite a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  daltons, purified rm2- <dig> migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately  <dig>  daltons on sds-page . the aberrant mobility of rm2- <dig> may be due to the highly acidic amino acid composition . we confirmed the molecular weight of the bacterially-expressed rm <dig> domain by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry .

to determine whether the isolated rm <dig> domain could serve as a substrate for rtkb <dig> kinase, we incubated the two purified proteins with mg-atp and followed the reaction by anti-ptyr western blotting . tyrosine-phosphorylated rm2- <dig> was detected after 5– <dig> minutes in this reaction, consistent with the role of rm <dig> domains as autophosphorylation sites. the purified rm <dig> domain could also be phosphorylated by m. brevicollis mbsrc <dig> kinase . we determined the stoichiometry of rm2- <dig> phosphorylation by mbsrc <dig> in a parallel reaction with -atp. after  <dig> minutes, the stoichiometry was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  moles of phosphate per mole of rm2- <dig> domain. rm2- <dig> has three potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites; these results raise the possibility of multisite phosphorylation in the six rm <dig> domains in the c-terminus of rtkb <dig>  the tyr-glu-ala-ile sequence within rm2- <dig> fits the consensus sequence for binding to the sh <dig> domains of src-family kinases  <cit> . the mbsrc <dig> sh <dig> domain has a similar binding preference as its metazoan counterparts  <cit> . to test for mbsrc <dig> sh <dig> binding, we first phosphorylated rm2- <dig> using rtkb <dig> and -atp. next, we incubated the py-rm <dig> with an immobilized protein consisting of glutathione s-transferase  fused to the sh <dig> domain of mbsrc <dig> . the phosphorylated rm <dig> domain bound to the mbsrc <dig> sh <dig> domain, as detected by autoradiography. when the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of a high-affinity sh <dig> binding peptide , binding between rm- <dig> and the mbsrc <dig> sh <dig> domains was drastically reduced . these results are consistent with a model in which rtkb <dig> autophosphorylation initiates the formation of a signaling complex, potentially containing mbsrc <dig>  and additional sh2-containing monosiga proteins.

to study rm <dig> domain phosphorylation in a cellular context, we amplified a cdna encoding the c-terminal tail of the rtk , and cloned it into a mammalian expression vector to produce a fusion with green fluorescent protein . we expressed the protein in src/yes/fyn triple knockout fibroblast cells , which lack all src family kinases  <cit> . fluorescence microscopy showed that the gfp-rtkb2-ct has a diffuse cytoplasmic localization . next, we expressed gfp-rtkb2-ct in syf cells alone or in the presence of flag-tagged mbsrc <dig> kinase . we isolated rtkb <dig> by anti-gfp immunoprecipitation and analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation by western blotting. rtkb2-ct was weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated in these experiments, and the addition of mbsrc <dig> gave only a modest increase in phosphorylation . we were unable to detect a complex between rtkb2-ct and mbsrc <dig> by co-immunoprecipitation . while these experiments confirm the ability of the rtkb <dig> c-tail to be phosphorylated, it is likely that ligand-stimulated rtkb <dig> kinase would produce much higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation. furthermore, the lack of membrane-anchoring motifs in the rtkb2-ct and mbsrc <dig> constructs likely reduces the efficiency of their interaction.

the unique sequences of the rm <dig> domains suggest that they may serve as novel signaling modules. many eukaryotic signaling domains adopt defined structures, even when removed from their parental proteins  <cit> . in order to evaluate the solution structure of 15n labeled rm <dig>  a 1h-15n hsqc spectrum was acquired . the spectrum of rm <dig> illustrates that the chemical shift of the backbone amide resonances display narrow dispersion, cluster and overlap around the center of the spectrum, while the line shapes are sharp. these features are typical of a disordered protein. furthermore, the number of backbone amide resonances is lower than the expected count of  <dig>  for his <dig> tagged rm <dig>  presumably because the resonances are extensively overlapped due to the disordered state of the rm <dig> domain. we attempted to model the structure of the rm2- <dig> domain using the web-based protein homology/analogy recognition engine  . phyre predicted that 52% of the rm2- <dig> domain is disordered, and secondary structural elements were predicted with low confidence. collectively, our data suggest that the rm <dig> domains of rtkb <dig> serve as kinase/sh <dig> binding sites, and that ptyr-sh <dig> binding is the main determinant for interaction, rather than a well-defined protein-protein interface.

discussion
the abundance and diversity of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in the unicellular choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis rival that of any metazoan  <cit> . the  <dig> rtks found in the genome of m. brevicollis possess a wide variety of domain organizations. the divergent architectures of the choanoflagellate rtks were likely generated by gene duplication and domain shuffling  <cit> . the m. brevicollis rtks have no direct homologs in multicellular organisms. in contrast, sponges, which are regarded as the oldest surviving metazoan lineage, possess most of the rtk families found in higher metazoans  <cit> . the genome of the sponge amphimedon queenslandica contains  <dig> rtk genes, including kinase domains from six known animal families: epidermal growth factor receptor , met, discoidin domain receptor , ror, eph, and sevenless  <cit> . the sponge oscarella carmela possesses a similar array of homologs, and rtks with homology to the receptors for insulin-like growth factor i and fibroblast growth factor  <cit> . this is consistent with a model in which the common ancestor between choanoflagellates and metazoans had rtks, but the animal cell-specific families of rtks developed after the split between the two groups  <cit> .

rtkb <dig>  the tyrosine kinase studied here, is one of the nine rtkb-family kinases from m. brevicollis. as the most primitive rtk to be yet studied, these results shed light on the evolution of biochemical function in the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. rtkb <dig> is active as a tyrosine kinase, and the intrinsic enzymatic function of the rtkb <dig> catalytic domain is high towards synthetic peptides, particularly the ir/igf1r family peptide substrate e4ym <dig> . rtkb <dig> also catalyzes autophosphorylation, an event that increases the activity of the enzyme . rtkb <dig> possesses a single tyrosine residue within the predicted activation loop . activation loops are one of the distinguishing features of eukaryotic protein kinases  <cit> . they are flexible, dynamic segments that are often stabilized in the active conformation by addition of one or more phosphates . the control of rtkb <dig> activity by autophosphorylation indicates that this mode of regulation was present in primitive rtks before the evolution of multicellular animals over  <dig> million years ago.

the c-terminal tail of rtkb <dig> contains  <dig> copies of the rm <dig> domain, a unique region of ≈  <dig> residues that has not been found outside of the rtkb family in m. brevicollis . rtkb <dig>  rtkb <dig>  and rtkb <dig> each have one copy of the rm <dig> domain c-terminal to their tyrosine kinase domains  <cit> . each of the rm <dig> domains has a tyrosine residue preceded by one or more negatively-charged amino acids. scansite prediction indicated that these could serve as src phosphorylation sites and/or sh2-binding sites  <cit> . our data show that an isolated rm <dig> domain is phosphorylated by the rtkb <dig> kinase or by mbsrc <dig>  a src-family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase from m. brevicollis . small synthetic peptides derived from the potential phosphorylation sites from two of the rtkb <dig> rm <dig> domains are also substrates . the tyrosine phosphorylated rm <dig> domain binds specifically to the sh <dig> domain of mbsrc <dig> , suggesting that phosphorylation of one or more rm <dig> domains can recruit cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and other cellular proteins to propagate the rtkb <dig> signal. in contrast to other modular signaling domains , the isolated rm <dig> domain appears to lack an ordered structure when it is removed from the context of the surrounding protein . these binding sites at the c-terminus of rtkb <dig> may serve a similar recruitment function as the tyrosine motifs found in the short, unstructured cytoplasmic tails of the thrombopoietin or erythropoietin receptors  <cit>  or the phosphorylation sites in the c-termini of rtks such as the epidermal growth factor receptor.

binding of the m. brevicollis mbsrc <dig> kinase to the phosphorylated rm <dig> domain raises the possibility that receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase signaling are linked, as in metazoans. a classic example of the linkage in mammalian cells is observed in the role for src in relaying the signal through the platelet-derived growth factor  family of receptors. src stably associates with the cytoplasmic portion of the pdgf receptor, leading to enhanced src activity  <cit> . for pdgfra, src is required for the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein shc  <cit> . after binding to pdgfrb, src phosphorylates a tyrosine residue on the receptor; this inhibits a signaling pathway leading to motility, but increases mitogenic signaling  <cit> . mbsrc <dig> phosphorylates the c-tail of rtkb <dig> weakly in the absence of an activating signal . our results are consistent with a model in which rtkb <dig> activation  stimulates receptor autophosphorylation within the rm <dig> domains. this leads to mbsrc <dig> recruitment and further phosphorylation, which may serve to increase or dampen specific downstream signals. identifying the nature of these signals will require the development of methodology to manipulate gene function in choanoflagellates.

CONCLUSIONS
we conducted the first biochemical study of a unicellular receptor tyrosine kinase. we cloned, expressed, and purified the rtkb <dig> kinase, and showed that it is enzymatically active. the activity of rtkb <dig> is regulated by autophosphorylation. the receptor possesses six copies of a unique domain  in its c-terminal tail. an isolated rm <dig> domain was a substrate for rtkb <dig> kinase, and the phosphorylated rm <dig> domain bound to the sh <dig> domain of a src family kinase. thus, this unicellular signaling system contains many of the features found in metazoan rtk pathways.
