BACKGROUND
bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antibacterial peptides produced by bacteria that possess inhibitory activity against closely related species. two major types of bacteriocins can be distinguished according to their posttranslational modifications: class i, the modified bacteriocins or lantibiotics, and class ii, the unmodified bacteriocins. lantibiotics are a group of small  modified bacteriocins characterized by the presence of unusual amino acids such as the thioether-bridge-containing amino acids lanthionine  and methyl-lanthionine , and several dehydrated amino acids such as α,β-didehydroalanine  and α,β-didehydrobutyrine . most lantibiotics show broad antibacterial activity. for instance, nisin, a safe food preservative  <cit> , displays potent activity against gram-positive bacteria, including spoilage and pathogenic bacteria such as bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus, staphylococcus, and streptococcus  <cit> . however, some peptides  such as sapb  <cit>  show no antibacterial activity.

lantibiotics are synthesized as prepeptides that consist of an n-terminal leader sequence and a propeptide part; these prepeptides subsequently undergo posttranslational modifications to become the mature antibiotic. the formation of lan and melan are attributed to the intermolecular cyclization of the thiol groups of cysteine residues with dha and dhb, which are obtained from the dehydration of serine and threonine residues, respectively. dedicated biosynthetic enzymes are required during the process of maturation and the genes encoding these proteins are clustered, as described for nisin  <cit> , pep <dig>  <cit> , nukacin isk- <dig>  <cit> , epicidin  <dig>  <cit> , and mersacidin  <cit> . according to the genetic organization of lantibiotics, they can be divided into several types  <cit> . the typical gene cluster of type ai lantibiotics, such as nisin and epidermin, includes the structural gene lana, modification enzyme-encoding genes lanb and lanc, the processing protease-encoding gene lanp, the transporter gene lant, and the immunity genes lani and/or lanefg. however, not all type ai lantibiotic-like gene clusters contain all these genes; for example, in the gene cluster spabtcaifgrk  <cit> , which codes for the biosynthesis of subtilin, the function of lanp is replaced by an intrinsic protease of bacillus subtilis atcc  <dig>  <cit> .

much attention has been concentrated on the identification of new lantibiotics because of their potent antimicrobial activities. in recent years, with the availability of abundant genomic sequence data in public databases, many new lantibiotics and lantipeptides such as bsa, lichenicidin, and a range of cyanobacteria-associated lantipeptides  <cit>  have been identified. for example, the bacterial genus paenibacillus is known for its ability to produce peptide antibiotics  <cit> , and an increasing number of paenibacillus spp. genomes have been sequenced, revealing several novel lantibiotic-related gene clusters  <cit> . however, to date, only one novel lantibiotic, paenibacillin, produced by paenibacillus polymyxa osy-df  <cit>  has been reported. in the present study, we present the detailed bioinformatic analysis of a novel lantibiotic-like gene cluster in the paenibacillus elgii b <dig> genome. screening of bacterial cultures, mass spectrometry  analysis, and n-terminal amino acid sequencing were used to confirm that the p. elgii b <dig> gene cluster encodes elgicins, novel broad-spectrum lantibiotics.

RESULTS
putative lantibiotic-like gene cluster of p. elgii b69
p. elgii b <dig> was subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing, yielding  <dig>  mb of sequence on  <dig> assembled contigs  <cit> . data mining for the lanc homolog amidst the genomic data of p. elgii b <dig>  using the spac sequence of p. polymyxa e <dig> as a driver, resulted in the identification of a lantibiotic-like gene cluster containing five probable open reading frames , designated elgt <dig>  elgc, elgt <dig>  elgb, and elga . all genes, except elgt <dig>  were transcribed in the same orientation. the amino acid sequences of the four products of the elg gene  showed high levels of identity  with those of homologous proteins from several type ai lantibiotic gene clusters .

elgt <dig> ) and elgt <dig>  showed high-level identity with numerous adenosine-5'-triphosphate -binding cassette  transporter proteins. elgt <dig> shared 31% identity with spat, a protein responsible for the transportation of the ericins a and s of b. subtilis a1/ <dig>   <cit> , and 31% identity with etnt, which is responsible for the export of the entianin of b. subtilis subsp. spizizenii dsm 15029t   <cit> . similarly, elgt <dig> showed strong homology  with the subtilin-transport protein of b. subtilis atcc  <dig>   <cit> , and was homologous to nist of lactococcus lactis n <dig>  and nsut of streptococcus uberis  <dig>  . these proteins are responsible for the transportation of nisin z and nisin u, respectively  <cit> . the two proteins elgt <dig> and elgt <dig> also shared 28% sequence identity with each other, suggesting that they have similar functions in the processes of transportation and secretion of elgicins. elgt <dig> and elgt <dig> may serve as a two-component abc transporter, similar to mibtu and cintu, which are probably involved in the export of microbisporicin and cinnamycin  <cit> ; however this function is uncommon in the maturation of lantibiotics.

elgc encodes a protein containing  <dig> amino acids, which shows strong homology to the lantibiotic cyclase, mibc, of microbispora corallina nrrl  <dig>  . mibc is involved in the formation of lan bridges in microbisporicin  <cit> . the amino acid sequences encoded by the lanc genes have some conserved structural motifs, including gxahg, wcxg, and chg, in which the cysteine and histidine residues are highly conserved  <cit> . the alignment of elgc with several type ai lantibiotic synthetases showed that elgc contains several conserved sequences, such as gvshg , wcyg , and chg , wherein his <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig>  and his <dig> are strictly conserved. these observations indicate that elgc is a lantibiotic synthetase that catalyzes the synthesis of lan and melan residues.

a large orf upstream and overlapping elgt <dig> by  <dig> bp encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the putative protein elgb shares 31% identity with mibb of m. corallina nrrl  <dig>  and 30% identity with spab of b. subtilis atcc  <dig> . the proteins mibb and spab are responsible for the dehydration of serine and threonine residues in the propeptide to form the unsaturated amino acids of microbisporicin and subtilin, respectively  <cit> . thus, elgb appears to be a dehydratase involved in the process of maturation.

similarly, elga encodes the prepeptide of the elgicins, with a length of  <dig> amino acids. no lantibiotics reported thus far share homology with elga, suggesting that the mature proteins derived from elga are novel lantibiotics. the alignment of the putative leader peptide of elga with those of other lantibiotics revealed the existence of a possibly conserved motif "fdld" , which resembles the "fdln" motif in the leader peptide of type ai lantibiotics  <cit> . considering that the elg gene cluster contains the lanb and lanc genes encoding the modified enzymes, it could be concluded that the elgicins are type ai lantibiotics.

the elg gene cluster lacks the immunity genes lani and lanefg. lanefg acts as an abc transporter for lantibiotic immunity; for example, nisefg expels lantibiotic molecules that have entered the cytoplasmic membrane into the extracellular environment  <cit> . considering the mechanism of lanefg-imparted immunity, elgt1t <dig> is likely to play a role in self-protection, in addition to that of secretion and transportation of the elgicins.

the leader peptides of type ai lantibiotics are usually processed by a serine protease encoded by lanp, which is not found in the elg gene cluster. the leader peptide of elga may instead be processed by an intrinsic b <dig> serine protease. this elgicin maturation process might therefore resemble that of subtilin, wherein the leader peptide of presubtilin is removed by an intrinsic b. subtilis subtilisin-like protease  <cit> .

isolation and purification of elgicins
genomic analysis of p. elgii b <dig> revealed the presence of a new lantibiotic-like gene cluster. to express this elg gene cluster, p. elgii b <dig> was grown aerobically at 30°c for  <dig> h in different fermentation media designed for the production of active substances. at harvest, extractions of b <dig> fermentation broths were achieved using column chromatographic fractionation on ab- <dig> macroporous resin . the kl medium fraction 2so <dig>   <dig>  g/l k2hpo <dig>   <dig> g/l mgso <dig>   <dig> g/l nacl,  <dig> g/l cacl <dig>   <dig> mg/l feso4·7h2o,  <dig> mg/l znso4·7h2o, and  <dig>  mg/l mnso4·h2o, ph  <dig> ) eluted by 80% methanol showed activity against the indicator strain p. ehimensis. this fraction was then applied to the solid-phase extraction  column. the fraction with activity against the indicator strain was eluted with 50% methanol and further separated by analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography . aided by the presence of several tyrosine residues within the precursor peptide elga, its ultraviolet  absorption was measured at  <dig> nm during analytical hplc. the fractions corresponding to the retention time of  <dig> - <dig>  min were isolated, and they showed activity against p. ehimensis.

large-scale fermentation of p. elgii b <dig> was carried out in kl medium for the production of active substances. the target compounds were then isolated by a simple three-step purification procedure consisting of ab- <dig> resin fractionation, spe, and preparative rp-hplc, as described in the "methods" section. in the preparative rp-hplc profile, the three peaks corresponding to retention times of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  min  were pooled and designated elgicin a, b, and c, respectively, of which elgicin b was the major component. these fractions were lyophilized and subjected to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry  for molecular analyses.

esi-ms analyses of elgicins
to determine the molecular masses of elgicins, the lyophilized elgicins a, b, and c were dissolved in sterile water and subjected to esi-ms. the ms spectrum of hplc-purified elgicin a revealed four signals at the mass-to-charge ratios   <dig>  4+,  <dig>  3+,  <dig>  4+, and  <dig>  3+ . the molecular weight calculated from the two former signals was  <dig> da, and the others corresponded to a molecular weight of  <dig> da. these findings suggest that peak  <dig> contained two compounds, designated elgicin ai and elgicin aii. the molecular weight of elgicin aii was  <dig> da larger than that of elgicin ai; this difference corresponds to the molecular weight of a single glycine residue. in the case of peak  <dig>  the mass spectrum showed the presence of two strong signals at m/z values of  <dig>  4+ and  <dig>  3+, corresponding to a molecular mass of  <dig> da . the molecular weight of elgicin b was  <dig> da larger than that of aii; this difference corresponds to the molecular mass of a single leucine residue, as deduced from the prepeptide of elga that lacks an isoleucine residue . compound elgicin c, with a retention time of  <dig>  min, had a molecular mass of  <dig> da, consistent with the two signals at m/z  <dig>  4+ and  <dig>  3+ . the molecular mass of elgicin c was  <dig> da larger than that of elgicin b; this difference is consistent with the molecular mass of a single asparagine residue.

lantibiotics have small molecular weights  that usually range from 1700- <dig> da. thus far, the molecular weights of only two lantibiotics, cytolysin ll  and carnocin u <dig> , exceed  <dig> kda   <cit> . our newly isolated four-component elgicins therefore have unusually large molecular weights of  <dig> da ,  <dig> da ,  <dig> da , and  <dig> da . to the best of our knowledge, no other lantibiotics have molecular weights greater than those of elgicins b and c.

analysis of n-terminal amino acid sequence
to confirm whether the four-component antibacterial agents are derived from elga, hplc-purified elgicin b was subjected to automated edman degradation to determine its n-terminal amino acid sequence . the first four amino acids were leu-gly-asp-tyr. the fifth residue was blocked completely, suggesting the presence of a dehydrated amino acid residue, a characteristic feature of lantibiotics. the leu-gly-asp-tyr sequence was consistent with the sequence of the propeptide that resulted from the removal of the leader peptide after cleavage at positions ranging between asp <dig> and leu <dig> of elga . the observed molecular weight of elgicin b was  <dig> da smaller than the calculated molecular weight of the unmodified propeptide, which can be explained by the loss of eight h2o molecules during posttranslational modification. therefore, elgicin b is deduced to be the posttranslational modified product of elga.

the residue at position  <dig> of elga  was asparagine and leucine was found at position  <dig>  considering the esi-ms results, wherein the molecular weight of elgicin c was  <dig> da larger and that of elgicin aii  <dig> da smaller than that of elgicin b, the n-terminal amino acid sequences of the unmodified propeptides of elgicins c and aii could be asp-leu-gly-asp-tyr and gly-asp-tyr, respectively. similarly, because the glycine residue was at position  <dig> of elga and the molecular weight of elgicin ai was  <dig> da smaller than that of elgicin aii, the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the unmodified propeptide of elgicin ai could be asp-tyr. the observed molecular weights of these three peptides were  <dig> da smaller than the calculated molecular weights of the respective predicted propeptides. this finding may be attributed to the loss of eight h2o molecules during maturation. elgicins ai, aii, and c were thus confirmed to be the modified products of elga, that is, these four antibacterial agents possibly originated from the same prepeptide, elga, by peptide cleavage, followed by the removal of one amino acid at each n-terminal.

in the elg gene cluster, the presence of elgb, elgc, and the leader peptide of elga containing the motif "fdld" confirmed that the elgicins are type ai lantibiotics. the origin of elgicins from identical pre-peptides by peptide cleavage and the removal of one amino acid from each corresponding n-terminus could be achieved in two ways. first, the serine protease could cleave at four cleavage sites of elga, that is, ala20-asp <dig>  asp21-leu <dig>  leu22-gly <dig>  and gly23-asp <dig> , resulting in the simultaneous production of these four peptides. second, the ala20-asp <dig> could be cleaved by the serine protease to produce elgicin c, followed by the successive protease removal of asp <dig>  leu <dig>  or gly <dig> residues from elgicin c to yield elgicins b, aii, and ai, respectively.

antimicrobial activity of elgicins
preparative rp-hplc-purified elgicin compounds  were pipetted onto a sterile paper disk and tested for antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains. as shown in table  <dig>  the active substances produced by p. elgii b <dig> showed inhibitory activity toward staphylococcus epidermidis cmcc  <dig>  staphylococcus aureus atcc  <dig>  pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc  <dig>  escherichia coli atcc  <dig>  and proteus vulgaris cmcc  <dig>  other tested strains, namely, s. aureus atcc  <dig> and b. subtilis cgmcc  <dig> , were resistant to elgicins.

athe amount of elgicins is  <dig> μg per disk.

bthe amount of polymyxin b is  <dig> μg per disk.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic sequence analysis of paenibacillus elgii b <dig> showed a novel lantibiotic-like gene cluster. four new lantibiotics, designated elgicins ai, aii, b, and c, were isolated from the kl medium. to the best of our knowledge, elgicins b and c are the largest reported lantibiotics to date, with molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig> da, respectively. elgicins have broad inhibitory activities against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. further studies are required to determine their structures, identify their mechanisms of action, and find suitable bioprocessing strategies for efficient elgicin production.
