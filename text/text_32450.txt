BACKGROUND
catalogues of expressed sequence tags  are developed from cdna libraries to obtain expressional sequence information in contrasting environmental conditions or across developmental stages. when available, they also offer an inexpensive source of gene-based dna markers, in particular ssrs  <cit> . such collections of ests were produced in several plants providing a unique opportunity for searching ssr motifs and further develop the corresponding microsatellite markers  <cit> . alternative and promising strategies to develop ssr markers from genome shotgun sequencing have recently emerged with the development of new generation sequencing technologies  <cit> . however, because ests correspond to coding dna, the flanking sequences of est-ssrs are located in well-conserved regions across phylogenetically related species, making them markers of choice for comparative mapping and relevant functional and positional candidate genes to study their co-location with quantitative trait loci .

the construction of a high resolution genetic map populated with ssrs requires considerable efforts, including the development of several hundreds of markers  and the genotyping of a large number of plants to ensure that most of the markers are correctly ordered, i.e. with a high lod support for local ordering. alternatively, bin-mapping or selective mapping  <cit>  offers a less accurate but faster and cost-effective approach to locate many markers on an already existing framework map. this mapping strategy consists of genotyping a subset of highly informative offspring  that are selected based on the number and position of crossover sites. in brief, the optimal bin set of a given size presents the maximum number of breaking points evenly spaced throughout the map, ideally resulting in a number of bins that is close to the number of framework marker intervals. this approach has been used successfully in peach  <cit> , melon  <cit> , strawberry  <cit>  and apple  <cit> . here, we use this approach for the first time in a forest tree species: oak.

oaks represent a major component of the northern hemisphere forest. in particular, pedunculate  oak is widely spread throughout europe, from spain to russia . this species is associated with important environmental  and economic  services. it has been used for years to study the genetic architecture of forest tree adaptation through common garden experiments  <cit> , where natural populations growing in their native environments have been transplanted in a common environment, and qtl mapping studies  <cit> , as well as to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive traits such as bud phenology  <cit> , water-use efficiency  <cit>  and response to root hypoxia  <cit> .

different types of molecular markers were developed in q. robur for linkage mapping to study the genetic architecture of adaptive traits. the different versions of the map included hundreds of random amplified polymorphic dna  markers  <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphisms   <cit>  markers, and a set of  <dig> simple sequence repeats obtained from enriched genomic libraries   <cit> . because of their highly polymorphic nature and high degree of transferability across species, ssrs proved to be very useful markers to align different maps of q. robur as well as to initiate a comparative mapping analysis with castanea sativa , another important fagaceae species  <cit> . despite combining interesting features  too few ssrs have been yet made available in oak to advance to more detailed genetic studies. the high cost associated with their development from enriched genomic libraries  <cit>  and the lack of sequences for the genus quercus genus probably contributed to the delay of the construction of a large battery of ssrs.

in this context, the main objectives of this study were: i/ to screen the oak ests for ssr motifs , ii/ to develop a set of est-ssr markers and compile the data in a dedicated database, iii/ to compare their polymorphism information content with gssr, iv/ to test the transferability of these markers in chesnut and v/ to map as much ssr loci as possible on two parental framework linkage maps of q. robur using a bin-mapping approach. this study constitutes the first step toward the establishment of a consensus linkage map for oak based on ssrs segregating in several mapping populations.

RESULTS
ssr mining and est-ssrs frequency
ssrs were searched among the  <dig>  unigene elements obtained from the assembly of  <dig>  ests into  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons, using stackpackâ„¢. the search was performed for di- , tri- , tetra- , penta-  and hexa-  nucleotides, using the mreps software  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigene elements contained at least one ssrs, resulting into  <dig>  microsatellites, ie. a ssr frequency of  <dig> %, taking into account multiple occurrences of ssrs in some unigene elements. as expected, the most frequent type of microsatellites corresponded to trimeric ssrs . this was followed by dimeric  and hexameric  ssrs. the abundance of tetrameric and pentameric ssrs was lower, representing only 8% and 5% of the microsatellites, respectively. the size of the ssr string varied from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp  and the average number of repeats were  <dig>  for dimeric ,  <dig> for trimeric ,  <dig>  for tetrameric ,  <dig>  for pentameric , and  <dig>  for hexameric  ssrs. among the dimeric ssrs, ag was found as the most common motif , followed by at , ac  and cg . similarly, for trimeric ssrs, the most common motifs were aag , acc  and aac . for the three other classes, the most common ssr types corresponded to aaan , aaaan , and aaaaan . all these ssrs were made available in additional file  <dig> - table s <dig>  which compiles information such as number of repeats, size of the motif, annotation etc.

distribution of est-ssrs
for 86% of the  <dig>  ssrs, estscan  <cit>  succeeded in estimating whether ssrs were located in non-coding   vs. coding   regions of each est. the occurrence of each category in coding and non-coding regions is shown in figure 1a. overall,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the non-coding ssrs were located at 5'- and 3'-utr, respectively. using framedp, 83% of the  <dig>  ssrs was estimated in at least one predicted peptide . as estscan, framedp prediction showed that smaller numbers of ssrs were located in non-coding  compared to coding regions . overall,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the non-coding ssrs were located at the 5'- and 3'- utrs, respectively. the most remarkable result obtained by framedp was the increased ratio of ssrs predicted in coding regions , that can be attributed to a higher frequency among dinucleotide motifs compared to estscan.

marker development
of the  <dig>  ssrs motifs identified, we designed primer pairs for  <dig> ssrs , including  <dig> di-,  <dig> tri-,  <dig> tetra-,  <dig> penta-, and  <dig> hexa-nucleotide ssrs. locus id, forward and reverse primer sequences, type of motif and length, amplification and polymorphism in the tested full-sib pedigree have been reported in additional file  <dig> - table s <dig>  a total of  <dig> primer pairs  amplified a pcr product, among which  <dig>  were found to amplify a single polymorphic locus, i.e.  <dig> % of the total number of tested primers. it was also found that the level of polymorphism depended on the type of motif . these loci segregated in the testcross configuration, i.e. 1: <dig> ratio , or in the intercross configuration, i.e. 1:1:1: <dig> ratio  or 1:2: <dig> ratio . markers segregating 1:1:1: <dig> were recoded in the 1: <dig> ratio in the male and female parents.

transferability of est-ssrs
a subset of oak est-ssrs were also tested for their transferability in chestnut  another important fagaceae species. a total of  <dig> dinucleotide est-ssrs were tested for their amplification on two dna specimen , from which 63% amplified a single pcr product, a figure that is significantly higher than that obtained for the transferability of dinucleotide genomic ssrs from oak to chestnut, i.e. 47% in  <cit> . in addition, electronic pcr was carried out against unigene elements for quercus mongolica   <cit>  and castanopsis sieboldii   <cit> . there were  <dig> oak primer pairs that amplified qm with no mismatch and product size similar to that for european oaks. six primer pairs amplified two different qm sequences. for cs, there were  <dig> primer pairs that can amplify cs with no mismatch. one primer pair amplified two different cs sequences. seven primer pairs produced epcr products for both qm and cs. three primer pairs in the present study targeted three unigene elements for which ssr markers were already developed for qm.

comparison between genomic and est-derived ssrs
a total of  <dig> dinucleotide genomic ssrs from alberto et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> dinucleotide est-ssrs  were genotyped on the same set of  <dig> q. petraea genotypes described in  <cit> . the comparison  and allelic richness  showed that gssrs were more polymorphic  than est-ssrs . other diversity statistics as the size range of the ssr motifs and the number of alleles confirmed the lower level of polymorphism of est-ssrs compared to gssrs. the size of the ssr motif was on average  <dig>  bp for gssrs and  <dig>  bp for est-ssrs. the total number of alleles present in the tested population, regardless of their frequency was  <dig>  vs. for gssrs and  <dig>  bp for est-ssrs

bin mapping
the two parental maps established by saintagne et al.  <cit>  using mapmaker  <dig>   <cit>  were first reconstructed  using joinmap v <dig>   <cit>  based on the same  <dig> framework markers and  <dig> progenies. the female map was covered by  <dig> aflps,  <dig> rapds and  <dig> gssrs resulting in  <dig> marker intervals spanning  <dig>  cm. the male map was divided by  <dig> marker intervals and comprised  <dig> aflps,  <dig> rapds and  <dig> gssrs for a total map length of  <dig>  cm. each linkage map consisted in  <dig> linkage groups that corresponded to the number of haploid chromosomes in oak. compared to the map previously constructed using mapmaker, very few differences were noticed, consisting mainly in few inversions  and three unlinked markers . the total map lengths were however quite different . similar results have been reported elsewhere  and is attributed to the method used by the software to calculate kosambi genetic distances.

using the bin set of  <dig> offsprings, the framework maps were divided into  <dig> and  <dig> bins resulting in an average bin length of  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm for the female and male map, respectively. double crossing-overs were taken into account to define the bin set in order to minimize the effect of possible genotyping errors. the longest bins identified spanned  <dig>  cm  for the female and  <dig>  cm  for the male map. on average, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  different genotypic points between contiguous bins in the female and male maps. therefore, more genotypic combinations might exist to fit within intermediate positions.

a total of  <dig> polymorphic est-ssrs were genotyped on the bin set and the parents of the full- sib pedigree . overall  <dig> markers were assigned by graphical genotyping  to their respective bin. the remaining  <dig> markers corresponded either to markers segregating 1:2: <dig>  or presented ambiguous bin positions  and were therefore left out from the analysis. on the female map,  <dig> markers were assigned to bins, giving an average of  <dig>  markers per bins ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . on the male map,  <dig> markers were assigned to bins, giving an average of  <dig> markers per bin ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . overall, est-ssrs were evenly distributed across the linkage groups. more precisely, respectively  <dig> and  <dig> markers for the female and the male map presented exactly the same genotypic information as bin framework markers, i.e. these markers were positioned at the same location as the markers used for the definition of bins. the others,  <dig> and  <dig> markers in the female and in the male map, respectively, were positioned in the bins, presenting a genotype that was compatible with an intermediate bin between two successive bin markers. this is likely the result of large average bin size defined over low marker density framework maps. only  <dig> and  <dig> markers in the female and male maps were involved in one or more double crossing-overs, respectively. their genotypes were double checked, confirming this observation. these markers were visually assigned to their most probable bins.

validation of bin assignment
to test the efficiency of bin mapping, we first compare the known map location of  <dig> accessory gssrs  from the map constructed by barreneche et al.  <cit> , to their bin positions inferred from the graphical genotyping of  <dig> f1s. in all cases, both approaches agreed , i.e. markers were located either on the same bin  or an adjacent bin . an a posteriori validation was also performed for  <dig> est-ssrs  genotyped on  <dig> progenies. on the female map,  <dig> markers showed identical positions between bin assignment and map location ,  <dig> were located in an adjacent bin ,  <dig> was mapped on the same linkage group , and  <dig> presented a lod score for linkage <  <dig> . overall, the bin assignment was validated for 89% of the markers . for the male map,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers were of class a, b, c and d, respectively, corresponding to a validation rate of 88%. a slightly higher validation rate was obtained for another set of  <dig> est-ssrs  genotyped on  <dig> offsprings, i.e.  <dig> % on the female map ,  <dig> % on the male map .

macro-synteny and colinearity
about the conservation of macro-synteny between the male and female maps, it should be noticed that all the  <dig> inter-cross markers  were found on homologous linkage groups. a conserved macro-colinearity was also verified based on the  <dig> inter-cross markers  genotyped on the extended set of  <dig> progenies. these markers presented the same order on both maps as illustrated in additional file  <dig> - figure s <dig>  but with one exception on lg <dig>  given the number of comparisons,  <dig> occurrences with different orders were expected by chance alone at a 5% type i error rate. this investigation also provided the opportunity to test whether the male and female gametes presented different levels of recombination. based on  <dig> intervals flanked by the same adjacent markers in the male and female maps, no statistical difference was found using a t-test for paired comparisons .

discussion
frequency, distribution and polymorphism of the oak est-ssrs
est-derived ssrs have been searched for many years in plant, animal and microbial species. despite a lower rate of polymorphisms compared to genomic ssrs , est-ssrs offer a number of advantages over genomic ssrs  <cit> :  their development requires no investment in de novo sequencing;  they detect variation in the expressed portion of the genome;  the conservation of primer sites makes them readily transferable across closely related species as illustrated here between oak and chestnut; and  in most cases they can be exploited for population genetic analysis  <cit> .

the number of ssrs detected in ests largely depends on the size of the est catalogue, the algorithm  <cit>  and criteria  used to detect ssr-containing sequences. it is therefore difficult to conclude about the percentage of genes harbouring ssr motifs. this is apparent from several studies:  in oryza sativa  <dig> %  <cit>  and 50%  <cit>  of est-ssrs were detected using different software and criteria;  kumpatla and mukhopadhyay  <cit>  analysed  <dig>  million ests derived from  <dig> dicotyledonous species and found that  <dig>  to  <dig> % of ests contained at least one ssr; and  because the level of polymorphism is positively correlated with the length of the repeats region , some authors have chosen to use more stringent criteria  to increase the probability to find polymorphic ssr markers.

the availability of several genome sequences in angiosperms makes it possible to more accurately estimate the proportion of gene models harbouring ssrs in transcribed and utr regions. in poplar for example, about  <dig>  ssrs were found in coding regions and utrs  <cit> . therefore, taking into account the  <dig>  putative protein-coding genes  <cit> ,  <dig> % of the genes would present a ssr. in arabidopsis thaliana, 44% of the  <dig>  putative genes contain one or more ssrs  <cit> , but this figure also includes non transcribed regions.

in oak we found that  <dig> % of the unigenes presented at least one ssr motif. in two other fagaceae species, quercus mongolica  <cit>  and castanopsis sieboldii  <cit>  and it was found that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the putative unigenes presented microsatellite motifs . taking into account only di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats, these figures are very similar to our finding , although the detection parameters were different . also in terms of the abundance of motif types, our study agrees to that of ueno et al.  <cit>  and other studies performed in dicotyledonous species , i.e. ag and aag were the most abundant di- and trimeric ssrs, respectively. the extremely low number of ssr motifs containing c and g  could be attributed to the composition of dicot genes being less rich in g+c compared to monocots due to codon usage bias  <cit>  and to the intrinsic negative correlation between gc content and slippage rate  <cit> .

as expected, the most frequent ssr class corresponded to trinucleotides . this suggests that many of the detected est-ssrs are in protein-coding regions because changes in trinucleotide repeat number will not cause frame shifts unlike changes in other types of motifs  <cit> . indeed, the analysis of the distribution of the est-ssrs clearly showed that this type of ssr was frequently found  in coding regions in contrast to other ssrs. as for dimeric ssrs, the second most abundant type, our results confirm what has been obtained in other studies, i.e. they were mostly located in non-coding regions, despite a noticeable difference obtained between framedp  and estscan . overall, it should also be noticed that most of the est-ssrs found in non-coding region were located in the 5' utr . higher density of ssr in the 5' utr was also found in rice  <cit> . this result could be attributed to either a technical bias  or a biological feature of plant genes as discussed by grover et al.  <cit>  and fujimori et al.  <cit> . these authors found that rice and arabidopsis genes presented a higher rate of ssrs in the 5' flanking regions of the genes and interpreted this finding as a regulatory role in gene expression.

to further explore the accuracy of framedp and estscan results, we carried out a complementary analysis using poplar full length cdnas for which structural annotations were available  <cit> . the result of this analysis is provided as supplemental data . by comparing the ssr location based on true structural annotations it was clearly shown that estscan performed better than framedp, the later over-estimating the presence of dinucleotide motifs in coding regions as was found with the oak data. in agreement with the data reported in rice and arabidopsis, it was also found that ssrs were more frequent in the 5'utr of poplar genes .

a total of  <dig> primer pairs were designed and tested on a set of  <dig> genotypes, among which  <dig>  yielded amplicons. the failure for  <dig> % of the primers to generate an amplicon can be explained: i/ by the presence of large intronic regions preventing genomic dna to be amplified, ii/ the presence of snps/indel variation in the priming site of the tested genotypes, preventing the hybridization between the primers and the target dna, iii/ by the fact that a single pcr program was used without further optimisation, iv/ because the m <dig> tail  may interfer with appropriate pcr amplification  <cit> , and v/ because primers could have been designed for chimeric unigene elements. a large proportion  of the successful primer pairs were either monomorphic  or produced multibanding patterns or yielded faint amplification , thereby preventing the development of single copy ssrs. this study reveals that polymorphic ssrs  tended to have a higher number of repeats , ie.  <dig>  for di,  <dig>  for tri- and  <dig>  for hexa-ssrs, compared to monomorphic ones , i.e.  <dig>  for di-,  <dig>  for tri-, and  <dig>  for hexa-ssrs. the effect of repeat number and motif on the polymorphism was surveyed using logistic regression model by the r software v.  <dig> . <dig> , and the effect of repeat number was highly significant . this result agrees with the significant positive correlation that was found between ssr length and polymorphism rate in plants and animals  <cit> .

in oak, polymorphic markers were not evenly distributed among repeat classes, amounted to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and 36% for di- tri- and hexa- repeats, respectively. these figures confirm the higher level of polymorphism of dinucleotide repeats among plants  <cit> . the lower level of polymorphism for tri- and hexa- ssrs is mainly related to their location in translated sequences compared to dimeric ssrs that were preferentially distributed in utrs. these observations suggest that natural selection limit both the number and polymorphism rate of ssrs in translated regions of the genes. moreover, a closer examination among perfect di-and tri- oak ssrs showed that the level of polymorphism  depended on the type of motif. in particular, ssr markers with dinucleotide ac were the most polymorphic loci. these considerations should be taken into account for the development of additional polymorphic ssrs in oak that are conserved among the fagaceae species, comparative genomics being our ultimate goal. in that respect, we showed that oak dinucleotide est-ssrs were highly transferable to european chestnut.

bin mapping
linkage mapping is a time consuming process that requires large size recombinant populations  to locate polymorphic markers onto a genetic map. other methods that do not rely on meiotic recombination have also been developed to assign any genes to chromosomal locations, such as the use of aneuploid and deletion stocks in polyploids or radiation hybrid panels. one important advantage of these methods is that any sequence of interest is readily placed on a radiation hybrid or deletion map. in contrast, only polymorphic markers can be mapped on a genetic map. however, such approaches have been limited to a handful of plant species, including wheat  <cit> . alternatively, a computational method was developed  <cit>  to optimize the construction of high-density linkage maps using a reduced sample of selected offsprings presenting complementary recombinational events throughout the genome. a prerequisite to such selective/bin mapping approach is the availability of a high-confidence framework map. the first bin mapping approach was recently implemented in peach  <cit> . using only  <dig> f <dig> progenies, their f <dig> hybrid parent and one of the grand-parental lines, these authors successfully assigned  <dig> ssrs to  <dig> bins of the peach map. the bin mapping strategy was also used in melon , apple  and strawberry .

a bin mapping approach was developed for the first time in a forest tree species to increase the density of ssr markers in the oak linkage map and provide orthologous anchor markers for comparative mapping within the fagaceae. the selection of the bin set combined the use of mappop software and visual inspection of the data. it resulted in the selection of  <dig> plants, which was considered as a suitable size, as a set of  <dig> samples  fits in standard 96-well pcr plates. with this subset,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bins were obtained. as expected based on the number of different genotypic points between adjacent bins, about half of the markers presented a genotype that was compatible with a putative bin between two contiguous bins. to investigate the accuracy of the bin mapping approach, a large number of est-ssrs was genotyped on an extended set of genotypes . most markers assigned to bins or putative bins were placed in the expected position, validating the bin mapping strategy for oak, despite the low number of bins compared to similar studies  <cit> . at this stage, it is difficult to propose a general guideline for further bin mapping studies, but some general recommendations can be made: i/ number of individuals to be included in the bin set: it largely depends on the population and marker types. for instance, there are more genotypic informations in f2s as compared to f1s for codominant markers . therefore, less individuals will be needed to define the bins with f <dig> genotypes. it also depends on technical constraints,  <dig> individuals emerging as a magic number in the few bin mapping studies published so far in plants, since  <dig> samples, corresponding to  <dig> offsprings and two parental lines, fits well in a single raw of a 384-well microtiter plate!, ii/ number of bins: it obviously depends on the number of linkage groups and on the number of individuals included in the bin set .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we used an est catalog produced for quercus petraea and q. robur, to mine and develop est-derived ssrs. we observed a relatively high abundance of single sequence repeats in the oak transcriptome,  <dig> % of the unigene elements harboring at least one ssr. despite being less polymorphic than gssrs, their many advantages make them markers of choice for genetic analyses. in particular, these functional markers directly sample variations in genes, which enhance their value for analyzing the genetic basis of forest tree adaptation through the use of non neutral, so called "functional" markers in genetic diversity analysis, qtl and association mapping studies as well as comparative genomics.

the present study contributed  <dig> gene-derived microsatellite markers,  <dig> of which were efficiently assigned to a bin position using  <dig> informative individuals. the development and distribution of this reference set of highly recombinant genotypes to the "european oak mapping community" has been instrumental for the development and mapping of this new set of high quality markers that also proved to be useful in a related species .
