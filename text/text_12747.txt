BACKGROUND
high-temperature stress has devastating effects on plant growth and productivity, and is a growing concern in the context of global climate change  <cit> . temperatures 5°c above optimal growing conditions will induce heat shock or heat stress to plants  <cit> . every year, there is substantial crop yield loss due to the elevated temperature and drought stress  <cit> . the development of genetically heat-resistant plants has been considered as a promising approach for alleviating the threats from high-temperature stress  <cit> .

heat tolerance of plants is a complex multigenic process with different regulatory mechanisms sets throughout the gene network during plant development  <cit> . larkindale et al.  <cit>  reported that each of  <dig> arabidopsis mutants had different responses to high temperature, which were involved in signaling pathways  and reactive oxygen metabolism . additionally, aba, sa or active oxygen molecule may serve as one signal to regulate gene chain in heat tolerant arabidopsis. although many researches on heat-stress tolerance have advanced considerably in recent years, genome-wide comparisons in plants have not yet been made using the next-generation high-throughput sequencing technologies. determining the multigenic net regulatory mechanisms of plant response to high temperature, particularly at the transcriptomic level, will be helpful in the development of heat-tolerant species.

tall fescue  is a forage and cool-season turfgrass species grown widely in the temperate regions of the world such as in united states, china, japan, australia and many countries in europe because of its agronomic importance . however, high temperature  is one of the limiting factors affecting forage production and turf management of tall fescue in the south such as the great plains of the u.s. and south of the yangtze rive in china  <cit> .

the genome size of tall fescue is approximately 6 ×  <dig> mbp and about  <dig> times larger than that of rice   <cit> . to date, complete genome sequences of tall fescue are not achieved. although  <dig>   <dig> expressed sequence tags  had been deposited in the ncbi genbank database as of june  <dig>  molecular resouces of tall fescue are still limited because of the lack of genomic and transcriptomic information. an accelerated effort to acquire transcriptomes of tall fescue in response to high-temperature stress will be helpful in the development of heat-tolerant tall fescue cultivars. in the current study, two tall fescue genotypes, heat tolerant pi <dig> and heat sensitive pi <dig> identified from  <dig> tall fescue genotypes in our previous study   <cit> , were used to investigate responses to high temperature at a global transcriptional level using an high-throughput rna sequencing  approach. the objectives of this study were  to provide an initial investigation of genome-wide transcriptomic analysis;  to reveal novel insights into the regulation pattern of certain candidate genes in the critical metabolic pathways response to heat stress in cool-season turfgrass species.

RESULTS
analyses of rna-seq data
cool-season turfgrass and forage grass species are especially sensitive to heat stress  <cit> . heat stress-induced injury may take place on the leaf at first  <cit> . leaves of heat tolerant pi <dig> and heat sensitive pi <dig> were collected at  <dig> and 36 hour after treatment  based upon earlier studies  <cit>  and our pre-experiment for rna-seq analysis. the results of this study described the gene-level transcriptome in response to heat stress conditions in two tall fescue genotypes differing in high-temperature tolerance. using the illumina hiseq  <dig> system , a total of  <dig> million high-quality 100-bp paired-end reads were sequenced and assembled into a reference transcriptome of tall fescue , which is also the first transcriptome library in the grass species to be reported. a total of  <dig>  contigs were produced with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp, average length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> of 821 bp for pi578718; a total of  <dig>  contigs with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp, average length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> of 806 bp for pi <dig> were assembled, respectively. pi <dig> obtained  <dig>  transcripts with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp, average length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> of  <dig>  bp; pi <dig> obtained  <dig>  transcripts with a maximum length of  <dig>  bp, average length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> of  <dig>  bp.table  <dig>

using the trinity software, a final total of  <dig>  unigenes  from  <dig>  transcripts were generated, whose average length of  <dig>  bp was longer than those reported in other plants, such as litchi   <cit> , bracken fern   <cit> , tea   <cit> .  <dig>   unigenes of these  <dig>  unigenes were matched with the homologs in databases with known function for tall fescue. a transcriptome atlas of two wheat genotypes response to heat treatments using microarray analyses only detected the expression of  <dig>  probe sets  <cit> . other suppression subtractive hybridization -based studies involved in high temperature response just detected the expression of  <dig>  transcripts in fescue  seeds of pi  <dig> and pi <dig>  <cit> . the unigenes obtained from a recent whole-genome-wide transcriptional analysis in two tall fescue genotypes under stress could greatly enrich the gene expression library response to high temperature in the grass family, especially in turfgrass and forage grasses. this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gbyn <dig>  the version described in this paper is the first version, gbyn <dig> 

go enrichment of the tall fescue heat transcriptome
on the basis of gene ontology  analysis,  <dig>  unigenes were identified to be differential heat response between the two genotypes under different heat treatments, and were categorized into  <dig> go functional subcategories , which were summarized into three main categories: biological process , cellular components  and molecular function . genes encoding cellular process  and metabolic process  proteins were the most enriched in the biological process category. the result is in agreement with the result from litchi fruits in response to shading stress  <cit> . genes encoding cellular process  and metabolic process  proteins were the most enriched in the biological process category. within the cellular components, proteins related to cell , cytoplasm , intracellular  and membrane  were enriched. under the molecular function category, the molecular function  and binding  were the most highly represented go terms .figure  <dig> 
functional categorization of assembled unigenes based on gene ontology  classification in leaves of two tall fescue genotypes .  functional categorization of entire genes for all treatment lines of two genotypes ;  functional categorization of genes for 36 h heat-stressed pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  the unigenes were summarized in three main go categories  and  <dig> subcategories. the y-axis indicates the number of unigenes in each class and the x-axis indicates the subcategories.



the number of functional subcategories and variance degree in these three categories increased along with increased treatment time . pi  <dig>  one of the most heat-hardy wild tall fescue genotype, may have a larger number of genes enriching in go categories. however, rna-seq results did not support this hypothesis. on the contrary, a greater number of genes  were seen in the heat sensitive pi <dig>  in addition, the gene variance degree between the two genotypes in the same go subcategories reached the maximum at the longest treatment time. at  <dig> hat, genes involved in  <dig> subcategories from three main go categories in the heat-sensitive genotype had more than two times enrichment than in the heat- tolerant genotype. furthermore, genes, just encoding abscission, death, enzyme regulator activity, pollination, cytoskeleton, golgi apparatus, nucleolus, ribosome, structural molecule activity and thylakoid proteins, were more enriched in the heat-tolerant genotype than in the heat-sensitive genotype at  <dig> hat . similar results were reported in grapevine shoot apices in response to cold stress  <cit> .

cog functional annotation and classification of the tall fescue transcriptome
the function of assembled unigenes was further evaluated using clusters of orthologous groups  analysis. overall,  <dig>   unigenes were assigned to  <dig> cog categories . in the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for ‘function unknown’  represented the largest group, followed by ‘general function prediction only’ , ‘signal transduction mechanisms’  and ‘posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’ , ‘transcription’ , ‘carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ , ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’ , ‘secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism’  and ‘lipid transport and metabolism’ . only a small portion of the unigenes were assigned to ‘cell motility’  or ‘undetermined’ . compared with previous studies on peanut   <cit> , longan   <cit> , litchi   <cit> , these tall fescue unigenes could be more annotated through cog system .  <dig> % unigenes in tall fescue were clustered in ‘function unknown’, because the cog functional annotation analysis was searched against five databases from close kinship species: brachypodium hereafter , wheat , rice , maize , sorghum . however, the other unigenes were relatively uniformly distributed in the cog categories, except the unigenes in ‘general function prediction only’  and ‘posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’ .figure  <dig>

the unigenes variance degree between the two genotypes in the same cog categories also exhibited the maximum at the longest treatment time. at  <dig> hat, unigenes involved in  <dig> cog categories in the heat-sensitive genotype had more than two times enrichment than in the heat- tolerant genotype . at  <dig> hat, unigenes just encoding ‘coenzyme transport and metabolism’ in the heat-sensitive tall fescue had more than two times enrichment than in the heat-tolerant tall fescue . at  <dig> hat, unigenes encoding ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’ and ‘cytoskeleton’ proteins in the heat-sensitive tall fescue had more than two times enrichment than in the heat-tolerant tall fescue . unigenes involved in ‘chromatin structure and dynamics’ and ‘defense mechanisms’ in the heat-tolerant tall fescue had more two times enrichment than in the heat-sensitive tall fescue at  <dig> hat and  <dig> hat, respectively . under high-temperature stress, higher enrichment of the tall fescue unigenes in the most of cog categories for heat-sensitive genotypes compared with heat-tolerant ones suggests that thermotolerance was related with the changed expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation as well as metabolic pathways  <cit> .

differential expression of transcripts are affected by high-temperature stress
in order to identify the relationship of genome-wide expression profiles between different genotypes and different treatments, all annotated unigenes from six heat-treated samples were clustered with the software cluster  <dig>  . the genes detected in the different genotypes or different treatment times were clearly separated. this result further proved that the thermotolerance diversity between pi <dig> and pi <dig> was regulated by genes, and the sampling at  <dig> and  <dig> hat was suitable to obtain the richest differential expression genes. in addition, heat map of identified genes also showed that the transcript abundance for most of genes under short heat treatment  was lower than that under the long heat treatment .figure  <dig> 
average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis of the log <dig> transformed changed ratio of  <dig>  ungenes with cluster  <dig>  software. the resulting tree figures were displayed using the software package, java treeview. red, up-regulation; green, down-regulation; black, no change. 71–0 h, 12 h and 36 h represent pi  <dig> under heat stress for  <dig>   <dig> and 36 h; 159–0 h, 12 h and 36 h represent pi  <dig> under heat stress for  <dig>   <dig> and 36 h.



the venn diagram analysis of differential expression unigenes in treatment lines relative to the control lines  also showed the same result . as shown in venn diagrams, there were more common genes detected in both genotypes at  <dig> hat than at  <dig> hat . for pi  <dig>  whether up-regulation or down-regulation, the number of differential expression unigenes was larger at  <dig> hat than  <dig> hat. for pi  <dig>  the number of activated unigenes was larger at  <dig> hat than  <dig> hat . the result suggests that the pattern of increased transcript abundance along with the increased stress time was one important response mechanism to high temperature in grass, as previously found for the total of  <dig>  genes analyzed by microarray in heat stressed mussels   <cit> . in addition, more genes showed decreased transcript abundance regardless of heat tolerant or sensitive genotypes. the result indicates that cool-season turfgrass and forage grass may have more negative regulated genes compared with positive regulation ones in the heat stress response pathway. qin et al.  <cit>  reported that heat-tolerant ‘tam107’ had more differential expression genes relative to heat-sensitive ‘cs’  at  <dig> hat, but less differential expression genes at  <dig> hat in wheat using microarray analysis. the results in this study showed that heat-tolerant pi <dig>  had more differential expression genes relative to heat-sensitive pi <dig>  at all heat treatment times . the greater genes with differential transcript abundance in the heat tolerant genotype may speak to the complexity of thermotolerance in grass.figure  <dig>

cell cycle and division are affected by high temperature stress
the expression data annotated by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway category “cell cycle”  consisted of  <dig> unigenes in both tall fescue genotypes in response to high temperature stress .  <dig> genes of these  <dig> unigenes showed different transcript abundance. ten genes were activated in heat tolerant pi <dig>  but only three genes were activated in heat sensitive pi  <dig>  stem cell factor , p <dig> and e2f have been suggested as the critical regulators of g <dig> to s-phase progression  <cit> . the scf gene  related to elimination of the s-phase cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase  inhibitor sic <dig> inhibiting cell progress from g <dig> to s-phase was found to be up-regulated in pi <dig> at  <dig> hat. identification of p <dig>  was shown as one of the critical regulators in the elevation of e2f activity driving cells from g <dig> into s-phase, and showed increased transcript abundance in two grass genotypes. although high-temperature stress did not induce significant changes of e2f <dig>  expression, more transcript abundance for e2f <dig> in pi  <dig> was obtained than in pi <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hat.figure  <dig>

in response to heat stress in tall fescue, cell division control protein  <dig> gene  initiating dna replication showed increased expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hat in pi  <dig>  under exogenous environment stress, s-phase cells are susceptible to chromosomal damage because of the potential replication errors  <cit> . minichromosome maintenance  and origin recognition complex  family proteins are essential components in dna replication licensing and play a key role in preventing centrosome reduplication, particularly for mcm complex in s-phase checkpoint activation and in subsequent lesion repair  <cit> . at  <dig> hat, orc <dig>  and orc <dig>  were activated in pi <dig> and pi <dig>  respectively, but were unaffected in grass leaves at  <dig> hat. the transcript abundance of both mcm <dig>  and mcm <dig>  increased in the heat-stressed pi <dig>  but were unaffected in heat-stressed pi <dig>  the result suggests that the heat-tolerant pi <dig> had greater ability to self-repair to protect s-phase genome stability than the heat-sensitive pi  <dig> 

plant cyclins are typically classified as a, b, c, or d-types  <cit> . cyclin a protein is present in the s-phase to m phase and plays a major role in the control of dna replication, and cyclin d regulates the g1-s transition  <cit> . two cyclins  were detected for the first time in tall fescue by genome wide rna-seq analysis. ccna  was identified activated in heat-stressed pi <dig>  unaffected in heat-stressed pi <dig>  however, cycd <dig> showed decreased transcript abundance in 12 h-treated pi <dig>  the 14-3- <dig> proteins are a family of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine binding molecules that promote cell survival and control the function of a wide array of cellular proteins  <cit> . 14-3- <dig> epsilon  was detected with increased expression at  <dig> hat in pi  <dig>  but not in heat-stressed pi  <dig> 

one sister-chromatid cohesion gene  plays a vital role in keeping sister chromatid cohesion at spindle checkpoint until the activation of separase by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome   <cit> . cdc20/fizzy and cdh1/fizzy-related complex are critical for the activity of multisubunit e <dig> ubiquitin ligase apc/c and then triggers the degradation of multiple substrates during mitosis  <cit> . in this study, scc <dig>  and cdc <dig>  showed increased transcript abundance at  <dig> hat in pi  <dig>  cdc <dig> showed increased expression at  <dig> hat in pi  <dig>  apc <dig>  and e-cadherin gene   had more transcript abundance in pi <dig> than in pi <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hat, respectively. however, there was no significant change between pi <dig> and pi <dig> at  <dig> hat. the results suggest that scc1and cdc <dig> play more important role in protecting m-phase stability in tall fescue in response to heat stress.

energy metabolism is affected by high temperature stress
in the tall fescue leaf, of the  <dig> annotated unigenes,  <dig> unigenes in the kegg category “energy metabolism” were significantly affected by high temperature, mainly involved in six kinds of assimilation pathway: “photosynthesis ”, “photosynthesis-antenna proteins ”, “carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms ”, “methane metabolism ”, “nitrogen metabolism ” and “sulfur metabolism ”, and one dissimilation “oxidative phosphorylation ” . assimilation and dissimilation are the two important aspects of the energy metabolism, and the balance of energy metabolism process between assimilation and dissimilation is fundamental to the maintenance of cell life, the source of its life and development  <cit> . in “energy metabolism”, most of the genes  involved in assimilation, such as “photosynthesis”, “photosynthesis-antenna proteins” and “carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms” showed decreased transcript abundance in two tall fescue genotypes under heat stress. in the methane, nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways, there were also more genes  inhibited in the two tall fescue genotypes. however, most of the genes involved in dissimilation, such as “oxidative phosphorylation” showed increased transcript abundance in the heat-tolerant pi  <dig>  and only inhibited in heat-sensitive pi <dig> . the result finding indicates that pi <dig> obtained more energy than pi <dig> in response to high temperature stress. the expression data suggest that greater dissimilation metabolism in pi <dig> relative to pi <dig> may result in a more stable cell division in pi <dig> than in pi <dig> in response to high temperature. in the three pathways methane, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, there were more genes inhibited in pi <dig> than in pi <dig>  one gene encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  showed increased abundance in pi  <dig>  but decreased in pi  <dig> under heat stress. the transcript abundance of a ferredoxin gene  belonging to this pathway was dramatically increased at all treatment times in pi  <dig> but decreased at  <dig> hat in pi <dig> 

hsp and antioxidant genes are affected by high temperature stress
plants respond to high temperature by synthesizing a set of the heat shock proteins  to acquire thermotolerance  <cit> . according to their predicted molecular weight, hsps could be grouped into three families: high molecular weight , hsp <dig> , low molecular weight   <cit> . many researches have proved that the increased transcript abundance of the three kinds of hsps and their molecular chaperone was directly involved in the activation of protection mechanisms in response to heat stress . however, in contrast with these results, very few hsp <dig> genes showed differential expression in the two tall fescue genotypes under heat stress . moreover, heat transfer products group  encoding the molecular chaperone htpg protein and hspbp <dig> encoding hsp70-interacting protein showed decreased transcript abundance at  <dig> hat in pi <dig>  it is interesting to find that nine hsp <dig> genes showed increased transcript abundance in all treatment lines for the both genotypes, and two hsp90b genes increased abundance in heat-stressed pi  <dig>  which suggests that the lmw-hsp and hmw-hsp may play a more important role in enhancing thermotolerance for tall fescue. there is new evidence showing that plants have developed antioxidant enzymatic systems for scavenging antioxidant enzymes to avoid these oxidative injuries induced by abiotic stress  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> antioxidant genes, in the kegg category “peroxisome”, regulating antioxidant enzyme activity, were significantly affected in both heat-stressed genotypes and the tolerant genotype had more antioxidant genes activated than in the sensitive genotype . particularly, three sod genes increased transcript abundance at  <dig> hat in pi <dig> but were unaffected in heat-stressed pi <dig>  the result suggests that the high expression level of antioxidant genes may be one key functional trait to identify the heat tolerance in tall fescue species.

quantitative real-time-pcr validation of differentially expressed transcripts from rna-seq
eighteen randomly selected genes were used to confirm their expression patterns of the illumina rna-seq results by quantitative real-time pcr . nine genes, encoding snf-related serine/threonine-protein kinase , transcription factor tga, small auxin upregulated rna  family protein , protein phosphatase 2c , auxin influx carrier , ethylene receptor  and two-component response regulator arr-a family , were involved in hormone metabolism, while another two genes, encoding 90 kda beta hsp  and molecular chaperone htpg , were related to hsp metabolism. two genes encoding protein phosphatase  <dig> , regulatory subunit b  and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c  were related to protein phosphorylation reaction. the remaining five genes encoded solute carrier family  <dig> , omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase , glutamine synthetase , cytochrome c  and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase , respectively. as listed in additional file  <dig>  eleven unigenes were inhibited and five unigenes were activated in the two grass. the qpcr results showed a similar change trend for all tested unigenes in the heat stressed and non-stressed grass . slc25a4s, saur <dig> and aux <dig> in pi <dig> showed increased transcript abundance in the treatment lines relative to controls. fad <dig> in stressed pi  <dig> inhibited. five unigenes  showed decreased transcript abundance in both tall fescue genotypes under heat stress. cyc, siah <dig> and hsp90b showed significantly higher expression compared to the controls in two grass genotypes. in pi <dig> heat stressed lines, snrk2- <dig> and snrk2- <dig> showed increased transcript abundance at  <dig> and  <dig> hat, respectively. pp2c showed increased transcript abundance at  <dig> hat in pi <dig>  etr showed increased transcript abundance at  <dig> hat in two grass genotypes. cyc and siah <dig> showed increased abundance at  <dig> hat in two grass genotypes. further, correlation between rna-seq and qpcr was evaluated using log <dig> expression level. as shown in figure  <dig>  the qpcr measurements were moderately correlated with rna-seq results , which indicated that these rna-seq data was accuracy and effective, and can be used for gene expression profiles analysis during the tall fescue high temperature defence response.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study provided the first large-scale transcriptome dataset in cool-season turfgrass in response to high-temperature stress. more than  <dig> million high-quality 100-bp paired-end reads paired-end reads were generated and assembled  <dig>  unigenes in tall fescue. furthermore,  <dig>  unigenes expressed specifically in tall fescue under high-temperature stress, as well as their classification, functions, and metabolic pathways were shown for the first time. high expression levels of genes involved in lmw -hsp, antioxidants, cell cycle and cell division and dissimilation  in tall fescue respond to heat stress could play a vital role in achieving thermotolerance.
