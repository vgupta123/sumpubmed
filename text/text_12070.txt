BACKGROUND
the global incidence of diabetes is expected to cross the  <dig> million mark by  <dig>  <cit> . with current treatment strategies being inadequate in addressing the complications associated with the disease  <cit> , an alternative cell-based therapy approach is urgently needed. the edmonton protocol was the first to provide a proof-of-concept of a cell-based therapy for diabetes  <cit> . however, due to a severe shortage of donor pancreases as well as other complications associated with the procedure itself such as the need for life-long immunosuppression and failure to achieve complete insulin independence  <cit> , alternative approaches need to be examined. multipotent cells from foetal tissue may provide one such alternative.

to date, attempts have been made to differentiate amnion epithelial cells , placenta-derived multipotent progenitor cells and amniotic fluid stem cells down the pancreatic lineage . however, multiple protocols exist for the differentiation of the same cell type. further, the molecular basis of the differentiation process and individual media components have not yet been studied. the present study aims to bridge this gap in current research.

the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox- <dig>  is a master regulator of pancreatic development and differentiation  <cit> . it is responsible for the differentiation of progenitor cells into cells of the endocrine pancreas. the complex ductal architecture of the pancreas is also established by a reiterative program of branching morphogenesis which proceeds concomitantly with peak pdx <dig> transcription factor expression  <cit> . pdx <dig> has been suggested to play a critical role in the developmental re-programming of the pancreas from cells of unrelated tissues such as keratinocytes and amniotic fluid stem cells  <cit> . furthermore, induced pdx <dig> expression in human and non-human primate amniotic fluid-derived stem cells  cultured on plo-coated plates, was shown to initiate pancreatic differentiation  <cit> . pdx <dig> is thus, an important factor in the development of both the pancreatic islet and ductal cells.

epidermal growth factor  is a standard component of human amnion epithelial cell growth media as it improves the growth of these cells  <cit> . in the developing pancreas, egf increases the mass of pancreatic epithelial cells whereas a lack of it promotes endocrine differentiation  <cit> . when administered to adult pigs, excess of egf leads to pancreatic duct hyperplasia  <cit> . one aspect of this study therefore is to study the effect of egf on haecs that are being differentiated down the pancreatic lineage.

plo is a synthetic amino acid chain that is positively charged and widely used as a coating to enhance cell attachment and adhesion to both plastic ware and glass surfaces. plo has previously been used in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into insulin-producing clusters  <cit> .

in this study, we have used ectopic expression of mpdx <dig> as a potential approach for the differentiation of haecs into pancreatic progenitors. we found that endogenous pdx <dig> expression was induced several fold upon mpdx <dig> transduction. several other genes that are expressed by pancreatic progenitor cells such as sox <dig>  rfx <dig>  cftr and foxa <dig> were also expressed. the presence of egf and plo in the culture environment potentiated this expression. a two-tailed t-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the observed changes in gene dynamics.

RESULTS
baseline expression of pancreatic regulatory genes in haecs  showed high ck <dig> and sox <dig> expression  . in fact ck <dig> expression was higher in haecs compared to adult human islets. moderate rfx <dig> expression  was also observed. expression of all other genes that were tested was either very low or absent in haecs . we therefore attempted to initiate the process of pancreatic differentiation of haecs by transient transduction of mpdx <dig>  a critical factor in the development of the pancreas.fig.  <dig> comparison of average cq values between untransduced p <dig> haecs and crude human islet preparations for pancreatic progenitor-specific genes. pancreatic progenitor-specific genes were assayed by means of qpcr for untransduced p <dig> haecs  and crude human islet preparations . error bars represent mean ± sd. it can be noted that endogenous ck <dig> and sox <dig> expression is high in untransduced haecs while expression of pdx <dig>  rfx <dig>  sox <dig>  foxa <dig> and nkx <dig>  is virtually absent 



effect of mpdx <dig> transduction
transduction of haecs with non-integrating, recombinant adenovirus harbouring the mouse pdx <dig> gene was successful. transduction efficiency increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner from  <dig> to  <dig> multiplicity of infection  of the adenoviruses . however, since higher concentrations of the adenoviral vector caused increased cell death over an extended culture period, we performed all subsequent experiments with  <dig> moi of the virus. transduction efficiency was 12 % at 24 h and 69 % at 48 h at this viral titre.

subsequent to mpdx <dig> transduction, there was a dramatic increase in expression of endogenous human pdx <dig>  at day  <dig>  expression was almost 200-fold higher than untransduced controls . expression increased marginally up to 7 days post-transduction. the expression of the pdx <dig> gene was confirmed by comparing pdx <dig> gene expression in cells that were transduced with a control egfp adenovirus. egfp transduction did not cause expression of pdx <dig> .fig.  <dig> effect of adenoviral transduction of human amnion epithelial cells on pancreatic marker gene expression. fold-change expression of human pancreatic marker genes was assayed by means of qpcr  2 days and  7 days after mpdx <dig> adenoviral transduction of p <dig> haecs. fold-change is relative to untreated cells. error bars represent mean ± sd. only those genes with a cq < <dig> are represented here. of the  <dig> genes assayed, expression of  <dig> genes on day  <dig> and  <dig> genes on day  <dig> were detected.  five genes in particular- nanog, sox <dig>  ngn <dig>  neurod <dig> and pax4—showed significant increase in expression while rfx <dig> and rfx <dig> showed a significant loss of expression over the 7 day period. 



expression of pdx <dig> in turn caused many other pancreatic marker genes to be expressed . in particular, there was a greater than 200-fold increase in sox <dig> expression and a greater than 1000-fold increase in rfx <dig> expression in mpdx <dig> transduced cells as compared to untransduced controls on day  <dig> post-transduction . although there was a further 2-fold increase in sox <dig> expression, rfx <dig> expression dropped by approximately 3-fold at the end of the culture period. rfx <dig> expression also dropped significantly by the 7th day . interestingly, the pancreatic endocrine progenitor markers- ngn <dig>  neurod <dig> and pax <dig> began to be expressed by day  <dig>  albeit at low levels . significant expression of markers of β-cell committed cells viz. nkx <dig> , nkx <dig>  and pax <dig> were also observed at the 2 day and 7 day time points although the difference in expression of these genes between the two time points was not significant. further, expression of adult endocrine pancreas marker genes, gcg and ppy, also began by day  <dig> although this seemed to be more of an effect of the adenoviral transduction itself because even egfp expressing cells expressed these two markers.

microscopically, it was observed that cell proliferation ceased upon transduction with mpdx <dig>  this was not the case with control cells transduced with egfp .

expression of rfx <dig> and rfx <dig> at the protein level was confirmed by western blot analysis .

effect of egf on mpdx <dig> transduction
since previous reports have suggested that an environment lacking egf drives the pancreatic differentiation process forward, we investigated if this is indeed the case for haecs transduced with mpdx <dig> 

in general it was observed that a lack of egf in the culture medium, did not make any statistically significant difference to gene expression  although by day  <dig> there seemed to be a loss of gene expression across the marker panel, including the endocrine pancreas markers. however this was observed as a less than 1-fold change in expression in  <dig> of  <dig> genes tested. subsequent experiments therefore continued to be carried out in the presence of 10 ng/ml egf.fig.  <dig> effect of egf on mpdx <dig> transduction. the expression of human pancreatic marker genes by mpdx1-transduced haecs in a culture environment lacking egf was assayed by means of qpcr over a 7 day period.  gene expression in cells grown in the absence of egf for  <dig> days  gene expression in cells grown in the absence of egf for  <dig> days  comparison of gene expression in cells grown in the absence of egf for  <dig> and  <dig> days. fold change was compared to cells grown in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml egf. although it appeared that there was a loss of gene expression across the panel by the 7th day, this loss was not significant when compared to expression in cells grown in an environment containing egf. . error bars represent mean ± sd



combined effect of egf and plo on mpdx <dig> transduction
pancreatic differentiation experiments with afscs have previously shown low level of insulin mrna expression only in cells grown on a plo coating  <cit> . we wanted to check therefore if growing the adenovirally transduced haecs on plo-coated plates would potentiate the process of pancreatic differentiation.

it was observed that the gene expression dynamics of cells growing on plo was more or less the same irrespective of the concentration. however culture on  <dig>  % plo resulted in a statistically significant higher expression of most genes . specifically, expression of endogenous pdx <dig> was higher in cells cultured on  <dig>  % plo on both days as compared to their non-plo counterparts as well as cells grown with a higher concentration of plo . contrastingly, rfx <dig> expression was higher in  <dig>  % plo cultures on both days. expression of other genes such as nkx <dig> , nkx <dig> , neurod <dig>  pax <dig>  sox <dig>  pax <dig>  gcg and ppy varied with culture condition and day of culture although their expression was significantly higher than their non-plo counterparts. in general, the combined effect of egf and plo caused an increase in expression of the early gene markers such as pax <dig>  pax <dig> and sox <dig>  by the 7th day, the expression of these genes fell whereas those of later genes such as ngn <dig> and neurod <dig> increased although ngn <dig> expression was not statistically significant.fig.  <dig> combined effect of egf and plo on mpdx <dig> transduction. two days and 7 days after mpdx <dig> adenoviral transduction of p <dig> haecs grown in the presence of egf and plo, the expression of human pancreatic marker genes was assayed by means of qpcr. expression was compared to cells that were cultured only in the presence of egf. mrna expressions were normalized to endogenous gapdh expression. similar to transduced cells cultured with egf alone, the  <dig> genes- nkx <dig> , pax <dig>  pdx <dig>  rfx <dig>  sox <dig>  cftr and foxa2—showed a dramatic and higher change in expression upon mpdx <dig> transduction. in most cases, expression of genes in cells grown on plo was higher than their non-plo counterpart. 



under the microscope it was observed that the lower concentration of plo was less cytotoxic .

discussion
the human amnion is a foetal membrane that surrounds the placenta and is derived from the epiblast as early as 8 days after fertilization  <cit> . there are  <dig> births worldwide every minute  <cit> . more than half of the placentas obtained post-partum are discarded. since the placenta and its surrounding membranes act as a maternal-foetal interface, it is quite likely that multipotent progenitor cells can be obtained from them. several studies have in fact, shown the extraordinary differentiation potential of placenta derived multi progenitor cells and human amnion epithelial cells into cells of all three dermal lineages including the endocrine pancreas, neuronal cells etc.  <cit> . the present study has added to the knowledge obtained from such studies.

the complex development of the pancreas involves a fine play between several transcription factors, chief amongst which is the transcription factor pdx <dig> . in the present study, endogenous hpdx <dig> expression was activated. this caused cells to stop proliferating and to undergo differentiation instead.

once pdx <dig> expression was activated, many other downstream genes involved in the pancreatic differentiation process were also activated, chief amongst which was the dramatic expression of rfx <dig>  although rfx <dig> has been suggested to be an ngn3-dependent transcription factor  <cit> , we observed a significant, albeit low level of ngn <dig> expression only at the 7 day time point by which time rfx <dig> expression had decreased 3-fold. a significant increase in expression of other genes downstream of ngn <dig> such as neurod <dig> and pax <dig> were also observed at this point, although the expression of these genes was very low in terms of cq.

general endoderm marker, sox <dig>  and anterior endoderm marker, foxa <dig>  expression were increased. it was observed that as the expression of these two genes increased over the 7 day period, there was a corresponding loss of rfx <dig> expression. this is consistent with pearl et. al’s observation in the xenopus system where rfx <dig> was expressed in two waves, the first of which occurs in the anterior endoderm, up stream of ngn <dig> expression <cit> . however they also positioned rfx <dig> up stream of pdx <dig> since they observed lower gene expression of pdx <dig> in rfx <dig> knockouts. our observation differed in that we did not see a loss of pdx <dig> expression as rfx <dig> expression reduced. in fact, pdx <dig> expression continued to increase over the 7 days in cultures containing egf and  <dig>  % plo. corroborating evidence is provided by suzuki et al. who observed significant loss of rfx <dig> expression upon pdx <dig> silencing in mouse intestinal epithelial cells but did not see any significant effect of rfx <dig> silencing on pdx <dig> expression  <cit> . this suggests that some of our cells were still in the early stages of pancreatic development similar to soyer j et al.’s observation that rfx <dig> is initially expressed in the pdx1-positive gut endoderm cells in mice and zebrafish  <cit> .

upon the extended culture time period, the expression of the multipotent pancreatic duct-like cell markers of foxa <dig> and cftr increased. while there was no significant expression of endocrine cell markers such as mafa and ins, there was a greater than 10-fold increase in expression of the alpha cell marker, gcg and pp cell marker, ppy. egf alone could sustain this expression over the entire duration of culture.

since haecs have a high endogenous ck <dig> and sox <dig> expression , the fold-change in mrna expression of these two genes upon adenoviral transduction even with culture on plo, was not significant. however, we hypothesize that the high endogenous expression of ck <dig> and sox <dig>  coupled with the induced expression of pdx <dig> and other pancreatic marker genes, lead the cells down the pancreatic lineage. indeed, since the cells were positive for both sox <dig> and pdx <dig>  markers of the posterior foregut, we hypothesize that some of the cells are similar to e <dig> - <dig>  mouse embryonic pancreatic epithelium  <cit>  or primary pancreatic progenitor cells  <cit> . interestingly, wescott et al. observed that pdx1hi/insulin-negative cells may represent branching epithelia  <cit>  and cardinale v et al. identified multipotent stem/progenitors in high numbers in the hepato-pancreatic common duct  <cit> . the cells which they identified were positive for endodermal transcription factors viz. sox <dig>  sox <dig>  foxa <dig>  pdx <dig>  ngn3; stem/progenitor surface markers viz. epcam, ncam, cd <dig>  cxcr4; and sometimes weakly, adult liver, bile duct, and pancreatic genes viz. albumin, cftr and insulin, respectively. since we were able to observe expression of some these markers in our cells as well, it provides further evidence to the possibility of our cells representing a mixed population of cells along varying degrees of pancreatic differentiation some of which are similar to the multipotent progenitors of the pancreatic duct.

although earlier studies have indicated that a lack of egf in the culture environment drives the differentiation process  <cit> , there are some others which have suggested a role for egf and its family members in establishing islet architecture  <cit> . in the present study we found that egf was required to sustain and in some cases even increase the expression of pancreatic marker genes. while a lack of egf reduced the stemness of the differentiating haecs, it also caused a significant loss of later stage pancreatic markers including the alpha cell marker, gcg.

human and non-human primate amniotic fluid-derived stem cells  have previously been induced to express pdx <dig> when cultured on plo-coated plates. this was shown to initiate pancreatic differentiation  <cit> . in this study, it was observed that while plo itself did not initiate pancreatic differentiation, it greatly potentiated pancreatic differentiation upon mpdx <dig> transduction. what was interesting to observe was that in conditions where a lack of egf resulted in a higher expression of a particular gene marker, a concentration of  <dig>  % plo provided similar results. when egf or a lower concentration of plo was introduced into the culture environment, the gene expression levels fell. it seems therefore, that a delicate balance between egf and plo needs to be achieved in order to drive differentiation as opposed to the maintenance of cell status.

with the incidence of diabetes on the rise and current therapy still being inadequate in preventing disease progression, the bioartificial pancreas could well be the future of diabetes therapy with enormous potential for a cure. the in vivo differentiation potential of the heterogenous population of pancreatic progenitors derived from multipotent haecs in this present study is warranted as it could suggest their future use for cellular therapy for insulin-dependent diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS
since the presence of true pancreatic stem cells is still a matter of debate, the plasticity of other, easily available multipotent cells could be important for a cell-therapy based approach to treat insulin-dependent diabetes. we propose human amnion epithelial cells that have been engineered to over express pdx <dig>  as potential sources of pancreatic multipotent progenitors and thus as precursors for endocrine pancreas development. this process can be further potentiated with a mix of epidermal growth factor and poly-l-ornithine in the culture environment. this has important implications in the field of diabetes therapy.
