BACKGROUND
most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus and translated in the cytosol with an n-terminal transit peptide that facilitates recognition by receptors of the toc complex. in arabidopsis, two families of gtpases are responsible for preprotein recognition; the toc <dig> and toc <dig> receptors  <cit> . toc <dig> interacts with transit peptides  <cit>  at early stages of import  <cit> , suggesting that it is the primary preprotein receptor. however, it is unknown precisely how this receptor recognizes preproteins, and its function in subsequent preprotein translocation remains unclear. there are four toc159-related proteins in arabidopsis: attoc <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . these receptors are able to distinguish between semi-distinct classes of substrates; attoc <dig> is implicated in the import of photosynthetic proteins, while attoc <dig> and attoc <dig> appear to be functionally redundant, and are primarily involved in the import of non-photosynthetic proteins  <cit> . the toc <dig> receptors have three distinguishable regions: an n-terminal acidic  domain and a central gtpase  domain, which extend into the cytosol, and a c-terminal membrane  domain that anchors the protein to the outer chloroplast membrane  <cit> . the g- and m-domains of the arabidopsis family members share ~65% sequence identity  <cit> . the g-domain is involved in targeting toc <dig> to the chloroplast during initial toc complex assembly  <cit> , comprises at least part of a transit peptide binding site  <cit> , and acts as part of a gtp-regulated switch for preprotein recognition  <cit> . less information is available regarding the a- and m-domains. the a-domain is highly variable in amino acid sequence between species and among the toc <dig> family members in arabidopsis  and has no known conserved functional motifs  <cit> . although it appears to be non-essential for toc <dig> function  <cit> , the a-domain has been hypothesized to confer differential substrate recognition, owing to the variability in amino acid sequence among family members  <cit> , and evidence has recently been presented that the toc <dig> a-domain interacts with actin  <cit> . despite reports on its dispensability for toc <dig> function, the size of the a-domain  suggests that it is likely to confer some important function to the receptor.

based on hydrophobic cluster analysis of its a-domain, toc <dig> has been proposed to belong to a growing class of natively unstructured or intrinsically disordered proteins   <cit> , which show lack of globular structure over their entire length or contain large unstructured regions  <cit> , and have been estimated to account for up to ~30% of all proteins in higher eukaryotes  <cit> . several notable characteristics of the toc <dig> family a-domains are consistent with their classification as idps. they possess a high number of charged  amino acid residues, have a repetitive amino acid sequence, demonstrate aberrant mobility during sds-page and are highly sensitive to proteolysis  <cit> . in addition, idps are known to undergo extensive post-translational modification, and in particular, are enriched in phosphorylation sites  <cit> . consistent with this observation, the a-domain of toc <dig> was recently identified in a proteomic survey of phosphorylated arabidopsis proteins  <cit> .

idp domains are involved in highly dynamic protein-protein interactions  <cit> , often of high specificity and low affinity, and may interact with many different binding partners, including idp regions of other proteins. during such interactions, idps often undergo induced folding, which has been proposed to explain how they are able to achieve specific, yet low affinity interactions with multiple binding partners  <cit> . in the current study, cd spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that the a-domain of two members of the arabidopsis toc <dig> family, attoc <dig> and attoc <dig>  are idps. this represents the first investigation into the structure of the a-domains of the toc <dig> family, and has implications for future studies aimed at understanding the function of these domains, and the role of toc <dig> receptors in general, in chloroplast protein import.

RESULTS
a-domains are predicted to be natively unfolded
a recent study led to the suggestion that the a-domain of attoc <dig> may be natively unfolded  <cit> . in the current study, disorder within attoc <dig>  and attoc <dig>  was predicted using foldindex  <cit>  and iupred  <cit> . delineation of the a-domains was designated as previously described  <cit> . both programs predict the a-domains of attoc <dig> and attoc <dig>  to be mainly unfolded . the a-domains of attoc <dig>  and toc <dig> from pisum sativum   are also predicted to be largely disordered . a-domains of attoc <dig> and attoc <dig> were selected as representatives for further examination.

expression and purification of 132ahis and 159ahis
e. coli-expressed a-domains of attoc <dig> and attoc <dig> possessing n-terminal his <dig> tags  were purified using ni2+-charged resin . to gain a level of purity suitable for cd spectroscopy, the proteins were further purified by ion exchange , and the identities of the ion-exchange purified proteins were confirmed by western blotting . the theoretical molecular weights of 132ahis and 159ahis are ~ <dig> kda and ~ <dig> kda, respectively; however, these proteins migrate at an apparent molecular weight approximately  <dig> kda larger than expected during sds-page . the same phenomenon has been observed for full-length toc <dig>  <cit> ; however, when the a-domain is proteolytically degraded, the remainder of the protein  migrates as expected  <cit> . aberrant electrophoretic mobility is characteristic of acidic proteins  <cit> , and is a common property of idps  <cit> .

structural analysis of 132ahis and 159ahis using cd spectroscopy
cd spectroscopy was used to assess the secondary structure content of 132ahis and 159ahis. under non-denaturing conditions both proteins show far-uv spectra typical of unfolded proteins, characterized by the presence of a deep minimum in the vicinity of  <dig> nm and a relatively low ellipticity at ~ <dig> nm   <cit> . spectra were deconvoluted, revealing the presence of 76% and 63% random coil secondary structure in 132ahis and 159ahis, respectively . this indicates that at physiological temperature and ph, 132ahis and 159ahis are mainly disordered, supporting the hypothesis that the a-domains are idps.

adeconvolution of the far-uv cd spectra for 159ahis and 132ahis was performed using the k2d method. values represent the proportion of secondary structure composition.

effects of temperature and ph on a-domain structure
to further characterize the structural properties of the a-domains, the effects of temperature and ph on the conformation of 132ahis and 159ahis were investigated. both 132ahis and 159ahis exhibit a modest temperature-induced gain in secondary structure, as shown by an increase in negative ellipticity at ~ <dig> nm with increasing temperature . spectra deconvolution reveals that the α-helical content of 159ahis increases from 5% to 7%, and β-sheet content increases from 32% to 38% at 65°c as compared to 25°c, coinciding with a decrease in random coil content from 63% to 55% . random coil content of 132ahis also decreases from 76%  to 49% , and again, there is a concomitant gain in β-sheet content from 22% to 43%, and in α-helical content from 3% to 7% . such gains in secondary structure with increasing temperature are characteristic of idps, and are in contrast to the typical loss of structure associated with the heating of globular proteins  <cit> . in addition, both proteins gain considerable overall secondary structure at low ph . specifically, 159ahis contains 51% random coil, 8% α-helix and 41% β-sheet at ph ~ <dig>  compared to 63% random coil, 5% α-helix and 32% β-sheet at neutral ph. likewise, 132ahis contains 55% random coil, 25% α-helix and 20% β-sheet at ph ~ <dig> compared to 76% random coil, 3% α-helix and 22% β-sheet at neutral ph . these increases in secondary structure at low ph may be attributed to a decrease in net charge at a ph below their respective theoretical pi values of  <dig>   and  <dig>  . presumably, a decrease in net charge leads to a decrease in electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged residues, allowing for partial folding. an increase in structure for 132ahis at low ph can also be detected using fluorescence spectroscopy . 132ahis contains two trp residues  that fluoresce when excited at  <dig> nm . the fluorescence maximum of 132ahis shifts to a lower wavelength at ph  <dig>  suggesting that the trp residues are less exposed to solvent as a result of partial folding at low ph - a commonly observed phenomenon of acidic idps  <cit> .

trifluoroethanol induces structure of a-domains
in the presence of trifluoroethanol  both 132ahis and 159ahis show a notable increase in secondary structure from ~3-5% α-helix, 22-32% β-sheet in the absence of tfe to 28% α-helix, 28% β-sheet in 50% tfe . these results, as well as the behaviour of the proteins at temperature and ph extremes, highlight the conformational flexibility of the a-domains and indicate they have the ability to form secondary structure depending on their environment. this conformational flexibility may reflect an ability to undergo conformational changes as part of their physiological function, for example during ligand binding. several idps are noted for their ability to undergo significant conformational changes upon binding to their substrates .

interestingly, the a-domains showed differences in the amount and types of secondary structure gained at low ph and in the presence of 50% tfe. in particular, 132ahis gained more structure than 159ahis under these conditions. these differences in conformational flexibility could reflect functional differences between the a-domains of attoc <dig> and attoc <dig> 

discussion
as part of an evolutionary study into the origin of toc <dig>  it was suggested that the a-domain of attoc <dig> might be natively unfolded  <cit> . in the current study, we decided to take a structural approach to investigate this possibility in more detail, to gain insight into the function of the a-domain. we started by using disorder prediction programs that strongly predicted the a-domains of attoc <dig> and attoc <dig>  to be unstructured. in agreement with these predictions, the a-domains were shown experimentally to be disordered under non-denaturing conditions, and underwent structural changes characteristic of idps at extremes of temperature and ph. furthermore, in the presence of 50% tfe, both a-domains gained considerable structure, which together with the effects of extreme temperature and ph, shows that the proteins have the propensity to shift to a more ordered state under certain conditions, which could include association with binding partners. overall, the data presented here are consistent with the classification of the a-domains as intrinsically disordered protein domains. to date, the function of the a-domains remains largely unknown, with the exception of the recently suggested role in binding to actin filaments  <cit> , thus the identification of the toc <dig> family a-domains as idps has several potential implications for its function. in general, idps have a large surface area under physiological conditions allowing them to interact with several binding partners simultaneously  <cit> . indeed, the a-domain accounts for almost 50% of the total length of attoc <dig>  which represents a large surface area available for multiple protein-protein interactions. while binding partners of the a-domain other than actin have not yet been identified, several candidates exist. for example, the a-domain may interact with other components of the toc complex  to help facilitate complex assembly, a function previously reported for idps  <cit> . this function is reminiscent of the proposed role for the n-terminal unstructured domain of the yeast peroxisomal import receptor pex5p in stabilization of the import complex  <cit> . alternatively, the a-domain may not possess intrinsic bioactivity, but be involved in the regulation of the gtpase activity of the adjacent toc <dig> g-domain, or that of the other toc gtpase, toc33/ <dig>  modulation and/or regulation of adjacent, globular functional domains has been previously observed for n-terminally located idp regions  <cit> .

finally, perhaps the most intriguing potential function for the a-domain that emerges from the finding that it is an idp is a role in transit peptide recognition. transit peptides are variable in length  and sequence, are rich in hydroxylated amino acids, scarce in acidic amino acids, and lack a defined three-dimensional structure in aqueous solution  <cit> . it is unknown precisely how they are recognized by receptors of the toc complex; however, it has been shown that subgroups of transit peptides contain distinct motifs that affect their import efficiency and receptor specificity  <cit> . therefore, it is interesting to speculate that the disordered nature of the a-domains may facilitate interactions with multiple motifs within transit peptides, allowing for differential recognition of preproteins. the differences in structural dynamics observed between 159ahis and 132ahis in this study may be reflective of such an ability to discriminate between preproteins. in addition, it has been proposed that idps with large surface area may act in a "fly-casting" mechanism to increase the speed of low affinity protein-protein interactions  <cit> , which would allow for preproteins to be efficiently passed to downstream components of the chloroplast protein import apparatus. such transient, low affinity interactions would be consistent with the reversible, energy-independent binding of preproteins to chloroplasts at the initial stages of import  <cit> , and may also partially explain the inability to detect a-domain-preprotein interactions in vitro  <cit> , as well as discrepancies observed in the order of preprotein binding to toc <dig> and toc <dig>  <cit> . analogously, the tom <dig> receptor of the yeast mitochondrial protein import apparatus contains a disordered region that possesses multiple interaction sites for its mitochondrial protein substrates  <cit> .

while interactions between the toc <dig> family a-domains and transit peptides is an attractive mechanism for transit peptide recognition, detection of transient protein-protein interactions is technically challenging, and it is not yet clear whether the techniques employed here will be sufficient to detect potential interactions between the a-domain and transit peptides. cd may prove useful in this regard if association is accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition  <cit> ; the acquisition of α-helical structure in the presence of tfe suggests that the a-domain has a propensity to do so . techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, and nuclear magnetic resonance may also prove useful in future attempts to test whether such  interactions take place; some of these techniques have been used in studies on one of the best characterized idps, the phosphorylated kinase inducible activation domain , and others  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the a-domain represents a large portion of the toc <dig> receptors and differs significantly among members of this family. the function of this domain, however, has remained elusive. in this study, the structure of the a-domains has been investigated for the first time. the finding that the a-domains are intrinsically disordered has implications for understanding their function, and future studies on the toc <dig> receptors will be aimed at identifying a-domain binding partners to help elucidate the role of this domain in chloroplast protein import.
