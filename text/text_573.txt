BACKGROUND
the legume genus arachis is of exclusively south american origin, and contains  <dig> described species  <cit> . by far the most economically important member of this genus is peanut, arachis hypogaea. world annual production is about  <dig> million tonnes, more than 90% being grown by small farmers  <cit> . it is particularly important in africa, where production greatly exceeds that of any other legume, and in asia, where it provides more calories than soybean  <cit> .

diseases are important reducers of yield worldwide. fungal foliar diseases of peanut such as rust , web blotch  and early leaf spot  are important, but worldwide, late leaf spot  has the greatest impact. sources of resistance against these and other diseases are available in cultivated peanut genotypes, although often not in farmer preferred varieties  <cit> . wild species generally harbor greater levels of resistance and even apparent immunity, although the linkage of agronomically un-adapted wild alleles with wild disease resistance genes is inevitable.

in plant genomes disease resistance genes tend to occur in clusters. it seems likely that this distribution, which favors unequal crossing over and gene duplication and deletion, is an important factor in the evolution of the gene family and of new disease specificities  <cit> . disease resistance gene clusters can comprise substantial portions of plant genomes, and understanding resistance gene clusters helps in the understanding of the structure and evolution of a plant genome as a whole. it also has implications for breeding because knowledge of the localization of resistance gene clusters would aid in the combination of disease resistances and alleles conferring desirable agronomic characters using marker-assisted selection   <cit> .

the map used in this work is based on a cross between the two a-genome species a. duranensis krapov. & w.c. gregory and a. stenosperma krapov. & w.c. gregory, the former being the most probable a-genome donor to cultivated peanut  <cit> . the aim of using these highly polymorphic wild diploids was to provide a reference map for peanut. this high level of polymorphism means a high percentage of candidate dna markers are informative, thus facilitating the map's cross-referencing to other genetic maps. the map is based on microsatellite and legume anchor markers. microsatellites were chosen because they are based on pcr, easy to use, and co-dominant. in addition they are highly transferable within the genus arachis allowing the map to be integrated to other arachis maps including the first recently constructed linkage map for cultivated peanut  <cit> . legume anchor markers were chosen because they are transferable to other legumes and allow the alignment of this a-genome map with the maps of other crops and model legume species  <cit> . the a-genome map can thus serve as a "bridge" between, for instance, a low density map for cultivated peanut and the maps of other legumes, allowing information from different genetic maps to be accumulated.

in the present study we begin to define, on this map, the genomic regions that control disease resistance. for this, we placed candidate disease resistance genes and quantitative trait loci  for resistance against late leaf spot on the map.

methods
mapping population
the mapping population of  <dig> f <dig> plants was derived from a cross between a. duranensis accession k <dig> and a. stenosperma v <dig>  the same population used by  <cit> . dna was extracted essentially as described by  <cit> .

resistance gene analog marker development and genotyping
the nucleotide binding site domain  is found in numerous plant genes, and, to date has been exclusively associated with disease resistance. therefore regions that encode nbs domains are excellent disease resistance gene candidates, and most of our focus was on homologs of genes encoding this domain, known as rga  markers. in addition, homologs of other genes known to be involved in defense resistance as well as genes that are induced upon challenge with pathogens  <cit>  were mapped .

southern blot
nine clones representing all phylogenetic clades of nbs encoding regions described previously  <cit>  were initially tested as probes for southern hybridizations  <cit>  with dna from the parents and a limited number of f <dig> plants. probes that showed higher polymorphism and easily scorable fragments were chosen for genotyping.

scar  markers
two primer pairs that amplify specific nbs encoding regions, both sequence confirmed  <cit> , and one dominant scar marker derived from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone  identified as containing a nbs encoding region by filter hybridization with clone s1_a_ <dig>  were used for genotyping.

nbs profiling
for generation of markers derived from nbs encoding sequences we also used a modified aflp  technique known as nbs profiling. this was performed essentially as described by van der linden and coworkers   <cit> . one hundred ng of genomic dna was digested with psti and msei. adapters were ligated to the restricted fragments using the following reaction mix:  <dig> nm psti adapter,  <dig> μm msei adapter,  <dig> mm atp,  <dig>  u/μl psti and msei restriction enzymes,  <dig> u/μl t <dig> dna ligase and 1× the manufacturer's recommended reaction buffer, in a total volume of  <dig> μl. fragments were pre-amplified by pcr with  <dig> nm of each primer p <dig> and m <dig>   <dig> nm of each dntp,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  1× of manufacturer's supplied pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl of template and  <dig> u of taq dna polymerase in a  <dig> μl volume. dilutions  of these pre-amplifications were used as templates for amplification with primers designed for the kinase- <dig> motif of the nbs region of plant disease resistance genes, with varying levels of degeneracy, combined with primers designed to one of the adapters with varying numbers of selective bases . all primer sequences for nbs-profiling are described in additional file  <dig>  pcrs were performed with  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> μl of the ligation, 1× pcr buffer ,  <dig> nm of each dntp,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> and  <dig> u hotstar taq  or platinum taq dna polymerase  in a  <dig> μl volume reaction. thermocycling was as follows:  <dig> min 95°c,  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s 95°c,  <dig> min 55°c, and  <dig> min 72°c. amplification products were resolved on silver stained 4% polyacrylamide gels  <cit> . alternatively, dna was digested with the blunt-end restriction enzymes alui, haeiii or rsai. fragments were ligated to the genomewalker™ adapter  as recommended by the manufacturer and nbs <dig> and ap <dig> primers were used in pcr using the same conditions as described above.

in order to confirm that the amplification products were nbs encoding regions, fragments were excised from the gel, soaked in  <dig> μl of autoclaved deionized water overnight, and heated at 95°c for  <dig> min. a  <dig> μl aliquot was used as template for a pcr, under the same conditions as the original amplification. pcr products were sequenced on abi automated dna  <dig> or  <dig> sequencers . sequences were processed and assembled using the staden package  <cit> , with base calling performed by phred  <cit> . sequence similarities were identified using blastx against local databases of predicted arabidopsis proteins, arabidopsis resistance genes, and fabaceae proteins  <cit> . to aid in the translation of nbs encoding sequences, domains were searched using estwise  <cit> .

snp marker development and genotyping
twenty-four arachis expressed sequence tag  sequences of interest were selected for marker development. fifteen of the ests are homologs of nbs encoding sequences, eight have diverse homologies and are responsive to late leaf spot or nematode inoculation , and one is a homolog of a dehydration responsive element . primers were developed for the sequences using primer <dig> . pcr products were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining  <cit> . amplification products that showed length polymorphism between the parents of the mapping population were used directly as markers. size monomorphic products were sequenced and snps  identified using the staden package software. snp genotyping was performed using the snapshot™ single base extension method .

aflp analysis
in order to increase the number of sequence characterized markers on the map and diversify the type of markers, aflp was used  <cit> . pcr amplifications and electrophoresis were carried out as described above in nbs profiling . reactions were performed using psti and msei with  <dig> primer combinations. primer information and sequences of mapped markers are provided in aditional file  <dig> 

linkage mapping
linkage analysis was performed using all novel markers developed during this work plus the  <dig> microsatellites previously described  <cit> . the development of anchor markers and the analysis of synteny with other legumes is described elsewhere  <cit> . segregation ratios of 1:2: <dig> or 3: <dig> of all segregating markers on the  <dig> f <dig> individuals were checked using a χ <dig> test. the significance level was determined by using the false discovery rate  test at a level of  <dig>   <cit> , which allows type-i error detection. the distortion types, if zygotic or gametic, were analyzed on the distorted markers using two χ <dig> tests, according to  <cit> . linkage analysis was done using mapmaker macintosh version  <dig>   <cit> . linkage groups  were established, using a minimum lod score of  <dig>  and a maximum recombination fraction  of  <dig>  with only the co-dominant, non-distorted markers  <cit> . the lod score was then decreased to  <dig>  in order to include new markers in the groups, using two-point analysis . the new marker order within each lg was estimated by the matrix correlation method using the "first order" command. alternatively, the exact position of new markers within each group was determined by using the "try" command, which compares the maximum-likelihood of each marker order after placing markers, one by one, into every interval of the established order. marker orders were confirmed by permuting all adjacent triple orders . recombination fractions were converted into map distances in centimorgans  using the kosambi's mapping function.

bioassays
phenotyping for resistance to c. personatum was performed on the parents of the mapping population, the f <dig> hybrid, individuals composing the mapping population itself, and a. hypogaea cv. iac-tatu-st as susceptible control. the architecture of the wild derived diploid plants is not suitable for the application of standard field assays that are used on cultivated peanut, therefore a different approach was needed. bioassays were done using detached leaves. this technique relies on the ability of peanut petioles to root into moistened cotton wool in a petri-dish and thus remain alive for an extended period  <cit> . plants were maintained over multiple years by pruning and when necessary making cuttings. an isolate of c. personatum collected from peanut in a field in campinas  in the 2002/ <dig> season was maintained in oat-agar medium. to avoid the isolate being attenuated, it was passaged through a. hypogaea leaves before use in bioassays. leaves inoculated with fungal spores were maintained at 23–25°c and photoperiod of  <dig> h light and  <dig> h dark. four replicates of each individual were analyzed  <dig> days after inoculation. disease severity  was measured through the percentage of diseased leaf area . statistical analyses were performed using sigmastat . two bioassays were done, one in the 2003/ <dig> season and the other in the 2004/ <dig> season.

qtl identification
average diseased leaf area , in percentage, for the four replicates per individual in each bioassay was used for qtl mapping. the two bioassays were considered separately. qtls were mapped by using the composite interval mapping method   <cit>  in the winqtl cartographer, version  <dig>   <cit> . cim analysis was performed using model  <dig>  scanning intervals of  <dig> cm between markers and putative qtls with a window size of  <dig> cm. the genetic effects and the gene action  of significant qtl were obtained from multiple interval method  using all significant qtl from cim  <cit> . putative interactions between significant qtls were analyzed using mim. graphic presentation of the lgs and qtls was obtained by using mapchart, version  <dig>   <cit> .

analysis of synteny
ssr markers in common between arachis maps were considered as corresponding map points. some ssr markers on this a-genome map were already in common with the ssr based map of cultivated peanut  <cit> . to increase the number of shared markers, selected ssrs placed in the cultivated map that had not been screened earlier for polymorphisms in the a-genome parents were screened and, when possible, genotyped and mapped in the a-genome.

the methodology for determining synteny of the a-genome map with lotus and medicago are described in detail elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, all legume anchor markers  <cit>  and most other markers mapped in the a-genome were sequence characterized. these sequences were used in blast as queries against the lotus database from kazusa dna research institute , and against the pseudomolecules of medicago using cvit blast .

RESULTS
bioassays
the observations of diseased leaf area did not follow a normal distribution within the population, being strongly biased towards resistance to the fungus. the susceptible parent a. duranensis k <dig> had an average of  <dig> % dla , and differed significantly from the susceptible control a. hypogaea cv. tatu, with  <dig> % dla , according to tukey test, with p <  <dig> . seventy-three f <dig> plants had lower %dla than the resistant parent a. stenosperma v <dig> , of which  <dig> had no lesions .

development of markers and sequence analysis
southern blot and scar markers
all nine rga probes hybridized with both a. stenosperma v <dig> and a. duranensis k <dig>  generating polymorphic markers. four probe/enzyme combinations producing nine scorable markers were chosen for genotyping . the scar markers were easy to score, but dominant.

nbs profiling
initially a number of tests were done. amplifications performed with common taq polymerases  produced a much larger number of fragments than with the hot start taq polymerases. however, the consistency was lower and the polymorphic fragments when sequenced did not show similarity to any rga from the genbank. tests were performed varying the number of selective bases at the end of the primers. as expected, the larger the number of selective bases, the fewer fragments were produced . primers with two selective bases were mostly used, because they produced an apparently good combination of specificity, total number of fragments and number of polymorphic fragments.

twenty-four primer combinations were chosen, amplifying  <dig> fragments, of which  <dig> were polymorphic and could be genotyped. of these  <dig> fragments,  <dig> generated good quality sequences and  <dig> could be confirmed as being homologs to nbs containing genes. some of the fragments were almost identical to rgas previously isolated from arachis  <cit> . the non-rga fragments showed diverse homologies including for instance, kinases and an amylase . some pairs of fragments were deduced by sequence and genotyping data to be co-dominant, and were scored as such.

snp marker development and genotyping
two of the  <dig> amplification products from ests were size polymorphic and snps were identified in all the other  <dig> sequences, with an average of one snp per  <dig> bp. single base extensions led to easy scorable, reliable co-dominant markers. only one marker failed to genotype successfully.

aflp
standard aflp using msei with the methylation sensitive psti was used to further enrich the map with sequence characterized markers. from the  <dig> primer combinations used,  <dig> fragments could be genotyped. almost all of the mapped markers were sequence characterized and presented diverse homologies . some pairs of fragments were deduced by sequence and genotyping data to be co-dominant, and were scored as such.

linkage map
using a minimum lod score of  <dig>  and a maximum recombination fraction  of  <dig> ,  <dig> markers mapped into  <dig> lgs. these markers included  <dig> microsatellites,  <dig> legume anchor markers,  <dig> aflps,  <dig> nbs profiling,  <dig> snp, four rga-rflp and two scar markers. in total,  <dig> sequence confirmed candidate disease resistance genes were mapped,  <dig> being homologs to nbs-encoding genes and  <dig> homologs to other genes involved in plant defense, or genes induced by challenge with pathogens. lgs were numbered according to the first version of this map  <cit> . however, the inclusion of new markers resulted in  <dig> lgs instead of  <dig>  the former lgs  <dig> and  <dig> joined, and were together named lg  <dig> .

a total of  <dig>  out of the  <dig> mapped markers deviated from the expected f <dig> ratio of 1:2: <dig>  or 3: <dig>  at p <  <dig>  level. a few distorted markers were found on seven of the  <dig> lgs . in contrast, lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were basically composed of distorted markers. lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had markers with an excess of a. stenosperma alleles, while lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were distorted toward the a. duranensis alleles. lgs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed distorted markers with an excess of heterozygotes.

qtl identification
by using the permutation tests, the minimum lod scores to declare as significant the putative qtl for resistance to c. personatum were estimated as  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the 2003/ <dig> and the 2004/ <dig> trials, respectively. the reason for these high values is the non-normal distribution of the phenotypic data, which is highly skewed towards resistance, and the presence of markers with distorted segregation in some regions of the genome . therefore, we have considered a qtl with lod scores above  <dig>  as significant, as suggested by  <cit> .

four qtls were consistently identified in both bioassays, with lod scores ranging form  <dig>  to  <dig>  . these qtls were mapped on lg  <dig> , lg  <dig> , and lg  <dig>  . the qtl cp <dig> showed the highest lod in the position  <dig>  cm with the closest marker being adh8a, a homolog of nbs encoding disease resistance genes. the qtl cp <dig>  was mapped within a cluster of candidate genes, while cp <dig>  mapped between two candidate genes. qtl cp <dig> was located close to the anchor marker leg <dig>  an additional qtl was mapped only in the 2004/ <dig> trial, in lg  <dig>  close to the anchor marker leg <dig>

*markers adh8a p25m46-2/as26a are rgas

five identified qtls showed ratios of dominant to additive effects  less than  <dig> , which might be interpreted as expression additive or only partially dominant  <cit> . for all the five identified qtls, alleles from the resistant progenitor a. stenosperma increased resistance to late leaf spot. the qtl  <dig>  showed the highest additive effect in the two trials, explaining almost half of the phenotypic variance observed. the other two qtls detected close to rga markers  also showed significant additive and dominant effects in both trials. the qtl cp <dig>  which was detected only in the 2004/ <dig> trial, and cp <dig> showed minor but significant additive effects .

analysis of synteny
both lgs  <dig> and  <dig> which contained mapped clusters of candidate genes and qtls had poor or "shattered" synteny with the model legumes lotus and medicago . however, lg  <dig>  on which mapped three candidate resistance genes, showed clear syntenies with lotus and medicago, and we chose this to illustrate how the diploid map can be integrated to the map of cultivated peanut and medicago .

using shared markers, alignments between lg <dig>  lg <dig> and cultivated peanut linkage groups were possible. therefore we chose to illustrate the integration of this diploid arachis map, the map of cultivated peanut and medicago using lg <dig> .

discussion
little is known about the genomic structure of arachis and which regions control disease resistance. to the best of our knowledge in peanut, only markers linked to root-knot nematode resistance, resistance to the vector of groundnut rosette disease, rust and sclerotinia blight have been published to date  <cit> . markers linked to nematode resistance are integrated into a rflp map, which is difficult to transfer to other populations, and the markers linked to aphid resistance are in an aflp linkage map, which is sparse and difficult to transfer.

in this study we aimed to increase the information content of a previously published ssr-based arachis map, begin to define the genomic regions that confer disease resistance and perhaps reveal major resistance gene clusters. for this we used two approaches: the mapping of candidate disease resistance genes, and the mapping of qtls for resistance against one of the most important peanut diseases, late leaf spot.

for mapping candidate genes, we mainly focused on homologs of nbs domain encoding genes, and genes that respond to challenges with late leaf spot or nematodes . we used four methods for marker development and genotyping, southern blot, scar markers, nbs profiling and genotyping of snps using snapshot®. although we were successful with all of these methods, we found marker development and genotyping with snapshot® to be the most efficient, generating easy to score co-dominant markers. in total  <dig> sequence-confirmed candidate disease resistance genes were mapped,  <dig> being homologs to nbs-encoding genes.

for phenotyping we needed to use a method that was suitable for the distinct architecture of the wild diploids plants; standard field-based protocols for cultivated plants were not appropriate. therefore, we used detached leaf bioassays  <cit> , a method that measures one of the major components of late leaf spot resistance as defined for cultivated peanut. plants were maintained for multiple years by pruning, transplanting, and by taking cuttings if necessary, this allowed the performance of bioassays on the same population in different years.

for qtl analysis we used cim and mim methods. although these methods are designed for data where phenotypic variation is normally distributed, they work with non-normal distributed traits  <cit> . of the qtls identified, four of the five qtls were consistent between bioassays done in different years. all qtls had lod scores above  <dig> , well above the  <dig>  limit suggested for significance by  <cit> . in one of the trials , lod scores exceeded the minimum threshold calculated by permutation – a method that is known to overestimate significant scores for non-normal data. therefore, the support for the qtls is good, though clearly, the aim of bioassays was not to identify qtls that could immediately be used with confidence in cultivated peanut. rather the aim was to give indications of what parts of the arachis genome are involved in disease resistance, and to consider these results together with the map positions of candidate genes.

the comparison of rga map positions and qtls is striking. the markers closest linked to two of the five qtls were rgas. this strongly suggests the involvement of nbs encoding genes in the resistance response. the best known cases of nbs encoding disease resistance genes are monogenic and dominant. however, in this study the resistance seems to be polygenic and possibly partially dominant. these results are broadly consistent with previous data on the inheritance of late leaf spot resistance in cultivated peanut . the sum of the genetic effects of the qtls calculated using mim was close to 100% in both trials. although these effects are probably overestimated, they provide a good comparison between the genetic effects of each qtl and the major qtls could be identified. for the two trials, the qtl cp <dig>  showed additive effects that explained almost half of the total phenotypic variance . this qtl was located between the microsatellite markers rn5h <dig> and tc9e <dig> , close to a qtl for seed-weight . in consequence, after validation in other mapping populations, it is a good candidate for mas. two additional qtls  showed considerable additive effects that explained, together, ~30% of the variance. both qtls were located close to rga markers . the upper portion of lg  <dig>  where this qtl was mapped is rga-rich . many authors have reported close associations between rgas and disease resistance loci and qtl . therefore, such rgas can also be useful for mas of resistant genotypes. recombinant inbred lines generated from a tetraploid population {a. hypogaea × 4×} are being phenotyped for resistance/susceptibility to late leaf spot, aiming at the validation of the results obtained here.

the best characterized legume genomes are those of the model plants lotus and medicago, which thus serve as useful references for comparison with arachis. the medicago genome harbors two "super-clusters" of resistance gene analogs, one in the upper region of chromosome  <dig> and one in the lower region of chromosome 6; clusters are also present in the upper regions of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in lotus, clusters of resistance gene analogs are present on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, synteny between medicago and lotus appears to be poor in many of the genomic regions that harbor major resistance gene clusters  <cit> . therefore, it is notable that arachis a-genome lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  which harbor the most prominent clusters of candidate genes and qtls, showed shattered synteny with both lotus and medicago. it is possible that the breakage of synteny in resistance gene clusters may be due to their fast evolving nature, and their clustering with another fast evolving component of the genome, retrotransposons  <cit> . however, not all candidate disease resistance genes containing regions of this a-genome map have poor synteny, and an example of the integration of lg iii of cultivated peanut, lg  <dig> of the a-genome map and medicago chromosomes is shown in figure  <dig>  the ability to integrate different maps in this way will increase with future work and increased marker densities.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study mapped  <dig> candidate genes and five qtls for late leaf spot disease resistance. the study indicated several regions within the arachis genome as being involved in controlling disease resistance. in particular, clustering of the candidate genes and qtls suggests that the upper region of lg  <dig> and the lower region of lg  <dig> are likely to control disease resistance and to harbor clusters of disease resistance genes in arachis.
