BACKGROUND
almost all of the macromolecules in a bacterial cell, e.g. proteins, nucleic acids and cell wall components, contain nitrogen. thus, prokaryotes have developed elaborate mechanisms to provide an optimal nitrogen supply for metabolism and to overcome and survive situations of nitrogen limitation, generally summarized as nitrogen control. this communication focuses on nitrogen control in corynebacterium glutamicum, a gram-positive soil bacterium used for the industrial production of amino acids  <cit> . we have been studying nitrogen metabolism and nitrogen regulation in corynebacteria with a focus on c. glutamicum for several years  and could show that transcription of genes in response to nitrogen limitation is governed in corynebacteria, i.e. c. glutamicum, corynebacterium efficiens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, by tetr-type regulator amtr  <cit> , which blocks transcription of various genes during growth in nitrogen-rich medium. the amtr regulon of c. glutamicum was characterized by a combination of bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches. at least  <dig> genes, which encode transporters and enzymes for ammonium assimilation , creatinine  and urea metabolism , a number of biochemically uncharacterized enzymes and transport systems as well as signal transduction proteins , are directly controlled by the amtr protein in c. glutamicum  <cit> .

an amtr binding site consensus motif was deduced from bioinformatic analyses of available genome sequence information and competitive gel retardation assays  <cit> . the resulting amtr box with the nucleotide sequence tttctatn6atagat/aa  is a more or less palindromic sequence and can be located in the promoter region either on the sense or antisense strand.

in this study we address the question which amino acids within the amtr dna binding domain are in fact contacting the dna and why amtr expression is not controlled by an autoregulatory circuit as found for other tetr-type regulators 

RESULTS
characterization of the amtr binding domain reveals functionally important amino acid residues
as a molecular biology approach to identify amino acid residues of amtr involved in dna binding, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were carried out. amino acids highly conserved in the dna binding domain of tetr family proteins  were selected and exchanged against alanine, with exception of the conserved ala <dig> residue, which was changed to glycine. wild type amtr and amtr variants were purified as maltose binding protein  fusions and applied in gel retardation experiments. as target sequence a pcr fragment spanning nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> relative to the start codon of the amtb gene and comprising three amtr binding sites  <cit>  was used. while  <dig> ng of wild type amtr-mbp led to a complete retardation of  <dig>  ng of target dna, the same amount of mbp had no effect . subsequently carried out gel retardation experiments with rising amounts of amtr variants  revealed that exchange of residues glu <dig>  thr <dig>  gly <dig> and thr <dig> had no effect. the corresponding recombinant proteins behaved as wild type. a slightly reduced affinity compared to wild type amtr was observed for amtr* with exchange of his <dig> and arg <dig> to alanine and ala <dig> to glycine, while significantly reduced binding was observed for alterations of glu <dig>  leu <dig>  thr <dig>  gly <dig>  gln <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig> and leu <dig>  mutations resulting in an alanine exchange at positions phe <dig>  ile <dig>  leu <dig>  his <dig> and leu <dig> led to a complete loss of amtr* binding .

from these gel retardation assays, kd values for the binding of amtr-mbp and selected amtr*-mbp variants were estimated. the equilibrium binding constant for amtr-mbp was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m for the variant carrying the thr33ala exchange, which is in accordance with the wild type-like behaviour of this protein in the gel retardation assay. with rising effect on binding, increasing kd values were estimated, e. g.  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m for exchange glu <dig> and leu <dig>  as well as  <dig>  × 10- <dig> m for amtr*-mbp carrying the ser55ala exchange.

as an independent assay, surface plasmon resonance  measurements were carried out. in these experiments, the same amtr-mbp preparations as in the gel retardation assays were used, while the dna immobilized on the chip surface corresponded to a shorter fragment of the amtb promoter resembling only one amtr binding site . again, purified maltose binding protein was used as negative control and amtr-mbp as positive control . mbp did not bind to the immobilized dna, while addition of amtr-mbp resulted in a clearly dose-dependent increase in response units, indicating binding of the protein to its target dna. similarly, binding of amtr variants was tested . in general, results obtained with this approach were similar to that described above for the gel retardation assays. however, for exchange of thr <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> a stronger reduction of binding was observed, which might indicate a stabilization effect or cooperative binding of amtr-mbp, when more than one binding site is available.

in summary, the analysis of amtr variants generated by site-directed mutagenesis and analyzed by gel retardation experiments and spr measurements hint to a crucial role of several amino acids in dna binding. however, it was difficult to differ between direct and indirect effects. therefore, modelling experiments were carried out.

molecular modelling indicates the function of distinct amino acids
in order to allow a structural interpretation of the amtr mutation data, we started a molecular modeling approach of amtr in complex with dna based on the crystal structure of the tetr-dna complex. the significant sequence identity between the dna-binding domains of the proteins and the fact that they recognize an identical "ctat" core motif allowed the calculation of a molecular model , which provides the basis for subsequent detailed analysis.

the model shares the same characteristic structural properties previously reported for the tetr-dna crystal structure: the dna-binding domains are constituted of helices α <dig> to α <dig> of the n-terminal domains. the binding motif itself consists of the α2-α <dig> loops  organized in helix-turn-helix  motifs whereas helix  <dig> constitutes the link between the n- and c-terminal domains. each hth motif of the repressor binds to one major groove of the palindromic dna consensus nucleotide sequence "ctat". due to this twofold symmetry, subsequent bioinformatic analysis was restricted to one half-site of the complex.

the amtr-dna model complex reveals that  <dig> of the  <dig> residues investigated are in contact with the dna while the remaining  <dig> residues are located within the hth binding motif but do not directly bind dna . these two groups were termed interface  and non-interface  residues and their functions are discussed separately below. for several non-interface residues , replacement by alanine had no effect on dna binding properties. structural analysis reveals that these residues are solvent exposed and do not form crucial interactions within amtr .

the first and second column list the residues investigated and their experimentally determined effect on dna binding. "o" indicates no effect, while increasing numbers of "+ signs qualitatively reflect the magnitude, by which dna binding is decreased. signs in parenthesis indicate minor differences between the two experimental methods used. the third and fourth column list the location of the residue in the structure as deduced from the amtr-dna model as well as key structural features that might be of relevance for dna binding. "if" and "ni" denote protein-dna interface and non-interface residues, respectively. the last column shows the structurally equivalent residues in e. coli tetr.

a completely different situation is present for those non-interface residues, for which replacement by alanine leads to a complete loss of dna binding . these residues are buried within the interior of the protein and form interactions that stabilize the tertiary structure of the hth motif . the respective interactions cannot be formed by alanine in the mutant protein structures, which will lead to a disruption of the three-dimensional structure of the binding domains consequently resulting in a  loss of dna binding activity.

for the remaining group of non-interface residues , mutation results in weaker dna binding. these residues are either buried in the protein structure , or involved in the formation of a tight turn  or a salt-bridge . a replacement by alanine is therefore expected to have at least a moderate destabilizing effect for all of these sequence positions. the mechanism, by which this destabilization will reduce dna binding affinity, cannot unambiguously be determined from the static model structure. one might speculate that mutation either leads to rearrangements within amtr or that mutation might increase the portion of unfolded hth domains, which are no longer capable of dna binding. the observation that mutations can affect the disorder-order equilibrium of proteins has been recently also described for a mutation within the dna binding domain of tetr as well  <cit> .

the nine interface residues investigated can be divided into those, which have no or moderate effects on binding affinity  and those which have a strong effect . the first group of residues generally forms only weak interactions with the dna , while gln <dig>  ser <dig>  and tyr <dig> form tight contacts with the "ctat"-motif . gln <dig> for example specifically recognizes the purine ring of a <dig> via two hydrogen bonds.

a special situation is observed for residues tyr <dig> and his <dig>  which form only weak contacts with the dna, but nevertheless have a strong effect on binding affinity when mutated to alanine: tyr <dig> forms only weak interactions with the ring of a non-conserved nucleotide at promoter position - <dig> that is located adjacent to the "ctat"-motif . tyr <dig>  however, might play an additional role for stabilizing the hth motif by interaction with his <dig>  the side chain orientation of his <dig> appears to be particularly important, since this residue forms both a hydrogen bond with asn <dig> at the n-terminus of helix α <dig>  as well as a water-mediated interaction with a phosphoryl group  that was deduced in analogy to the tetr crystal structure. mutation of his <dig> to alanine might therefore affect dna binding both by direct and by indirect effects thereby explaining the strong influence of this mutation.

the lack of amtr autoregulation is caused by variations of spacing nucleotides rather than variation of the core binding motif
compared to other tetr family members, c. glutamicum amtr lacks an autoregulation circuit . neither with dna microarrays nor with real-time reverse transcriptase pcr an upregulation of amtr expression upon nitrogen starvation was detectable in different studies  <cit> , although an amtr consensus site was identified upstream of the amtr gene  <cit> . the reason for the lack of autoregulation was unclear until now, however, compared to other amtr binding sites the amtr upstream sequence differs in two points  the presence of a g instead of t at position  <dig> of the core motif and  in the number of spacing nucleotides between the two half sites,  <dig> instead of  <dig>  to investigate the importance of these differences, gel shift experiments were carried out using amtr-mbp, wild type and modified amtr promoter regions . while a g to t nucleotide exchange at position  <dig> had no significant effect, the introduction of an additional nucleotide clearly led to the binding of amtr-mbp.

discussion
tetr-type regulators are widely distributed among gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  including corynebacteria. in fact, genome sequence analyses of corynebacterium diphtheriae, corynebacterium efficiens, c. glutamicum and corynebacterium jeikeium revealed that these are the most frequently used transcriptional regulators in corynebacteria  <cit> . examples for functionally characterized members of the tetr family in c. glutamicum besides amtr are acnr, cgl <dig> and mcbr. acnr binds upstream the acn gene encoding aconitase to the putative consensus sequence cagnacnnncgtactg, which is highly conserved in corynebacterial and mycobacterial species  <cit> . cgl <dig> is a drug resistance-related regulator with significant structural similarity to the multidrug resistance-related transcription factor qacr from staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . mcbr binds to the consensus motif tagac-n6-gtcta and is involved in the regulation of sulphur metabolism and the synthesis of sulphur-containing amino acids  <cit> .

compared to the other tetr-family members in c. glutamicum, acnr  <cit>  and cgl <dig>  <cit> , the amtr regulon is relatively big and compared to especially mcbr  <cit> , the binding consensus is not very strictly conserved. this raises the questions about the similarities and differences in protein-dna recognition, especially in respect to the well-investigated e. coli tetr. for the amtr protein-dna interface, mutagenesis revealed an important role for thr <dig>  gln <dig>  ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  tyr <dig>  and his <dig>  these residues are either strictly conserved or there are only very conservative replacements observed between amtr and tetr . this finding is consistent with the fact that both repressors recognize the identical "ctat"-motif in the dna.

for the remaining three residues of the protein-dna interface  differences are observed between amtr and tetr, which might have implications for binding affinity and specificity. his <dig> is replaced by arginine in tetr. this arginine forms specific contacts with the purine ring of g <dig> in the tetr-dna crystal structure  <cit> . in the model of the amtr-dna complex, the distance between his <dig> and the purine ring is larger due to the shorter histidine side chain, suggesting a weaker interaction . although these differences might also arise from inaccuracies of our model, there are two observations which suggest a real difference between amtr and tetr. first, a replacement of his <dig> by alanine leads only to a minor decrease of binding affinity . second, the respective g-c base pair does not represent a part of the "ctat" core motif in amtr  and is non-conserved in amtr binding sequences  <cit> , while it is conserved in the "ctatc"-motif recognized by tetr. arg <dig> of amtr is replaced by glutamic acid in tetr. the presence of the non-conservative replacement together with the observation that an arginine to alanine replacement has only little effect on amtr binding affinity suggest that the arg <dig> side chain does not play a major role for the dna interaction.

another difference is observed at position 54: the respective alanine of amtr is equivalent to pro <dig> of tetr. ala  <dig> forms interactions with the methyl group of t- <dig>  these interactions, however, seem only to play a minor role for the affinity and specificity of dna recognition. this is evidenced by the observation that a replacement by glycine has only small effects on binding affinity. in addition, the contact to the methyl-group of base t- <dig> seems not to mediate a specific recognition since a replacement of thymidine by guanosine still allows an interaction . in contrast, pro <dig> of tetr contacts two thymidines of adjacent base pairs  and a replacement by glutamate was shown to have a significant effect on binding affinity and specificity  <cit> . these findings suggest that ala <dig> of amtr has a smaller role than pro <dig> in tetr for promoter recognition.

in summary, at least the differences at sequence positions  <dig> and  <dig> might explain the larger sequence variability of dna recognition by amtr compared to tetr. although amtr tolerates a certain amount of variability within the dna half-sites, their correct spacing appears to be crucial for binding. the "ctat" half-sites are separated by a five-residue spacer in tetr, but by six residues in amtr. as demonstrated by the experiment in fig.  <dig>  this spacing is essential for the amtr-dna interaction. due to the differences of the spacer length between tetr and amtr, the structural consequences of this feature on the orientation of the binding heads or the curvature of the dna cannot be deduced from the present model, but have to await the elucidation of a crystal structure of amtr in complex with dna. future work will now concentrate on the crystallization of amtr without and together with bound dna. using dna fragments with alterations of the consensus motif and the kind and number of spacing nucleotides, this approach will allow to study functional and structural flexibility of dna binding domains. furthermore, the co-crystallization of amtr with signal transduction protein glnk will provide the first structural information about an asymmetric glnk interaction complex. today, besides the interaction with amtr, which most likely acts as a dimer  <cit> , exclusively interactions with threefold symmetry were reported, e.g. of the trimeric glnk complex with trimeric ammonium transporter amtb, or with the hexameric key enzyme for arginine biosynthesis nagk  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
molecular biology and biochemistry approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis, gel retardation assays and spr are, especially in combination with molecular modelling, powerful tools to identify crucial amino acids for dna binding. in this study, we could show that besides by distinct amino acids of the tetr family protein amtr, dna binding is influenced by nucleotides not only of the conserved binding motif but also by spacing nucleotides in c. glutamicum.
