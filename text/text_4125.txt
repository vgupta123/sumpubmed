BACKGROUND
the manifestation of distinct sexes is fundamentally conserved among most metazoans. however, the development of sex-specific somatic and gonadal tissues and neuronal processes  is governed by a variety of factors both environmental and genetic, and often varying widely between and within taxa . most animals direct sex-specific cell fate by function of the doublesex/mab- <dig> related transcription factor  family of zinc-finger proteins  <cit>  and the genes they regulate. within the insects, this process involves a genetic cascade first elucidated in the model fly drosophila melanogaster  <cit>  whereby a primary signal triggers sex-specific splicing of one or more regulatory factors which subsequently bind pre-mrna of the conserved dmrt “major switch” gene, doublesex, and direct its sex-specific splicing, thus initiating development of male or female forms  <cit> .

although there are many diverse primary signals that initiate the cascade , dsx appears to be conserved as the major switch at the base of the cascade  <cit> . in many insects the male and female-specific splicing of dsx is directed by the upstream regulator transformer, a serine/arginine rich  protein which itself is transcribed in a sex-specific manner, as well as the constitutively expressed transformer- <dig>  <cit> . the resultant tra/tra <dig> peptide complex binds the dsx mrna at the dsx repeat element , facilitated by the purine-rich enhancer  element  <cit> , and directs sex-specific splicing of dsx mrna for translation into male  or female  peptides. in drosophila, an additional sr splicing enhancer component, rbp <dig>  binds to target sites in the splice acceptor preceding the female-specific exon and is essential for efficient splicing of female dsx pre-mrna  <cit> . the downstream targets of insect dsx are not well elucidated, however  <dig> optimal binding sites and associated nearest genes have been identified for d. melanogaster dmdsx  <cit> . the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum tcdsx has been implicated in oocyte development including vitellogenins and their associated receptors  <cit> , while lepidopteran dsx has been shown to influence expression of pheromone-binding proteins and hexamerin storage proteins  <cit> .

orthologs of the dsx gene have currently been identified in seven orders of insects ranging from the primitive pediculus humanus  to several genera of hymenoptera, however a functional transformer homolog has not always been recovered in these genomes  leading to speculation that some lineages have recruited alternate or additional upstream regulators for dsx  <cit> . for example, tra/tra- <dig> mediated splicing of dsx has been shown in the brachyceran flies ceratitis capitata  <cit> , musca domestica  <cit>  and lucilia cuprina  <cit>  yet transformer appears lost in the nematoceran flies including mosquitoes  <cit> .

despite varying primary signals and upstream regulatory mechanisms, male and female-specific dsx peptides of various diptera including anastrepha  <cit> , ceratitis  <cit>  and musca  <cit>  effected partial masculinization and feminization of genetically female and male d. melanogaster, respectively, when expressed ectopically. this evolutionary conservation is due in part to the retention of two functional protein domains essential for peptide oligomerization: an atypical zinc-finger dna-binding domain found in multiple members of the dmrt superfamily  and an oligomerization domain  unique to dsx  <cit> . the dbd/od <dig> domain functions to form a dimeric dna-binding unit that maintains 92 % sequence similarity between dipteran  and lepidopteran  taxa while completely conserving the critical cysteine and histidine residues  <cit> . the od <dig> domain is likely responsible for sex-specific splicing activation or repression of downstream factors  <cit> , and is modified by sex-specific splicing to maintain both common and male/female-specific portions; the common portion exhibits a greater degree of conservation within and among insect taxa than the c-terminal sex-specific portion  <cit> .

orthologs of dsx have been recovered from the mosquitoes anopheles gambiae  and aedes aegypti . both genes show sex-specific splicing and contain multiple copies of tra/tra <dig> cis-regulatory elements including dsxres and purine-rich enhancers, however they differ in several evolutionary aspects. the angdsx gene  spans an 85 kb region of chromosome 2r and is composed of seven exons, of which the first four code for 5’ utr and a common non-sex specific region of the protein. exon  <dig> is female-specific  and contains an in-frame stop codon terminating the female peptide. exon  <dig> contains male-specific coding sequence with termination codon and 3’ utr, and exon  <dig> contains only 3’utr. exons  <dig> and  <dig> are present in transcripts of both sexes but are transcribed entirely as utr in the female isoform. female-specific splicing of angdsx and the retention of exon  <dig> relies on activation of a 5’ splice donor  of the downstream intron  <dig> following binding of a tra/tra <dig> complex to dsxres which facilitates recruitment of the spliceosomal machinery. this is in contrast to doublesex genes of d. melanogaster, bactrocera tryoni, m. domestica, m. scalaris and c. capitata, which splice the female-specific isoform after activation of a weak  3’ splice acceptor upstream of the female-specific exon to facilitate its inclusion. this is evidenced by the location of the dsxre in angdsx being at the 3’ end of the female-specific exon as opposed to the 5’ end as in dmdsx.fig.  <dig> organization and splicing of d. melanogaster, an. gambiae, cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti doublesex genes. homologous exons  are aligned vertically, with numbers placed above. numbers within boxes represent the exon size, while those on a diagonal below represent intron size. yellow bars  represent stop codons. solid splice guides follow the female-specific spliceform, while dashed guides represent splicing in the male-specific form. common exons are shown in green, the female-specific exon  <dig> in dark red, and male-specific  exons in blue. the green/white stippled box adjacent to exon  <dig> denotes the extension of the reading frame to the alternate splice donor. black arrows denote tra/tra <dig> binding sites, purple arrows denote putative tra2-iss motif clusters, blue arrows signal rbp <dig> type-b motif clusters and green arrows signal nasonia-like nvtra binding site location. asterisks are placed above weak splice acceptors



the current aeadsx gene model  <cit>   spans 450 kb of genomic dna of supercontig  <dig>  and is composed of eight known exons, although nine are likely. unlike other sequenced dipteran dsx genes, aeadsx was found to produce two female-specific isoforms by exon skipping, encoding peptides with alternative c-termini via inclusion of both exons 5a and 5b, or 5b alone. additionally, analysis of cis-acting elements in aeadsx revealed a cluster of tra-2-iss and rbp <dig> elements upstream of exon 5a, and dipteran dsxre binding sites and pre elements present only in exon 5b . several instances of a motif strongly resembling a potential dsxre element previously only recovered in the hymenoptera  were found within exon and intron 5a. unlike an. gambiae  aeadsx possesses a weak splice acceptor upstream of exon 5b that is activated to splice both female isoforms. salvemini et al.  <cit>  hypothesize that regulatory mechanisms governing the sex-specific splicing of the gene in ae. aegypti are different than in other diptera including an. gambiae, and that the two female-specific exons were each under the control of a different splicing regulator: a female-specific tra-like protein acts in females as a splicing activator of exon 5b via dsxre and pre elements, while a splice repressor acts on 5a  in some transcripts. in the males, a male-specific factor may act to repress inclusion of exon 5a via tra-2-iss and nvdsxre elements, while exon 5b is excluded due to lack of female-specific tra.

cho et al.  <cit>  proposed that default female-specific dsx splicing by selective repression of the male isoform  is ancestral to holometabolous insects based on its conservation in taxa as phylogenetically distant as a. mellifera and b. mori, and that diptera possess a derived splicing system where the male form is default and the female form must be ‘splice-activated’ by a tra/tra2-like factor. while this appears to be the case in anastrepha, drosophila, and an. gambiae doublesex, the data from salvemini et al.  <cit>  strongly suggest that the female spliceforms are default in ae. aegypti; the “strong” exon 5a does not require tra/tra <dig> enhancement, and must be repressed by a male factor. culicine mosquitoes  determine sex at an autosomal locus  <cit> , while anopheline mosquitoes possess heteromorphic  sex chromosomes  <cit> . the latter authors propose that this locus  may either act on intermediary factors or on the dsx gene itself  to suppress female-specific dsx splicing and generate the male form. further, salvemini et al.  <cit>  posit that retention of the hymenopteran-like nvdsxre elements coupled with apis-like splicing regulation  could represent a stably maintained ancestral state in ae. aegypti exclusive of the rest of known dipteran doublesex. recently, analysis of the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum  <cit>  revealed three female-specific and one male-specific dsx isoform, with male default splicing occurring via suppression of maternally transferred zygotic tra protein  by a dominant male factor. this variation in the top-level regulation of dsx among hymenoptera, diptera, lepidoptera, and coleoptera via upstream factors is in agreement with the theory of wilkins  <cit>  stating that the cascade has evolved in reverse order, with the final double-switch gene  remaining relatively conserved as additional elements are added and/or neofunctionalization occurs at the upper regulatory levels. as sex determination is critical to insect reproduction, deleterious mutations in dsx could therefore have strong effects on fitness and be selected against. previous studies have shown the female-specific exon to be evolutionarily conserved , yet disagree on evolutionary rate comparisons of the common and male-specific portions of the transcript over longer evolutionary time frames. hughes  <cit>  found a much greater rate of non-synonymous substitutions within the male-specific region as compared to the common region, while sobrinho jr. and de brito  <cit>  found nearly equivalent levels of positive selection between the two.

as the production of genetic sexing mosquito strains and molecular methods that create male bias and/or elimination of the female sex are ideal strategies for sterile insect technique  <cit> , it follows that a conserved sex regulator like doublesex  would be optimal molecular targets for such control programs  <cit> . elucidating the variable mechanisms by which dsx determines sexual fate in sequenced mosquito lineages is mandatory if progress is to be made towards a control strategy for the world’s deadliest animals. here we provide full-length gene sequence, sex-specific splicing analyses, and regulatory analysis of the doublesex gene from the southern house mosquito culex quinquefasciatus  via rt-pcr and illumina transcriptome data. additionally, to discern the strength and location of early evolutionary drivers on doublesex within the culex pipiens complex, we conduct an evolutionary analysis using cxqdsx and a newly constructed dsx transcript from culex pipiens form pipiens . these results provide a comparative platform with which to study sex determination in those mosquitoes with currently sequenced genomes .

methods
we used the conserved od <dig> and od <dig> peptide sequences of the aedes aegypti doublesex gene  <cit>  as a tblastn query to the cx. quinquefasciatus genome assembly  <cit>  and identified strong hits to both on genome supercontig  <dig> . further blast searches using the full peptide sequence of aeadsx identified very weak local alignments to the supercontig representing putative female-specific  and male specific/utr  coding sequence. a putative start codon in exon  <dig> was identified via homology with aeadsx, and primers quinqod12f, quinqod12rcom and quinqod12rfem  were designed to amplify the putative 5’ end of the common and female specific transcripts, respectively, and primers quinqdsx8f, quinqdsx7f, quinqdsx6r and quinqdsx7r were designed to amplify the 3’ end of male and female specific transcripts.fig.  <dig> location of cxqdsx rt-pcr primers . common exons are shown in green, the female-specific exon  <dig> in dark red, and male-specific  exons in blue. the exon4ex extension is represented with a green/white hatched box. the dbd/od <dig> domain is indicated with a yellow box and od <dig> with an orange box. red triangles denote stop codons



culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were obtained from a colony initiated in  <dig> with egg rafts collected from oahu, hawaii, usa. male and female total rna was extracted separately from twenty adult mosquitoes of each sex using the qiagen rneasy plus universal kit  per manufacturer’s protocol. prior to extraction, samples were placed in a 2 ml eppendorf tube containing a sterile steel bead + 800 μl qiazol solution and homogenized for 1 min @ 20hz on a qiagen tissuelyser. contaminant dna was removed with the turbo dna-free dna removal kit  and first-strand cdna was generated using the superscript first-strand synthesis system  per manufacturer’s protocol and diluted to 50 μl in h2o. four microliters of the cdna was used in each 25 μl pcr reaction containing 12 μl h2o,  <dig>  μl qiagen q-solution,  <dig>  μl 10× pcr buffer,  <dig>  μl dntps,  <dig>  units amplitaq dna polymerase  and  <dig>  μl  of each primer. thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min @ 95 °c, followed by 30 cycles x , 5 min @ 68 °c final extension.

to recover the complete 5’ end of the transcript, we performed 5’ race pcr using the firstchoice rlm-race kit  per manufacturer’s protocol using internal gene-specific primers quinqdsx5race-gsp <dig> and quinqdsx5race-gsp <dig> placed adjacent to the od <dig> domain. all rt-pcr and race-pcr amplicon products were visualized on a  <dig>  % agarose gel in tae buffer and gel-purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit  prior to cloning via the topo ta cloning kit  and pcr-enrichment using the m <dig> forward/reverse primer pair per manufacturer’s protocol. pcr products were cleaned with exosap  per manufacturer’s protocol, and cycle sequencing was performed by genewiz  using the m <dig> primer pair.

the 3’ end of cxqdsx was predicted, and the entire gene sequence qualified by mapping the paired-end rnaseq data from ncbi sra accession srr <dig> generated by leal et al.  <cit>  to cx. quinquefasciatus supercontig  <dig>  using the clc genomics workbench  large-gap read mapper  and manually examining the output. this process was repeated using the cx. pipiens f. pipiens paired-end rnaseq library generated by  <cit>   and the cx. quinquefasciatus reference generated above to create the full-length gene structure for cx. pipiens f. pipiens doublesex . to extend the gene model for aeadsx, we repeated this protocol yet again with the ae. aegypti ncbi short-read paired-end libraries srr <dig> and srr <dig> and aaegl <dig>  supercontig  <dig> .

to assess the distribution of the consensus dsxre  and rbp <dig> type-b motifs , we screened all transcript coding  sequences corresponding with the cx. quinquefasciatus cpip <dig>  dataset from vectorbase for their presence. the degenerate motif was broken down into all possible constituents, and each was queried against the cds dataset with blastn . the output was parsed via custom perl scripts, and transcripts containing six copies of the motif in a 224 bp  window were retained. the ahopro software utility  <cit>  was used to calculate the probability of observing the motif against a reference dataset of nucleotides randomly generated under a bernoulli/0-order markov model.

the synonymous substitutions per synonymous site and nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site  and the ka/ks ratio were calculated in a pairwise comparison between cxqdsx and cxpipdsx using the kaks calculator v <dig>   <cit>  under model averaging . we re-calculated these values for each sliding 30 bp window while moving 3 bp  downstream at a time. to examine base composition of splice acceptor sites, we retrieved  <dig>  internal  exons with 16 nt of upstream sequence from the cpipj  <dig>  assembly  and calculated the mean number of pyrimidines in the 12 nt preceding the 4 nt splice acceptor.

RESULTS
structure and splicing of cxqdsx
tblastn identified strong alignments to both aeadsx od <dig> and od <dig> domains on cx. quinquefasciatus supercontig  <dig> . further homology searches via tblastn  identified putative local alignments to both the common , female specific  and male-specific  cds sequence on that same contig. the primer pair quinqod12f/quinqod12r , designed to amplify the common regions of the od <dig> and od <dig> domains, produced a double-band in both male and female cx. quinquefasciatus cdna. sequencing and genome alignment revealed this was due to the presence of a 75 bp  alternatively spliced in-frame intronic sequence within exon  <dig> that was present in some transcripts but spliced out of others . an equivalent 63 bp  tract was reported from aeadsx and a 72 bp  tract reported in angdsx  <cit> , however this appears to be specific to the culicidae and has not been reported from sequenced dsx transcripts in other taxa. the conservation and evolution of this splicing event within the mosquitoes is evidence of an as yet undetermined functional role. both male and female n-termini of the cxqdsx gene contained two small 45 bp exons homologous to exons 3a and 3b of aeadsx . the primer pair quinqod12f/quinqod12rfem, designed to amplify the putative female-specific transcript by binding the 3’ end of the od <dig> domain in exon  <dig>  generated product only in female cdna  thus confirming the sex-specific splicing of the mrna and the location of the female-specific exon. by using a forward primer located downstream of the in-frame intron in exon  <dig>  and reverse primer within the putative male-specific/common exon  <dig> , we generated an amplicon spanning a ca.  <dig>  bp exon  specific to the female that was spliced to exon  <dig> after removal of  <dig>  kb of intronic sequence . we find no evidence for an alternative female spliceform involving a second female-specific exon as is present in aeadsx  <cit> , indicating that the phenomenon is likely an intron gain in aedes rather than a loss in anopheles. the male rt-pcr product lacked this exon, and consisted of a smaller amplicon splicing exons  <dig> and  <dig> . both males and females shared the c-terminal male-specific/common exon  <dig>  as in angdsx and aeadsx.fig.  <dig> peptide alignment of d. melanogaster, an. gambiae, cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti doublesex genes; divided into  <dig>  common region ,  <dig>  female-specific region  <dig> ,  <dig>  female-specific peptide c-terminus generated by use of alternate exon  <dig> splice donor, and  <dig>  male-specific region . ncbi identification numbers are appended to the sequence id. the in-frame intronic sequence is in bold/underline. the dna-binding oligomerization domain  is boxed in yellow, while the common and female-specific portions of od <dig> are boxed in orange

5’ race-pcr, after final amplification with primer dsx-5racegsp <dig>  produced an identical ca. 1400 bp amplicon from both male and female cdna  that extends exon  <dig> of the transcript 451 bp upstream of the start codon, meets  <dig>  bp of intronic sequence, and is spliced to an 856 bp exon 1/utr . the transcription start site  falls on the adenine nucleotide of an initiator  sequence yyanwy  with a putative downstream promoter element  motif rgwy at position + <dig>  no tata box was found. pending functional validation, this region may thus represent a cxqdsx promoter.fig.  <dig> pairwise nucleotide alignment of putative doublesex promoter regions of culex quinquefasciatus  and aedes aegypti . initiator box  and downstream promoter element  are boxed in yellow. the transcription start site  at position + <dig> and dpe at position + <dig> are marked. exon  <dig>  is outlined in black. the sequence logo plot below the alignment illustrates conservation



to qualify our cxqdsx gene model, we mapped the short-read illumina rnaseq data in ncbi sra accession srr <dig> generated by leal et al.  <cit>  to supercontig  <dig>  and manually annotated cxqdsx. the transcript was well represented in these data, and the structure congrued with our rt-pcr and 5’race results in the placement and splicing of all previously described exons including the lack of additional spliceforms in female-specific exon  <dig> as well as the sequenced 5’ common end of exon  <dig>  additionally, these data allowed us to define the c-terminus of cxqdsx, including the full  <dig>  bp male-specific/common exon  <dig> and its splicing over  <dig>  bp of intron to a terminal  <dig>  bp 7th exon/utr . the final cxqdsx protein product  initiates translation in both females and males from the start codon in the common exon  <dig>  and terminates in female mosquitoes at the opal-ochre double stop codons  within exon  <dig> and in male mosquitoes at a stop codon within exon  <dig>  exons  <dig> and  <dig> are thus transcribed entirely as utr in the female isoform, as has been shown in other dipterans including megaselia scalaris  <cit> , anopheles gambiae  <cit>  and aedes aegypti  <cit> .

the rnaseq mapping revealed an additional alternative splicing event that was not reflected in our rt-pcr experiments; a 160 bp extension of exon  <dig>  resulting in use of an alternate downstream splice donor  to the female-specific exon  <dig> acceptor. the putative peptide from this mrna terminates within the extension at a double stop  codon 89 bp from the previously recognized splice donor site and encodes  <dig> amino acids. this is the same number of amino acids encoded by the orf within exon  <dig>  thus both splice forms produce peptides of equivalent length . of the  <dig> reads in the library splicing exons  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  splice exon  <dig> from the extension and  <dig>  from the canonical position. our rt-pcr using male cdna and primers quinqod12f/dsx6r produced only the expected double-band  at 950 bp, while the female reaction using primers dsx8f  and dsx6r produced the single band mentioned previously . to address the possibility that we failed to detect a second amplicon in the latter reaction, we performed a follow-up rt-pcr on female cdna with primers quinqod12f/quinqod12rf; this generated four bands  at sizes commensurate with those generated by removal of the exon  <dig> extension and/or the exon  <dig> in-frame intron . to confirm the occurrence of the transcript variant and its restriction to female cdna, we next searched illumina rnaseq libraries prepared from cx. pipiens f. pipiens and f. molestus, and cx. pipiens pallens mosquitoes of mixed sex and life stages  <cit>  see additional file  <dig> for details and accession numbers) for presence of the exon4ex donor and for male-specific splicing of the exon  <dig> extension to exon  <dig>  we found  <dig> amplicons  that spliced the extension to the female-specific exon  <dig>  and  <dig>  from the canonical position . these numbers are nearly identical to those from cx. quinquefasciatus, yet none were spliced to exon  <dig>  this is evidence that the alternate isoform is likely specific to the female and comprises roughly 28 % of female dsx isoforms in the mosquitoes studied. additionally, the alternate splice donor appears to be conserved within the cx. pipiens complex. the final cxqdsx gene  is composed of eight exons and spans  <dig>  bp of supercontig  <dig> .fig.  <dig> female rt-pcr prodcuts. rt-pcr products derived from amplification of female cdna with primers quinqod12f/quinqod12rfem illustrating the four female-specific amplicons obtained by splicing of the exon  <dig> extension and/or the exon  <dig> in-frame intron 



completing the aeadsx gene
to compare the size, structure, intron characteristics and putative promoter regions of our full-length gene model with that of the other sequenced culicine mosquito, ae. aegypti, we used publicly available illumina short-read rnaseq data to discern in-silico the 5’utr, transcription start site, exon  <dig> and full 3’utr of aeadsx  <cit> . to predict the 5’ end of aeadsx, we mapped illumina short-read rnaseq libraries from ncbi sra accession srr <dig> to aedes aegypti strain liverpool supercontig  <dig>  as performed previously and located exon  <dig> defined by salvemini et al.  <cit> . by visual inspection of the mapping, we were able to extend the 2nd exon 472 bp upstream of the start codon, define a splice junction spanning  <dig>  bp of intronic sequence, and locate a  <dig>  bp 1st exon/5’utr . as rnaseq mapping provides only approximate definition of transcript ends, we searched for a promoter motif within an area +/− 250 bp from the point at which 5’ short-read coverage for exon  <dig> ceased. we located an initiator element  of the form yyanwyy at position  <dig> of the reverse-complemented supercontig  <dig>  and a downstream promoter element  of the form rgwyv at canonical position + <dig> from the inr adenine , thus providing strong evidence for the aeadsx transcription start site. as in cxqdsx, no tata box was found.

these transcriptome data disagree slightly with the c-terminus of the currently described aeadsx transcript  in that we find  <dig>  bp of intronic sequence between exon  <dig> and the terminal/utr exon  <dig> as opposed to the  <dig>  bp reported, and our data support a very large  <dig>  bp 7th exon  as opposed to the reported 449 bp . additionally, we find the upstream splice acceptor to female-specific exon 5b to use canonical gt/ag splicing  as opposed to the suboptimal gt/gt splicing reported. this does not change the comparatively high number of purines in the polypyrimidine tract or the status of exon 5b as weak . the final aeadsx gene model  spanned  <dig>  bp of supercontig  <dig> .table  <dig> splice donors and acceptors of the cxqdsx gene. coding  sequences are in uppercase text, while the splice donor/acceptor and succeeding/preceeding  <dig> nucleotides, respectively, are in lowercase. “exon 4ex” denotes the alternate downstream splice donor of exon  <dig>  asterisk indicates the splice acceptor site deviates significantly from the genomic mean of  <dig>  +/−  <dig>  se

repetitive elements
the genera aedes and culex are estimated to have diverged ca.  <dig> mya  <cit> . the genome size for cx. quinquefasciatus currently stands at 540mbp  <cit> , while that of ae. aegypti is estimated to be over twice that size at  <dig> gbp, largely due to the accumulation of transposable elements   <cit> . as tes are not distributed randomly within chromosomes  <cit> , we assessed the frequency of repetitive elements within the doublesex gene in order to determine whether different classes have invaded the respective dsx genes of cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti. we used censor  to scan cxqdsx introns 2– <dig> and compared the results to those for aeadsx intron 2– <dig>  <cit>  . the two genes contain nearly identical numbers of dna transposons and similar numbers of ltr retrotransposons, however aeadsx was found to contain nearly twice as many non-ltr retrotransposons . these elements persist with great success in eukaryote genomes  <cit>  and comprise 4 % and 14 % of the transposable elements in the cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti genomes, respectively  <cit> , thus their abundance in doublesex likely reflects the genome-wide pattern.

regulatory mechanisms of cxqdsx
all splice junctions of cxqdsx use conserved gt-ag splice donor/acceptor motifs . interestingly, we find that the number of purines in the polypyrimidine tract of the 3’ splice acceptor preceding the common/male-specific exon  <dig>  deviates significantly from the calculated mean  and constitutes a suboptimal splice acceptor. this is contrary to aeadsx, which is hypothesized to activate a weak splice acceptor upstream of the female-specific exon 5b  <cit> , and angdsx which likely relies on activation of the 5’ weak splice donor downstream of exon  <dig>  <cit> .

to define putative regulatory mechanisms which may govern the sex-specific splicing of the female-specific exon  <dig> and/or the enhancement of the weak 3’ splice acceptor preceding the male-specific exon  <dig>  we searched intron  <dig>  exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and exon  <dig>  for putative cis-acting elements derived from consensus alignments of d. melanogaster, an. gambiae  and ae. aegypti tra/tra <dig> binding sites , the nasonia vitripennis tra/tra <dig> binding site , the rbp <dig> type a and b motifs  and the tra-2-iss motif . six copies of the tra/tra <dig> motif  were found within a 224 bp stretch at the 3’ end of the female-specific exon  <dig>  three copies exhibit strong similarity  to the d. melanogaster tra/tra <dig> sequence at the nucleotide level, while the remaining three deviated from d. melanogaster  yet adhered to the consensus motif. other dipterans including drosophila maintain six copies of the dsxre to facilitate recruitment of splice factors to the female-specific splice site  <cit> . their presence may thus be evidence for a functional significance in cxqdsx splicing, and the action of a tra-like factor in splicing cxqdsx pre-mrna. to assess the significance of this cluster, we searched the cx. quinquefasciatus transcriptome for additional windows of 224 bp containing six copies of the consensus motif. two genes , cpij <dig>  and cpij <dig>  met this criterion. both genes are currently annotated as 'hypothetical proteins' in vectorbase and maintain little homology to other peptides in the ncbi nr database . a single gene  contained  <dig> copies in 224 bp, while none remaining contained more than three. additionally, we used the ahopro software of boeva et al.  <cit>  to determine the probability of observing six copies of the motif in  <dig>  bp  to be  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  the probability of observing six copies in 224 bp is  <dig> x10− <dig>  six putative purine-rich elements  were identified, three of which were in the canonical position within exon  <dig> near the tra/tra <dig> binding sites, however two copies were found in intron  <dig> and one in intron  <dig>  the function, if any, of the latter three elements currently remains unclear. movement of the tra/tra <dig> enhancer sites  downstream to the distal splice donor of the female-specific exon  appears to be conserved in the mosquitoes, however the exact effect of this placement on splicing to create the female isoform remains unknown. in drosophila, they activate the splice acceptor of the female-specific exon  <cit> , and are hypothesized to do the same to exon 5b of aeadsx  <cit> ; in anopheles, they appear to activate the splice donor immediately downstream of the female-specific exon  <cit>  .fig.  <dig>

twenty-two copies of an rbp <dig> type b motif were present; fourteen copies were located outside of exon  <dig>  however these were represented by eleven different permutations of the consensus sequence. each 7 nt permutation had a blastn e-value of  <dig>  when queried against the full cxqdsx gene sequence, and  can be expected to occur at least once by chance. eight copies, however, were clustered in a 546 bp stretch at the 5’ end of the male-specific exon  <dig>  repeating the protocol used in the tra/tra2-like enrichment test above, we find  <dig> of  <dig>  transcripts  contain  <dig> or more copies of the rbp1b consensus in a 546 bp window. many of these contigs generated positive results due to tandem repeats however . using ahopro  <cit> , we determined the probability of observing this motif in 546 bp of randomly-generated sequence data to be  <dig> x10− <dig>  a cluster of rbp <dig> binding sites and tra-2-iss elements upstream of the “strong” female-specific exon 5a of aeadsx are hypothesized to manage the differential splicing of this exon while other tra/tra2-like elements enhance the “weak” exon 5b  <cit>  . the localization of this rbp1-binding cluster near the “weak” or suboptimal splice acceptor in cxqdsx exon  <dig> indicates a sr-like factor may be involved in its splicing. this presents a curious model, as exon  <dig> is included in both male and female spliceforms. it is thus likely that if exon  <dig> requires activation by a sr-like factor, it would occur in the male-specific spliceform and facilitate excision of the female-specific exon  <dig>  this would require use of the exon  <dig> splice acceptor at the expense of exon  <dig>  and could be facilitated by the rbp <dig> elements. the functional tra/tra2-like factor present in the female would then suffice to maintain incorporation of exon  <dig> as utr. five copies of the tra-2-iss motif were found but were not in significant representation. three copies of the nvtra element were found, however unlike in aeadsx that maintains four copies within a cluster in exon  <dig>  two copies were found in intron  <dig> and one in exon  <dig>  the blastn e-value of each 8 bp hit within the search area was  <dig> , thus we cannot exclude this result as having occurred simply by chance.

sequence evolution of cxqdsx
assembling the complete doublesex transcript from two members of the culex pipiens complex  allowed us to examine the rate of peptide evolution within this integral gene between closely related mosquito species. using a sliding window approach along a pairwise codon alignment of the male and female doublesex isoforms  we graphed the ka/ks values along the gene length. the female isoform alignment, inclusive of the common od <dig> and od <dig> domains, was devoid of non-synonymous substitutions and thus both ka and ka/ks indicated only purifying selection. the male isoform however exhibited elevated ka and ks values along the majority of the male-specific c-terminus of the peptide, with ω reaching maximal values in several locations . these results indicate that particular regions of the isoform may be under positive selection. the 5' end of the male-specific region has been shown to exhibit signs of positive selection in the anastrepha fraterculus species group  <cit> , however unlike anastrepha, we find significantly higher levels of peptide evolution  and potential positively selected sites  in the male-specific doublesex transcript as compared to the female-specific and common regions in these closely related mosquitoes. hughes  <cit>  proposed a mechanism for this observation based on the fact that 1) doublesex influences not only development of insect genitalia but also of morphological and behavioral secondary sex characteristics  and 2) these secondary traits are commonly exaggerated and diverge rapidly during sexual selection in response to female choice  <cit> . if female choice itself were a product of neutral mutation  <cit> , the pleiotropic repercussions of evolving linked male characters in response could create “runaway” evolutionary pressures on the male-specific dsx protein and result in the ka and ka/ks patterns witnessed in our data.fig.  <dig> ka/ks graph. graphical representation of ka , ks  and ka/ks  values calculated for male-specific cx. quinquefasciatus / cx. pipiens form pipiens doublesex pairwise codon alignment. values are recalculated for each  <dig> nucleotide  window, which slides 3 nt  at a time. numbers on the x-axis denote the coordinate of the central nucleotide in the window. ka/ks values were truncated at a maximal value of six for display purposes. the common portion of the transcript ends and male-specific sequence begins with the window centered at nucleotide position 735



CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the cx. quinquefasciatus doublesex gene exhibits sex-specific splicing, as it does in the mosquitoes ae. aegypti and an. gambie, as well as in other diptera. cxqdsx shares characteristics of both aeadsx  and angdsx , as well as a novel spliceform generated from an alternate exon  <dig> splice donor that appears to occur only in the female. additionally, we complete the full-length aeadsx model and identity a putative tata-less inr/dpe core promoter region in both cx. quinquefasciatus and ae. aegypti mosquito genomes, allowing for future in situ validation and studies of dsx gene transcription.

we find that cis-regulatory splicing regulation of cxqdsx does not appear to follow either currently described mosquito model, and instead involves activation of a weak splice acceptor of the male-specific/common exon  <dig>  possibly involving a cluster of local rbp <dig> binding sites as enhancers. this finding further exemplifies the diversity present in upstream splicing regulation of dsx within mosquitoes, as each of the three genera studied  possess unique regulatory mechanisms despite maintaining tra/tra2-like binding sites in the 3’ end of their respective female-specific exons .

an analysis of peptide evolutionary rates between cxqdsx and the dsx gene of the closely related cx. pipiens form pipiens  shows that the male-specific component of the transcript has evolved at accelerated evolutionary rates relative to the female isoform, and contains sites exhibiting signs of positive selection. this result accentuates the rapid evolution of doublesex within the culex species complex. future research defining the degree to which doublesex influences the sexual selection cycle may shed light on the role  that this integral gene plays in incipient speciation within insects.
