BACKGROUND
feline panleukopenia virus  and canine parvovirus  both belong to the protoparvovirus genus within the parvovirinae subfamily of the parvoviridae family of single-stranded dna viruses  <cit> . cpv- <dig> and  <dig> infect canidae and cpv- <dig> emerged as a new host range variant in the mid-1970s  and spread worldwide in the canine population in  <dig>  <cit> . then, antigenic variants cpv-2a, b, c have gained infectivity for other species such as cats. fpv and fpv-like strains  are unable to infect canidae  <cit> . although most fpv and cpv strains have been isolated from cats and dogs, a broad range of alternative hosts have been identified within the carnivora order  <cit> .

parvovirus genome replication takes place in the nucleus and requires cells in s phase, since it relies on host cell machinery for the formation of double-stranded replication intermediates  <cit> . this requirement limits the tropism of fpv and cpv to highly dividing cells such as those found in the intestine, bone marrow or lymphoid tissues. in kittens during the perinatal period, the infection of neuroblasts of the external granular layer is thought to be responsible for the cerebellar hypoplasia typically associated with such infections. however, viral proteins are expressed in some purkinje cells despite the fact that these neurons are post-mitotic at this development stage  <cit> . nervous tissue infection by fpv has never been described in adult cats, although positive cpv immunostaining of feline cerebral neurons has been reported  <cit> , which raises questions about the possible re-entry of some neurons into the s phase of the cell cycle, making them susceptible to infection.

in the present study, we show strong evidence of infection of cerebral neurons by fpv in young and adult cats, some of which with a history of neurological signs, associated with a unique mutation in the ns <dig>  amino acid sequence. besides, one affected cat showed a co-infection by feline bocavirus type  <dig>  which is the first evidence of nervous system infection by a bocavirus.

RESULTS
twenty eight parvovirus-positive cats, aged from 6 weeks to 5 years  were investigated in this study. real time pcr revealed the presence of parvovirus dna in most organs tested, with the highest concentrations in the spleen, small intestine and mesenteric lymph node  for these three organs:  <dig>  +/−  <dig> ). interestingly, brain tissues were positive for most cats, with relatively low ct values  in several of them . especially, the differences in ct value between brain tissues and the ileum  were highly variable, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this difference was the lowest  in cats no  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  several of these cats were reported by referring veterinarians to have shown neurological disorders before death, mostly ataxia and/or dysphagia.table  <dig> details of the  <dig> fpv-positive cats included in the study

affected cats were characterized on gross examination by mild to severe fibrinous to fibrinomucoid enteritis with thickened mucosa and highlighted peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymphadenomegaly.

the histopathological analyses showed classical lymphocyte necrosis and depletion in lymphoid organs  and severe intestinal villous blunting. intestinal crypt cells were necrotic. intestinal villi were depleted of their enterocytes and covered with a thick fibrinonecrotic exudate. focal neuronal satellitosis and neuronophagic pictures  were observed in the brain of cats no  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . none of the cats, even the youngest, showed any evidence of cerebellar atrophy.fig.  <dig> histopathological features of brain sections  from a 12-week-old parvovirus-infected cat presented in this study . satellitosis around neurons with condensed chromatine  is observed



immunohistochemical  staining of the different sampled organs revealed the presence of parvoviral antigens in most locations. in particular, a bright staining was observed in cells from ileal crypts and follicular dendritic cells in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. staining was negative in the cerebellum but  <dig> cats  showed strong positivity for parvoviral antigens in other brain regions, especially the interthalamic adhesion of the diencephalon . glial cells  but also neurons  showed bright cytoplasmic staining. infection was associated in some but not all infected neurons by signs of neuronal degeneration and glial reaction . the four cats bearing infected neurons were 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks and  <dig>  years-old . further immunostaining of the brain from cat number  <dig> for p27kip <dig> antigen revealed an absence of nuclear p27kip <dig> expression in fpv-infected neurons, while it was clearly expressed in the nucleus of uninfected neurons . a relatively strong background reaction could not be avoided with the antibody dilution  necessary to obtain a frank nuclear staining in p27kip <dig> positive cells .fig.  <dig> immunohistochemical staining for fpv antigens in parvovirus-positive cat brains. a to d intense cytoplasmic or nuclear immunostaining of purkinje cells from an infected kitten cerebellum used as a positive control . e to j bright staining of neuronal bodies and processes and  several microglial cells in the diencephalon  from a 12-week-old cat presented in this study  original magnification x200)

the full genome of the parvovirus present in the brain of the cat with the strongest ihc staining  was obtained using next-generation sequencing . sequence analysis allowed its classification as a feline panleukopenia virus, which was confirmed by a phylogenetic analysis  and a sequence identity matrix  based on the vp <dig> nucleotide coding sequence. a unique l → s substitution was observed at position  <dig> in the amino acid sequence of the ns <dig> protein , resulting from a t → c nucleotide substitution at position  <dig> of the ns <dig> coding sequence. further sequence comparisons confirmed that this substitution had never been observed in fpv and cpv sequences available in genbank to date. sequences of vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins were typical of fpv .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the kp <dig> fpv strain based on vp <dig> nucleotide coding sequence. representative strains of canine parvovirus , feline panleukopenia virus  and mink enteritis virus  are included. statistical support of  <dig> parallel maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates  is indicated at the nodes. taxon information includes genbank accession number, name/antigenic variant and strain. the feline parvovirus strain generated in this study is bolded and underlined. the scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site

a pcr targeting the region of interest of ns <dig> coding sequence confirmed the unique substitution in the kp <dig> strain. the same pcr was applied to dna extracted from the other three cats  with neuronal ihc staining and revealed the presence of the same substitution . subsequent next-generation sequencing of the full genome of the fpv genome from two of these cats  showed an identical amino acid sequence of ns <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> to that of kp <dig> strain . the ns <dig> substitution was not found in intestinal fpv strains infecting three cats with a negative cerebral immunostaining . it has to be noted here that these three cats had a positive fpv pcr in brain tissues, but with high ct values, especially when compared to ct values in the ileum.

further analysis of the sequencing data from the cat brain infected by kp <dig> fpv showed the presence of feline bocavirus. subsequent pcr amplification with specific primers allowed the sequencing of around 80 % of the full genome . phylogenetic analysis based on the available partial genome allowed classification of this strain as a type  <dig> feline bocavirus .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of feline bocavirus strain kp <dig> based on partial genomic sequence. currently available type  <dig> and type  <dig> feline bocavirus strains are included. a partial genome  was used for analysis. statistical support of  <dig> parallel maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates  is indicated at the nodes. fpv strain  <dig>  is used as outgroup. taxon information includes genbank accession number, name/antigenic variant and strain. the feline bocavirus strain generated in this study is bolded and underlined. the scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site



discussion
feline panleukopenia virus has long been known to cause cerebellar hypoplasia in neonatal kittens through in utero or perinatal infection of the external germinal epithelium of the cerebellum  <cit> . parvoviruses typically target highly mitotic cells such as those from intestinal crypts, bone marrow and lymphoid tissues  <cit> . this requirement explains why cerebellar hypoplasia is only observed in kittens infected perinatally or in utero and not in older cats. cell cycle re-entry might be involved in the productive infection of purkinje cells in kittens  <cit> .

extra-cerebellar lesions of the central nervous system associated with parvoviral infections were described in cats with demyelination of the spinal cord  <cit>  and in cats with canine parvovirus replication in cerebral neurons  <cit> . such productive infections of cat cerebral neurons were strikingly associated with old cpv- <dig> strains, which seem to infect cats while they do not circulate in dog populations anymore, and have never been identified with cpv-2a and -2b variants, nor with fpv strains  <cit> .

in the present study, we showed the presence of fpv proteins, likely vp1/vp <dig>  given the antigens targeted by the cpv1-2a <dig> antibody used  <cit> , in glial cells and neurons from diencephalic region of four cats, mostly the interthalamic adhesion. similarly to observations reported with cpv- <dig> strains  <cit> , the infection of cerebral neurons occurred in the absence of visible cerebellar infection or lesion. this is of utmost interest since some of the cats had a history of neurological signs before death. moreover, one affected cat was adult, this last point raising questions about the possibility of a virus-induced re-entry of post-mitotic neurons into cell cycle  <cit> . to specifically address this point, we assessed the p27kip <dig> expression of fpv-infected neurons by ihc. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip <dig> is expressed in cells that have exited the mitotic cycle  <cit> . anti-p27kip <dig> and anti-fpv immunostainings were realized on serial sections from the same samples and revealed that while most neurons were p27-positive in the nucleus, those infected by fpv were p27-negative, meaning a possible re-entry into the mitotic cycle of some neurons including those expressing fpv proteins  <cit> . the ability of the anti-human p27kip <dig> antibody used in this study to efficiently and specifically bind the feline p27kip <dig> protein had been demonstrated previously  <cit> . further, relatively high concentrations of the antibody with some background reaction were necessary to get a significant nuclear staining. recent evidence suggest that cell cycle re-entry in post-mitotic neurons may occur under specific circumstances  <cit> . although the number of cases included in the present study is too low to be conclusive, this observation deserves to be further investigated. besides, whether the lack of p <dig> expression is a cause or a consequence of the infection of these neurons by fpv remains to be determined.

sequences analyses revealed that a unique l → s substitution was present in the ns <dig> protein from brain-infecting strains and not in other strains presented in this study. this substitution has thus far never been identified, neither in fpv nor in cpv strains. ns <dig> protein of human b <dig> parvovirus is known to cause cell cycle arrest at late s phase, which favors viral dna replication  <cit>  and is pro-apoptotic  <cit> . similarly, minute virus of mice ns <dig> was associated with cell cycle arrest and p <dig> activation  <cit>  and cpv- <dig> ns <dig> was shown to cause caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . it is tempting to hypothesize that fpv ns <dig> could also be able to manipulate the cell cycle. the putative cause to effect of the ns <dig> mutation described for fpv strains in association with productive infection of cerebral neurons in this study deserves additional research. the potential link between this ns <dig> mutation and the lack of p27kip <dig> expression in infected neurons should also be specifically addressed.

lastly, the next-generation sequencing analysis of one parvovirus-infected cat’s brain tissue showed the co-infection by type  <dig> feline bocavirus. bocaviruses are enteric viruses of the parvoviridae family which have been described in several species and only recently in cats  <cit> . the pathogenic potential of these viruses remains to be determined  <cit> . even if not confirmed by in situ histological techniques, the present study is the first report of nervous system infection by a bocavirus. the potential effects of the co-infection with fpv in the affected cat remains to be assessed.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the results presented in this study show that, like cpv- <dig>  fpv is able to infect cerebral neurons of young or adult cats without involvement of the cerebellum. the identification of a unique substitution in ns <dig> protein might be related to this unusual tropism but this hypothesis would require further investigations. this study also provides the first evidence of nervous tissue infection by a bocavirus.
