BACKGROUND
all multicellular organisms rely on evolutionarily selected immune defense mechanisms for protection against faster growing unicellular organisms, such as bacteria, fungi and protozoa, as well as viruses. in addition, multicellular parasites are threats that have to be combated by protective and reactive defense systems. the innate immune system, which is present in all metazoans, possesses the necessary duality in preventing infections and conquering them effectively. the former involves constitutively operating defenses, which are always present and counteract the invasion and growth of microbes, while the latter is based on recognition of the invader and the immediate activation of cascades of parallel immune reactions with the purpose of eradicating the invading organism.

drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism to identify genes involved in the innate immune system and its regulation. several signal transduction pathways are involved in transferring information from the extracellular site of infection to elicit changes in gene expression of effector molecules such as antimicrobial peptides  and reactive oxygen species  . there are several families of amp genes in drosophila and other insects, most of which have been shown to be highly up-regulated in response to infection, primarily a result of signaling via the toll and immune deficiency  pathways. these pathways are activated through extracellular recognition of pathogen-specific signature molecules, such as bacterial peptidoglycans. signal transduction promotes nuclear translocation of the key nf-κb/rel transcription factors dorsal-related immunity factor  and relish, which bind to a large number of target genes and activate their expression. as a result of transcription factor binding, dramatic up- and down-regulation of immune-regulated genes occurs, as was shown in several whole genome expression analyses . immune response genes contain infection-induced response elements , which typically consists of a few nested κb-like sites to which the nf-κb/rel factors bind, linked with target sequences for tissue-specific gata transcription factors  <cit> . constitutive expression of ros and of subsets of amp genes is evident in epithelial linings of the digestive, respiratory and reproductive organs  <cit> . this is controlled via independent regulatory modules, of which a few have been identified and characterized  <cit> .

negative control of immune defense genes is of paramount importance to prevent aberrant activation, and to attenuate the immune response once the infection is eliminated. it has been shown that negative feedback regulation occurs at several levels of both the toll and imd pathways . blocking this negative feedback regulation leads to sustained and/or stronger immune reactions  <cit> . direct transcriptional repression of immune defense genes has also been demonstrated. the homeodomain transcription factor caudal  was shown to act as a gut-specific negative regulator of amp gene expression  <cit> , and drosophila ap <dig> and stat proteins were reported to act as negative regulators of attacina  expression  <cit> . however, continuous presence of commensal microbes in the gut does not promote constitutive activation of large batteries of genes in an nf-κb-dependent manner, therefore additional transcriptional regulators must exist that repress or modulate the expression of immune defense genes.

the pou family of transcription factors constitutes a large group arranged in six subclasses   <cit> . the name pou has its origin from the founding mammalian members pit- <dig> and oct-1/oct- <dig>  and the caenorhabditis elegans unc- <dig> protein  <cit> . five different pou protein genes are present in the drosophila melanogaster genome, belonging to four of the pou family subclasses, indicating that this transcription factor family is evolutionarily ancient  <cit> . the drosophila nub gene ) encodes a class ii pou protein  <cit>  and is a homolog of the human pou2f1/oct- <dig> and pou2f2/oct- <dig> genes  <cit> , with which it shares considerable sequence similarity  <cit> . it has been predicted through genome annotation that the nub gene contains two independent transcription units  that each encode one specific protein variant: nub-pb  and nub-pd , which share the c-terminus, including the dna-binding pou and homeodomains, but differ in their n-termini . the drosophila nub gene was originally identified as a viable mutation, nub <dig>  caused by the insertion of a retrotransposon in the promoter region  <cit>  just upstream of the first exon of the nub-rd transcription unit . the nub gene has been extensively studied for its roles in embryonic development, in differentiation of the central nervous system  <cit> , and for normal growth and patterning of wings and legs  <cit> . more recently, immunostaining of nub protein has been used as an enterocyte cell marker in the adult midgut  <cit> , but the role of nub in these cells has not been defined.

mammalian pou factors are well known regulators of genes involved in both innate and adaptive immune processes. initially, the mammalian class ii factors oct- <dig> and oct- <dig>  were identified as activators of immunoglobulin gene expression in b cells via octamer sequences  <cit> . although the involvement of oct-1/ <dig> in immunoglobulin gene expression and b-cell development could not be confirmed in knock-out mice  <cit> , a large number of immunomodulatory and inflammatory genes have been shown to be targets of oct- <dig> in vitro and in cell-based assays .

we previously isolated cdnas for three pou domain transcription factors in a yeast screen for novel regulators of immune response genes  <cit> . one of these, corresponding to the nub-rd transcript, activated expression of a cecropin a1-luciferase  reporter in drosophila cells, indicating that the nub-pd protein is able to bind and regulate transcription from the ceca <dig> promoter. here we show that nub-pd acts primarily as a negative regulator of immune defense genes. this negative control of effector gene expression seems to be crucial in supporting a normal gut microbiome, as mis-regulated gene expression, due to a mutation in the nub gene, significantly changed the commensal gut flora. the elevated amp gene expression was nf-κb/relish-dependent, and could be blocked by transgene expression of nub-pd, demonstrating its capacity to directly down-regulate expression of immune defense genes. we suggest that nub protein serves a crucial role in suppressing aberrant immune and stress gene activation in healthy flies, thereby promoting immune homeostasis and tolerance to the commensal microflora.

RESULTS
nub is a negative regulator of nf-κb/relish-driven immune gene expression
we isolated a nub cdna in a yeast screen for regulators of the drosophila ceca <dig> gene  <cit> . this cdna represented the nub-rd transcript, expressed from the nub gene, encoding the nub-pd protein form . in drosophila cell culture transfection assays, the nub-rd cdna was found to activate expression of a ceca1-luc reporter construct  <cit> , supporting a possible role as a regulator of immune response genes. this result prompted an in-depth investigation of the in vivo role of this pou transcription factor in regulation of immune gene expression in flies.

to examine if nub-pd is necessary for ceca <dig> expression in vivo, we analyzed the expression of a ceca1-lacz reporter gene in uninfected flies, in a wild-type  and nub <dig> mutant background. in homozygous nub <dig> flies , expression of the nub-rd transcript is strongly reduced  <cit>  and no nub-pd protein is detected on immunoblots , whereas the nub-pb protein is still expressed in the nub <dig> flies, confirming that nub <dig> mutation is specifically affecting the expression of the nub-pd protein. surprisingly, we observed prominent β-galactosidase  reporter staining in the fat body of uninfected nub1; ceca1-lacz flies  compared to the control flies , indicating that nub-pd acts as a negative regulator of ceca <dig> expression in fat body. in addition, we observed strong ceca1-lacz expression in the posterior midgut of nub1; ceca1-lacz flies . to confirm that the elevated β-gal reporter staining is a consequence of the nub <dig> mutation, we used rna interference  to down-regulate nub transcript and protein. expression of a hairpin construct, uas-dsnub, driven by a fat body-specific gal <dig> driver line  in transgenic flies, combined with the ceca1-lacz reporter, promoted strong β-gal reporter staining in the fat body, compared to control flies , strongly supporting that the nub gene is responsible for repression of ceca <dig> in healthy flies.

these results were further substantiated by analyzing the steady-state mrna levels of a few amp genes in extracts of whole flies and dissected guts by quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr  . expression of ceca <dig> and diptericin  was significantly higher in nub <dig> than in wt flies , whereas drosomycin  expression was only slightly increased . to eliminate the possibility that the high level of amp gene expression was due to the presence of an ongoing infection, and not the nub <dig> mutation, we treated flies with a potent cocktail of antibiotics prior to the analysis. antibiotic-treated and untreated flies promoted similar levels of high ceca <dig> and dipt expression , indicating that nub-pd was responsible for the repression of the expression of at least these two amp genes, and also suggesting that activation, that is, de-repression, occurs both in the absence and presence of commensal microbes in healthy flies. the ceca <dig> and dipt genes are well-established targets of nf-κb/relish transcriptional activation. importantly, we found that the high steady-state expression of ceca <dig> and dipt in uninfected nub <dig> flies is relish-dependent, because it was significantly reduced in rele <dig> mutants , whereas the small but significant up-regulation of drs in nub <dig> flies was relish-independent. taken together, this indicates that nub-pd acts as a transcriptional repressor of relish-dependent genes, possibly rendering these genes inactive in the absence of infection. in accordance with this assumption, we found that in the midgut, where relish was previously shown to be constitutively cleaved and activated  <cit> , ceca1-lacz reporter staining was prominent in nub <dig> mutants . in addition, ceca <dig> and dipt mrna levels were significantly elevated in dissected guts from nub <dig> flies compared to wt controls . we conclude that nub-pd acts as a negative regulator of relish-dependent ceca <dig> and dipt gene expression both in the gut and fat body. in response to bacterial infection, expression of ceca <dig>  dipt and drs mrnas was potently activated both in wt control and nub <dig> flies . the expression levels of all three genes were reproducibly higher in nub <dig> compared to wt, suggesting a negative effect of the presence of nub-pd in wt flies. however, due to large biological variation in transcriptional response to infection, especially in the nub <dig> mutant, the difference was not statistically significant . in summary, our results indicate that nub-pd is a negative regulator of the expression of at least two amp genes, ceca <dig> and dipt, in healthy flies. in response to infection, activation is dominant and repression is to a large extent alleviated, leading to strong immune gene expression in both wt and nub <dig> flies; at the same time, some de-repression was evident in nub <dig> mutants.

the commensal bacterial load is significantly diminished in guts of nub <dig> mutant flies
a possible consequence of the elevated amp gene expression in guts of nub <dig> flies is that the numbers of commensal bacteria would be reduced. to test this we plated the gut content from individual flies on bacterial medium  and found that whereas wt flies typically contained between  <dig> to  <dig> colony forming units per gut, no bacterial colonies grew from the guts of nub <dig> mutants  , indicating that nub <dig> guts constitute a highly bacteriostatic environment. although no colonies grew, we do not consider the guts of nub <dig> mutants to be completely devoid of bacteria, because amplification of bacterial 16s rrna genes indicated that guts from nub <dig> mutants do contain bacteria . our conclusion is, however, that the numbers of live, cultivatable bacteria in guts of nub <dig> mutants is strikingly diminished compared with that of wt flies. thus, in the absence of a functional nub-pd protein as in nub <dig> mutants, the gut microbiome is severely affected, most likely as a consequence of the increased expression of amps and possibly of other immune effector molecules.

nub-pd expression in nub <dig> flies is sufficient to restore a repressed status of target gene expression
to investigate directly if nub-pd acts as a transcriptional repressor of immune system genes, we over-expressed nub-pd from a uas-nub-rd construct in nub <dig> mutant background. we first analyzed expression of four amp genes, ceca <dig>  cecc, dipt and attc, in nub1; uas-nub control flies, confirming strong over-expression of all four genes . a number of different gal <dig> driver lines were then tested: the use of strong/ubiquitous drivers was lethal whereas tissue-specific drivers only promoted marginal nub-rd over-expression. using a heat-shock promoter-driven gal <dig>  it was also not possible to achieve high levels of nub mrna expression after heat-shock induction, although several different experimental regimes were tested. it is unclear why this is the case, but it may indicate that strong over-expression of nub-rd results in negative feedback regulation, most likely at the post-transcriptional level. however, approximately 10-fold over-expression of nub-rd was reached routinely using leaky expression from the same transgene combination  . this relatively moderate level of nub-rd over-expression in a nub <dig> mutant background  was sufficient to reduce ceca <dig>  dipt, cecc and attc expression levels by 50% to 80% compared to nub1; uas-nub-rd/tm <dig> control flies , demonstrating that nub-pd acts directly as a negative regulator of gene expression. it also confirms that aberrant expression of these immune genes in nub <dig> flies is truly due to the lack of a functional nub-pd protein and not caused by the genetic background of the stock, as expression of uas-nub-rd was sufficient to restore the repressed status of these genes. in infected flies, over-expression of nub-rd did not reveal a significant effect on the expression of ceca <dig> and dipt . as suggested above, this indicates that nub-pd repression is relieved during infection.

repression of ceca <dig> by nub-pd requires an upstream oct motif cluster
we have previously reported that the upstream regulatory region of the ceca <dig> gene contains both positively and negatively acting regulatory elements, based on experimental evidence from promoter-reporter constructs in transgenic flies  <cit> . similar to mammalian oct1/ <dig> transcription factors, nub-pd has been shown to bind with high affinity to the oct consensus motif  and to several closely related motifs  <cit>  as well as more divergent non-oct motifs  <cit> . we searched the ceca <dig> upstream region for these sequence motifs and found that it harbors an oct cluster, containing three oct consensus motifs, two oct-like/nub motifs of the type present in the drosophila choline acetyltransferase gene  <cit>  and one variant of the latter overlapping with a κb site, located just 5′ of the ire . we did not find any sequences matching the nub binding sites  reported to be responsible for repression of the vestigial gene  <cit> .

to investigate if the upstream region containing the oct cluster is involved in repressing ceca <dig> expression in uninfected flies, we analyzed the expression of ceca1-lacz constructs in transgenic flies carrying either a complete upstream region  or with a 5′ deletion, lacking the whole oct cluster  . both constructs contain the ire, which has previously been shown to contain necessary target sequences for nf-κb and gata transcription factors  <cit> , and to promote strong reporter gene expression in response to infection  <cit> . as a positive control, we analyzed the expression of ceca1-lacz in flies in which nub had been down-regulated by rnai in the fat body . this promoted strong reporter gene expression in the fat body of flies exposed to rnai  compared with the matched control flies, in which rnai was not induced . two independent transgenic lines carrying the pa <dig> ceca1-lacz transgene conferred strong reporter gene expression in abdominal fat body , demonstrating that in the absence of the upstream region including the oct cluster, the ceca <dig> promoter is constitutively active in the fat body. the staining was remarkably strong compared with the control pa <dig> ceca1-lacz flies , and similar to the pattern and reporter strength of pa <dig> ceca1-lacz in nub rnai flies . it is important to note that the whole experiment was carried out with uninfected flies, confirming that the ceca <dig> promoter normally is repressed in healthy flies but aberrantly activated in nub-depleted flies. expression of pa <dig> ceca1-lacz was equally strong in abdominal fat body regardless of whether the flies had been exposed to nub-rnai  or not . this indicates that nub-pd primarily represses ceca <dig> expression via sequences present in the − <dig> to − <dig> bp region.

next we created a luc reporter construct with an internal deletion of the oct cluster region from − <dig> to − <dig>  , and analyzed its expression in transiently transfected drosophila mbn- <dig> cells. specific deletion of the oct cluster promoted 25-fold higher expression levels compared to the pa10-luc control , clearly demonstrating that the oct cluster region acts as a negative cis-regulatory element.

in conclusion, deletion of the oct cluster strongly enhances expression from the ceca <dig> promoter both in cell transfections and in vivo. in addition, deletion of the ceca <dig> upstream region that contains the oct cluster leads to excessive ceca1-lacz expression in a very similar manner as down-regulation of nub by rnai, suggesting that nub-pd regulates ceca <dig> by binding to the oct cluster.

nub protein is expressed in fat body and midgut of uninfected flies
it has previously been shown that nub is expressed in the developing central nervous system of embryos  <cit>  and in wing, haltere and leg discs of third instar larvae  <cit> . except for distinct localization in midgut enterocytes  <cit> , it is not known if nub protein is expressed in immunoresponsive tissues. we produced an affinity-purified peptide-specific antibody against nub. immunoblot experiments confirmed the specificity of the antibody and also validated the recent annotation of the nub gene to encode two proteins of  <dig> kda  and  <dig> kda  . strong immunostaining in wing and leg imaginal discs of third instar larvae confirmed localization of nub protein in these tissues . immunostaining of adult tissues in cryosections of whole flies revealed that nub protein is present in fat body , midgut  and testis . this correlates well with reported expression of nub transcripts in adults  <cit> . nub immunostaining was not restricted in its subcellular localization to either nucleus or cytoplasm, instead its nuclear-cytoplasmic localization varied in different regions of these tissues, possibly reflecting alternative states of transcriptional regulation. in conclusion, nub is expressed in immune-responsive tissues, such as fat body and midgut of healthy flies, which would enable nub protein to act as a transcriptional repressor of immune genes in the absence of infection.

chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that nub binds to antimicrobial peptide genes in vivo
in vitro dna-protein interaction assays have previously demonstrated that nub-pd binds with high affinity to the oct sequence motif  <cit> . to analyze if nub protein directly binds to the promoter regions of amp genes, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation assays . the pcr primers used for amplification were located to cover one or several oct sites in the 5′ regions of analyzed genes . nub protein bound to the promoter regions of ceca <dig>  cecc, attc and dipta were isolated using the nub-specific antibody . importantly, nub protein did not bind to the act5c or to a non-transcribed intergenic region . omitting the nub antibody abolished the pcr product of all genes . as an additional control of specificity, we used an antibody against the c-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii, which is anticipated to neither bind to the relatively far 5′ upstream regions analyzed here nor to amp gene promoters in uninfected conditions  <cit> . as expected, the c-terminal domain of rna polymerase ii antibody did not bind to any of the amp gene promoters but showed weak binding to the act5c transcription unit . phenol-chloroform extraction of isolated chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation abolished the pcr product in all samples , validating that the immunoprecipitation requires the presence of protein bound to dna. this chip demonstrates that nub protein physically interacts with the promoter region of several amp genes, strongly indicating that this physical interaction is responsible for repression of these genes in the absence of infection.

a large number of genes involved in immune system processes are up-regulated in nub <dig> flies
to investigate if nub-pd acts as a general repressor of immune gene transcription in healthy flies, we analyzed the global mrna expression profile in nub <dig> mutants compared to wt flies by microarray analysis using affymetrix gene chip drosophila genome  <dig>  oligonucleotide arrays. prior to mrna extraction, the flies were dissected so that the two major immunoresponsive tissues, fat body  and the digestive system  were analyzed separately. the raw data were normalized, pre-processed and filtered to remove genes that were not expressed at a detectable level . a factorial map of principal component analysis reveales that the individual biological samples cluster together within their own sample group, showing that the replicates are well represented as a population . the variance seen within each sample group is biologically expected as each sample is a pooled set of flies. sample groups are firstly separated on the basis of tissue  and secondly on strain . no outlier samples were detected, hence all samples were included in further analysis. by comparing nub <dig> to the wt counterpart, either carcass or gut, we found  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts to be differentially expressed by a fold change of two or higher. out of these,  <dig> were differentially expressed in both carcass and gut .

to further analyze the differentially expressed transcripts found in each sample type in nub <dig> versus wt, a gene set enrichment analysis was conducted identifying overrepresented gene ontology  categories. the differentially expressed transcripts in carcass nub <dig> compared to wt are dominated by genes preferentially expressed in ‘immune and response processes’  . within this cluster of  <dig> genes  we find many well-characterized immune effector genes, such as amps and those involved in ros production; immune recognition proteins, such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins ; thioester proteins; and scavenger receptors. we also find genes involved in responses to abiotic stress, such as heat-shock proteins, detoxifying proteins, dna damage repair, oxidative stress and wound healing. when we included ceca <dig> and dipt, which were not present on the microarray but analyzed separately , we identified in total  <dig> immune defense and stress response genes that were differentially regulated in nub <dig> flies compared with wt. out of these,  <dig>   were up-regulated in carcass samples in nub <dig> flies, supporting that nub-pd primarily acts as a repressor of immune- and stress-related genes. a large fraction of the ‘immune defense genes’ have previously been shown to be up-regulated by microbial infections in an nf-κb/relish dependent manner . we suggest that nub-pd plays an important role in repressing immune defense genes, because the presence of commensal microbes will also lead to a low level of constitutive activation of nf-κb/relish in uninfected conditions. nub-pd will thereby increase tolerance to the presence of commensal microbes in healthy individuals.

similar analyses of dissected gut samples also revealed significant enrichment  of genes involved in different types of ‘response processes’ among the nub <dig> mis-regulated genes . within this combined cluster, consisting of  <dig> unique genes, 47% were up-regulated in nub <dig> gut compared to wt . similar to the carcass samples, we identified genes involved in immune recognition, signaling and effector processes, as well as in abiotic stress responses among the nub <dig> mis-regulated genes . combining the sets of over-represented genes in carcass and gut samples involved in immune defense and other response processes, we found an overlap of  <dig> unique genes that are differentially expressed in nub <dig> flies compared to wt. a hierarchical cluster analysis of these genes  shows that immune defense genes cluster together and are over-represented among genes that are up-regulated in nub <dig> mutants in either carcass or gut, or both.

from this global mrna analysis, we conclude that numerous genes involved in immune defense reactions are abnormally expressed in nub <dig> mutant flies. importantly, essentially all of the differentially regulated immune response genes have previously been experimentally validated for their functional roles in the immune system. in addition to genes clearly involved in the immune defense, the response processes clusters include genes with pertinent roles in cellular stress response processes, such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, heat-shock, dna damage/repair and apoptosis. this suggests that nub-pd may not only be involved in protecting flies against aberrant activation of immune system genes but also moderate responses to other types of cellular stress. we believe that nub-pd acts as a modulator of immune responses, by preventing inappropriate expression of potent effector molecules. the array results also indicate that nub-pd may play a role in regulation of stress responses, either directly or indirectly, but this assumption needs to be further validated.

genes involved in metabolism, development and differentiation require nub-pd for normal expression
both in carcass and gut samples, go processes related to metabolism and catabolism were strongly enriched  among the differentially expressed transcripts in nub <dig> mutants compared to wt . by combining the sets of over-represented genes in carcass and gut samples, we found an overlap of  <dig> unique genes involved in metabolic and catabolic processes, and differentially expressed by a factor of at least two in nub <dig> flies compared to its wt counterpart. of these genes, 48% were down-regulated in gut in nub <dig> mutants , indicating an important role for nub-pd in maintaining normal function in the gut and in metabolic homeostasis.

the role of nub in developmental processes during development of larval and adult structures, such as nervous system, wing and leg, is well documented  <cit> . our gene expression analysis of nub <dig> mutants revealed that in the adult gut, there is differential expression of similar clusters of genes that previously have been linked to nervous system development , development and differentiation of wing and legs , and subgroups of these go terms . again, there is much overlap between these groups with  <dig> unique genes shared between the go biological processes ‘development and differentiation’ and ‘nervous system’. a large proportion of these genes cluster together  and are down-regulated in nub <dig> gut samples, indicating that these genes normally require nub-pd for their expression in the gut. of these genes, many are known components of signaling pathways involved in patterning and differentiation of the nervous system in the embryo, and in wing and leg development during metamorphosis. this indicates that the same regulatory systems, involving nub-pd, also operate in the adult gut, most likely during gut regeneration and differentiation of the gut epithelium.

genes that are mis-regulated in nub <dig> mutants contain oct sequence motifs
having demonstrated that nub protein directly binds to the upstream region of several amp genes, we decided to perform a survey for oct sites in the upstream region of genes that were differentially expressed in nub <dig> compared to wt flies . we focused our attention on genes belonging to go terms related to immune defense, but also included a number of the most differentially expressed non-immune genes, and a few house-keeping genes as controls. in total,  <dig> genes were searched for the presence of the consensus oct site ataaa and the oct-like/nub target motif attcaaat, present in the gene for drosophila choline acetyltransferase  <cit> . we found a clear correlation between genes that were mis-regulated in nub <dig> mutants and the presence of oct sites in the promoter and upstream region , whereas three typical immune system genes  whose expressions were not changed in nub <dig> mutant flies did not contain any oct sites . four house-keeping or reference genes that did not confer any mis-expression in nub <dig> mutants were also analyzed, revealing only one oct site in the distal promoter region of one of these genes. as has been mentioned above, of the genes that showed differential expression in nub <dig> versus wt flies, and of the genes analyzed here, 71% were up-regulated and out of those, all but two were found to contain at least one consensus oct site. it is important to note, however, that at least six immune response genes that were down-regulated in nub <dig> gut tissue also contained oct sites , suggesting that nub-pd regulates constitutive expression of some immune system genes in the gut via oct sites. in conclusion, in silico analysis of gene promoters of genes that are mis-regulated in nub <dig> flies strongly indicates that nub-pd directly controls a large group of immune system genes, as well as other genes, via oct sequence motifs.

discussion
immune defense processes have to be instant and powerful to fight emergent infections efficiently and rescue the host. minute concentrations of immune elicitors can communicate the presence of foreign organisms, which will lead to coordinated changes in expression of downstream effector genes. however, unprovoked activation of immune responses can be harmful because production of very potent biological effector molecules may cause damage to host tissues. also, switching of gene regulatory programs may interfere with normal growth, development and other essential processes. both signaling and gene expression need to be well controlled both before and after the acute stage of an infection, to regulate the rapid and powerful activation followed by attenuation of immune effector gene expression. in drosophila, several negative regulators of immune regulatory pathways have been identified, especially for the imd pathway  <cit> . very few direct repressors of immune gene transcription have been identified, although it is generally acknowledged that dedicated transcriptional repressors are equally important as upstream regulatory pathways that limit production and activity of transcriptional activators  <cit> . the homeodomain protein cad was shown to inhibit relish-dependent expression of amp genes in the posterior midgut, and down-regulation of cad by rnai promoted over-expression of amp genes  <cit> . similarly, expression of atta was reported to be inhibited by a repressosome complex, consisting of dap- <dig>  stat92e and the high mobility group  protein dsp <dig>  <cit> . the present work show that the drosophila pou transcription factor nub-pd is an important transcriptional repressor of immune defense genes.

our work suggests that nub-pd can act both as an activator and a repressor, but the mechanism for this switch is not yet known. it has previously been shown, using transcription assays in saccharomyces cerevisiae, that drosophila nub-pd binds to oct sequence motifs to regulate transcription. direct transactivation capacity was limited, suggesting that co-activators play a role  <cit> . we show that nub-pd directly binds to proximal promoter regions of several amp genes in chromatin prepared from whole flies. these promoter regions contain one or several oct sites, of which some are overlapping with or located near ire containing κb and/or gata sites. it may be possible that the mechanism of nub-pd repression involves direct competition for binding sequences. however, it may also depend on post-translational modifications, interactions with co-factors and chromatin remodeling complexes.

we show that nub protein is present in nuclei of fat body cells and in all regions of the gut in healthy flies , which makes it an ideal gate-keeper of immune gene expression. it was previously shown that the presence of peptidoglycan from commensal microbes leads to low levels of constitutive activation of nf-κb/relish in the midgut  <cit> . while it can be debated whether the fat body is under continuous immune challenge or not, it has been shown that small peptidoglycan fragments shed from live or dead bacteria can cross barrier epithelia and activate a systemic immune response in the fat body  <cit> . without protective mechanisms, this would lead to constant activation of immune and inflammatory reactions. clearly, in the absence of nub-pd, immune gene expression is over-active both in the gut and in the fat body; remarkably, this leads to serious consequences for the commensal gut flora, which are severely affected in nub <dig> mutants. we propose that nub-pd plays an important role in several immunoresponsive tissues by suppressing immune activation and allowing the continuous presence of a commensal gut microbiome. the effects observed in nub <dig> flies are reminiscent of inflammatory diseases in mammals, in which gut homeostasis is disrupted and the immune system is constantly activated by the presence of the commensal gut flora. the present study indicates that negative regulation by pou/oct transcription factor are crucial in flies for suppression of immune activation, thereby promoting tolerance to the gut commensal flora. it has not yet been explored if negative regulation by pou/oct or other transcription factors normally promote tolerance to the commensal flora in healthy mammals, neither has the lack of such negative regulation been surveyed as a possible cause of chronic inflammatory disease establishment.

we show that at least  <dig> immune defense genes are over-expressed in flies lacking nub-pd , suggesting that it serves as a general repressor of immune gene expression in the absence of true infections. most of the up-regulated genes encode direct effectors of the immune defense, such as amps and enzymes that synthesize ros. this elevated expression of immune defense genes in the gut had a striking effect on the commensal gut flora of nub <dig> mutants. a majority of the up-regulated genes have previously been shown to be targets of the nf-κb/relish/imd pathway or a combination of nf-κb/relish/imd and nf-κb/dif/toll pathways  <cit> . a few toll pathway components were found to be down-regulated in nub <dig> mutants, such as persephone, gnbp <dig> and wntd. it is important to note that genes encoding negative regulators of the immune response were either up-regulated in nub <dig> mutants  or not significantly changed , demonstrating that, in the nub <dig> mutant, the increased expression level of a large number of effectors, such as amp genes, is not an indirect effect due to decreased expression of the above mentioned negative regulators. we also did not observe any changed expression of co-activators that have been connected with immune pathway signaling or nf-κb-dependent expression , nejiere , akirin and helicase89b), arguing against indirect effects via these factors. we confirmed that ceca <dig> and dipt were also up-regulated in nub <dig> mutants after treatment with antibiotics , excluding that excessive expression in nub <dig> mutants is caused by ongoing infections. the over-expression of these genes was, however, to a large extent nf-κb/relish-dependent, suggesting that nf-κb/relish can be activated by the presence of peptidoglycan fragments from dying or dead bacteria. our conclusion is that over-expression of immune genes in nub <dig> mutant flies is to a large extent imd pathway- and nf-κb/relish-dependent, but did not require presence of live bacteria. taken together, these results strongly indicate that nub-pd directly represses a large number of immune system genes in healthy flies.

the whole genome analysis in nub <dig> mutants revealed a comprehensive picture of the role of nub-pd in regulation of genes involved in the fly’s immune system. in addition, genes that belong to go categories of stress response processes and metabolism or catabolism processes were also strongly enriched in nub <dig> mutants. this is highly reminiscent of results from gene expression profiling carried out with mammalian oct- <dig> deficient cells, which showed a clear over-representation of genes involved in cellular, oxidative and metabolic stress responses. the oct- <dig> deficient cells were hypersensitive to a number of different stress conditions, indicating that oct- <dig> normally controls the activation of such effector genes  <cit> . in addition, oct- <dig> responds to camp signaling in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells and may play a role in metabolic homeostasis  <cit> . interestingly, oct- <dig> has been shown to repress cytokine-induced, nf-κb-dependent expression of the genes for e-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecules  <cit> . this was shown to be part of a system involving oct- <dig> repression of nf-κb target genes involved in inflammatory processes, and to maintain vascular cells in a quiescent state. it is intriguing that both in insects and mammals, repression of nf-κb-dependent target genes by nub-pd and oct- <dig>  respectively, seems to be a hallmark of balancing immune, inflammatory and stress responses. we suggest that these evolutionarily related transcription factors are ancient stress sensors that modulate responses and gene activity, and increase the tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stress.

CONCLUSIONS
this work sheds new light on the complex regulation of innate immunity. we show that the pou/oct transcription factor nub negatively regulates genes involved in immune responses. nub-pd protein binds to upstream sequences and represses gene expression of several amp genes in healthy flies. importantly, flies that lack expression of nub-pd protein have a significantly changed gut microbiome, indicating that the maintenance of a normal gut flora is dependent on negative gene regulation by nub-pd. whole genome expression data show that a large number of immune- and stress-regulated genes are normally controlled directly or indirectly by nub-pd, while other groups of genes, involved in development and metabolic processes, require nub-pd for their normal expression. this demonstrates that nub, similar to mammalian pou/oct proteins, is involved in both positive and negative gene regulation. importantly, our experimental data provide support for the evolutionary conservation of innate immunity between flies and mammals. this conservation involves not only positive regulation by toll receptor pathways and nf-κb transcription factors upon infection but also includes complex regulation by pou/oct transcription factors to modulate gene activity in healthy subjects.
