BACKGROUND
hymenopteran venoms have been intensively studied in social species such as bees, bumblebees, wasps, hornets and ants  <cit> . most of the major allergens have been identified in species of medical importance through a combination of transcriptomic, proteomic, peptidomic and glycomic techniques recently gathered under the newly proposed term of venomic approaches  <cit> . in comparison, little has been done on the venom composition of parasitoid hymenoptera although they represent more than 75% of described hymenopteran species and 10-20% of all insect species  <cit> . fundamental benefits expected from venomic approaches applied to parasitic wasp venoms would consist, for example, in the discrimination between cellular transcripts present in the venom glands and those encoding true venom proteins, through the proteomic analysis of venom fluid. moreover comprehensive analyses would allow a deeper characterization of weakly expressed venom components and a comparative work aiming at retracing the evolutionary history of hymenopteran venoms. parasitoid venom proteins also constitute an underestimated source of toxins that could be studied for a variety of applied uses.

parasitic wasps constitute by far the largest group of parasitic insects with an estimated total number of species of approximately  <dig>  <dig>  <cit> . some develop outside  and others inside  the body of an insect or other arthropod host and, depending on the species, various stages of the host can be parasitized . in ectoparasitoid species, venoms often induce paralysis and/or regulate host development, metabolism and immune responses  <cit> . venom proteins from endoparasitic wasps are predominately involved in regulation of host physiology and immune responses alone or in combination with other factors of maternal origin such as polydnaviruses  or virus-like particles present in the venom itself or produced in the ovaries and ovarian fluids  <cit> . for example, venoms can synergize the effects of pdvs  <cit>  and can interfere with host's humoral  <cit>  and cellular immune components  <cit> .

to date, less than  <dig> proteins have been individually identified and characterized from the venoms of a restricted number of parasitoid wasps species  <cit> . broader studies have also previously investigated the composition of parasitoid venoms by the separate use of proteomic or transcriptomic approaches combined with bioinformatic analyses. a recent analysis of the venom proteome of the pupal ectoparasitoid wasp nasonia vitripennis has been published, that benefited from the sequencing and annotation of this wasp genome  <cit> . twelve venom proteins from the endoparasitoid pteromalus puparum were also identified recently using a proteomic approach  <cit> . on the other hand, transcriptome analyses allowed the identification of venom proteins in the pupal endoparasitoid pimpla hypochondriaca  <cit>  and in two adult endoparasitoid species of the genus microctonus  <cit> . although these works are undoubtedly of great interest, most of them did not provide absolute evidence that all identified proteins were venom components. therefore, there is still a crucial need for extensive analyses by combining various techniques of investigation at the molecular level to allow comparisons between species.

chelonus inanitus  is original among the parasitoid species currently studied in being an egg-larval endoparasitoid species. indeed it oviposits into the eggs of its host, spodoptera littoralis  and the parasitoid larva then develops inside the host embryo and early larval stages. due to its lifestyle, c. inanitus must thus face up to particular physiological constraints imposed by its immature hosts. the venom, along with pdvs produced in the reproductive system of this wasp, are essential for successful parasitism as they protect the parasitoid from encapsulation by host's immune cells  <cit> , interfere with the host's nutritional physiology  <cit>  and induce a developmental arrest in the prepupal stage  <cit> . venom of c. inanitus by itself alters the membrane permeability of host hemocytes, has a transient paralytic effect  <cit>  and synergizes the effect of the pdvs on host development  <cit> . the data gathered on the functions of its venom make c. inanitus a valuable model for investigating the venom proteins. at least  <dig> proteins were found  <cit>  but their sequences were unknown. the sequences of only two venom proteins from another species of the subfamily cheloninae, chelonus sp. near curvimaculatus, had been described to date  <cit> .

we report here the analysis of c. inanitus venom gland products based on the sequencing of clones of a cdna library and on mass spectrometry analysis of venom proteins. this is the first time that this combination of techniques was applied to identify venom proteins from an endoparasitic wasp. the data obtained might contribute to acquiring a more comprehensive view on the origin and functional diversity of venom proteins among hymenoptera.

RESULTS
general overview of the cdna library of c. inanitus venom gland
the  <dig> ests from the venom glands of c. inanitus were clustered into  <dig> clusters . the number of ests in each contig ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and these clusters were considered as putative unigenes. the deduced sequences from  <dig> clusters  shared significant similarities with protein sequences deposited in non-redundant databases , a proportion comparable to that found by crawford et al.  <cit>  which have studied the venom gland transcriptome of the parasitoid wasp microctonus hyperodae. of these products,  <dig>  shared significant similarity with proteins with assigned molecular functions in the gene ontology database. this relatively low percentage is explained in part by the fact that the function of the most represented sequence  referred below as ci-23a, is unknown. at level  <dig> of the gene ontology system, clusters were classified into  <dig> molecular functional categories , among which "binding"  and "catalytic activity"  categories were over-represented . interestingly, these categories were also the most common functional categories assigned to the venom glands ests from the saw-scaled viper, echis ocellatus  <cit>  and from the solitary hunting wasp species, orancistrocerus drewseni  <cit> . catalytic activity and binding categories thus constitute a hallmark of the venom gland transcriptomes analysed to date. a "structural molecule activity" function  has been assigned to  <dig> clusters  that corresponded essentially to genes coding for structural constituents of ribosomes . in addition, products of genes functionally annotated as "translation regulator activity"   and "transcription regulator activity"   were also identified, which encompassed transcriptional regulators, dna or rna binding proteins and translation elongation factors. all these proteins presumably reflect the metabolic effort invested by the venom gland for the transcription and translation of secreted products. the  <dig> ests were used to produce in silico a database of venom gland open reading frames  which were matched to the peptide sequences obtained by nano-lc-ms/ms analysis. an overall of  <dig> ests  were then identified as coding for venom proteins of c. inanitus.

identification of the venom proteins of c. inanitus
venoms of parasitic wasps are reputed to have a low content in small proteins and peptides in comparison to venoms of social hymenoptera  <cit> . upon separation of c. inanitus venom proteins by sds-page, at least  <dig> proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda had been observed while no bands were seen below  <dig> kda. this was also consistent with data previously reported  <cit>  from the analysis of sds-page and two-dimension electrophoresis gels stained with silver or coomassie blue staining methods. for the nano-lc-ms/ms analysis presented here, several gradient gels  were run at various conditions to allow excision of all gel bands detectable upon coomassie blue staining. figure  <dig> shows that the analysed bands represent the majority of the venom proteins of c. inanitus. however, the presence in this venom of small amounts of additional proteins and peptides cannot be excluded. for  <dig> proteins, named ci-14a to ci- <dig>  peptide sequences exactly matching sequences of the vgorf database were obtained upon nano-lc-ms/ms analysis . furthermore, peptides belonging to four additional proteins were detected, namely vem <dig>  vem <dig>  vem <dig> and vem <dig> . these proteins were found in several gel bands, a situation usually found for very abundant proteins. there was no evident correspondence between the relative abundance of venom protein bands on the gel  and the abundance of the corresponding ests in the vgorfs database . the detailed list of the identified venom proteins will be discussed in the following sections.

protein names for which a signal peptide has been predicted are shown in bold; p, partial sequence.

ci-23a and ci- <dig>  two proteins with similarities with venom proteins from c. sp. near curvimaculatus
the ci-23a venom protein was encoded by a contig corresponding to the highest number of ests in the library . it displays 50% of sequence identity  with a  <dig>  kda protein referred as "venom protein from c. sp. near curvimaculatus" , another chelonine wasp. this latter protein was historically the first to be isolated and sequenced from the venom of a parasitoid hymenoptera  <cit> . although it was found to be necessary for the survival of the parasitoid in the lepidopteran host, trichoplusia ni  <cit> , it is still not related to any other known protein and its function remains unknown to date. a potential cleavage site for both n-arginine dibasic convertase  and subtilisin-like proprotein convertase  was detected at positions  <dig> to  <dig>  of the ci-23a sequence. however, sequences coding for such convertases were not found in our vgorfs database. remarkably, ci-23a was devoid of the  <dig> tandem repeats of  <dig> residues that characterized the c-terminal part of the venom protein of c. sp. near curvimaculatus   <cit> . these repeat sequences form several α-helices with strong amphipathic structures supposed to run at the surface of the protein  <cit>  and we found that they contain an unusualy high number of potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites  ). thus ci-23a, which is much shorter than its homologue, is potentially processed by non-venomous convertases and is likely to have a substrate or target site specificity different from that of the  <dig>  kda venom protein of c. sp. near curvimaculatus. interestingly, the latter is a very abundant venom protein  <cit>  while ci-23a protein is of low abundance .

the ci- <dig> venom protein, which gives a strong band upon coomassie staining , shows high similarity  to a  <dig> kda chitinase from venom of c. sp. near curvimaculatus   <cit> . both proteins possess a predicted signal peptide and a glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> domain  with four highly conserved regions present in all known insect chitinases  <cit>  . members of glycosyl hydrolases  <dig> family show an eight-stranded α/β barrel catalytic core structure  <cit> . the  <dig> residues featuring this functional domain were all found in the ci- <dig> sequence, notably those of the second conserved region implicated in catalysis, as shown by previous site-directed mutagenesis studies dgdldeyp))  <cit> . four cysteine residues involved in two disulfide bonds are conserved in the two cheloninae enzymes and the secondary structures of both proteins were predicted to be highly similar in the placement of α-helix, β-strand and coil structure . ci- <dig> differs from its homologue by the absence of a c-terminal chitin-binding peritrophin-a domain , but this domain does not appear to be essential for the chitinolytic activity of chitinases in arthropods  <cit> . the ci- <dig> contig is thus most likely coding for an active venom chitinase and might be responsible for the chitinase activity previously detected in the venom of c. inanitus  <cit> . according to the classification proposed by zhu et al.  <cit> , it belongs to a group of conserved insect chitinases containing a single catalytic domain . our phylogenetic analysis  grouped the chitinases from venom glands of c. inanitus and c. sp. near curvimaculatus in a monophyletic clade with that from teratocytes of t. nigriceps . teratocytes are parasitoid wasp secretory cells that circulate into the parasitized host haemolymph, and represent a different way for the wasp to deliver virulence factors into the host. the teratocyte released chitinase from t. nigriceps is hypothesized to contribute to the avoidance of microbial contamination of the host's haemocoel or to facilitate the emergence of parasitoid larvae through the host's cuticle  <cit> . other examples of chitinases produced by venom glands were previously reported from spiders  <cit>  and from the parasitoid wasps m. hyperodae  <cit>  and n. vitripennis  <cit> . more recently, a chitinase produced by the posterior salivary glands of the cephalopod octopus kaurna has also been described  <cit> . venom and salivary glands chitinases described are thus restricted to invertebrate species. interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis shows that venom chitinases belong to distinct clades comprising also non venomous enzymes. this suggests chitinases have been selected for production in invertebrate venom glands through multiple independent recruitment events.

ci-48b, an idgf-like protein
like ci- <dig>  ci-48b possesses a glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> domain -like proteins from different insect species). however, in the second conserved region, a glutamine residue  replaces the glutamic acid residue that plays a key role in active insect and bacterial chitinases, in being the putative proton donor during the catalytic mechanism  <cit> . this feature is shared by members of the imaginal disc growth factors  family which have presumably evolved from chitinases to gain new functions  <cit> . interestingly, ci-48b shows high sequence similarity to igdfs from several insect species, namely a venom gland protein of honey bee workers  and a hemocyte aggregation inhibitor protein from the lepidopteran species manduca sexta    <cit> . thus ci-48b may contribute to the survival and development of c. inanitus eggs once oviposited into their host either by acting as a growth factor or alternatively, by modulating the cellular immune response of young s. littoralis host larvae.

ci-23c and ci- <dig>  two putative mucin-like peritrophins
the sequence of the ci-23c venom protein is  <dig> amino acid long, giving a theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda . it possesses two chitin-binding peritrophin domains  <dig>  and a predicted glycosaminoglycan attachment site . another venom protein, ci- <dig> , also contains two cbm_ <dig> domains  and a predicted glycosaminoglycan attachment site . the two proteins share an overall 32% identity  and show sequence similarities to a wide variety of cbm_ <dig> domains containing proteins, including a venom component from n. vitripennis  <cit> . moreover they share the domain organization of the mucine-like peritrophin ad- <dig> identified from the salivary gland transcriptome of the mosquito anopheles darlingi . interestingly this peritrophin is speculated to contribute to the maintenance of the structure of the mouthparts and/or salivary canal of a. darlingi  <cit> . in c. inanitus, oviposition is accompanied by intense contractions of the abdomen, which are necessary to push the venom from the reservoir into the oviduct, since the venom reservoir is located at the distal end of one of the gland filaments and has a very thin wall without a muscle layer  <cit> . it is thus possible that the venom proteins ci-23c and ci- <dig>  as the mosquito peritrophin, contribute to keeping the reservoir in shape.

vem <dig>  an ancient yellow-e3-like venom protein
vem <dig> shares high sequence similarity to the yellow-e <dig> protein  from a. mellifera . the yellow-e <dig> gene is highly expressed in the head and hypopharyngeal gland of honey bee workers and is considered as the progenitor of all genes of major royal jelly proteins  of a. mellifera. located in the same genomic region and sharing a similar exon/intron organization, mrjps would have been generated via recent duplications  <cit> . recently, two members of the mrjps family, mrjp <dig>  and mrjp <dig> , were identified in the venom gland proteome of a. mellifera  <cit> . it is noteworthy that phylogenetic analyses put them at the basis of the mrjps tree, meaning that they are the most ancient members of the mrjps family and suggesting a venomous "pre-royal jelly" function for the mrjps progenitor originating from yellow-e <dig>  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis shows that vem <dig> forms a monophyletic group with yellow-e- <dig> protein  and thus represents the first example of a venomous protein in this clade. this supports the hypothesis that a yellow-e- <dig> gene progenitor of mrjps may have encoded a venomous protein like the vem <dig> gene.

putative enzymes
ci- <dig> is a venom protein belonging to the lipase family . one carboxyl-esterase and two other lipases were previously identified in the venom proteome of n. vitripennis  <cit>  and a lipase activity has been found in the venom of p. hypochondriaca  <cit> . in n. vitripennis, venom lipases might participate in the alteration of host's lipid metabolism to the benefit of the developing parasitoid eggs  <cit>  and a similar function is conceivable for c. inanitus.

the partial sequence of the ci- <dig> venom protein shares 39% sequence similarity  with a zinc-dependent metalloprotease identified in the venom of p. hypochondriaca . however, ci- <dig> lacks the functional characteristic zn2+-binding motif of hexxhxxgxxh and a distal located methionine  <cit>  found in venom metalloproteinases from the parasitoid species p. hypochondriaca  <cit> , m. aethiopoides  <cit> , eulophus pennicornis  <cit>  and n. vitripennis  <cit>  . the sequence of ci- <dig> could have thus considerably diverged from an ancestral zinc-dependent metalloprotease-like protein to acquire an original function in the venom of c. inanitus.

the ci- <dig> venom protein shows significant sequence similarity to various angiotensin converting enzymes  and notably to an ace-like protein from a. mellifera  . in addition, upon western analysis with an antibody made against recombinant drosophila ace  a clear band was seen . ace is a dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidase with a broad in vitro substrate specificity that is best known, in mammals, for its role in converting inactive angiotensin i to the vasoconstrictor, angiotensin ii, and the inactivation of bradykinin  <cit> . in insects, ace-like proteins appear to have a wide tissue distribution, from embryos to adult stages  <cit>  and some have been implicated in the metabolic inactivation of neuropeptides in the central nervous system  <cit> . dani et al.  <cit>  have detected an ace-like enzymatic activity in the venom of p. hypochondriaca and have speculated that venomous ace could be involved in the processing of peptide precursors in the venom reservoir. more recently, another ace-like enzyme has also been identified in the venom of n. vitripennis  <cit> .

ci-80a, a venom protein encoded by a single transcript identified in our vgorfs database, belongs to the peptidase family c <dig>  sub-family c1a . the partial sequence of ci-80a contains two out of the four conserved residues of the active site of c1a proteases and all the residues involved in the s <dig> subsite, which is involved in specificity for the dominant substrate of papain-like cysteine proteases. interestingly, viral cystatins encoded by the genome of the bracovirus ccbv, associated with the parasitic wasp cotesia congregata, were shown to target some c1a proteases of the host m. sexta  <cit> . cathepsins and their inhibitors may play an important role, yet undetermined, in the context of host-parasitoid physiological relationships.

the ci-40a venom protein contains a partial trypsin-like serine protease domain  but displays low sequence similarities with other known proteases ). at least one of the three residues involved in the catalytic triad for serine protease  is present in the partial sequence of ci-40a. several serine protease homologs were already reported from parasitoid venoms. in the endoparasitoid c. rubecula, the venom protein vn <dig>  has been found to be a mutated serine protease acting as an inhibitor of the defensive reaction of melanization of host hemolymph  <cit> . in addition, members of the serine protease protein family were recently identified in the venom proteomes of n. vitripennis  <cit>  and p. puparum  <cit> .

the ci- <dig> protein shares significant sequence similarity with insect alpha-n-acetyl glucosaminidases  and might play a role in proteoglycan metabolism.

lectin-like venom protein
a c-type lectin domain  was found in the sequence of the ci- <dig> venom protein. the domain extends from positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the partial sequence. an immunosuppressive function has been proposed for a lectin with a similar c-type lectin domain, encoded by the genome of the bracovirus cpbv, associated with the parasitic wasp cotesia plutellae  <cit> . since parasitoid venoms and pdvs are used by the wasps to manipulate parasitized host physiology, it might not be surprising that common molecules have been selected for delivery into the host via different pathways.

csp-like and obp-like proteins
the ci-14a venom protein belongs to the a10/os-d insect pheromone-binding protein family . a high sequence similarity was observed between ci-14a and csp <dig> from a. mellifera , another member of the a10/os-d protein family. csp <dig>  is a chemosensory protein  ubiquitously expressed in adults and pre-imaginal stages of the honeybee in which it may play a role in cuticle maturation  <cit> .

ci-23b is a venom protein containing a pheromone binding protein/general-odorant binding protein  domain . homology searches revealed that ci-23b has highly diverged from known pbps and gobps. in particular, it only shows  <dig> out of the  <dig> cystein residues strictly conserved between pbps and gobps  <cit> . other obp-like venom proteins, unrelated to ci-23b, have previously been identified in the venom proteomes of a. mellifera workers and n. vitripennis females   <cit> . beside the involvement of pbps and obps in chemical communication, it is possible that in hymenoptera, some obp-like proteins fulfil other roles in relation with the venomous functions.

venom proteins similar to lethal  g <dig> isoforms
ci-48a, vem <dig> and ci-80b venom proteins share sequence similarities with members of a group of proteins similar to protein isoforms a  and b  encoded by the lethal  g <dig> gene from d. melanogaster. this group of cystein-rich proteins notably includes several venom and salivary gland proteins of unknown functions reported from various insect species  g0193). ci-80b possesses the least conserved amino acid sequence towards lethal  g <dig> isoforms suggesting it might have diverged as a virulence factor involved in host-parasite interactions, which are often characterized by a high level of divergence.

new lineage-specific proteins
in addition to ci-23a and ci- <dig> which are conserved in the venom of two chelonus species, ten c. inanitus venom proteins did not show any significant sequence similarity to known proteins . this is reminiscent of observations on twenty three venom proteins in n. vitripennis which also have no similarity to known proteins and appear to be lineage- and/or species specific  <cit> . given that chelonines are egg-larval parasitoids it is possible that new c. inanitus proteins have evolved to cope with this particular parasitic context. although they do not contain conserved domains, they may play an important role during host-parasite interaction and notably ci-14b, the second most abundant sequence of the transcriptome .

additional putative venom proteins identified from the vgorfs database
in addition to proteins identified by mass spectrometry, several ests encoding putative venom proteins were identified in our vgorfs database . five ests encoded partial sequences of at least three different hyaluronidase-like proteins that show significant sequence similarities to venom hyaluronidases described from several hymenopteran species  <cit> . one est encoded a venom allergen 5-like protein . venom allergen  <dig> proteins  are commonly found in venoms of social hymenoptera of the superfamilly vespoidea  <cit> . they belong to a wider group of proteins expressed by salivary and venom glands of distant animal species, recently gathered under the proposed term of cap proteins for "cystein-rich secretory proteins, antigen  <dig> and pathogenesis-related proteins"  <cit> . cap domain proteins are the dominant allergy-inducing toxins in hymenopteran venoms  <cit> , and a related cap protein has previously been identified from the venom of m. hyperodae  <cit> .

sequence
amino acid sequences encoded by the mentioned ests were compared to protein sequences deposited in ncbi nr database using blastp algorithm. id.: identity between the amino acid sequence deduced from a given c. inanitus transcript and the corresponding best-matched protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we report the identification of the majority of venom proteins of the egg-larval endoparasitoid wasp c. inanitus. we combined technical approaches which we had successfully used to elucidate the origin of bracoviruses  <cit> . they are powerful tools to study evolutionary and functional aspects of parasitoid-associated factors. the most highly redundant set of sequences encoded a protein  that shared sequence similarity with a venom protein previously identified in the related species c. sp. near curvimaculatus  <cit> . these venom proteins are thus likely to play a key role, as yet undetermined, in the life cycle of cheloninae egg-larval endoparasitoids. in addition, we have identified  <dig> unigenes that, for the most part, are likely to code for nonsecretory products of the venom glands.

a striking feature of c. inanitus venom was the redundancy of components able to interact with chitin. these components might be important when intermediate or late stages of eggs are parasitized. in this case, the parasitoid larva has to bore itself into the host embryo which is surrounded by an embryonic cuticle  <cit>  and chitinases might help to facilitate this process.

a number of c. inanitus venom proteins and enzymes shared similarities to venom gland products from other species that also belong to the ichneumonoidea superfamily . sequence similarities were also found with venom proteins from more distant apocritan species representative from chalcidoidea , vespoidea  and apoidea  superfamilies . the presence of related venom proteins in species that do not share the same ecological constraints and lifestyles can partly be explained by independent recruitment of these proteins during species evolution  <cit> . our phylogenetic analyses suggest this is the case for the venom chitinases of the cheloninae species and the venom chitinase  <dig> of n. vitripennis that were acquired independently. however, given that all modern apocrita share a common ancestral parasitic origin  <cit> , it is also expected that some lineages have conserved ancestral venom genes. our finding of mrna coding for a member of the allergen  <dig> proteins family in the venom glands of c. inanitus appears to be an example of such conservation. the sequence of the deduced protein is placed, with the allergen  <dig> from the venom of m. hyperodae and n. vitripennis in a monophyletic clade with respect to the phylogenetic tree of allergen  <dig> proteins found in vespid and ant venoms . this result suggests that the ancestral gene was expressed by the venom glands of the common ancestor of ichneumonoidea and aculeata,  <dig> to  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and could have been lost in apoidea. allergen  <dig> proteins would thus be representative of one of the most ancient group of insect venom proteins.

another interesting point is the discovery of a yellow-e3-like protein, vem <dig>  in the venom of c. inanitus which give more indications on the evolutionary history of the yellow-e <dig> gene family among hymenoptera. interestingly the recent genome sequencing of n. vitripennis has revealed the largest number of yellow/mrjp genes so far found in any insect, including an independent amplification of mrjp-like proteins  <cit> . it would be worthy to determine if some of these genes have a venomous function in nasonia species.

on a more general standpoint, once increasing number of comprehensive analyses will become available, our work on the venom composition of c. inanitus will contribute to retracing the evolution of venomous functions within hymenoptera by comparison of the venomous arsenal of different species.
