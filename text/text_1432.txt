BACKGROUND
β-galactosidases , which hydrolyze lactose to glucose and galactose, have two main applications in food industry, including production of low-lactose milk and dairy products for lactose intolerant people and production of galacto-oligosaccharides from lactose by the transgalactosylation reaction  <cit> . traditionally, commercial β-galactosidases are produced from fungi of the genus aspergillus and yeasts of the genus kluyveromyces <cit> . despite these β-galactosidases have outstanding lactose hydrolysis ability, they have two major drawbacks including low thermostability and high inhibition of reaction products. commonly, the optimum termperatures of these enzymes are less than 58°c  <cit> , and thus they have low stability during the high-temperature  pasteurization of milk. furthermore, these enzymes are badly inhibited in the presence of the reaction products   <cit> , and the inhibition of reaction products may lead a decrease in the reaction rates or even stop enzymatic reaction completely. these two problems can be solved using thermostable β-galactosidases with high tolerance of galactose and glucose. therefore, interests in identifying novel β-galactosidases with high thermostablility or high tolerance of galactose and glucose have been increasing in the last decade. despite some thermostable β-galactosidases have been found from thermophilic microorganisms  <cit> , and several β-galactosidases from mesophilic microorganisms with high tolerance of galactose or glucose have also been identified  <cit> , the β-galactosidases possessing simultaneously high thermostablity and tolerance of galactose and glucose are still seldom reported until now. furthermore, almost all of reported β-galactosidases are from cultured microorganisms, and little attention has been paid to β-galactosidases from unculturable microorganisms, which account for over 99% of microorganisms in the environment  <cit> . therefore, some efforts should be made to discover novel β-galactosidases with high thermostability and tolerance to reaction products from unculturable microorganisms of environment.

to discover novel biocatalyst from uncultured microorganisms in the environment, the metagenomic approach has been successfully employed in the isolation and identification of novel enzymes  <cit> . however, there are few reports on β-galactosidases obtained via metagenomic strategies up to now. recently, a novel β-galactosidase gene, zd <dig>  was isolated by screening a soil metagenomic library  <cit> . nevertheless, this enzyme was regarded as a cold-adapted β-galactosidase due to its optimal temperature of 38°c and 54% residual activity at 20°c. thus, identification of novel β-galactosidases with high thermostability and low inhibition of reaction product via metagenomic strategy is still urgently in demand.

in the present study, a metagenomic library from soil samples of turpan basin, the hottest and driest area in china, was constructed, and a novel β-galactosidase  was identified and expressed in escherichia coli . the enzymatic properties of gal <dig> with n-terminal fusion tag were investigated after purification, and this enzyme displayed several novel properties including high thermostability, high tolerance of galactose and glucose, as well as high enzymatic activity for lactose. these properties make it a good candidate in the production of low-lactose milk and dairy products after further study.

RESULTS
screening for β-galactosidase from a metagenomic library
to discover novel thermostable β-galactosidases, a metagenomic library consisting of approximately  <dig>  clones was constructed using dna extracted from soil samples of the mountain of flames of the turpan basin in china. restriction analysis of  <dig> randomly selected clones from metagenomic library indicated that 95% of clones contained inserts of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb in size, with an average size of  <dig>  kb. thus, the metagenomic library covered theoretically about  <dig>  mb of soil microbial community dna. one positive clone with bright blue color was finally identified from the metagenomic library. the activity of the positive clone was reconfirmed after retransformation, and then the plasmid of this clone was extracted and an insert of 5215 bp was sequenced. the orf-finder and blastx analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 1977 bp, which encoded a glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  protein  of  <dig> amino acids. a protein blast  search in the databases of ncbi indicated that the protein had the highest identity of 49%  with the β-galactosidase from one thermophilic microbe geobacillus thermocatenulatus, as well as a low identity of only 38%  with the β-galactosidase from the other thermophilic microbe thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum dsm  <dig>  suggesting that gal <dig> is probably a novel thermostable β-galactosidase from unculturable microorganisms. in addition, multiple sequence alignment of gal <dig> and other five homologous β-galactosidases from gh family  <dig> allowed the identification of the active site residues of gal <dig> . glu <dig>  and glu <dig>  were regarded as the catalytic residues of a typical gh- <dig> β-galactosidase  <cit> . thus, e <dig> and e <dig> , which located in two conserved regions, were thought to be the active site residues of gal <dig> based on amino acid sequence alignment and the determined structure of β-galactosidase from t. thermophilus .

heterologous expression and purification of recombinant gal308
to investigate the biochemical properties of gal <dig>  e. coli expression vector pet-32a was used to express recombinant protein under the conditions described in materials and methods. the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in ice-water bath. the cell lysate was found fully clear, and no inclusion bodies were formed, which suggested that the recombinant gal <dig> was highly soluble. then, the recombinant lac <dig> with a six-histidine tag was purified by ni-nta chromatography, and the result showed that ni-nta chromatography of cell lysate led to  <dig> -fold purification and 85% activity yield . furthermore, the purified enzyme and the crude enzyme  were applied to sds-page  together to determine the molecular mass and expression level of recombinant protein. the purified recombinant protein showed a single protein band of approximate 95 kda, higher than its calculated molecular mass , which can be ascribed to its n-terminal fusion of  <dig> amino acids  corresponding to thioredoxin tag , polyhistidine tag , s·tag epitope , and a unique thrombin cleavage site . in addition, the highest expression level of gal <dig> in e. coli was about 125 mg/l when the cell was induced at 30°c for 8 h. next, the purified gal <dig> was used to study its biochemical properties.

effect of ph and temperature on enzymatic activity and stability
the optimal ph of recombinant gal <dig> was investigated by measuring the enzymatic activity towards lactose at various ph values  and 78°c. gal <dig> displayed the highest activity at ph  <dig> . even at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , recombinant enzyme still exhibited  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the maximum activity, respectively . moreover, the enzyme was found to be stable in the ph range of  <dig>  -  <dig> , and more than 70% of the maximum activity was remained . thus, the ph properties of gal <dig> are suitable in lactose hydrolysis of natural milk . the optimal temperature for the enzyme was 78°c . the thermostability of gal <dig> was drastically decreased when the temperature was more than 80°c, and the enzyme was almost completely inactivated at 90°c . however, the enzyme was fairly stable for a temperature range of 40°c - 70°c, and its activity almost kept unchangeable after incubation for 60 min. therefore, gal <dig> is especially suitable for hydrolysis of lactose during milk pasteurization  when compared with a commercially available β-galactosidase from kluyveromyces lactis .

the effect of metal ions on enzymatic activity
following the addition of na+, k+, mn2+ and zn2+, no pronounced effect on the enzymatic activity was observed. however, the presence of 1 mm cu2+, fe3+, and al3+ caused a strong inhibition to the enzymatic activity. in addition, the existence of 1 mm mg2+ and ca2+ slightly stimulated the enzymatic activity.

substrate specificity and kinetic parameters
the substrate specificity of gal <dig> towards several chromogenic nitrophenyl analogues and its natural substrate lactose was shown in table  <dig>  the enzyme displayed high hydrolysis ability for onpg  and moderate activity for its natural substrate lactose . however, the hydrolysis ability of the enzyme towards all other chromogenic nitrophenyl analogues was very weak, indicating that gal <dig> is a β-galactosidase with narrow substrate specificity. to investigate the kinetic parameters of recombinant enzyme, the michaelis-menten constants , turnover numbers , and catalytic efficiencies  of gal <dig> for onpg and lactose were determined. the kcat and km values were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for onpg, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for lactose, respectively. the kcat/km value of the enzyme for onpg  was  <dig> -fold higher than that for lactose , which clearly demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of gal <dig> for onpg was much higher than that for lactose.

hydrolysis of lactose in milk by gal <dig> 

effects of galactose and glucose on the activity of gal308
lineweaver-burk plots  were used to investigate the effects of the inhibitors galactose and glucose on the activity of gal <dig> using onpg as substrate. the results demonstrated that both of galactose and glucose were competitive inhibitors of gal <dig> because vmax value of gal <dig> was unchangeable and km value of gal <dig> was increased with concentration enhancement of the inhibitors . furthermore, the inhibition constant  of galactose and glucose to gal <dig> were also determined. the enzyme displayed a very high tolerance of galactose and glucose, with the inhibition constants ki,gal of 238 mm and ki,glu of 1725 mm. in addition, the effects of galactose and glucose on enzymatic activity were investigated at various concentrations of galactose and glucose . comparing to the inhibition of galactose to other β-galactosidases reported previously, the inhibition of galactose to gal <dig> is less pronounced, and the relative activity of gal <dig> still reached to  <dig> % at a concentration of 400 mm galactose. on the other hand, glucose had an almost negligible inhibitory effect with  <dig> % of the initial activity remaining at a concentration of 400 mm glucose.

to investigate the lactose hydrolysis activity of gal <dig>  an experiment on lactose hydrolysis in milk was performed. after 30 min of incubation at 65°c,  <dig> % of milk lactose was hydrolyzed by gal <dig> and  <dig> % of milk lactose was hydrolyzed by the commercial enzyme. when the incubation time of gal <dig> was extended to 45 min, 60 min, the hydrolysis rate of lactose in milk was increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. compared to gal <dig>  the hydrolysis rate for lactose of the commercial enzyme was increased to  <dig> % and  <dig> % when incubation for 45 min and 60 min, respectively. these results suggest that gal <dig> has a better potential for enzyme application in low-lactose milk production than the commercial β-galactosidases.

discussion
until now, the majority of biomolecules obtained via metagenomic strategy are screened from metagenomic libraries constructed from temperate soil samples  <cit> . nevertheless, extreme environments, such as solfataric hot springs  <cit> , urania hypersaline basins  <cit> , provide an almost untapped reservoir of novel biomolecules with biotechnologically valuable properties, these environments are thereby an interesting source for novel biocatalysts that are active under extreme conditions  <cit> . recently, some metagenomic libraries derived from extreme habitats have been constructed, and most of them were used to mine novel lipases/esterases  <cit> . all these metagenome-derived esterases displayed habitat-specific properties, such as high thermostability  <cit>  or a preference for high hydrostatic pressure and salinity  <cit> . however, other enzymes except lipases/esterases obtained via metagenomic approach from extreme environments were seldom reported. in the present study, to identify novel thermostable β-galactosidases, a metagenomic library was constructed using soil samples from turpan basin of china, which was regarded as the hottest and driest area of china  function-driven screening resulted in the identification of a novel β-galactosidase with a temperature optimum of 78°c and high thermostability. to the best of our knowledge, it is the first report on thermostable β-galactosidase obtained via metagenomic strategy up to now, and it is also the first report of β-galactosidase screened from unculturable microbes of extreme environments. therefore, this study will enrich the source of β-galactosidases, and attract some attentions to β-galactosidases from extreme habitats and metagenomic library, and thus has some significance to strengthen the theoretical and application research of β-galactosidases from unculturable microbes.

in addition, a comparison of enzymatic properties of gal <dig> to other known thermostable β-galactosidases was also performed, and the result was shown in table  <dig>  gal <dig> displayed higher optimal temperature than several thermostable β-galactosidases, including bgab  <cit> , β-galactosidase from rhizomcor sp.  <cit> , bgly  <cit> , and β-galactosidase from bacillus coagulans rcs <dig>  <cit> . though some thermostable β-galactosidases had higher optimal temperature than gal <dig>  their relative enzymatic activities at 65°c  were much lower than that of gal <dig> , or were not investigated . furthermore, the ph of natural milk is about  <dig> - <dig> , and thus an ideal β-galactosidase should be optimally active at ph  <dig> - <dig> . gal <dig> displayed a more suitable ph optimum  than several thermostable β-galactosidases such as β-galactosidase from s. elviae cgs <dig>   <cit> , β-galactosidase from rhizomucor sp.   <cit> , and bgaa from thermus sp. ib- <dig>   <cit> . considering both of the relative activity at 65°c and optimal ph, only a thermostable β-galactosidase from bacillus stearothermophilus  <cit>  had similar enzymatic properties  with gal <dig> among nine known thermostable β-galactosidases. however, the specific activity of the enzyme  was much lower than that of gal <dig> , and lactose and galactose had a strong competitive inhibition effect against its activity. in addition, lactose is the natural substrate of β-galactosidase, and the higher enzymatic activity for lactose indicates the higher application potential in the food industry. gal <dig> displayed a high enzymatic activity  for lactose, which was higher than that of previously described thermostable β-galactosidases, including bgab   <cit> , bgaa  from thermus sp. ib- <dig>  <cit> , and β-galactosidase  of thermus sp. t <dig>  <cit> . however, the activity of gal <dig> for lactose was still far less than that for its synthetic substrate-onpg . similar substrate specificity had been observed in several β-galactosidase of gh  <dig> family, such as a thermostable β-galactosidase from c. saccharolyticus  <cit> , a metagenome-derived β-galactosidase  <cit> , and a β-galactosidase from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius <cit> . the results suggested that β-galactosidase from gh <dig> family had higher catalytic efficiency for onpg than that for lactose. the direct evolution work of improving the specific activity of gal <dig> towards lactose is now under study in this laboratory to obtain a more satisfying β-galactosidase for hydrolysis of lactose in milk.

finally, the reaction products inhibition by galactose and glucose is a common characteristic of β-galactosidase that limits their use in low-lactose milk production. the activity of commercially available β-galactosidase from kluyveromyces lactis is inhibited by galactose with a ki of 42 mm  <cit> , and most microbial β-galactosidases reported previously are also strongly inhibited by galactose with ki values of 3–45 mm, such as β-galactosidases from arthrobacter sp.  <cit>  and hymenaea courbaril  <cit> , although a β-glactosidase from lactobacillus reuteri  <cit>  with high galactose-tolerance have been identified  . furthermore, glucose exhibited strong inhibition to some β-galactosidases like β-galactosidase from thermus sp. t <dig>  <cit>  and β-galactosidase from s. solfataricus  <cit> . however, the inhibition of glucose to other β-galactosidases is less pronounced  <cit> , even a β-galactosidase from c. saccharolyticus displayed high glucose-tolerance with a ki value of 1170 mm  <cit> . in this study, the inhibition constant of galactose for gal <dig> was 238 mm, which is about 2-fold that for β-galactosidase from l. reuteri . on the other hand, the inhibition constant of glucose for gal <dig> was reached up to 1725 mm, which had been the highest reported inhibition constant for a β-galactosidase to date. gal <dig> with high tolerance to glucose and galactose could relieve the inhibition caused by the accumulation of glucose and galactose during the hydrolysis process of lactose, and thus improve its enzymatic activity and hydrolysis efficiency of lactose. the feature of high tolerance to galactose and glucose makes gal <dig> have obvious advantage in low-lactose milk production than those commercial β-galactosidases which were sensitive to galactose.
