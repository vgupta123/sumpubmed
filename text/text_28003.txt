BACKGROUND
in neurons, rna molecules often have to travel long distances between transcriptional origin  and functional destination . dendrites contain thousands of postsynaptic sites and long-lasting forms of activity-dependent synaptic modifications  are believed to require local protein synthesis. local protein translation implies that mrnas are transported from the nucleus and localized to dendrites and synapses  <cit> . it has been speculated that rna secondary structures in mrna untranslated regions  are involved in these processes  <cit> . in addition, numerous noncoding rnas  are expressed in brain  <cit>  and mounting evidence indicates important contributions of ncrnas in brain functions such as memory formation and maintenance  <cit> , as well as a host of other functions in mammalian cells. this study further explores these connections by combining the large scale in situ hybridization data of the allen mouse brain atlas   <cit>  with in silico predictions of conserved rna secondary structure, revealing extensive enrichment of such structures in the adult mouse brain transcriptome.

post-transcriptional regulation of rna splicing, editing, transport, stability, localization and translation through utr signals plays an important role in controlling gene expression. important examples of stable rna secondary structures are known in both 5’ utrs  <cit>  and 3’ utrs. for instance, the 84-nucleotide  long structure-anchored repression element  in ctgf <cit>  is highly conserved in structure but not in sequence, and is suspected to inhibit translation and affect mrna stability  <cit> . other structural mrna elements, such as the selenocysteine insertion sequence  element and nanos 3’ utr tce, are targets of rna binding proteins. stem-loop structures in untranslated regions are sometimes critical for proper mrna localization  <cit> , such as translocation of the mapt mrna along axonal microtubules  <cit>  and ash <dig> mrna to the cortical actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . rna binding proteins might localize the rab1a mrna to specific cytoplasmic regions through recognition of its highly conserved 3’ utr sequence and structure, so that translation would occur close to the location of the respective protein regulating intracellular vesicle transport  <cit> . a predicted stable rna structure overlaps the rna localization region in the 3’ utr of the mrna encoding myelin basic protein mbp. the structure  is conserved in human, mouse and rat  <cit> . the highest affinity site of the rna-binding protein qk <dig> is located within the rna localization region of mbp, suggesting a possible role for qk <dig> in restricting mbp mrna to the myelin membrane  <cit> . in a very distinct manner, many 3’ utrs in mouse are reported to be expressed separately from their mrnas in a developmentally regulated manner  <cit> , and some reported regulatory mutations in 3’ utrs do not appear to act in cis to regulate the expression of the associated mrna. some structured 3’ utrs may, thus, act in trans as ncrnas  <cit> .

long noncoding rnas  have recently received increased attention due to their functional diversity in basic molecular and cellular biology  <cit> . in particular, they appear to be deeply entwined with cellular regulatory machinery, both as targets of important transcription factors  <cit> , and as direct cis- and trans-regulators of gene expression through interactions with transcription factors or as indirect regulators through an rna-binding protein intermediate   <cit> . furthermore, they have demonstrated roles in regulation of dosage compensation, imprinting, chromatin state, and epigenetic inheritance by dna methylation  <cit> . a hallmark of many small ncrnas is the critical role of rna secondary  structure. rna structure also may have major functional implications for lncrnas as shown, e.g., for the noncoding co-factor meg <dig> of the tumor repressor p <dig> <cit> , and the p <dig> regulated transcriptional repressor lincrna-p <dig>  which is tethered to hnrnp-k for its proper localization  <cit> .

several genome-scale screens for stable, conserved rna secondary structures have found known rna families and many potentially novel ncrnas , albeit with significant false discovery rates  <cit> . classical transfer rnas, ribosomal rnas, some micrornas and many other functional ncrnas have a weakly conserved sequence, and instead, have a highly conserved functional secondary structure. hence, comparative analyses that focus on sequence conservation and ignore potential conservation of secondary structure underestimate ncrna prevalence. here, we apply to search for rna secondary structures. the method attempts to create structurally optimal alignments from unaligned orthologous input sequences using an expectation-maximization algorithm. both thermodynamic energies and evidence for conservation of secondary structure, e.g. presence of compensatory mutations in putative helices, are part of the evaluation criteria. an appropriate background model distinguishes between significant rna structures, e.g. putative ncrnas, and structured background.

the key question addressed in this paper is the extent to which rna structures, both in noncoding transcripts and the utrs of protein coding transcripts, play biologically important roles in the brain. we address this question by analyzing transcripts expressed in the adult mouse brain as cataloged in the allen mouse brain atlas  for their potential to contain rna structures predicted by . there are atlas probes for approximately  <dig>  rna transcripts in the adult mouse brain, visualized at cellular resolution by in situ hybridization   <cit> . of these transcripts,  <dig>  exhibit cellular expression above background in the adult mouse brain  <cit> . expression data within the ish images is identified and mapped to defined regions  <cit> . this mapped expression data can be used to examine global and spatial expression patterns and to find genes with similar spatial expression profiles. although the majority of atlas transcripts represent protein coding genes, mercer et al. <cit>  identified well over  <dig>  atlas riboprobes as putative lncrnas and affirmed the expression patterns of some previously described lncrnas, such as evf gtl2gomafu, and sox2ot.

RESULTS
structured allen mouse brain atlas riboprobes
structured allen mouse brain atlas riboprobes have rna secondary structures predicted by , are expressed above background in the adult mouse brain and are mapped to the mouse genome . we subdivided structured probes into two genomic locations:  structured  noncoding rnas  have no protein coding potential and the entire probe is intergenic or intronic, and  structured utrs are probes overlapping a utr exon annotated in ucsc or refseq gene tracks with an rna structure prediction. total numbers of expressed allen mouse brain atlas probes  are listed. detailed information about probes and structures are contained in additional file  <dig> 

by considering all annotated utrs of full-length transcripts we find many additional structures, often at the end of longer alternative utrs  <cit> . however, the expression of these variants in the brain is unknown, which is why we consider only those portions of utrs that are overlapped by atlas probes. for instance, one isoform of mouse vegf-related factor gene  lacking a 3’utr is expressed in brain  <cit> . we predict a rna structure in one alternative 3’utr of vegfb, but we annotate it as a non-structured utr because the atlas probe does not overlap the extended 3’ utr structure.

 predicts conserved rna structures in the genomic context of  <dig>  atlas riboprobes of which  <dig>  probes are expressed above background . the amount of predicted structures overlapping expressed probes is sensitive to gc content but significantly larger in all gc bins than expected by chance . we mapped the expressed structured probes to ucsc  <cit>  and refseq  <cit>  gene tracks and obtained  <dig>  probes with predicted structures in annotated untranslated regions . the predicted structures are enriched at the flanks of utrs, see figure  <dig>  in contrast,  <dig>  expressed atlas probes map to protein coding genes lacking structure predictions in their utrs. riboprobes not in annotated protein-coding genes are further examined for their protein-coding potential . excluding probes mapping to annotated coding exons and utrs, we retain  <dig> intergenic and  <dig> intronic potential ncrna transcripts that have predicted conserved local rna structures . several rna structures were found in known long ncrnas such as xist, miat, meg <dig> and mirg. almost half  of the intergenic structured ncrnas are more than  <dig> kb from the closest coding gene. known rna structures are annotated in nine putative ncrna transcripts  and  <dig> structured utrs . predicts  <dig> of these annotated rna structures, whereas the other predictions are located up- or downstream from known structures.

spatial expression energy of structured transcripts
the allen mouse brain atlas has mapped the ish expression to defined regions . to identify neuroanatomical-specific patterns of structured transcripts and to possibly gain some insight into the biological function of these transcripts, we apply a multi-resolution hierarchical search of increasing levels of granularity that starts with  <dig> neuroanatomical regions  in sagittal sections and ends with three-dimensional grids of voxels each  <dig> micron per side for both the sagittal and coronal plane  <cit> . unless stated otherwise, by structured we refer to a predicted rna structure. first, we compare the mean expression level  of expressed structured probes versus expressed non-structured probes. the comparisons were performed separately in each of the  <dig> neuroanatomical regions, and for both the putative ncrna and utr categories. expression of all expressed atlas probes was examined as well. for this analysis, we used sagittal tissue sections because sagittal data is available for all probes whereas fewer  have data in the coronal plane. in figure  <dig>  the major observations are that, first, structured utr probes overall have the highest expression in the brain, and, second, structured ncrna probes have higher expression than non-structured ncrna probes, but are less strongly expressed than the average of all probes.

the significance of the observed patterns has been tested by different statistical methods  with similar results. we addressed in which of the  <dig> neuroanatomical regions the mean expression energy of structured putative ncrna and structured utr probes is significantly different from expressed probes, intergenic and intronic, and utr probes. the most striking result is that in all  <dig> neuroanatomical regions the  <dig>  structured utr probes have significantly higher expression than  <dig>  non-structured utr probes  as well as all expressed probes. the same applies for the finer level of granularity where the  <dig> neuroanatomical regions are further subdivided into  <dig> regions. on the other hand, there is significant expression enrichment of structured putative ncrnas to non-structured ncrnas only in cerebellum .

based on these observations we conducted further analyses to gain insight towards the possible causes of the enrichment of transcripts with structured utrs. we studied significantly  enriched gene ontology  terms  <cit>  of utr probes using functional annotation by david  <cit> . we found support for function enrichment of binding , localization  and transport  in structured utr probes. several go terms for protein binding  and rna binding  are significant for probes with structured utrs , but none for non-structured utrs . in addition, we found several go terms which connect structured utr probes to intracellular signaling pathways and suggest a directed rna transport between nucleus and synapses or dendrites, e.g. the cellular components cytoplasm , nucleus  and synapse  and the molecular functions intracellular signaling cascade , protein transport , protein localization , vesicle-mediated transport  and cytoskeletal protein binding . for non-structured utr probes there are four times less enriched go terms, in general with lower significance than for structured utr probes. only the go terms cytoplasm  and transport  are enriched for non-structured utrs and are related to signaling function. localization can imply different functional impact, for example direct involvement in transport, but it can also imply translational regulation at a specific subcellular location. given the anatomy of the neurons where presumably many transcripts are located far away from the nucleus the observation of enriched expression of utr regions with  rna structures is consistent with this.

in embryonic cells it is known that the majority of localized rnas are targeted to particular cytoplasmic regions by rna elements and in mrnas these are almost always in the 3’ utr  <cit> . in brain cells our data agrees with these earlier observations in the way that 5’ utr structures alone are not correlated to the binding, transporting and localization function of their protein products. we also mapped atlas probes overlapping utrs to a list of  <dig> active proteins in synapses  <cit> . a significantly greater number of their mrnas has a structured utr  which supports a role for the utr structures as functional rna elements. another supporting observation for localized rnas with structured rna elements is their higher spatial divergence in the brain described by larger deviation of expression in  <dig> neuroanatomical regions . alternatively, spliced utr transcripts may act independently from their host mrna. however, this case cannot be verified without further examination of the probe captured transcripts.

the expression data also shows slightly higher expression of structured putative ncrna transcripts than non-structured ncrnas in many brain domains as indicated in figure  <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  mean expression of the  <dig> structured ncrna candidates is larger in  <dig> out of  <dig> brain regions. enrichment is significant in  <dig> regions  compared to  <dig> regions with significantly enriched non-structured ncrna probes using a more robust measure of location assuming dependency between multiple ish measurements .

it is essential to determine whether the presence of enriched transcripts is due to slower degradation caused by rna structures  <cit> . the delay of degradation of transcripts folding in conserved rna structures may support an increased half life of brain relevant rnas. proteins are actively synthesized in neuronal synapses despite the long distances between nucleus and synapses. for this purpose translational control of gene activity appears to be more efficient than transcriptional control  <cit> . conservation of different structures in different transcripts suggests that they are involved in a rich variety of post-transcriptional regulatory interactions, e.g. through altered transcriptional stability. combined with the previously described go analyses, this suggest that proteins involved in molecule mobility are produced in larger numbers, and mrnas and ncrnas are transported to their intended cell destination before carrying out their function.

protein binding of structured utrs
as an initial step towards assigning functional information we searched for proteins that may bind to predicted structures in utr regions. rna binding proteins are trans-acting factors that function, e.g., in rna localization. for instance, the mrna of the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase trkb receptor is transported to dendrites and translated in response to neural activity. the mouse trkb 5’ utr contains one conserved and one mouse-specific single internal ribosomal entry site  whose rna secondary structures and sequence-specific motifs are proposed to be integral to ires-dependent translation  <cit> . in agreement with this, the prediction finds the conserved ires structure in  <dig> mammals, whereas, as expected, the unconserved ires structure was not predicted. the structure consists of two stems of which the 3’ stem is the same as previously shown in human  <cit> . activity of the conserved ires is enhanced in the presence of the polypyrimidine tract binding protein ptb <dig> <cit> . in the ish data correlated expression of trkb and ptb <dig> can be seen, even though at a low level, in the olfactory bulb  and medulla  using the spatial homology search tool  <cit>  .

in comparison to non-structured utrs, a correlation-based search for similar expression pairs  results in slightly more correlated expressed pairs between transcripts coding for rna binding proteins and transcripts with structured utrs. to identify spatial and brain-wide correlations, we used pearson’s correlation coefficient greater than a threshold of ρt= <dig>  and ρt= <dig> , respectively . we identified spatial correlation between  <dig> rna binding proteins annotated in rbpdb  <cit>  and  <dig> structured utr transcripts mostly in thalamus, pallium and hippocampus , as well as brain-wide correlated expression between  <dig> rna binding proteins and  <dig> structured utr probes . we also searched for potential interaction sites of rna binding proteins around utr structures which are discussed below.

correlated expression between structured transcripts
by examining correlated expression patterns, we can hypothesize new functions for previously uncharacterized structured transcripts or identify potential interacting rna molecules as well as rna-protein interactions due to localized translation as described above. the following prediction of an annotated utr element exemplifies connectivity of functional related molecules. we predict a widely conserved   <dig> nt stem-loop in the 3’ utr of rat brain-derived neurotrophin factor bdnf. this stem-loop partly overlaps the loop and 5’ end of the annotated core region of an extended stem-loop previously predicted in the full-length utr structure   <cit> . the 3’ utr structure of bdnf provides a scaffold for interaction of various rna binding proteins, polyadenylation factors and mirnas in response to ca <dig> +  signal . the interaction results in ca <dig> + signal-dependent stabilization of mrnas in neurons  <cit> .

before studying gene pairs of correlated expression we look for groups of transcripts with structured utrs with similar expression patterns in  <dig> brain regions. high quality probes with coronal data  are clustered in modules of correlated expression  <cit> . most structured utr probes have correlated expression patterns over the entire brain with the strongest signals in the isocortex  and motor-related areas in the brain stem . the strongest spatial pattern occurs in epithalamus , followed by cerebellum , striatum  and midbrain .

 is used to study correlated expression of structured atlas probes in the entire brain. starting with high quality probes we found  <dig> structured utr transcripts with strong brain-wide expression involved in  <dig> brain-wide correlation pairs . strong spatial activity is obtained for  <dig> structured utr probes involved in  <dig>  local correlation pairs . many transcripts have correlated expression to only a small number of other transcripts . one such example is the zfp <dig> zinc finger protein which is brain-wide correlated expressed to 6530418l21rik , the signal transduction protein chn <dig>  and a230097p14rik* , whose mrnas have highly conserved 3’ utr structures. representative ish images of some correlated probes are shown in figure  <dig> 

sagittal image data was included for correlation pair analysis of ncrnas. of  <dig> putative ncrnas,  <dig> show strong brain-wide correlated expression in  <dig> correlation pairs  including  <dig> structured ncrna candidates . most of these transcripts are involved in small cliques of correlated expression, see figure  <dig>  additional file 2: figure s <dig> shows representative ish images of the non-coding myocardial infarction associated transcript a230057g18rik  and its correlated expressed transcripts. more often ncrna correlated expression appears in restricted brain domains rather than brain-wide. mostly small cliques of correlated expressed transcripts are found for  <dig> ncrnas  including  <dig> structured ncrna candidates involved in  <dig> correlation pairs . spatial correlation patterns also exist for known micrornas and snornas targeted by intergenic riboprobes. for instance, mir-101a, which is encompassed by ak <dig> , has correlated expression in hindbrain  and pons, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> which are encompassed by mirg are expressed brain-wide with regional covariance in pons  and hippocampus , and the aca <dig> snorna hosting transcript mcg <dig> is correlated to mtnr1b in the thalamus.

thermodynamic stable rna-rna interactions
many known ncrnas exhibit their functionality through binding of rna target sequences, such as micrornas bind mrnas, snornas bind ribosomal and small nuclear rnas, and certain lncrnas may bind micrornas  <cit>  to regulate their activity or guide rna editing. potential rna-rna interactions between structured transcripts and correlated expressed rnas were searched by scanning all putative ncrnas and utrs of atlas transcripts for statistically significant intermolecular rna binding sites. by combining  <cit>  and  <cit>  we calculate the minimum free energy  of putative interaction sites in the real data, and the same strategy was used to create background distributions on dinucleotide shuffled data for p-value calculation .

for  <dig> putative ncrnas with local and  <dig> putative ncrnas with brain-wide correlated expression we found putative interaction sites to 3’ or 5’ utr of the correlated mrnas, however, of relatively large p-values . for instance, a non-conserved interaction site is predicted between the putative ncrna tc <dig> and the 3’ utr of kcnb <dig> . the putative ncrna loc <dig> may interact with a conserved region in the 3’ utr of gpx <dig>  only  <dig> nt upstream of the common stem-loop structure secis . in addition, around  <dig> significant  interaction sites with a mfe smaller than - <dig> kcal/mol are predicted by and between structured putative ncrnas and, e.g., utrs of mrnas coding for rna binding proteins , but the ish data does not reveal correlated expression.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
microarray studies have shown that at least 50% of assayed transcripts are expressed in the brain  <cit> , with up to 80% of transcripts shown to be expressed by ish  <cit> . in order to gain a better understanding of transcripts in the brain that may be contributing to brain function, we examined which transcripts have an rna structure. we observed that in silico predicted rna structures are enriched both in coding  as well as noncoding transcripts in almost all regions of the adult mouse brain. the simplest interpretation of the data is that the atlas probes showing higher expression are enriched for predicted rna structures. through the integration of mouse brain expression data and secondary rna structure predictions, we found that transcripts with such predictions in their utrs, those that are enriched in the 3’ utr adjacent to the orf, have the highest expression throughout the brain. many of these mrnas as well as their protein products may act as signaling molecules whereas the utr structures serve as binding motifs for other rnas and proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways. this hypothesis is supported by  enriched gene ontology terms binding, transport and localization,  correlated expression patterns between mrnas with structured utrs and rna binding proteins, and  a larger expression diversity of transcripts with structured utrs. utr structures as signal for motor-driven transport and translational repression through rna binding proteins are especially attractive in neurons where the transport of information stored in ribonucleic sequences from the nucleus through long axons to the synapses is an important component of neuronal functionality  <cit> .

we investigated this hypothesis further by searching for potential protein binding motifs around  utr structures to  <dig> rna binding proteins annotated in rbpdb  <cit>  . the majority  of the utr structures has at least one predicted binding motif in its neighborhood . these motifs can be bound by  <dig> proteins. only  <dig> proteins, however, have significantly more predicted targets than expected by chance, and half of the binding proteins are involved in splice site regulation. the analysis indicates that some interesting binding motifs can be found, such as neural-specific elavl <dig>  cytokine’s degrading zfp <dig>  and mrna trafficking khsrp. zfp <dig> binds au-rich elements  in the 3’ utr of some cytokine mrnas and promotes their degradation. intriguingly, an au-rich region  starts at the 3’ end of the predicted utr structure of 6530418l21rik  and its expression is highly correlated with that of another zinc finger protein  and lancl <dig>  an rna binding protein involved in immune surveillance of the brain  <cit>  . assuming that 6530418l21rik works as a signaling molecule, its transport function may be deactivated through the binding of zfp <dig> close to its 3’ utr structure. however, here a large scale investigation in rna-protein binding is still limited due to the low information content of binding motifs described by short sequence-based position weight matrices .

motivated by the go analysis we also considered the hypothesis that structured rnas in neural cells are themselves involved in establishing intracellular signaling pathways. for instance, dienstbier et al. <cit>  provide evidence that egalitarian  and the dynein cofactor bicaudal d , previously known to be required for minus-end-directed mrna transport, mediate linkage of various mrnas to the dynein motor in drosophila melanogaster. here, we show that egl nine homolog  <dig> and bicd have predicted utr structures, bicd is associated with the go terms intramolecular, cytoplasm, localization, transport and binding and egl with the go term binding. proteins, such as egl, bicd and cytoskeletal protein filaments, are needed to establish intracellular pathways for directed cytoplasmic rna transport towards synapses and dendrites. for signal propagation in the opposite direction back to the nucleus, mrnas coding for these proteins have to be transported first and, thus, need cis-acting rna elements too. the hypothesized directed rna transport is illustrated in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

we also looked for predicted rna structures in all ucsc and refseq annotated utrs of protein coding genes overlapped by atlas probes. we found  <dig>  of these genes with rna structure predictions in their utrs and  <dig>  without utr structures. of the  <dig>  atlas probes that overlap unstructured utrs,  <dig>  probes have a structure elsewhere in  the utr. it is unknown whether these structures are present in brain. assuming they are, i.e., reclassifying as “structured” some of the utr probes previously classified as “unstructured”, we see even larger differences between the expression of structured and non-structured utr probes . hence, we conclude that our overall statistics also hold for rna structure annotation in full-length transcripts. in addition, we showed that putative ncrnas with locally predicted rna structures have significantly higher expression than non-structured intergenic and intronic transcripts in several brain regions. positive correlated expression patterns between pairs of transcripts are often domain-specific for putative structured ncrnas. most promising are  <dig> ncrnas with brain-wide correlated expression in small cliques , and several ncrnas with only one spatially correlated expressed transcript. we investigated conditions where rna structure has a function, such as rna-rna interactions between correlated expressed rna transcripts. one of the applied methods in this study, e.g., predicts the interaction site of two sequences. however, it is known from rna motif searches that short sequence motifs can often appear by chance which partly explains the large p-values for the predicted rna-rna interactions. consideration of homologous sequences in other species and duplex folding by using tools such as  <cit>  may help to obtain more significant predictions.

a major uncertainty is the limited resolution of the informatics detection of expression in the ish images and, thus, the correlation data. several cells comprise a single voxel leading to interpolation between expression information and noisy expression energy. sagittal images are more impacted by registration errors since only a single hemisphere is available for registration. the majority of correlation pairs detected in the sagittal plane failed validation by manual inspection of the ish images . the largest cliques of correlated expression are often because of process artifacts in the images or the absence of expression . one desirable quality improvement of the correlation data is the weighted consideration of the voxel neighborhood which would improve the confidence in correlated expressed pairs by sacrificing some level of detail. furthermore, the data might also be interesting for graph theoretical analyses on gene expression correlation networks. features of these networks are relatively unknown and the correlation coefficient threshold could be more sophistically chosen by analyzing its influence on network connectivity. the large number of 3’ utr probes might also target ncrnas, in addition to the untranslated region of mrnas. in several specific cases we observed highly correlated brain-wide expression, e.g., between the 3’ utr probe kcnc <dig> and its intronic mcg <dig>  and between dusp <dig> and its downstream-sense located structured probe tc <dig>  but these probe pairs may have bound the same  transcript. thus, conclusions about correlated expression of adjacent or overlapping transcripts are hardly possible, especially if they have widespread expression throughout the brain.

an additional concern is that the observed correlation between structure and expression level might be an artifact of rna degradation. all exonucleases have problems initiating degradation close to stable stem structures  <cit> . hence, the abundant enrichment of transcripts hosting rna structures may be at least partly explained by their slower degradation and, thus, higher accessibility to riboprobes compared to transcripts lacking rna structure. in fact, if the structures are involved in translational regulation, reduced degradation is just as effective as increased transcription in terms of raising steady-state transcript levels. thus, to determine when e.g., a bound protein primarily serves to regulate or primarily serves to prevent degradation seems hard, in particular if preventing degradation is part of the regulatory mechanisms as is the case with the iron metabolism in vertebrates  <cit> . however, the observed enrichment of transcripts with structured utrs is not related to a particular structure, hence, it is unlikely that a particular rna binding protein that promotes transcript stability by binding to a specific structured rna motif is responsible for the broad expression pattern.

a final concern is that our results might be explained by a difference in the hybridization efficiency of atlas probes towards structured versus unstructured transcripts. hybridization is affected by a variety of factors, such as probe accessibility and affinity to the targeted molecule. for short oligos, although there are some contexts in which hybridization may be enhanced by appropriate rna structures  <cit> , it is most often suggested that highly structured regions in a target transcript would reduce hybridization efficiency. many riboswitches, for example, down-regulate translation by sequestering the ribosome binding site in a structure that blocks interaction with the 16s rrna  <cit> . this evidence suggests that structured target molecules would generate a decreased signal, but we observed an increase. in addition, atlas probes were chosen to be 400- <dig> bases in length. for such long probes that are perfectly complementary to their targets, the fully hybridized “double helix” will be the most energetically favorable state and seems likely to form easily from a simple initial toe-hold/zipper extension interaction from almost any initial conformation of the target. thus, on balance, it does not seem likely that riboprobe affinity to structured versus unstructured transcripts explains the observed enrichment of structured transcripts.

overall, our results show a huge potential for rna structure as an abundant and active feature on both coding and noncoding transcripts in the adult mouse brain. using we predicted more than  <dig>  rna structures  in about  <dig>  expressed atlas probes in the adult mouse brain. even though in silico methods for rna structure prediction hold high false positive rates of up to 50%  <cit>  our findings still leave room for functional rna structures in the atlas transcriptome data. the significantly enriched expression energy of structured transcripts is hard to explain by chance and supports the theme of functional rna structures in the mouse brain. in the future, a structure analysis remains to be carried out on a global transcriptome data set in the adult mouse brain because the atlas data primarily focus on protein-coding transcripts and has limited data on noncoding transcripts.
