BACKGROUND
rnase a ribonucleases are vertebrate proteins with unique tertiary structure and specific enzymatic activity  <cit> . bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, or rnase a, is the prototype and founding member of this family, which includes enzymatically-active proteins from humans, multiple mammalian species, birds, and vertebrate fish  <cit> . initial publication of the complete sequence of the human genome led to the discovery of several highly divergent orthologs of rnase a  that seemed to have lost elements crucial for enzymatic activity  <cit> . even among the more prototypical rnase a ribonucleases, such as eosinophil cationic protein  and avian leukocyte rnase a- <dig>  ribonuclease activity is not an essential component of their prominent antimicrobial properties  <cit> . these and related findings have suggest that active evolutionary constraints may not be directed toward maintaining optimal levels of enzymatic activity, and that the rnase a genes themselves may actually be serving more as evolutionary scaffolds, the genetic raw material for ongoing diversification  <cit> . examples of this concept include the functional compartmentalization of the digestive ribonucleases rnase  <dig> and 1b of herbivorous primate, douc langur  <cit> ; the species-limited duplication of bovine rnase a leading to bovine seminal rnase  <cit> ; the identification of multiple rodent rnase  <dig> clusters  <cit> ; and the dramatic and extensive diversification of both primate and rodent eosinophil ribonucleases  <cit> .

rnases  <dig> and  <dig> are among the more recently discovered of the rnase a ribonucleases. rnase  <dig> was described by harder and schröeder  <cit>  as an antimicrobial protein from human skin and also by zhang and colleagues  <cit>  who located the rnase  <dig> open reading frame in the first draft release of the human genome sequence. rnase  <dig> is expressed in primary keratinocytes in response to proinflammatory stimuli  <cit> , has dramatic activity against numerous bacterial and some fungal pathogens  <cit> , and has been associated with several cutaneous disease states  <cit> . in contrast to the arginine-rich antimicrobial rnases ecp and leukocyte rnase a- <dig>  rnase  <dig> is cationic due to an abundance of lysine residues. huang and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that multiple lysines interact with the bacterial membrane to promote antimicrobial activity; recently, p. aeruginosa outer membrane protein  <dig> has also been documented as a specific target  <cit> . rnase  <dig> coding sequences have been identified in recent releases of the chimpanzee  and macaque  genomes, at 99% and 93% encoded amino acid sequence identities to the human rnase  <dig>  respectively. there is no ortholog of rnase  <dig> in the mouse genome.

human rnase  <dig> was also identified as an open reading frame in the first release of the human genome sequence  <cit> . in our original report, we noted that rnase  <dig> was not as cationic as rnase  <dig>  and had an atypical cysteine structure later shown by zhang  <cit>  to have evolved by a gain-and-loss, or disulfide shuffling mechanism. we evaluated rnase  <dig> sequences from  <dig> primate species, and found several examples in which otherwise full length sequences encoded alterations in elements essential to ribonuclease structure and/or activity, a feature we termed "functional pseudogenes"  <cit> . this finding appears to be unique to rnase 8; no evidence of functional pseudogenization has emerged in similar studies of the eosinophil ribonucleases, angiogenin, or rnase  <dig>  <cit> .

given this unusual pattern of diversification, we questioned whether we might detect similar pseudogenized alleles of rnase  <dig> within the human population. we explored this possibility by isolating and sequencing coding alleles from characterized panels of genomic dna from diverse human sources. here we present our findings on the genetic diversity of human rnase  <dig>  equally interesting, we present a novel and previously unrecognized distal translational start site encoded within the transcript, which has prompted us to reconsider rnase  <dig> expression and function.

RESULTS
expression of rnase  <dig> in human tissues
expression of rnase  <dig> in adult and fetal human tissue was evaluated by qrt-pcr figure 1a and 1b using standard curves for quantitative determination of absolute copy number of both rnase  <dig> and the expression control, gapdh . as shown, expression of rnase  <dig>  was relatively low in all tissues evaluated. even at its most abundant, in adult human spleen, we detected  <dig> copy of rnase  <dig> to every  <dig> copies of gapdh; expression in other cells and tissues was substantially lower. interestingly, our previous examination of rnase  <dig> by northern analysis suggested that prominent expression was limited to placental tissue. the reasons underlying the discrepancy between these two sets of results remains unclear, but are likely related to methodology. quantitative rt-pcr is a more sensitive and specific means for detection of gene expression. the method featured here has undergone careful development and cross-reaction specifically with human rnase  <dig> has been ruled out . as the target tissues are from commercial suppliers, and the northern blot featured in the earlier publication was utilized for studies carried out nearly ten years ago  <cit> , it is not possible to do a direct comparison at this time.

the coding sequence of human rnase  <dig> includes two snps and an extended amino terminus
a  <dig> bp open reading frame including a hydrophobic sequence  preceding the ribonuclease domain  was originally identified in the human genome as rnase  <dig> based on its direct sequence homology with human rnase  <dig>  <cit> . in this work, we re-examined this locus, and we identified an extended open reading frame which includes a distal translational start site and a segment encoding an additional  <dig> amino acids preceding the original amino terminus figure 2a. this extended  <dig> bp open reading frame was identified in sequences isolated from  <dig> independent samples of human genomic dna, providing  <dig> unique alleles for analysis. all alleles encoded complete open reading frames without frameshift mutations or premature stop codons. no changes were detected in elements necessary for enzymatic activity , although one allele from one individual included a polymorphism/mutation that resulted in a c <dig> /r . this would be a structurally-destabilizing mutation in a typical rnase a family ribonuclease; however, given unusual amino terminus encoded by the complete open reading frame within the rnase  <dig> transcript , it is not at all clear what the impact of this polymorphism might be on its final conformation.

two non-silent snps were identified within the extended rnase  <dig> coding sequence. one snp  results in alternating s-30/l within the extended amino terminal sequence; the second snp  alters the sequence of the hydrophobic segment, s- <dig> /p . other than the aforementioned, previously unreported single allele , there were no snps identified in the ribonuclease domain of rnase  <dig>  the predominant s-30s- <dig> variant accounts for 54% of the alleles examined; the remaining variants constitute 17% , 11% , and 18%  of the total figure 2b. nucleotide sequence diversity was calculated at π =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per site.

characterization of the transcripts encoding human rnase 8
transcripts encoding rnase  <dig> were detected in and amplified from human spleen cdna using the rapid amplification of cdna ends  method figure 3a. the ~ <dig> bp and ~ <dig> bp sequences amplified the full coding sequence of rnase  <dig>  including sequence encoding the 5' amino terminal sequence including the distal start site; no introns were detected. to confirm the presence of the amino terminal extension and to rule out the possibility of genomic contaminants in the commercial cdna preparation, we created new 5'→ 3' primers based on cdna sequence determined from race together with known 3'→ 5' primers table  <dig> to carry out nested rt-pcr targeting both human placenta and spleen poly a+ rna figures 3b and 3c. this experimental trial  documented expression of rnase  <dig> transcript in these tissues and likewise amplified the full open reading frame including the amino terminal extension figure 3c.

extended amino termini in primate rnase 8s
extended amino terminal sequences were identified in the open reading frames of rnase 8s from five higher primate species figure 4a. hydrophobicity score vs. amino acid position  indicates that this segment  is relatively hydrophilic, particularly in comparison to the hydrophobic segment that follows , although the multiple leucine substitutions in the p. hamadryas and m. mulatta sequences render this region somewhat less hydrophilic than the featured human sequence. overall, however, the presence of this amino terminal sequence indicates that the encoded rnase  <dig> polypeptide may be structurally atypical among rnase a family members, as this configuration is not one of a classic secretory mediator .

characterization of the two translational start sites
as shown in figure  <dig>  the full-length rnase  <dig> transcript encodes both proximal  and distal  translational start sites. the proximal is in a position that is typical for rnase a family ribonucleases, as it leads what would otherwise be a hydrophobic signal sequence; its nucleotide sequence is within a reasonable approximation of a consensus translation initiation sequence. in contrast, the distal translational start site is atypical and requires functional assessment. toward this end, we utilized one or both translational start sites to direct synthesis of recombinant rnase  <dig> in cos- <dig> cells figure  <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr analysis indicated that all mrnas were transcribed and stable in cos- <dig> cells, with ct values between  <dig> and  <dig> . as anticipated, the rnase  <dig> proximal translational start site viable and active . the distal start site alone  was likewise active. interestingly, the construct that directly replicates the configuration of the natural transcript , and includes both the distal and the proximal translational start sites, promotes expression of rnase  <dig> protein over background, albeit at a reduced level.

discussion
rnase  <dig> is closely related to rnase  <dig>  but it is clearly subject to different evolutionary constraints. rnase  <dig> is a prototypical rnase a ribonuclease, as it is enzymatically active against standard rna substrates, includes an h -k- h catalytic triad, and eight canonically-spaced cysteines that generate disulfide bonds that define the tertiary structure  <cit> . although no formal evolutionary analysis has been performed on the rnase  <dig> lineage, a comparison of available coding sequences from human and genome builds of chimpanzee and macaque  <cit>  suggests that this lineage is highly conserved over time. in contrast, in an earlier study of rnase  <dig>  we documented substantial interspecies divergence , and we noted the existence of true pseudogenes, with significant truncations in encoded polypeptides in the genomes of several higher primates, including gorilla  and baboon . we also identified rnase  <dig> functional pseudogenes; these were genes that encoded full length rnase  <dig> polypeptides but with mutations in crucial structural or catalytic residues  <cit> . examples include rnase 8s from the tamarin , in which the first catalytic histidine  is mutated to aspartic acid , and likewise the african green monkey , in which a structural cysteine is lost. we embarked on the present study in large part to determine whether alleles encoding pseudogenes  might be circulating within the human population. interestingly, although detected in only one human allele among those in our study, we did identify a c37/r polymorphism similar to that found in the c. aethiops gene. aside from that one isolate, only two main snps were identified within the coding sequence of rnase  <dig>  and although the nucleotide sequence diversity was somewhat greater than that observed for rnase  <dig> , the value calculated for rnase  <dig>  π =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  per site, is within the normal range for nuclear genes  <cit> , and is similar to values determined for the functional eosinophils rnases, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin  and eosinophil cationic protein   <cit> .

however, perhaps most intriguing of all is the elucidation of the distal translational start site and putative extended open reading frame of rnase 8; the original start site was identified based on sequence homology to rnase  <dig>  <cit>  and other rnase a family ribonucleases. this amino terminal extension is unique and breaks the paradigm for the prototypical rnase a ribonucleases, which, as a group, are granule and/or secretory proteins, with amino terminal hydrophobic signal sequences that direct the nascent polypeptides through the er/golgi for post-translational processing prior to release  <cit> . in contrast to the hydrophobic quality of amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> figure 5b, the amino terminus that includes amino acids 1- <dig>  has a predominantly hydrophilic nature. as such, rnase  <dig> with this extension may not be a secretory protein. unfortunately, despite significant effort and a recently developed specific anti-peptide antibody, we have been unable to detect expression of rnase  <dig> polypeptide in human fibroblast or hematopoietic cell lines. this may be due to the fact that expression levels at homeostasis are quite low figure  <dig> and the appropriate conditions under which expression is augmented are not yet clear. consistent with this finding, we have found that the natural construct, which includes the distal translational start site in tandem with the proximal translational start site, promotes only minimally activity figure  <dig>  the absence of an rnase  <dig> ortholog in laboratory rodent models adds to the limitations we are confronting.

CONCLUSIONS
given these observations, taken together with our recent appreciation of the rnase a ribonuclease genes as scaffolds for evolutionary change  <cit> , it is apparent that we need to consider the possibility that rnase  <dig> is expressed as something other than a standard secretory ribonuclease; by extension, we need to revise the concept of functional pseudogenes. it is conceivable that rnase  <dig> is under constraints promoting selection of a novel function, perhaps only partially-related to its original role; as such, rigid adherence to the structure that is required for enzymatic cleavage of polymeric rna is no longer necessary or useful. this and related hypotheses certainly merit further consideration.
