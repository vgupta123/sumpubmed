BACKGROUND
brucellosis is one of the most important bacterial zoonoses worldwide  <cit> . brucella melitensis is the main etiological agent of sheep and goats, and human brucellosis  <cit> . in control programs of brucellosis, practical solutions for diagnosis of the disease require inexpensive, simple, rapid and specific test to identify the infected animals  <cit> . therefore, an indirect diagnosis approach of brucellosis using serological methods mainly rose bengal plate test , complement fixation test  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  are recommended for large-scale surveillance and/or eradication purposes  <cit> . these tests usually use s-lps, part of s-lps or whole cells as an antigen to detect antibodies to smooth brucella spp. which could give false positive serological reactions  results due to difficulties to differentiate between animals vaccinated with b. melitensis rev. <dig> strain and infected animals . another reason which can lead to fpsr is cross-reactivity with other gram-negative bacteria like yersinia enterocolitica o: <dig>  salmonella spp. and escherichia coli  <cit> .

the outer membrane proteins  of brucella spp. were found to be attractive alternative antigens rather than s-lps for serological diagnosis to minimize the fpsr  <cit> . brucella omps are grouped according to their apparent molecular weights as group  <dig> , group  <dig> , and group  <dig> . group  <dig> was identified as minor whereas group  <dig> and  <dig> omps were identified as major omps  <cit> . group  <dig> major omps have been approved to be useful for the differentiation of antibody responses between naturally infected animals and rev. <dig> vaccinated animals  <cit> . two genes were identified for the group  <dig> proteins of brucella and were named omp <dig> and omp <dig>  coding for 25– <dig> and 31–34 kda major omps, respectively  <cit> . in addition, omp <dig> of b. melitensis has been identified as another member of group  <dig> omps which is coded by omp <dig> gene  <cit> . others reported that omp <dig> is a cytosoluble 28 kda protein  which is localized in the periplasm  <cit> , or 26 kda periplasmic protein  which is coded by bp <dig> gene  <cit> . several individual omp genes have been cloned and their expressed proteins were tested in immunoenzymatic assays for serodiagnosis of brucellosis in animals like recombinant omp <dig>  <cit> , recombinant omp <dig>  <cit>  and recombinant omp <dig>  <cit> . however, lack of sensitivity to detect antibodies against the desired romp was the main obstacle facing these recombinant proteins. for that reason, combination of more than one recombinant protein in a single immunoenzymatic test could increase the sensitivity  <cit> .

small laboratory animals are frequently employed as models in brucellosis research  <cit> . among them, balb/c mice, has been extensively used in brucellosis research for many years mainly due to economic and practical reasons . in addition the well-known biology of this murine species, especially the humoral and cellular immunity, makes it the ideal model for brucellosis research  <cit> .

accordingly, this study aimed to describe the expression and purification of three recombinant proteins, romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig>  of b. melitensis using e. coli expression system. the produced recombinant proteins were combined and used as one coating antigen in an indirect elisa  to evaluate its differential serodiagnosis using mouse mode.

sds-page analysis and immunoreativity of recombinant fusion proteins
the majority of the expressed romp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> were found in the soluble fraction. therefore, the expressed proteins were extracted and purified under native conditions. approximately final concentration of 50 μg/ml purified recombinant protein could be achieved. the sds-page analysis showed the presence of the expected 42 k, 45 kda and da 48 kda of purified recombinant fusion proteins . the results of western immunoblot analysis revealed the immunoreactivity of purified romp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> with the three types of antibodies; two types of monoclonal antibodies , in addition to rabbit polyclonal antibodies against b. melitensis strain  <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis by sds–page of romp <dig> fusion protein. lane m, protein marker; lane  <dig>  soluble cell proteins of e. coli bl <dig> cells with recombinant omp <dig> before induction; lane  <dig>  soluble cell proteins of e. coli bl <dig> cells with recombinant omp <dig> after autoinduction; lane  <dig>  romp <dig> fusion protein  purified by affinity purification

rose bengal plate test
the rbpt gave positive results for the tested sera of the three groups of mice, and it was unable to differentiate the antibody response among these groups. however, the rbpt results showed that the mice in group  <dig>  were able to elicit high titers of anti-brucella antibodies due to infection with brucella melitensis strain  <dig> and peaked 1100 iu/ml at day  <dig>  while, the mice in group  <dig>  were able to elicit lower titers of antibodies due to vaccination with b. melitensis rev. <dig> strain, and peaked 900 iu/ml at day  <dig>  no significant differences  were found between group  <dig> and group  <dig> and this due to inability of rbpt to differentiate between the mice vaccinated with b. melitensis rev. <dig> strain and those infected with b. melitensis strain  <dig>  although the mice in group  <dig>  developed too low titers of antibodies due to infection with y. enterocolitica o: <dig> , the rbpt was able to detect these cross reacting antibodies .fig.  <dig> antibodies titer of mice sera using semi-quantitative rbpt. group  <dig>  mice infected with b. melitensis strain 0331; group  <dig>  mice vaccinated with b. melitensis rev.  <dig> vaccine strain; group  <dig>  mice infected with y. enterocolitica o:9;  negative control, mice injected with pbs. ±se at 95 % ci



recombinant omps i-elisa
all mice sera in three groups of mice and negative control were tested by i-elisa using romps as coating antigen. using the receiver operating characteristics , a cut-off value of the positivity percent  ≥  <dig>  was considered positive for brucellosis by romps i-elisa. the romps i-elisa results showed that antibodies against romps was elicited as early as day  <dig>  and reach the peak at day  <dig>  in group <dig>  while low antibody titers were detected in both group  <dig> and group  <dig> and recorded  at day  <dig>  and  at day  <dig>  respectively . tukey’s test analysis of pp values indicated the presence of significant difference  between group  <dig> and each of group  <dig> and group  <dig>  moreover, by testing sera from mice infected with b. melitensis strain  <dig>  the results of romps i-elisa recorded 100 % sensitivity . when sera from mice vaccinated with b. melitensis rev. <dig> vaccine strain was tested by romps i-elisa, 100 % specificity  was recorded. additionally, 100 % specificity  was recorded when sera from mice infected with y. enterocolitica o: <dig> were tested by romps i-elisa.fig.  <dig> percentage of positivity  values of the sera from three groups of mice tested using in-house romps i-elisa. group  <dig>  mice infected with b. melitensis strain 0331; group  <dig>  mice vaccinated with b. melitensis rev.  <dig> vaccine strain; group  <dig>  mice infected with y. enterocolitica o:9;  negative control, mice injected with pbs. ±se at 95 % ci



discussion
in this study, romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> have been successfully produced and used together to develop romps i-elisa in a hope to increase the sensitivity of the developed test for differential serodiagnosis of brucellosis using mouse model. the isolation, cloning and expression of b. melitensis strain  <dig> omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> genes were achieved using prokaryotic system pet- <dig> ek/lic. using bioedit sequence alignment editor software, the dna sequencing results confirm that omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> genes had correct orientation, and they were in the open reading frame , which in turn enable full amino acids translation of these genes in the subsequent steps. the results of blastn alignment showed that omp <dig> has 99 % identity with published sequence of b. melitensis 16 m reference strain which is due to the difference in nucleotide number  <dig>  which is c instead of t  <cit> . in order to show whether this nucleotide difference resulting in differences in the amino acids sequence, the alignment of amino acids was performed. the result showed that the nucleotide difference at number  <dig> in the omp <dig> did not cause any differences in the translation of the amino acid glycine . while, the omp <dig> and omp <dig> obtained 100 % identity with published sequence of b. melitensis 16 m reference strain  <cit>  and  <cit>  respectively. using amino acid composition feature of bioedit software, the predicted molecular weight of the tagged fused proteins was estimated to be 17 kda. in addition, the amino acids of omp <dig>  omp <dig> and omp <dig> were also analyzed.

the sds-page analysis reveals the presence of protein bands of purified romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> with molecular weight of  <dig>   <dig> and 48 kda respectively. these sizes were agreed with the theoretically molecular weights prediction of the expressed romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> fusion proteins respectively. moreover, the results of this study agreed with results obtained by letesson, et al.  <cit>  and de wergifosse, et al.  <cit>  for the romp <dig>  and gupta, et al.  <cit>  and seco-mediavilla, et al.  <cit>  for the romp <dig>  and vizcaino, et al.  <cit>  and gupta, et al.  <cit>  for the romp <dig>  furthermore, western immunoblotting analysis revealed that the romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> fusion proteins were detected by his.tag and s.tag monoclonal antibodies. additional conformation was made using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against brucella melitensis strain  <dig> to assure the immunogenicity of the romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> fusion proteins, which in turn indicate that these recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in soluble and active form.

the purified romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> were combined together and named romps. therefore, mouse model was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of romps i-elisa. accordingly, three groups of mice were set in this study. the first group was infected with b. melitensis strain  <dig> to demonstrate the antibody response due to infection with b. melitensis field strain. while the second group was injected with b. melitensis rev. <dig> vaccine strain, to demonstrate the antibody response due to vaccination, and the third group was infected with y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  to demonstrate cross reacting antibodies. antibodies in sera of all mice in the first and second groups were detected using rbpt as early as 15 days after infection, and peaked at 35– <dig> days, while the sera from mice in the third group showed a much lower antibody reactivity using rbpt. according to oie, the rbpt is considered as reference test for serological diagnosis of brucellosis. however, the inability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals are the main problem facing rbpt because it is based on detection of antibody to s-lps that is immunodominant in the serological responses of both infected and vaccinated animals  <cit> . although low antibodies titer was elicited in group  <dig>  the rbpt was able to detect cross reacting antibodies because of smooth brucella strains share common epitopes on the o-ps with cross-reacting bacteria mainly y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  <cit> , and in less extent, the natural infection by a number of other gram negative bacteria can also produce cross reacting antibodies, mainly, e. coli o: <dig> and salmonella spp.  <cit> . the results of romps i-elisa, testing sera from three groups of mice, clearly indicated the presence of significant differences between group  <dig> and each of group  <dig> and group  <dig>  and this due to ability of romps i-elisa to detect anti-omp <dig>  anti-omp <dig> or antiomp <dig> antibodies in mice infected with b. melitensis strain  <dig> rather than mice vaccinated with b. melitensis rev.  <dig> vaccine strain or infected with y. enterocolitica o: <dig>  earlier studies showed greater accessibility of omp <dig> omp <dig> and omp <dig> epitopes to antibodies generated due to infection with b. melitensis  <cit> . however, previously developed elisa based on single omp was challenging due to low sensitivity recorded, like romp <dig>   <cit>  and romp <dig>   <cit> . in our study, the romps i-elisa recorded 100 % sensitivity , means that all the mice infected with b. melitensis strain  <dig> were recognized as positive by our developed elisa. additionally, the romps i-elisa recorded 100 % specificity , means that all mice vaccinated with rev.  <dig> vaccine strain or infected with y. enterocolitica o: <dig> were recognized as negative.

in summary, in this study, the developed romps i-elisa was able to increase the sensitivity to detect the infected animals. moreover, it was also able to differentiate the animals with fpsr. these findings suggesting that romps i-elisa has potential diagnostic properties which could be used as an effective tool in the differential serodiagnosis of brucellosis.

CONCLUSIONS
combination of romp <dig>  romp <dig> and romp <dig> together clearly increased the sensitivity of the developed romps i-elisa. in addition, the results also indicated that the romps i-elisa has the ability to detect specific omp antibodies due to infection with b. melitensis strain  <dig> rather than vaccinal or cross reacting antibodies, and this means it has the ability to differentiate between infection with b. melitensis and fpsr. however, these result reflect the strict controlled conditions of our study, further evaluations should be performed which involves testing of the developed romps i-elisa in sheep and goats, as real hosts of b. melitensis, to achieve a definitive conclusion about its usefulness in differentiation of fpsr in the serological diagnosis of brucellosis.
