BACKGROUND
preeclampsia is one of the most frequently encountered medical complication of pregnancy and affects 3-5 % of pregnant women worldwide  <cit> . preeclampsia is typically characterized by new-onset hypertension, proteinuria and other systemic disturbances in the second half of pregnancy, during labor, or in the early period after delivery  <cit> , and it confers adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as maternal and fetal morbidity. the etiology of preeclampsia is not fully understood at present. although enormous efforts has been invested in the recent decades in finding reliable biomarkers for early detection and management of preeclampsia, the results are disappointing due to a low detection rate or detection at later gestational ages  <cit> . hence, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and searching for reliable early biomarkers are still the primary tasks for preeclampsia diagnosis and therapy.

delivery of the placenta is the only known cure for preeclampsia, implying that placenta is the principle contributor to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. during early normal placental development, extravillous trophoblasts of fetal origin invade the uterine spiral arteries of the deciduas and myometrium, and remodel the placental vasculature in order to allow sufficient placental perfusion to nourish the fetus. however, inadequate placental trophoblast invasion has been well documented in preeclampsia and it is generally believed to be the main cause for placental underperfusion and the development of preeclampsia  <cit> . the molecular regulatory networks underlying trophoblast invasion have not been well defined. a number of genes that are associated with the invasiveness of carcinoma cells, such as matrix metalloproteinases and fos transcription factors, have been demonstrated to play a role in trophoblast invasion in vitro  <cit> , yet a lot more remain to be explored.

micrornas  are a class of endogenous small non-coding rnas of about  <dig> nucleotides in size, and play pivotal roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of a variety of physiological activities by targeting messenger rnas  for cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . mirnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii in the form of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts  which are cleaved by the drosha ribonuclease iii enzyme to produce approximately 70-nucleotide stem-loop precursor mirnas . pre-mirnas are further cleaved by cytoplasmic dicer ribonuclease to generate mature mirna and antisense mirna products, and the mature mirnas are incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complexes that recognize the target mrnas and interfere with their stability or translation  <cit> . aberrant mirna expression has been reported to be closely associated with multiple diseased conditions in human, including cancer  <cit> , inflammation  <cit>  and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . recently, mirnas expression profiles in human placentas have been characterized, and the dynamically expressed mirnas during pregnancy are thought to influence different aspects of trophoblast biology such as proliferation, syncytialization and invasion , whereas deregulated expression of mirnas in trophoblast cells may lead to placental malfunction or placenta-related diseases such as preeclampsia  <cit> .

mir-34a has been extensively studied in cancer in the aspects of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis  <cit> , yet little is known about the roles of mir-34a in trophoblast biology. recently, doridot and colleagues reported that pri-mirna-34a was overexpressed, yet mature mir-34a was decreased, in the preeclamptic placentas  <cit> . following the paradoxical findings, we first examined the levels of mir-34a in  <dig> preeclamptic placentas in comparison with  <dig> healthy placentas, and found that mature mir-34a was elevated in the preeclamptic placentas. further, we investigated the functions of mir-34a in trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion by overexpressing mir-34a in jeg- <dig> trophoblast cell line. in addition, we identified that myc mrna was a target of mir-34a in jeg- <dig> cells, and revealed that suppressing of myc expression by mir-34a significantly inhibited jeg- <dig> invasion. these results suggest that mir-34a-mediated suppression of myc expression may play a critical role in the regulation of trophoblast invasion and that excessive silencing may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

RESULTS

twenty preeclamptic patients and  <dig> healthy control subjects were recruited in this study, and their clinical characteristics are summarized in table  <dig>  compared to the healthy group, the preeclamptic patients exhibited elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures and proteinuria, whereas the birth weight of the preeclampsia group was significantly lower. after delivery, the chorionic villi were isolated from the placentas, and the levels of mir-34a in the tissues were determined by real-time pcr using u <dig> as the internal control. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the levels of mir-34a in the preeclamptic placentas were significantly higher compared to the healthy placentas, implying that elevated of mir-34a may be involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.table  <dig> clinical characteristics of study subjects

overexpression of mir-34a inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of jeg- <dig> cells
human trophoblast cell line jeg- <dig> was transfected with mir-34a or non-targeting control  expression vectors, and the level of mir-34a was remarkably elevated in the mir-34a-overexpressing cells compared with parental jeg- <dig> cells, whereas nc showed no effects on mir-34a expression . overexpression of mir-34a in jeg- <dig> cells significantly reduced cell proliferation rate as assessed by mtt assay . moreover, in vitro scratch assay revealed that elevated level of mir-34a slowed the migration rate of jeg- <dig> cells , and matrigel-based invasion assay showed that the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells were prominently attenuated upon mir-34a overexpression . taken together, these results indicated that overexpression of mir-34a significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells, suggesting that mir-34a may play critical roles in multiple aspects of trophoblast physiology.fig.  <dig> overexpression of mir-34a inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of jeg- <dig> cells. mir-34a and non-targeting control  sequence were transfected into jeg- <dig> cells. a the level of mature mir-34a was determined by real-time pcr analysis 24 h after transfection. b at 24 h after transfection, the cells were subjected to mtt assay to assess cell proliferation with  <dig> replicates for each time point. c cell migration was measured by scratch wound assay. the cells were photographed at 100× magnification at 0 h and 24 h post-scratching, and the scale bars indicate 100 μm. d at 24 h after transfection, the cells were set up for in vitro matrigel-based invasion assay to assess cell invasiveness. following 24 h incubation, the invading cells on the bottom surface of the transwell membrane were fixed, stained and photographed at 200× magnification , and the average number of invading cells of  <dig> randomly selected fields from each sample were calculated. each experiment was performed at least three times. the figure shows the representative images from repeated experiments and the values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. compared with parental jeg- <dig> cells, *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig> 



mir-34a inhibited invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells by targeting myc
we further investigated the underlying molecular mechanism for the inhibitory role of mir-34a in the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells. myc is a well known oncogene and plays an important role in cancer cell migration and invasion  <cit> . however, whether myc protein also plays a part in the invasion of trophoblast cells is unknown. by enhancing or silencing the expression of myc in jeg- <dig> cells, we found that the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells was associated with the expression level of myc , indicating that myc also plays an important role in regulating the invasion of jeg- <dig> cells. we then tested our hypothesis that mir-34a regulates the invasion of jeg- <dig> cell via targeting myc mrna. western blot analysis showed that overexpression of mir-34a in jeg- <dig> cells downregulated the expression of endogenous myc protein . jeg- <dig> cells were further co-transfected with myc and mir-34a expression vectors, using the corresponding empty vectors pcdna <dig>  and p-egfp as the controls. as shown in fig. 4b, the level of myc protein was markedly elevated in the cells transfected with myc expression vector, and the level was significantly reduced by co-expression of mir-34a, suggesting that mir-34a regulates the expression myc in jeg- <dig> cells. furthermore, direct binding of mir-34a on the 3’-untranslated region  of myc mrna was assessed by dual luciferase reporter assay. myc 3’-utr sequence containing the putative mir-34a binding site was pcr-amplified and cloned into a firefly luciferase reporter vector pmirglo. in jeg- <dig> cells, the firefly vectors with and without insertion of myc 3’-urt were co-transfected with mir-34a expression vector, mutant mir-34a  expression vector or p-egfp empty vector. at 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was significantly reduced in the myc reporter cells overexpressing mir-34a, whereas mutation in mir-34a abolished the translational inhibition . hence, the luciferase assay demonstrated that mir-34a bound directly and specifically to myc 3’-urt and repressed the translation of myc in jeg- <dig> cells. we further assessed the effect of mir-34a-mediated downregulation of myc on the invasiveness of trophoblast cells. matrigel-based invasion assay showed that overexpression of myc protein enhanced the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells, and such myc-enhanced invasion was significantly suppressed by co-expression of mir-34a . in summary, the above results suggest that myc promotes trophoblast invasion, while mir-34a inhibits trophoblast invasion by downregulating myc expression via direct targeting on myc transcripts.fig.  <dig> myc regulates the invasion of jeg- <dig> cells. jeg- <dig> cells were transfected with myc overexpression construct, myc sirna, or the corresponding empty vectors. 48 h later, the levels of a
myc mrna and b myc protein in the cells were analyzed by real-time pcr and western blot analysis respectively, using β-actin as the internal control. c matrigel-based transwell invasion assay was set up 24 h after transfection, and the number of invading cells was counted 24 h later at 200× magnification . this figure shows the representative images from three independent experiments, and the values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. *p <  <dig> ; **p <  <dig> ; ***p <  <dig>

discussion
trophoblast cells are a heterogeneous group of cells forming the fetal-maternal interface and exhibiting a wide spectrum of functions. first trimester and term trophoblast cells display different mirna fingerprints, implying that dynamic expression of mirnas may play critical roles in the regulation of differential behaviors of trophoblast cells at various stages during placentation  <cit> , whereas deregulated mirnas during this physiological process can lead to placental malfunction and related diseases such as preeclampsia  <cit> . doridot et al. reported that pri-mir-34a was overexpressed in the preeclamptic placentas but the mature mir-34a level was decreased  <cit> . in this study, we first examined the level of mature mir-34a in preeclamptic placentas, and found that the mature mir-34a was indeed elevated in the preeclamptic placentas, which is consistent with the pattern of pri-mir-34a in doridot’s work. doridot et al. extended the mirnas by the non-specific poly-adenylation method before real-time pcr analysis, and here, we used a stemloop primer-based method, which has been demonstrated to be more efficient and specific  <cit> . hence, we believe that the contradictory results of pir-mir-34a and mature mir-34a in doridot’s work may be attributed to the technical flaw in mirna extension.

the role of mir-34a in placental development and in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia is unclear. in the present study, using jeg- <dig> trophoblast cell line as the model, we demonstrated that overexpression of mir-34a inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that mir-34a plays important roles in many aspects of trophoblast biology. further investigation on the molecular target of mir-34a revealed that mir-34a directly bound to the 3’-utr of myc transcripts and suppressed myc expression. moreover, the invasiveness of jeg- <dig> cells were largely dependent on the level of myc protein, which was regulated by mir-34a, suggesting that targeting myc by mir-34a may play a critical role in the regulation of trophoblast invasion, and that excessive suppression of myc translation by mir-34a may result in inadequate trophoblast invasion and the development of preeclampsia.

inadequate trophoblast invasion is so far recognized as a major pathological factor for preeclampsia  <cit> . extensive work has been conducted to address the molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired trophoblast invasion, and a number of cancer-related molecules have been identified to play a role in trophoblast invasion  <cit> . because of the inherently invasive nature, trophoblast cells are often compared with highly invasive carcinoma cells, and in many cases, both exhibit similar gene expression signatures that regulate cell invasion. our study demonstrated that the levels of mir-34a and myc, which have been shown to regulate tumor cell invasion and metastasis  <cit> , significantly affected the invasive capacity of jeg- <dig> cells. these observations are consistent with their functions in cancer. although the functions of mir-34a or myc in placental development have been rarely reported, numerous studies on mir-34a and myc have been done in cancer. mir-34a was reported to directly target myc mrna in lymphoma and interfere with p53-dependent apoptotic pathway  <cit> . in addition, mir-34a can indirectly regulate myc expression through wnt signaling pathway in glioma  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that mir-34a could directly targeted myc mrna and modulate its expression in trophoblast cells, thereby regulating the invasiveness of the cells. interestingly, previous studies have shown that the transcription of mir34a is repressed by myc protein via binding in the vicinity of the mir34a gene promoter  <cit> , suggesting that a regulatory feedback loop may exist between mir-34a and myc, and disruption of the balance between these two molecules can result in cell dysfunction, and in this case, impaired trophoblast invasion.

although jeg- <dig> is widely used in the studies on trophoblast biology, researchers should bear in mind that jeg- <dig> is derived from choriocarcinoma, thus it inherits typical properties of tumor cells, such as accelerated proliferation and enhanced invasiveness. hence, the functions of mir-34a in trophoblasts should be verified in primary trophoblast cells. in our preliminary experiments, we indeed observed that overexpression of mir-34a suppressed proliferation and invasiveness of placental cells from crude collegenase digestion of chorionic villi . in future studies, the role of mir-34a in trophoblast proliferation should be assessed in primary villous trophoblasts, while its role in trophoblast invasion should be done using primary extra villous trophoblasts, wherein high purity of the isolated cells is the key.

preeclampsia may cause maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, and requires close medical monitoring. in the recent decades, numerous effects have been invested to find an efficient approach for the early detection of preeclampsia. serum levels of the soluble proteins that are involved in placental angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- <dig>  placental growth factor and endoglin, have been proposed as potential markers, but the results are unsatisfactory  <cit> . recently, studies have shown that fetal cell-free nucleic acids can enter maternal circulation and may reflect the pathological conditions in placental diseases like preeclampsia  <cit> . hence, it is intriguing and clinically significant to know whether the level of mir-34a in the maternal plasma circulation could serve as a potential biomarker for preeclampsia, which is to be addressed in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we reported elevated levels of mir-34a in the preeclamptic placentas and demonstrated that mir-34a can suppress proliferation, migration and invasion of jeg- <dig> trophoblast cells. moreover, mir-34a may regulate trophoblast invasion by targeting myc. our findings suggest that mir-34a plays a critical role in trophoblast biology and it may be also involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.
