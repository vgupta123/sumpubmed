BACKGROUND
mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia
 <cit> , causing substantial economic losses to the pig industry through reduced average daily weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization, prophylactic and therapeutic costs, and mortality
 <cit> . when co-infections occur with a secondary  infection, the respiratory disease is more severe and has been designated as porcine respiratory disease complex
 <cit> , an even more devastating disease. the virulence factors of m. hyopneumoniae are largely unknown and to better understand the mechanisms involved, we are studying genetic processes in m. hyopneumoniae both in vitro and in vivo
. recent microarray studies of global transcriptional changes clearly show that under the culture conditions used in this study,  <dig> of the  <dig> known protein coding genes are transcribed
. m. hyopneumoniae also responds to environmental changes, and under various stressors, all annotated genes are transcribed
. further, a recent study from our laboratory also shows that intergenic regions are transcribed
 <cit> . the genome for m. hyopneumoniae has been sequenced
, and from that sequence,  <dig> protein coding genes have been annotated in strain  <dig>  our next steps in completing the picture of gene expression in m. hyopneumoniae has been to construct a proteogenomic map of m. hyopneumoniae and to survey its metabolic capabilities. this will assist in annotating the genome and identifying any potential genes missed in the original annotation that could explain the extent of intergenic transcription observed by gardner et al.
 <cit> . to this end we have employed both one and two dimensional liquid chromatography nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry .

RESULTS
identified proteins
protein samples were analyzed using two mass spectrometers, an ltq velos pro  and an ltq ft ultra . samples were run on the ft as part of a post translational modification study beyond the scope of this manuscript but are included here for protein identification purposes only. x!tandem
 <cit>  and omssa
 <cit>  peptide identifications from the velos and ft were combined, resulting in  <dig>  peptide sequences identified from  <dig>  peptide-spectrum matches with a maximum false discovery rate of  <dig> %. subsequently,  <dig> proteins  of the currently annotated  <dig> protein coding genes in m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> were identified;  <dig> of  <dig>  hypothetical proteins have been confirmed. supporting information additional file

differential detergent fractionation
differential detergent fractionation  was used to sequentially extract proteins based on hydrophobicity. a gene ontology  enrichment was performed on proteins identified from the different ddf fractions, as well as those from the non-ddf, ft runs. table 
 <dig> shows the number of proteins matching several important go cellular component categories for 1) all annotated proteins, 2) each ddf fraction, 3) all fractions and 4) the non-ddf runs. ddf and non-ddf methods resulted in no difference in number of intracellular, chromosomal and ribosomal protein identifications. however, ddf provided a 29% increase in the number of membrane proteins and 12% increase in cytoplasmic proteins. furthermore, the sodium dodecyl sulphate  and insoluble fractions contained 80% more membrane proteins than digitonin and tween  <dig>  a similar but less pronounced trend was also seen in cytoplasmic proteins.table  <dig>

proteogenomic mapping
to complement the identification of known and predicted proteins in m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig>  and subsequently identify possible unannotated open reading frames  and errors in the current annotations, mass spectra were searched using x!tandem and omssa against a 6-frame genomic translation. the genomic searches resulted in  <dig>  peptide sequences from  <dig>  matched spectra with a maximum false discovery rate of  <dig> %. after combining both the protein and genome search results,  <dig>  unique peptide sequences were identified from  <dig>  positively matched spectra across all eight samples. detailed peptide identifications with confidence scores are provided in supplemental information additional file
3: genome search results.

peptide sequences were mapped to the m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> genome and categorized by location . proteogenomic mapping revealed two areas of intergenic translation, annotated in other stains of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae as genes gatc and rpmf. five-prime extensions to annotated genes were identified in mhp <dig>  mhp <dig>  and mhp451; blast results indicate these extensions are present in genes in other strains. the prodigal prokaryotic gene predicting software also predicted the previously unannotated genes and extensions in agreement with proteogenomic mapping .table  <dig>

discussion
identified proteins
one other group has performed a recent global proteomics analysis of m. hyopneumoniae similar to our study; pinto et al. reported identifying 35% of the proteins in strains j,  <dig> and 7448
 <cit> . jaffe et al. identified 81% of the proteins of the related species m. pneumoniae
 <cit>  and yuan et al. identified 51% of the proteins in m. suis
 <cit> . by combining all of our samples, we identified 70% of the proteins in m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig>  the increase in proteome coverage from 35% to 70% achieved by our study is likely due to the large number of replicates  compared to a maximum of three stated in the other studies, and the dual instrument, dual sample preparation approach used in our analysis.

many of the proteins identified in this study are only computationally predicted and, as such, given the "hypothetical" annotation. our high throughput experimental annotation confirms that  <dig>  of these genes are translated. from our previous transcriptome studies
, evidence shows that  <dig> of the  <dig> protein coding genes are transcribed under the growing conditions in this study. we failed to identify  <dig> of the  <dig> total protein coding genes because they: 1) are expressed at very low levels or not at all under the culture conditions; 2) were not included as they did not make our stringent identification criteria; 3) were mis-annotated or contained sequencing errors; 4) contain peptides which are inherently resistant to electrospray ionization; or 5) in the case of the hypothetical product of mhp <dig>  produce no tryptic peptides of suitable size  identifiable using the analysis techniques employed in this study.

differential detergent fractionation
m. hyopneumoniae cells were subjected to ddf and non-ddf sample preparation techniques in this study. membrane proteins are frequently insoluble in most detergent solutions used in sample preparation
 <cit> , and it is reasonable to expect an abundance of membrane proteins in the sds fractions and insoluble cellular debris. ddf was performed using  <dig> detergents of increasing strength: digitonin, tween  <dig> and sds. table 
 <dig> shows the number of annotated proteins in several major go categories, as well as numbers identified in ddf and non-ddf methods. there are  <dig> annotated membrane related proteins in m .hyopyneumoniae strain  <dig>  thirty four of these proteins , were identified in the non-ddf analysis, verses  <dig>  from ddf, amounting to a 30% increase. furthermore, evidence shows 80% more membrane proteins being identified in the sds and insoluble fractions. a similar but less pronounced trend was seen with cytoplasmic proteins, with ddf providing a 12% increase in protein identifications over non-ddf. a 25% increase in cytoplasmic proteins was seen in the sds and insoluble fractions over digitonin and tween  <dig>  protein concentration in the digitonin fractions was about 10-fold greater than that the other fractions, indicating that less abundant, hydrophobic membrane and cytoplasmic proteins could be masked from detection in a non-ddf method. all fractions were normalized to 20 μg before digestion, therefore enriching the analysis with membrane proteins by over representing tween  <dig>  sds and insoluble proteins. it is interesting that more cytoplasmic proteins were identified in the more hydrophobic fractions. since cytoplasm is composed of cytosol, ogranelles and various other inclusions, it is reasonable to expect proteins from the more organized structures to be less soluble that those in the cytosol. this easily explains the increase in numbers with hydrophobicity. no other go categories showed such an increase in protein identifications with ddf. this evidence shows that samples can be enriched with membrane proteins by using a series of detergents to solublize proteins based on increasing hydrophobicity, and subsequently normalizing on protein quantity. much future work is required to provide a more detailed go analysis of m. hyopeumoniae proteins, as only  <dig>  of known proteins have cellular component annotation, most of which are very generalized. better annotation would be helpful in categorizing which cellular components are easily separated based on ddf methods.

proteogenomic mapping
proteogenomic mapping indicates that the current m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> genome is well annotated with only  <dig> % of peptide mappings not belonging to currently known genes. the identification of two unannotated genes, gatc and rpmf, is surprising considering the small genome size and high degree of genetic similarity between m. hyopneumoniae strains. the 5-prime extensions, present in annotated genes from other strains, were not predicted in strain  <dig> likely due to bias in the orf finding algorithm used. orf finders typically scan the  <dig> frames of a genomic sequence and predict orfs based on distance between start and stop codons. prodigal has an advantage over this type of orf finder in that it scans for ribosomal binding sites . as shown in table 
 <dig>  each gene predicted by prodigal, has a different rbs motif. all of these motifs are present in other proteins correctly predicted in the original annotations. if the original prediction did not rely on rbs detection, failure to determine the true start codons for certain orfs would be more likely, explaining the 5' extensions detected by proteogenomic mapping. as for the unannotated genes, rpmf and gatc, it is unclear as to why these were missed. they are rather short genes, rpmf and gatc being  <dig> and  <dig> bases in length respectively, but  <dig> annotated genes are shorter than both. gatc overlaps the 5' end of gata, but  <dig> other annotated genes overlap another. these difficult to explain instances are good reasons to validate predictions with proteomic and transcriptomic data.

our previous study aimed at detecting intergenic transcription in m. hyopneumoniae found evidence for  <dig> instances of intergenic transcription
 <cit> . we have evidence of transcription in intergenic regions upstream from mhp <dig> and mhp <dig>  which supports the 5-prime extensions of these genes detected in this study. no transcription evidence was found for the 5-prime extension of mhp <dig>  both unannotated genes identified in this study, gatc and rpmf, also have corresponding areas of intergenic transcription. in future studies, next generation transcriptome sequencing would be a good choice to complement proteogenomic mapping and help confirm the existence of unannotated and modified genes. unlike proteomics, transcriptomics allows gene boundaries to be clearly determined and errors in the genomic sequence to be considered when mapping reads.

trypsin has been the enzyme of choice in proteomic analyses for many years because of is high specificity, but protein primary structures rich in lysine  and arginine  residues can result in peptides too small  to uniquely identify most proteins. conversely, areas poor in k and r produce peptides too large  to be accurately identified by low resolution mass spectrometers, such as the ltq velos pro used in this study. secondary and tertiary protein structures resistant to denaturation can contain areas inaccessible to trypsin. alternate protein fragmentation methods can increase protein coverage, which is beneficial in proteogenomic mapping studies which rely on maximizing coverage. using multiple proteases which target different residues, such as trypsin, elastase and thermolysin, can result in overlapping peptides averaging  <dig> amino acids in length
 <cit> . proteinase k digestion carried out at high ph produces peptides of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, ideal for ms/ms analysis
 <cit> . a multiple protease approach increases the likelihood accessing structurally inaccessible cleavage sites and reduces the impact of protein regions rich or poor in residues targeted by a single enzyme. a followup study employing this approach would be beneficial by potentially increasing protein coverage and further confirming unannotated areas of protein expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has provided one of the deepest proteome analyses of m. hyopneumoniae to date. seventy percent of strain  <dig> proteins were identified and 52% of hypothetical proteins have been confirmed. previously unannotated genes gatc and rpmf have been identified for the first time strain  <dig>  five-prime extensions of genes mhp <dig>  mhp <dig> and mhp <dig> were also detected. these additions and modifications to the current annotations are conserved in other strains of m. hyopneumoniae and all but one, mhp <dig>  have evidence of transcription as determined by our previous studies
. these findings illustrate how even the smallest annotated genomes are far from perfect, and future work, both transcriptomic and proteomic, is required to better understand the m. hyopneumoniae genome. additionally, using a gene prediction program which detects ribosomal binding sites ensures genes are less likely to be incorrectly defined or missed during analysis. furthermore, the use of ddf effectively enriches samples with membrane proteins by allowing proteins to be separated based on increasing hydrophobicity. highly soluble, highly abundant proteins are concentrated in a relatively weak detergent while less soluble, less abundant membrane proteins are extracted in progressively stronger detergents. normalizing fractions by quantity prior to trypsin digestion allows low abundance, hydrophobic proteins a greater chance of being identified. the current go annotations for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae are lacking depth and completion; much work is required to annotate the proteome both physically and functionally. better go annotation would provide a more thorough breakdown of protein and cellular component affinity to ddf fraction.
