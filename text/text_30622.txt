BACKGROUND
the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a leading system in genomics due to the small genome size  and the availability of powerful genetic techniques. genome sequencing of multiple hemiascomycete yeasts and multiple individuals from several species have allowed the application of a range of powerful comparative approaches. comparative genomics have revealed evolutionary mechanisms that shape genomes and provided a formidable tool for assigning function to dna sequence
 <cit> .

the closely related sensu stricto saccharomyces species  provide a clade with multiple genetically tractable species
 <cit> . the genome sequence of several sensu stricto species
 <cit>  revealed a level of nucleotide divergence comparable to that between humans and birds yet a level of structural variation comparable to that between humans and chimps
 <cit> . comparisons of genome structures have provided insight into mechanisms of genome evolution and speciation. for example, the presence of a limited number of genomic rearrangements that are not consistent with the phylogeny, provide strong evidence against the chromosomal speciation model
 <cit> .

sequence comparisons between the sensu stricto species have allowed improved genome annotation
 <cit> . sequence conservation allowed the identification of additional small open reading frames and the refinement of translation start and stop positions. lack of sequence conservation resulted in the elimination of spurious open reading frames. combining experimental data for protein binding sites with sequence conservation allowed the identification of functional dna sequences
 <cit> . the power of these and other comparative genomic approaches
 <cit>  rely upon the number of species sequenced, the evolutionary divergence of the selected species and the quality of the assembled genome sequence.

recently the yeast saccharomyces arboricolus was isolated from the bark of the fagaceae tree in china
 <cit> . the s. arboricolus karyotype is consistent with the other sensu stricto species in terms of chromosome number and size. sequence information  unambiguously grouped this species within the sensu stricto complex. s. arboricolus can form viable hybrids with the other sensu stricto species but resulting gametes are not viable
 <cit> . together these data demonstrate that s. arboricolus is a novel sensu stricto species.

here, we report high-quality sequence and assembly of the s. arboricolus genome  by combining two deep sequencing platforms. we report chromosome size scaffolds, genome annotation and synteny analysis. genome wide phylogenetic analysis places s. arboricolus between s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii in the sensu stricto phylogenetic tree. finally, we considered the phenotypic profile of s. arboricolus under multiple environmental conditions in the light of its gene content and phylogeny.

RESULTS
genome sequence and assembly
we generated a high quality genome assembly for s. arboricolus using a combination of high-throughput sequencing platforms and strategies . first, we generated single-end reads using the roche  <dig> pyrosequencing platform. this gave long reads that facilitated assembly. second, we used roche  <dig> paired-end reads, with ~8 kb insert size, to join contigs into chromosome size scaffolds . we anticipated that the large insert size of the paired-end library would be sufficient to span any repeat elements . finally, we used 50 bp reads from solid  sequencing  to correct homopolymer errors present in the roche  <dig> sequence. this combination strategy resulted in high quality sequence with chromosome-sized scaffolds.

de novo assembly of the roche  <dig>  reads was performed using the newbler algorithm . this resulted in  <dig> contigs  that were joined using the roche  <dig> paired-end reads to give  <dig> scaffolds. there are  <dig> scaffolds that are comprised of a single contig  and one scaffold comprising of two contigs . the remaining  <dig> scaffolds account for >99% of the assembly and are between  <dig> and 1246 kb long. the total base count of the assembly,  <dig>  mb, is comparable to the physical genome size predicted from the karyotype
 <cit>  and is similar to the completed s. cerevisiae genome sequence  and genome sequence of other sensu stricto yeasts 
 <cit> .

pyrosequencing suffers from an inherent difficulty in determining the number of incorporated nucleotides in homopolymer regions, due to the non-linear signal from the incorporation of > <dig> identical nucleotides
 <cit> . comparing our s. arboricolus genome sequence to s. cerevisiae, identified > <dig> open reading frames  with putative frame-shifts . these putative frame-shifts are predominantly in homopolymer runs and are therefore likely due to errors in the pyrosequencing . indeed the s. paradoxus assembly
 <cit> , which was based on sanger sequence reads , shows less than half the number of frame-shifts than s. arboricolus . we further analyzed the homopolymeric runs that cause frame-shifts and found that they tended to be longer and more a-biased than the corresponding frame-shifts in s. paradoxus . to overcome this problem we used solid sequencing that relies on a different chemistry and is not subject to the same error. we used the roche  <dig> de novo assembly to map the solid reads, identify errors and then correct the assembly. this mapping, errors calling and correction process was then repeated a further  <dig> times. in total we corrected  <dig> single base substitutions and  <dig> indels. this resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of putative frame-shifts to levels comparable to that seen with conventional sanger sequencing . the corrected assembly also improved the distribution of frame-shifts such that the over-abundance of long homopolymeric runs and the a-bias were greatly reduced .

the coverage of mapped solid reads gives a measure of sequence copy number and can be used to reveal repeat regions that have collapsed during assembly. overall we find a scarcity of high-coverage regions , implying that there has been very little collapse of repeat regions during assembly. short  regions of elevated copy number frequently correspond to highly repetitive tandem repeats and/or homopolymer tracks. longer regions of elevated copy number are predominantly subtelomeric with the noteworthy exception of the rdna repeats on chromosome xii.

the resulting s. arboricolus genome assembly comprises of whole chromosome scaffolds with only  <dig> gaps. these gaps have an average size of 1206 bp, the smallest two are just 1 bp, and the largest is 5846 bp. these regions consist of complex or repetitive sequences resulting in poor mapping of the solid data. by comparison to recently improved assemblies of other sensu stricto yeasts
 <cit> , our s. arboricolus genome sequence has a higher proportion of the sequence  in a smaller number of scaffolds . therefore, after the ‘gold standard’ s. cerevisiae, our s. arboricolus genome sequence represents the next most complete assembly.

genome structure and annotation
we compared our s. arboricolus genome assembly to the s. cerevisiae reference genome using lastz. we found that the  <dig> long scaffolds are each syntenic with a single s. cerevisiae chromosome or the mitochondrial genome with the exception of one predicted reciprocal translocation  between the right arms of chromosome iv and xiii. the breakpoints are intergenic regions between orfs mrpl <dig> and tma <dig> on chromosome iv and yku <dig> and spg <dig> on chromosome xiii . interestingly, the breakpoint on chromosome xiii is adjacent to a trna gene, a feature previously reported to be associated with reciprocal translocations
 <cit> . we used diagnostic pcr to experimentally confirm this reciprocal translocation . the reciprocal translocation is unique to s. arboricolus, it is not present in s. bayanus or other sensu stricto assemblies
 <cit>  and therefore occurred after the s. arboricolus radiation.
 <cit> ) and the primer locations  used to confirm the translocation.  pcr-based confirmation of the reciprocal translocation. various primer and template combinations  were used to amplify products corresponding to either the s. cerevisiae or the s. arboricolus gene order. in each case the resulting pcr products support the reciprocal translocation identified by the genome assembly.

the gene content of sensu stricto budding yeast species is thought to be similar
 <cit> , therefore we used comparative gene-annotation methods based on the well-annotated s. cerevisiae proteome to identify and annotate the orfs in the s. arboricolus genome. using exonerate
 <cit> , we aligned each s. cerevisiae protein to the s. arboricolus genome . we assigned the top matching s. arboricolus orf  as a putative ortholog to each s. cerevisiae protein. we then compared the neighbouring genes of each s. cerevisiae gene with the neighbours of the putative orthologous s. arboricolus orf to define a first set of  <dig> orthologous gene pairs where the gene order has been conserved, which we refer to as “syntenic orthologs”. because this method uses the best sequence match, missing assignments of syntenic orthologous orfs may occur when the match with greatest sequence similarity is not the syntenic ortholog. to overcome this problem, we again used exonerate but emphasized the position of the predicted orf, allowing the score to be slightly below the best scoring match . an additional 519 s. cerevisiae genes had a high-scoring, but not top match with the expected syntenic gene pair. we considered these to be syntenic orthologs as sequence similarity together with gene order conservation is thought to be a more reliable indicator of orthology than sequence similarity alone
 <cit> . to identify genes that may be found in s. arboricolus, but not in s. cerevisiae, we used genemark
 <cit> , which is a de novo gene prediction method, and does not rely on sequence similarity  and identified  <dig> genes that were not predicted using exonerate. these genemark predictions contain novel genes and orfs that were missed by exonerate as only the best hit from exonerate was considered in our gene prediction.

we explored the possibility that our annotation of the s. arboricolus genome contained novel genes. as was observed with the s. bayanus genome
 <cit> , the vast majority  of the genes in s. arboricolus have conserved gene order with s. cerevisiae. the remaining “non-syntenic” genes include  <dig> that have similarity to another s. cerevisiae gene but are not syntenic  and the  <dig> the genes predicted de novo . analysis of the non-syntenic genes allowed the detection of at least two small local rearrangements relative to s. cerevisiae due to inversion of a large portion of dna. the first one occurs on chromosome vi between orfs far <dig> and yfr017c  and the second one on chromosome xiv between ynl034w and cog <dig> . to determine whether these were specific to the s. arboricolus genome, we compared these regions to the other sensu stricto genomes, and found that the s. cerevisiae gene order is likely to be the derived state, as s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii shows the same gene order as s. arboricolus . other synteny breaks occur predominantly in the subtelomeric regions: there is a significant enrichment of non-syntenic and novel genes predicted in the first and last 10% of the chromosomes 
 <cit> . we also considered the genes predicted in s. arboricolus that were not syntenic with s. cerevisiae. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> had no blast hits within the s. cerevisiae genome . interestingly,  <dig> of these  <dig> genes are likely to be s. cerevisiae specific gene losses, rather than new genes arising in s. arboricolus, as they are found in s. bayanus . two of the non-telomeric s. cerevisiae gene losses are sir <dig> genes as previously reported
 <cit> . of the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> have no blast hit within uniref <dig>  and we considered the possibility that these were truly novel genes. after manual inspection based on presence of stop codons within the predicted peptide, protein sequence lengths, pfam analysis andadditional blast searches, we concluded that  <dig> of these genes are likely to represent novel genes in s. arboricolus .
 <cit> .

we also searched for trna coding sequences within the  <dig> chromosomes using trnascan-se
 <cit>  and annotated whether they were syntenic using a similar strategy to that described above . in total,  <dig> trnas were found,  <dig> of which are syntenic with s. cerevisiae trnas. next we used blast to search for the presence of repetitive elements in the genome such as subtelomeric genes and ty elements. we detected the most distal subtelomeric element, y’, in the genome sequence. this element is therefore present in all the sensu stricto species except s. bayanus <cit> . we also detected ty <dig> element sequences using as a query the region that does not share similarity with the ty <dig> element .

phylogenetic analysis
we tested five possible placements of s. arboricolus within the sensu stricto complex , by sampling  <dig> sets of  <dig> random proteins for which we have data for all  <dig> sensu stricto species, as well as s. castellii as outgroup. these protein sequences were concatenated, and we computed the likelihood of the five phylogenetic trees using paml. all  <dig> trees supported the grouping of s. arboricolus as diverging after the common ancestor with s. bayanus and before s. kudriavzevii, and all but  <dig> of these trees obtained bootstrap scores > <dig> . originally s. arboricolus was placed, based on a limited amount of ribosomal dna sequence, between s. mikatae and s. kudriavzevii <cit> , however our genome-scale phylogenetic analysis has much greater power and unambiguously supports the new tree structure .

we next set out to estimate the evolutionary distances between the species in the sensu stricto clade. to do so, we used the phylogeny as determined above, and computed codon-based maximum likelihood estimates  of evolutionary distance based on alignments of  <dig> genes for which we had  <dig> to  <dig> orthologs in all of the sensu stricto species, and that were syntenic between s. arbicolus and s. cerevisiae. we computed the median branch lengths  for these, and they are shown in figure
 <dig> 

s. arboricolus web and strain resources
to make the s. arboricolus genome sequence available and to facilitate analysis, we have made available a number of web resources . these include genome sequence, annotation and datasets for genes and proteins. the gene and protein sets are annotated based on the s. cerevisiae ortholog systematic name. novel putative orfs identified by genemark are also reported. a blast server and a genome browser  are available. the s. arboricolus genome browser offers the opportunity to view and compare the genome structure of s. cerevisiae, s. arboricolus and s. bayanus. using s. arboricolus as the central reference species, gene order conservation or chromosomal rearrangements between the three species can easily be observed. genes in s. arboricolus are coloured differently based on their annotation . finally, to facilitate experimental analysis of s. arboricolus the ho gene was disrupted  and stable haploids were generated.

s. arboricolus phenotypic landscape
taking the phylogeny and gene content of s. arboricolus  into account, we revisited recently generated data on its phenotypic diversity. although included for completeness in our publication on the phenotypic landscape of saccharomyces sensu stricto species
 <cit> , the s. arboricolus phenotypes were not specifically analyzed or commented on. the sequenced strain  and two additional, genetically distinct lineages isolated from similar habitats in southern china were subjected to high resolution phenotyping of proliferative capability across > <dig> environments selected to represent variations in common yeast habitats, such as carbon and nitrogen source variations, tolerance to metabolites and toxins produced by plants and bacteria, and variations in vitamins and mineral availability . the fitness components lag, rate  and efficiency of reproduction  were extracted from high density growth curves and normalized to those of the s. cerevisiae reference strain, providing > <dig> precise measures of organism-environment interactions . in the absence of stress, s. arboricolus proliferated slightly slower than s. cerevisiae and one strain  also showed reduced efficiency . however, these s. arboricolus growth aberrations in conditions with no stress were marginal compared to the dramatic proliferation deviations observed in a vast range of stress-inducing niche environments . remarkably, almost all of these aberrations constituted grave defects, many corresponding to more than 10-fold reductions in mitotic performance. thus, s. arboricolus showed drastically reduced tolerance to fruit organic acids such as citric, tartaric and oxalic acid and to high temperatures and very poor utilization of adenine, serine and threonine as nitrogen sources. notably, s. arboricolus failed to proliferate during conditions of elevated li+ and cu2+, traits likely explained by absence of the amplifications of the lithium exporter  and the copper metallothionein  that determine these traits in s. cerevisiae <cit>  . the many niche specific proliferation deficiencies of s. arboricolus may explain its limited geographical and ecological distribution compared to s. cerevisiae.
 <cit> . red = lag, green = rate, blue = efficiency. grey diagonals indicate 1: <dig> correlations, numbers indicate pearson correlation coefficients.  phenotypes distinguishing s. arboricolus from s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii respectively. significant phenotype differences were defined at α< <dig>  . error bars = standard error of the mean.

among the rare examples of superior s. arboricolus performance were better utilization of the sugar alcohol mannitol, one of the most abundant energy storage molecules in nature
 <cit>  and tolerance to biotin depletion, rarely observed in s. cerevisiae due to ancestral loss of the biotin synthesis genes bio <dig> and bio <dig> <cit> . both bio <dig> and bio <dig> are present as conserved cistrons in s. arboricolus strain cbs 10644tt , explaining the biotin auxotrophy. s. arboricolus also featured consistently good utilization of the monosaccharide galactose , a highly variable trait in both s. cerevisiae <cit>  and s. kudriavzevii <cit>  due to frequent loss-of-function mutations emerging in different lineages of these species that impair growth on galactose . the coding sequences of the gal pathway genes are also fully conserved in s. arboricolus strain cbs 10644tt. interestingly, s. arboricolus strain cbs 10644tt has also retained an intact melibiase encoding mel <dig>  which is lost in most s. cerevisiae lineages
 <cit> ; all three s. arboricolus isolates also utilized the disaccharide melibiose, a less common plant energy storage compound, with a vastly superior rate and efficiency.

overall, the three s. arboricolus isolates showed virtually identical trait profiles . moreover, using data from warringer et al.
 <cit> , we found s. arboricolus traits to closely mimic those of its relatives, s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii . these remarkable trait similarities, encompassing mitotic performance in a wide variety of environments, imply that these three species, despite billions of generations of separation, are adapted to rather similar ecological conditions. the few cases of s. arboricolus deviations from s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii primarily included nitrogen utilization traits, such as superior s. arboricolus utilization of ammonium, glycine and ornithine, but inferior utilization of methionine, serine and citrulline . presumably, this reflects differences in nitrogen storage compounds among plant species that dominate the main habitats of these species and hint at ecological factors that may have driven speciation of the ancestral lineages. further indications as to the nature of these factors may also be found in the reduced tolerance of s. arboricolus to malic acid, concentrated in e.g. apples, and to the toxin geneticin, produced by bacteria of the micromonospora genus .

discussion
our approach of using multiple high-throughput sequencing strategies resulted in high quality genome sequence that continuously covers the large majority of the s. arboricolus genome. the de novo assembly revealed that s. arboricolus is largely syntenic to s. cerevisiae, similar to the other sensu stricto species. we mapped and validated a single reciprocal translocation that occurred in the s. arboricolus lineage and identified a few additional small-scale rearrangements. our assembly extends into the subtelomeric regions of most chromosome ends. however, these repetitive sequences pose a major challenge to genome assemblies and the subtelomeric structure presented here will benefit from further experimental validation.

sequence analysis unambiguously revealed the position of s. arboricolus in the phylogenetic tree . phylogeny of individual genes revealed a limited number of conflicting tree topology as has been previously reported for other sensu stricto species
 <cit> . we did not observe large segments of the genome  with high similarity with other species as signature of introgression as previously reported in other species and strains
 <cit> .

we have looked for the presence and absence of middle repetitive elements such as ty and subtelomeric genes. for some of these elements the presence and absence is consistent with the phylogeny
 <cit> . we detected the subtelomeric element y’ in s. arboricolus, indicating that this element entered in the sensu stricto ancestor after the divergence of s. bayanus. much more puzzling is the phylogeny of ty <dig>  present in s. cerevisiae, s. mikatae and s. arboricolus but absent in s. paradoxus, s. kudriavzevii and s. bayanus. both multiple loss and acquisition can explain the scattered phylogeny but are unlikely events. one possibility is a recent exchange of ty <dig> among these species  as supported by high sequence similarity. a possible mechanism is the ability of these species to fuse their cytoplasms, without progressing to karyogamy, and allowing the exchange of ty particles that can self-propagate in the genome.

phenotype analysis demonstrated a remarkable similarity in trait profiles between s. arboricolus and both s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii . these similarities suggest that these three species have adapted to similar environmental niches. the limited number of phenotypic differences between these species may reflect the specific nutrients available within each species habitat. phenotypic comparisons between s. cerevisiae and s. arboricolus frequently reflect differences in gene content, including the sensitivity of s. arboricolus to elevated li+ and cu2+ and the ability of s. arboricolus to utilize melibiose.

so far, the chinese isolates of s. arboricolus are the only ones available. future surveys will reveal whether this species is limited to this region or whether other geographic populations exist. it is interesting to note that two of the saccharomyces species have only been isolated in asia  despite extensive surveys in similar environments in other continents
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the saccharomyces sensu stricto complex offers a powerful range of sequence divergences that have allowed the mapping of functional elements
 <cit> , improved genome annotation and comparisons of genome organization
 <cit> . genome sequencing has revealed levels of divergence ranging from  <dig>  -  <dig> % among s. cerevisiae strains,  <dig>  -  <dig> % between geographic subpopulations of s. paradoxus <cit> , 6% between s. bayanus var. uvarum and s. eubayanus <cit> , and 15% - 30% between s. cerevisiae and the other sensu stricto species
 <cit> . the s. arboricolus genome sequence should enhance the power of comparative genomics by increasing the total sequence divergence and improve the quality of alignments by adding a new branch between s. bayanus and s. kudriavzevii, the more divergent species.
