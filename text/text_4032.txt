BACKGROUND
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae  is a gram-negative bacterium, which is a major cause of otitis media  <cit> . the organism also causes pneumonia and other respiratory tract diseases in humans  <cit> . type iv pili  mediate adherence, twitching motility, and play a role in transformation . we previously demonstrated that nthi produce tfp under defined environmental conditions. these tfp are responsible for twitching motility, tfp-mediated adherence and contribute to biofilm development  <cit> . the products of the pilabcd gene cluster play a role in tfp biogenesis  <cit> . the pila gene is predicted to encode the major pilin subunit. the pilb protein is homologous to hexameric secretion atpases and the pilc protein has homology to inner membrane proteins required for tfp pilus assembly in other organisms. pild is predicted to be the prepilin peptidase. these genes are in an operon, which necessitates the construction of non-polar mutants in order to carefully define the role of each gene product.

in nthi, non-polar mutants have been constructed using the non-polar kanamycin resistance cassette designed by menard et al  <cit> , see for example mason et al  <cit> . this kanamycin resistance gene is promoter-less; thus, transcription is driven from the promoter of the operon. the level of transcription must therefore be at a level sufficient to confer a kanamycin-resistant phenotype to the mutant under normal growth conditions. alternatively, a non-polar mutant can be constructed in two steps. first, a mutant is constructed using standard methodologies  <cit>  in which a gene has been interrupted with a cassette containing both a selectable and counter-selectable marker. then, dna containing an in-frame deletion of the gene of interest together with flanking chromosomal dna 5' and 3' of the deleted gene is transformed into the mutant. mutants containing the in-frame deletion are isolated by selection against the counter-selectable marker. neither of these methodologies is suitable for use with genes whose products are required for transformation since the genes are poorly expressed under normal growth conditions and mutants deficient in the expression of these genes cannot be transformed. we thus adapted the methodologies employed by wanner and coworkers  <cit>  to construct non-polar mutations in nthi.

RESULTS
construction of a non-polar mutant in the nthi pila gene
mutations have been engineered into the e. coli chromosome using the lambda phage recombinase to catalyze the site-specific insertion of a pcr amplicon containing  <dig> bp homology arms and a cassette flanked by frt  sites, replacing the gene of interest  <cit> . given the restriction barriers present in nthi strains, it was necessary to perform the insertional inactivation of the nthi genes of interest by cloning the gene together with flanking sequences onto a plasmid, then insertionally inactivating the gene in e. coli before moving the mutation into nthi using the natural transformation system  <cit> . e. coli strain dy <dig> has previously been used for engineering plasmids using the products of the phage lambda recombinase genes  <cit> . this strain is lysogenized with a defective lambda phage that expresses the recombinase genes under the control of the temperature sensitive λci <dig> repressor and thus is a suitable host for recombineering  <cit> . in order to construct a pila mutation in nthi, the pil gene cluster was first amplified from nthi strain  <dig>  then cloned into pgem-t easy and transformed into e. coli strain dy <dig> to form strain dy <dig> 

the plasmid pkd <dig> contains the kanamycin resistance gene from tn <dig> flanked by frt sites recognized by the flp recombinase  <cit> . we modified pkd <dig> so that it contained a spectinomycin resistance gene; in nthi, spectinomycin provides a strong selectable marker with little background. the normal allele of an rpsl gene from neisseria gonorrhoeae  was also added to the construct to provide a counter selectable marker  <cit> . this plasmid was designated prsm <dig>  employing prsm <dig> as a template, a pcr amplicon was generated using the strategy of baba et al  <cit> . the 5' primer was designed to include  <dig> nt 5' to and including the atg start codon of the pila gene. the 3' primer was designed to contain the complement of the last  <dig> nt including the stop codon of the pila gene. both primers contained regions homologous to the cassette containing the spectinomycin resistance gene and the rpslng gene . the amplicon  was electroporated into e. coli strain dy <dig> after heat shock and spectinomycin-resistant clones were isolated. a plasmid containing the anticipated insertion/deletion mutation in the pila gene was saved as prsm <dig> .

nthi strain  <dig> is a well-characterized isolate from a patient with chronic bronchitis  <cit> . the prsm <dig> insert was separated from the plasmid backbone by digestion with ncoi and nsii, then transformed into a streptomycin-resistant derivative of nthi strain  <dig>  designated nthi strain  <dig> rpsl, using the miv methodology  <cit> . a strain containing the anticipated insertion/deletion mutation in the pila gene was saved as nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila::spec-rpslng. the next step in the construction was the removal of the cassette, which is flanked by frt sites, by expression of the flp recombinase.

we constructed a temperature sensitive derivative of pls <dig>  a plasmid that replicates in nthi and cloned the flp recombinase gene into this construct under control of the tet operator/repressor . this plasmid, designated prsm <dig>  was electroporated into nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila::spec-rpslng and kanamycin resistant clones were isolated. one clone was saved as nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila::spec-rpslng . expression of the flp recombinase was induced in this strain, then clones were isolated at 37°c on streptomycin-containing medium. one streptomycin-resistant clone was saved as nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila for further characterization. the pil region in the mutant is represented in figure 2d.

the nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila mutant was not transformable; the phenotype was complemented by the pila gene
the product of the genes in the pil gene cluster is required for transformation using the miv methodology  <cit> . transformability of the Δpila mutant was tested using a modification of the miv methodology  <cit> . in order to generate a dna substrate for transformation, we cloned, then insertionally inactivated, the h. influenzae strain rd cya gene with a non-polar kanamycin cassette to form prsm <dig> . plasmids were digested with noti. the linear dna fragment containing the interrupted cya gene was transformed into the nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila and strain  <dig> rpsl using the modified miv methodology. transformants were selected on chocolate agar containing kanamycin. transformation efficiency  is shown in table  <dig>  approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> transformants/μg of dna was obtained with strain  <dig> rpsl, while transformants were not detected with the mutant under these conditions. we cloned the pila gene into a shuttle vector forming prsm <dig> and electroporated the construct into nthi strain  <dig> rpslΔpila. we then tested the transformability of the complemented strain using the interrupted cya gene as described above. approximately  <dig>  ×  <dig> transformants/μg of dna was obtained with the complemented strain .

nd is not detected.

although the putative functions of the pilb, pilc and pild genes make it likely that the products of these genes are required for transformation, we demonstrated that a polar mutation in the pila gene could not be complemented with plasmid prsm <dig>  the plasmid expressing the pila gene. a polar pila mutant, designated  <dig> pila::Ωkm <dig>  was constructed by insertion of the Ωkm <dig> cassette into the pila gene as described  <cit> . as anticipated, this mutant is not transformable and the mutation could not be complemented with the cloned pila gene .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new methodology for the construction of mutants in nthi. this methodology was developed to overcome technical issues related to the construction of non-polar mutants in poorly expressed genes whose products are required for transformation. however, the method is straightforward and robust. we have successfully constructed over  <dig> mutants using this method and now construct all h. influenzae mutants in our laboratory using this method. the methodology should also be applicable to other naturally transformable members of the pasteurellaceae family that support the replication of pls <dig> derivatives.
