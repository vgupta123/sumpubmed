BACKGROUND
low temperatures  are used in wine fermentations to enhance production and to retain flavor volatiles. in this way, white and “rosé” wines of greater aromatic complexity can be achieved  <cit> . however, lowering fermentation temperatures has its disadvantages, including prolonged process duration and a higher risk of halted or sluggish fermentation  <cit> . these problems can be avoided by providing better-adapted yeasts to ferment at low temperature. although the wine industry already has yeasts that are sold as cryotolerant strains, most do not offer desirable fermentation performance at low temperature  <cit> . thus, the selection of yeast able to ferment at low temperature is still of much interest for the winemaking industry . nevertheless, regarding low temperature fermentation, natural phenotypic diversity can be very limited in s. cerevisiae strains, the least psychrotrophic species of the saccharomyces genus  <cit> . an appealing alternative is the development of genetically improved new strains of s. cerevisiae that are better adapted to grow at low temperature.

in recent decades, many efforts have been made to engineer wine yeast strains with improved characteristics . however, metabolic engineering based on recombinant technology has its limitations: 1) requirement for extensive biochemical and genetic information of the metabolism of interest; 2) the complexity of the cellular physiological response, such as activation of an alternative metabolic pathway; 3) cloning difficulties in industrial strains, which result mainly from their genetic complexity; 4) regulatory issues such as using genetically modified organisms  in the food industry  <cit> . nonrecombinant strategies based on evolutionary engineering are attractive because they may generate improved strains that are not considered gmos, and will most likely be better accepted by the general public. evolutionary engineering has been used for generating new industrial strains . bioethanol production is the most important area where this approach has been applied in yeast. however, very few studies have reported the development of improved wine yeast strains through evolutionary engineering .

experiments for many generations, under conditions to which yeasts are not optimally adapted, help select for more fit genetic variants. culturing s. cerevisiae populations under long-term selective pressures results in a series of adaptive shifts. these shifts have been observed to occur on the order of once in every  <dig> generations  <cit> . the initial  mutagenesis of the starting culture potentiates increased genetic diversity  <cit> . such experiments have also shed light on a bigger question about the molecular basis underlying the improved phenotype. evolutionary engineering provides the opportunity to study evolutionary adaptation by analyzing either changes in gene expression patterns following adaptive evolution in yeast, or the genome structure and organization or the whole genome sequence of the evolved strains  <cit> .

the first aim of this study was to assess the most competitive strains that grow under wine fermentation conditions at low temperature. to this end, we performed a growth competition assay with  <dig> commercial wine strains inoculated at equal population size in synthetic grape must. in spite of the economical and industrial importance of these strains, their phenotypic variation in the main enological traits, particularly those related to optimum growth temperature  <cit> , and their ability to adapt to low temperature fermentation have been poorly investigated. the second goal was to obtain an improved strain to grow and ferment at low temperature by evolutionary engineering. for this purpose, we maintained growth competition in synthetic grape must during  <dig> generations to select for the mutations that produce phenotypes with improved growth in this medium. one of these evolved cultures was previously treated with ethyl methanesulfonate  to increase the mutation rate. finally, we aimed to decipher the molecular basis underlying this improvement by analyzing the genomic and transcriptional differences between the parental strain and the strain evolved at low temperature.

RESULTS
competition and adaptive laboratory evolution at low temperature of a mixed culture of wine yeasts
the growth of batch cultures at 12 °c was monitored during the whole competition and selection process . the growth improvement of cultures was evidenced by the continuous increase of the maximum od  and the reduction in the generation time  throughout the first  <dig> generations. no clear growth improvements were observed between  <dig> and  <dig> generations, with fluctuations in the odmax and gt values. in any case, the odmax value after  <dig> generations of growth in sm at 12 °c was approximately 2-fold that of odmax at the beginning of both the nonmutagenized and mutagenized cultures.fig.  <dig> growth evolution during competition and experimental evolution experiments. evolution of growth  in batch selection cultures in a synthetic must at 12 °c with no mutagenesis treatment  and with ems mutagenesis treatment 



this growth improvement in the serial batch cultures can be explained firstly by the imposition of the most competent strain of the mixed culture, and secondly by the evolution of these strains under selective cold pressure. monitoring the  <dig> strains throughout the  <dig> generations confirmed the first hypothesis . after  <dig> generations, only seven and nine strains were detected in the nonems and ems cultures, respectively. furthermore, major strain p <dig> already represented more than 50 % in both cultures. only three strains were detected at generation  <dig>  with p <dig> representing 57 % and 85 % in the nonmutagenized and mutagenized cultures, respectively. from generation  <dig> to  <dig>  only strains p <dig> and p <dig> were detected in both cultures, and p <dig> was the major strain with percentages over 90 % at the end of the experiment.

fermentation performance of evolved strains in different synthetic and natural grape musts
the fermentation performance of the two strains isolated at the end of the serial batch cultures  was analyzed. to distinguish between the strains isolated from the non-mutagenized or the mutagenized culture and the parental strains, the evolved strains were complemented with codes -e  and em , respectively. the fermentation kinetics of the original and evolved strains was estimated by calculating the time needed to ferment 5 % , 50 %  and 100 %  of sugars in sm <dig>  and is graphically plotted in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> approximately match the beginning , middle  and end of fermentation, respectively.table  <dig> determination of the time required by the evolved and original strains to ferment 5 % , 50 %  and 100 %  of the initial sugar content in a synthetic must  at 12 °c and 28 °c

all the evolved strains showed better fermentation performance than the original strains at 12 °c . the most remarkable improvement in the time to complete the low-temperature fermentation was observed in p5-em. this strain took around 350 h to finish fermentation, whereas parental strain p <dig> was unable to consume all the sugars after 30 days  of fermentation. strain p5-em also reached a maximum od that was 2-fold higher than original strain p <dig> . the other evolved strains, p5-e, p17-e and p17-em, exhibited similar fermentative behavior, and finished fermentations in more than 500 h. in any case, these three evolved strains also displayed improved fermentation performance and biomass production  than the parental strains at low temperature . conversely, these differences in the growth rate and fermentation were absent or minimal during the fermentations at 28 °c.

in an attempt to take a step forward to approach wine industrial conditions, fermentations were carried out with the evolved strains in three natural grape musts . quite surprisingly, we did not observe any differences in fermentation performance between the evolved and parental strains under these conditions . these results encouraged us to check the fermentation performance of evolved strain p5-em at 12 °c in a new synthetic grape must , where ynb was replaced with a defined concentration of mineral salts and vitamins . as in the natural grape musts, no differences in both fermentation rate and biomass production were observed between the original and evolved strains.

determining the limiting nutrient at low temperature in sm1
the different fitness noted between the parental and evolved strains observed in sm <dig>  but not in sm <dig>  should be explained by the presence of a limiting nutrient  or inhibitor  in this medium, and the evolution process had adapted strains to overcome this limitation/inhibition. it should be borne in mind that the evolution process was performed in the sm <dig> medium. in order to determine the limiting nutrient in sm <dig> at 12 °c, we carried out the fermentations of p <dig> and p5-em using sm <dig> amended with every single compound that varied between both synthetic musts . the limiting nutrient was determined as inositol because we observed a recovered phenotype of the parental strain when inositol was added at the same concentration as in sm <dig> . remarkably, addition of only inositol to sm <dig> resulted in the same fermentation and growth performance between both strains, and the fitness advantage of p5-em disappeared . moreover, the odmax at 12 °c of the parental strain correlated positively with an increasing inositol concentration , whereas the evolved strain odmax correlated negatively with an increasing inositol concentration  .fig.  <dig> population dynamics of p <dig> and p5-em in sm <dig> and sm1 + i musts. cell percentages of p <dig>  and p5-em  during the competition fermentations in sm <dig>  and sm1 + inositol   at 12 °c  and 28 °c

the transcriptomic analysis of evolved strain p5-em highlighted the strong up-regulation of mannoprotein genes
the global gene expression of p5-em was analyzed during the sm <dig> fermentation at 12 °c and compared with its parental strain p <dig>  the physiological condition chosen for analyzing the gene expression was the mid-exponential growth phase . the comparative results of the transcriptional profiles revealed that only  <dig>  %  of yeast genes showed significant differences in the transcript levels of at least 2-fold . of these,  <dig> genes displayed a reduced expression in the evolved strain compared to the parental one, whereas only  <dig> genes exhibited an increased expression in p5-em.

a mips categories analysis was done with the up- and down-regulated genes . the largest percentage of the up-regulated genes in p5-em belonged to the functional category “metabolism”  and the sub-category “c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism” . among the down-regulated genes, functional categories “transcription” and “protein with binding function or cofactor requirement” gave the largest percentages of genes .

when we focused on the most strongly up-regulated genes in p5-em , four belonged to the dan/tir family , which are cell wall mannoprotein genes, widely linked to a low temperature response  <cit> . hpf <dig>  which encodes a mannoprotein that performs protective functions against protein aggregation in wines  <cit> , also appeared among these top-ten up-regulated genes. the highest down-regulated genes  were: sfc <dig> ; git <dig> ; and put <dig> .fig.  <dig> major differences of transcriptomics analysis. the  <dig> most up-regulated  and down-regulated  genes in p5-em  compared to p <dig>  during the fermentation at 12 °c



metabolic changes in mannoprotein content and lipid composition
as the transcriptomic analysis revealed this strong up-regulation of several mannoprotein genes, the amount of extracellular and cellular mannoproteins was determined during the fermentations of sm <dig> and sm <dig> supplemented with inositol  at 28 °c and 12 °c respectively . evolved strain p5-em released more mannoproteins to the growth medium because the wines fermented with this strain presented higher mannoprotein content, regardless of temperature. however, the greatest increase in mannoprotein content occurred with the enrichment of synthetic grape must with inositol. the final sm1 + i wines had mannoprotein concentrations of around 2- and 3-fold more than the sm <dig> wines. it is noteworthy that the cellular mannoprotein content  correlated negatively with content in wines . the strains grown in the inositol-limited medium  obtained a higher cellular concentration than the cells grown in excess inositol . evolved strain p5-em also showed higher cellular concentrations than parental strain p <dig> fig.  <dig> mannoprotein content. final concentrations of mannoprotein  released by p <dig> and p5-em during the fermentation at 28 °c and 12 °c in sm <dig> and sm1 + inositol

likewise, the phospholipid composition of the parental and evolved strains was also determined during fermentation in both media with limited and excess inositol. the percentage of the main phospholipid classes and their distribution in the different molecular species  are shown in tables  <dig> and additional file 7: table s <dig>  respectively. in order to highlight the most important changes between strains, temperature and fermentation medium according to their phospholipid composition, a principal component analysis  was performed on the  <dig> individual samples obtained  . the two first components were retained and explained  <dig>  % of total variance. the first component explained  <dig>  % of variance and was marked by high positive component loadings for pc   and pc  . the second component explained  <dig>  % of variation and was marked by positive components loadings for pi   and pi  , and by high negative loadings for pc   and pc  . the general ordination of the samples by pca showed the formation of two groups along the first axis: sm <dig>  associated with high values of pc  and pc ; sm1 + i, associated with high values of pi  and pi . within the sm1 + i group, another separation was observed due to temperature. low-temperature samples were associated with high values of pc  and pc . a similar pattern was observed within the sm <dig> group, but the p <dig> samples at 12 °c were grouped with the 28 °c samples.table  <dig> percentage of phospholipids  expressed as the mean ± sem  of total cellular concentration of these compounds. cellular concentration of total phospholipid  expressed as nmol/mg of dry weight. significant differences , bold letters, was examined with t-test and was compared p5-em with p <dig> strain in each condition

several of the above-mentioned results indicated that the snp in gaa <dig> might explain the phenotypic differences observed between p5-em and p <dig>  this gene encodes a subunit of the gpi-protein transamidase complex, required to attach glycosylphosphatidylinositol  to the proteins in the er, a mechanism by which proteins are attached to the cell surface in all eukaryotic cells. to check the relevance of this mutation, we constructed a site-directed mutant in gaa <dig> to gaa1thr <dig> in a derivative haploid of parental strain p <dig>  we analyzed the fermentation performance of p <dig> gaa1thr <dig> at 12 °c and 28 °c, which was compared with derivative haploid p <dig> 

the fermentation kinetics of both strains was estimated by calculating the time needed to ferment 5 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 %  and 100 %  of the sugars in sm <dig>  as previously observed for parental strain p <dig>  its haploid was also unable to finish fermentation at 12 °c, whereas p <dig> gaa1thr <dig> completed fermentation. the percentage of improvement at t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> during the fermentation at 12 °c of p <dig> gaa1thr <dig> and p5-em, in comparison to their respective parental strains, is plotted graphically in figure  <dig>  the results showed that p5-em improved 50 % at t <dig>  whereas the only mutation in gaa1thr <dig> resulted in a 10 % improvement at t <dig>  demonstrating that other mutations in addition to gaa1thr <dig> are required to explain all of the improvement in fermentation in the evolved strain. at 28 °c, only strain p5-em showed a slight improvement at t <dig> . at the remaining time points analyzed at 28 °c, the parental strain mostly performed better than p5-em and p <dig> gaa1thr <dig> fig.  <dig> dynamics of improvement in fermentation performance at 12 °c. percentage of improvement in the fermentation kinetics at 12 °c  of p5-em and p <dig> gaa1

discussion
in this study we used a batch serial dilution in a context that mimicked wine fermentation conditions at 12 °c to perform a competition experiment and experimental evolution. with this strategy, we attempted to select the most competent strains during the first generations, whereas longer exposure to low temperature led to an evolutionary adaptation of the genome of the previously selected strain/s. monitoring strain diversity revealed that strain p <dig> was extremely competent very early in serial batch cultures. the mutational changes that led this strain to better adapt to low temperature fermentations were also denoted by improvements in growth parameters during the first  <dig> generations of the serial batch cultures. subsequently, the fermentation test carried out in the same medium used for the evolution experiment confirmed the genetic improvement of this strain to grow and ferment at low temperature. however, it proved somewhat disappointing when we checked that this improvement in the growth and fermentation rates only happened in the context of the selection medium . we used ynb in this medium to provide the microelements  needed for yeast growth and found the higher demand for inositol to grow at low temperature converted this vitamin into a growth-limiting substrate. inositol is an essential phospholipid precursor in yeast cells and could be incorporated into phosphatidylinositol , sphingolipids and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors  <cit> . it is known that phospholipid composition plays an essential role in adaptation to low-temperature fermentations  <cit> . therefore, our results evidenced that evolved strain p5-em has a fitness advantage in this inositol limitation context at low temperature. this advantage was lost in excess inositol or at an optimum temperature. steensels et al.  <cit>  previously stressed the importance of selection conditions matching the industrial parameters as closely as possible and, concerning to inositol content, sm <dig> did not show enough resemblance with natural grape must. in spite of this unexpected result, the strategy followed in this study provides evidence for the utility of competition experiments for detecting the most competitive strains among a pool of commercial strains, as well as evolutionary engineering as a nonrecombinant technique to isolate the commercial wine yeast strains that are highly tailored to stressful low-temperature wine fermentation conditions. in industrial settings, cells often face combinations of different stresses  <cit> . during wine fermentations, for example, cells encounter osmotic stress, high ethanol levels and nutrient deprivation. through selection steps under conditions that resemble this harsh environment, researchers have succeeded in improving wine strains by evolutionary engineering .

apart from the importance of obtaining improved strains to be used during wine fermentations in industry, another important aim of this study was to detect the physiological and molecular bases underlying this improved phenotype. for this purpose, metabolic, transcriptomic and genomic changes in evolved strain p5-em were determined in comparison to parental strain p <dig>  as mentioned above, our results clearly provide evidence for a higher demand for inositol when cells grew at low temperature. however the evolved strain was able to bypass this inositol requirement, to the extent that a negative correlation between inositol concentration and growth of this strain was observed. wenger et al.  <cit>  formerly reported that organisms adaptively evolved in limiting-nutrient environments perform worse than their ancestors in some cases when resources are nonlimiting. these trade-offs may result from either the adaptive mutations themselves or the accumulation of conditional loss-of-function mutations elsewhere in the genome.

incubation at low temperature increases the molecular order of membrane lipids by rigidification  <cit> . yeast responds to this rigidification by adapting different changes in the membrane lipid composition to maintain appropriate membrane fluidity. nevertheless, inositol limitation denoted incapacity to reshape its lipid composition in the parental p <dig> strain. the inositol used in the synthesis of pi is either produced from glucose-6-phosphate or imported from the culture medium. thus the fitness advantage observed in the evolved strain could potentially be explained by the optimization of the synthesis route to counteract the limitation of inositol in the culture medium. however we detected neither transcriptomic difference nor genomic changes in the genes involved in inositol biosynthesis or transport. the only likely exception was the strong down-regulation of git <dig> observed in the evolved strain. this gene encodes a plasma membrane permease that mediates the uptake of glycerophosphoinositol and glycerophosphocholine as a source of inositol and phosphate  <cit> . the lower inositol requirement of this strain could lead to down regulation of a gene involved in the transport of compounds that can be used as inositol sources. yet, regardless of the direct involvement of inositol in the synthesis of pi, we should bear in mind its crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of many phospholipid biosynthesis genes  <cit> . the general impact of inositol on phospholipid biosynthesis was revealed by the differences found in the total phospholipid content in strain p <dig> growing at low temperature . somehow the evolved strain is not subjected to this tight regulation by inositol because this strain showed similar phospholipid content when grown at low temperature in both media.

another metabolic change in the evolved strain was the increase noted in extracellular and intracellular mannoprotein contents. these mannoproteins are attached to the cell wall via glycosilphosphatidylinositol  moieties, and are essential for cell wall integrity  <cit>  and cell viability  <cit> . the gpi anchor is synthesized from pi through multiple steps in the er and it is then transferred to the c terminus of proteins bearing a gpi attachment signal sequence. gaa <dig> encodes a subunit of the gpi-protein transamidase complex, which is required for the attachment of a completed gpi anchor to proteins  <cit> . we have shown how the introduction of allele gaa1thr <dig>  detected in the evolved strain, into the parental strain represents a 10 % improvement in fermentation time. this single point-mutation can partially explain the improved fermentation behavior observed in the evolved strain at low temperature. obviously, this snp was unable to completely reproduce the fermentation improvement observed in the evolved strain, which indicates the existence of other genetic determinants of cold adaptation. the results presented herein provide valuable additional genes, which can be used as a starting point for future efforts to disentangle the genetic basis of low temperature adaptation.

regardless of the possible connection between the deficient synthesis of gpi-anchored proteins and a lower fitness at low temperature, our results suggested the direct involvement of mannoproteins in cold adaptation. the overexpression of the mannoprotein genes in the evolved strain was related with increased mannoprotein content in the cell wall and an increase in the mannoprotein released at the end of fermentation. the induction of a subset of dan/tir genes has been previously related to hypoxia, high pressure and low temperature conditions  <cit> . in a recent work, we also detected that the overexpression of tip <dig> and tir <dig> improved fermentation activity and growth at 12 °c  <cit> . abramova et al.  <cit>  postulated that this adaptation event is related either to membrane fluidity and affects membrane properties, or, some of these proteins play a role in sterol transport.

further indirect molecular evidence for the better fitness of the evolved strain at low temperature was the up-regulation of functional categories, such as “c-compound and carbohydrate metabolism” and “cytokinesis /septum formation and hydrolysis”, which can explain the higher fermentation and growth rates observed in this strain. in order to find out other experimental situations that provoke a similar gene expression response to that obtained in this study, we used the spell tool via the saccharomyces genome database   <cit> . interestingly, the datasets from published microarray experiments, whose expression profiles most closely resemble our data, dealt with the impact of mannose and inositol pyrophosphate on carbon utilization, protein glycosylation and environmental stress response  <cit> . this result provided additional support for a correlation between transcriptomic data and inositol and mannoprotein metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
our data provide clear evidence for the greater requirement for inositol for s. cerevisiae growth at low temperature. we evolved a commercial wine strain in an inositol-limiting environment at low temperature. both the growth capacity and fermentation activity of this strain improved at low temperature, and showed clear physiological and molecular changes in comparison with its parental strain. the capacity to reshape its membrane lipid composition and a better mannoprotein synthesis capacity seemed to be paramount for this strain’s cold adaptation. the mutation observed in gene gaa <dig>  involved in the synthesis of the gpi-anchored proteins, partially explained the improvement observed in the evolved strain. we also provide a short list of candidate genes for further exploration in the search for mechanisms involved in low-temperature adaptation in industrial yeasts.
