BACKGROUND
enterococci have emerged as prominent nosocomial pathogens that cause a variety of clinical infections. enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are clinically significant species that are implicated in 90% and 5–10% of enterococcal infections, respectively  <cit> .

the widespread use and misuse of antimicrobials such as glycopeptides and aminoglycosides in human and livestock have resulted in the rapid increase of vancomycin and high level gentamicin-resistance in enterococcus strains  <cit> . vancomycin-resistant enterococci  were first isolated from patients in  <dig> in the united kingdom and france  <cit> . since then, vre have spread to many other countries including malaysia, in the meat from livestock and by humans  <cit> .

vancomycin resistance in enterococci have been classified based on the gene sequence and resistance characteristics  <cit> . the vana-type strains are resistant to high levels of both vancomycin and teicoplanin antimicrobials . vanb-type strains are resistant to a wide range of vancomycin concentration  and are susceptible to teicoplanin. vand-type strains are resistant to moderate levels of vancomycin  and susceptible to teicoplanin, while vanc, vane, and vang-type strains exhibit low-level resistance to vancomycin  <cit> . high level gentamicin resistance  phenotype is due to the expression of bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes  that are encoded by the aaca-aphd gene   <cit> .

enterococcal infections are treated with ampicillin only or with a combination of ampicillin and aminoglycoside to achieve synergistic bactericidal activity. however, for patients who are allergic to penicillin or are infected by bacteria with high resistance to ampicillin and aminoglycosides, vancomycin is the powerful, last resort and alternative drug of choice. intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides is an inherent property of enterococci. however, the prevalence of high level gentamicin resistance in enterococci is predictive of a loss of synergy between gentamicin and cell wall active agent such as ampicillin or vancomycin  <cit> .

nucleic acid-based tests using pcr are increasingly being used in laboratories to replace time-consuming, labor-intensive and less sensitive conventional diagnostic methods such as biochemical identification and kirby-bauer antimicrobial susceptibility tests. various pcr methods have been developed to identify the  enterococcus genus  <cit> ,  vancomycin resistance  <cit> , and  high level aminoglycoside resistance  <cit> . the above methods do not detect all of the above mentioned targets simultaneously. hence, the present study was focused to design a nanoplex pcr of vancomycin and bifunctional aminoglycoside resistant enterococci  with an internal control for the detection of  enterococcus genus and clinically important enterococcus spp., namely e. faecalis and e. faecium,  most common vancomycin resistant genotypes namely vana, b, c, d and  high level gentamicin resistance. in order to rule out false negative results, an internal control was also included in the nanoplex pcr assay.

RESULTS
in the present study the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr was optimized successfully to identify  <dig> genes of enterococcus genus, species , vancomycin resistance  and high level gentamicin resistance  simultaneously. stepwise optimization of primer concentration, annealing temperature, mgcl <dig>  dntp and taq polymerase was done. the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr gave the best results when  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm dntp,  <dig> u taq polymerase and 65°c annealing temperature was used.

the analytical sensitivity of the nanoplex pcr at the dna level was found to be  <dig> ng of dna , whereas at the bacterial level it was found to be  <dig> cfu/ml .

the analytical specificity of the nanoplex pcr assay at the genus level was determined using  <dig> enterococcal reference strains and found to be positive for the enterococcus genus specific 16s rrna gene. a representative gel picture of v-bia-re with reference strains is shown in figure  <dig>  while the other  <dig> gram-positive and  <dig> gram-negative strains were negative. at the species level, all the reference strains of e. faecalis and e. faecium were positive for ddl gene by nanoplex pcr, while other enterococcus species were negative . the vancomycin and gentamicin resistant reference strains were positive for vana, vanb, vanc, vand or aaca-aphd genes by nanoplex pcr. however, the vancomycin and gentamicin sensitive reference strains were negative for vana, vanb, vanc, vand or aaca-aphd genes by nanoplex pcr . overall, the analytical specificity of nanoplex pcr was 100% for the detection of vancomycin and gentamicin resistant reference strains.

the dna sequencing results of the pcr amplicon for the  <dig> genes were contig aligned using the contigexpress aligment program and were analyzed by blast. the results showed that all  <dig> pcr amplicons were specific to their respective genes and had 91–100% sequence identity with the existing genbank sequences.

upon completion of the standardization of the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr with reference strains, the assay was validated with  <dig> clinical isolates. among the  <dig> clinical isolates  <dig>  were found to be e. faecalis and only  <dig>  were e. faecium. of the five e. faecium isolates, four were from blood samples and one was from urine sample. of the remaining  <dig> e. faecalis isolates,  <dig> were from blood samples,  <dig> from urine samples,  <dig> from pus samples,  <dig> from high vaginal swab samples,  <dig> from body fluid samples,  <dig> from a peritoneum dialysis fluid sample and  <dig> from urine catheter samples. thus, the clinical isolates had a high percentage of e. faecalis infections. however, none of the clinical enterococcus isolates showed vancomycin resistance.

among the  <dig> enterococci isolates,  <dig> had aaca-aphd gene by v-bia-re nanoplex pcr. of the  <dig> isolates,  <dig> were e. faecalis while  <dig> were e. faecium. however, by the conventional antimicrobial susceptibility method  <dig> of them were hlgr enterococci . one of the e. faecium isolate that was positive for aaca-aphd gene by nanoplex pcr was found to be sensitive to gentamicin by conventional mic method. though genotypically the aaca-aphd gene was detected and confirmed by pcr and sequencing, it is possible that the aaca-aphd gene is non-functional and is not expressed phenotypically or due to the presence of pseudogene  <cit> .

the diagnostic accuracy of v-bia-re nanoplex pcr at the genus and species level was determined using  <dig> clinical isolates and found to have 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. however, the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr for the aaca-aphd gene detection showed  <dig> % sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive and  <dig> % negative predictive values in detecting hlgr enterococci.

discussion
the present study is unique since it is the first study where we have developed a combined molecular test for the determination of the enterococcus genus, two clinically important species  and vana-d genotypes and high level gentamicin resistance  simultaneously. currently the available assay is able to detect either gentamicin or vancomycin resistance  <cit> . though there are numerous reports on pcr assays for the detection of vres  <cit> , only few of them have incorporated internal controls in their assays to rule out false negatives  <cit> . according to clsi guidelines for molecular diagnostic methods for infectious diseases , incorporation of an internal control in the reaction is essential for the diagnostic test to exclude false negative result or the presence of inhibitors  <cit> . in the present study, the inclusion of the  <dig> bp internal control in the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay helped us to rule out false negatives or pcr inhibitors.

the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr was found to be 100% sensitive and specific in detecting known vancomycin and gentamicin resistance genes in enterococcal strains. the use of v-bia-re pcr as a diagnostic tool was also studied by analyzing  <dig> clinical isolates obtained from  <dig> different hospitals in malaysia. we found that most of them were e. faecalis  and all of them were susceptible to vancomycin. however, 26% were resistant to hlgr. these results are consistent with results of other groups, where they have shown that e. faecalis is predominant among the clinical isolates and were vancomycin sensitive though some were hlgr enterococci  <cit> .

in malaysia the presence of vres has been reported from clinical  <cit>  and farm animal samples  <cit> . sporadic cases of vre infection and colonization have also been reported in the neighboring country, singapore  <cit> . since antimicrobial-resistant enterococci have been detected in livestock in malaysia, there could be a possible epidemiological link between livestock origin and human infections  <cit> . hence, characterization of vre isolates from human stools and livestock animals is needed, especially in areas where antibiotics can be obtained from any drug store or over-the-counter and where farmers feed their chickens with antibiotics to promote growth  <cit> .

the percentage of hlgr enterococci observed in this study  is relatively lower than those reported in china   <cit>  and greece   <cit> . in both studies, the hlgr enterococci were mostly associated with the presence of aaca-aphd gene as observed in this study.

genomic dna extracted from two of the e. coli  strains found to have vanb gene like products . it has been documented that the e. coli possess homologous genes called ddla and ddlb  that have 29–38% amino acid identity to vana and vanc genes  <cit> . however sequencing of these pcr product revealed that it is similar to a hypothetical protein present in e. coli  and is not related to ddla/ddlb genes of e. coli. it is possible that in the nanoplex pcr assay, the presence of  <dig> pairs of primers might have lead to non-specific pcr product. these types of false positive results do not arise when enterococci broth is used as an enrichment medium, since this medium is known to inhibit gram-negative bacterial  growth.

the limitations of the conventional antimicrobial susceptibility tests are that the susceptibility pattern varies with inoculum size. in addition, there is no standardized mic cut-off value available for vana, vanb, vanc1/c2/c <dig> and vand in conventional antimicrobial susceptibility tests. currently, it is not a usual practice in laboratories to identify the species of enterococcus, except in cases of septicemia. genotype-based molecular tests can overcome the limitation, where the presence of the gene is accurately detected when the cfus of the bacteria are more than the analytical sensitivity level. moreover, rapid detection of antibiotic resistant bacteria is important not only for therapeutic decisions, but also for infection control  <cit> .

the vane and vang primers were not included in the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr since these genotypes are not common among enterococcus spp.  <cit> . the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay developed in the present study will be useful in the epidemiological screening of vre carriers or reservoirs. we are currently evaluating this assay for screening vre carriage in human stools and poultry farms in malaysia.

CONCLUSIONS
bacterial lysates prepared by a simple boiling method without lysis buffer and lytic enzymes were used as templates in the v-bia-re nanoplex pcr assay. the pcr assay was able to detect  <dig> genes that are essential for the identification of the most common enterococci spp. and their vancomycin and gentamicin resistance genotypes simultaneously in a single test within  <dig> hours. the built-in internal control in this assay prevents the false negative cases. the diagnostic accuracy was determined using the  <dig> clinical specimens which showed 97% of the clinical isolates belonged to e. faecalis, of which 26% showed hlgr genotype, but none were vancomycin resistant. hence, this test can be used as an effective diagnostic and surveillance tool to monitor the spread and emergence of vre.
