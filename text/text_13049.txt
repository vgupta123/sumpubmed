BACKGROUND
one of the major sources of human salmonella infection is meat, including pork and poultry  <cit>  and therefore efficient and rapid monitoring of salmonella in the meat production chain is necessary. traditional bacteriological detection of salmonella in foods and environmental samples is costly, laborious, and time-consuming, requiring 3– <dig> days to obtain a confirmed result  <cit> . thus, rapid and cost-effective detection of salmonella is of major interest to the food industry and the public. real-time pcr technology offers several advantages compared with classical bacteriology in terms of speed, detection limit, potential for automation, and cost  <cit> . however, it is essential that new pcr methods are reliable, robust and comply with the legislative demand of detecting as few as one salmonella bacterium per 25-g sample. furthermore, they should be validated against reference culture methods, and last, but not least, be sufficiently robust to be transferred from the expert laboratory to end users.

there are several real-time pcr methods available for the detection of salmonella in various kinds of food  <cit>  and carcass swabs  <cit> . furthermore, a number of commercial real-time pcr systems have been validated for testing of salmonella in meat and swab samples  <cit> . some of these systems detect salmonella as fast as 9– <dig> h in meat samples , but the total time for analysis of carcass swab samples is 17– <dig> h. recently, a non-commercial real-time pcr method for detection of salmonella in milk powder  <cit>  has been validated in a multicenter trial. however, to our knowledge, there are no reports on multicenter validation trials where non-commercial methods are evaluated for the detection of salmonella in meat or carcass swabs using real-time pcr.

the objective of this study was to validate a previously developed real-time pcr method  <cit>  for use as a routine and on-site analysis method for the meat industry. the validation study was performed according to the protocol recommended by the validation body of the nordic countries   <cit> , including comparative and collaborative trials on minced pork and veal meat, chicken neck-skins and pig carcass swab samples. the method is based on a shortened  pre-enrichment in buffered peptone water  followed by automated dna purification and subsequent detection using real-time pcr. in this method, a part of the ttrrsbca locus specific for salmonella is amplified giving a high selectivity  <cit> . the pcr method used includes an internal amplification control , making it useful as a diagnostic tool. the overall time for the analysis of meat samples is  <dig> h, and for carcass swab samples  <dig> h. both time-spans are operational for two-shift work at slaughterhouses. the method has on the basis of results obtained in this study together with already published data on selectivity  <cit>  gained nordval approval and is currently being implemented at major danish meat producers.

the detection level of the two methods was 1– <dig> cfu/ <dig> g sample  in all cases except for the swabs inoculated with s. enteritidis, where it was 10– <dig> cfu/ <dig> g for the nmkl method  . to determine the relative accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, a total of  <dig> samples representing meat and environmental samples were analyzed by the pcr and nmkl methods . a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> samples gave positive results by real-time pcr, compared with a total of  <dig> by the culture-based method. two samples showed positive deviation  and one negative deviation  . a very good agreement between the two methods was obtained using cohen's kappa .

collaborative trial
the purpose of the collaborative trial was to determine the variability in the results obtained by the real-time pcr method detecting salmonella in identical samples. the trial was conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by nordval  <cit> . the samples and the other contents of the ring trial kit sent out to the participants were found to be stable during the period of the trial . the influence of the refrigerated transit was investigated prior to the collaborative trial, and no detrimental effects were found after three days .

six laboratories participated in the collaborative trial, and valid results were obtained from five of the laboratories and used for the statistical analysis . in agreement with the predefined criteria, results from one participant were excluded due to failure in the pcr analysis . the unexpected pcr results obtained by this participant were probably caused by a delay in the transport of the ring trial package . statistical analysis of the results from the remaining five laboratories gave a relative specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of 100% for all of the tested matrices at all three inoculation levels, except for the relative accuracy for swab samples which was 83% when all inoculation levels were analyzed together. for the positive control samples containing salmonella dna, a ct value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  was obtained for the five laboratories. there were small variations in the ct values obtained for duplicate samples of the same matrix at the same spiking level analyzed at each laboratory  as well as for the same sample analyzed by each laboratory .

external validation
in order to evaluate the performance of the real-time pcr method on-site, it was transferred and implemented at a production laboratory previously using pcr-based analysis with the bax system. artificially contaminated pork filet samples  were analyzed in parallel with the real-time pcr and bax methods. in general, a good agreement  was found between the two methods based on the results from the  <dig> artificially contaminated samples . the real-time pcr method detected  <dig> of the  <dig> samples inoculated with salmonella, whereas the bax system detected  <dig> of the  <dig> samples.

results from  <dig> pork meat samples inoculated with salmonella at different levels and analyzed in parallel on-site using the real-time pcr and the salmonella bax methods.

a samples with a ct value >  <dig> is considered negative if the ct value for the iac is <  <dig> and inconclusive if a ct >  <dig> is obtained for the iac. according to the method directive for the pcr method, re-analysis of the extracted dna by pcr is then needed.

discussion
the real-time pcr method validated in the present study is intended as a diagnostic tool for routine use in the meat industry, and therefore has specific demands on speed, ease of automation as well as robustness and reproducibility. furthermore, the method must be specific for salmonella and have detection limit comparable with or better than the culture-based methods in use today as official methods. using the pcr method, the total time for the analysis of salmonella in meat samples was decreased from at least  <dig> days for the standard culture-based method  <cit>  to  <dig> h for meat samples and  <dig> h for swabs. the time for analysis is comparable with the fastest validated dna-based analysis kit  on the market for meat samples and 1– <dig> h shorter for swab samples. for the meat producer, this means that the meat can be released faster, leading to decreased costs for storage and prolonged shelf life at the retailers. implementing this method would allow faster release of salmonella-free fresh meat and meat products.

the sample preparation in the pcr method consists of non-selective enrichment in bpw followed by centrifugation and automated dna extraction. the use of automated dna extraction in combination with the closed system of real-time pcr provides a fast and less laborious method with minimized risk of contamination. furthermore, the real-time pcr method can easily be adapted to include the dutp-uracil-n-glycosylase  system, minimizing the risk of carryover contamination  <cit> . the pcr reagents used in the method can be mixed in advance, distributed in smaller, ready-to-use quantities, and frozen at -20°c for up to  <dig> months  <cit> . these features are a major benefit for on-site use of the test at the slaughterhouses. the method is an open-formula technique, i.e., the reagents and target gene, etc., are known, in contrast to commercial kits. however, further decreasing the total time for analysis to below  <dig> h will certainly be even more beneficial to industry and is a challenge in the further developing of the method.

the prevalence of salmonella in danish pork meat and broiler flocks is low . therefore, samples artificially contaminated with salmonella in the exponential growth phase stressed by a cold storage overnight to simulate the condition under production of poultry and pork meat were used for the majority of the samples included in the validation study. this alternative to naturally contaminated samples is in compliance with international guidelines  <cit> . however, naturally contaminated swab samples were used for the comparative trial. the nmkl- <dig>  method  <cit>  was chosen as the reference method because it is used in the nordic countries instead of the iso 6579: <dig> method  <cit> . the difference in the two methods is that in the nmkl method only one selective enrichment media is used rappaport vassiliades soy broth  instead of two in the iso method . the methods have been determined to be equal to the respective part of the iso method  <cit> .

the real-time pcr method amplifies a part of the ttrrsbca locus used for tetrathionate respiration in salmonella. the relative selectivity of the pcr assay  has previously been found to be 100% when tested on  <dig> salmonella strains and  <dig> non-salmonella strains  <cit> . therefore, this parameter was excluded from the comparative test performed in this study, in accordance with nordval guidelines. the relative accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were evaluated for the pcr method in comparison with the standard culture-based method currently in use for detection of salmonella  <cit>  according to the nordval protocol . two of the artificially contaminated poultry neck-skins were found positive by the real-time pcr method and negative by the reference method. these samples were considered as true positives because according to iso 20838: <dig>  <cit>  no further verification of positive samples is necessary, as the real time pcr analysis contains a dna probe specific for the target salmonella gene . the relative sensitivity for the matrices meat and environmental samples, as well as when all the samples were analyzed together were above 95%, which is the limit considered acceptable according to nordval  <cit> . no recommendations concerning the levels for the relative accuracy and relative specificity are given in either the guideline  <cit>  or in the iso <dig> standard  <cit> .

in the collaborative study, complete agreement between the real-time pcr method and the culture-based reference method was obtained for all test characteristics for minced pork and veal meat as well as for poultry neck-skin samples. for carcass swabs, one of the samples that were not artificially contaminated was positive when analyzed by one of the laboratories. however, investigations after the finalization of the trial pointed to a mix-up of two samples during the set-up of the pcr plate, which presents a reasonable explanation for this false-positive result. one of the participants was excluded from the study, due to too long transportation time  which has a detrimental effect on the pcr master mix. there are some limitations to this study that should be taken into consideration when implementing the method at other laboratories. firstly, only one brand of pcr thermo cycler was used in the study. it has previously been reported that pcr results might vary considerable between different thermocyclers  <cit>  and it might be necessary to adjust reagent concentrations and the temperature program slightly to optimize the method. secondly, the enrichment step of the method was only performed at the expert laboratory and pellets were sent out for dna extraction and pcr analysis. thus the reproducibility was assessed for the dna extraction and pcr steps. this procedure was approved in advance by nordval. the participating laboratories were experienced laboratories that were familiar with culture based methodologies. however, in other guidelines for collaborative studies, such as iso  <dig>  it is recommended that the complete procedure is performed by all participating laboratories  <cit> .

in the last part of the study, the robustness of the method was verified externally for artificially contaminated pork samples. no significant difference in the result for the real-time pcr method and a commercial sybr-green pcr-based analysis system  was found. however, results were available after  <dig> h for the real-time pcr method, compared with 20– <dig> h for the bax system. in this study, two samples inoculated with a very low level  and two samples inoculated at  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g were negative in both methods, most likely indicating that no surviving salmonella actually were present in the sample. freezing at -18°c will kill some of the inoculated salmonella cells, thereby affecting the possibility for further detection using bax or the real-time pcr method. furthermore, the bax system failed to detect one sample inoculated with  <dig> cfu/ <dig> g of s. agona. the same sample was detected using the real-time pcr method although the ct value was rather high . finally, two samples  were not detected by the real-time pcr method although being positive with the bax system. for one of these samples, however, the iac was negative as well, prompting a re-examination of the sample. however, at low inoculation levels the cell number added can vary due of statistical reasons thereby affecting the probability of detection  <cit> . from these data, it can be concluded that the real-time pcr is equivalent to the bax system in detecting salmonella in artificially contaminated meat samples

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the real-time pcr method was validated in comparative and collaborative trials according to guidelines given by nordval. the pcr method was found to perform well. results from this study together with published data on selectivity of the real-time pcr assay  <cit>  formed the basis for obtaining nordval approval as an alternative method for detection of salmonella in meat and environmental  samples  <cit> . after a successful comparison with a commercially available sybr-green pcr-based method currently used by a number of meat producers, the real-time pcr method is now being implemented as a routine analysis method by leading poultry and pork producers in denmark for qualitative detection of salmonella in raw meat and carcass swabs.
