BACKGROUND
sensorineural hearing loss  is a common disability. once hearing has been lost, it is rarely recovered. the systemic application of corticosteroids has been accepted as the treatment of choice for acute snhl, although its efficacy has not been substantiated  <cit> . in general, approximately 50% of snhl cases show no response to the systemic application of corticosteroids  <cit> . hence there is an urgent need to develop alternative treatments for acute snhl. prostaglandin e <dig>  has often been used as one such treatment; however, its clinical efficacy remains controversial  <cit> . the physiological actions of pge <dig> and prostaglandin e <dig>  are mediated by the prostaglandin e receptor subtypes ep <dig>  ep <dig>  ep <dig>  and ep <dig>  <cit> . ep <dig> and ep <dig> are coupled to g-protein stimulation, and mediate increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate  that activate protein kinase a   <cit> . by contrast, the activation of ep <dig> decreases camp levels, which suggests that the selective activation of ep <dig> and/or ep <dig> might increase the clinical efficacy of pge <dig> for the treatment of acute snhl. based on these findings, we previously examined the expression of ep <dig> in the cochlea, and the potential of an ep <dig> agonist to protect the cochlea against noise-induced trauma  <cit> . our results demonstrated both ep <dig> expression in the cochlea, and cochlear protection against noise trauma as a result of the local application of an ep <dig> agonist. however, the exact mechanisms by which ep <dig> agonists act in the cochlea are presently unclear and require further research.

among their various physiological and pathophysiological functions, pge <dig> and pge <dig> are known to increase vascular endothelial growth factor  production via a camp-dependent mechanism, which is mediated by ep <dig> and ep <dig>  <cit> . vegf, which is a 45-kda heparin-binding homodimeric glycoprotein, plays roles in angiogenesis, vasodilation, differentiation, anti-apoptosis, proliferation, and vascular permeability in endothelial tissues  <cit> . it also has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in non-endothelial tissues  <cit> . recent studies have indicated that vegf also protects the cochlea against noise trauma  <cit> . based on these findings, we hypothesized that vegf is involved in the mechanisms underlying the cochlear protection against noise trauma that results from local ep <dig> agonist application. we thus examined the expression of ep <dig> in the cochlea, and the effects of local ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonist application on the modulation of vegf in the inner ear. the current study demonstrated an increase in the levels of vegf proteins and messenger rnas  following local ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonist application according to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , immunohistochemistry, and the real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . we also demonstrated the expression of vegf receptor- <dig>  or fms-related tyrosine kinase- <dig> , and vegf receptor- <dig>  or fetal liver kinase- <dig> , which mediate the physiological actions of vegf in the cochlea  <cit> .

RESULTS
ep <dig> expression in cochleae
our previous study demonstrated the localization of ep <dig> in the mouse cochlea  <cit> ; however, ep <dig> expression in the mouse cochlea has not been determined. we thus performed an immunohistochemical analysis of ep <dig> using normal mouse cochlear specimens in the current study. immunostaining revealed that the ep <dig> expression occurred in the stria vascularis, spiral ligament, spiral ganglion neurons, supporting cells, and hair cells . negative controls using a specific blocking peptide showed no immunoreactivity . these findings confirmed that ep <dig> expression was present in the cochlear cells, similar to ep <dig>  <cit> .

vegf increase due to ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists
to examine the changes in the expression of vegf proteins and vegf mrnas in the inner ear caused by ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists, we performed elisa and real-time qrt-pcr analyses of extracts from inner ear specimens following the local application of ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists or control substrates. elisa analyses revealed significant increases in vegf protein levels following ep <dig> agonist application at concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml . no significant increase of vegf protein levels was found in samples treated with  <dig> mg/ml ep <dig> agonist. the maximum vegf protein increase was found at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml. local application of an ep <dig> agonist also caused a significant increase of vegf protein levels in the inner ear. specimens treated with  <dig>  or  <dig>  mg/ml ep <dig> exhibited significantly higher vegf protein levels than those treated with  <dig>  or  <dig> % dimethyl sulfoxide  . no significant increase of vegf protein levels was identified in samples treated with  <dig> mg/ml ep <dig> agonist in comparison with those treated with 1% dmso. the ep <dig> agonist caused a maximum vegf protein increase at a concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml.

real-time qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated a significant increase of vegf mrna levels following the local application of the ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists. the relative vegf expression levels in the samples treated with  <dig>  or  <dig>  mg/ml ep <dig> agonist were significantly higher  than those in the control samples treated with saline . there was no significant difference in the relative vegf expression levels between the samples treated with  <dig> mg/ml ep <dig> agonist and the control samples, similar to the vegf protein levels. the relative vegf expression levels in the samples treated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml ep <dig> agonist were significantly higher  than those in the control samples treated with dmso . the samples treated with  <dig> mg/ml ep <dig> agonist exhibited no significant increase of vegf mrna levels in comparison with the control samples treated with dmso, similar to the vegf protein levels. the maximum increases in vegf mrna levels were observed after treatment with  <dig>  mg/ml ep <dig> and  <dig>  mg/ml ep <dig>  similar to the vegf protein levels. these results demonstrated that the ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists stimulated vegf production in the inner ear.

vegf expression in cochleae
our previous study  <cit>  and immunostaining for ep <dig> in the present study demonstrated the presence of ep <dig> and ep <dig> in various types of cochlear cells. elisa and real-time qrt-pcr analyses revealed vegf induction in inner ears by local ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist application. we then examined what type cochlear cells were responsible for vegf increase in the cochlea in response to local application of ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonists. we thus performed immunostaining for vegf in cochlear specimens treated with ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist and in untreated cochlear specimens. the untreated cochlear specimens showed little or no staining for vegf in the spiral ganglion neurons , supporting cells, hair cells, spiral ligament, and stria vascularis . in the control specimens treated with saline or dmso, vegf immunoreactivity was weakly detectable in some of the spiral ganglion neurons . by contrast, intense immunoreactivity for vegf was observed in the spiral ganglion neurons of the specimens treated with ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists . the other ep2-positive and ep4-positive regions of the cochlea, including the supporting cells, hair cells, spiral ligament, and stria vascularis, showed little or no immunoreactivity for vegf under all of the experimental conditions, and no changes in vegf immunoreactivity were observed. these findings indicate that the spiral ganglion neurons are responsible for the increase in vegf expression in the cochlea that results from the local application of an ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist.

vegfr expression in cochleae
to examine the target cells of vegf in the cochlea, we performed immunostaining for vegfrs, flt- <dig> and flk- <dig>  using non-treated cochlear specimens. flt- <dig> expression was detected in the supporting cells, hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons, and spiral ligament fibrocytes . flk- <dig> expression was identified in the supporting cells, hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons, spiral ligament fibrocytes, and stria vascularis marginal cells . these findings suggest that vegf generated in the spiral ganglion neurons in response to an ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist acts on cells expressing flt- <dig> and/or flk- <dig> in the cochlea in a paracrine or autocrine fashion.

discussion
recently, the prostaglandin e receptor subtypes ep <dig>  ep <dig>  ep <dig> and ep <dig> were cloned, and their specific agonists were purified  <cit> . ep <dig> and ep <dig> are coupled to g-protein stimulation and mediate increases in camp, while the activation of ep <dig> leads to a decrease of camp levels. we thus hypothesized that selective agonists for ep <dig> and ep <dig> might be more effective than pge <dig> for the treatment of snhl. in a previous study, we demonstrated the expression of ep <dig> in the cochlea, and the attenuation of noise-induced damage as a result of local ep <dig> agonist administration  <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of ep <dig> against on cochlear damage have not previously been investigated. in the present study, we highlighted vegf induction via ep <dig> or ep <dig> activation. the present study therefore examined the effects of ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonists on the modulation of inner ear vegf levels.

we initially confirmed that ep <dig> expression occurred in the cochlea and showed a similar pattern to ep <dig> expression  <cit> . elisa and real-time qrt-pcr analyses demonstrated an increase of vegf protein and mrna levels in the inner ear after local ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonist application, indicating that the stimulation of ep <dig> and/or ep <dig> activates vegf production in the inner ear. immunostaining for vegf showed that the strongest response to ep <dig> or ep <dig> stimulation occurred in the spiral ganglion neurons, suggesting that they are responsible for increasing the vegf levels in the inner ear. in addition, expression of the vegfrs flt- <dig> and flk- <dig> was identified in the sensory epithelial cells, spiral ganglion neurons, spiral ligament fibrocytes, and stria vascularis marginal cells, which was consistent with previous findings  <cit> . these results indicate that ep <dig> and ep <dig> are involved in the mechanisms underlying the autocrine and paracrine functions of vegf in the inner ear. for mechanisms of vegf induction via ep <dig> or ep <dig> activation, recent studies have indicated involvement of camp- and pka-dependent mechanisms via sp- <dig> transcription factor binding sites on the vegf promoter  <cit> . however, further studies are needed to determine signaling cascades for vegf induction via ep <dig> and ep <dig> in the inner ear.

vegf was initially identified as a mitogen for endothelial cells, which promotes angiogenesis and vascular permeability. numerous studies have demonstrated that vegf plays crucial roles in the development and protection of neuronal cells  <cit> . vegf and its receptors are also present in the cochlea, and have been shown to play significant roles in the maintenance of cochlear homeostasis  <cit> . the present findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of vegf expression in the cochlea, which is mediated by ep <dig> and ep <dig>  past work has demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> induces vegf upregulation in the cochlea, which is involved in the cochlear pericyte responses to noise trauma  <cit> . in the central nervous system, vegf synthesized by neurons was reported to promote survival and angiogenesis, as well as autocrine and paracrine neuronal survival  <cit> . the present results demonstrated spiral ganglion neuron responses to ep <dig> and ep <dig> stimulation, and the expression of both flt- <dig> and flk- <dig> in various cochlear components including the sensory epithelium, spiral ganglion, and stria vascularis. flk- <dig> appears to mediate almost all of the known cellular responses to vegf  <cit> , suggesting that flk- <dig> also plays an essential role in vegf function in the cochlea. however, an actual answer for this awaits further investigations. consequently, present findings indicate that vegf has autocrine and paracrine effects on neuronal and endothelial cells in the cochlea as well as in the central nervous system, and that ep <dig> and ep <dig> are involved in autocrine and paracrine functions of vegf in the cochlea.

hypoxic preconditioning is known to have protective effects on neurons  <cit> . recently, vegf was reported to be involved in the protective effect of neuronal preconditioning against ischemic injury  <cit> . protection against noise exposure by cochlear preconditioning has also been documented  <cit> . vegf upregulation in the cochlea is induced not only by intense noise exposure  <cit>  but also by moderate noise exposure  <cit> . these findings suggest that vegf is also involved in the mechanisms underlying protection against noise exposure by cochlear preconditioning. our previous study demonstrated that pretreatment with an ep <dig> agonist led to almost complete protection of the cochleae against noise trauma  <cit> . in addition, our present findings demonstrate the involvement of ep <dig> and ep <dig> in the regulation of vegf synthesis in the inner ear. ep2-mediated and ep4-mediated vegf synthesis in the cochlea could therefore be associated with protection against noise by cochlear preconditioning. however, distinct roles of vegf in cochlear protection by local application of ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonists have not been elucidated. further studies are required to determine whether vegf antagonists suppress protective effects of ep <dig> or ep <dig> agonists for cochleae.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrated that local ep <dig> and ep <dig> agonist treatment induces vegf synthesis in the inner ear, especially in the spiral ganglion neurons. the expression of vegfrs was detected in the cochlear sensory epithelium, spiral ganglion, spiral ligament, and stria vascularis. these findings indicate the involvement of ep <dig> and ep <dig> in the autocrine and paracrine functions of vegf in the cochlea.
