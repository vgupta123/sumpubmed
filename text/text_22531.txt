BACKGROUND
fgf <dig> is a potent regulator of glucose homeostasis  <cit> . it was originally identified as a hormone that stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes  <cit> . fgf <dig> is induced and secreted from the liver upon fasting and acts on adipose tissues to induce metabolic adaptation to fasting <cit> . specifically, fgf <dig> stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes, a process which releases fatty acids into the bloodstream; when they reach the liver, these fatty acids are converted to ketones <cit> . fgf <dig> is free of the proliferative and tumorigenic effects  <cit>  that are documented for other members of the fgf family  <cit> . systemic administration of fgf <dig> reduced plasma glucose, fructosamine, triglycerides, insulin, and glucagon in diabetic rhesus monkeys <cit> . fgf <dig> administration led to significant improvements in lipoprotein profiles, by lowering low-density cholesterol and by raising high-density cholesterol, as well as causing weight loss in the animals  <cit> .

in recent years, fgf <dig> has been described as potential new drug candidate to combat metabolic diseases  <cit> . however, producing fgf <dig> by traditional techniques, such as plasmid recombination in e. coli, yields disappointing results. kharitonenkov's experiment has shown that recombinant fgf <dig>  accumulated and formed inclusion bodies in transformed e. coli  <cit> . our previous experiments also showed that rfgf <dig> without fusion expression more easily formed inclusion bodies, and it was difficult to produce bioactive protein , because the inclusion bodies need to be denatured, annealed, and purified through many chromatography columns.

sumo  proteins are covalently attached to and removed from specific protein substrates in eukaryotic cells <cit> . sumoylation as a reversible post-translational modification process has been shown to be involved in many cellular processes including nuclear-cytosolic transport, apoptosis, protein activation, protein stability, stress response, and cell cycle progression <cit> . in recent years, sumo has become an effective biotechnological tool as a fusion system to enhance soluble expression of proteins and decrease proteolytic degradation, which could not be achieved by traditional expression systems <cit> . sumo is then post-translationally enzymatically cleaved from the desired protein by sumo c-terminal hydrolases-isopeptidases  <cit> . proteins such as, sars virus protein <cit> , mmp <dig> <cit> , egf <cit> , metallothionein <cit> , and kgf <dig> <cit>  have been successfully expressed and purified using this fusion strategy.

recently, ren  <cit>  expressed fgf <dig> using a commercial vector containing a sumo tag and showed that sumo promotes the soluble expression of fgf <dig> in e. coli. however, no higher level of purity was attained using ni-nta affility purification alone. thus, we cloned sumo fragment and constructed an expression plasmid containing sumo and human fgf <dig>  the results show that this novel method of protein expression can promote significantly higher rfgf <dig> levels, making it easier to be dissolved in the soluble fraction for purification and producing native n-terminal recombinant protein with its bioactivity preserved.

RESULTS
synthesis of the fusion gene and construction of pet-sumo-fgf <dig> expression vector
to synthesize the fusion gene composed of sumo and fgf <dig>  fourteen special primers were designed . the synthesis strategy is described in the figure  <dig> and the detailed procedure is included in materials and methods. the pcr products of sumo-fgf <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the final pcr product was digested with two restriction enzymes  and cloned into the expression vector pet-20b. the sequence of the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by automated dna sequencing. the results show that the sequence of the sumo-fgf <dig>  is in conformity with the prior sequence. the sequence of the sumo-fgf <dig> has been submitted the genbank database .

expression and purification of sumo-fgf21
recombinants were inoculated in fresh luria-bertani  medium, and incubated in a shaking incubator at 37°c until the od <dig> was  <dig>  to  <dig> . isopropyl -d-thiogalactoside  was then added to a final concentration of  <dig> mm for the induction of expression. recombinant bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. the supernatants and pellets were collected and subjected to 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis. the results show that the molecular weight of the expression product is  <dig> kda, which corresponds to the predicted size of sumo-fgf <dig>  the target protein is more than 30% of total cellular protein and the soluble fraction reaches  <dig> % of the total expressed recombinant proteins .

according to the isoelectric point of fusion protein, deae sepharose ff was chosen for the purification of sumo-fgf <dig>  sds-page results show that most of the host proteins are removed from sumo-fgf <dig> after being purified with a deae sepharose ff column. furthermore, a ni-nta affinity column was chosen for further purification. proteins without  <dig> × his tags were removed from the ni-nta resin using pbs containing  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm imidazole; sumo-fgf <dig> was eluted using pbs containing  <dig> mm imidazole. sds-page analysis of samples taken from this step showed that the purity of sumo-fgf <dig> reached  <dig> % .

in recent years, there have been many reports concerning sumo as an expression fusion tag. the expression level of the fusion protein containing metallothionein, gst and sumo was  <dig> % of the total supernatant proteins from the organism  <cit> . our data show that sumo-fgf <dig> concentration is over 25% of all soluble proteins. expression efficiency may be affected by molecular weight, amino acid constitution, and the function of proteins, etc. as far as protein isolation, we performed two-step purifications, which resulted in the purity of sumo-fgf <dig> reaching  <dig> %. the results show that two-step purification is helpful for improving the purity of rfgf <dig>  which was more successful than one step ni-nta purification  <cit> , as well as inclusion body purification  <cit> .

cleavage of the sumo domain from sumo-fgf <dig> protein and further purification of rfgf21
when the target protein was fused directly to the c-terminus of sumo, cleavage by sumo protease  <dig> resulted in the release of the target protein with the desired n-terminal amino acid sequence <cit> . in our studies, the pre-purified fusion protein was diluted and cleaved by sumo protease. the lysate was purified by ni-nta resin. sumo and sumo protease containing his tags that were affiliated by ni-nta resin, but rfgf <dig> was eluted out of the ni-nta column. the results showed that rfgf <dig> was highly purified by sds-page  and could react with the human fgf <dig> polyclonal antibody by western blot . hplc analysis of the target protein showed a major peak of rfgf <dig>  with a retention time of  <dig>  min; the purity exceeded 96% .

next, we tested endotoxin levels from three different batches of purified rfgf <dig>  and the results were less than  <dig>  eu/ml, which is considered acceptable compared to commercially available proteins. these levels were also in accordance with the standard of injection biologics listed in the chinese pharmacopeia of  <dig>  it also suggests that the purity of rfgf <dig> by this method can meet the requirements of pharmaceutical research in vivo.

mass spectrometric and n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis
in order to confirm the authenticity of rfgf <dig>  the target protein was subjected to maldi-tof mass spectroscopy analysis and n-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis. the molecular weight of rfgf <dig> analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectroscopy was  <dig>  kda, which was very close to  <dig>  kda, theoretical molecular weight of fgf <dig>  moreover, according to the sequencing result, the first five amino acids of our rfgf <dig> n-terminus were h-p-i-p-d, which was in conformity with native fgf <dig> 

in vivo bioactivity of rfgf21
the construction of diabetic rat models is described in materials and methods. we tested the effects of rfgf <dig> on diabetic rats. diabetic rats were treated daily for two weeks with high, medium, and low dosages of rfgf <dig> . all treatments produced significant changes when compared with the control animals. the statistical results are described using column graph . we can see that the changes in plasma glucose levels all show significant differences compared to controls after injecting three doses of rfgf <dig>  the results also show that rfgf <dig> acts in a dose-dependent manner to reduce plasma glucose in diabetic rats. high doses of rfgf <dig> result in better effects than the other two doses. the high dose lowers circulating glucose from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol/l. compared to rfgf <dig>  insulin displayed more significant effects in decreasing plasma glucose with cp <  <dig> , which is considered a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment. the different effects might be due to different mechanism in decreasing plasma glucose between insulin and fgf <dig>  in contrast to insulin, which is known to function via glut <dig> translocation, fgf- <dig> primarily act through up-regulation of cellular glut <dig> <cit> .

many other experiments have also documented that fgf <dig> could promote the glucose uptake in adipocytes  <cit>  and 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> , as well as reduce plasma glucose and triglyceride in animal models of type  <dig> diabetes, such as mouse and monkey  <cit> . however, there were some differences in rfgf21-mediated reductions in blood glucose levels attributable to different animal genotypes and treatment. in ob/ob mice, doses of  <dig> and  <dig> μg/kg/d of fgf- <dig> significantly lowered blood glucose compared with vehicle treatment after  <dig> days of administration <cit> . after  <dig> days of drug administration, fgf <dig> treatment not only reduces fasting blood glucose, but also improves insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice  <cit> . notably,  <dig> μg/kg dose of rfgf- <dig> lowered mean fasting plasma glucose from the overtly diabetic level to near normal when administered for  <dig> weeks  <cit> . in our studies, rfgf <dig> at doses of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> μg/kg/d all decreased glucose levels in diabetic mice. administration of fgf <dig> resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in circulating levels of glucose.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that, when fused with sumo, soluble expression of rfgf <dig> increased in e. coli; this form is also conveniently isolated rfgf <dig> than previously described forms. as a novel molecular chaperon domain, sumo increases the yield of recombinant protein and makes it easier to dissolve in the soluble fraction for protein purification. this strategy can be used as a source of reference for the expression and purification of other proteins.
