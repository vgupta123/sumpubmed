BACKGROUND
gene expression analysis is increasingly important in many fields of biological research. understanding patterns of expressed genes is crucial to provide insights into complex regulatory networks and will lead to the identification of genes relevant to new biological processes  <cit> .

reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  is a robust method to study gene expression changes  <cit> . the main advantages of qpcr when compared to other experimental techniques used to evaluate gene expression levels, such as northern blot hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction , are its higher sensitivity, specificity, and broad quantification range of up to seven orders of magnitude  <cit> . therefore, qpcr analysis has become the most common method for validating the whole-genome microarray data or a smaller set of genes and molecular diagnostics  <cit> . although being extremely powerful technique, qpcr suffers from certain pitfalls, noteworthy the use of unreliable reference genes for the normalization step  <cit> . normalization is necessary for the correction of non-specific variations, such as inaccurate quantification of rna and problems in the quality of rna that can trigger variable reverse transcription and pcr reactions. a number of strategies have been proposed to normalize qpcr data but normalization remains one of the most important challenges concerning this technique  <cit> .

the expression of reference genes used for normalization in qpcr analysis should remain constant between the cells of different tissues and under different experimental conditions; otherwise, it can lead to erroneous results. recent reports have demonstrated that some of the most well-known and frequently used reference genes are inappropriate for normalization in qpcr analysis due to expression variability  <cit> . the importance of reference genes for plant qpcr analysis has been recently emphasized even though the identification of these genes is quite laborious  <cit> . microarray datasets can also be a rich source of information for selecting qpcr reference genes  <cit> , but unfortunately, this tool is still not available for most of plant species, including cotton.

the classical housekeeping genes involved in basic cellular processes such as  <dig> s rrna, ubiquitin, actin, β-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been recurrently used as internal controls for gene expression analysis in plant as they are supposed to have a uniform expression all samples and experimental conditions tested. however, several reports demonstrated that the transcript levels of these genes also vary considerably under different experimental conditions and are consequently unsuitable for gene expression studies  <cit> . statistical algorithms such as genorm  <cit> , normfinder  <cit>  and bestkeeper  <cit>  have been developed for the evaluation of best suited reference gene for normalization of qpcr data in a given set of biological samples. recognizing the importance of reference genes in normalization of rt-qpcr data, various housekeeping genes have been evaluated for stable expression under specific conditions in various organisms. many works have been carried on animal and human health  <cit>  field that describe the identification of multiple reference genes for normalisation of qpcr data, but similar reports are scarce in plant research  <cit> . czechowski et al.  employed a new strategy for the identification of reference genes in arabidopsis thaliana. based on the microarray data of affymetrix ath <dig>  several new reference genes were revealed in arabidopsis  <cit> . some of these genes have no previous information about function in arabidopsis or any other organism. the list of new arabidopsis reference genes revealed by czechowski and collaborators was successfully employed to search reference genes in unrelated species such as vitis vinifera by sequence homology  <cit> . recently, our group was also successful in providing new reference genes for qpcr in coffea arabica and brachiaria brizantia using the same strategy employed in v. vinifera  <cit> .

cotton  is the world's most important source of natural fiber and also an important source of edible oil  <cit> . because of its unique reproductive developmental aspects and speciation history, g. hirsutum has attracted considerable scientific interest, not only among plant breeders and agricultural scientists, but also among taxonomists, developmental geneticists, and evolutionary biologists  <cit> . in spite of this, qpcr analyses in cotton are still hampered by the use of inappropriate references genes.

in this study, we report the validation of housekeeping genes to identify the most suitable internal control gene for normalization of qpcr data obtained in different plant organs and floral verticils and also during flower and fruit development. in addition, to illustrate the usefulness of the new reference genes, we provided a detailed expression analysis of two mads-box transcription factors in cotton, putative homologues of arabidopsis agamous and sepallata <dig> genes.

methods
plant material
experiments were performed using three-month old gossypim hirsutum plants variety "brs cedro". plants were grown under controlled temperature  and natural photoperiod in embrapa cenargem in brasília . the organs used from cotton plants were flower buds, fruits, leaves, stems, branches, roots and floral meristem. we also included seven stages of flower development  and four stages of fruit development  <cit> . the stages of flower and fruit and the respective major events of development are summarized in additional file  <dig>  in addition, floral organs  from  <dig> mm flower buds were dissected and harvested. the material was harvested from, at least, five different cotton plants to obtain one pool. the procedure was repeated with five distinct plants in order to obtain a second pool, the biological replicate. all samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c until needed for rna extraction.

total rna isolation and cdna synthesis
frozen samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. the total rna extractions were performed from  <dig> mg of each macerate plant tissue in liquid nitrogen, using invisorb spin plant rna mini kit  according to the protocol of the manufacturer. two other methods of rna extraction were evaluated , but the yields and dna purity in our hands were unsatisfactory . rna concentration and purity were determined using a nanodroptm spectrophotometer nd- <dig> , and the integrity of rna was also assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. the presence of contaminant dna in the rna samples was verified by pcr using primers spanning two exon and gel electrophoresis analysis. no fragments of genomic dna were identified in all samples tested in this work . the presence of spurious product of amplification caused by genomic dna was also continuously checked by the verification of rt-qpcr dissociation profile. both tests showed that the invisorb spin plant rna mini kit efficiently removed contaminant dna from the rna samples. cdnas were synthesized by adding  <dig> μm of oligo primer and  <dig> mm of each deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate  to  <dig> μg of total rna. this mixture was incubated at 65°c for five minutes, and briefly chilled on ice. first strand buffer,  <dig> mm of dithiothreitol  and  <dig> units of superscript iii  were added to the prior mixture and the total volume  was incubated at 50°c for  <dig> h following manufacturer's instructions. inactivation of the reverse transcriptase was done by incubating the mixture at 70°c for  <dig> min and the cdna solution was stored at -20°c.

real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
eight of the nine putative cotton reference genes evaluated in this work, ghact <dig> , ghef1α <dig> , ghfbx <dig> , ghpp2a <dig> , ghmza , ghptb , ghgapc <dig> , ghβtub <dig> , were selected according to their similarity to reference genes identified in arabidopsis   <cit> . the sequences of possible g. hirsutum homologues were identified through a blastn against the database of the green plant gb tair . only sequences that showed similarity higher than 1e- <dig>  were considered as putative homologous to the arabidopsis genes and were selected for primer design. we also selected the gene encoding the poly-ubiquitin, ghubq <dig>  commonly used in cotton for experiments of northern blots and rt-qpcrs  <cit>  . primers were designed with primer  <dig> software  <cit>  using as criterion amplified products from  <dig> to  <dig> bp with a tm of  <dig> ± 1°c . both candidate reference and mads-box genes were amplified from cdna. melting curve and gel electrophoresis analysis of the amplification products confirmed that the primers amplified only a single product with expected size . primer sets efficiencies were estimated for each experimental set by miner software  <cit> , and the values were used in all subsequent analysis . miner software pinpoints the starting and ending points of pcr exponential phase from raw fluorescence data, and estimates primer set amplification efficiencies through a nonlinear regression algorithm without the need of a standard curve.

*all cotton sequences were named according the most similar ortholog locus   of the coding sequence of the ortholog locus in a. thaliana. ***cotton gene previously used as reference gene in qpcr  <cit> . na - not applicable.

the values of efficiency of primers were generated for each experimental situation .

polymerase chain reactions were carried out in an optical 96-well plate with a chromo <dig> real time pcr detector  sequence detection system, using sybr®green to monitor dsdna synthesis. reaction mixtures contained  <dig> μl of diluted cdna ,  <dig>  μm of each primer,  <dig> μm of each dntp, 1× pcr buffer ,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μl of sybr®green i  water diluted , and  <dig>  units of platinum taq dna polymerase , in a total volume of  <dig> μl. reaction mixtures were incubated for five minutes at 94°c, followed by  <dig> amplification cycles of  <dig> s at 94°c,  <dig> s at 60°c and  <dig> s at 72°c. pcr efficiencies and optimal quantification cycle threshold . in order to search for mads-box sequences, a mads-box consensus sequence was used. this consensus was generated by the cobbler program  from all identified mads-box amino acid sequences "mgrkkieikrienktnrqvtfskrrnglfkkahelsvlcdaev alivfspsgrlyeyannni"  <cit> . searches were conducted using the tblastn algorithm with the blosum <dig> scoring matrix  <cit> . all sequences that exhibit a significant alignment  with the consensus were retrieved from unigene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/ugorg.cgi?taxid= <dig> in the cotton genome database http://cottondb.org/cdbhome.html. all retrieved sequences were then re-inspected for occurrence of mads conserved motif using the interproscan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interproscan/ and prodom http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/form.php programs. multiple alignments with complete sequences or domains were conducted using the clustalw program using default parameters and then manually revised  <cit> . phylogenetic trees were constructed using pairwise distance matrices for neighbor-joining method  <cit>  and p-distance on the mega  <dig>  program  <cit> . assessment of node confidence was done by means of  <dig>  bootstrap replicates.

analysis of gene expression stability
expression levels of the nine housekeeping genes in all the sample pools were determined by the number of cycles  needed for the amplification related fluorescence to reach a specific threshold level of detection. cq values were converted in qbase software v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  into non-normalized relative quantities, corrected by pcr efficiency, using the formula q = eΔcq where e is the efficiency of the gene amplification and Δcq is the sample with the lowest expression in the data set minus the cq value of the sample in question. these quantities were imported into genorm v <dig>   <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  analysis tools, which were used as described in their manuals. data of biological replicates were analyzed separately in both programs.

RESULTS
in order to compare the expression levels of target genes in different tissues at the same time, it is crucial to normalize all the samples by the same set of reference genes. for the evaluation of potential reference, a well known housekeeping gene, poly-ubiquitin , was included in the qpcr experiments  <cit> . we selected eight new candidates to housekeeping genes  in g. hirsutum. these genes are putative homologues of eight arabidopsis genes included in the list of  <dig> best reference genes for qpcr analysis   <cit> . for the selection of the putative cotton housekeeping genes, we searched in the cotton db for homologues to the arabidopsis referenced genes, only eight candidates that showed very high similarities  were included in the final list. the eight genes found in the cotton databanks belong to different functional classes based on arabidopsis sequence information, which reduce the chances of co-regulated expression occurrence among these genes . the gene name, accession number, a. thaliana homologue locus, a. thaliana annotation, similarity end identity, gene size, and primer sequence, are provided in table  <dig>  the nine cotton candidate reference genes were evaluated for gene expression stability by qpcr in a set of  <dig> cotton samples grouped into five different experimental sets. the first experimental set was composed of plant organs: leaves, stem, branch, root, flower buds  and fruits . the second set included floral meristem and size selected flower buds, based on their diameter of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mm. the third experimental set was composed of the floral verticils: sepal, petal, stamen, carpel and pedicel. the fourth experimental set consists of four stages of fruit development based on it diameter:  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  and larger than  <dig> mm . finally, in the fifth set, we included all the tissues samples used in this study .

total rna was isolated from different tissue samples and reverse transcribed. the rna quality for all samples was checked by gel eletrophoresis analisys and spectrophotometric assays . within a biological replicate, for a tissue sample, the same cdna pool was used for qpcr analysis of each of the nine genes using gene-specific primers. qpcrs were performed in triplicate for each of the  <dig> cdna pools along with a no template control in parallel for each gene. the melting-curve analysis performed by the pcr machine after  <dig> cycles of amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis showed that all the  <dig> primer pairs amplified a single pcr product of desired size from various cdna . primer efficiencies for all primer combinations were higher than  <dig>   in all experimental sets. although, two primers pairs presented efficiencies below 90% in four samples: ghgapc <dig> in flower buds and floral and plant organs and ghpp2a <dig> in floral organs . the mean cq value  in a tissue sample for each gene is shown in table  <dig>  cq values were in the range of  <dig>  and  <dig> . ghact <dig>  ghubq <dig> and ghef1α <dig> are the top three most expressed genes in all sets followed by ghmza, ghβtub <dig>  ghpp2a <dig> and ghptb. ghfbx <dig> and ghgapc <dig> genes present the lowest expression levels in all samples.

we used genorm v <dig>  software, to analyze the expression stability of the tested genes in all samples, and ranked them accordingly to gene stability measure . the m value is obtained by the use of relative expression values for each cdna sample as input for the genorm algorithm based on the geometric averaging of multiple control genes and mean pairwise variation of a gene from all other control genes in a given set of samples. therefore, genes with the lowest m values have the most stable expression. the results obtained with genorm algorithm are presented in the figure  <dig> and summarized in table  <dig>  the genorm algorithm also determines the pairwise variation vn/n +  <dig>  which measures the effect of adding further reference genes on the normalisation factor . it is advisable to add additional reference genes to the normalisation factor until the added gene has no significant effect. vandesompele et al.  used  <dig>  as a cut-off value, below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene is not required. pairwise variation analysis  showed that the ideal number of reference genes may be different for distinct set of samples. for instance, for the normalization of the floral organ set, only two genes are necessary. on the other hand, five genes are required for the normalization of the plant organ set. when evaluating all the pairwise variation, the least stable housekeeping gene was ghgapc <dig> followed by ghβtub <dig> since they significantly increased the pairwise variation during the whole assay by increasing the v value as shown in figure  <dig>  however, vandesompele and collaborators recommend the use of at least three reference genes whenever this result obtained in our analysis is observed  <cit> .

stability values are listed from the most stable genes to the least stable.

in addition, to the analysis by genorm we also evaluated the data with normfinder algorithm . differentially to genorm, normfinder takes into account intra- and intergroup variations for normalization factor  calculations. when the outcome of genorm and normfinder are compared few, but relevant, differences are observed . these discrepancies between the results are expected since the genorm and normfinder are based on distinct statistical algorithms.

to assess the validity of the procedure for the selection of control genes detailed above, the relative expression level of two cotton genes that belong to mads-box family were inspected. after the search in cotton db using the mads-box consensus sequence,  <dig> ests were found with high similarity to mikc mads box family  . the reduced number of cotton mikc type genes is expected since the ests sequencing efforts in cotton are very limited when compared to other species such as arabidopsis and rice. in spite of the low number of mads-box genes, the phylogenetic analysis identified good candidates to homologous genes of arabidopsis agamous  and sepallata <dig>  . the homologue of ag, was previously characterized by rt-pcr and named ghmads <dig>  <cit> . rt-pcr analysis suggests that ghmads <dig> expression is restricted to stamens and carpels. ectopic expression in nicotiana tabacum l. indicates that it is the cotton orthologous gene to ag  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana sep <dig> is expressed in the three inner whorls of organs throughout flower development, but there is no information of the putative homologue of cotton , identified by our phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . the expression of ghmads <dig> and ghsep-like <dig> was estimated in different plant organs, during flower development and in the floral organs of  <dig> mm flower buds. the qpcr analysis employed the control genes recommended by normfinder program for the normalization of gene expression. the analysis revealed that g. hirsutum ghmads <dig> and ghsep-like <dig> genes very similar expression profiles of ag and sep <dig> genes from arabidopsis . however, we also observed unexpected expression patterns: ghsep-like <dig> is expressed in cotton fruits and the ghmads <dig> in pedicels of  <dig> mm flower buds.

discussion
the qpcr is broadly accepted as the method of choice for accurate and sensitive quantification of gene transcript levels, even for those genes whose transcript levels are low. for valid qpcr analysis, accurate normalization of gene expression against an appropriate internal control is required. the ideal control gene should have similar expression regardless of experimental conditions, including different cell types, developmental stages, and/or sample treatment. however, no one gene has a stable expression under every experimental condition, as numerous studies reported that expression of housekeeping genes can also vary considerably with experimental conditions. consequently, normalization of gene expression with a single reference gene can trigger erroneous data and, consequently, misinterpretation of experiment results. therefore, it is necessary to validate the expression stability of a control gene under specific experimental conditions prior to its use in qpcr normalization.

normalisation with multiple reference genes is becoming the golden standard, but reports that identify such genes in plant research are limited  <cit> , even though algorithms are available to test the expression stability of candidates  <cit>  and a number of candidate reference genes for arabidopsis have been proposed  <cit> . to obtain a solid basis for normalization of our gene expression data when studying the flower development in cotton, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes, including one traditional "housekeeping" gene in five different experimental sets. candidate genes were selected according to the level of dna sequence similarity to genes previously identified as reference genes in arabidopsis and cotton. this strategy has been successful in finding good reference genes in other species such as grape  <cit>  and it was already employed by our group in coffee and b. brizantha  <cit> . another strategy used to identify bona fide qpcr reference genes is to check housekeeping genes previously used in northern and rt-pcr studies  <cit> . however, it has be shown that the expression of traditional reference genes may vary enormously depending on the test condition  <cit> . in cotton, tu and collaborators tested six putative constitutive genes , two of them  from previously published data  <cit> . in contrast to the present work, roots, floral stages and verticils samples were not included in the final set of samples  <cit> . the reference genes evaluation was performed using exclusively genorm and the value obtained for the pairwise variation with the best control genes was above the cut-off value of  <dig>  suggested by vandesompele et al.  <cit> . moreover, the expression in the fiber developmental series of the all six putative reference genes varied greatly, hampering their use for qpcr  <cit> .

we elected the normfinder as the preferential method for the selection of the best references genes since it considers intra- and inter-group variations for the normalization factor . however, genorm was also important to compose the final set of references genes for the experimental conditions tested in this work. our analysis has shown that each experimental condition tested demands a specific set of reference genes . this result emphasizes the importance of reference genes validation for each experimental condition, especially when samples belong to very different groups, e.g. different organs.

when plant organs and all samples were tested, ghubq <dig> and ghpp2a <dig> were considered the most appropriate reference genes. ghubq <dig> and ghpp2a <dig> should avoid error transferences since normfinder chose them as the best combination of genes. normfinder chose ghact <dig> and ghubq <dig> as the best combination of two genes in flower buds. both programs ranked ghact <dig> as the most stable gene, conferring higher robustness to the nf. our analyses of different floral organs revealed that ghact <dig> and ghfbx <dig> are the most appropriated genes for qpcr normalization, since they represent the best combination of genes considered by normfinder to improve nf. ghfbx <dig> was ranked by both algorithms as the most stable gene in the floral organs set. finally, fruit development ghmza was considered as the most stable gene in both the normfinder and genorm programs, and normfinder chose ghmza and ghptb as the best combination of genes.

the ghact <dig>  ghef1α <dig>  ghfbx <dig>  ghpp2a <dig>  ghmza, ghptb, ghgapc <dig>  ghβtub genes were identified as novel reference genes in a. thaliana through microarray experiments and were validated by qpcr  <cit> . among them, ghgapc <dig> gave poor results in our analysis in cotton. ghubq <dig>  a traditional reference gene in cotton  <cit>  was well evaluated by normfinder ranking in the best combination in three of the five experimental sets. although, evaluations of a traditional reference genes by the same procedures used in this work not always give support to their frequent use. for instance, ubq <dig> gene shows highly stable expression in arabidopsis  <cit>  whereas its putative homologue has been shown unsuitable for normalization of different tissues at different developmental stages in rice and soybean  <cit> .

other commonly used housekeeping gene, ghβtub, displayed inappropriate expression variability limiting its use as internal control in cotton. a similar result was also observed for the β-tubulin of b. brizantha when male and female reproductive tissues, spikelets, roots and leaves were evaluated  <cit> . on the other hand, β-tub is one of most stably expressed genes in poplar  tissue samples among the  <dig> reference genes tested  <cit> . gapdh, another traditional reference gene, was considered the most appropriate reference gene when coffee leaves drought-stressed vs. control plants and different coffee cultivar leaves were analyzed  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the housekeeping genes are regulated differently in different plant species and may exhibit differential expression patterns. this may partly be explained by the fact that housekeeping genes are not only implicated in the basal cell metabolism but also may participate in other cellular functions  <cit> .

the programs employed to evaluate reference genes in our study  use the same input data, i.e. non-normalized relative quantities, and cqs need to be transformed considering primer pair efficiencies. in our experience, it is crucial to evaluate primer pair efficiencies for each sample tested since primer efficiency varies depend on the according to biological sample. the importance of this step can be well illustrated by the primer efficiency variation of ghgacp <dig> in flower buds compared to fruits .

the values of cq presented here should not be considered alone, but they may help in the selection of best combination of reference genes when there is previous data about target gene expression levels. similar expression levels of the reference and target genes are considered an important issue regarding qpcr normalization  <cit> . indeed, references genes with excessively high/low expression levels compared to target genes can trigger problems for data analysis  <cit> .

as suggested by remans and collaborators  <cit> , biological replicates were submitted to genorm and normfinder as independent samples. this procedure increased the credibility of the most suitable cotton reference genes because it takes into account possible variations in reference gene expression that are not due to different treatments, but intrinsic to the gene itself.

to illustrate the suitability of the reference genes revealed in the present study, two putative cotton homologues to ag and sep <dig>  had their expression profile evaluated in different plant organs, during flower development and in floral organs at flower buds of  <dig> mm . as it is observed to ag and sep <dig>  the ghmads <dig> and ghsep-like <dig> genes are highly expressed in flower buds, but ghsep-like <dig> also shows a high expression in fruits. ghmads <dig> also is expressed in higher levels after stage of  <dig> mm and throughout cotton flower development. the low expression of ghmads <dig> in floral meristem is expected as well a high expression level in stamen and carpels of  <dig> mm flower bud. the ag gene is expressed in few cells during the initial flower development to establish organ identity and is also important at later stages of stamens and carpels development  <cit> . the ghmads <dig> expression observed in pedicels may be the result of contamination of material derived from carpels. these two organs are merged, which hamper a perfect separation during flower bud dissection to collect the samples. our analysis of ghmads <dig> expression by rt-qpcr refined the information of the previous study adding accuracy, spatial and temporal information to the expression during floral development  <cit> . in addition, it revealed that this ghmads <dig> is also expressed in cotton fruits .

the high expression in fruits of ghsep-like <dig> contrast to the spatial and developmental expression pattern of sep <dig> in arabidopsis, former agl <dig>   <cit> . sep <dig> is expressed in all arabidopsis flower verticils throughout development but no transcripts are found in siliques. however, ppersep <dig>  a putative prunus persica homologue of sep <dig>  is expressed during fruit development  <cit> . in addition, ghmads <dig> and ghmads <dig>  genes from agamous subclass in cotton, are also expressed during fiber development  <cit> . taking together, these results suggest that besides flower identity sep <dig> and ag-like genes in cotton may be involved in an additional developmental process during fruit development.

CONCLUSIONS
this work constitutes the first in-depth study to validate the optimal control genes for the quantification of transcript levels in different cotton organs and during flower and fruit development. the use of the new cotton reference genes combined with size collected flower buds and floral organ dissection allowed a precise spatial and temporal characterization of two mads-box genes in cotton plants. in summary, the new cotton reference genes will enable more accurate and reliable normalization of qpcr results for gene expression studies in this important crop plant.
