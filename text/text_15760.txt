BACKGROUND
homocysteine  is a non-proteic sulfur-containing amino acid product of methionine metabolism. hyperhomocysteinemia is determined by genetic factors, such as deficiency in enzyme activities involved in homocysteine remethylation and transulphuration pathways, and/or reduced dietary intake of folate, vitamin b <dig> and vitamin b <dig>  <cit> . increased plasma hcy levels are a well known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and have also been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease, and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly  <cit> . moreover, perinatal exposure to hyperhomocysteinemia might disturb neurogenesis during brain development and growth, as well as hereditary severe hyperhomocysteinemia leads to a variety of neurological impairments in children  <cit> . however, the putative mechanisms of homocysteine-induced toxicity in the developing nervous system have poorly been elucidated.

hcy induces neurotoxicity in human and murine neuronal cells through several mechanisms, including over-stimulation of nmda receptors, oxidative stress and dna damage  <cit> . hcy is excitotoxic at least as glutamate and also enhances glutamate excitotoxicity  <cit> . moreover, while normal activation of nmda receptors can provoke both excitation and inhibition, hcy only elicited excitation in cerebellar neurons  <cit> .

recently, a novel mechanism for hcy neurotoxicity has recently been described. this involves the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity following copper binding by hcy  <cit> . also, previous studies demonstrated that high hcy levels cause an imbalance in the redox status homeostasis with generation of toxic reactive oxygen species   <cit> . the excess of ros production triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, finally leading to neurodegeneration  <cit> .

a growing body of evidence suggests that ros-induced cell damage results from or is accompanied by inflammatory processes. it has been shown that nf-κb activation plays a pivotal role in the up-regulation of many inflammatory genes, whose products are putatively involved in apoptosis  <cit> . however, the role of nf-κb in neuronal death is controversial, and the effects of nf-κb nuclear translocation in cell response still remain unclear. indeed, it has been reported that nf-κb activation in neurons is protective against degeneration, whereas in microglia promotes cell death  <cit> .

the present study was designed to investigate the role of pro-oxidant effects of hcy exposure in undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, neuro2a, and the possible involvement of nf-κb pathway in hcy-induced cell injury.

RESULTS
to evaluate hcy-induced cell redox status alterations, neuro2a cell cultures were exposed to different hcy doses , in the presence or absence of nac  and irfi  <dig> . hcy did not significantly affect ros levels in neuro2a cells when used in a concentration range of 10– <dig> μm. higher hcy concentrations, i.e. 250– <dig> μm, produced a two-three fold increase in ros production, respectively, in comparison to untreated cells. the incubation of cell cultures with hcy in the presence of either nac or irfi  <dig> was able to strongly counteract hcy effects on ros production . notably, a higher protective effect was displayed by irfi  <dig>  reducing hcy-evoked increases in ros levels by 35%, compared with a 20% reduction achieved in the presence of nac .

the mtt assay demonstrated that the treatment with 10– <dig> μm hcy did not significantly affect the number of viable cells compared with controls, while  <dig> μm hcy drastically reduced cell viability to less than 40% . notably, irfi  <dig> and nac were able to recover cell viability . the subsequent experiments were carried out using  <dig> μm hcy, in order to minimize alteration in cell homeostasis dependent on massive cell necrosis.

the possible occurrence of nf-κb activation, concomitantly with redox state alterations induced by hcy, was investigated by emsa. we demonstrated an increase in dna binding activity by heterodimer nf-κb complexes, mainly composed by p <dig> and p <dig> subunits, in nuclear extracts of hcy-treated neuroblastoma cells in comparison with untreated ones, where lower amounts of active nf-κb complexes were found . moreover, as expected, the incubation with sn <dig> significantly inhibited nf-κb nuclear translocation . notably, when neuro2a cells were incubated with hcy  in the presence of irfi  <dig> , a significant reduction of nf-κb levels was observed . these data suggest a direct relationship between hcy-induced oxidative stress and nf-κb activation.

in order to better evaluate hcy effects on cell damage in neuro2a cells, we examined the expression of known protein markers of apoptosis onset. the treatment with hcy  for  <dig> h significantly increased bax protein levels in comparison with control cells, whereas bcl- <dig> expression was not affected . interestingly, the incubation with hcy in the presence of sn <dig> reduced hcy-induced bax up-regulation while did not affect bcl- <dig> levels .

the treatment of neuro2a cells with hcy also caused the caspase- <dig> up-regulation , that was accompanied by a significant increase in caspase- <dig> activity compared with control cells .

the evaluation of caspase- <dig> activity was carried out based on measurements of specific cleavage of devd-pna as described in materials and methods. results are mean ± sem of six experiments. * p <  <dig>  and **p <  <dig>  significant differences in comparison to control cells.

interestingly, in hcy-exposed cells, the sn50-mediated specific nf-κb inhibition lowered high levels of caspase- <dig> protein  and enzyme activity . the addition of either irfi  <dig>  or nac  was also able to reduce hcy-induced increases in caspase- <dig> activity by 32% and 28% respectively .

to further evaluate the nf-κb involvement in hcy-evoked apoptosis in neuro2a cells, hcy effects on the expression of p <dig> were assessed in the presence or absence of sn <dig>  indeed, hcy treatment induced p <dig> up-regulation, that was strongly reduced in the presence of sn <dig> .

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated that exposure to micromolar hcy concentrations triggered redox state alterations in neuro2a cell cultures. one cannot exclude that the use here of d, l-homocysteine might have led to somewhat unphysiological results. however, d, l-homocysteine has been widely used in several experimental models, and the results observed are superimposable with physiological responses. indeed, our observations agree with previous results showing a ros-mediated alterations following hcy exposure  <cit> . although the precise mechanisms by which hcy increases oxidative stress are not yet completely understood, the prevention of hcy-induced toxicity by catalase suggests that hydrogen peroxide plays a role as a mediator of oxidative injury leading to apoptosis  <cit> . indeed, folic acid supplementation has a protective effect on hcy-induced oxidative stress by reducing intracellular superoxide levels and, to a lesser extent, quenching hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . moreover, hcy, inhibiting the expression of antioxidant enzymes as well as the synthesis of radical scavengers , might potentiate the toxic effects of ros  <cit> . also, hcy decreases the tissue levels of vitamins a, c and e, thereby reducing the antioxidant reserves  <cit> .

on the other hand, antioxidant treatment with nac and vitamin e can prevent oxyradical generation in neuroblastoma cells related to increased hcy or reduced folic acid  <cit> . based on these evidence, we chose to test hcy effects in the presence of the antioxidant irfi  <dig>  a synthetic vitamin e analogue, that has previously been demonstrated to be protective against oxidative stress induced by excitotoxic amino acid  <cit> . interestingly, irfi  <dig> was more effective than nac, the precursor of intracellular glutathione, in reducing hcy-increased ros levels. further, irfi  <dig> was able to reduce nf-κb nuclear translocation. these effects suggest a cross-talk between oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade in the alterations triggered by hcy in neuro2a cells.

in human hepatoma cells, it has been reported that folate deficiency-induced apoptosis is proceeded via the enhanced activation of nf-κb, which results from the hcy-mediated overproduction of hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . in this study, we also demonstrated that the oxidative stress induced by hcy in neuro2a cells involves the activation of nf-κb, which is inhibited by the antioxidant irfi  <dig>  indeed, nf-κb is a redox-sensitive transcription factor which is crucial in the control of ros-mediated apoptosis. previous reports have shown that nf-κb activation is a part of recovery processes after acute oxidative stress induced by various stimuli, other than excitoxicity, in astroglial cells  <cit> . interestingly, depending on the conditions and the cell type considered, nf-κb activation has been shown to have opposite effects on the brain cell survival. in fact, it has been shown that nf-κb inhibition leads to loss of neuroprotection as well as activated nf-κb induces the expression of anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> gene  <cit> . on the contrary, the activation of nf-κb and increase in the mrna levels of pro-apoptotic bax have also been demonstrated in different stress conditions including amyloid beta -induced oxidative stress in microglial cells  <cit> .

among the κb-responsive genes possibly involved in the control of neuronal cell death, various pro-apoptotic genes are activated upon oxidative stress, and might mediate nf-κb/rel-induced cell death. here, we observed that the hcy-induced nf-κb activation mediated the increase in early protein markers of apoptosis onset, such as bax, caspase- <dig> and p <dig> 

the cysteine proteases, caspases, are considered to play a central role in the apoptotic processes, and trigger the apoptotic cascade of proteolytic cleavage events in mammalian cells  <cit> . the most widely studied member of the caspase family, caspase- <dig>  is one of the key apoptosis executioners that is responsible for the partial or total proteolytic cleavage of many proteins. in addition, the p <dig> protein plays an important role in genotoxic stress, growth arrest, and cell death. translocated nf-κb may affect p <dig> phosphorylation, and subsequently, the decrease of nf-κb activation lead to reduced p <dig> activity, which had been confirmed on neurons exposure to dna damage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
nf-κb activation seems to be a critical event in the onset of hcy-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells neuro2a, given the significant decrease of apoptotic marker expression observed in the presence of sn50-mediated specific nf-κb inhibition. interestingly, the protective effect displayed by the antioxidants irfi  <dig> and nac, reducing caspase- <dig> activity, underscore a major role for oxidative stress in hcy toxic effects.

however, the increase in nf-κb dna binding activity in apoptotic cells did not address cause-effect relationships. considering the dual role of nf-κb in cells survival further investigations are needed to elucidate its function in hcy-induced neuronal cell death.
