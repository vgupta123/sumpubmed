BACKGROUND
increasing emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning nonrenewable fossil fuels causes the earth to warm up by trapping more heat from the atmosphere. a bioenergy alternative to the continued consumption of nonrenewable fossil fuels will avert serious environmental, social and economic concerns for the future. thus, finding renewable alternative fuel sources that are environmentally friendly and economically feasible will achieve a dual goal of improving energy security and decreasing greenhouse gases emissions emitted from the transportation sector and industry  <cit> . an increased attention is given to the lignocellulosic feedstocks as an alternative  <cit>  to starch- and sucrose based feedstocks that are in competition as food crops  <cit> .

switchgrass , a warm-season 4-carbon  fixation perennial grass native to north america, is being developed as source of dedicated biofuel feedstock for production of transportation fuel  <cit> . this choice is attributed to several features of switchgrass such as high biomass yield potential, low external input requirements, and agronomic performance on marginal lands that are too dry and infertile for most other agriculture crops.

switchgrass is a genetically and morphologically diverse species with an array of ploidy levels and classified into two phenotypically distinct ecotypes: lowland and upland  <cit> . this classification is based on strong ecotypic adaptation difference and population structure across the continental range  <cit> , which is based on their ploidy level and morphological variations  <cit> . the lowland ecotypes are generally found in warmer and wetter areas of the southern united states. morphologically, the lowland ecotypes are taller with thicker stems and wider leaves than upland ecotypes. the upland ecotypes are generally smaller in size, have narrower stems and leaves, and produce less biomass than the lowland ecotype. but they are adapted to the dry areas and are capable of overwintering in colder climates of the northern united states.

the causes of genetic diversity in natural populations and the relative influences of ecology versus population history are still largely unknown  <cit> . a switchgrass synthetic cultivar was developed from upland  into lowland  cross and released in the midwestern united states for its better winter survival than the lowland-type and higher biomass yield potential than the upland-type  <cit> . this development of a heterotic cultivar from the upland into lowland ecotype cross echoes the natural process of inter-ecotype breeding for better adaptation. this population can also be used to select genotypes of better biomass yield potential than upland-type and reduce recalcitrance for better biofuel conversion.

the other conspicuous difference between the two switchgrass ecotypes is in the length of vegetative growth; the lowlands regrow early in the spring and flower late in the summer compared to the uplands, which generally have a shorter vegetative growth period as a result of late regrowth coupled with early flowering in the southern great plains . however, intraspecific comparative genome analyses revealed that the lowland and upland ecotypes are completely collinear and have similar recombination rates  <cit> . they intercross freely at same ploidy levels and produce fertile progenies, thus there is free gene flow in both directions. based on the number of marker loci mapped in the lowland genotype ap <dig> and the upland genotype vs <dig>  lower level of genome heterozygosity was speculated for the uplands than the lowlands.

the amount of variation observed between dna sequences from distinct genotypes of a given species is a reflection of genetic diversity  <cit> . analyzing the transcribed portions of the genome is an economical approach for plants with large genome sizes like switchgrass. the functional information derived from the analysis of ests can be used for the development of molecular markers, comparative genomics, genetic analysis of adaptive traits, and gene discovery  <cit> . gene expression variation between tissues or cell types  <cit> , developmental stages  <cit> , genotypes  <cit> , and for differences in stress tolerance  <cit>  have been documented in switchgrass. in addition to the nuclear genome, chloroplast genome sequence variation was also reported for the lowland and upland ecotypes. ecotype comparison of the chloroplast genomes revealed a total of 224 bp of insertions and deletions that the chloroplast sequence of lowland ecotype kanlow  is 58 bp overall longer than the upland ecotype summer with polymorphic rates  between the ecotypes  <cit> . similar levels of intersubspecific polymorphic rates were reported between chloroplast genomes of rice, oryza indica and o. japonica  <cit> . on the other hand, 59 bp deletion in trnl  intron sequences of lowland ecotype ap <dig> chloroplast genome was observed compared to the upland ecotype vs <dig>  <cit> . a bamhi rflp polymorphism in rbcl gene present in upland and absent in lowland cultivars was also reported  <cit> . this polymorphism information between upland and lowland ecotypes would facilitate a study of cultivar diversity, improved analyses of population structure, direction of gene flow and genetic mapping  <cit> .

apart from the distinct phenotypic and chloroplast genome differences, variation in gene expression patterns between lowland and upland ecotypes has not been thoroughly investigated yet. rna-seq analysis is reported as the most effective strategy that can be used to discover new genes as well as to provide high-density markers  <cit> . in this study we assessed the differential gene expression profiles of upland and lowland ecotypes in tetraploid representative genotypes using rna-seq and examined the ests for development of molecular markers useful for mapping agronomic and adaptive traits in switchgrass. the outcome of this investigation in addition to broadening our understanding of the ecotypic differences in switchgrass, it can be applied in molecular breeding to fast-track the development of improved cultivars for yield and quality for biofuel conversion. the rna-seq data is also used to better understand the transcriptomic differences that are reflected in the morphological and ecological adaptation of the lowland and upland ecotypes, especially during active growth stages. the high-throughput markers developed in this study will also facilitate the accurate and efficient discrimination of the heterogeneous switchgrass gene pools  <cit> .

RESULTS
rna-seq data acquisition and reads mapping to switchgrass reference genome
transcriptome of switchgrass ecotypes was profiled using two lowland genotypes  and an upland genotype  that are tetraploids . a high-throughput rna-seq data set was generated for these three genotypes that provide transcriptome analysis through quantitative readouts  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  million 100 bp reads were obtained for the three genotypes from three biological replicates. out of the  <dig>  million reads,  <dig>  million quality reads were aligned to the reference switchgrass genome sequence, p. virgatum v <dig>  . these reads were then used for a reference-guided assembly and differential expression analysis.

the total number of reads obtained were significantly higher in vs <dig>  than in ap <dig>  and k <dig>  . a total of  <dig> %  for ap <dig>   <dig> %  for k <dig>  and  <dig> %  for vs <dig> were mapped to the reference genome. the result indicated that there was no significant difference  among the three genotypes in the number of reads mapped to the reference genome. as increasing the number of replicate samples improves detection power over increased sequencing depth  <cit> , three biological replicates for each genotype were used in this experiment for read mapping and downstream analysis such as assembly of gene transcripts and differential profiling. analysis of variance among the biological replicates were not significant, which implies high repeatability of the samples . however, an average of  <dig> % of the reads could not be mapped to the p. virgatum v <dig>  switchgrass preliminary release reference genome, probably due to incomplete genome coverage of the reference sequence. as the number of mapped sequences were large enough to successfully assemble transcripts with reasonable depth and coverage, no separate de novo assembly was conducted for the unmapped sequences.fig.  <dig> total mapped and unmapped rna-seq clean reads for the three genotypes representing lowland  and upland  switchgrass ecotypes




differentially expressed genes between genotypes and ecotypes
mapping the quality trimmed pair-end reads of the ap <dig>  k <dig> and vs <dig> genotypes representing the ecotypes of switchgrass enabled us to construct a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts. the total number of differentially expressed transcripts  were  <dig>  between ap <dig> and vs <dig>   <dig>  between ap <dig> and k <dig>  and  <dig>  between k <dig> and vs <dig> . among the largest number of differentially expressed transcripts ,  <dig>  were annotated genes and had homologs in either arabidopsis or rice genome as determined by slimgo terms. the remaining  <dig>  were not annotated as gene transcripts.

three-way comparison of  <dig>  in ap <dig>   <dig>  in k <dig>  and  <dig>  in vs <dig> upregulated transcripts highlighted ecotype difference than genotype differences . ecotype difference in gene expression was apparent by the smaller number of commonly upregulated transcripts between the ecotypes  as compared to the  <dig>  between ap <dig> and k <dig>  the two genotypes of the lowland ecotype.fig.  <dig> comparisons of differential gene expression  among two lowland  and an upland  switchgrass genotypes  constructed using cufflinks v <dig> . <dig>  . the comparison reveals distinct ecotype differences as compared to two genotypes within the lowland ecotype




the expression level of the gene transcripts ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  fpkm  in all the three genotypes. among the total transcripts detected in the three genotypes, differential expression analysis also revealed that a total of  <dig>  genes had no detection in ap13; similarly  <dig>  and  <dig>  had no detection in k <dig> and vs <dig>  respectively. these under detected genes may also designate the ecotype variations due to gene expression level or high degree of sequence divergence, but their function has not yet been discerned.

there was significant differential expression between ap <dig> and k5; upregulation of gene transcripts related to photosynthesis were the most significantly enriched go categories amongst the degs between the ecotypes. annotation of the putative genes that were upregulated in both the lowland ecotypes encode chloroplast precursors, photosynthetic electron transport system and associated atp synthesis . some of these upregulated genes encode carbonic anhydrase, cytochrome b6-f complex iron-sulfur subunit, ferredoxin-nadp reductase, phosphoribulokinase, photosystem i reaction center subunit, photosystem ii 10 kda polypeptide, photosystem ii reaction center w protein, pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, ribosomal protein l <dig>  ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and transketolase. genes encoding photosynthetic electron transport system  were also among the upregulated group in the lowland ecotype. it is evident that many gene products encode the two main steps of photosynthesis  <cit> , and the number of genes expressed can affect the inherent photosynthetic activity and environmental stress responses in different ecotypes.

chlorophyll concentration is the main factor  affecting the rate of photosynthesis reaction as it absorbs the light energy, without which the reactions cannot take place. therefore, the expression of photosynthetic genes in the nucleus is influenced by the retrograde  signaling that utilizes photosynthetic electron transport and redox signaling  <cit> . the differential expression of photosynthesis-related genes specifically in the lowland-types suggests the exceedingly efficient light absorption and higher photosynthetic rate of this ecotype. higher content of photoreceptor proteins and non-protein photo-pigments contribute to the higher light absorption efficiency and photosynthetic rate in the lowland ecotype than the upland ecotype.

in addition, genes involved in plant response and adaptation to stresses such as peroxiredoxin, glutathione s-transferase, dehydrin, fatty acid desaturase and hypoxia-responsive family protein were significantly upregulated in both the lowland genotypes compared to the upland genotype. as the plants were not subjected to any stress during the experiment, the high expression of such stress-responsive genes indicates that these proteins may have other functions in the plant growth and development that may reflect the difference between the switchgrass ecotypes. for instance, peroxiredoxin functions as a peroxidase to sense and regulate local peroxides  <cit>  and has a vital role in antioxidant defense in photosynthesis, and respiration that is modulating redox signaling during development  <cit> . atpases  associated with diverse cellular activities and calvin cycle protein chloroplast protein  <dig>  were significantly upregulated in the two lowland genotypes  than the upland vs <dig>  the upregulation of atpases indicate high dephosphorylation reaction in lowlands to release energy to facilitate other chemical reactions that would not otherwise take place. cp <dig> is a small, redox-sensitive protein involved in thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the key enzymes of the reductive pentose phosphate cycle  such as nadh-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in response to changes in light intensity  <cit> .

on the contrary, catalases, heavy-metal-associated domain-containing protein, helix-loop-helix dna-binding domain containing protein, late embryogenesis abundant group  <dig>  protease inhibitors, methyltransferases, nadp-dependent oxidoreductase, and s-adenosylmethionine synthetase were upregulated in the upland vs <dig> compared to the lowland ecotype . transcriptional regulatory proteins such as helix-loop-helix dna-binding domain containing protein may have likely roles in a wide array of developmental processes in plant. the oxidoreductase enzymes also play crucial role in electron transport of a wide variety of chemical reactions in the plant cell.table  <dig> gene transcripts differentially upregulated in upland vs <dig> as compared to the lowlands ap <dig> and k <dig> switchgrass with more than two-fold change 




as light is the prime source of energy for plant growth and morphogenesis, variation in light harvesting may arise from morphological and physiological differences in plants. this result showed that the southern-adapted lowlands seemed more efficient in photosynthesis than the uplands. as gene expression is the result of environmental and developmental changes, transcriptome divergence between the two ecotypes implies adaptive phenotypic selection  <cit> , and the pattern underlying the adaptive evolution occurred between the two ecotypes to adapt to their current habitat. the lowlands are adapted to the southern continental usa with relatively longer growing season and high solar radiation. it is evident that the lowland ecotypes have maintained efficient light perception and carbon reduction mechanism, which ultimately transformed into high biomass accumulation. on the other hand, the uplands are adapted to the shorter growing season of the upper latitudes and have reduced plant stature, which may be due to the low light reception and carbon reduction efficiency. with the hypothetical south-to-north migration path of switchgrass  <cit> , we speculate that the upland ecotypes were derived from the lowland ecotypes through loss of function adaptive evolution.

gene ontology  enrichment of degs
among the significant biological processes, cellular process, and cellular component  organization and localization were significantly higher  in the ap <dig> as compared to the reference . the percentage of cellular components such as macromolecular complex, cell and organelle were higher in ap <dig> than the proportion in the reference annotated pool. the proportion of most of the molecular functions, except structural molecular activity, was significantly lower in ap <dig> than the reference pool. none of the annotations of the vs <dig> was significantly different from the reference pool in proportion. however, cellular process and regulation of biological process in the biological process; cell, cell part, organelle and organelle part in the cellular component; and enzymatic activity and catalytic activity among the molecular function were higher in proportion but not significantly different from the reference . this implies that the variation in ecotype is not in a particular set of gene families but in the overall level of expression across a wide range of gene families.fig.  <dig> the gene ontology  terms in the three go domains  that are significantly  overrepresented in the lowland compared to the custom annotated reference switchgrass genome  as analyzed using agrigo and slim-go

identification of snps and indels between genotypes and ecotypes
homozygous and heterozygous snps discovered for vs <dig> and k <dig> against the reference ap <dig> genome were presented in fig.  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were discovered at ≥100x coverage and ≥5% minor allele frequency for vs <dig> and k <dig>  respectively . the  <dig>  snps that were different between vs <dig> and k <dig> may reflect the ecotype variation for the polymorphism. for vs <dig>  except for c/a, c/t, g/a, and g/t, the number of homozygous snps are larger in number than the heterozygous snps. on the contrary, for k <dig>  heterozygous snps are larger in number than the homozygous snps for each of the transition as well as transversion snps. among the  <dig> types of snps assessed, based on the allele combinations, it was observed that c/t, g/a, a/g and t/c are the abundant snps detected for both k <dig> and vs <dig> individually against the reference genome . in both the vs <dig> and k <dig>  the snps of a/t or t/a were less represented. this implies that transition mutations within pyrimidine  and purine  are more prevalent than the transversion mutation, which converts pyrimidine bases into purines or the vice versa.fig.  <dig> number of snps detected for k5  and vs <dig>  against the reference ap <dig> alleles at ≥100x coverage and ≥5% minor allele frequency. counts for all possible allele combinations of the query and the reference  were graphed for homozygous and heterozygous snps




among the snps identified, 66%  of k <dig> and 64%  of vs <dig> were mapped on the reference ap <dig> pseudomolecules. the distribution of snps detected for k <dig> and vs <dig> were visualized on the reference genome’s pseudomolecules . the overall distribution indicated that there is high density of snps in distal  regions than the proximal end of the chromosomes. there are uneven distributions among the chromosome arms indicating some part of the genome have high recombination events than the others. there are also several gaps on each of the chromosomes, which are potential centromeres. in chromosome 7a and 7b, one arm has higher density than the other. on the other hand, chromosome 8a and 8b, had the least snps overall, distributed across both arms. from the linkage mapping it was not possible to form chromosome 7a and the probable reason was predicted as either high homozygosity or aneuploidy  <cit> . from this low snp density we could substantiate that high homozygosity is more relevant for the disappearance of the linkage group using the pcr-based and dart markers.fig.  <dig> distribution at base-pair locations of snp variants called from rna-seq transcripts for k <dig> and vs <dig> against the reference ap <dig> genome sequence. the distribution is depicted on nine homeologous pseudomolecules of switchgrass genome 




next generation sequencing  technology has been used to detect snps in crops such as wheat , barley   <cit> , cotton   <cit> , rice   <cit> , soybean   <cit> , potato   <cit>  and sorghum   <cit> . dna sequence changes in the non-coding region of the genome may disrupt functional cis-regulatory elements that control transcription and leads to change in transcription levels, while mutation in the protein coding regions leads to altered form of protein  <cit> . these snps are from gene sequences and indicate allelic variations among genotypes and/or between ecotypes for the genes expressed at different levels.

all of the snps detected on the unanchored contigs in or near the gene sequences were screened at 100x coverage and 5% minor allele frequency. in addition to the snps, indel polymorphism for k <dig> and vs <dig> identified relative to the reference genome were presented in additional file 5: table s <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> indels were observed for vs <dig> and k <dig>  again, high indels were detected between the lowland ap <dig> and the upland vs <dig>  implying allelic differences in genes transcribed between the two ecotypes.

conserved simple sequence repeats  among the genotypes
with the aim of developing ssr markers that are polymorphic among genotypes and ecotypes, a de novo assembly was done for the k <dig> and vs <dig> transcripts. consequently,  <dig>  est-ssrs that are conserved among the two and three genotypes were identified . among the three genotypes,  <dig> genic ssrs were detected, while the remaining  <dig> were between a pair of genotypes. the conserved ssrs were also polymorphic among at least two of the three genotypes. genic ssrs were developed for switchgrass from different genotypes  <cit>  of which some were used for genetic linkage mapping of the switchgrass genome .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, comparison of expression profiles between the lowland and the upland ecotypes of switchgrass during active growing stage disclosed a clear difference in photosynthetic efficiency between the two ecotypes. a genome-wide differential upregulation of chloroplast precursors and photosystem proteins in the lowland compared to the upland ecotype revealed that the lowland ecotype is more efficient in photosynthesis than the upland ecotype. the go annotation of the transcripts indicated that lowland ecotype has significantly higher photosynthesis machinery for efficient light perception and more carbon fixation. a number of snp and conserved ssr markers that were polymorphic between genotypes and ecotypes were detected throughout the genome. this discovery would be a useful resource for trait mapping and gene transfer across ecotypes to significantly facilitate switchgrass breeding for increased biomass yield and biofuel conversion.
