BACKGROUND
foot-and-mouth disease virus , causing foot-and-mouth disease , is a contagious virus affecting cloven-hoofed domestic  and wild animals. fmdv has been detected in > <dig> countries worldwide, mostly in asia, africa, and the middle east  <cit> . the fmd causes economic losses to the livestock population and reduces food security and economic development. for this reason, fao and oie have launched a necessary strategy for global fmd control.

fmdv, a picornavirus, is the prototypical member of the aphthovirus genus within the picornaviridae family. the virus particle is about 25–30 nm in diameter and roughly spherical in shape  <cit> . similar to that of other picornaviruses, the fmdv genome organization consists of a large single open reading frame that encodes for the structure proteins, vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig>  and vp <dig> , in which vp <dig>  vp <dig>  and vp <dig> are surface proteins; while vp <dig> is located internally.

fmdv is well identified as having seven immunological distinct serotypes, including serotype o, a, c, asia  <dig>  and the south african territories  serotypes  subsequently with numerous identified subtypes  <cit> . the infection of a single viral serotype does not confer, in consequence, the full protection against the infection of other viral serotypes  <cit> . the fmdv serotype a has been considered to be one of the most antigenically diverse among the seven serotypes  <cit> . the fmdv serotype a has been classified into  <dig> major genotypes  based on the vp <dig> phylogenetic trees  <cit> . fmdv serotype o is classified into  <dig> topotypes, designated as europe-south america , middle east-south asia , southeast asia , cathay , west africa , east africa  <dig> , east africa  <dig> , east africa  <dig> , east africa  <dig> , indonesia- <dig> , and indonesia- <dig>   <cit> ; and fmdv serotype asia  <dig> is classified into seven genotypes   <cit> .

fmd is an endemics and widespread disease in african, asia, and its further spread into the fmd-free areas like american, europe, and australia is a direct threat  <cit> . among seven serotypes of fmdv, serotype o and a have been distributed extensively and are responsible for outbreaks in asia and africa; the three sat serotypes have been generally restricted in their distribution to africa, and the serotype asia  <dig> has never been found outside of asia  <cit> .

agriculture plays an important role in the national economy of vietnam, in which animal production contributes about approximately 32% to the total gdp. fmd is considered the most economically important infectious disease affecting domestic cattle, buffalo, and pigs. the concurrent circulation of fmdv serotypes o, a, and asia  <dig> are detected in which the serotype o remains the most prevalent and is responsible for the highest numbers of outbreaks  <cit> . the fmdv serotype o and its outbreak in vietnam were first described in academic research between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the fmdv serotype asia  <dig> and a were subsequently identified in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in  <dig> and the first 2 months of  <dig>  the fmdv serotypes o and a were reported to be the prevalent serotype and caused approximately  <dig> fmd outbreaks in  <dig> communes in  <dig> districts of  <dig> provinces throughout the country  <cit> .

currently, limited information is available regarding the genetic characteristics and geographical distribution of the fmdv serotype o and a causing sporadic outbreaks in vietnam. in this study, the vp <dig> coding gene of  <dig> fmdv samples  collected from endemic outbreaks during 2006– <dig> were analyzed to investigate their phylogeny and genetic relationship with other available fmdvs globally. these data will provide important evidence of recent movement of fmdvs serotype o and a into vietnam within the last decade and their genetic characterization with strains causing fmd in neighboring countries.

methods
sample collection and virus isolation
a total of  <dig> fmd-positive samples were collected in a passive surveillance program from  <dig> provinces located in north and northern central vietnam during 2006– <dig> . all the virus isolates were initially confirmed by fmdv antigen elisa  and then isolated from the bhk- <dig> cell culture system with subsequence passages. briefly, bhk- <dig> cells were cultured in minimum essential medium  supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum  and  <dig> % gentamicin  at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co <dig>  the epithelial homogenate was centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then filtered by using a  <dig> -μm sterile syringe filter . the filtered samples were inoculated into a monolayer of bhk- <dig> cells at 37 °c for 1 h, followed by two washes with mem media. the infected cells were maintained in mem media containing 2% fbs. infected cells were harvested after 2–4 days post-infection and were subsequently passed into the bhk- <dig> cells until cytopathic effects appeared. the names of the isolates were assigned as follow: serotype, country code, laboratory record number, and the year of sample collection, and stored at −80 °c for further exam .table  <dig> origin of the serotypes o and a fmdvs sisolated in this study

discussion
the sequences of the vp <dig> coding gene are widely used to identify and characterize fmdv lineages and sub-lineages  <cit> . in addition, the vp <dig> capsid protein is the most helpful protein to investigate the relationship between different isolates of the fmdv because of its significance for viral attachment and entry, protective immunity, and serotype specificity  <cit> . in this study, we used the vp <dig> coding region of the fmdv serotype o and type a isolated from the north and northern central regions of vietnam during 2006– <dig> for the determination of their phylogeny and genetic relationships with other available vietnamese and global fmdv strains in the ncbi genebank database. importantly, the  <dig> provinces enrolled in this study have historically been highly affected by fmdvs and share both a border and a trade of animals with the highly affected fmdv countries of china, laos, cambodia, and thailand  <cit> .

the fmdv serotype o is the most prevalent out of the seven serotypes that circulate in many parts of the world. the fmd outbreaks of type o viruses were first identified in  <dig> from fmd outbreaks in europe by analysis of its nucleotide sequence  <cit> . based on the accumulation of vp <dig> genome sequences,  <dig> topotypes of fmdv serotype o were designated as the euro-sa, me-sa, sea, chy, wa, ea- <dig>  ea- <dig>  ea- <dig>  isa- <dig>  and isa- <dig>  the topotypes me-sa and sea highly affect china, the indian subcontinent , and southeast asian countries . the vietnamese fmdv serotype o fell within the me-sa , sea , and cathay topotypes in which the isolates form distinct genetic sub-lineages and are distant from the prototype isolates. these findings highlight that these topotypes might have adapted in recent years to circulate in vietnam.

the fmdv serotype a has been reported in all fmdv infected areas around the world. based on the phylogeny analysis of the vp <dig> capsid genes, the global fmdv serotype a is divided into  <dig> major genotypes  with over 15% nucleotide divergence  <cit> . in vietnam, these viruses were reported to be predominant during the outbreaks between  <dig> and  <dig> in the northern central regions of the country  <cit> . genetic characterization of six serotype a strains isolated from the northern central regions of vietnam revealed that the vietnamese fmdv serotype a strains were all clustered into the genotype ix  and shared close relation to the recent fmdv serotype a strains isolated in laos, thailand, and malaysia  <cit> . the fmdv serotype a strains in this study were also clustered into the genotype ix, together with the strains isolated between  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, the strains isolated in  <dig> clustered into a single sub-cluster and showed distance from previous isolates. these results indicated the genetic variation of the fmdv serotype a strains and their persistent circulation in vietnam, particularly in the north and northern central regions.

available since the early 1900s, the fmdv vaccine continues to plays a significant role in the protection of animals against fmdv-related morbidity and mortality; however, the vaccinated individuals could only be protected for a specific serotype and/or subtype, and this protection is only valid for a short term  <cit> . the concurrent circulation of fmd outbreaks of the fmdv serotype o, a, and asia  <dig> and its genetic variation may apply pressure for the selection of effective vaccine strains to prevent and control fmdv outbreaks in vietnam  <cit> . these points also suggest that more fmdv surveillance studies will be necessary in order to evaluate the genetic relationship and efficacy of the current used vaccines against different fmdv serotypes circulating in vietnam.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides valuable information on the genetic variation among the fmdvs serotype o and a circulating in vietnam during 2006– <dig>  and likely indicates transmission between neighboring countries in southeast asia, such as myanmar, thailand, cambodia, malaysia, and laos.
