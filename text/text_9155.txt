BACKGROUND
endolysins are enzymes produced by bacteriophages  at the end of their life cycles to lyse the cell walls of host cells and release mature progeny phage particles  <cit> . most endolysins require a second phage protein, holin, to create pores in the cytomembrane and enable them to pass through to reach their substrate, a cell wall peptidoglycan  <cit> . because of their potential as novel antibacterial agents, the characteristics of several endolysins have previously been studied  <cit> .

endolysins of phages isolated from gram-positive bacteria typically contain two functional domains, the n-terminal catalytic domain and the c-terminal cell wall binding domain  <cit> . the catalytic domain belongs to one of the four families of peptidoglycan hydrolases, which are classified according to catalytic site-specificity: n-acetylglucosaminidases, n-acetylmuramidases , n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases, and endopeptidases  <cit> . by contrast, the cell wall binding domain is divergent and can distinguish discrete cell wall epitopes. usually, one cell wall binding domain determines the endolysin strain specificity  <cit> ; however, there are sometimes more than one  <cit>  or even no cell wall binding domains  <cit> . the endolysin c-terminus nevertheless sometimes appears to be essential for catalytic activity, as several reports showed that the enzymatic activity is abolished after removal of the c-terminus  <cit> .

bacillus thuringiensis belongs to the bacillus cereus group, which includes two very closely related species: b. cereus and bacillus anthracis <cit> . b. thuringiensis is an insect pathogen that forms an insecticidal crystal protein during sporulation  <cit> . b. anthracis is the anthrax pathogen, while b. cereus is a food contaminant  <cit> . because of the multidrug resistance of b. anthracis <cit> , several of its phage or prophage endolysins have been expressed, purified, and characterized. there have also been some attempts to use these endolysins to cure the disease caused by b. anthracis <cit> . practical applications of endolysins were enabled by studies on functional domain composition, optimal reaction conditions, and species- or strain-specificity. for example, combining the catalytic domain of one endolysin with the cell wall binding domain of another changed the specificity or activity  <cit> .

until now, only two bacterial cell wall hydrolases from b. thuringiensis phage gil <dig> have been reported  <cit> , and little is known about their functional domain composition. the lytic activity of one of these hydrolases was limited to b. thuringiensis israelensis, while the other exhibited a broader cleavage spectrum in lysing two other gram-positive species, b. subtilis and micrococcus lysodeikticus.

phage btcs <dig> is a siphoviridae family member that was isolated from b. thuringiensis kurstaki strain cs- <dig>  <cit> . the btcs <dig> genome has been sequenced and a potential endolysin gene, orf <dig>  was identified using bioinformatics. the gene product was named plybt <dig>  in this study, we analyzed the functional domain composition of plybt <dig> using bioinformatics, and then demonstrated its biological activity after separately expressing the catalytic and cell wall binding domains in escherichia coli. plybt <dig> showed a broad lytic spectrum against the tested bacillus strains. additionally, its cell wall binding domain exhibited low amino acid sequence similarity to previously reported domains.

RESULTS
identification and domain composition of endolysin from phage btcs33
position-specific iterated blast  analysis of the phage btcs <dig> genome identified orf <dig> as the gene encoding the endolysin plybt <dig>  amino acid sequence alignment of plybt <dig> with several endolysins from bacillus phages or prophages  revealed high similarity to plyph  <cit>  and plyba <dig>  <cit>  , but low similarity to plyg  <cit> , plyl  <cit> , and ply <dig>  <cit>  .

pfam and cdd analysis showed that plybt <dig> was composed of two functional domains , the n-terminal catalytic domain  and the c-terminal cell wall binding domain . figure 1b showed the pfam analysis of four endolysins from bacillus phages, and indicated that the n-terminus of plybt <dig> was a gh <dig> family hydrolase domain, while the c-terminus was an amidase02_c domain. plybt <dig> exhibited the same domain composition as plyph, but differed from plyg and ply <dig>  according to homology-based endolysin classification  <cit> , plybt <dig> is a putative member of the n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases.

expression and purification of endolysin
to determine the function of the entire plybt <dig> protein, the n-terminal region , and the c-terminus combined with the internal region  , we constructed three recombinant strains and induced protein expression with isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactoside . sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  analysis showed that the three observed molecular weights coincided with their theoretical weights of  <dig> kda,  <dig> kda, and  <dig> kda, respectively. sds-page analysis also showed that the purity of each protein following ni-nta purification exceeded 90% .

lytic activity of plybt33
the relationship between different concentrations of plybt <dig> and their corresponding lytic activities was tested. figure  <dig> showed a linear relationship from  <dig>  μm to  <dig> μm. for further assays, we used a final concentration of  <dig> μm as this concentration lies within the linear activity range of plybt <dig>  the lytic activities of plybt33-n and plybt33-ic were investigated to determine the active region of plybt <dig>  the results revealed that plybt33-n but not plybt33-ic lysed b. thuringiensis strain hd- <dig> . this suggested that the active region of plybt <dig> was the n-terminus, although the lytic activity of plybt33-n was relatively low when compared with plybt <dig> . to detect the lytic spectrum of plybt <dig>  the lytic activity of purified plybt <dig> was tested against b. thuringiensis strains hd- <dig>  hd- <dig>  four b. thuringiensis isolates, b. subtilis, b. pumilus, b cereus, b. anthracis, and the gram-negative strains p. aeruginosa, y. pseudotuberculosis, and e. coli. plybt <dig> lysed all bacillus strains tested, but not the gram-negative strains. the lytic activity against b. thuringiensis was low, but was much higher against b. subtilis and b. pumilus , which corresponded with previous reports  <cit> . furthermore, plybt <dig> lysed b. cereus and b. anthracis with higher lytic activity.

the effects of ph and temperature on plybt <dig> lytic activity were investigated. lytic activity against the tested strains was observed in the ph range of  <dig> – <dig> , with an optimal ph of  <dig>  . the optimum reaction temperature was 50°c , and lytic activity gradually decreased as temperature increased from 30–60°c . following treatments at 40°c and 60°c for  <dig> h, lytic activity was reduced by 40% and 60%, respectively.

cell wall binding activity of plybt33-ic
according to previous reports, the c-termini of several characterized gram-positive endolysins comprised one or several sh <dig> family cell wall binding domains  <cit> . pfam analysis of plybt <dig> showed that the plybt <dig> c-terminus consisted of an amidase02_c domain, which was present in several endolysins  <cit> . we aligned the plybt <dig> c-terminus with other characterized cell wall binding domains from bacillus phage or prophage endolysins, and observed limited similarity. however, the highest similarity was found with the c-termini of plyg, plyl, plyba <dig>  and plyph . kikkawa et al. previously reported that amino acid residues l <dig> and q <dig> of endolysin plyg were critical for the cell wall binding activity of plyg to b. anthracis <cit> . figure  <dig> showed that plybt <dig> and plyg shared identical l <dig> residues but differred at amino acid  <dig> 

the plybt <dig> c-terminus was expressed, purified, and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate . after mixing fitc-plybt33-ic with the bacterial suspension for  <dig> min, the cells were visualized under a fluorescence microscope, and binding between fitc-plybt33-ic and the surface of b. thuringiensis hd- <dig> was apparent . the binding ability assay was also repeated with a higher fitc-plybt33-ic concentration . at this concentration, homogenous binding of fitc-plybt33-ic to the cell surface was observed , in contrast to the random binding pattern seen at the lower concentration. fitc-labeled bovine serum albumin  showed no binding to hd- <dig> , and the hd- <dig> cell suspensions used as a control showed no fluorescence . fitc-plybt33-ic also bound to b. subtilis  <dig>  while no binding was detected in e. coli . the binding activity of plybt33-ic was consistent with its lytic specificity.

discussion
in the present work, we expressed and determined the activity of endolysin plybt <dig> from b. thuringiensis phage btcs <dig>  the endolysin was found to be a putative n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, and was composed of an n-terminal catalytic domain and a c-terminal cell wall binding domain. plybt <dig> maintained 40% of its lytic activity against bacterial cells following treatment at 60°c for  <dig> h.

though plybt <dig> exhibited a high sequence similarity  to endolysin plyph, their characteristics were quite different. plyph was a b. anthracis putative prophage origin endolysin that could lyse b. anthracis and b. cereus, and had a broad optimal ph range   <cit> . by contrast, plybt <dig> exhibited lytic activity between ph  <dig> – <dig> , with an optimal ph of  <dig> . the differences between the amino acid sequences of these two endolysins may cause differences in pi  and different surface net charges. low et al. <cit>  reported that the net charge of endolysin plyba <dig> influenced its lytic activity and specificity, which might explain the different ph ranges of these two endolysins. moreover, the lytic spectrums of plybt <dig> and plyph were also different. plybt <dig> could hydrolyze all tested bacillus strains from five different species, while plyph could only lyse b. anthracis and b. cereus. alignments of the putative cell wall binding domains of plybt <dig> and plyph revealed a low similarity . according to previous reports, cell wall binding was essential in the host range determination of the endolysin  <cit> , and this might be the cause of the different target-specificities of plybt <dig> and plyph. the same phenomenon was observed in endolysin plyg   <cit> , which showed high similarity to plyph and low similarity to plybt <dig> at the putative cell wall binding region. contrarily, b. anthracis endolysin plyl showed low similarity to plybt <dig> at the putative cell wall binding region, but exhibited a relatively broad lytic spectrum. both endolysins could lyse strains of b. anthracis, b. cereus, and b. subtilis <cit> . we speculated that this was either because the different cell wall binding domains recognized the same cell wall epitope, or that there were various cell wall epitopes available for binding. because of the low similarity of the plybt <dig> cell wall binding domain with others, we inferred that it might be a novel type of cell wall binding domain.

we observed random binding of the fitc labeled cell wall binding proteins with ligands on the cell surface . the concentration used of the fitc labeled cell wall binding proteins  was low, and as such only parts of the ligands were bound by the fitc labeled cell wall binding proteins. when a higher concentration  was used, the fitc labeled cell wall binding proteins bound uniformly to the cell surface . these results suggested a homogenous distribution of ligands on the cell surface, which agrees with the findings of previous reports  <cit> .

in previous reports, the lytic activity of plyl increased after removing the c-terminal region  <cit> , while the lytic activity of plyg was reduced  <cit> . though the similarity between the n-terminal regions of plyg and plyl was high, they each exhibited distinct features. the similarity of plybt <dig> to plyg and plyl was low; therefore we decided to investigate the influence of the c-terminus on the lytic activity of plybt <dig>  in this study, when the c-terminus of plybt <dig> was removed, the lytic activity was reduced. we speculated that this was due to the c-terminus assisting in the binding of plybt <dig> to the catalytic epitope on the cell wall of target bacteria, which benefits the catalysis of plybt <dig> 

plybt <dig> had a relatively high thermostability, which, combined with its high lytic activity against b. cereus   <cit> , suggested that it had the potential to be an extremely useful antimicrobial agent in food production processes involving heat treatment  <cit> . plybt <dig> also exhibited a high lytic activity against b. anthracis, which indicated that it could be used in the treatment of anthrax  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the endolysin plybt <dig> was composed of two functional domains, the n-terminal catalytic domain and the c-terminal cell wall binding domain. the c-terminus of plybt <dig> might be a novel kind of cell wall binding domain. plybt <dig> lysed all tested bacillus strains from five different species. optimal conditions for plybt <dig> were ph  <dig>  and 50°c, and plybt <dig> was also found to be relatively thermostable. these characteristics indicated that plybt <dig> might be an extremely useful antimicrobial agent in food production processes that involve heat treatment, and in the treatment of anthrax.
