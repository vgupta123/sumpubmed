BACKGROUND
plants need to sense and respond to mechanical stresses, such as wind, touch, and changes in osmotic pressure  <cit> . elevation of cytosolic free ca2+ concentration  is induced in response to various stimuli, such as chemical, physical, and mechanical stimuli  <cit> . during this process, cyt levels rise through the opening of ca2+ channels located on the plasma membrane and endomembranes. electrophysiological and bioinformatic studies have revealed the existence of plasma membrane ca2+-permeable channels activated by mechanical stimuli, although the structural entity involved and their physiological functions remain largely unknown  <cit> .

molecular and electrophysiological studies have shown that arabidopsis thaliana msl <dig> and msl <dig>  homologs of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel mscs, are required for mechanosensitive channel activity in the plasma membrane of root cells, and are more permeable to cl- than ca2+  <cit> . we have recently identified two plasma membrane proteins as putative ca2+-permeable mechanosensitive channels, mca <dig>  and mca <dig> , from arabidopsis  <cit> , and showed that ectopic overexpression of mca <dig> increases ca2+ uptake in roots, and also enhances cyt elevation upon hypo-osmotic shock. however, the direct effects of mca proteins on osmotic-induced ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane and the osmotic signaling pathways are little understood.

upon recognition of osmotic signals, plant cells initiate activation of a widespread signal transduction network that induces second messengers and triggers inducible defense responses. characteristic early signaling events include ca2+ influx, protein phosphorylation and generation of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . these downstream events are often prevented when ca2+ influx is compromised by either ca2+ chelators, such as ethylene glycol-bis--n, n, n', n'-tetra acetic acid , or ca2+-channel blockers, such as la3+  <cit> . in tobacco cells, hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation reportedly requires activation of mechanosensitive ca2+ channels  <cit> . these results suggest that ca2+ influx mediated by mechanosensitive ca2+ channels is involved in the induction of osmotic signals including ros generation. however, in osmotic responses, molecular bases and regulation mechanisms remain poorly elucidated.

in the present study, we have identified a sole mca ortholog in the rice genome and developed both overexpression and suppression lines. studies of these lines with altered levels of this putative mechanosensitive ca2+ channel indicated that osmca <dig> is involved in regulation of plasma membrane ca2+ influx and ros generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells.

RESULTS
identification of osmca <dig> and its expression patterns
full-length cdna of osmca <dig> was obtained by a rapid amplification of cdna ends -pcr method. it encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  . the predicted protein showed  <dig> % and  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity compared with arabidopsis mca <dig> and mca <dig>  respectively; the toppred program http://www.sbc.su.se/~erikw/toppred2/ suggests that osmca <dig> has two potential transmembrane segments  , while other transmembrane segment prediction programs suggest different numbers of putative transmembrane segments . the plac <dig> motif was found by tmpred prediction http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/tmpred_form.html in the c-terminal region . a database search of the whole genome  indicated that rice has no other homolog of osmca <dig> 

quantitative reverse transcriptase -pcr analysis showed osmca <dig> mrna to be expressed in mature leaves, shoots, roots and suspension-cultured cells, suggesting that osmca <dig> mrna is expressed throughout the plants in seedlings as well as in cultured cells . we also consulted the microarray expression database , showing expression of osmca <dig> mrna throughout the developmental stages, including root, leaf blade, panicle, anther, pistil, and ovary as well as embryo . the spatial pattern of osmca <dig> expression was examined using an osmca <dig> promoter::β-glucuronidase  fusion reporter gene construct . figure 1a shows osmca1p::gus is expressed in the seed, with relatively high levels in embryo. in the seedling stage, osmca1p::gus is highly expressed in proximal and apical regions of shoots . cross sections of the leaves indicate that osmca1p::gus is highly expressed in mesophyll cells, but expressed in vascular tissues at relatively very low levels . osmca1p::gus was also expressed in the root, with relatively high levels in the center of primary root as well as the lateral root primordia . these results suggest that osmca <dig> transcription may be regulated throughout developmental stages. the expression pattern of osmca <dig> was similar to those of the arabidopsis mca <dig> 

intracellular localization of the osmca <dig> protein
to investigate intracellular localization of the osmca <dig> protein, we introduced a green fluorescent protein  construct fused to the coding sequence of the n-terminus of osmca <dig> into tobacco by- <dig> cells and examined its intracellular localization using confocal laser scanning microscopy. when gfp alone was expressed, it localized to the nucleus and the cytoplasm . in contrast, gfp-osmca <dig> fusion protein localized specifically to the plasma membrane . this pattern was reinforced by treatment with a high osmotic solution,  <dig> m mannitol, which induced plasmolysis . in addition, fluorescent images and behavior of gfp-osmca <dig> before and after plasmolysis were different from those of the intracellular staining marker fm4- <dig> , indicating that osmca <dig> is localized to the plasma membrane.

effects of osmca <dig> overexpression on ca2+ uptake in cultured rice cells
to test if osmca <dig> plays a role in ca2+ transport, we generated cultured cells overexpressing osmca <dig> and analyzed whether expression levels of osmca <dig> affected ca2+ uptake activity. as shown in figure 3a, b, ca2+ uptake activity was higher in osmca1-overexpressing cells than in gus-expressing control cells, suggesting that osmca <dig> is involved in ca2+ uptake across the plasma membrane in rice. we also generated osmca1-overexpressing plants, which showed no significant visible phenotypes .

effect of osmca <dig> suppression on growth and development in planta
to elucidate the physiological roles of osmca <dig>  transgenic plants were generated in which osmca <dig> expression was suppressed by rna interference  using gene-specific sequences . five independent transgenic plants were generated using agrobacterium-mediated transformation. non-transgenic plants were investigated simultaneously as controls, whose transduced genes were removed by heterozygous segregation. rt-pcr analyses revealed significant reductions in osmca <dig> mrna levels compared with controls .

the osmca1-suppressed lines showed slower growth in adult plants . though germination rates  and seedling growth of suppression lines were comparable to controls in the murashige and skoog medium  , growth of suppression lines was remarkably retarded after transplantation into soil in a greenhouse, suggesting that osmca <dig> suppression leads to hypersensitivity to environmental stresses. this phenotype was exhibited in all  <dig> independent t <dig> transgenic rnai lines; severity of the phenotypes correlated well with expression levels of osmca <dig> transcripts . furthermore, unlike arabidopsis mca mutants, rachises of the osmca1-suppressed lines were significantly shorter than those of controls , suggesting that osmca <dig> plays a different role from arabidopsis mcas in some developmental stages.

effects of osmca1-suppression on cell growth and ca2+ sensitivity in cultured rice cells
we tested whether osmca <dig> suppression affects ca2+ sensitivity to growth in rice cells. in regular medium containing  <dig> mm of ca2+, growth rates of osmca1-suppressed lines were comparable to controls . in contrast, when ca2+ concentration of the medium was decreased to  <dig>  mm , growth of osmca1-suppressed lines was significantly restricted compared with controls, suggesting possible involvement of osmca <dig> in acquisition of ca2+ for cell growth under ca2+ limitation.

involvement of osmca <dig> in mechanical stress-induced cyt changes
to test for possible involvement of osmca <dig> in regulation of ca2+ influx induced by various stimuli, we generated osmca1-suppressed lines harboring the ca2+-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin . hypo-osmotic shock-induced transient cyt change in cultured rice cells  was inhibited by a ca2+ chelator,  <dig> -bis-ethane-n, n, n', n'-tetra-acetic acid , and ca2+ channel blockers  but not by verapamil, an inhibitor for voltage-dependent ca2+ channels, , suggesting that plasma membrane ca2+ influx mediated by gd3+-sensitive mechanosensitive ca2+-permeable channel is induced by hypo-osmotic shock. the hypo-osmotic shock-induced cyt change was partially impaired in the osmca1-suppressed cells , and was proportional to levels of osmca <dig> expression in various osmca1-suppressed cells. on the other hand, increased cyt triggered by nacetylchito-oligosaccharides, a major microbe-associated molecular pattern  recognized by plasma membrane receptors in rice  <cit> , was not affected by osmca <dig> expression levels . these results suggest that osmca <dig> participates in the plasma membrane ca2+ influx triggered by hypo-osmotic shock but not by mamps.

trinitrophenol  is a potent compound to generate membrane distortion to activate mechanosensitive channels and mimic mechanical stimuli in plants  <cit>  and animal cells. we investigated the effects of tnp on cyt and possible involvement of osmca <dig> in its regulation in cultured rice cells. tnp induced transient cyt change, which was inhibited by bapta, gdcl <dig>  and lacl <dig> but not by verapamil . the pharmacology of cyt transients triggered by hypo-osmotic shock and tnp was basically similar . tnp-induced cyt change was also impaired in osmca1-suppressed lines , suggesting the possible involvement of osmca <dig> as a putative mechanosensitive ca2+-permeable channel in the regulation of mechanical stress-triggered plasma membrane ca2+ influx.

we also tried to examine the effect of overexpression of osmca <dig> on mechanical stress-triggered ca2+ influx. however, we observed a strong reduction in the total aequorin luminescence in all transgenic cell lines overexpressing osmca <dig> . thus it was impossible to measure cyt using osmca1-overexpressing lines. real-time rt-pcr analysis revealed that the expression level of aequorin gene in the osmca1-overexpressing lines was comparable to the control . thus constitutive overexpression of osmca <dig> does not affect the expression but may affect the stability of aequorin protein or inhibit the aequorin chemiluminescence.

effects of osmca1-overexpression on sensitivity to hypo-osmotic shock and generation of reactive oxygen species
hypo-osmotic shock has been shown to trigger ros generation following cyt increase in cultured tobacco cells  <cit> . as osmca <dig> has been suggested to affect regulation of hypo-osmotic shock-induced ca2+ influx , we investigated possible osmca <dig> involvement in hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation in cultured rice cells, using two distinctive methods sensitive for superoxide anion radical  and hydrogen peroxide .

hypo-osmotic shock triggered ros generation within  <dig> min , which was markedly inhibited by ca2+ channel blockers , suggesting an important role f ca2+ influx in hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation . diphenylene iodonium , an nadph oxidase inhibitor, significantly suppressed ros generation . peroxidase-catalyzed reactions have been also proposed for osmotic shock-induced ros generation in cultured tobacco and arabidopsis cells  <cit> . however, a peroxidase inhibitor, salicylhydroxamic acid , scarcely affected hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation , suggesting that a major part of hypo-osmotic shock-induced ros generation is attributable to ros-producing nadph oxidases in cultured rice cells. hypo-osmotic shock-induced generation of both •o2-  and h2o <dig>  was either significantly enhanced or more rapid in osmca1-overexpressing lines than in the control. generation of ros in osmca1-suppressed lines was comparable to the control .

discussion
it has been suggested that ca2+ plays a crucial role in mechanical sensing  <cit> . however, little is known of the molecular mechanisms responsible for ca2+ mobilization. functional characterization of the osmca1-rnai lines as well as overexpressors suggests that osmca <dig> is involved in hypo-osmotic shock-induced ca2+ influx and ros generation.

possible functions of osmca <dig> in the regulation of growth and development of rice
osmca1-suppressed plants displayed stunted growth and shortened rachises . these phenotypes are frequently observed under drought-stress conditions  <cit> . the suppression of osmca <dig> might have affected adaptation to drought. drought stress is known to lead to osmotic stress at a cellular level. since hypo-osmotic shock-induced cyt changes were impaired in the osmca1-suppressed lines, these lines may have defects in osmotic sensing/responses and ability to adapt to drought stress. future studies to characterize physiological reactions to drought and mechanical signaling in osmca1-suppressed plants would further elucidate the in vivo roles of osmca <dig> in intact plants.

in arabidopsis, the mca <dig> mca <dig> double mutant shows a growth defect in soil, and reduced accumulation of ca2+ as well as enhanced sensitivity to mg2+  <cit> . the balance of ca2+ and mg2+ in soil is an important factor for normal plant growth  <cit> . since the growth of the osmca1-suppressed lines was significantly restricted compared with the control under ca2+-limitation , growth retardation in the osmca1-suppressed plants may be attributed to reduced ca2+ uptake, resulting in a low ca2+-mg2+ ratio.

possible involvement of osmca <dig> in osmotic signaling in cultured rice cells
the gfp-osmca <dig> fusion protein localized specifically to the plasma membrane , suggesting that osmca <dig> is a plasma membrane protein. in cultured rice cells, both hypo-osmotic shock- and tnp-induced cyt transients, which were inhibited by la3+ and gd3+, were impaired in osmca1-suppressed lines . the temporal pattern of the mamp-induced cyt transient was similar , but was unaffected by osmca <dig> suppression . these results suggest that osmca <dig> affects regulation of ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in response to mechanical stimulation in cultured rice cells.

hypo-osmotic shock triggers ros generation following a cyt increase  <cit> . extracellular ca2+ is required for both ca2+ influx and nadph oxidase-mediated ros generation induced by hypo-osmotic shock , suggesting that ros generation requires ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. overexpression of osmca <dig> enhances ros generation . binding ca2+ to the ef-hand regions of cytosolic regulatory domains of plant nadph oxidases directly activates them  <cit> . a functional nadph oxidase atrbohc/rhd <dig> reportedly affects mechanical stress-induced ros generation in a ca2+-dependent manner  <cit> . overproduction of the plasma membrane ca2+-permeable channels may induce the mobilization of excess ca2+ in response to mechanical stimuli, which may cause enhanced activation of nadph oxidases.

in osmca1-suppressed lines challenged with hypo-osmotic shock, ca2+ influx was partially impaired , but no significant influence of the impairment on subsequent ros generation was detected under our assay conditions . similar effects of overexpression and a loss-of-function mutation were also observed with another putative ca2+-permeable channel, ostpc <dig>  <cit> . a certain level of ca2+ increment may be sufficient for nadph oxidase-mediated ros generation. alternatively, other ca2+-permeable channels activated by hypo-osmotic shock may redundantly play a role in bypassing osmca <dig>  it has been suggested that arabidopsis msl <dig> and msl <dig>  homologs of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel mscs, are required for mechanosensitive channel activity in root cell plasma membranes, and are able to translocate cations including ca2+  <cit> . rice msl homologs may therefore be candidates for such ca2+-permeable channels.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study indicates that osmca <dig> is involved in regulation of plasma membrane ca2+ influx and nadph oxidase-mediated ros generation induced by hypo-osmotic stress in cultured rice cells. these findings shed light on our understanding of mechanical sensing pathways.
