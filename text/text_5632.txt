BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells most of the proteins are cytosolically translated and many have to be translocated across at least one membrane to reach their place of action
 <cit> . albeit the mode of translocation differs between different translocation systems, they all have in common that they are composed of multiple subunits. translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum  marks a central event as majority of the proteins delivered to other compartments of the cell have their entry point at this membrane, while peroxisome, mitochondria and chloroplast possess their own system for transporting specific proteins across their membranes. translocation of proteins in or across the er membrane takes place either co- or post-translationally, and an er-associated degradation machinery  controls the quality state of the imported proteins
 <cit> . remarkably, the translocon at the peroxisomal membranes are in parts similar to the erad system
 <cit> .

mitochondria possess at least five distinct pathways for the transport of cytosolically synthesized proteins, namely  the “presequence pathway”,  the “carrier pathway”,  the “intermembrane space assembly  pathway”,  the “sorting and assembly of outer membrane β-barrel proteins  pathway”, and  the insertion mode for α-helical outer membrane proteins by the mitochondrial import protein 1
 <cit> . all with the exception of pathway  unify at the translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria .

similar to mitochondria, chloroplasts import several hundreds of nucleus-encoded proteins
 <cit> . the preproteins are recognized by the toc complex, delivered into the intermembrane space  and further transported by the tic complex
 <cit> . recently, a sec system was identified in the inner chloroplast envelope
 <cit> . within chloroplasts, proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membranes or lumen.

thus, protein translocation into or across membranes requires the action of many different proteins. at stage, a general inventory of these proteins in plants has not been established; only few cases have been presented mostly for the model plant a. thaliana <cit> . thus, we aimed at analyzing the complexity and conservation of protein translocation systems in different plant species that have not yet been biochemically approached. for this purpose we performed a bioinformatic blast-dependent orthologue search for putatively involved candidates in  <dig> other plant species on base of the model systems a. thaliana and yeast. we obtained an inventory of orthologues and orthologue. the findings were validated by analyzing the domain architecture, the subsistence of shared synteny and expression in different tissues of arabidopsis and tomato, which facilitates the correlation of orthologues and the search for functional connotation. in this study, we concentrated on the relationship of genes due to lineage-specific duplication and skipped the time-point of the duplication in relation to speciation, which is necessary to call them paralogues
 <cit> . so, we concentrate only at the genomic level and thereby used the terms orthologues and orthologues in our analyses.

the results are exemplified in more detail for tomato, an economically important crop and the model plant for studying fleshy fruit development and ripening as well as wound response
 <cit> . we give an overview concerning conservation and diversification in translocation machineries of different cellular compartments in a cell during genome evolution of viridiplantae. further, we highlight inter-species differences in the conservation of translocons in plants and between plant and yeast in general. we demonstrate that among all the compartments the chloroplast translocases are most conserved with one to one relations in the orthologues from a. thaliana to s. lycopersicum.

RESULTS
the database structure and factor analysis
to gain insight into the molecular composition of the protein translocation systems in intracellular membranes of plant cells, we generated a bioinformatic pipeline for the identification of orthologues and orthologues in plants. primarily, a manual data-mining process was established to collect central components involved in protein translocation based on existing literature in arabidopsis and yeast . the identified components were used to extract their amino acid sequences . then, blast dependent orthologue search was used to identify orthologues in other plant lineages  and to assign the different orthologues of specific factors via their domain structure, synteny and expression pattern .

we identified a total of  <dig> translocation components in yeast and a. thaliana from our literature-based search . the two approaches  were utilized to identify orthologues in plants, which in combination yielded  <dig> and  <dig> orthologues in a. thaliana and s. lycopersicum, respectively . interestingly, we traced 82% overlap in findings from both approaches though we did not find any orthologues for 27% of the factors by either procedure. the latter was majorly accounted by factors of the er system . in turn, 29% of the factors displayed the presence of more than one orthologue in tomato.

with respect to the other plant species  we realized only slight differences in the overall architecture of protein translocation machineries in the respective sub-groups . remarkably, in chlamydomonas reinhardtii most factors are encoded by a single gene with the exception of erv <dig> , pex <dig> , cpseca  and tic <dig> . moreover, physcomitrella patens seems to have a more similar composition of translocation machinery components to higher plants in contrast to the single celled green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii. the monocots follow more or less a similar conservation pattern than the eudicots for encoding the translocon components, although few distinctions were observed concerning the number of orthologues . in contrast, a diverse pattern was observed for the eudicots. generally, we observed higher numbers of orthologues in glycine max  and z. mays , which may be related to their larger genomes.

we also realized that certain factors could not be identified in individual species, namely sec <dig> , hrd <dig>  dfm <dig>  pex <dig> and pex <dig>  and others , which could be due to limitation of draft genomes for the respective plants. remarkably, pex <dig> could not be identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> analyzed genomes, while pex <dig> is not found in c. reinhardtii and p. patens. in addition, we observed that some components were encoded by an increasing number of genes across the groups and species, especially toc <dig>  toc <dig>  tic <dig>  srp <dig>  ubc <dig> and cdc <dig>  we also correlated the number of orthologues found in  <dig> plant species to the number of protein sequences for the translocation factors , which give hints for whole genome duplications and the conservation of the translocation factors in general.

it is evident that certain factors are represented by multiple orthologues . to explore the relationship between the different factors, we studied the sequences in more detail. at first, we determined the protein length based on the identified amino acid sequence , because the tomato genome consortium  reported a similar amino acid sequence length for ~43% of tomato proteins with their respective arabidopsis orthologues. in line with this notion, we found a good correlation pattern between amino acid length of the translocon components from tomato and arabidopsis .

further, we probed for predictable functional domains of the identified components . in cases where more than one domain was predicted, the order of the domains was automatically analyzed. for 77% of all proteins at least once the same domain architecture for an arabidopsis and a tomato protein in the same group of orthologues was observed. however, the domain architecture enabled us to assign one cpseca <dig> orthologue in arabidopsis  to solyc11g <dig> whereas the other orthologue at1g <dig>  could be similar to the combination of solyc11g <dig>  and solyc11g <dig> . thus, to prove the latter, we designed the forward primer from exonic region  of solyc11g <dig> and the reverse primer from exonic region  of solyc11g <dig>  we observed amplicon of ~400bp by rt-pcr on isolated rna  and by pcr on genomic dna . in the absence of the reverse transcriptase  or rna  no product is observed. thus, our results suggest that the two genes annotated represent a single gene .

nevertheless, after the two steps we still had  <dig> cases, where we could not clearly assign the orthologues from arabidopsis and orthologues from tomato to each other. thus, we applied additional strategies. first, we inspected publically available expression data to assign pairs of genes that are similarly regulated in both a. thaliana and tomato . however, the success was rather limited as the data density for tomato is not comparable to the one for a. thaliana. secondly, we compared the genomic region of the bait and the identified orthologue. for this, we analyzed the shared synteny for a region of seven genes up and downstream of the particular factor in arabidopsis and tomato . this approach assisted in the assignment of the tomato orthologues to specific arabidopsis genes. although for many of the factors the syntenic score appeared to be zero, some gene pairs that could be clearly assigned as orthologues via this analysis are indicated in .

the co-translational translocation system at the er membrane
in this pathway, the ribonucleoprotein complex annotated as signal recognition particle  binds to the hydrophobic region of the targeting signal of the emerging polypeptide. srp mediates targeting of the ribosome-nascent chain complex  to the membrane bound srp receptor 
 <cit>  composed of srα and the integral membrane protein srβ
 <cit> . the rnc is then transferred to the channel sec61
 <cit> . the transfer of the rnc to the sec <dig> complex is coupled with dissociation of srp-sr complex making the components available for a new round of protein translocation
 <cit> .

multiple orthologues are found for the srp components srp <dig> and srp <dig> in plants . while the putative srp <dig> proteins from tomato possess a comparable length and domain architecture to their arabidopsis counterparts, only one identified tomato srp <dig>  is comparable to the a. thaliana protein, while the tomato srp <dig> orthologue  does not contain the typical “srp <dig> domain”. for sec65p a single orthologue is detectable in tomato, which is longer than the a. thaliana orthologue, but both proteins are shorter than the corresponding protein in yeast. the receptor complex ‘srα/srβ’ is found in all plants as well.
 <cit> .  ta proteins are transferred to get <dig> in a sgt2/get4/get <dig> mediated manner. the get3-ta protein complex interacts with get1-get <dig> complex, the latter facilitating the release of ta protein into the membrane.  in the erad-l pathway, misfolded substrates are recognized by er-resident chaperones. this complex interacts with the luminal domain of hrd <dig>  the latter being complexed with the hrd1/der3
 <cit> . their substrates are translocated via sec <dig>  der <dig> or the e <dig> ligases. a complex of cytosolic e3-ligases  and e2-conjugating enzymes  ubiquitinate the substrates in the cytosol. hrd1/der <dig> interacts with der <dig> via usa <dig>  while dfm <dig> forms complexes with doa <dig>  hrd1/der <dig> and cdc <dig>  after ubiquitination, the substrates are pulled out by the aaa atpase machinery  and degraded by the 26s proteasome. note: the colour indicates the number of genes encoding the component. green: equal number of genes found in arabidopsis and tomato; blue: more genes in tomato than in a. thaliana; pink: less genes in tomato than in a. thaliana; yellow: no orthologues found in plants; red: only found in plants; purple: multiple subunits unified for better presentation; brown: not found in tomato; white: not included in our discussion.

for all other srp constituents, we did not find orthologues in any analyzed plant. however, by blast search analysis two genes similar to srp14p were identified in a. thaliana  and one in tomato . closer inspection revealed that at3g <dig> and solyc12g <dig> contain the “srp9- <dig> domain” and are orthologous to each other, while at2g <dig> contain the “srp <dig> domain”. thus, it might be speculated that one gene exists each for srp <dig> and srp <dig> in arabidopsis, while the tomato genome only encodes for srp <dig> 

the post-translational translocation system at the er membrane
in the post-translational pathway, preproteins are guided by chaperones to sec <dig> via a complex composed of sec62p, sec63p, sec71p and sec72p. we identified orthologues for sec <dig> and sec <dig> in all plants analyzed . one orthologue in a. thaliana and two in tomato are identified for sec <dig>  while sec <dig> has two orthologues in both plant species. as previously reported
 <cit> , we could not identify orthologues for sec <dig> and sec <dig>  which interact with chaperones via tetratricopeptide repeat  domains. however, sec <dig> might be replaced by the tpr containing er-protein attpr <dig> , which interacts with sec <dig> in a. thaliana <cit> .

the sec <dig> translocon in yeast is composed of sec61p, sbh1p and sss1p, or alternatively of ssh1p, sbh2p and sss1p
 <cit> . in a. thaliana we found three orthologues to all components except of ssh1p . in tomato we detected only two orthologues for sec61p and sbh1p/sbh2p, and none for sss1p. on the contrary, orthologues to sss1p were found in all other plant species. thus, we decided to use simple blast via which we identified a putative sss1p  in tomato. the protein contains the characteristic “sece domain”, while its sequence is about three times as long as the a. thaliana equivalents . further, we realized that sbh1p is absent from all the monocots except rice while sbh2p is encoded by the genomes of all the monocots suggesting redundancy in sec <dig> subunits . interestingly, from the ‘shared synteny’ analysis we could relate two orthologues of sec <dig> from tomato and arabidopsis together , whereas the third arabidopsis orthologue  may have originated from a recent duplication.

the translocation of tail-anchored proteins at the er membrane
proteins with single c-terminal transmembrane domain  proteins) are recognized by yeast sgt <dig> and transferred to the cytosolic get <dig> in a get4-get5-mediated manner 
 <cit> . the two membrane proteins get <dig> and get <dig> interact with the get3-ta protein complex and thereby mediate the ta protein release into the er membrane
 <cit> .

in plants, we identified sgt <dig>  get <dig> and get <dig>  in a. thaliana we found in general one orthologue, whereas we observed one orthologue of sgt <dig>  two of get <dig> and four of get <dig> in tomato. however, it has to be mentioned that one of the get <dig> orthologues in tomato  is significantly longer than the protein in a. thaliana and yeast and possess an additional “anion transporting atpase domain” beside the “pkinase domain”. moreover, from the shared syntenic analysis, we could correlate one of the orthologue of get <dig> from tomato  to the arabidopsis orthologue . interestingly, solanaceae family members were found to possess more genes for get <dig> than other plant species  additional file
 <dig> 

the er-associated degradation machinery
proteins having misfolded cytosolic, luminal or membrane-spanning domains are exported either by erad-c, erad-l and erad-m pathways, respectively 
 <cit> . erad-l substrates are first recognized by er-resident chaperones and subsequently translocated to the cytosolic face of the er membrane. for this process, sec61
 <cit> , derlins
 <cit>  and the e <dig> ligases
 <cit>  have been proposed as possible dislocases. during transfer, membrane bound ring-finger e3-ligases and e2-conjugating enzymes install ubiquitin moieties on the substrates. once ubiquitylated, these misfolded substrates are pulled by an aaa atpase complex , which further hands them over to the 26s proteasome for degradation
 <cit> .

for the erad-c, we identified tomato orthologues to the e <dig> ligase doa <dig> 
 <cit> , the e2-conjugating enzymes ubc <dig>  and ubc <dig> , but not to cue <dig>  which is thought to recruit ubc <dig> to the er membrane in yeast
 <cit> . from the shared syntenic analysis, we could correlate orthologues of doa <dig> in arabidopsis and tomato .

the described components of the erad-l and erad-m system are all present in plants with the exception of usa <dig>  which in yeast promotes the interaction between hrd1/der <dig> and der1
 <cit> . however, npl <dig> and ubx <dig> in arabidopsis have only been detected by literature search, but not by the defined pipeline. orthologues to npl <dig> from arabidopsis  are detectable in the genome of tomato , but not between npl <dig>  in yeast to other plant species. furthermore, we did not detect orthologues to ubx <dig>  in arabidopsis, although a functionally related protein  was previously described
 <cit> . no orthologue in arabidopsis was found for der <dig>  thus it might be that dfm1
 <cit>  and der <dig> function is performed by a single protein in plants, while in yeast der <dig> acts in the erad-l and erad-m path and its homologue dfm <dig>  in the erad-c path.

for hrd1/der3
 <cit>  that acts as e <dig> ligase in the erad-l and erad-m path, we identified two orthologues for  <dig> of the  <dig> plants , while the others possess either one or three orthologues. however, one of the a. thaliana proteins  is significantly shorter than the other proteins. we noticed that this hrd <dig> from a. thaliana showcases three splice variants, which differ in their amino acid lengths to a large extent . thus, the longest relates to the orthologues in yeast and tomato. for hdr <dig> and ufd <dig> we identified two/three orthologues in a. thaliana, but only one in tomato. from the syntenic scores, we suggest the two ufd <dig> orthologues  from arabidopsis corresponds to one gene in tomato . interestingly, plant species possess higher number of cdc <dig> genes , which may be accounted for its role in multiple processes .

the translocation system at the peroxisomal membrane
peroxisomal proteins are translocated across or inserted into the membrane by three distinct pathways
 <cit> .  some peroxisomal membrane proteins  with an n-terminal membrane-targeting signal  lacking the pex19-binding site
 <cit> .  type-ii pmps  with pex19-binding motif–containing mpts
 <cit>  are recognized by the cytosolic pex <dig>  which docks to pex <dig> while releasing the bound pmp into the membrane
 <cit> .  peroxisomal matrix proteins contain either a c-terminal  or n-terminal  targeting signal
 <cit> . the pts <dig> is recognized by the soluble receptor pex5
 <cit> , while pex <dig> is the receptor for the pts <dig> signal
 <cit> . the receptor-cargo complex is recognized at the peroxisomal membrane and is transferred into the peroxisomes through a ‘transient pore’ formed by pex <dig> together with its docking partner pex14
 <cit> , while the mechanism for pts <dig> cargos is yet to be deciphered. the re-export of pex <dig> into the cytosol requires ubiquitination by the aaa atpases pex <dig> and pex6
 <cit> .

we identified one orthologue each for the central receptors pex <dig> and pex <dig> in a.thaliana and tomato , while the two pex <dig> associated factors pex18p and pex21p described in yeast
 <cit>  could not be detected. moreover, pex <dig> was missing from the g.max genome whereas pex <dig> was absent from v. vinifera. the membrane bound docking complex composed of pex <dig>  pex <dig> and pex <dig> in yeast
 <cit>  has also been isolated in a.thaliana 
 <cit> . however, its components cannot be considered as orthologous to those from yeast . based on the a. thaliana sequences we identified one orthologue for pex <dig> and two orthologues of pex <dig> in tomato. one of the two pex <dig> orthologues in tomato  is  <dig> amino acids shorter than the other orthologue  but possess the same predicted “pex <dig> domain”. however, in solyc03g <dig> this domain is  <dig> amino acids shorter. interestingly, pex <dig> was absent from all the monocots considered in our study, which questions its central role as part of a potential translocation channel for pts <dig> containing proteins, a function which was proposed for the protein from leishmania donovani <cit> .
 <dig> 

all enzymes involved in mono- and polyubiquitination as well as in the export of pex <dig> exist in a. thaliana and tomato. this suggests that the same translocation mechanism exists in plants and yeast, which involves pex <dig> monoubiquitination after cargo delivery as prerequisite for its export to the cytosol. monoubiquitination is catalyzed by the ring-finger peroxin pex <dig> , and the e <dig> ligase pex12
 <cit> . in yeast, pex <dig> anchors pex <dig> to the peroxisomal membrane
 <cit> . from the defined pipeline, we could not identify pex <dig> orthologues, but the protein has previously been identified in a. thaliana <cit> , to which orthologues can be found in all other plant species except s. tuberosum.

in parallel, impaired pex <dig> recycling leads to its accumulation in the peroxisomes followed by degradation, which was designated as receptor accumulation and degradation  pathway
 <cit> . thereby, pex <dig> becomes polyubiquitinated by the e2-conjugating enzyme ubc <dig> or ubc <dig> and the e3-ubiquitin ligase pex <dig> or pex10
 <cit> , exported via pex1-pex <dig> and targeted to the proteasome, which all exist in plants.

remarkably, for pex <dig> which tethers the aaa atpases pex1/pex <dig> to the membrane
 <cit>  and which thus performs a similar function as pex <dig>  plant orthologues could not be identified as well, but the protein has also previously been identified in a. thaliana <cit> . as for pex <dig>  two pex <dig> orthologues have been recognized in tomato.

the transport of peroxisomal membrane proteins of type ii requires the action of pex <dig> and pex <dig>  for which we identified orthologues in plants . furthermore, from the shared synteny analysis, one of the pex <dig> orthologues from arabidopsis  related more to the only orthologue in tomato . closer inspection revealed that pex <dig> and pex <dig> are absent in c. reinhardtii and monocots have only one orthologue for pex <dig> and pex <dig> except z. mays, which possess two for pex <dig> .

the mitochondrial translocation system
most of the mitochondrial import pathways require the action of the tom complex localized in the outer membrane, which is composed of tom <dig>  tom <dig>  tom <dig>  tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig>  tom <dig> acts as an initial receptor for n-terminal presequences
 <cit> , which are then transferred to tom <dig>  the preprotein is translocated through the tom <dig> channel
 <cit> . tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig> are thought to modify the assembly and stability of the tom complex
 <cit> . the general importance of this translocon for the subsequent events might explain that all tom components are present in plants, considering that tom <dig> is replaced by om <dig> 
 <cit> . tom <dig> is involved in the recognition of inner membrane proteins delivered by hsp <dig> chaperones
 <cit> . on the contrary, pgap only predicted orthologues for tom <dig> in yeast  and arabidopsis , but these proteins have a “pb <dig> domain”, which adopts an ‘ubiquitin-like b-grasp structure’ that is involved in protein-protein interactions
 <cit>  comparable to the tpr folds typically found in tom <dig>  further, at1g <dig> was identified as cytosolic- localized clumped chloroplasts  <dig>  which is involved in chloroplast biogenesis
 <cit> . thus, the two identified proteins might have similar evolutionary roots, but do not represent functional equivalents.

tom <dig>  tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig> were not found by orthologue search, but by literature search
 <cit> . while  <dig> orthologues of tom <dig> have been described in arabidopsis, we could only detect  <dig> orthologues in tomato, while other plants also encode for the same in the range of 1– <dig> orthologues. for the other three factors we identified the same number of orthologues in tomato and arabidopsis. however, we could not detect any orthologue for tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig> in c.reinhardtii and m.truncatula whereas tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig> were absent from the genome of v.vinifera. tom <dig> and tom <dig> could be identified by the orthologue search and identical numbers  were identified in both plant genomes. we also identified the existence of tom <dig> in all other plants as well but with varied number of orthologues.

the preprotein transported by the tom complex and emerging in the intermembrane space  interacts with the tim <dig> complex , which consists of tim <dig>  tim <dig>  tim <dig> and tim <dig>  tim <dig> induces presequence-release from tom <dig> and tim <dig> acts as primary receptor in the ims
 <cit> . thereafter, the preprotein is translocated across the inner membrane through the tim <dig> channel
 <cit>  or laterally released from tim <dig> by the action of tim17
 <cit> . the import motor constituted by the matrix protein tim <dig>  the presequence translocase-associated motor components , and mthsp <dig> drives the translocation across the inner membrane
 <cit> .

all components of the tim <dig> complex can be identified. for tim <dig> and tim <dig> we found three and two orthologues in a. thaliana and tomato, respectively. remarkably, the genes identified for tim <dig> are in general  <dig> kda . one orthologue in tomato  has even only  <dig> amino acids and carries a “tim <dig> domain” that starts  <dig> amino acids prior to other orthologues, which might hint to a false annotation in the genome of tomato. for tim <dig> we identified at least one orthologue in yeast as well as all plant species discussed. while orthologues to yeast tim <dig> could not be detected, but
 <cit>  previously reported it in arabidopsis , with which we found orthologues in all other plant species.

the plant orthologues to the yeast components of the pam complex have been generally identified with the exception of pam <dig>  we report the existence of pam <dig> and mdj <dig> in the same orthology group with three orthologues. for pam <dig> and tim <dig> we observed distinct numbers of orthologues in the different plant species, but we could not identify tim <dig> orthologue for l. japonicus.

the tim <dig> complex composed of four subunits  is involved in the insertion of inner membrane proteins
 <cit> . the preproteins are transferred by the tiny tim proteins to the receptor tim <dig> and the channel-forming tim22
 <cit> . the precursor proteins are then laterally released from the tim <dig> channel into the inner membrane. while tim <dig> could be identified , tim <dig>  tim <dig> and tim <dig> were not found . the tiny tims functioning as ims chaperone for translocation can be identified in all plants, except the absence of tim <dig> from the genome of l.japonicus. from the shared synteny analysis, one of the tim <dig> orthologue from tomato  showed a clear affiliation to the only orthologue from arabidopsis.

inner membrane proteins are also inserted from the matrix side by the action of the oxa <dig> proteins. the pathway exists in plants as well, as two orthologues of oxa <dig> can be found in both, a. thaliana and tomato. however, one of the orthologues in tomato is rather small  and has a shorter “60kda inner membrane protein domain” characterizing the oxa <dig> protein family.

preproteins targeted to the ims contain conserved hydrophobic clefts and cysteine residues, which are recognized by mia <dig> leading to the formation of a disulfide bond in an erv <dig> dependent manner
 <cit> . the protein hot <dig> maintains mia <dig> in the zinc-free state to promote its oxidation by erv1
 <cit> . the complex seems to be conserved between plants and yeast, as the two essential components, mia <dig> and erv <dig> were identified in the genome of almost all plants analyzed here . only in the genome of c. reinhardtii we could not find mia <dig> 

the insertion of proteins into the outer mitochondrial membrane
outer membrane β-barrel proteins are translocated into the ims and guided by small tim chaperones tim9-tim <dig> and tim8-tim <dig> to the sam complex
 <cit> . this complex is composed of the omp85-like translocation pore. sam <dig>  the receptor sam <dig> and the gating factor sam37
 <cit> . in addition, mdm <dig> was discussed to collaborate with the sam for assembling tom <dig> and the receptor units of the tom complex
 <cit> . in contrast, the insertion of α-helical proteins depend on the action of mim <dig> but the molecular details of the complex and the mechanism remain to be established
 <cit> .

the plant sam complex is different from the one in yeast, as only sam <dig> could be identified. in general, one or two sam <dig> orthologues have been found in all plant species except in g.max . however, it is suggested that sam <dig> and sam <dig> are replaced by metaxin
 <cit> , which can be identified in all plant species. remarkably, we could not find a group of orthologues for mim <dig> in any of the analyzed plant species .

the translocation system in the chloroplast envelope membranes
the preproteins are recognized by the toc complex
 <cit> . toc <dig> recognizes hsp <dig> loaded with preproteins
 <cit> , while toc <dig> and toc <dig> bind to the precursor proteins and transfer them to the pore-forming unit, toc75
 <cit> . toc <dig> is also part of an ims complex with toc <dig>  an ims localized hsp <dig> and tic22
 <cit> . however, this complex is under debate
 <cit>  and thus, the process of preprotein transfer from the outer to the inner membrane translocon complex remains largely unknown.

logically, the analysis of the translocation system in chloroplasts is not based on a set from yeast but from a. thaliana. in a. thaliana, the toc <dig> family consists of four different genes: attoc <dig> , attoc <dig>  attoc <dig> and attoc <dig>  whereas our search for orthologues in tomato yielded five; two  of which could not be assigned to a specific family member . the latter orthologues in tomato contains two shorter duf <dig> domains, while the other  showed the same domain architecture as attoc <dig>  further, the orthologue of toc <dig>  has no “aig <dig> domain”. interestingly, toc <dig> is encoded by relatively higher number of genes in s. tuberosum , z. mays  and p. trichocarpa . toc <dig> has two orthologues in arabidopsis , and two orthologues have been found in tomato , both corresponding to attoc <dig>  the other receptor unit, toc <dig> has equal numbers of orthologues  in both a. thaliana and tomato. however, toc64-i and om <dig> are known not to be involved in protein translocation. in line, the c-terminal “tpr_ <dig> domain2” does not exist in all found plant orthologues. moreover, we observed a higher number of genes encoding toc <dig> in g. max  and p. trichocarpa .

the channel forming toc <dig> possess more orthologues in arabidopsis  than in tomato . remarkably, one of the arabidopsis orthologue  does not have the “surface antigen variable number repeat domain” whereas one tomato orthologue  possess the same domain twice. moreover, toc <dig> is encoded by one gene in arabidopsis and two in tomato, which otherwise is absent from monocots except s. bicolor.

in the inner membrane, tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> constitute the tic complex. at present, tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> are discussed as channel forming proteins for preprotein translocation
 <cit> , while tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> are assumed to regulate the translocon activity
 <cit> . the energy for the translocation is fuelled by stromal chaperones hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> and the co-chaperone tic40
 <cit> . the recently described sec system is composed of secy <dig> and seca2
 <cit>  and might be involved in integration or translocation of either stromal targeted or plastome encoded inner envelope proteins.

with exception of tic <dig>  all tic components have the same number of orthologues in both arabidopsis and tomato. tic <dig> possess  <dig> and tic <dig> has  <dig> orthologues in each of the two plants species. one of the sub-types, tic20-i has two orthologues  in arabidopsis and three in tomato . however, at1g <dig> has three different splice forms  and the longest isoform  extends over the neighboring gene . moreover it also contains a zinc finger-hit domain besides the characterizing tic <dig> domain whereas the tomato orthologue  carries only the zinc finger-hit domain and the other two orthologues have tic <dig> domains. we could not detect any orthologue for tic20-iv  in tomato. the search in other plant species depicted that tic <dig> is represented by higher numbers of genes in z. mays and g. max.

sec complexes exist in the thylakoid and inner envelope membrane, respectively. the inner envelope cpseca <dig> is represented by two genes in arabidopsis , and two in tomato .

the translocation system in the thylakoid membranes
proteins destined for thylakoid lumen are transported via cpsec and cptat pathways
 <cit> . twin-arginine translocon  substrates are recognized by hcf <dig> and cptatc. after formation, this complex recruits tha <dig>  and the hcf6-cptatc-tha <dig> forms the transient translocon
 <cit> . the second path is similar to the bacterial sec system, where cpseca binds to the signal sequence in the stroma and guides it through the cpsecye channel
 <cit> . thylakoid membrane proteins follow either spontaneous mechanism or require cpsrp for insertion. unlike the cytoplasmic srp complex, cpsrp has only two proteinaceous subunits - cpsrp <dig> and cpsrp43
 <cit> , which post-translationally transport light harvesting proteins 
 <cit> . the transport complex is recognized by the thylakoid membrane receptor cpftsy
 <cit> .

as expected, the complexes involved in import of proteins in or across the thylakoid membrane showcase a high degree of conservation. almost all components are encoded by one orthologue in both a. thaliana and s. lycopersicum. however, several components could not be identified in certain plant species, e.g. cpsece in tomato, v. vinifera and all monocots, cpsrp <dig> in v. vinifera or cpftsy in z.mays. closer inspection of the components revealed that cpsrp <dig> in tomato  carries an additional “chromo domain” in contrast to its arabidopsis orthologue additional file

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results clearly depict a higher overlap of arabidopsis translocation machineries with other plants than with yeast. however, all central components of the targeting and translocation machinery in the er- and peroxisomal membranes were identified. the complexity of the translocation systems in plants largely exceeds the one in yeast. for example, we identified more than one orthologue for 62% of all the factors in a. thaliana and 57% of all the factors in tomato. a similar picture can be drawn for the toc complex. on the contrary, most peroxins, tic and thylakoid translocon components are only encoded by a single gene, which suggests that the regulation of these translocation systems is manifested by transcriptional, translational or post-translational regulation rather than by orthologue-dependent functional diversification.

for mitochondria we can conclude that the different translocation systems exist, and that the pore forming proteins are largely conserved, while many assisting proteins like receptors or assembly factor are largely diverse and could only be identified on the base of the model system a. thaliana. however, the outer membrane protein insertion system of mitochondria appears to be distinct between plants and yeast.

during evolution, most of the plants had undergone lineage specific duplications – both before and after splitting from each other but in most cases the complexity in the translocation machinery seems to stay stable. this high architectural conservation of protein translocation in plants can be explained by the selective pressure as consequence of the importance of the process for cellular fate and by the large number of complex components interacting with each other. the split of the evolutionary branch leading to arabidopsis and tomato occurred after the whole genome duplication in a common ancestor approximately  <dig> myr ago. subsequently, arabidopsis had two additional lineage specific genome duplication events, whereas tomato and potato had a single genome triplication
 <cit> . this could be one reason for the different number of orthologues for specific factors.

thus, we provide evidence for an overall conservation of the translocation machinery and describe the inventory in  <dig> different plant species, which might guide future research of plant protein import.
