BACKGROUND
brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by microorganisms of the genus brucella that affects different livestock and wild animal species, besides man  <cit> . cattle are the preferred host of brucella abortus and the economic importance attributed to bovine brucellosis is based on losses caused by abortions, stillbirths, weight loss, decreased milk production and the establishment of sanitary barriers to international trade of animals and their products  <cit> .

because direct and indirect losses triggered by b. abortus infection, the control and eradication of bovine brucellosis is an important goal of several countries where the disease is endemic, including brazil that since  <dig> has a national program on the control and eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis   <cit> .

typing of brucella spp. by biovar determination and genotyping are important tools in a brucellosis control and eradication programs  <cit> . indeed, molecular typing methods are commonly used to investigate epidemiological relationships among isolates and sources of infection  <cit> . in this sense, the multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats  analysis  has proved to be an important tool in molecular epidemiology studies of brucellosis  <cit> , in the characterization of new brucella species  <cit>  and in the evaluation of sources of human infection  <cit> .

in mlva context, the assessment of the genetic stability is one of the vital elements to guarantee the successful use of this typing method, since it could confirm its ability to differentiate between two independent strains, while depicting relationships among strains from the same source  <cit> . the genetic stability can be deduced by typing results of multiple isolates originating from the same strain or strains after numerous passages  <cit> . in in vitro evaluations, b. abortus vaccine and field strains have been shown to be stable by mlva <dig>  <cit> . regarding to in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> markers, data based on b. abortus experimental infection showed only few changes in the hyper-variable loci  <cit> . whereas, mlva <dig> in vivo stability have not been evaluated under natural conditions.

therefore, the aims of this study were  to evaluate the genetic diversity of b. abortus isolates obtained from a single cattle brucellosis outbreak and  to investigate the in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> markers.

based on phenotypic characteristics, twenty four strains were classified as b. abortus biovar  <dig>  and thirteen as b. abortus biovar  <dig>  . all strains classified as b. abortus biovar  <dig> presented smooth colonial morphology. among the thirteen b. abortus biovar  <dig> strains, twelve exhibited rough colonial morphology and growth on tryptose agar plates supplemented with rifampicin  , whereas one strain isolated from a milk sample was classified as smooth brucella spp.

all strains were confirmed as belonging to the genus brucella by genus-specific pcr  <cit> , and as b. abortus by amos-enhanced pcr and bruce-ladder multiplex pcr  <cit> . moreover, the twelve isolates phenotypically classified as b. abortus biovar  <dig> rough strains were confirmed as rb <dig> vaccine strain by amos-enhanced pcr  <cit> .

the set of genetic markers which comprises the mlva <dig> was observed to be stable in vivo, even when evaluated from different clinical specimens over a 16 months outbreak. analysis of the mlva <dig> loci revealed three distinct genotypes among the  <dig> b. abortus strains isolated during the brucellosis outbreak, herein these genotypic patterns were labeled rb, w and z, for new genotypes the identification adopted was sequential in the same way used by minharro et al.  <cit>  . the genotype rb was observed in all twelve strains identified as b. abortus rb <dig>  which were all obtained from vaginal swab samples. the genotype w was observed in all twenty four isolates classified as b. abortus biovar  <dig> , while genotypic profile z was observed in only one strain, which was isolated from milk and identified as a smooth b. abortus biovar  <dig> field strain. this biovar  <dig> strain was isolated eleven months after confirmation of brucellosis in the herd on february/ <dig>  being one of the last strains isolated, since clinical samples were collected until may/ <dig> .

discussion
results from the present study on  <dig> b. abortus isolates from milk and vaginal swabs taken from  <dig> cows  during a 16 months period showed the in vivo genetic stability of the mlva <dig> markers. molecular typing methods are commonly used to investigate epidemiological relationships among isolates and sources of infection  <cit> . however, before being used for those purposes, pcr methods for molecular typing require careful in-house validation of typeability, reproducibility, repeatability, stability, discriminatory power and epidemiologic concordance  <cit> . the findings of this study, associated with previous data on the high discriminatory power and epidemiologic concordance of mlva <dig>  besides its good typeability and in vitro stability  <cit> , corroborate the use of mlva <dig> as suitable typing method for refining the understanding of the epidemiology of bovine brucellosis.

our results showed a low genetic diversity and the existence of three different b. abortus strains within a focus of bovine brucellosis, the rb <dig> vaccine strain , recovered from animals that were twice vaccinated in the period, and two field strains .

in the present study no rb <dig> was isolated from the milk of any animal during the post-partum period  but only from vaginal swabs, although some cows have been vaccinated in the last third of pregnancy and a highly sensitive diagnostic strategy have been employed  <cit> . these results were corroborated by previous studies that also reported no recovery of b. abortus rb <dig> from any of the milk sample tested by conventional bacteriological methods of cows vaccinated during pregnancy or 30– <dig> days after delivery  <cit> . regarding the presence of viable rb <dig> in postpartum vaginal secretion, it is important to consider that all animals from which rb <dig> were recovered after delivery were over 5 months of gestation by the time of revaccination with this strain and that no abortion was related to rb <dig> isolation . thus, it is likely that the rb <dig> booster had contributed to the recovery of the vaccine strain in postpartum period, since it has been observed that during transition period a depression in cell-mediated response occurs, which leads to a decrease of the resistance to disease or increase of the residual virulence of vaccines  <cit> .

other important finding of this study was the demonstration of viable b. abortus in milk from infected animals associated with the outbreak, corroborating the public health risk of the consumption of raw milk and unpasteurized dairy products  <cit> . the colonization of the mammary gland and associated lymph nodes by b. abortus with excretion of microorganisms in milk was already demonstrated  <cit> . in addition, it is important to emphasize that the methodologies used for bacterial culture and molecular identification were able to differentiate rb <dig> vaccine strain from b. abortus field strains.

interestingly, field strains isolated from this brucellosis outbreak showed distinct genotypes and biotypes, suggesting that the outbreak had two different sources of infection. the majority of b. abortus isolates from the outbreak  were classified as b. abortus biovar  <dig> genotype w, which remained the single cause of brucellosis in the herd for eleven months . this widely demonstrates that the introduction of this strain in the herd was responsible for the occurrence of the outbreak and consequently for the high abortion rate observed at the end of  <dig>  furthermore, in february  <dig>  the introduction into the herd of another field strain, b. abortus biovar  <dig> genotype z, was observed. this genotype z was confirmed by a twice repetition of mlva <dig> genotyping assay that showed the same results. there are two possible explanations for the presence of this infected animal, negative to the conventional serological tests adopted in the herd: first, this heifer was congenitally and persistently infected without seroconversion  <cit> , and second, the negative serological result from this infected heifer was a false negative result inherent to any diagnostic test. however, the diagnostic strategy employed was very sensitive  <cit> , which tends to minimized false negative results. since this second field strain was represented by just one isolate, it is very likely that the control policy adopted in the herd, which included test-and-removal procedures, has prevented the dissemination of this strain to other animals and consequently a new increase in the brucellosis prevalence levels into the herd.

besides the differences in the classification of biovar, the differences observed between the genotypes of the field strains were very large and not limited to differences in the more variable loci , but were also observed in conserved loci, such as bruce <dig> and bruce <dig> . therefore, the identification of the new source of infection in the herd was only possible due the use of mlva <dig>  otherwise the genotype z strain would have been considered just another b. abortus isolate within the outbreak.

epidemiological data of the herd also confirmed that the b abortus biovar  <dig> genotype z strain was a newly introduced strain in the farm, since the young heifer from which this strain was isolated was introduced in the herd shortly at the end of the outbreak . in fact, it has been widely demonstrated that the purchase of infected animals is the main risk factor for the introduction of brucellosis in free herds  <cit> . unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain more epidemiological data about the heifer from which the second b. abortus field strain was isolated, such as the brucellosis status of the herd of origin, which would have allowed a better understanding about the epidemiology of the genotype z strain.

the mlva <dig> panel  <dig> profiles of both b. abortus isolates, genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> by the mlvabank, have already been previously observed in minas gerais state  <cit> . moreover, the comparison between mlva <dig> genotypes of b. abortus biovar  <dig> field strain  and those previously described by minharro et al.  <cit>  revealed differences restricted to hypervariable loci , suggesting a possible epidemiological link between these strains, since all were isolated in the state of minas gerais and were also identified as biovar  <dig>  for the single field strain classified as genotype z, the comparison with mlva <dig> patterns previously described by minharro et al.  <cit>  showed a genetic distance of one locus  from a b. abortus biovar  <dig> also isolated from minas gerais state.

in a brucellosis control and eradication program the use of an accurate surveillance and highly discriminatory typing method is essential to characterize an outbreak and determine the source of infection and the transmission routes. the present results on typing multiple b. abortus isolates from an outbreak originated from an outbreak in the same herd depicted the in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> markers. the set of loci that comprise the mlva <dig> demonstrated to be very stable, even when assessed over the time span of one year and four months, since the field strain mainly responsible by the outbreak  and the rb <dig> vaccine strain recovered from vaccinated animals showed unchanged mlva <dig> profiles. these findings are extremely important because they definitely confirm the ability of the mlva <dig> to establish correct epidemiological correlations, since, besides having a high discriminatory power, mlva <dig> markers were also stable under natural selection pressure exerted by the host, during the sixteen months assessed. thus, these results increase the confidence in the traceback established from the results of mlva <dig> and further support this technique as the choice one for typing b. abortus.

futhermore, the examination of in vitro stability of the b. abortus rb <dig> vaccine strain, b. abortus strain  <dig> and b. abortus field isolates by serial passages in culture medium showed no change in mlva <dig> profile  <cit> . likewise, the analysis of b. abortus s <dig> vaccine strain from different batches of different manufacturers did not reveal significant differences in mlva <dig> pattern  <cit> . concerning the evaluation of in vivo genetic stability of mlva <dig> loci, it has also been demonstrated that passage of b. abortus rb <dig> in cattle and of b. abortus  <dig> in mouse did not lead to changes in any marker of mlva <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, minor changes in vntr pattern were observed in in vitro passages of b. abortus  <dig> and in genotyping of multiple b. abortus isolates from the same outbreak  <cit> . her et al.  <cit>  found different allelic profiles in seven of twenty-three herds in which more than one b. abortus isolates were obtained. those different genotypes from same outbreak showed mutations only in the loci bruce  <dig> and  <dig>  which did not seem to affect the identification of a possible common origin of the strains  <cit> . however, our data showing the high in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> loci have as main findings over previous data the large numbers of isolates  obtained from the same source, the long period of time assessed  and the typing of strains colonizing different sites , and therefore under different selective environmental pressures.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study on typing of multiple isolates from different clinical specimens originating from the same outbreak over a sixteen month period indicate the in vivo stability of the mlva <dig> markers, a low genetic diversity among b. abortus isolates and the usefulness of mlva <dig> for epidemiological studies of bovine brucellosis.
