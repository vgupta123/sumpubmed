BACKGROUND
expansion of transcription factor  families via gene duplication enables an organism to adapt to new environments by providing a means to rewire its gene regulatory network  <cit> . the process of rewiring is accomplished through natural selection of random mutations that maneuver each tf homolog into a distinct niche. mutations that alter the set of target genes regulated by a tf can lead to functionally different effects. this process of functional divergence has two primary outcomes: 1) neo-functionalization where a tf gains a new function not present in the ancestral tf, and 2) sub-functionalization where the homologous tfs divide the functions of the ancestral tf  <cit> . mutations that change the context where tf homologs are expressed can also be very important as they can relocate an advantageous function to a new context  <cit> . this complementary process of contextual divergence also has two primary outcomes: 1) neo-contextualization can bring an advantageous function to a new context, and 2) sub-contextualization where tf homologs split up the contexts of the ancestral tf  <cit> . thus, mutations causing functional and contextual divergence of duplicated tfs allow organisms to explore a large space of new environmental or nutritional niches. interestingly, homologs that are co-expressed in a particular context tend to have divergent dna recognition motifs  and homologs expressed in different contexts often retain similar dna recognition motifs   <cit> . thus, through tf duplication followed by functional and contextual divergence an organism can rewire its gene regulatory network to deal with new nutritional and environmental challenges.

feast/famine regulatory proteins   <cit>  or lrp-like proteins  <cit>  of the lrp/asnc family  represent one of the oldest and largest families of prokaryotic transcriptional regulators. this ancient family of tfs is found both in archaea and bacteria suggesting that their common ancestor had at least one ffrp-like protein  <cit> . it is striking that on average each sequenced archaeal genome encodes  <dig>  ffrps, which suggests that expansions in the ffrp family had already occurred in a common ancestor . for instance, in the archaeal family of halobacteriaceae ffrp expansions have led to an average of  <dig>  ffrp homologs per sequenced genome. thus, it is safe to assume that the ffrp gene family has evolved through numerous expansions prior to and after evolution of the archaeal lineage  <cit>  and that these expansions provide one possible means for organisms to adapt to changes in nutritional and/or environmental conditions  <cit> .

our research focuses on the genome of h. salinarum nrc- <dig> from the halobacteriaceae family, which encodes eight full-length ffrp homologs as well as an additional putative ffrp homolog that is missing a dna binding domain   <cit> . structurally ffrp proteins are comprised of a helix-turn-helix  dna binding domain connected through a flexible linker to a “regulation of amino acid metabolism”  domain that typically binds amino acids to modulate regulatory activity  <cit> . ram domains in some ffrps have strong specificity for a single amino acid  <cit> , some are activated by two or more amino acids  <cit> , and others have evolved specificity to non-amino acid effector molecules  <cit> . the presence of a trka-c domain  <cit>  in trh <dig> and a trash domain  <cit>  in vng1179c suggest these ffrps may be involved in the sensing and regulation of genes in response to changes in k+/nad + and metals   <cit> ), respectively . however, the contexts in which the eight ffrps act and the specific genes they regulate are largely unknown. this information is essential to understand how the eight ffrp family members in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> have functionally and contextually diverged.

here we have characterized the functional and contextual divergence of expanded ffrp family members in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> to understand how tf homologs evolve to occupy different niches. the key features defining an ffrp’s niche are the repertoire of target genes that it regulates, the contexts in which it is expressed, and the effector molecules that modify its activity. we experimentally mapped genome-wide binding locations for all eight ffrps, analyzed their expression across  <dig> gene expression microarrays from  <dig> different growth conditions which mimic environmental and nutritional contexts h. salinarum nrc- <dig> is likely to experience in the wild, and inferred their effector-molecule preferences. this integrated analysis provided evidence for both functional and contextual divergence in the evolution of distinct conditionally active regulatory networks for five of the eight ffrps. we have performed follow-up experiments that validate conditional regulation by two ffrps, and demonstrate a context dependent fitness benefit for the regulation. our results demonstrate that the eight ffrps in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> have evolved to occupy distinct niches through variations in one or all of the three known determinants of their functions: which genes they regulate, when they are expressed, and what effector-molecules they bind. importantly, these results illustrate how interrelated variations in these three properties tune function of each ffrp to the environmental context in which it acts.

RESULTS
evolution of homologous ffrps in h. salinarum nrc-1
duplication events leading to eight full length homologous ffrps in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> , trh <dig> , trh <dig> , trh <dig> , trh <dig> , trh <dig> , vng1179c, and vng1237c) occurred long before h. salinarum nrc- <dig> diverged from other phylogenetically related archaea. this assertion is supported by the fact that on average sequenced archaeal genomes have 5 ±  <dig> ffrp homologs suggesting that progenitors for many of the ffrps in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> were likely present in a common ancestor of most archaeal lineages. given this amount of time, it is likely that evolutionary processes would generate observable amounts of functional and contextual divergence between the homologous h. salinarum nrc- <dig> ffrps. additionally, the observation that the halobacteriaceae family, that includes h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  has an average of 10 ±  <dig> ffrp homologs, which demonstrates that recent expansions of ffrps have occurred within this family. an excellent example of recent expansions within halobacteriaceae and of functional divergence between ffrp homologs is the fusion of new functional domains trka-c and trash to trh <dig> and vng1179c, respectively. the fusion of trka-c is restricted to the halobacteriaceae  and fusion of the trash domain is restricted to the phyla crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota . we then hypothesized that less obvious functional divergence may be observed by analyzing mutations accrued in protein coding sequences. functional divergence of gene family members at the protein level can be quantified as changes in conservation at specific residues between an ffrp and its related homologs compared to another ffrp and its related homologs . we applied this approach to full length protein sequences to estimate the pairwise coefficient of functional divergence  between all ffrps. we found that each ffrp had significant evidence for functional divergence from every other ffrp . through these evolutionary analyses, we have provided evidence that some of the ffrps in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> are as old as the archaeal lineage and that there have been recent expansions within the halobacteriaceae family. we also provide evidence that each ffrp has significantly functionally diverged at the protein sequence level, and in subsequent sections we will explore the implications of this sequence level divergence on the function of each ffrp.table  <dig>

genome-wide binding locations of feast/famine regulatory proteins 
we then mapped the genomic binding locations of all eight ffrps from h. salinarum nrc- <dig> to understand how the homologous tfs might have diverged to perform different functions. each ffrp was over-expressed with an epitope tag, chromatin immunoprecipitation  was performed, and its genome-wide binding locations were mapped by tiling microarray hybridization . the over-expression of the epitope tagged ffrps allows the identification of an ffrp’s binding sites independent of the condition in which the chip-chip study was performed. the genomic distribution of ffrp binding sites between intergenic and genic sequences  was equivalent to the fraction of intergenic and coding sequences in the genome . the eight ffrps were found to regulate between  <dig> and  <dig> genes whose promoters harbor their experimentally mapped binding sites . the dna-binding map revealed that approximately 30% of all genes  in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> were putatively regulated by one or more ffrps. interestingly, nearly half of these genes  had at least two ffrp binding sites in their promoter region, generating a highly overlapping set of interactions. the high degree of overlap between ffrp target genes could be explained by similarity of ffrp dna recognition motifs  <cit>  and/or formation of hetero-oligomeric structures  <cit> .

evidence of functional divergence between ffrps
the dna binding domain  of the ffrp protein is a key factor in selecting the genes they modulate. we performed pairwise sequence analysis and detected significant evidence for functional divergence of the dbds of many ffrps . we converted the functional divergence measure into a distance metric, which we subsequently used to cluster and discover how the ffrp dbds are related to each other . despite the functional divergence in dbd, there was significant pairwise similarity in the promoters bound by six of the eight ffrps . significant similarity in ffrp binding sites has also been observed between lrpb and lysm in s. solfataricus  <cit> . it is important to note that even with the significant pairwise similarity in promoter binding there were pairwise differences in promoter binding on the order of  <dig> to 100% between all ffrps. the known ability of ffrps to hetero-oligomerize is one possible explanation for the significant similarity in their dna-binding locations  <cit> . we also investigated whether these similarities and differences across dna-binding maps of the ffrps could be explained by a corresponding similarity or variation in their dna recognition motifs. the putative ffrp dna recognition motifs  were remarkably similar to the degenerate a/t-rich core motifs that have been characterized for other ffrps   <cit> . the motifs determined by analysis of genome-wide binding locations of the h. salinarum nrc- <dig> ffrps also contained a highly conserved and functionally important cg present in the motifs of lrpb and lysm from s. solfataricus  <cit> . notably, dna recognition motifs of three ffrps  were significantly similar  to characterized binding motifs for at least one of the ffrp orthologs   <cit> . we observed significant pair-wise similarities between dna recognition motifs for five ffrps . interestingly, trh <dig> and vng1179c which have additional functional domains do not show significant overlap of target genes with other ffrps nor do they have similar dna recognition motifs. this could be evidence that the additional domains interfere with ram domain mediated hetero-oligomerization which alters their function. notwithstanding the overall similarity, subtle variations in the consensus recognition sequence motifs seem to be important as they extended regulation by each ffrp to additional unique sets of genes. for instance, consistent with functions regulated by ffrps in other organisms  <cit> , asnc, vng1237c and trh <dig> were all implicated in regulation of genes with translation-associated functions, but only vng1237c was also implicated in regulation of ‘atp synthesis coupled proton transport’ . thus, our data demonstrate functional divergence through subtle variations that have resulted in at least three dna recognition motifs for the eight homologous ffrps.figure  <dig>

evidence of contextual divergence of ffrps
one plausible explanation for the evolutionary retention of two or more ffrps with similar target genes is that they might contribute to fitness in different contexts or respond to different effector molecules. we looked for evidence of contextual divergence by comparing the expression patterns and putative effector molecule dependencies of the eight ffrps.

first, we computed pairwise expression correlations of the eight ffrps across a compendium of  <dig> transcriptome profiles of h. salinarum nrc- <dig> from  <dig> different growth conditions   <cit> . interestingly, five ffrps  that putatively regulate different sets of genes had similar expression patterns . by contrast, with the exception of trh <dig> and vng1237c, the expression patterns of ffrps that regulate similar sets of genes  were not correlated .

second, we observed significant evidence for functional divergence between the ram domains of many ffrps . again, we converted this functional divergence measure into a distance metric and used it to analyze relationships of the ram domains of the  <dig> ffrps . this led to targeted analysis of key residues in the ram domain  <cit> , which further enabled the discovery of the most likely effector molecules for each of the five ffrps . the additional trka-c domain  <cit>  in trh <dig> and the trash domain  <cit>  in vng1179c suggested that these ffrps might regulate genes in response to changes in k+/nad+ and metal ions   <cit> ), respectively . impressively, the structure of functional distance between ffrp ram domains parses the ffrps into clusters that explain their effector molecule preferences . firstly, functional distance grouped together trh <dig> and trh <dig> and predicted that they have similar preferences for arg, gln, and lys. similarly, trh <dig>  trh <dig>  trh <dig> and trh <dig> were predicted to share a preference for polar amino acids. by contrast, asnc and vng1237c are most likely modulated by nonpolar amino acids. finally, the co-clustering of trh <dig> and vng1179c is most likely because they are most diverged and their ram domains are likely non-functional. instead, their effector molecule preferences originate from the fused domains  for trh <dig>  and cu2+  for vng1179c). thus, the responsiveness to different effector molecules explains how ffrps that regulate a similar set of genes or have similar expression patterns across  <dig> environmental contexts  might have sub- or neo-contextualized .

ffrps evolved into distinct roles through both functional and contextual divergence
altogether, the evidence for functional and contextual divergence demonstrates that no two ffrps are similar in all respects . vng1179c and trh <dig> provide an excellent example of functional and contextual divergence. the two ffrps are highly co-expressed  but have functionally diverged because of variations in their binding motifs , and their functions are further contextualized by their differential responsiveness to k+  and cu . on the other hand, trh <dig> and trh <dig>  have very similar dna recognition motifs, similar preference for effector molecules , but have contextually diverged through differential expression across environments . thus, the eight ffrps in h. salinarum nrc- <dig> have evolved to take on distinct roles based on who they regulate , when they are expressed , or which effector molecules modulate their activity .

context dependent regulation of ffrp target genes
while we expected that over-expression of an ffrp would reveal the most comprehensive set of binding sites, we also expected that only a subset of these binding sites would be conditionally functional in any given environment. we predicted that the context in which expression of an ffrp is significantly correlated to subsets of its target genes would provide the means to identify conditionally functional binding-sites of each ffrp. we investigated patterns of correlations between each ffrp and its target genes across  <dig> environmental contexts, described above. we restricted our analyses to only those conditions in which expression level of the ffrp changed appreciably . because ffrps can function as activators  <cit>  or repressors  <cit>  we tested for both positive and negative correlation between expression changes of an ffrp and its target genes. three of the eight ffrps were significantly correlated or anti-correlated to subsets of their target genes across diverse environmental contexts . based on this analysis, three ffrps  were predicted to function as conditional activators , while vng1237c appears to also function as a conditional repressor for a different set of conditions . this analysis also revealed specific experimental design parameters  to further characterize the predicted functions of ffrps.figure  <dig>

conditional activation of  <dig> genes by asnc contributes to fitness in sub-inhibitory levels of paraquat
transcript levels of both asnc and  <dig> of its  <dig> target genes decreased in response to a sub-lethal dose of the reactive oxygen species generating agent paraquat  and were restored upon removal of pq   <cit> . our prediction was that differential regulation of these  <dig> genes by asnc was important for oxidative stress management upon exposure to pq  . we tested this hypothesis by monitoring transcript level changes of the  <dig> genes in the ∆asnc strain at  <dig> and 160 minutes post-addition of 4 mm pq . we observed significant reduction  in activation of the  <dig> genes in the ∆ura <dig> ∆asnc strain at 1 minute relative to 160 minutes post-addition of 4 mm pq, validating that asnc activates these genes early and addition of pq turns this activation off . impressively, ∆ura <dig> ∆asnc also had a pq-dependent growth-defect , demonstrating the physiological importance of this conditional regulation of specific genes by asnc in the presence of pq.figure  <dig>

conditional repression of  <dig> genes by vng1237c is important for normal growth
we also performed experiments to test the predicted role of vng1237c in repressing  <dig> out of its  <dig> target genes as cell density increased during growth in batch culture  <cit>  . consistent with this prediction we observed that deletion of vng1237c resulted in a significant loss of repression  of the  <dig> genes during growth . interestingly, the poor growth characteristics of the ∆ura <dig> ∆vng1237c strain suggested that this conditional regulation of  <dig> genes by vng1237c has physiological relevance . we performed additional control experiments with all ffrp deletion strains to rule out that this might be a general growth defect for all ffrp deletion strains. these experiments confirmed that the growth defect was specific to the deletion of vng1237c  .figure  <dig> 
vng1237c acts as a repressor of  <dig> genes during growth in batch culture. a. and b. expression of vng1237c  and the median expression of its  <dig> target genes  for two biological replicates  are strongly anti-correlated across the growth curve as measured through optical density at 600 nm   <cit> . red arrows indicate the sampling od600s of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  used for microarray validations. c. distribution of correlation coefficients for all  <dig>  genes on the bottom , all  <dig>  genes in growth curve conditions ,  <dig> vng1237c target genes in the growth curve conditions  and the  <dig> anti-correlated vng1237c target genes in the growth curve conditions . red dashed line indicates median correlation coefficient of  <dig> vng1237c target genes in the growth curve conditions used as a cutoff to discover  <dig> correlated vng1237c target genes. d. relative repression is significantly higher for the  <dig> vng1237c target genes between ∆ura <dig> ∆vng1237c and ∆ura <dig> control strain . ‘*’ means wilcoxon rank-sum test p-value ≤ <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate how divergence across regulators of the ffrp family has rewired the h. salinarum nrc- <dig> gene regulatory network to differentially regulate genes and bring physiologically relevant functions to specific environmental conditions. the specialization of each ffrp function is a product of changes to three properties: 1) variations in the dna-binding domain, which determine which promoters it binds; 2) promoter variations, which determine when it is expressed; and 3) variations in the ram domain or fusion to an entirely different ligand-binding domain, which alters specificity for effector-molecules to determine when it is post-translationally activated or inactivated. we demonstrated significant functional divergence was present at the protein sequence level between each ffrp. thus it is not surprising that none of the ffrps are alike in all three respects, because variations in one or more of these three key properties has potentially given each a unique and physiologically relevant capability, such pq-responsive regulation by asnc and growth-specific regulation by vng1237c. there was significant overlap between the set of genes that were conditionally regulated by asnc and vng1237c . in addition to regulating a common set of core functions such as ribosomes, translation factors, atp synthase, and cobalamin biosynthesis, the two ffrps also regulated few unique genes, such as dna repair enzymes  and a na+/h + antiporter complex . yet, conditional regulation of similar genes by the two ffrps had distinct environment-specific consequences, demonstrating how contextual and functional divergence of ffrps has physiologically important consequences for fitness of h. salinarum nrc- <dig> under routine and stressful conditions.

early work on the mechanisms by which tfs diverge into unique roles focused primarily on variation at the level of dna recognition motif, i.e. functional divergence  <cit> . more recent work has shown that variation in the promoters of tfs altering the contexts in which they are expressed is also important, i.e. contextual divergence  <cit> . our work demonstrates that contextual divergence can also arise from variation in ligand binding domains that result in preference for different effector molecules. interestingly, variations in these three properties were interrelated in that divergence in one excludes the need for divergence in the other two but they are not directly predictive of each other. as was observed previously for human tf homologs  <cit> , there is no correlation between pairwise similarity of expression and similarity of dna recognition motifs across all ffrps . by integrating across the different levels of divergence it was possible to come up with specific predictions about physiologically relevant conditional regulation of ffrp target genes. for instance, asnc was down-regulated in response to pq treatment, and the down-regulation of its target genes in this context ultimately influenced the fitness of h. salinarum under oxidative stress conditions. similarly, vng1237c was up-regulated during growth, it was active during growth, and the repression of its target genes was important for wild type growth characteristics. these interrelationships underlie the success and power of our strategy of integrating binding and gene expression data to elucidate conditional regulation by each member of this expanded ffrp family of regulators. specifically, by over-expressing a tagged tf we were able to generate comprehensive dna-binding maps in a relatively context independent manner. the assessment of correlation between transcriptional changes of the ffrp and its target genes revealed the subset of binding events that were conditionally functional in specific environmental contexts. this is a generic strategy that can readily be applied to elucidate conditionally active gene regulatory networks in any organism, just from a map of genome-wide tf-dna binding locations and a compendium of transcriptome profiles from diverse environments. future studies employing chip-exo  <cit>  will enhance this generic strategy by improving the resolution of ffrp binding events which makes the discovery of ffrp target genes and motifs more straightforward.

while we had some success in identifying the effector molecules for each ffrp homolog, these predictions will have to be experimentally verified  <cit> . recent studies in a closely related species h. salinarum r <dig> validated the preference of trh <dig> for glutamine and determined that the novel effector molecule binding residues of trh <dig> indicate a preference for aspartic acid  <cit> . the preferences, specificity, and affinity for effector molecules, and how they influence the activity of an ffrp are critical pieces of information as they will shed insight into how an organism senses and responds to dynamic intra-cellular and external environmental changes. the systems level integration and coordination of varied functions of expanded ffrps, as well as of all other regulators will ultimately reveal how variations in the promoter, dna-binding domain and effector-molecule recognition in an ffrp co-evolve to generate novel coordination of different cellular processes that is better suited for the new environment.
