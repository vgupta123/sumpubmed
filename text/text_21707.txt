BACKGROUND
dna-binding domains/proteins are functional proteins in a cell, which plays a vital role in various essential biological activities, such as dna transcription, replication, packaging, repair and rearrangement  <cit> . in past, numerous computational methods predict dna-binding domains/proteins using informative features from protein structure and amino acid sequence. the structure-based prediction methods such as  <cit>  are accurate, but not capable for high throughput annotation. in this study, the sequence-based prediction methods for dna-binding domains/proteins are investigated.

the computational methods using support vector machine  in conjunction with evolutionary information of amino acid sequence in terms of their position-specific scoring matrices  for predicting dna-binding sites were successfully developed  <cit> . several methods of using machine learning approaches were developed to predict dna-binding domains/proteins from given sequences of variable lengths  <cit> , shown in table  <dig> 

pcp: physicochemical property and biochemical property

*: a small number  of feature vectors selected from  <dig> vectors

#: the averaged value of amino acids in a sequence for one property

due to different design aims and data sets used, it is difficult to assess which feature type is the most informative cooperated with svm by comparing with prediction accuracies only. the pssm profile was first used with svm to successfully predict dna-binding domains and proteins from query amino acid sequences in the method pssm- <dig>  <cit> . the pssm is an effective feature type of representing dna-binding sequences, but its ability of interpretability is not satisfactory enough in analyzing the binding mechanism. besides pssms, physicochemical properties with characteristics of high interpretability were commonly used  <cit> . some issues are concerned in designing prediction methods, described below.

1) selection of physicochemical properties. generally, effective physicochemical properties of amino acids are selected as prediction features by using known properties of dna-binding mechanism and binding knowledge  <cit> . however, it is desirable to explore undiscovered properties by machine learning approaches to further advance prediction accuracy and understand the binding mechanism.

2) representation of sequences. how to effectively represent sequences of variable lengths as a feature vector using physicochemical properties plays an important role in advancing prediction accuracy. the pseudo-amino acid composition is an efficient representation method of coupling physicochemical properties, which was used to represent a sequence as a 40-dimensional feature vector for discriminating dna-binding from non-binding proteins  <cit> . the combined descriptor was proposed using amino acid composition and a series of associated physicochemical properties to form a 132-dimensional feature vector  <cit> . the conjoint triad descriptor of using a 343-dimensional feature vector was proposed that  <dig> amino acids were clustered into seven classes according to their dipoles and volumes of side chains  <cit> .

3) values of amino acids for specific physicochemical properties. the aaindex database  <cit>  collected  <dig> physicochemical and biochemical properties  with corresponding values of amino acids. how to select an effective feature vector of  <dig> amino acid values to represent a given property by using experience of designers is not straightforward. recently, some computational methods of predicting protein functions were successfully developed by mining informative physicochemical properties with their corresponding values from aaindex  <cit> .

4) tradeoffs between prediction accuracy and knowledge acquisition. besides pursuit of high prediction accuracy, discovering potential properties to further understand the binding mechanism should be also taken into account. although ensemble classifiers with hybrid feature types and boosting techniques are commonly used to improve prediction performance, it is more desirable to find effective, interpretable physicochemical properties with strong discrimination abilities under using a simple svm classifier.

this study presents a troublesome problem in using the aaindex database and proposes an effective method to solve. we found that some different physicochemical properties have similar vectors of representing  <dig> amino acids and some closely related physicochemical properties have dissimilar vectors. for example, several dissimilar vectors in aaindex are available in coupling the hydrophobicity property to represent a sequence and their corresponding performance is significantly different. similarly, if a different property with a similar vector replaces the known one without significantly degrading prediction performance, it means that the replaced property may be also relative to the binding mechanism from the viewpoint of machine learning. the detailed explanation by using a real quantization example is described below.

for the aim of designing accurate prediction methods, the major concern is to identify feature vectors with high discrimination abilities for classifying positive and negative samples. this task can be done well for computational methods by using an optimization approach to feature selection from a large set of candidate features. if the feature vectors were identified by predetermined properties based on prior knowledge, the selected vectors of representing amino acids may be not the best. considering the other aim of discovering potential properties to further look insight the binding mechanism, we propose a systematic, optimization approach  to automatically identify a set of feature vectors and analyze the feature vectors to find properties of affecting the dna-binding mechanism.

the proposed approach auto-idpcps can identify a small number m of feature vectors cooperated with a single svm classifier, and discover the related hydrophobicity properties with comparable performance, compared with the pssm feature. auto-idpcps would help designers to investigate informative physicochemical and biochemical properties by considering both prediction accuracy and analysis of binding mechanism simultaneously. auto-idpcps can be also applicable to predict and analyze other protein functions from sequences.

methods
the flowchart of the proposed approach auto-idpcps is shown in fig.  <dig>  the input of the method comprises the aaindex database and three data sets, including dna-binding domains and sequences, and one independent test data set. the output has two parts: 1) a predictor for dna-binding domains/proteins with a set of m informative feature vectors and the parameter setting of svm by using an efficient feature selection algorithm ibcga, and 2) an analyzer with a set of promising physicochemical and biochemical properties in the aaindex database for analyzing the dna-binding mechanism.

data sets
to evaluate effectiveness of the identified physicochemical properties by comparing with the famous pssm features, we used the benchmark data sets used in the pssm- <dig> method  <cit> , as shown in table  <dig>  the data set dnaset has  <dig> non-redundant dna-binding domains  and  <dig> non-binding domains. no two domains have similarity more than 25%. the data set dnaaset consists of  <dig> dna-binding proteins and  <dig> non-binding proteins. no two proteins have similarity more than 25%. an independent data set dnaiset is additionally used, having  <dig> dna-binding domains and  <dig> non-dna-binding proteins  <cit> .

feature vector representation
all the domains/sequences have a variable length l. a sequence forms an l-dimensional profile where the value of each amino acid is obtained from the aaindex database for encoding a specific physicochemical property. the l-dimensional profiles are transformed into vectors with the same constant length l for utilizing svm. the transformation can be any known effective representation provided that the l features can effectively classify the l-dimensional profiles of positive and negative sequences. the simplest feature is the mean of the profile that l= <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the sequences with m properties are represented as an m-dimensional feature vectors. finally, all values of the feature vectors are normalized into  to apply svm.

feature selection by ibcga
selecting a minimal number of informative features while maximizing prediction accuracy is a bi-objective 0/ <dig> combinatorial optimization problem. an efficient inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm ibcga  <cit>  bases on an intelligent genetic algorithm iga  <cit>  is utilized to solve this optimization problem. iga based on orthogonal experimental design uses a divide-and-conquer strategy and a systematic reasoning method instead of the conventional generate-and-go method to efficiently solve the combinatorial optimization problem c having a huge search space of size n!/!)), where n= <dig> in this study. ibcga can efficiently search the space of c by inheriting a good solution in the space of c  <cit> . therefore, ibcga can economically obtain a complete set of high-quality solutions in a single run.

the chromosome encoding scheme of iga consists of n binary iga-genes gi for selecting informative features  and two 4-bit iga-genes for encoding γ and c of svm parameters, where γ∈{2- <dig>  2-6…, 28} and c∈{2- <dig>  2-6…, 28}  <cit> . the ith feature is used in the svm classifier if gi=1; otherwise, the ith feature is excluded . the performance of selected properties associated with the parameter values of svm is measured by five-fold cross-validation  for comparing with the method pssm- <dig>  <cit> . ibcga with the fitness function f of 5-cv prediction accuracy can simultaneously obtain a set of solutions, xr, where r=rstart, rstart+ <dig>  …, rend in a single run. in this study, the parameter settings rstart = <dig>  rend = <dig>  npop = <dig>  pc = <dig> , and pm = <dig> . the output contains a set of m selected properties from aaindex and an svm classifier with associated parameter settings γ and c. the customized ibcga algorithm used in auto-idpcps is given below.









the procedure appscore is described as follows:

step 1: calculate the appearance frequency f of each feature pi from all features in the r sets, where i= <dig>  …, mt. there are mÂ¬t features in the t-th set.

step 2: calculate score st,t= <dig>  …, r for each of r solutions:   

clustering properties by fuzzy c-means
the physicochemical properties can be classified into six groups according to their biological meanings  <cit> . from the viewpoint of machine learning, two properties are similar if the distance between their feature vectors is small. to identify informative physicochemical properties and obtain effective feature vectors with strong discriminative abilities, we cluster the  <dig> vectors of physicochemical properties into  <dig> clusters using a fuzzy c-means  method  <cit> .

a feature vector of amino acids is a set of  <dig> numerical values representing a physicochemical property of amino acids. to apply the fcm method, all data were normalized in such a way that every physicochemical property had an averaged profile value of zero and a standard deviation equal to  <dig>  the fcm method has an objective functional of the form  <cit> :   

where n= <dig> is the number of data vectors, k is the number of clusters to be found, uij∈ <cit>  is the membership degree of jth data vector xj in the ith cluster, the ith cluster represented by the cluster prototype vi, s∈[ <dig> ∞) is a weighting exponent called the fuzzifier and d is the distance of xj from the cluster prototype vi. dembélé and kastner  <cit>  suggested the parameters setting s= <dig>  and k= <dig> clusters, adopted in this study.

identifying physicochemical properties
it is not easy to discover related physicochemical properties for analyzing dna-binding mechanism by computational methods using relatively small-size data sets. therefore, we present a hybrid method by combining evidences from the viewpoints of both machine learning and biological meanings. auto-idpcps identifies m properties belong to c out of  <dig> clusters. we examine each property p <dig> of the  <dig> properties and each property p <dig> of the identified m properties. if they satisfy the following two criteria, p <dig> is a promising property to be further investigated: 1) the distance between the feature vectors of p <dig> and p <dig> is small, and 2) p <dig> is replaced with p <dig> one at a time and the prediction accuracy is not significantly decreased.

only  <dig> of  <dig> properties were classified into six groups  <cit> , : alpha and turn propensities, : beta propensity, : composition, : hydrophobicity, : physicochemical properties, and : other properties. we classified the other  <dig> properties into the six groups according to their distances of vectors using a nearest-neighbour rule. the  <dig> featured ids and their corresponding aaindex ids are listed in table s <dig> . the  <dig> clusters and their corresponding physicochemical and biochemical properties belonging to six groups in the aaindex database are given in table  <dig>  the statistical result of the  <dig> physicochemical properties distributed upon the  <dig> clusters and six groups is given in table  <dig>  the large clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have properties belonging to six groups. the valuable information in tables  <dig> and  <dig> integrating classification results of both biological meanings and similarity measure is very helpful in identifying informative properties. the statistical results of property distribution in the six groups for  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid indices are given in fig.  <dig>  the largest group is hydrophobicity having  <dig> indices and the second largest group is alpha and turn propensities having  <dig> indices . the sizes of the other four groups are relatively small.

RESULTS
identified properties by ibcga
the statistical result of st in selecting property sets from r = <dig> independent runs on dnaset and dnaaset is given in fig.  <dig>  the 18th and 6th runs having the highest scores for dnaset and dnaaset respectively are selected, and their prediction accuracies for various numbers of selected features are given in fig.  <dig>  the robust solutions s <dig> and s <dig> having m= <dig> and  <dig> features with accuracies of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for dnaset and dnaaset, respectively, are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  where the aaindex identity numbers and their property descriptions are provided.

an efficient way to study effects of several factors simultaneously is to utilize orthogonal experimental design used in iga  <cit> . the main effect difference  of orthogonal experimental design can estimate effects of individual features according to the value of med  <cit> . the most effective property has the largest value of med. the m properties ranked by using med are shown in fig.  <dig>  the properties of rank  <dig> are identity numbers h <dig>  and b <dig>  for dnaset and dnaaset, belonging to the groups hydrophobicity and beta propensity, respectively.

prediction performance evaluation
to evaluate the effectiveness of the identified m informative feature vectors , we implemented the predictor using the same single classifier svm with the feature types, amino acid composition  and pssm  <cit> . additionally, the selected pcps combined with aac and pssm were also evaluated, as shown in table  <dig>  aac is a 20-dimensional vector of amino acid composition. pssm is the feature representation of  <dig> features. pcps +aac and pcps +pssm are two hybrid feature types.

considering the dna-binding domain data set dnaset, the set of m= <dig> informative properties  identified by auto-idpcps performs best where the robust solution sr with accuracy of  <dig> % is used. the four compared methods aac, pssm, pcps+aac, and pcps+pssm have accuracies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. for the dna-binding protein data set dnaaest, the method using pcps with m= <dig> informative properties  is slightly better than the pssm- <dig> . however, pcps+pssm can improve both pcps and pssm to the accuracy of  <dig> %. when the method using the trained svm with pcps was evaluated by the independent test data set dnaiset, the method using selected pcps has the accuracy of  <dig> % , slightly worse than the method pssm- <dig> with the accuracy of  <dig> %   <cit> .

sa: accurate solution, sr: robust solution, sen.: sensitivity, spe.: specificity, mcc: matthew’s correlation coefficient, pcps: the m informative properties, pssm*: obtained from  <cit> .

a small, high-performance features set of size c that one property is selected from each of the identified c clusters using the optimization algorithm iga is given in table  <dig>  where c= <dig> and  <dig> for dnaset and dnaaset, respectively. the accuracies of the robust solutions using the c features with svm are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for dnaset and dnaaset, respectively. the properties and their descriptions are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

the experimental results reveal that the identified small set of m physicochemical properties with a simple sequence representation and a single svm classifier is promising, compared with the pssm feature type. however, the identified physicochemical properties are interpretable for further understanding the dna-binding mechanism.

analyzing physicochemical properties for binding mechanism
the selected features of the conducted  <dig> runs are very different in terms of feature id from  <dig> properties. the appearance frequency of each identified cluster in the  <dig> runs is shown in fig.  <dig>  from the statistic result, the clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> with very high selection frequencies are more informative for predicting dna-binding domains and proteins. the selected clusters of the  <dig> runs are very similar in terms of cluster id from  <dig> clusters. the m= <dig> properties  belong to five clusters which are the same with the five clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for predicting dna-binding proteins, the m= <dig> properties  belong to eight clusters, which are the same five clusters and additional three clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the results reveal that the identified features of the robust solution sr belong to informative clusters. therefore, the informative clusters can provide informative properties to be further investigated if these properties were not selected by the feature selection method.

an illustration example for exploring promising properties is given in fig.  <dig>  the both feature sets s <dig>  and s <dig>  are selected for predicting dna-binding domains in dnaset that one property is selected from one of five clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the identified properties h <dig> and a <dig> belong to the hydrophobicity, and alpha and turn propensities groups respectively, but they belong to the same cluster  <dig> with a relatively small distance  <dig> . the prediction accuracy of s <dig> by replacing h <dig> with h <dig> is  <dig>  %. on the other hand, h <dig> belonging to the cluster  <dig> and hydrophobicity group used in  <cit>  can be inferred from feature sets s <dig> and s <dig>  after analyzing all candidate properties, we identify some properties in the five identified clusters for analyzing dna-binding domains, shown in table  <dig>  some typical properties discovered are hydrophobicity, secondary structure, charge, solvent accessibility, polarity, flexibility, normalized van der waals volume, pk ), etc.

cid: cluster id. pcp: physicochemical and biochemical property

most of identified properties were used in previous works  <cit> , but a few properties such as the flexibility property h8: bhar <dig> in cluster  <dig> “average flexibility indices ” are not utilized yet in existing method of predicting dna-binding domains. the correlation between protein flexibility and protein function suggests a link between dna-binding activity and the conformational freedom of the dna-binding domain  <cit> .

although most identified properties were mentioned in literature, it is not easy to know which amino acid index is the best feature in designing accurate prediction method. for example, the two feature vectors of properties h8: bhar <dig> and a: <dig> karp <dig> “flexibility parameter for no rigid neighbours ” belonging to different clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are dissimilar. from table  <dig>  it can be found that the four clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> has properties, h115: hopt <dig> ), h355: rosm <dig> ), h398: zimj <dig> ), and h252: pram <dig> ), respectively, belonging to the hydrophobicity group. the scenario reveals that more than one feature vectors may be needed in utilizing one physicochemical property to advance prediction accuracy.

discussion
to avoid from overfitting the small-scale data sets in identifying physicochemical properties using an optimization approach, this study proposes a hybrid computational method of combining evidences by considering robust features and biological meanings from literature. these discovered properties in predicting and analyzing the dna-binding mechanism can be further investigated.

in this study, the proposed approach auto-idpcps aims to identify an informative feature set of physicochemical and biochemical properties, rather than proposing an accurate method for predicting dna-binding domains/proteins. some techniques can be used to improve the prediction accuracy such as using ensemble classifiers with hybrid feature types and boosting techniques.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has proposed a systematic approach auto-idpcps to automatically identify an informative set of physicochemical and biochemical properties in the aaindex database to design svm-based classifiers for predicting and analyzing dna-binding domains/proteins. since the aaindex database contains  <dig> physicochemical and biochemical properties of  <dig> naturally occurring amino acids that are the building-blocks of proteins, the proposed approach auto-idpcps using an optimization method of feature selection can be useful and efficient for selecting informative physicochemical and biochemical properties, which is helpful in designing prediction methods for protein functions from sequences.
