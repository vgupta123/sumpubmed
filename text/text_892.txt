BACKGROUND
co-evolution strategies are a common phenomenon in herbivorous insect-plant interactions  <cit> . insects employ various strategies to increase their performance and fitness, while plants also develop efficient strategies to defend against particular insects  <cit> . host plants can produce various allelochemicals to defend against the damage of herbivorous insects . plant allelochemicals possess beneficial or detrimental effects on the target pests; allelochemicals with negative allelopathic effects are an important part of plant defense against herbivory  <cit> . these compounds can influence the growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms. for example, the phenolic aldehyde gossypol can retard the developmental of the cotton bollworm, helicoverpa armigera   <cit> . the resistance of wild tomato  to several arthropods has been shown to be related to the presence of high contencentrations of 2-tridecanone  in leaves  <cit> . 2-td can stimulate ecdysone 20-monooxygenase activity in spodoptera frugiperda  <cit> . 2-td in wild tomato can defense manduca sexta and also plays an important role in the plant resistance to leptinotarsa decemlineate. 2-td is also known to induce an enhanced level of tolerance to the carbamate insecticide carbaryl in heliothis zea  <cit> . up to now, although the phenomena of plant allelochemicals retarding the development of insects has been found in many species, details remain unclear about the life-stage dependent manner and pathway of allelochemicals to influence the insect development.

insect pests have evolved various strategies with which to respond to allelochemicals from host plants  <cit> . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes are a major source of adaptation to plant defense mechanisms in insects  <cit> . plant allelochemicals are known to induce the expression of various cytochrome p <dig> genes in insects. the cotton bollworm is one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species in the world. many studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of cotton bollworm cytochrome p <dig> genes can be induced by plant allelochemicals . the expression of cyp9a subfamily and cyp6ae <dig> genes can be induced by gossypol  <cit> . the expression of cyp6ae, cyp9a, and cyp6b subfamily transcripts can be induced by xanthotoxin  <cit> . 2-td can significantly induce the expression of cyp6b <dig>  <cit> .

high levels of p <dig> gene expression are typically thought to coincide with an increased ability to metabolize exogenous compounds. many studies have focused on detoxification enzymes that can metabolize plant natural products . cytochrome p <dig> enzymes not only act as xenobiotic detoxification agents, but also play pivotal roles in various physiological processes including the biosynthesis and metabolism of 20-hydroxyecdysone  and juvenile hormone , which are the major modulators of developmental processes that result in molting and metamorphosis  <cit> .

we found that 2-td can affect insect development, and this type of effect was similar to the symptoms induced by the physiological imbalance between juvenile and molting hormones in cotton bollworm. we later discovered that a decrease in the concentration of 20e occurred alongside the observed symptoms. we then profiled the transcriptome of helicoverpa armigera and used eight digital gene expression  libraries for shading light on how 2-td retarded the development of cotton bollworm. these results should help to deepen our understanding of how plant allelochemicals influence insect development.

RESULTS
effect of 2-td on the development of h. armigera
6th instar larvae were fed an artificial diet containing 2-td  to evaluate the effects of 2-td on development. 10 mg/g 2-td is a sublethal dosage that was selected based on our studies . the pupation time of the treated group  was obviously longer than that of the control  . the larval weight on the 1st day of treatment with 2-td decreased significantly compared to the control group, and the pupae weight at treatment day  <dig> was significantly lower than that of the control group . the pupation rate and the adult emergence rate was significantly lower in the 2-td treated group as compared to the untreated group . the 20e titer in larvae was measured at 24 h. the 20e titer after treatment was suppressed to a level that was only 57% of the control level . the adult emergence rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control .table  <dig> effect of 2-td on larval development

sequencing and sequence assembly of the h. armigera transcriptome
the effects of 2-td on larval development are likely complicated and may involve several pathways and related genes. we constructed a transcriptome library of h. armigera with illumina sequencing technology. the library contained  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  with an accumulated length of  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotides  , de novo assembly generated a total of  <dig>  non-redundant transcripts, with a median n <dig> length of 597 bp, and finally the total number of assembled unigenes is  <dig> , the median n <dig> length of these unigenes is 695 bp . all unigenes were compared with the nonredundant  ncbi protein database for functional annotation using blastx software with an e-value cutoff of 1e− <dig>  a total of  <dig>   distinct sequences matched known genes, the species distribution of unigene blastx matches against the nr protein database show in additional file  <dig>  for further quantitative assessment of the assembly and annotation completeness, we applied the software tool busco , which is based on evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content, with default settings. out of  <dig> single copy orthologs for arthropods our assembly is 27% complete , while 19% of contigs are fragmented  and 54% are missing , the busco analysis results show in additional file  <dig>  assignments of clusters of orthologous groups  were used to predict and classify the possible functions of the unigenes  followed by ‘translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis’  and ‘replication, recombination and repair’  . common gene ontology  annotation was used to classify the putative functions of the h. armigera unigenes . pathway analysis of the unigenes was conducted using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation system.

p <dig> sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
in our study,  <dig> putative p <dig> unigene sequences were annotated by searching the nr ncbi protein database using blastx.  <dig> long p <dig> unigene sequences within  <dig> putative p <dig> unigene sequences and  <dig> full-length p <dig> sequences from b. mori were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . the annotated p <dig> unigenes in the tree belonged to the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> , cyp <dig>  and the mitochondrial cyp  clans  <cit> . among the  <dig> predicted p <dig> unigenes in h. armigera,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unigenes were classified into the mito.cyp, cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> clans, respectively.

comparison of p <dig> gene expression profiles at different developmental stages
in order to determine the p <dig> genes involved with the effects of 2-td on larval development, eight dge libraries were constructed to identify unigene expression profiles for shading light on how 2-tridecanone inhibited retarded the development of cotton bollworm. after removing low-quality reads, each library generated approximately eight million clean reads. among these clean reads,  <dig> – <dig>  million reads were mapped to unigenes in transcriptome libraries. the q <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . qpcr was used to confirm  <dig> unigenes expression profile results. compared with dge libraries results, the accuracy of these p <dig> unigenes expression detected by qpcr is up to 94% .

figure 1a and b show the summed expression of p <dig> unigenes and the numbers of p <dig> unigenes  in the different development stages. the total expression amount and the numbers of p <dig> unigenes was higher in larvae than in the egg and adult samples, with the highest total expression level of p450s occurring in 3rd instar larvae. during the transformation from eggs to larvae, the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> clan unigenes sharply increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, while the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig>  and moti. cyp clan unigenes decreased significantly from  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % to  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % respectively. during the transformation from larvae to pupae, the percentage of expressed annotated cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and moti. cyp clan unigenes increased dramatically from  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % to  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively; the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> clan unigenes decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig> % during this transition  during the transformation from pupae to adults, the percentage of expressed annotated cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> and moti. cyp clan unigenes decreased dramatically from  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> % to  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively, while the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> clan unigenes increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . all the expression of the  <dig> p <dig> unigenes in different dge library were listed in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> the dge library data for the expression of p <dig> unigenes in different development stages. a sum expression of p450s in larvae at different developmental stages. b the numbers of p <dig> unigenes at different development stages. 1: 1st instar larvae; 3: 3rd instar larvae; 6: 6th instar larvae

among the  <dig> annotated p <dig> unigene sequences, the expression of  <dig> unigenes  were detected in at least one dge library. three p <dig> unigenes were not detected in any dge library; either these were not expressed in the particular life stages that we examined or these were possibly pseudogenes. among the expressed p <dig> unigenes, 33% unigenes  were expressed in all life stages . some p <dig> unigenes were specifically expressed at a particular developmental stage: eight p <dig> genes were specifically expressed in larvae, all of these belonged to the cyp <dig> or cyp <dig> clans. we found one specific p <dig> unigene that was only expressed in eggs. likewise, a single unigene was expressed specifically in the pupae stage. three p <dig> unigenes were expressed only in females. all these specifically expressed p <dig> unigenes belonged to the cyp <dig> or cyp <dig> clans .fig.  <dig> numbers of p <dig> unigenes expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner. rpkm <  <dig>  was used as the criterion to judge the unigenes were not expressed in a given developmental stage. e: eggs; l: larvae; p: pupae; m: males; f: females

2-td-induced p <dig> genes related to hormone biosynthesis and metabolism
pathway analysis of the unigenes was conducted using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation system. to confirm the unigenes expression profile results, the expression of p <dig> unigenes induced by 2-td that related to hormone metabolism was analyzed with real-time qpcr . figure  <dig> illustrates 2-td affects the biosynthesis and metabolism of insect hormones . the expression of four p <dig> are suppressed by 2-td treatment: cyp307a <dig> , cyp306a <dig> , cyp314a <dig> , and cyp315a <dig> , these down-regulated genes are shown with solid blue lines in fig.  <dig>  the expression of two p <dig> are significantly increased by 2-td treatment: cyp18a <dig> , cyp314a <dig> , these up-regulated genes are shown with solid red lines in fig.  <dig>  the dashed blue and red lines indicate the down- and up-regulated products, respectively, and fig.  <dig> shown that 20e titers in the 2-td treated group were higher than in the control group. the expression of three hormone metabolism related unigenes were not affected by 2-td treatment . the real-time qpcr results of the other 2-td-induced  <dig> p <dig> unigenes were consistent with the dge gene expression profiles, suggesting that the dge results were reliable .fig.  <dig> 2-td affects the biosynthesis and metabolism of insect hormones . genes down-regulated following treatment with 2-td are shown with solid blue lines, up-regulated genes are shown with solid red lines. the dashed blue and red lines indicate the down- and up-regulated products, respectively. the portion with a blue background shows the biosynthetic pathway of 20e; portions with red backgrounds show the metabolic pathways of insect hormones  <cit> 




rna interference  insect hormones-related p <dig> genes

cyp307a <dig> , an insect hormone-related p <dig> gene that was down-regulated by 2-td in h. armigera, was selected for rnai knockdown studies. the cyp307a <dig> dsrna-treated larvae showed significant reduction of cyp307a <dig> expression as compared to the larvae treated with gfp dsrna . compared to the control,  <dig> and 85% of cyp307a <dig> expression was suppressed at 12 h and 24 h after feeding larvae artificial diet with 35 μg/g  cyp307a <dig> dsrna, respectively. however, no significant retardation of transcription was observed at  <dig> or 48 h after feeding .fig.  <dig>

the effect of the rnai-based knockdown of cyp307a <dig> on larval survival rates was evaluated in second instar larvae by feeding artificial diet mixed with 35 μg/g  cyp307a <dig> dsrna and 2-td  for  <dig>   <dig>  and 5 days. compared to treated with ds cyp307a <dig> larvae, the survival rate dramatically decreased in larvae treated the mixture of cyp307a <dig> with 2-td. the survival rate was 72% for the treatment with ds cyp307a <dig> and 61% for the mixture of cyp307a <dig> with 2-td, through continuous feeding for 5 days .

discussion
our experimental results showed that the plant allelochemical 2-td affects insect development , and we observed that a decrease in the concentration of 20e occurred along with the growth retardation symptoms following 2-td treatment . 2-td treatment induced the expression of p <dig> detoxification enzyme genes. insect p <dig> enzymes are classified into four major clans, namely the cyp <dig>  cyp <dig> , cyp <dig>  and the mito.cyp clan  <cit> . the mito.cyp, cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> clans contain a variety of single-member cyp families that are known to play important roles in diverse physiological processes . the cyp <dig> clan in insects can be further subdivided into the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families, which participate primarily in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds  <cit> .

20e is a polyhydroxylated steroid hormone that controls molting and thereby affects the growth of arthropods. studies using d. melanogaster have revealed that the halloween p <dig> genes  are essential for each of the steps in 20e biosynthesis  <cit> . cyp18a <dig> belongs to the cyp <dig> clan and takes part in 20e inactivation, converting 20e to  <dig>  26-dihydroxyecdysone  <cit> . in b. mori, cyp18a <dig> not only has temporal- and tissue-specific expression profiles, but also exhibits a distinct expression pattern that closely coincided with the peak of ecdysteroid accumulation in the hemolymph of b. mori, a finding that further suggests that orthologous cyp18a <dig> in insects is closely related to ecdysteroid homeostasis  <cit> . interestingly, we also observed that 2-td treatment dramatically increased the expression of cyp18a <dig>  , the increasing cyp18a <dig> will lead a lower concentration of 20e. our results clearly show that treatment of larvae with 2-td decreased 20e concentrations  and suppressed larval growth. cyp306a <dig> , cyp307a <dig> , cyp314a <dig> , and cyp315a <dig>  may be also essential for 20e biosynthesis. treatment with 2-td decreased the expression levels of these unigenes. we used rnai methods to confirm the function of cyp307a <dig> in h. armigera. larvae treated with cyp307a <dig> dsrna had dramatically decreased survival rates compared to the gfp dsrna control, this symptom was similar with rnai cyp307a <dig> in d. melanogaster  <cit> . compared to treated with ds cyp307a <dig> larvae, the survival rate dramatically decreased in larvae treated the mixture of cyp307a <dig> with 2-td , these results proved that the retardant effect of 2-td is mediated by cyp307a <dig> on development of cotton bollworm. some unigenes were annotated as the same p <dig> gene, but these unigenes have different expression profiles in one sample, these phenomenon maybe caused by these unigenes are not full-length p <dig> genes or they have allele genes.


cyp15a <dig> encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the last step in jh biosynthesis, catalyzing the epoxidation of methyl farnesoate into jh iii in d. punctate  <cit> . cyp4c <dig>  expressed in a heterologous system, was able to metabolize jh iii and jh precursors into 12-transhydroxy  <cit> . although cyp4c <dig> and cyp15a <dig> were not found to be regulated by 2-td, the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> genes decreased following 2-td treatment in h. armigera , and the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> unigenes suddenly increased during the transformation from eggs to larvae; the percentage of expressed cyp <dig> decreased during the transformation from larvae to pupae .  <dig> p <dig> unigenes of the cyp <dig> clan were found in our study. cyp4c <dig>  initially cloned from the steroidogenic glands  of crayfish, has been suggested to be involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis  <cit> . in diploptera punctata, cyp4c <dig> is expressed selectively in the corpora allata and metabolizes jh and its precursors into new metabolites  <cit> . cyp <dig> unigenes in h. armigera homologous to cyp15a <dig> and cyp4c <dig> may be involved in jh biosynthesis and metabolism. in our study, the expression of these genes in larvae was higher than in eggs, and was induced by 2-td treatment . four cyp <dig> unigenes  were specifically expressed in larvae, and one cyp <dig> unigene  was solely expressed in females. these expressed p <dig> unigenes seem likely to play important roles during these specific stages . 2-td treatment strongly induced the expression of cyp <dig> unigenes in 6th instar larvae , a finding consistent with previous research in other insects  <cit> . these imply that the increased expression of cyp <dig> transcripts induced by 2-td treatment would likely also affect jh biosynthesis and metabolism.

our dge analysis found that cyp333b <dig>  and cyp333a <dig> , which belong to the mito.cyp clan, were also regulated by 2-td . other 2-td-regulated mito.cyp genes are related to the metabolism of molting hormone, but there have been no reports to prove that these two unigenes are involved in the biosynthesis or metabolism of molting hormone. both the up- and down-regulation of these two p <dig> unigenes may be of critical importance in the development and metamorphosis of insects. as many of these genes are conserved among many insect species, our study provides a foundation for the functional characterization of the roles of these two p <dig> unigenes in insect development and metamorphosis.

about  <dig> p <dig> unigenes of the cyp <dig> clan were identified in our study. within the genus papilio , cyp <dig> family members are known to detoxify furanocoumarins, secondary metabolites characteristic of the host plant families consumed by these insects . in our study, four p <dig> unigenes  shared homology with cyp6b <dig>  cyp321b <dig>  cyp6ae <dig>  and cyp9a <dig>  these unigenes all belong to the cyp <dig> clan are known to be specifically expressed in larvae, and are thought to participate primarily in the metabolism of plant allelochemicals  <cit> . two cyp <dig> unigenes were expressed only in adult females. one cyp <dig> unigene was specifically expressed in egg and pupa, respectively . the ability of insects to metabolize xenobiotic compounds at different development stages may be related to these cyp <dig> clan p <dig> unigenes.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we found that 2-td can retard the development of cotton bollworm, and a decrease of the concentration of 20e occurred alongside the retardant symptoms . in order to further illuminate the relationship between 2-td and its function in retarding the development of insects, the transcriptome of h. armigera was sequenced and digital gene expression libraries were constructed in the present study. the expression of cyp314a <dig>  cyp315a <dig>  cyp18a <dig>  cyp307a <dig>  and cyp306a <dig> was found to be induced by 2-td, and these genes were also related to the biosynthesis or metabolism of 20e. expression analysis and rnai studies proved that the retardant effect of 2-td is mediated by p <dig> genes on development of cotton bollworm.
