BACKGROUND
francisella tularensis is a highly clonal, recently-emerged pathogen that causes tularemia, which presents in several main forms: pneumonic , ulceroglandular, and oropharyngeal  <cit> . the latter two are associated with lower mortality. f. tularensis is currently divided into three subspecies , with f. novicida recognized as a very closely related species, or as another subspecies by some authors  <cit> . these taxa vary in virulence, geographic distribution, overall genetic diversity, and host/vector associations  <cit> . human tularemia is a disease at which the clinical severity depends upon the route of infection, subspecies of the infection strain, and timely therapeutic response  <cit> . cases in europe are caused by f. tularensis subsp. holarctica, and in many rural areas of the balkans and countries further east outbreaks are water-borne, resulting in oropharyngeal tularemia  <cit> . no known cases by f. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica are known and only a few by f. novicida have been documented  <cit> . f. tularensis subsp. tularensis is restricted to north america, whereas f. tularensis subsp. holarctica is found throughout the northern hemisphere  <cit> . despite its wider geographic distribution f. tularensis subsp. holarctica has markedly lower genetic diversity than f. tularensis subsp. tularensis  <cit> .

significant gains toward deciphering the evolutionary history of f. tularensis overall and, in particular, f. tularensis subsp. holarctica have been made by using whole genome comparisons for single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery coupled with subsequent canonical snp  analysis  <cit> . numerous new groups were identified within f. tularensis subsp. holarctica   <cit> , two of which, b.br. <dig>  and b.br.ftnf002- <dig>  were predominant in europe but geographically segregated  <cit> . in the western european countries of spain, france, and switzerland almost all isolates belong to the highly monomorphic b.br.ftnf002- <dig> group  <cit> . in contrast, in large portions of central and eastern europe, from the czech republic to russia, most f. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates are assigned to various lineages within the b.br. <dig> group  <cit> .

additional analyses of the b.br. <dig> group are crucial for fully understanding the phylogeography of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica in europe and asia. this group contains significant genetic diversity based upon multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis   <cit> , indicating that considerable phylogenetic structure may exist that could be revealed with additional analyses. in addition, this group is widely distributed, extending from eastern europe into the border regions of the european/asian continents. importantly, the eastern geographic extent of the b.br. <dig> group is very poorly understood. this is because, to date, it has not been possible to place f. tularensis isolates from countries at the boundary of the european/asian continents and western asia, including georgia, into a larger phylogeographic context. based on growth characteristics, biochemical analyses, basic pcr methods, and dna sequencing, we know that f. tularensis subsp. holarctica is the predominant subspecies in georgia and in regions further east  <cit> , but more specific genetic information is limited. some isolates from the european/asian juncture regions and east asia have been genotyped with a subset of vntrs but have not been part of any global analyses  <cit> . although valuable for regional studies, homoplasy associated with these rapidly-evolving markers restricts their value for global phylogenetic analyses  <cit> .

in this study, we determined the phylogenetic structure of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates from the european/asian juncture country of georgia by sequencing the genome of a georgian isolate, comparing that genome to other available whole genome sequences to discover snps, and screening a subset of the resulting snps across  <dig> isolates from georgia. we examined diversity within the subclades defined by these snps using a multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis  system  <cit> . to place the georgian isolates into an existing global phylogeographic framework  <cit> , we also screened a canonical subset of the newly discovered snps across a large panel of european isolates belonging to the b.br. <dig> group.

RESULTS
georgian isolate whole genome sequence
initial analyses with previously described cansnp assays  revealed that all  <dig> georgian isolates belong to the b.br. <dig> group. one of the georgian strains  was sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer ii sequencing platform resulting in very high sequence coverage  when aligned to the lvs genome . subsequent whole genome sequence  comparisons among three published b.br. <dig> group genomes , the genome of strain f <dig> generated for this study, and the published osu <dig> genome  revealed  <dig> putative snps. most of these putative snps  were phylogenetically located on the branches separating osu <dig> from the genomes in the b.br. <dig> group . maximum parsimony analysis of the putative snps produced a phylogeny  with a very low homoplasy index , consistent with the highly clonal nature of f. tularensis. the phylogenetic topology of the fsc  <dig>  lvs, and rc <dig> genomes is consistent with previous publications  <cit> , and the small number of putative snps unique to the georgian strain is consistent with the low genetic diversity observed among other lineages within f. tularensis subsp. holarctica  <cit> . the new branch  leading to the georgian strain arises from a common ancestor that is basal to the previously described diversified lineages within the b.br. <dig> group and is separated from them by only  <dig> putative snps, with  <dig> of these putative snps leading to the georgian strain  and the other six putative snps along a branch  defining a monophyletic lineage containing the other sequenced strains from this group.

identification of new lineages and subclades
we designed assays targeting  <dig> of the  <dig> putative snps leading to the sequenced georgian strain  and screened them across the  <dig> georgian isolates  to reveal additional phylogenetic structure among these strains. all  <dig> snps were determined to be real and assigned the  <dig> strains to a monophyletic lineage  that includes six new subclades . we also designed an assay  targeting one of six putative snps along the branch  leading to the other sequenced strains  and screened it across dna extracts from these three sequenced strains, as well as the  <dig> strains in the georgian lineage. consistent with the bioinformatics analyses, dna extracts from the three sequenced strains all possessed the derived state for this snp, whereas the  <dig> strains in the georgian lineage all possessed the ancestral state for this snp. this confirmed that the snp was real and also branch b.br. <dig>  which leads to the lineage that gave rise to the previously known subclades within the b.br. <dig> group  <cit> . altogether, we identified a total of  <dig> new branches  and designated a single cansnp for each of these branches with corresponding snp genotyping assays . designating a single snp as canonical for each branch maximizes phylogenetic information while minimizing the number of required assays by eliminating redundant snps, thus providing a highly efficient means of determining the phylogenetic positions of isolates for highly clonal pathogens such as f. tularensis  <cit> . in addition, cansnps represent standardized phylogenetic positions for comparison in future studies performed by different research groups.

to understand the relationship of the georgian lineage to other eastern european lineages, we genotyped  <dig> geographically diverse group b.br. <dig> isolates collected in central and eastern europe across the b.br. <dig> and b.br. <dig> cansnp assays . all resulting genotypes from this analysis were phylogenetically consistent with no observed homoplasy. with just two exceptions, all of these isolates were assigned to the b.br. <dig> lineage. the exceptions were two isolates from the crimean region of ukraine that were assigned to the georgian lineage. subsequent, additional cansnp analyses assigned these two isolates to the basal b.br.027/ <dig> subclade within the georgian lineage. these results indicate that the georgian isolates, as well as the two isolates from crimea, are phylogenetically distinct from the previously described f. tularensis subsp. holarctica subpopulations.

the subclades within the georgian lineage did not display a differentiated phylogeographic pattern but, rather, were spatially dispersed in a mixed fashion throughout eastern georgia and the crimean region of ukraine . the assignment of the crimean isolates to the basal b.br.027/ <dig> subclade within the georgian lineage  confirms that this lineage is not geographically restricted to georgia, and is suggestive of a north to south dispersal pattern. that said, the overall geographic extent of the georgian lineage is currently unknown due to the limited sampling in adjacent countries.

further discrimination using mlva
mlva was used to examine genetic variation within each identified subclade of the georgian lineage . five unique mlva genotypes were identified among the  <dig> georgian isolates  that were distinct from the mlva genotypes of strains found north of georgia. calculations of mlva diversity  within each subclade  showed decreasing levels of diversity within higher resolution subclades . the most basal georgian subclade, b.br.027/ <dig>  , was comprised of a single georgian isolate that was distinguishable from the two crimean isolates in the same subclade due to a distinct mlva genotype. there were three mlva genotypes among the seven georgian isolates within subclade b.br.028/ <dig> . a single mlva genotype was shared by all seven georgian isolates in subclade b.br.029/ <dig> , and the two other intermediate subclades  contained only a single isolate each. only a single mlva genotype was observed among these two isolates and the eight isolates in the terminal subclade b.br.georgia  . in general, mlva diversity trended towards lower values nearer to the branch tip, consistent with shorter evolutionary times to generate diversity.

discussion
the low number of snps found globally among f. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates suggests that this subspecies only recently emerged through a genetic bottleneck and then rapidly dispersed across the northern hemisphere  <cit> . the phylogeographic model of vogler et al.  <cit>  suggests a north american derivation for the main f. tularensis subsp. holarctica radiation that spread throughout the northern hemisphere. however, previous analyses of the spread throughout europe and asia were hindered by a lack of isolates from the regions along the european/asian juncture and in east asia. this study begins to address this knowledge gap by describing additional phylogenetic structure based upon  <dig> isolates from the european/asian border country of georgia through the use of snps discovered from whole genome comparisons.

whole genome sequencing of a georgian strain revealed snps that placed the georgian lineage basal to the diversification of the subclades of the b.br. <dig> lineage within the b.br. <dig> group  <cit>  . in addition, a relatively large number of subclades  within the georgian lineage were discovered amongst a relatively small number of georgian isolates. this is fortuitous, and perhaps a consequence of the selection of georgian strain f <dig> for sequencing  <cit> .

georgian  lineage isolates are geographically distinct from the b.br. <dig> lineage isolates. georgian lineage isolates appear restricted to regions of the ukraine and georgia, whereas the b.br. <dig> lineage isolates are concentrated in central-eastern europe, based upon the isolates examined here. however, the true geographic extent of the georgian lineage could not be fully determined due to the lack of a comprehensive set of isolates from regions neighboring georgia. that said, it is clear that the georgian lineage is absent from central europe. the geographic division of the b.br. <dig> and b.br.ftnf002- <dig> groups into eastern and western europe, respectively, suggests that the common ancestor to these two lineages, and possibly the georgian and north of georgia lineages , existed west of georgia, although the lack of a comprehensive set of asian isolates limits our ability to draw conclusions about the f. tularensis subsp. holarctica radiation that spread throughout eurasia. likewise, data from our current collection of isolates suggest that f. tularensis was introduced into georgia from the north, though we unfortunately lack comparable isolates from the middle east. for the entire f. tularensis subsp. holarctica radiation in eurasia, a scandinavian origin remains the most robust hypothesis given that sweden contains the most phylogenetically diverse set of isolates in eurasia, including isolates found in the subclade immediately basal to the b.br. <dig> group  <cit> .

interestingly, at this regional scale, cansnps and mlva exhibited considerable congruence in identifying genetic groups. specifically, cansnps identified six subclades and mlva identified five, albeit with slightly different but not phylogenetically inconsistent membership due to the nature of the two different marker types. snps discovered from whole genome sequences will typically provide greater discrimination than mlva, as seen in subclades b.br.030/ <dig>  b.br.031/ <dig> and b.br.georgia , and can even be used to identify specific strains  <cit> . however, discovering these rare snps requires whole genome sequencing whereas mlva can identify nearly the same number of genetic groups by simply surveying a few highly polymorphic portions of the genome. at this regional scale, homoplasy does not appear to be much of a factor in obscuring phylogenetic signal for identifying genetic groups using mlva, although the relationships among those groups are less resolved as isolates from adjacent groups share mlva genotypes. together, snps and mlva provide complementary approaches, by first accurately placing isolates in a phylogeny using snps and then discriminating among isolates within snp-determined subclades using mlva. this step-wise approach has been termed progressive hierarchical resolving assays using nucleic acids   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we describe a new subpopulation in the b.br. <dig> group from georgia that is genetically and geographically distinct from the other b.br. <dig> group subpopulations found in europe. members of this new lineage are endemic to parts of eastern europe and western asia, though the complete geographic range remains unknown. the basal positioning of the georgian lineage and its restricted geographic distribution illustrates the need for studies on additional asian and east european isolates to gain a better understanding of the clonal expansion of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica.
