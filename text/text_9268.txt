BACKGROUND
ambystoma mexicanum , one of over  <dig> species of salamander, can completely reconstitute lost limbs after amputation. the amputation of limbs results in the formation of blastemas in the stump ends. these blastemas contain undifferentiated cells capable of growing and developing into new limbs exactly as they were before amputation  <cit> . in the early phase of regeneration, growing wound epithelium and epidermis cover the ends of the truncated nerves and the surface of the amputation site within several hours  <cit> . after the nerves and wound epidermis contact each other, the epidermis overlying the axon ends thickens, forming an apical epithelial cap  <cit> . fibroblasts from the surrounding tissue simultaneously migrate to the amputation site under the apical epithelial cap. these fibroblasts proliferate to form a mass of undifferentiated cells that subsequently develops into the new limb. in the absence of functional nerves, an apical epithelial cap and blastema cannot be formed on the amputation stump  <cit> . instead, denervated limbs undergo a wound-healing response post-amputation, and do not regenerate  <cit> .

in past several years, next-generation sequencing  technology has become a cutting-edge approach for high-throughput sequence determination. this technology has dramatically improved the efficiency and speed of gene discovery in many studies  <cit> , and has significantly accelerated and improved the sensitivity of gene expression profiling. for example, studies in the field of human  <cit>  and arabidopsis <cit>  transcriptomics have made remarkable progress. studies using transcriptome sequencing for organisms with complete genome sequencing have confirmed that the short-read products of ngs can be effectively assembled and used for gene discovery and comparison of gene expression profiles.

national center for biotechnology information   <cit>  and sal-site  <cit>  have already made available many cdna sequene databases for axolotl. however, there still exist many unannotated protein-coding genes or non-coding rna sequences that have not been sampled previously and are not present in existing cdna libraries. recent reports have also suggested that more ambystoma to human non-redundant  orthologous sequences remain to be discovered  <cit> . moreover, sequence coverage of transcripts is highly variable between different cdna libraries. with more available cdna sequences, the overall sequence coverage of axolotl transcripts will be improved. although previous studies have highlighted the usefulness of cdna sequencing for the discovery of candidate genes in the absence of a genome sequence database, a comprehensive description of the full spectrum of genes expressed in axolotl blastemas is still lacking. to our knowledge, the genome sequencing of any salamander species has not been completed.

several studies have used highly parallel  <dig> pyrosequencing to identify axolotl sequences which are used to generate a large-scale feature axolotl microarray  <cit> . however,  <dig> pyrosequencing has relatively lower overall transcriptome coverage when compared to illumina/solexa platforms  <cit> . several recent studies have employed the illumina/solexa platform to offer a far greater coverage than  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . however, in the early stages of this platform, the majority of illumina sequence reads could not be matched to known genes because of their short length. in general,  <dig> pyrosequencing had longer sequence reads whereas illumina sequencing had shorter, but more numerous paired ends read  <cit> . currently, the latest developments in  <dig> and illumina technologies offer higher resolution and are relatively consistent with each other. with improved quality and longer reads, the higher coverage from illumina technologies allows for the identification of low-abundance genes not detected in earlier studies of limb regeneration based on  <dig> pyrosequencing. therefore, illumina platforms are well suited for gene discovery and promising insights into axolotl limb regeneration.

the de novo transcriptome sequencing of axolotl blastema in this study produced over  <dig> billion bases of high-quality cdna sequences, which were assembled and annotated without a reference genome.  <dig>  distinct sequences, including hundreds of developmental genes and wound-healing genes were identified. the gene expression profiles of a regenerating blastema and a non-regenerating denervated limb stump, 14 days post-amputation, were compared using differential gene expression analysis. a list of genes significantly overexpressed in normal regenerating blastema was obtained from the results of the analysis. a subset of genes from this list was verified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction  and in situ hybridization.

RESULTS
illumina ngs and read assembly
to obtain the gene expression profiles of an axolotl blastema and a non-regenerating denervated limb stump, mrna samples of both types of tissue,  <dig> days post-amputation, were prepared and sequenced using an illumina sequencing platform. we performed a single sequencing run for each of the  <dig> tissues. after cleaning and quality assurance, we obtained  <dig> million 100-bp reads from both samples . these raw reads were randomly clipped into 21-mers for sequence assembly using soap de-novo  <cit>  to yield  <dig> , <dig> contigs  with a mean contig size of  <dig> bp. the size distribution of these contigs is shown in additional file  <dig>  in a previous report  <cit> , monaghan et al. generated over  <dig>  million reads and approximately  <dig>  unique sequences with a mean contig size of  <dig> bp for axolotl from a broader range of regeneration stages using  <dig> pyrosequencing. using paired-end joining and gap-filling, we further assembled these contigs into  <dig>  transcribed sequences with a mean size of  <dig> bp including  <dig>  transcribed sequences larger than  <dig> bp . after clustering using tigr gene indices clustering tools   <cit> , the  <dig>  transcribed sequences generated  <dig>  unigenes with a mean size of  <dig> bp . in this report, the term “unigene” indicates a transcribed sequence that matches no other transcribed sequence and has distinct sequences.

the data sets are available at the ncbi short read archive  with the accession number: sra <dig> 

annotation of predicted proteins
for annotation, blastx was used to compare unigenes against the ncbi nr database by using a cut-off e-value of 10- <dig>  using this approach,  <dig>  genes  were found to be above the e-value cut-off . because of the relatively short length of unigene sequences  and lack of genome reference in axolotl, most of the  <dig>   assembled sequences could not be matched to any known genes. figure 1a shows that the proportion of assembled sequences with matches in the nr database is higher among the longer sequences. specifically, sequences longer than  <dig> bp had a match efficiency of  <dig> %, whereas the match efficiency decreased to approximately  <dig> % for sequences ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp in length, and to  <dig> % for sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length . the e-value distribution of the top matches in the nr database showed that 40% of the mapped sequences have strong homology , whereas 60% of the homologous sequences ranged from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . the sequence similarity distribution has a comparable pattern, with  <dig> % of the sequences having a similarity higher than 80%, and  <dig> % of the sequences having a similarity ranging from 14% to 80% .

gene ontology and classification of clusters of orthologous groups
gene ontology  assignments were used to classify the functions of the predicted axolotl genes. based on sequence homology,  <dig>  sequences can be categorized into  <dig> functional groups . in each of the  <dig> main categories of go classification , “cellular process”, “cell part”, and “binding” terms are dominant, respectively. however, we found a few genes in the categories: “virion”, “virion part”, “metallochaperone activity”, and “electron carrier activity”. we also noticed a high percentage of genes in the “developmental process” and “response to stimulus” categories, but only a few genes for “cell killing” and “antioxidant activity”. to further evaluate the completeness of this transcriptome library and the effectiveness of the proposed annotation process, we searched the annotated sequences for the genes involved in clusters of orthologous groups  classifications. of the  <dig>  matches to the nr database,  <dig> sequences have a cog classification . among the  <dig> cog categories, the cluster for “general function prediction” represents the largest group , followed by “replication, recombination, and repair”  and “transcription” . the following categories represent the smallest groups: “extracellular structures” , “nuclear structure” , and “rna processing and modification”  . to identify the biological pathways active in the axolotl, we mapped unigenes to canonical reference pathways using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . in total,  <dig>  sequences were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways. the pathways with the most representation by the unique sequences were starch and sucrose metabolism , pathways in cancer , and regulation of actin cytoskeleton . these annotations provide a valuable resource for investigating specific processes, functions, and pathways in axolotl limb regeneration research.

detection of growth factor and transcription factor sequences related to limb regeneration in axolotls
fibroblast growth factors  participate in salamander limb regeneration  <cit> . for example, fgf- <dig> is expressed in the basal layer of the apical epithelial cap  <cit> . developmental genes are also re-expressed in blastema mesenchymal cells  <cit> . for example, homeobox a <dig>  an autopod marker in many vertebrates, appears in the distal region of the blastema  <cit> . therefore, sequences related to growth factors and transcription factors involved in regeneration were analyzed and compared to sequences from ncbi nucleotides and the est database. as table  <dig> shows, this process identified a number of sequences that are homologous to growth factors related to limb regeneration, such as transforming growth factor -βs and fgfs, as well as transcription factors involved in limb regeneration, such as homeobox  genes. in total, this study identified  <dig> tgf-β sequences. after removing redundant sequences,  <dig> different tgf-β isoforms,  <dig> different hox genes, and  <dig> different fgfs were identified . four tgf-βs  have been identified previously in axolotl  <cit> . this study identifies  <dig>  and represents a nearly complete collection of such genes in axolotl. these findings confirm the high quality and high yield of the sequencing data in this study, and may facilitate axolotl limb regeneration research.

comparing gene expression profiles between blastema and denervated limb stump
to identify specific genes participating in limb regeneration, the differentially expressed genes between blastema and non-regenerating denervated limb stump were analyzed using  <dig> different de novo assemblers to increase accuracy: trinity  <cit> , trans-abyss  <cit> , and soap de-novo  <cit> . blastx was utilized to compare the assembled contigs from the  <dig> respective assemblers with the protein database of xenopus laevis. the contigs with the best e-values were assigned to represent the potential axolotl genes. the fold change of the reads per kilo base of isotig length per million mapped reads  values between the libraries from the two tissue types was calculated to identify differentially expressed genes. the numbers of differentially expressed genes for each assembler are: trinity  <dig>  trans-abyss  <dig>  and soap de-novo  <dig>  because various assemblers deliver different sets of differentially expressed genes, only genes homologous to a xenopus laevis protein with corresponding contigs from all the  <dig> assemblers were selected to obtain more accurate results. with this strategy, we detected  <dig> genes with differential expression levels between blastema and denervated limb stump libraries. of these differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in blastema . among the up-regulated genes, anterior gradient rescues a denervated limb stump to become regenerating again  <cit> ; matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  is associated with metamorphic developmental processes in axolotl epidermis  <cit> ; sox <dig> is essential for sclerotome development and cartilage formation  <cit> ; and patched <dig> mediates hedgehog signaling into blastema  <cit> . the set of differentially expressed genes from this study was compared with previous sequencing projects using  <dig> pyrosequencing and microarray  <cit>  . only the data sets in the previous studies on tissues  <dig> days after amputation, similar to this study, were chosen for comparison. the unigenes that could not be annotated were excluded here. the venn diagrams in additional file  <dig> reveal overlaps between these  <dig> data sets. among the overlapped genes, genes known to be necessary for limb development and limb regeneration were identified including wnt5a which is involved in wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, and msx <dig> which plays important roles in the development of limb buds.

functional annotation of differentially expressed genes
to understand the functions of differentially expressed genes, the set of  <dig> differentially expressed genes which had corresponding contigs from all  <dig> assemblers were mapped to terms in the go biological process database and compared with the whole transcriptome background to identify genes involved in important biological processes . among all genes with go assignment annotations,  <dig> differentially expressed genes between blastema and denervated limb stump libraries were annotated. among the differentially expressed genes, genes involved in nitrogen and dna metabolism were significantly up-regulated in blastema, such as glucose dehydrogenase, gpi mannosyltransferase, and dna replication licensing factor mcm. these findings suggest that the cell proliferation rate in axolotl blastema is higher than in denervated limb stumps, a finding consistent with that of a previous report  <cit> .

validation of differentially expressed genes by qpcr
among the genes classified as differentially expressed in blastema,  <dig> regeneration-related genes were selected based on our interests and their differential expression levels were verified by qpcr. amplification of an endogenous gene, s <dig> ribosomal rna, was used for normalization. among the  <dig> genes determined by sequence analysis as up-regulated in blastema, qpcr results confirmed that  <dig> genes had higher expression levels in blastema . results also confirmed a >10-fold higher expression level for msx <dig> in blastema. msx <dig> is involved in the regulation of dedifferentiation for mature myofibers. the morpholino-based suppression of msx <dig> protein expression in myonuclei significantly inhibits the fragmentation and dedifferentiation of salamander myofibers  <cit> . in the initially developed limb bud in mice, msx <dig> appears in the entire mesenchyme. however, this expression is restricted to the most distal part of the limb bud as development proceeds  <cit> . when msx1-negative proximal limb tissues are grafted into the distal portion of the limb bud, msx <dig> is re-expressed in the mesenchyme of the transplanted tissues, which subsequently become dedifferentiated  <cit> . the homeo box gene hoxd <dig> was shown to be expressed at higher levels in blastema. in mice, the hoxd <dig> gene plays a key role in axial skeleton development and forelimb morphogenesis  <cit> . the present sequence analysis shows that fgfs were up-regulated in blastema, and this pattern was partly confirmed by showing up-regulation of fgf-8b and fgf- <dig> in qpcr analysis. the expression patterns of fgfs in this study are consistent with those reported previously  <cit> . we selected  <dig> genes classified as down-regulated in blastema to be validated by qpcr. the results confirm that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes had lower expression levels in blastema. among them, wnt-9a and wnt-2b showed higher expression levels in the denervated limb stump than in blastema .

expression patterns of differentially expressed genes in limb regeneration
because of the technical difficulty of completely isolating blastema from the underlying stump and epidermis, we could not exclude the possibility that the higher expression levels of certain genes in blastema might be attributed to contaminated neighboring tissues. thus, in situ hybridization may reveal the specific cells expressing the genes in this study. the hybridization showed that patched- <dig>  one of the genes differentially expressed in blastema, was expressed in the cells located in blastema . hybridization using the sense control probe showed no signal . the signal of patched- <dig> expression was limited to only a portion of blastemal cells, and no signal was shown in the epidermis . these results confirmed that patched- <dig> was differentially expressed in blastema, as seen from ngs and qpcr, and that it was expressed in blastemal cells rather than contaminated tissues during tissue sampling. similarly, pax <dig> was also shown expressed in blastemal cells . hybridization using the sense control probe showed no signal . hedgehog signaling, the signals mediated by activated membrane patched- <dig> and  <dig>  is required for blastema growth and control of dorsoventral patterning  <cit> . during limb development, hedgehog signaling up-regulates fgf <dig> to promote limb bud proliferation  <cit> . pax7-positive cells also appear in tail blastemas and mid bud-stage limb blastemas  <cit> . pax <dig> is required for the specification of myogenic satellite cells, which are myogenic progenitor cells. these results demonstrate that ngs procedures can identify potential markers for the blastemal progenitor cells that initiate limb regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
this study uses illumina sequencing technology to sequence the axolotl transcriptomes, perform assembly and annotation on these sequences, and analyze the differentially expressed genes. more than  <dig>  distinct sequences were produced with  <dig>  sequences below a blast cut-off threshold of 10- <dig>  along with various existing axolotl transcriptome databases  <cit> , these results can further help researchers investigate axolotl’s limb regeneration. this study also demonstrates the feasibility of using multiple assemblers to increase the identification accuracy of the differentially expressed genes involved in axolotl limb regeneration.
