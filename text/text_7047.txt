BACKGROUND
natural killer cells were initially defined as a heterogeneous population of large granular lymphocytes that were able to spontaneously kill target cells. human natural killer cells were later phenotypically defined as cd3-/cd56+ lymphocytes  <cit> , and can be divided into distinct functional subsets, the cd56bright being mainly cytokine producers and cd56dim being more effective killers  <cit> . mice and rats do not express cd <dig> on haematopoietic cells; thus nk cells in these species are instead defined as non-t lymphocytes bearing nkr-p <dig> molecules  <cit> , although the use of nkp <dig> as the standard nk cell identifier in the rat has been suggested  <cit> . there is less evidence for a clear functional division of nk cells in rodents  <cit> . criteria for the definition of nk cells have not been clarified in most farm animal species  <cit> . in the cow, nk-like cells have been described as cd3-/cd2+ lymphocytes  <cit> , and nk-like cells have been isolated on the basis of markers not commonly expressed by nk cells  <cit> . recently, the characterization of bovine nkp <dig>  enabled a more precise identification of bovine nk cells  <cit> . the nkp <dig> receptor has been proposed as the most accurate marker for human nk cells  <cit> , as it is highly nk-restricted and uniformly expressed by cultured as well as resting nk cells  <cit> .

the cd <dig> molecule is known as an adhesion molecule as well as a receptor for activation on both nk cells and t-cells, reviewed in  <cit> . in the cow, cd <dig> is frequently used as a cell marker in cellular immunology, and several anti-bovine cd <dig> monoclonal antibodies  have been described  <cit> . the functional role of cd <dig> in bovine nk cells has not been previously studied, but nkp46+ cells in cattle peripheral blood can be divided into distinct cd2+ and cd2- phenotypes, the latter typically comprising around 20% of the cells  <cit> . similar proportions have been reported in human blood  <cit> , but only a few studies have been published that functionally describe cd2- nk cells from blood in healthy humans  <cit> . there does not seem to be a strong difference in expression of cd <dig> between the human cd56bright and cd56dim nk cell subsets  <cit> . in the mouse, cd2- cells has been associated with immature cell stages  <cit> , but blocking and knock-out experiments have shown that cd <dig> is not necessary for well-developed nk cell function  <cit> . accordingly, cd <dig> has been classified as a co-receptor  <cit> , although the use of this term has been questioned, since apparently no known activating nk cell receptor stand out as dominating, unlike in t-cells  <cit> .

the scope of the present study was to investigate bovine nk cell subsets, defined by cd <dig> expression. our results show that both subsets are fully capable of nk cell activity, and blocking experiments confirm a redundancy of cd <dig> for nk cell function. furthermore, the cd2- subset is more activated in circulation and show a stronger proliferative and interferon-gamma  producing capacity.

RESULTS
cd <dig> expression in peripheral blood and il- <dig> activated nk cells
expression of cd <dig> was analyzed on nk cells from fresh peripheral cattle blood, and on isolated nk cells followed for eleven days in the presence of recombinant bovine interleukin- <dig>  . in peripheral blood, nkp46+ cells were divided into a major cd <dig> expressing subset and a minor cd <dig> non-expressing subset, the latter typically comprising between  <dig> to 30% of the nk cells. following rbil- <dig> activation, a moderate increase in the cd <dig> intensity was observed for both subsets, thus the initially negative population will in the following be named cd2-/low when rbil- <dig> activated. the proportion of cd2-/low cells increased during eleven days of culture and comprised 60–90% of the cells at the end of the period; this pattern was maintained for at least three weeks .

to elucidate the proliferation of these subsets, nk cells were stained with the cell division marker carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester  on the day after isolation, and cultured in the presence of rbil- <dig>  using quiescent nk cells as controls  <cit> . three days later, the cd2-/low subset had decreased more in cfse intensity than the cd2+ subset, indicating that the former subset had proliferated more vigorously . however, after six days in culture, cfse intensity in the two subsets were almost similar, indicating that cd2+ nk cells entered proliferation at a later stage than the cd2-/low cells.

to further clarify if the cd2+ and cd2-/low cells were distinct subsets, nk cells were divided by immunomagnetic beads into cd <dig> expressing and non-expressing subsets the day after nk cell isolation, and cultured in rbil- <dig> containing medium for ten consecutive days. throughout this period, no major change of the expression of cd <dig> was observed . the tendency of a low cd <dig> expression on part of the cd2- subset, as seen with non-separated cells, was not clear in these separated cell cultures. a frequent observation made was that the cd2-depleted nk cells entered an exponential growth phase at an earlier stage than the cd <dig> selected cells, in accordance with the cfse labelling results.

phenotype of cd2-defined subsets of nk cells in peripheral blood and following il- <dig> activation
the expression of selected surface markers in relation to cd <dig> expression on nk-cells was analyzed in freshly drawn peripheral blood, and following culture of isolated nk cells for  <dig> and  <dig> days. in peripheral blood, the greatest difference was seen in expression of cd <dig>  which was brightly expressed by all cd2- nk cells, and present but more spread out at lower intensities on cd2+ nk cells . most nk cells were weakly cd11c positive, but for this marker the cd2- subset labelled less intensely than the cd2+ subset. similarly, cd45ro was less intensely expressed by the cd2- subset. cd11b was expressed by a minor part of nk cells, similarly in both subsets. a minor part of nk cells, but proportionally more within the cd2- subset, expressed cd <dig> .

following isolation and culture of bovine nk cells for five days in the presence of rbil- <dig>  differences between the subsets became less clear . at this time cd <dig> and cd <dig> were clearly upregulated and expressed by almost all nk cells, cd11c and cd45ro were slightly upregulated while cd11b remained unchanged. cd <dig> remained clearly brighter on the cd2-/low subset and cd11c slightly brighter on the cd2+ subset.

following  <dig> days in rbil- <dig> culture, a further upregulation in both subsets was seen for cd <dig> , cd45ro and cd <dig>  while cd11c had decreased, and cd11b remained unchanged . at this time, differences between the cd2-/low and cd2+ subsets were not readily distinguishable. after three weeks, as primary nk cell cultures started to show reduced viability, a similar phenotype pattern was seen, although cd <dig> and cd45ro expression was even further increased in all nk cells .

evaluation of mrna expression of nk receptor genes in cd2- and cd2+ nk cell subsets
mrna was extracted from nk cell subsets selected as described above and cultured for one week in the presence of rbil- <dig>  standardized amounts of cdna synthesized from these transcripts were analyzed for gene expression using rt-pcr. analysis at  <dig> cycles showed that the two nk cell subsets expressed the nk receptor genes nkp <dig> , kir, fcγriiia , klrd <dig>    <cit> . no difference between the subsets measured as intensity of bands in agarose gel was detected. the klrj gene was considerably less expressed than the other receptors, and only appeared following  <dig> cycles . these results demonstrate that common nk cell receptors are expressed by both the cd2-/low and cd2+ subsets, confirming the nk nature of these cells.

ifn-γ production by cd2- and cd2+ nk cell subsets in peripheral blood and culture
to assess the capacity for ifn-γ production by peripheral blood nk cells, heparinized whole blood was cultured overnight in the absence or presence of rbil- <dig> and rbil- <dig> and analyzed in flow cytometry for intracellular ifn-γ in relation to nkp <dig> and cd <dig> surface expression. non-stimulated cultures contained very few ifn-γ positive cells, and these numbers were used as baseline levels to calculate net increase in stimulated cultures. from cultures stimulated by both rbil- <dig> and rbil- <dig>  the cd2-/low nk cells had a markedly higher proportion of ifn-γ producing cells than the cd2+ subset .

ifn-γ secretion by rbil- <dig> activated nk cell subsets was assessed by separating nk cells into cd2- and cd2+ subsets and cultured for one week as described above. following  <dig> hrs further incubation in the absence or presence of rbil- <dig>  the level of ifn-γ in the supernatant was measured in an elisa. in the presence of rbil- <dig>  the cd2-/low subset produced from  <dig> to 300% more ifn-γ than cd2+ cells . ifn-γ production in the absence of rbil- <dig> was negligible  by both subsets, and were subtracted as baseline levels in the calculation of these responses. the expression of cd <dig> was unchanged during this period, as shown above.

cytotoxicity of cd2- and cd2+ nk cell subsets
cd2+ and cd2-/low nk cell subsets, isolated and cultured separately for about one week in the presence of rbil- <dig>  were analyzed for cytotoxicity in a 51cr release assay, using two previously described target cell lines  <cit> . the bovine mdbk cell line was killed moderately more efficiently by the cd2-/low subset compared with the cd2+ subset by three out of four animals tested . addition of anti-nkp <dig> mab partly inhibited killing by both subsets in a similar fashion as previously reported  <cit>  and shown below . in a redirected lysis assay using anti-nkp <dig> mab and the murine fcr-bearing targets p <dig>  the cd2-/low nk cells was clearly the more cytotoxic subset in three of six animals tested, almost equal in two, and less cytotoxic in one . in the absence of anti-nkp <dig> mab only a very weak killing of p <dig> was detected, with no clear subset difference , similar to previous findings  <cit>  and fig. 5d.

effect of anti-cd <dig> mabs on ifn-γ response from nk cells
the ability of cd <dig> cross-linking to trigger ifn-γ production from nk cells was assessed by culturing nk cells for  <dig> hours in plastic wells pre-coated with anti-cd <dig> mabs, followed by measuring ifn-γ in the supernatants. in wells coated with one of the two tested anti-cd2-mabs , an ifn-γ response was measured, while in wells coated with the other , no response above background could be measured . this response occurred without rbil- <dig>  but was potentiated by the presence of this cytokine. the ifn-γ response by anti-nkp <dig> mab was similar to previously obtained results  <cit> , and was always higher than the anti-cd <dig> induced response. no ifn-γ above medium controls was measured with mabs against cd <dig>  which is present on most cultured nk cells  <cit> , indicating that the response seen with muc2a was cd2-specific.

effect of anti-cd <dig> mabs on nk cytotoxicity
available anti-bovine cd <dig> mabs have not been previously tested for their ability to activate or inhibit nk cell cytotoxicity. to investigate this, bovine nk cells were pre-treated with the same two mabs as mentioned above, and tested for interference with nk cytotoxicity in 51cr release assays. neither of these mabs could alter the nk cytotoxicity against the bovine target cell lines bl- <dig>   or mdbk , while anti-nkp <dig> blocked most of the killing. a similar result was obtained with the target kn- <dig> using nk cells from two animals . no induction of redirected lysis was seen with the p <dig> target , while anti-nkp <dig> did, like previously reported  <cit> .

discussion
the recent characterization of bovine nk cells  <cit>  allows this important field of innate immunity to be studied in the cow. human nk cells can be divided into functional subsets depending on the level of cd <dig> expression, but like in rats and mice, this antigen is probably not present on nk cells in the cow  <cit> , thus not allowing a direct comparison with the human subsets. however, cd <dig> expression divides bovine nk cells into two distinct populations  <cit> , and the scope of the present study was to examine cd2+ and cd2- bovine nk cell subsets for functional properties and status of activation.

around 20% of nk cells in peripheral blood of cattle did not express cd <dig>  similar to findings in man  <cit> . during two weeks of primary culture with il- <dig>  the nk cell population changed towards a dominance of the cd2- phenotype. this change tended to be more pronounced in young animals, but was also present in adults. no intermediate forms were seen at any point, indicating that the two subsets were discretely preserved. however, under these unfractioned culturing conditions, the initial cd2- population appeared to acquire a low density of cd <dig> receptors. in contrast, no such cd <dig> acquisition was seen when cd2- nk cells were cultured separately. more detailed studies would be required to explain this phenomenon, but a conceivable hypothesis could be intercellular exchange of receptors during cell culture, as recently demonstrated  <cit> . we have consequently chosen to name these subsets cd2-/low and cd2+ when cultured in the presence of il- <dig>  il- <dig> is reported to upregulate cd <dig> on human nk cells; partly as a minor intensity increase like observed here, but also as a proportional increase of the cd2+ population  <cit> , unlike our findings. species differences may explain these conflicting proliferation patterns.

interestingly, the cd2- subset contained the highest relative numbers of ifn-γ+ nk cells following cytokine stimulation, and ifn-γ secretion to the supernatant was also stronger following il- <dig> stimulation. to our knowledge, experiments showing ifn-γ responses from corresponding subsets have not been reported in other species. both subsets were cytotoxic against conventional target cells, the cd2-/low most often, but not always, being the most effective killers. these findings are in agreement with reports from human nk cells where both subsets were comparably cytotoxic  <cit> . we conclude that both subsets had fully developed natural killer cell functions, the cd2-/low nk cells being the more effective ifn-γ producers.

to identify appropriate activation markers in bovine nk cells we analyzed antigens known to be upregulated on other activated bovine lymphocytes  <cit> . we observed il-2-induced upregulation of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd45ro, in accordance with reports from human nk cells  <cit> . the unchanged cd11b expression and slight but transient cd11c upregulation in il- <dig> culture was also similar to human nk cells  <cit> .

in peripheral blood nk cells, two of the investigated markers  were highest on cd2- subset. expression of cd <dig> on nk cells has been associated with higher proliferative potential  <cit> , providing support for the increased proliferation of the cd2- subset seen here. cd <dig>  cd <dig> as well as the integrins are associated with cell adhesion, and notably, cd <dig> has been associated with binding to high endothelial venules  <cit> . hence, the differential expression of these as well as cd11c on nk cell subsets could possibly relate to adhesive and/or migratory properties, although it has been warned against inferring in vivo migratory properties based on the expression of adhesion molecules alone  <cit> .

in contrast to cd <dig> and cd <dig>  cd45ro was moderately brighter on the cd2+ subset. increased expression of cd45ro has been reported to be a transient phenomena in human nk cells upon activation  <cit> . , but the role of this molecule in nk cells remains unclear  <cit> . it is noteworthy that in parallel to our findings with nk cells, bovine gamma delta  t-cells have been reported to express more cd <dig> and less cd <dig> in a cd2- subset, although it was not stated which isoform of cd <dig> that was targeted  <cit> . furthermore, human peripheral cd2-/low t-cells were recently reported to show greater proliferative capacity as well as cd45ro expression, unlike cd2+ t-cells; these were interpreted to be immature t-cells  <cit> . they were by definition cd3+, and therefore of a different lineage, but also in nk cells the lack of cd <dig> expression has been linked to immaturity  <cit> . the knowledge of nk cell development is still limited, but definition criteria for differentiation stages have recently been suggested  <cit> . according to those, the cd2- subset presented here would qualify as mature nk cells since they show full cytotoxicity and ifn-γ production. the findings that they comprise up to 30% of circulating nk cells and express all nk receptors investigated on the mrna level would appear paradoxical if they represent immature stages. further studies would be required to target such aspects.

to complement these studies on nk cell subsets defined by cd <dig> expression, we examined the role of the cd <dig> molecule itself on bovine nk cells, by employing two bovine anti-cd <dig> mabs in functional nk cell assays. cross-linking by one of the mabs induced a clear ifn-γ response, similar to studies in human nk cells  <cit> . neither of the tested mabs blocked cytotoxicity against nk-susceptible targets, and they did not induce redirected lysis of an fcr-bearing target. in human nk cells, significant blocking of cytotoxicity by cd <dig> mabs usually does not occur  <cit> , and no redirected lysis effect was observed  <cit> , although cross-linking by conjugated mabs against different epitopes could trigger cytotoxicity  <cit> . similar observations have been done in mice  <cit> . the human cd <dig> molecule has later been shown to contain a continuum of overlapping epitopes, to which different mabs may bind with various degrees of functional interference  <cit> . on this background, our experiments cannot exclude a cd <dig> function in cytotoxicity. nevertheless, one cd <dig> mab that apparently bound to a reactive epitope, since it could trigger ifn-γ production, did not affect target lysis. together with the observation that cd2- nk cells were fully cytotoxic and produced ifn-γ, we conclude that, similar to other species, the cd <dig> molecule is not necessary for bovine nk cell function.

bovine nk or nk-like cells have sometimes been defined as cd3-/cd2+ lymphocytes  <cit> . this may partly have been founded on reports that bovine pbmcs expressing cd <dig> were more cytotoxic than cd2- pbmcs  <cit> . however, due to lack of nk-specific markers, those results could not be adjusted for the relative content of nk cells within each population. our studies show that most nk cells in blood are cd2+. considering that the majority of pbmcs do not express cd <dig>  the proportion of cd2- nk cells would constitute only a small fraction of this population, hence providing a likely explanation for the cytotoxicity pattern shown by campos et al.  <cit> . furthermore, in a report where cd3-/cd2+ cells were classified as nk cells, cd3-/cd2-lymphocytes were reported as a not previously described "null cell" population  <cit> . our present and previous studies  <cit>  should provide evidence that these were most likely nk cells. in conclusion, we find that nk cell definitions based on a cd2+ phenotype exclude an important subset of bovine nk cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated here that cd2- and cd2+ subsets of bovine nk cells in peripheral blood have distinct phenotypic and functional properties, both subsets fulfilling criteria for being natural killer cells. the cd2- subset of nk cells show phenotypical signs of being more activated, both obtained from blood and during the first days of il- <dig> culture, they are better ifn-γ producers and have higher proliferative capacity. both subsets are cytotoxic and carry mrna transcripts for a set of common nk cell receptors. one anti-cd2-mab could incite an ifn-γ response from bovine nk cells, but no alteration of cytotoxicity was found by two tested mabs. the results presented here establish nkp46+/cd2- cells as a distinct, activated and fully functional subset of nk cells in the cow, with a particular capacity for ifn-γ production.
