BACKGROUND
drought stress is one of the most severe environmental problems that significantly threaten agriculture. it limits the growth, development, and ultimately the yields of crop plants worldwide  <cit> . the mechanisms of plants to response and adapt the water deficient condition at both cellular and molecular levels include the increasing of stomatal resistance, the developing of deeper root system to obtain more water and the activating other stress-response mechanisms to re-establish cellular homeostasis and protect cellular machinery from the oxidative stresses imposed by prolonged drought stress .

a series of complicated molecular mechanisms are known to be involved in drought-stress responses in plants. the best-known example of this is the signaling associated with abscisic acid . endogenous aba levels were increased and aba-dependent and aba-independent transcriptional regulatory networks were induced under drought stress conditions  <cit> . in addition, a class of short endogenous non-coding rnas termed mirnas also involved in the plant biological processes to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level under drought-stress condition  <cit> . for example, aba treatment and drought stress induces the accumulation of mir <dig>  and this this mirna molecule targets myb transcription factors  that positively regulate aba responses during seed germination in arabidopsis. mir <dig> is part of a negative feedback loop that regulates aba responses  <cit> . li et al. found that mir169a and mir169c are substantially down-regulated by drought and noted that this leads to enhanced drought tolerance in arabidopsis by increasing the expression of nfya <dig> , which is a crucially-important transcription factor that regulates the expression of a number of drought-responsive genes  <cit> . studies have also found that mirna <dig> plays important roles in drought responses in rice and tomato  <cit> .

recent advances in sequencing technology have facilitated the discovery of new drought-response genes and small rnas in plants. transcriptome sequencing  approaches have been successfully applied to study gene expression patterns under drought stress conditions in various plants, including arabidopsis  <cit> , potato  <cit> , rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , maize  <cit> , cynanchum komarovii  <cit> , citrullus colocynthis  <cit> , and brassica napus  <cit> . moreover, novel drought-stress-related mirnas have been identified with small rna sequencing technology in rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , sugarcane  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit> , and potato  <cit> .

tobacco is an economically-important crop grown in many regions around the world. the draft sequences of the genomes of two tobacco species, nicotiana tabacum  <cit>  and nicotiana benthamiana  <cit> , provide a framework for the identification and functional characterization of genes and genetic networks in tobacco to enable crop improvement and basic research. improving tolerance to drought stress in tobacco and other crops is of great economic importance. increased understanding of the biochemical and molecular basis of plant drought-stress response processes, including studies performed at a whole-genome level should help identify integrated biological pathways involved drought responses, and such knowledge holds great promise for improving crop yields. although several studies have documented gene expression or mirna profiling under drought-stress treatment of tobacco , our focus here is the integrated analysis of both mrna and mirna profiling in tobacco under both drought stress and re-watering treatments, which should allow a high-resolution picture of the interactions that occur between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation during plant drought-stress responses.

to better understand the molecular basis of drought-stress responses in tobacco, we analyzed sequence data from both mrna and small rna libraries prepared from leaves of tobacco  from three treatments: untreated-control condition , drought stress , and re-watering treatment . these sample libraries were sequenced with the illumina hiseq platform. we compared the gene expression and mirna profiles of tobacco leaves subjected to drought stress and re-watering treatment. the integrated analysis of mrna and small rna in our study provides a view of candidate drought-responsive genes and mirna molecules in tobacco, and these can potentially be used in marker-assisted selection and in the development of drought-tolerant tobacco lines.

RESULTS
gross phenotype and physiological analyses of tobacco plants
for these experiments, plants of the three treatment groups  were grown in pots in a greenhouse, and the treatment period lasted for 10 days . cl plants were watered with 1000 ml water on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  dl plants received no water for ten days. wl plants were re-watered, to full soil media saturation, on day  <dig>  note that the wl group plants were exhibiting severe wilting of leaves by day 7; the period from the re-watering on day  <dig> to sample collection on day  <dig> was represented the ‘re-watering recovery phase’ from drought. figure 1a presents photographs of plants from the cl, dl, and wl groups at on day  <dig>  the cl plants grew regularly and their leaves remained green. the leaves of the dl plants were turned yellow and wilted. wl plants were able to recover from wilting.fig.  <dig> gross phenotypes and physiological analyses of tobacco plants from the control, drought stress, and re-watering treatment groups. the growth status of control, drought-stress, and re-watering plants . bar graph depicting the results from a chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of cl, dl, and wl leaves . bar graph depicting the water content measurement results for cl, dl, and wl leaves . data are presented as means ± s.d. . student’s t-test,** p-value <  <dig>  considered highly significant; * p-value <  <dig>  considered significant




we conducted chlorophyll fluorescence and water content measurement in order to profile the physiological status of cl, dl, and wl tobacco leaves . the result showed that the potential efficiency of psii photochemistry  for attached dl leaves was significantly  lower than that of cl or wl leaves  through the chlorophyll fluorescence analysis. the water content analysis indicated that leaves of the dl condition had significantly  less water than did the cl or wl leaves . these phenotypic observations and physiological measurements clearly demonstrate that the dl plants were experiencing drought conditions and were in a highly drought-stressed state. the wl plants clearly underwent some degree of recovery from drought stress prior to sampling on day  <dig> 

mrna expression profiling in tobacco leaves
in order to profile the expression of genes in tobacco leaves in response to drought stress, total rna was extracted from leaves of plants grown in the following conditions: control , drought , and re-watering . poly-a enriched fractions  were used to construct libraries for illumina sequencing . there were a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> paired-end reads in the three libraries , of which  <dig> , <dig> ,  <dig> , <dig> , and  <dig> , <dig> , were mappable and could be aligned to reference genome . on average,  <dig> % of the clean reads could be mapped to annotated genes.table  <dig> summary statistics of the mrna and small rna sequencing results for the three tobacco leaf sample libraries




we quantified the overall transcriptional activity of the genes in our data as reads per kilobases of exon region per million mapped reads  and found that  <dig>  protein-coding genes showed expression  in at least one sample. we further analyzed the correlation of the gene expression among the samples. the global profiles of gene expression were generally highly correlated between samples , and, as expected, the correlation of expression between cl and wl  was much higher than that for dl vs. cl  or for wl vs. dl . in addition, clustering analysis also indicated that the dl transcriptome was clearly distinguishable from those of cl and wl .fig.  <dig> gene expression profiles of tobacco leaves in control, drought stress, and re-watering treatment plants. scatter plot of global gene expression for the cl vs. wl, dl vs. cl, and wl vs. dl comparisons; pearson correlation coefficients are shown . hierarchical clustering of all of the differentially expressed genes  from the various comparisons 




differentially expressed genes in tobacco leaves grown under drought stress
to identify genes that are differentially regulated under drought-stress conditions, we used deseq software to compare the gene expression between various groupings of the three growth conditions. we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs between the dl and cl, wl and dl, and wl and cl comparisons, respectively . the overlapping degs among the three samples are shown as a venn diagram in fig. 3b. the extent of overlap of the degs between the wl vs. cl comparison and the other two comparisons  was much less extensive than that for the comparison between dl vs. cl and wl vs. dl , suggesting that the expression of most of the drought-affected genes observed in the dl samples was returned to a ‘normal’ state following the re-watering treatment.fig.  <dig> differential gene expression analysis of control, drought stress, and re-watering treatment plants. the number of differentially expressed genes  for the cl vs. wl, dl vs. cl, and wl vs. dl comparisons ; red, degs with up-regulated expression; blue, degs with down-regulated expression . venn diagram of overlapping degs among various comparisons . venn diagrams to illustrate the overlap between up-regulated genes in the dl vs. cl comparison and the down-regulated genes in the wl vs. dl comparison  and the overlap between the down-regulated genes in the dl vs. cl comparison and up-regulated genes in the wl vs. dl comparisons  . distribution of the various ‘molecular function’ go categories of the  <dig> overlapping degs between the dl vs. cl and the wl vs. dl comparisons. the go item “binding” can be further classified into “protein binding” , “nucleic acid binding”, and “others”  




detailed analysis of the  <dig> overlapping degs between the dl vs. cl and wl vs. dl comparison revealed that all of the  <dig> genes exhibited opposing trends in the expression patterns for the two comparisons:  <dig> degs that were up-regulated in the dl vs. cl comparison were significantly down-regulated in the wl vs. dl comparison, and  <dig> degs that were down-regulated in the dl vs. cl comparison were significantly up-regulated in wl vs. dl comparison . this result strongly indicated that these  <dig> overlapping degs were highly likely to be involved in drought-stress responses in tobacco leaves. gene ontology  annotation analysis revealed that  <dig> % of the  <dig> degs were classified into the “transcription regulator activity”, “catalytic activity”, and “binding” groups of the molecular function category . some examples of the  <dig> overlapping degs are shown in table  <dig>  a set of  <dig> genes with significant differences in gene expression were randomly selected for validation of expression via qrt-pcr with mrna from three individual plants . the expression of  <dig> of these genes was highly similar in both the qrt-pcr results and the rna-seq results.table  <dig> candidate drought-responsive genes exhibiting differential expression in tobacco leaves in response to drought and re-watering treatments




functional classification of differentially expressed genes
to better understand the function of the degs that we detected among the sample comparisons, we first conducted go enrichment analysis on the significantly up- and down-regulated genes that were detected by pair-wise comparisons in the cl, dl, and wl using amigo  <cit> . in total, we identified  <dig> significant go categories. we found that  <dig> categories were only significantly enriched with the degs the from dl vs. cl comparison or the wl vs. dl comparison, which might be associated with drought-stress responses in tobacco leaves . for biological processes, degs related to “cell wall organization”, “protein phosphorylation”, and “response to abiotic stimulus” were enriched in the dl vs. cl comparison or the wl vs. dl comparisons. for molecular functions,  <dig> go categories including “tetrapyrrole binding”, “sequence-specific dna binding”, “oxidoreductase activity”, and “pectinesterase activity” were enriched among the degs.fig.  <dig> heat map showing the differential enrichment of go terms among the cl vs. wl, dl vs. cl, and wl vs. dl comparisons. a fdr cutoff of  <dig>  was used to select the enriched go terms. the text with font color in red, green, and blue indicate, respectively, the go terms in the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function catagories




an informative analysis of the functional annotations among a set of degs can be achieved by studying the enrichment of degs in a particular pathway. kegg  pathways analysis revealed that  <dig> pathways including “cell cycle”, “dna replication”, “fatty acid elongation”, “sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis”, and “photosynthesis-antenna proteins” were enriched with degs in tobacco leaves grown under drought stress; these were detected in only in dl vs. cl comparison or the wl vs. dl comparison .table  <dig> kegg pathway enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes in the three tobacco leaf sample libraries




transcription factor analysis
transcription factors are widely involved in various biological processes and play important roles in plant responses to abiotic stress. in tobacco,  <dig> tf-encoding genes were found and classified into  <dig> different families by sequence alignment against the plant transcriptional factor database  <cit> . based on our sequence analyses, a total of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tf-encoding genes were detected in cl, dl, and wl, respectively.

further analyses revealed that  <dig> tf-coding genes of  <dig> tf families were differentially expressed between dl and cl, and among these the tf gene family with the highest number of degs was the ccaat family  followed by orphans , ap2-erebp , bhlh , bzip , and myb-related  families . similarly, in the comparison between wl and dl, the identified degs included a total of  <dig> tf-encoding genes from  <dig> tf families: and most of them also belong to ap2-erebp , ccaat , orphans , bzip , bhlh , and myb-related  families . as for tfs of interest to drought-stress responses, we found that genes in the ccat, c2c <dig>  bzip, bhlh, and hmg families were specifically induced under drought conditions.fig.  <dig> distribution of differentially expressed transcription factors in the dl vs. cl, wl vs. dl, and wl vs. cl comparisons




deep sequencing results of small rna libraries
to investigate the mirna component of small rnas and the dynamic changes of the mirnas under the drought-stress conditions, we constructed small rna libraries using total rna and a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> filtered high-quality reads that were obtained from the cl, dl, and wl, respectively. the size distribution of reads was not significantly different in the three libraries, and the majority of small rnas were in the range from  <dig> to  <dig>  with 24 nt as the most frequent size . these results are consistent with previous studies in tobacco  <cit>  and similar to results reported for m. truncatula  <cit> , maize  <cit> , potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , citrus trifoliate  <cit> , citrus sativus  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and rice  <cit> . in order to remove rrna, trna, snrna, and snorna, all clean reads of three libraries were analyzed by blast against the rfam database .

detection of known and novel mirnas in tobacco leaves
the investigation of both known mirna and novel putative mirnas were conducted by mirdeep <dig> program  <cit> . this program combined the position and frequency of small rnas with the secondary structure of mirna precursors to provide novel mirnas which may specifically find in tobacco. in total we discovered  <dig> known tobacco mirnas  and  <dig>  of the known mirnas were detected in all three libraries, while  <dig>  were shared in at least two of three libraries . further analysis revealed that the  <dig> known mirnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families, and mir <dig> and mir <dig> were the most extensively-represented families, totally accounting for  <dig> % ~  <dig> % of the small rna reads supporting the known tobacco mirnas in three libraries .

we also found  <dig> novel mirna candidates in the three libraries . the secondary structures of typical stem-loop hairpins in novel pre-mirnas with their alignments with sequenced small rnas helped to identify their precursors. among the novel mirnas,  <dig>  were detected in all three libraries, with novelmirna- <dig>  novelmirna- <dig>  and novelmirna- <dig>  as the most abundant mirnas .

differential expression analysis of mirnas and target prediction of mirnas
we compared the expression of mirnas in three libraries based on a poisson distribution approach  <cit> . for the known mirna in tobacco, we identified those five mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were differential expressed among dl and cl or wl libraries . similarly,  <dig> differentially expressed novel mirnas were found between cl and dl, and  <dig> were found between wl and dl. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were selected for validation via qrt-pcr analysis . we used the miranda  <cit>  program to explore the biological significance of mirnas and predict the biological targets of the dems. the mirna negatively regulates target mrna in their translational repression or mrna degradation. analysis to identify negative correlations between the expression of dems and degs revealed  <dig> potential mrna-mirna interactions between cl and dl and  <dig> potential mrna-mirna interactions between wl and dl . considering that some mrnas were putatively targeted by multiple mirnas, we identified a total of  <dig> degs that were putatively targeted by  <dig> dems. go annotation analysis revealed that  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the degs were classified into “catalytic activity” and “binding” for the molecular function category .fig.  <dig> the expression profiles of the normalized sequence reads of the known mirna families in the drought stress library  relative to those of the untreated-control library  and re-watering library . ** p-values <  <dig>  are considered to indicate highly significant differences




discussion
mrna profiling in tobacco leaves under stress
to achieve a goal in this study of investigating a wide range of drought-response genes in tobacco to dissect the physiological, metabolic, and cellular process through drought-stress, we conducted the experiments of high-throughput sequencing technology to find out the transcriptome changes in the leaves of tobacco undergoing drought-stress and re-watering treatment. the transcripts of  <dig>  genes were detected, accounted for expression of 60% predicted genes in tobacco genome, while about  <dig> % of the reads could not be matched to any genes in three libraries; these likely represent unidentified genes, genes expressed in tissues that we did not sample, or genes from incompletely-sequenced regions in tobacco genome. our experimental design with the re-watering treatment allowed for multi-way comparisons of differential expression analysis, and the trends for the degs among the cl vs. dl and the wl vs. dl comparisons were highly similar, strongly suggesting that the  <dig> degs we detected are in some way involved in drought-stress responses in tobacco leaves.

as would be expected, the go terms ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘response to abiotic stimulus’ were highly enriched with the degs , highlighting the efficacy of the drought treatments in these experiments for eliciting relevant responses and the seeming reliability of the gene expression data . the gene_with the identifier  <dig>  annotated as a late embryogenesis abundant protein, was significantly up-regulated  under drought stress, while its expression decreased  after re-watering treatment . late embryogenesis abundant  proteins are proteins in both plants and animals that protect other proteins from aggregation due to drought stress or osmotic stresses associated with low temperature  <cit> . heat-shock proteins  are usually induced to help plants cope with heat and other environmental stresses. such as, trichoderma harzianum hsp <dig> is involves in abiotic stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . our study strongly suggests the potential roles of lea proteins and hsps in response to drought stress in tobacco.

to perform the abiotic stress tolerance, antioxidant defense systems composed of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants scavenging the reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide  and hydroxyl radicals in cells experiencing abiotic stresses  <cit> . in our study, we found  <dig> degs annotated as antioxidant enzymes in the dl vs. cl and wl vs. dl comparisons, including gene_ <dig> , gene_ <dig> , gene_ <dig> , gene_ <dig> , gene_ <dig> , gene_ <dig> , and gene_ <dig> . previous studies showed that genes encoding glutathione s-transferases were significantly up-regulated under drought stress in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , c. colocynthis  <cit> , pinaceae  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> . consistent with these reports, our study revealed that gene_ <dig>  annotated as glutathione s-transferase, was the most significantly different degs between dl and cl; it was significantly up-regulated in tobacco leaves under drought stress compared to both the control and the re-watering treatment, with rpkm values of  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig> in the cl, dl, and wl samples, respectively .

transcription factors play essential roles in diverse biotic/abiotic stresses by activating expression of downstream regulatory and structural genes that enact plant stress responses  <cit> . tfs are known to be involved in aba signal transduction in both the aba-dependent  and aba-independent  stress response pathways. in our study, the tf families with the most abundantly expressed  of degs in tobacco leaves under drought stress were the ap2-erebp , ccaat , myb-related, bhlh, and bzip families . all of these tfs have been previously reported to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . thus, the differential expression of these tfs in our study seems highly reasonable and strongly bolsters the conclusion that these are likely to be functional genes in tobacco responses to drought stress. we found  <dig> degs annotated as being involved in the cell cycle regulatory pathway; these showed decreased expression levels in leaves under drought stress as compared with the control, and of these  <dig> degs were significantly up-regulated following the re-watering treatment . cell cycle is synergistically regulated by the co-operation of many cellular participants and synchronized events. the cells would die when the cell cycle was blocked due to insufficient cellular resources or other stress conditions  <cit> . in response to the drought stress in tobacco leaves, a host of genes encoding cell cycle factors showed decreased transcripts, suggesting that tobacco leaves under drought stress appears to experience a dramatic perturbation of the cell cycle, which likely prevents the further proliferation of such cells.

as a complex metabolic process, photosynthesis is well studied and is known to be highly responsive to drought stress. drought stress is typically accompanied by stomatal closure, reduced mesophyll co <dig> diffusion, and decreased rates of photosynthesis  <cit> . the down regulation of photosynthesis-related genes in response to drought stress has been reported for various plants, including as rice  <cit> , c. colocynthis  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and ammopiptanthus mongolicus  <cit> . our pathway enrichment analysis suggested that nine degs were associated with the kegg term “photosynthesis - antenna proteins” . similarly, go analysis indicated that that eight genes were classified into the “chlorophyll binding” go term . all ten of the photosynthesis-related degs in our study, with one exception, were drastically down-regulated in tobacco leaves under drought-stress. only gene_ <dig>  which is annotated as a chlorophyll a-b binding family protein, had increased expression under drought stress. studies in a. thaliana have indicated that photosynthetic responses to drought stress are highly complex and involve the alteration of the expression patterns of a multitude of genes  <cit> . our observations that many photosynthesis-related genes were among the degs associated with drought stress, in combination with the results for the antioxidant-responsive degs, highlight the complexity of the relationships between photosynthesis and drought stresses  in plants.

mirna profiling in tobacco leaves under stress
many recent studies have demonstrated that plant mirna molecules are involved in cellular responses to abiotic stress. this has been demonstrated with salt, cold, and drought stress experiments . here, we performed small rna sequencing on the cl, dl, and wl samples and identified  <dig> previously-known mirnas from  <dig> families known and identified  <dig> novel candidate mirnas. many mirnas with a wide range of expression levels were found in the cl, dl, and wl libraries. consistent with a previous mirna study in tobacco  <cit> , the most abundantly expressed mirna family across the three libraries was the mir <dig> family. this family includes mir166a, mir166b, mir166c, mir166d, mir166f, mir166g, and mir166h .

we found significant down regulation of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> under drought stress . integrated analysis of the mirna and mrna levels revealed  <dig> mrna-mirna interactions  between the cl and dl plants and  <dig> mrna-mirna interactions between the dl and wl plants. mir <dig> has been proposed to participate in the plant regulatory networks in responses to oxidative stress, water deficit, salt stress, ultraviolet stress, copper and phosphate deficiency, high sucrose levels, bacterial infection, and aba signalling  <cit> . previous studies have shown that down regulation of mir <dig> in response to drought stress facilitates the up-regulation of csd <dig> , and thereby helps plants cope with oxidative stress  <cit> . in our study, we found that mir <dig> was down-regulated under drought stress, which would be expected to lead to increase in antioxidant  activity. the drought-induced down regulation of mir <dig> in tobacco is consistent with the results reported maize  <cit>  but it is contrast to the results reported by trindale et al. for m. truncatula  <cit>  and wild emmer wheat  <cit> . also of note, and consistent with a previous study of mirna expression in tobacco  <cit> , mir <dig> had decreased expression in the dl samples as compared with the cl  and wl  samples. moreover, we observed the down regulation mir <dig> expression in response to drought; this mirna molecule has been shown to be drought responsive in arabidopsis  <cit> .

our combination of data for mrna and small rna sequencing from tobacco leaf samples from plants grown under control, drought, and re-watering treatment enabled us to perform a combined analysis of the drought-stress responsive genes and mirnas in tobacco. we identified many degs that are potentially involved in drought-stress responses, including genes related to responses to stimulus and stress, antioxidant defense systems, the cell cycle, and photosynthesis. we were also able to use our mirna data in combination with our mrna data to identify many putative mrna-mirna interactions that may plant important, higher-order molecular genetic regulator roles  in the drought-stress responses of tobacco plants. these findings provide valuable information about potentially novel mirna families that have regulatory functions and establish an empirical foundation that will facilitate further functional characterization studies of the genes and mirnas involved in drought-stress responses in tobacco.

CONCLUSIONS
in present studies, we generated mrna and small rna sequencing of tobacco leaves under drought and re-watering treatment and performed comprehensive analysis of the drought-responsive genes and mirnas. the results revealed the degs that potentially involved in drought stress response, including genes related to response to stimulus and stress, antioxidant defense system, cell cycle, photosynthesis process, cell wall adjustments and protein phosphorylation. in addition, our analysis also identified mirnas that may plant important roles in tobacco leaves responding to drought stress. these findings provide valuable information for further functional characterization of genes and mirnas in response to abiotic stress in general and drought stress in tobacco.
