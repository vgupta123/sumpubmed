BACKGROUND
proanthocyanidins are polymers of flavonoid molecules that are widely available in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, flowers, and bark, and especially in grape seeds  <cit> . these compounds possess a broad spectrum of antioxidative properties that provide potent protection against free radical-induced diseases, such as ischemia and reperfusion injury  <cit> , aging  <cit> , and carcinogenesis  <cit> . proanthocyanidins are also known to possess antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and vasodilator properties  <cit> .

glutamate is a major neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. glutamate increases intracellular free ca2+ concentration  in neurons by activating ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. in pathological conditions, including epilepsy and ischemia, a massive glutamate release leads to glutamate neurotoxicity  <cit> . the neurotoxicity is mainly due to n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors, which cause excessive elevation of intracellular ca2+ concentration  and subsequent neuronal cell death  <cit> . elevation of i following nmda receptor activation stimulates nitric oxide synthase , an enzyme that induces formation of nitric oxide  in neurons  <cit> . no reportedly also mediates glutamate neurotoxicity  <cit> .

some flavonoids have modulatory effects on i. -epigallocatechine gallate  increase i in u <dig> cells  <cit>  and inhibit glutamate-induced i increase in pc <dig> cells  <cit>  and cultured rat hippocampal neurons  <cit> . quercetin has stimulatory effects on voltage-dependent l-type ca2+ channels in gh <dig> cells and inhibitory effects on l-type ca2+ channels in ng108- <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, egcg  <cit> , apigenin  <cit> , and wogonin  <cit>  have a neuroprotective effect in glutamate neurotoxicity. proanthocyanidin extract from blueberries has reportedly reversed dopamine, aβ <dig>  and lipopolysaccharide-induced dysregulation of ca2+ buffering capacity  <cit> . however, there are no reports on the effect of proanthocyanidin on glutamate-induced i or cell death in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.

the present study determined whether grape seed proanthocyanidin extract  affected glutamate-induced ca2+ signalling and no formation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. it further examined whether gspe protects neurons against neurotoxicity induced by low extracellular mg2+ concentration  and oxygen glucose deprivation.

RESULTS
effect of gspe on glutamate-induced i increase
since elevation of i is one of the major causes of glutamate excitotoxicity  <cit> , the present study first examined the effect of gspe on glutamate-induced i increase in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. treatment with glutamate  for  <dig> min caused i increase. reproducible response could be elicited by applying glutamate  for  <dig> min at 30-min intervals  . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min did not affect the glutamate-induced i response  . pretreatment with higher concentrations of gspe  inhibited the glutamate-induced response in a concentration-dependent manner . however, pretreatment with  <dig> μg/ml gspe did not further inhibit the glutamate-induced response  . therefore, the present study used  <dig> μg/ml of gspe to quantify the inhibition of agonist-induced i increase. the  <dig> μg/ml concentration of ihea gspe used in the present study was less than or equal to the serum levels of polyphenols after intake of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract in humans  <cit> .

effect of gspe on ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist-induced i increase
to determine how gspe inhibits glutamate receptor-induced i increase, the present study used two ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid  and nmda. application of ampa increased i by activating ampa/kainate channels and then voltage-gated ca2+ channels in neurons. reproducible increase in i was induced by treatment with -ampa  for  <dig> min at 10-min intervals . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min significantly inhibited the ampa-induced i response  .

ca2+-permeable ampa receptors are expressed in hippocampal neurons early in development  <cit> . the present study tested whether proanthocyanin inhibits ca2+-permeable ampa-receptor-mediated ca2+ influx. pretreatment with nimodipine  for  <dig> min inhibited the ampa-induced i response . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min further inhibited ampa-induced response in the presence of nimodipine   .

in addition, reproducible nmda-induced i increase was induced by treatment with nmda  for  <dig> min at 20-min intervals . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min also significantly inhibited nmda-induced i response  .

effect of gspe on high k+-induced i increase
binding glutamate to its ampa receptors induced an influx of na+  into neurons and depolarized the neurons. this depolarization induced secondary activation of voltage-gated ca2+ channels  <cit> . to determine the effect of gspe on glutamate-induced secondary activation of ca2+ channels, the present study observed whether gspe affects the depolarization-induced i increase by  <dig> mm k+ hepes-hbss . reproducible i increase was induced by treatment for  <dig> min with  <dig> mm k+ hepes-hbss at 30-min intervals . treatment with gspe  for  <dig> min did not affect high k+-induced i response  .

effect of gspe on metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist or caffeine-induced i increase
group i metabotropic glutamate receptors, composed of mglur <dig> and mglur <dig>  are exclusively expressed at postsynaptic sites in the hippocampus  <cit> . they are linked to phosphatidylinositol metabolism and the formation of inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  and diacylglycerol. binding of ip <dig> to the ip <dig> receptors initiates release of ca2+ from intracellular stores  <cit> . the present study examined whether gspe affects the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist response to dhpg-induced i increase. reproducible i increase was induced by treatment with dhpg  for  <dig> min at 30-min intervals . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min significantly inhibited dhpg-induced i response  .

in addition to ip <dig> receptors, ryanodine receptors can mobilize intracellular ca2+ stores  <cit> . reproducible i increase was induced by treatment with caffeine  for  <dig> min at 10-min intervals . pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min did not significantly affect caffeine-induced i response  .

effect of gspe on  <dig>  mm o-induced i spikes
the next study determined whether gspe affects synaptically mediated i spikes. previous studies have shown that reducing o to  <dig>  mm can elicit intense i spikes  which depend on synaptic transmission  <cit> . i spikes were induced by  <dig>  mm o in the cultured rat hippocampal neurons  <dig> days after plating. the low o-induced i spikes gradually disappeared after treatment with gspe . at  <dig> min after exposure to gspe, the frequency of i spikes was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the initial frequency .

effect of gspe on  <dig>  mm o-and glutamate-induced no formation
no is important for glutamate-induced neurotoxicity  <cit> . the present study determined whether gspe affects low o-induced no formation using the no indicator daf-2da. treatment with glutamate  or low o for  <dig> h significantly increased daf-2t fluorescence. while the  <dig>  mm o-induced increase in no formation was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with gspe  for  <dig> min, and the glutamate-induced no formation was slowly inhibited at a later phase .

gspe protects neuronal cells against  <dig>  mm o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced cell death
reduction of o in the solution used to bathe cultured cns neurons elicits an intense pattern of excitatory activity and i spikes and causes neuronal cell death  <cit> . the present study was an examination of whether gspe protects cells against cell death induced by low o. cell viability was determined by counting the number of viable neurons before and 20- <dig> h after treatment . in the control cells, cell survival was decreased slightly . reduction of o markedly decreased neuronal cell survival  . a similar proportion of the gspe-treated cells died relative to the control cells . however, a  <dig>  mm o-induced decrease in cell survival was markedly inhibited by  <dig> μg/ml gspe  . the effect of gspe on oxygen glucose deprivation-induced cell death was examined further . the cells in glucose-free bss, with and without gspe , were gassed with 85% n <dig>  10% h <dig>  and 5% co <dig> for  <dig> min, and then were regrown in dmem supplemented with 10% horse serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a co <dig> incubator for  <dig> h. oxygen glucose deprivation decreased neuronal cell survival to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the control. however, treatment with gspe  increased cell survival to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the control.

discussion
the present study used an in vitro rat hippocampal culture model to determine the inhibitory mechanisms of gspe in low o or oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neuronal cell death. gspe reduced the glutamate-induced i increase by inhibiting the ampa, nmda, and dhpg-induced i increase in hippocampal neurons. synaptically mediated low o-induced i spikes were also inhibited by gspe. gspe inhibited low o or oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neuronal cell death by inhibition of both i increase and ca2+-dependent no formation.

glutamate depolarizes membranes by an influx of na+  through non-nmda receptors, which secondarily activate voltage-gated ca2+ channels and induce ca2+ influx  <cit> . glutamate also induces ca2+ influx directly through nmda receptor channels and ca2+-permeable non-nmda ampa receptor channels. in the present study, gspe inhibited glutamate, ampa, and nmda-induced i increase, but it did not affect the depolarization-induced i increase from  <dig> mm k+ hepes-hbss, suggesting that gspe inhibits ampa-induced i increase by inhibiting ca2+ influx directly through ca2+-permeable ampa receptors. in fact, ca2+-permeable ampa receptors are strongly expressed in hippocampal neurons, especially early in development  <cit> . all these data suggested that gspe inhibited ca2+ influx through ca2+-permeable ampa channels and nmda channels. this data are indirectly supported by other reports that flavonoids such as baicalin, baicalein, and egcg, decreased glutamate or nmda-induced i increase  <cit> .

the group i metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, dhpg, induces a release of ca2+ from ip3-sensitive stores by activating plc  <cit> . in the present study, gspe inhibited dhpg-induced i increase. although the working mechanism of gspe is not obvious, gspe may inhibit dhpg-induced ca2+ release from ip3-sensitive stores or dhpg-induced activation of plc. therefore, further research is needed to determine whether proanthocyanidin inhibits release of ca2+ from ip3-sensitive stores or metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced activation of plc.

in the present study, gspe inhibited glutamate-induced i increase by inhibiting ampa, nmda, and metabotropic glutamate receptor-induced i increase. reduction of o in cultured central nervous system neurons to  <dig>  mm elicited i spikes that depend on glutaminergic synaptic transmission  <cit> . in the present study, gspe inhibited low o-induced i spikes. all these data suggest a possibility that proanthocyanidin can inhibit glutaminergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons. in the present study, gspe did not affect the depolarization-induced i increase induced by high k+, which is involved in neurotransmitter release in the synaptic terminal. thus, it is not clear whether proanthocyanidin inhibited synaptic transmission by decreasing glutamate release in presynaptic sites.

in the present study, gspe completely inhibited low o-induced no formation, and it slightly inhibited glutamate-induced formation. gspe reportedly has potent inhibitory action on no production presumably through of the inhibition of ca2+-dependent nitric oxide synthase  <cit> . in neuronal cells, no was synthesized from ca2+-dependent enzymes, neuronal nitric oxide synthase  <cit> . therefore, the inhibition of excessive ca2+ influx or ca2+ release from intracellular stores and formation of no by glutamate in the present study suggest that proanthocyanidin inhibits no formation by inhibiting glutamate or low o-induced i increase.

previous investigations have reported that proanthocyanidin protects multiple target organs from drug- and chemical-induced toxicity. gspe protects cells against acetaminophen-induced hepato- and nephrotoxicity, amiodarone-induced lung toxicity, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and dimethylnitrosamine-induced spleenotoxicity  <cit> . gspe inhibited 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and o-ethyl-s,s-dipropyl phosphorodithioate-induced brain neurotoxicity  <cit> . grape seed extract has also been reported to reduce brain ischemic injury in gerbils  <cit>  and rats  <cit> , suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of proanthocyanidin are mediated by its antioxidant effects and antiapoptotic effects, respectively. however, there have been no reports on the underlying roles of calcium signalling or no formation in proanthocyanidin-induced neuroprotection. gspe inhibited low o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neuronal cell death as well as both i increase and ca2+-dependent no formation. ischemic insults have reportedly induced i increase and formation of no in neurons  <cit> . in addition, proanthocyanidin blueberry extract is reported to have reversed dopamine, aβ <dig>  and lipopolysaccharide-induced dysregulation of ca2+ buffering capacity, thereby inducing neuroprotection in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . these results suggest that proanthocyanidin might inhibit ischemia-induced neuronal cell death by inhibiting glutamate-induced i signalling and no formation as well as antioxidant effects and antiapoptotic effects.

the daily intake of proanthocyanidins may vary from tens to several hundred mg/day depending on diet  <cit> . proanthocyanidins, especially oligomeric proanthocyanidins, are more easily absorbed and are present in blood after oral intake  <cit> . catechin and epicatechin are reportedly bioavailable to the brain after ingestion of oligomeric proanthocyanidin  <cit> , which suggests that oligomeric proanthocyanidins can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect neuronal cells. in fact, the ih <dig> grape seed proanthocyanidin extract  used in the present study was composed of more than 73% oligomeric polyphenolic compounds including monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric proanthocyanidin  <cit> . although the biological efficacy of gspe has been studied previously in humans  <cit> , the bioavailablity of gspe used in the present study remains unknown. however, it should be noted that this particular concentration of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract  was less than or equal to the serum concentration in humans following intake of  <dig> mg/kg proanthocyanidins or oligomeric proanthocyanidins  <cit> . these data suggest a possibility that ih <dig> grape seed proanthocyanidin extract  can induce neuroprotection after intake of oligomeric proanthocyanidin in humans as well as animals.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study showed that ih <dig> grape seed proanthocyanidin extract protected neuronal cells against the low o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. the neuroprotective effects of proanthocyanidin might have been mediated by inhibition of glutamate-induced calcium signalling and no formation. these results demonstrated that proanthocyanidin, and especially oligomeric polyphenolic compounds, may have future utility as neuroprotective agents or as supplements against glutamate excitotoxicity-related neurologic disorders such as epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and ischemia.
