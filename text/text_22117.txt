BACKGROUND
the basic helix-loop-helix  domain is a highly conserved peptide sequence across eukaryotic life that is an essential part of many transcription factors involved in a myriad of regulatory processes, from neurogenesis in mammals  <cit>  to environmental response in plants  <cit> . it provides two of the crucial molecular roles for transcription factors, dna binding and transcriptional regulation.

the tripartite bhlh domain is ~ <dig> amino acids in length. the dna-binding region  is located at the n-terminus. this  <dig> amino acid region is known to bind the hexanucleotide sequence e-box  or its degenerate forms in most bhlh proteins  <cit> . the two alpha-helices  bind other alpha helices to form homo- or hetero- dimers that stabilize the dna interaction and promote transcription  <cit> . the two helices contain ~ <dig> amino acids and are separated by a loop of variable length.

animal bhlh domains form six distinct phylogenetic clades, called groups a-f  <cit> . group b contains many ancient, highly conserved members such as myc, mad, hairy, and pho <dig>  <cit> . these e-box binders can be identified by the bxr motif at sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  where b is either h or k. animal group a proteins follow xrx motif at sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . members of group a include e <dig>  dhand, myod, and twist which bind the specific e-box sequence cagctg or cacctg. group e also possess a motif in the basic region, they contain p at site  <dig>  which allows them to bind the e-box degenerate cacgng sequence. distinguishing characteristics for groups c and f include the conservation of additional downstream domains, pas  and coe   <cit> , respectively. finally, group d, which includes members such as id and emc, lack any type of basic region and act as transcriptional regulators through hetero-dimerization of basic containing bhlh sequences  <cit> .

from algae to angiosperms, recent work on plants has identified ~ <dig> distinct bhlh domain groups  <cit> . these plant groups are tied to biological functions through characterized members and include processes from light and hormone signaling  <cit>  to tissue development  <cit> . phylogenetic studies have shown that plant bhlh domains are most closely related to animal group b  <cit> .

we have recently identified  <dig> distinct phylogenetic groups in fungi  <cit> . members of these groups have been tied to specific biological roles such as sexual development and glycolysis regulation. like plants, fungal bhlh sequences are most closely related to animal group b. similar to animal groups, the  <dig> fungal groups can be distinguished with only a few amino acids. for example, only fungal group f <dig> sequences contain a y at site  <dig> in the basic region. statistical classification analyses led to the identification of the sites that discern between fungal groups.

a primary motivation for this work was to accurately classify and distinguish bhlh sequences from plant, animal, and fungal kingdoms. there are various types of models that can be utilized for classification. some, such as decision trees, use solely the amino acid code and ignore physiochemical properties. moreover, they may have multiple solutions and thus unable to identify sites that are highly important for biological function. transformation of amino acids into numerical data enables the use of statistical methods such as discriminant analysis. such analyses provide the means to identify potentially biologically meaningful sites. atchley et al.  <cit>  developed five numerical indices  that allow translation of amino acids from alphabetical to numerical data. these factor scores were derived from factor analysis on  <dig> physiochemical amino acid properties. each of these independent factor scores  represent distinct molecular functions of amino acids. factor score pah represents the amino acid properties of polarity, accessibility, and hydrophobicity. the propensity for secondary structure is linked to the pss index. molecular size, codon composition, and electrical charge are represented by the ms, cc, and ec factor scores, respectively.

stepwise discriminant analysis  and canonical variate analysis  are two implementations of discriminant analysis  <cit> . these analyses examine patterns of covariation to obtain a unique classification solution. swda and cva have been used to identify the most discerning sites between animal groups and also between fungal groups  <cit> . these discerning sites are characteristic of the sequences within each group and are often tied to the molecular function of the bhlh domain itself.

herein, we conducted a study of the discerning sites that exist between plant, animal, and fungal bhlh domains. we built several classification models to discern kingdom origin and incorporated these into a web-based tool to classify any bhlh sequence. these models provided valuable insight into the fundamental differences between plant, animal, and fungal bhlh domains. we then constructed kingdom specific hmms  and used these to identify bhlh sequences from a large marine environmental sample genome project. identified sequences were then classified into kingdoms using our discriminant models. the tool, all source code, models, and relevant data are available at http://www.fungalgenomics.ncsu.edu.

RESULTS
comparing conserved sites in bhlh domains for plants, animals, and fungi
to quantitatively measure the conservation of amino acid sites in the bhlh domain we performed boltzman-shannon analyses  <cit>  for  <dig> plant , animal , and fungal  sequences . within these analyses we grouped like amino acids to account for substitutions of functionally similar amino acids. normalized group entropy values, ranging from 0– <dig>  indicate conserved to variable sites, respectively. finally, we visualized the frequency of amino acids per site in bit-score weblogos  <cit>  and provided the published consensus sequences  <cit> .

overall, the conservation of amino acids by site of the bhlh was very similar in plants, animals and fungi . the pattern of entropy in the three analyses was most similar for the first and second helices. within the basic region, fungal sequences contained more conserved sites and lower entropy values in general  <cit> .

note.–the molecular architechure of bhlh positions is compiled from previous work on crystalline structures of animal proteins. structural attributes noted are dna contact of the e-box , phosphate backbone contact , or buried site within the hydrophobic core of the dimerized helicies . highly  and moderately  conserved sites are denoted for plant , animal , and fungal  sequences. sites integral in the decision tree analysis  are also reported. last, swda  and cva  significant sites are shown within each factor score dataset .

further inspection of the basic region revealed that animals shared several moderately conserved sites with fungi. these shared sites included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> where the most frequent amino acid was r, e, r, and r, respectively. plants had three strongly conserved sites in the basic region, including sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  of these highly conserved plants positions, site  <dig> was also highly conserved in fungi, while sites  <dig> and  <dig> were only moderately conserved in animals and fungi.

in the first helix, many sites were highly conserved in all three kingdoms. these included sites  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  site  <dig> was the one of the most conserved in all three analyses with l being found almost exclusively at this position. sites  <dig> and  <dig> were composed of hydrophobic amino acids i, l, v, and m. site  <dig> was moderately conserved in all three kingdoms with the nearly the same set of amino acids . fungi shared conserved site  <dig> with animals only, and site  <dig> only with plants. site  <dig> was only moderately conserved in animals and fungi with r being the most frequently occurring amino acid. site  <dig>  at the end of the first helix, p occurred at a frequency of 92%, 88%, and 73% for fungi, plants, and animals, respectively.

we identified six conserved sites in the second helix, shared between animals, plants, and fungi, including positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the most frequently occurring amino acids in these sites were the same for all three kingdoms . one of the most dramatic differences in conservation occurred at the beginning of the second helix , where animal and fungal sequences contained a k and plant sequences were much more variable. finally, site  <dig> was the only conserved site shared exclusively between plants and animals, however, the most frequently occurring amino acids differed greatly, v, a, i, and l as compared to a, s, and v, respectively.

decision trees analysis
building a bifurcating decision tree based on observable characteristics has been the traditional method for classifying subjects  <cit> . using the model bhlh sequences, we built a decision tree based on the amino acids at given sites of the domain . starting from the entire  <dig> sequence dataset, bifurcating steps were added until there were less than  <dig> sequences in a subset, the tree hit a depth of  <dig> steps, or the subset was almost completely comprised of plant, animal, or fungal sequences.

the resulting decision tree provided a straight forward method for classifying sequences, requiring only eight steps. at step  <dig>  site  <dig> effectively discriminated animal sequences from plant and fungi, with the exception of animal groups d and e. site  <dig> has previously been noted as a discerning site between animal groups  <cit> . steps  <dig> and  <dig> split sequences based on sites  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this separated plants from fungi and animal group d and e sequences. finally, site  <dig> at step  <dig> split fungal sequences from animal groups d and e.

the decision tree accurately classified sequences as either plants, animals, or fungi. it had accuracies of  <dig> % for plants,  <dig> % for animals, and  <dig> % for fungi with an overall accuracy of  <dig> % . thus using only sites  <dig> and  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> and  <dig>  the decision tree was able to discern kingdom of origin for bhlh sequences with an accuracy over 92%.

note.-the accuracies are reported for several classification models; including, best hit blast, the decision tree analysis, swdas, and cvas. the first measurements are based on the  <dig> plant, animal, and fungal sequences used in building the models. the second set assesses the models with the  <dig> sequence set which were not used in building the models. the number of sequences that were unable to be classified  for each model are also provided.

stepwise discriminant analysis
to measure the discerning ability of individual amino acid sites at determining plant, animal, or fungal origin, we performed a stepwise discriminant analysis   <cit> . in order to perform this analysis, alphabetic amino acid data was transformed into numerical values by utilizing five numerical indices . the five factor scores  were based on measured physiochemical amino acid properties  <cit> . the transformation resulted in five numeric values for each amino acid at every position in each bhlh sequence. an additional factor score set  was created from the combination of all five factor scores. the result was a total of six factor score transformed datasets each containing  <dig> numeric bhlh sequences.

to determine the most discriminating sites, numerical sequences were analyzed using the swda function in sas denoted as swda{factor score}. the discriminating power of each site was evaluated by its partial correlation  and the accumulated average squared canonical correlation . factor scores pah and ec performed the best in swda, explaining 70% of the among-group variance in only  <dig> steps each. in contrast, factor scores pss, ms, and cc could only obtain average squared canonical correlations  of 57%, 61% and 64% when using  <dig> amino acid sites, respectively. in the first three steps, pah and ec obtained 44% and 42% ascc, respectively, and shared sites  <dig> and  <dig> within the top three discriminating amino acids.

when utilizing all, an ascc of 80% was obtained using only  <dig> different amino acid sites within the  <dig> steps. the three most discerning sites, accounting for 49% of the among-group variability, were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the most discerning site in this analysis, site  <dig>  was transformed using the codon composition  factor score. sites  <dig> and  <dig> had been transformed by the ec, and pah factor scores, respectively.

stepwise models were built from swda at cutoffs described in the material and methods. the  <dig> model sequence dataset was then classified by the stepwise classification models and the results recorded in confusion matrices . the models provided overall accuracies ranging from  <dig> % -  <dig> % for individual factor scores . swda{all} was the most accurate  of the stepwise analyses and utilized only  <dig> amino acid sites.

amino acid sites with partial correlation  > 20% were found to be highly diagnostic of plant, animal, or fungal bhlh origin . swda using the five factor scores , identified between 1– <dig> discerning sites for each analysis. with the most accurate stepwise model, swda{all},  <dig> sites  were found to highly discerning.

canonical variate analysis
to leverage more discerning power, we utilized all bhlh amino acid sites simultaneously in a canonical variate analysis  on the six numeric datasets, denoted cva{factor score}  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the discerning power of each factor score set by plotting the two canonical variates , along with the sqrt of the mahalanobis pairwise distance between the centroids of plant, animal, and fungal sequences. the visual distinction and the mahalanobis distance between plant, animal, and fungal groups was greatest in the cva{all}. although the mahalanobis distance between plants, animals, and fungi were smaller in pah, pss, ms, cc, and ec, the sequences clearly clustered among their kingdom of origin in each separate analysis.

both of the canonical variates  in the factor score analyses were important in discerning between fungal, plant, and animal sequences . the first cv in pah, pss, ms, cc, ec, and all explained 67%, 62%, 72%, 57%, 69%, and 62% of the total variation within their respective analyses. by default, the second cv accounted for the remaining unexplained variance. fungi and animals were separated from plants by the first cv in pah, ms, ec and all; with the second cv discerning between fungi and animals. in the pss analysis, the first cv separated out plants and fungi from animals; while in cc, plants and animals were first separated from fungi.

note.–the variance between plant, animal, and fungal sequences explained by each canoncial variate  is reported. the type of sequences  that are separated by each cv is also shown. within each cv, the top  <dig> amino acid sites  and those sites with weights > <dig> are provided. cv <dig> and cv <dig> in the all analysis had  <dig> and  <dig> discerning sites, respectively .

classification models were then built from the cva and used to classify the  <dig> model sequence dataset. accuracies of the cva classification models ranged from  <dig> % -  <dig> % for fungi,  <dig> % - 100% for plants, and  <dig> % -  <dig> % for animals . cva{all} was the most accurate model with an total accuracy over 99%. thus, through cva, we effectively distinguished bhlh domains from fungi, animals, and plants.

in addition to the first cv of pah, ms, ec, and all separating plants from animals and fungi, the mahalanobis distances between animal and fungi bhlh domains were smaller in each cva compared to the distances to plant domains. taken together, these findings suggest, as expected, that animals and fungi are more closely related than they are to plants  <cit> .

many of the top ranked sites of each cv, based on the magnitude of cv coefficients, were identified as major discerning sites in swda . sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were identified by swda and cva within the same factor score transformed datasets. for example, sites  <dig> and  <dig> were highly discerning when using the cc transformation. likewise for pss, the most discerning sites were  <dig> and  <dig>  site  <dig> was discerning for the ec dataset in both analyses. sites  <dig> and  <dig> in the pah data. while several sites were discerning for the ms dataset, none were shared by cva and swda. each of the most discerning sites had known molecular characteristics shared by the biological roles of the factor scores. sites  <dig> and  <dig>  discerning sites in cc, contact dna and are crucial for correct e-box binding. sites  <dig> and  <dig> are located at the transition from the secondary structures basic region to helix  <dig>  last, sites  <dig> and  <dig> play crucial roles at the start of their helices, detected as discerning sites in the pah analyses. thus, in addition to accurately discerning kingdom origin, we linked highly discriminating sites to those with known molecular functions.

classification model testing
to evaluate the effectiveness of the different classification models in discerning between kingdom origin, we determined and assessed the accuracy for a set of  <dig> test bhlh domains . this dataset was comprised of plant, animal, and fungal sequences not used to build models. in addition, we performed a besthit blast analysis for comparative purposes. the overall accuracy for each test was above 86% for plants, slightly lower at just over 79% for animals and 82% for fungi. besthit blast and cva{all} had accuracies greater than 95%. the cva{all} model requires an amino acid in every position  of the basic, helix  <dig> and helix  <dig> and could not classify  <dig> % of the  <dig> sequences. swda{all}, which used only  <dig> positions, was able classify a further  <dig> sequences that cva{all} could not. while the cva had a higher accuracy compared to swda , swda may be preferable when cva{all} cannot classify a given sequence. both of these models are preferable to besthit blast as they utilize site-specific conservation, provide a confidence in assigning each sequence to a kingdom, and may be leveraged by additional statistical analyses. in contrast, blast only provides a measure of sequence similarity.

bhlh origins from environmental samples
classification of bhlh sequences of unknown origin is one possible application of these classification models. to test such an application, we obtained a publically available marine environmental sample with > <dig>  million amino acid sequences  <cit> . we then ran interpro scan  <cit>  to identify the presence of the bhlh domain in these sequences. this resulted in only  <dig> sequences being annotated with the ipr <dig> signature. these  <dig> sequences were then extracted and classified using the swda{all} and cva{all}. additionally, we investigated kingdom origin through the best blast hit for each sequence . for  <dig> of the  <dig> sequences, cva{all} and blast agreed with kingdom origin. three of the remaining four sequences could not be compared directly to the cva{all} results as they had very low identity and coverage in the blast analysis. the hit with the best coverage and identity , was identified as an ostreococcus lucimarinus  sequence by blast. cva{all} classified this same sequence as an animal, however, the mahalanobis distance between the animal centroid and the algae sequence was greater than those between animal and plant centroids . this distance is not unexpected as many algae have been shown to be highly divergent from other plant bhlh sequences  <cit> , and only a handful of algae organisms were used to build the classification models.

note.–ten unknown bhlh sequences from a marine environmental sample as identified by interpro. the attributes of the best blast hit are reported . the results of the cva{all} are also reported along with the distance of the bhlh sequence to plant, animal, and fungal kingdoms. the predicted kingdom of origin is also reported.

to further explore the environmental sample, we built several hmms using the alignment of the  <dig> sequences in the expert data set. each model identified > <dig> % of bhlh sequences in the  <dig> test data set . to test the ability of the hmms to accurately identify bhlh containing sequences, the complete proteomes of magnaporthe oryzae, arabidopsis thaliana, and homo sapiens were scanned and compared to bhlh annotations from interpro . using the appropriate kingdom specific hmm,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bhlh sequences were identified in m. oryzae, a. thaliana, and h. sapiens respectively. within m. oryzae, the fungal hmm identified  <dig> bhlh sequences, the same set available with bhlh annotations from interpro. the a. thaliana scan with the plant hmm identified  <dig> sequences, including  <dig> sequences out of  <dig> annotated by interpro. of the  <dig> bhlh sequences identified by the plant hmm,  <dig> were classified as plant by cva{all}. the h. sapiens analysis had the largest gap with interpro, with interpro identifying  <dig> sequences the animal hmm did not. however, of those  <dig>  only  <dig> were classified as animal by cva{all},  <dig> had fewer than  <dig> amino acids, and  <dig> had been deleted as a valid entry in uniprot. of the three model organisms scanned, h. sapiens had the fewest sequences classified correctly with only 84%.

scanning of the sargasso sea environmental sample resulted in the identification of  <dig> sequences which were uniquely assigned to being of plant , animal , or fungal  origin by the kingdom specific hmms . eight sequences were found by more than one kingdom model, all of which were also identified by interpro . although more than a third of the  <dig> sequences could not be assigned by our classification models, where an assignment could be made, the models largely supported kingdom origin assigned by the hmm. for example,  <dig> of  <dig> sequences identified by the animal hmm were assigned as animal by cva{all}. blast analysis of the  <dig> sequences returned only  <dig> that had a significant match  to a bhlh protein. these findings suggest that our hmms are useful, in combination with our classification models, for determining the origin of bhlh domains in complex samples.

discussion
using a decision tree, swda and cva models, we found that only a few amino acid sites were necessary to classify bhlh domains by kingdom. in the decision tree, only sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were needed to accurately classify sequences as plant, animal or fungal. however, decision trees have many solutions and therefore do not always identify discerning sites. thus, we used discriminant analysis. swda and cva were performed on the numerically  transformed bhlh data, which revealed  <dig> highly discerning sites in common,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . it is noteworthy that four of the five sites are in the basic region and all  are known to contact either the phosphate backbone or the dna based on animal bhlh crystalline structures  <cit> . from figure  <dig>  we also observed that the group entropies at these sites were distinct. for example, site  <dig> was highly conserved in animals and fungi, but more variable in plants. these differences in conservation were characteristic of all highly discerning sites shared by cva and swda.

as shown in table  <dig>  cva typically identified discerning sites more readily than swda. for example, cva, but not swda, identified a set of  <dig> amino acid sites spanning helix  <dig> and helix  <dig> that were highly discerning. sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were each determined to be discriminating by cva{all}, and by at least one of the other cva models. each of these sites is important to the molecular architecture of the bhlh as buried sites within the helices. they are crucial for dimerization and partner specificity  <cit> . we also observed that each site was moderately to highly conserved in plants, animals, and fungi. however differences in the degree of conservation between the kingdoms were not clearly evident at each of these sites. our findings suggest that the cva model is more sensitive than swda to variations of conservation. one possible explanation for the lack of sensitivity of the swda model is that swda considers each site separately, whereas cva considers all sites simultaneously.

we established that the decision tree, swda and cva models were highly accurate using the model data set . on the test dataset, the decision tree’s accuracy fell by more than 12% for animals and fungi, but remained high for plants. swda{all} accuracy also declined by 8% for animals and fungi, while improving for plants. last, cva{all} exhibited this same behavior, however the drop in accuracy for animals and fungi was only about 4%. as expected, accuracies declined using the test dataset, but overall remained high, particularly for plants.

the discrepancy in accuracies between the tests may be due to underrepresentation of animal and fungal organisms in the model dataset. fungal sequences in the model dataset only included bhlh proteins from completed genome projects, encompassing the ascomycota and basidiomycota phylums. other phylums, such as zygomycota and chytridiomycota, were not represented in the fungal model dataset. model animal sequences, obtained from published work, are known to be highly representative of higher order metazoans. however, this set of animal model bhlh domains lacks sequences from ancestral  organisms. the higher accuracies for plants using the test dataset may reflect a lack of variation in the available sequences, in particular a lack of sequences from algae, as evidenced by the inability to classify an algae sequence in the environmental sample . upon further examination, this sequence was quite distant from any group. indeed, the mahalanobis distance between this sequence and the centroid for plants, fungi or animals was greater than the distance between centroids. it is likely this sequence may have been classified as plant if more algae sequences were available to incorporate into the model dataset.

from our testing of classification models, it was evident that cva{all} was the most accurate of all the analyses . however, cva{all} does not tolerate missing data , and could not classify nearly 7% of the test sequences. since swda{all} requires less discerning sites, it was more tolerant of missing data, classifying  <dig> sequences that cva could not. thus, even with lower accuracies, swda is the preferable classification model in instances of missing data.

accuracy measurements established the effectiveness of the classification models. however, the cva and swda models are not simply designed to classify sequences, but they elucidate the underlying architecture of the bhlh domain  . other classification methods, such as phylogeny or blast based methods, may accurately classify sequences to correct kingdom origin as we report here . while cva{all} and besthit blast are highly accurate, blast ignores the fundamental attributes of the bhlh domain. furthermore, cva and swda models have been used to classify highly divergent sequences that blast had failed to identify   <cit> .

the models we have developed are valuable for identification of bhlh domains of unknown origins within large datasets, such as an environmental sample . using interpro scan, only  <dig> bhlh sequences were identified. however,  <dig> additional bhlh sequences were identified by our kingdom specific hmms,  <dig> of which were classified into kingdom of origin with two lines of evidence . on the other hand, blast analysis only retrieved  <dig> of these sequences, again highlighting another advantage of using models rather than sequence similarity for identifying bhlh sequences. one explanation for finding  <dig> additional sequences using the kingdom specific hmms, in contrast to interpro scan, is that variation between the kingdoms has been partitioned out. thus, the interpro model may be considered too generalized, resulting in lower probability scores for diverse bhlh sequences.

cva{all} with the  <dig> kingdom specific hmm selection and the  <dig> interpro scan selections, classified twice  as many animal and plant sequences as fungal . this may be due to the sample containing fewer fungal organisms or may be a reflection of the sampling technique used to collect the sample . marine fungi are uncommon in open sea water, being typically associated with substrata such as submerged timbers and organic rich sediment  <cit> .

the environmental sample contained  <dig>  *  <dig> protein sequences, yet our scans only found 10– <dig> contain the bhlh domain. this is likely due to a combination of many factors, including; 1)  <dig>  *  <dig> sequences contained less than  <dig> amino acids, 2) sequencing and assembly errors, 3) incorrect translations of dna, and 4)  <dig> μm filter removing the majority of organisms that are represented in the model building set.

in addition to the utility of the kingdom specific models for scanning environmental samples, they also identify additional bhlh sequences within genomes. we identified an additional  <dig> bhlh sequences within homo sapiens and  <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana . cva{all} provided further evidence of correct kingdom origin for all the sequences from arabidopsis thaliana and  <dig> from homo sapiens. furthermore, our findings strongly suggest that other organisms may contain unidentified bhlh proteins. thus, it is likely that our models will identify previously unreported bhlh sequences in characterized genomes.

it is important to note that our classification models will only classify sequences as plant, animals or fungi. posterior probabilities provided by the models may potentially be misleading as these are the probability a sequence is either plant, animal or fungal given those are the only options. thus, bhlh sequences from other kingdoms, such as chromista  and protozoa  will be misclassified as either being plant, animal, or fungal. therefore, it is prudent to examine the mahalanobis distance to determine classification strength. these kingdoms were not included in this work as they do not have enough bhlh sequences to adequately train a discriminant model. however, as additional bhlh sequences become available with the recent onslaught of genome projects, inclusion of additional kingdoms in the model would likely increase the effectiveness of environmental sample classification.

from figure  <dig>  we can easily note the differences in conservation of the bhlh domain between the kingdoms, especially in the basic region. based on the consensus sequence alone, it is evident that plants have a more variable basic region, while animals and fungi are more conserved  <cit> . also, fungi have greater conservation at sites 9– <dig> than either plants or animals. differences in conservation are evident in helix  <dig> and helix  <dig> as well, with the most dramatic occurring at site  <dig> where plants are much less conserved. these differences are important to note as they suggest differences kingdom level selection pressure on this domain. previous work done by atchley et. al.  <cit>  found different patterns of selection on animal binding groups. additionally, sailsbery et. al.  <cit>  found varying selection patterns on fungal groups that correlated directly with taxonomy. thus, we find the most likely explanation for our highly discerning and biologically meaningful amino acid sites are that there exist majority kingdom specific selective pressure that is evidenced in their bhlh architecture.

CONCLUSIONS
discriminant analyses can directly associate biologically meaningful amino acid sites with apriori defined groups , when those analyses are built from factor score transformed peptides. in this manner they can be used to elucidate the underlying architecture of proteins of interest. such models can also be used to classify large sets of highly divergent data quickly and accurately. we leveraged both of these strengths in our work. we were able to identify slightly divergent sites, each tied directly to the architecture of the bhlh domain, differentiated by kingdom, across vast distances of evolutionary time. furthermore, we demonstrated that our classification models, in conjunction with kingdom specific hmms, quickly and accurately classified sequences from large datasets, such as unknown bhlh sequences from an environmental sample. furthermore, our models identified additional unreported bhlh domains within characterized genomes. all models and data have been incorporated into an open source online tool at http://www.fungalgenomics.ncsu.edu.
