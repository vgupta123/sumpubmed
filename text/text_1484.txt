BACKGROUND
glucagon is a  <dig> - amino acid hormone that is secreted by the α cells of the pancreas. glucagon works in concert with insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis and acts to stimulate hepatic glucose production in response to hypoglycemia. the glucagon receptor is a 7-transmembrane spanning g-protein-coupled receptor that is coupled to gs and activates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular levels of camp. in turn, this leads to activation of glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. glucagon increases glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and decreases glycogenesis and glycolysis in a concerted fashion via multiple mechanisms  <cit> .

mice lacking the glucagon receptor gene  exhibit a phenotype of improved glucose tolerance with decreased glucose levels under both fed and fasted conditions compared to control mice, but they do not have overt hypoglycemia under these conditions. the mice appear normal, reach normal body weight, and have normal plasma insulin levels, but display elevated circulating glucagon levels and modestly elevated plasma cholesterol in both the fed and fasted state  <cit> . evaluation of the liver profile revealed similar liver weights between the control and the gcgr -/- animals. however, in the fed but not fasted state, hepatic glycogen levels increase by 65%, suggesting the gcgr-/-mice do not mobilize glycogen as efficiently as wild-type or favor glycogenesis  <cit> . other phenotypic changes in the gcgr-/- mice include reduced adiposity and pancreatic α-cell hyperplasia  <cit> . it is known that liver glucose metabolism serves a critical role in whole body glucose homeostasis with metabolism of glucose being primarily by glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid  cycle. while the gcgr-/- mice have been well-characterized physiologically, we performed a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the liver of these animals, as well as metabolic profiling of the plasma, to more thoroughly understand the consequence of glucagon receptor ablation at the molecular level. major biological alterations were seen in gcgr-/- animals affecting carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein metabolism with many of the pathways being affected at both the mrna and protein level.

RESULTS
transcriptomic and proteomic analysis
there were eight animals in both the gcgr-/- and wild-type cohorts. five animals from each group were selected for transcript profiling based on their rna quality. no outliers were found during principal component analysis  and correlation mapping analysis . for proteomics analysis, seven animals from each group were randomized then analyzed using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation  platform . a qc analysis by pca and manual screening for blood proteins such as hemoglobin indicated significant blood contamination in wild-type animals m <dig> and m <dig> ; therefore, these animals were omitted from differential expression analysis. the threshold for significance was a false discovery rate  <  <dig>  for both the transcript and protein data. from the transcript analysis,  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed in the livers of gcgr-/- versus their wild-type littermates. from the protein analysis,  <dig> proteins were identified as differentially expressed.

gene ontology  analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic profiling data
to gain an understanding of the biological alterations in liver of gcgr-/- mice compared to wild-type, we examined transcriptomic and proteomic data using go and traditional pathway analysis  <cit> . both the transcript and protein results were imported into the go tools amigo , ingenuity pathway analysis, and genego metacore™. enrichments in similar biological processes and pathways were observed in all cases. the top biological processes enriched using amigo are summarized in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> mapped to "metabolic process", reflecting a  <dig> % representation versus a  <dig> % background frequency. under metabolic process ontology, several key energy metabolic processes were enriched in the transcriptomic dataset, including carbohydrate metabolism , lipid metabolism , and protein metabolism . similar enrichment in metabolic processes was found in the proteomic dataset. overall, the representation frequency in these metabolic pathways by proteins is higher than that by mrna, which is likely due to bias of proteomic technology toward detecting highly expressed proteins such as metabolism-related enzymes in the liver.

although there is high consensus in go analysis between the transcriptomic and the proteomic data, only  <dig> of the  <dig> altered proteins overlapped with the  <dig> altered genes . this is a well-observed phenomenon caused by differences in detection sensitivity and profiling scope between transcriptomic and proteomic technologies, and disparity in the regulation and kinetics of mrnas versus proteins. nevertheless, for the  <dig> proteins and genes that overlap, there is a high correlation in their expression changes .

alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in gcgr-/- mouse liver
a detailed pathway analysis revealed that key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism have altered expression at both the mrna and protein levels in the liver of knockout animals. as shown in table  <dig>  genes related to glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, such as glucan , branching enzyme  <dig>  and glycogen phosphorylase , were up-regulated, indicating an increased flux in glycogen metabolism. many genes central to the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis had altered expression, as well. glucokinase  mrna, enolase  protein, and pyruvate kinase  protein were all up-regulated to a greater or lesser extent, indicating activation of liver glycolytic pathway in gcgr-/- mice. in contrast, two key enzymes catalyzing gluconeogenesis, fructose bisphosphatase  <dig>  mrna/protein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig>  mrna were significantly down-regulated. in addition, many genes that convert amino acids into substrates for gluconeogenesis, such as agxt, gpt, sds, and got <dig> were down-regulated .

*involved in catalyzing amino acids for gluconeogenesis

^involved in catalyzing amino acids for ketone bodies

pyruvate, the product of glycolysis, is converted to acetyl-coa through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase. as shown in table  <dig>  mrnas for two components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  were up-regulated. meanwhile, the mrna for pyruvate dehyrogenase phosphatase catalytic subunit  <dig>  was down-regulated. interestingly, moderate down-regulation was observed in the mrna or the proteins involved in the tca cycle, including down-regulation of succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase, and a subunit of the α-keto-glutarate dehydrogenase complex. taken together, there was a significant increase in glycolysis and a decrease in acetyl-coa oxidation, leading to potential acetyl-coa buildup and de novo lipogenesis in gcgr-/- mouse liver.

alterations in amino acid metabolism in the gcgr-/- mouse liver
amino acid catabolism was one of the most affected metabolic processes in the gcgr-/- liver. as shown in table  <dig>  go analysis shows that  <dig> % of the significantly changed genes map to amino acid catabolic processes, whereas the background frequency in the whole genome is only  <dig> %. interestingly, the expression of these enzymes was universally down-regulated at mrna and/or protein level in the knockout mice . as mentioned above, enzymes involved in amino acid degradation to fuel gluconeogenesis, such as agxt, gpt, got <dig>  and sds, were down-regulated. in addition, many other amino acid catabolic enzymes were down-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver, as well. for instance, expression of enzymes, such as haao, ivd and aass, which break down ketogenic amino acids into acetoacetate or acetyl-coa, are decreased . furthermore, enzymes involved in the capture and disposal of amino acid nitrogen were down-regulated. for example, the glucose-alanine cycle is primarily responsible for the transport of excessive nitrogen from muscles to the liver for urea synthesis while replenishing muscle glucose supply. a key enzyme in the glucose-alanine cycle, liver glutamic-pyruvate transaminase , converts alanine to pyruvate for oxidation or gluconeogenesis, while eliminating its amino-group for urea synthesis. in the gcgr-/- liver, gpt's expression was down-regulated at both mrna and protein level. in fact, several enzymes in the liver urea cycle, including ass <dig>  asl, arg <dig>  and slc25a <dig>  were down-regulated. one role glutamine plays in the body is to collect and carry nitrogen from peripheral tissues to liver. liver glutaminase  <dig>  is expressed in periportal hepatocytes, where it catalyzes the release of ammonia from glutamine for urea synthesis. in the gcgr-/- liver, gls <dig> mrna was reduced by  <dig>  fold .

there are three metabolic fates for liver amino acids: oxidation for energy, conversion to glucose or ketone bodies, or as building blocks for new proteins. although the first two pathways are inhibited in the gcgr-/- liver as described above, genes related to protein synthesis, especially those encoding ribosomal proteins, are up-regulated by an average of ~ 20% . thus, there is a modest increase of protein synthesis in the gcgr-/- liver.

alterations in lipid metabolism in the gcgr-/- mice
as described above, in the gcgr-/- liver, the concentration of acetyl-coa might rise due to increased glycolysis and reduced activity of tca oxidation. accumulated mitochondrial acetyl-coa can be transported into the cytosol and utilized for de novo fatty acid  biosynthesis. interestingly, fa biosynthesis pathway appeared to be up-regulated at mrna and protein level in the knockout mice . transcripts for both the master transcription factor that regulates fa biosynthesis srebf <dig>  and its chaperone protein, scap, were increased significantly. in addition, the rate-limiting enzymes for fa biosynthesis, acetyl-coa carboxylase α and ß , which catalyze the synthesis of malonyl-coa from acetyl-coa, were up-regulated by  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold, respectively . the multifunctional enzyme fa synthase , which catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-coa and malonyl-coa, also was up-regulated at both the mrna and protein level. furthermore, the malic enzyme , which catalyzes cytosolic malate to pyruvate and generates nadph for fa synthesis, was up-regulated significantly. other notable enzymes that were up-regulated include: elovl  <dig>  which extends palmitate  to stearate , scd <dig>  which catalyzes the first step in synthesis of oleate  from stearate, and acot  <dig> and  <dig>  which hydrolyze acyl-coas to their corresponding free fas . interestingly, elovl  <dig> and  <dig>  which catalyze the elongation of very long fas in the endoplasmic reticulum, are down-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver. of note, although not changed at the transcript level, the citrate lyase protein, which converts mitochondria-originated citrate to acetyl-coa for lipid synthesis in cytoplasm, showed moderate up-regulation .

fas are catabolized into acetyl-coa mainly through ß-oxidation in the mitochondria. the rate-limiting step for fa oxidation lies in the transport of activated fas  into the mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyltransferase  <dig> and  <dig> . in the gcgr-/- liver, these two enzymes were down-regulated moderately . fas with aliphatic tails longer than  <dig> carbons are first shortened in peroxisomes before being catabolized into acetyl-coa in the mitochondria. surprisingly, several peroxisome ß-oxidation enzymes, such as acaa <dig>  slc27a <dig>  and acox <dig>  were up-regulated moderately at the protein level in the gcgr-/- liver . interestingly, expression of the vldl receptor and lipoprotein lipase , which are involved in fa uptake by peripheral tissues, were up-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver . it would be worthwhile to check if these genes are also up-regulated in other tissues in future studies.

as acetyl-coa is also the substrate for de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, we investigated whether this pathway was dysregulated in the gcgr-/- liver. as shown in table  <dig>  several key enzymes in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, including acat <dig>  hmgcs, hmgcr, pmvk, idi <dig>  fdps, and lss, were all up-regulated between  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold at the transcript level. as mentioned above, scap, which is involved in sterol-dependent post-translational regulation of srebp activity, was up-regulated at the transcript level, although expression of srebp <dig>  the master transcription factor controlling cholesterol biosynthesis, was unchanged . in addition, the cholesterol esterification enzyme, sterol o-acyltransferase <dig> , was up-regulated by ~  <dig> fold. furthermore, transcripts for the heterodimeric transporter abcg-5/ <dig>  which is responsible for transferring cholesterol to canalicular bile, was up-regulated. other notable genes involved in cholesterol transport, such as abcg <dig>  npc <dig>  ca <dig>  apoa <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and scarb <dig>  were up-regulated, as well .

bile acids  are synthesized from cholesterol through multiple enzymatic steps  <cit> . expression of the key enzymes in this pathway did not show consistent changes at either transcript or protein level. as seen in table  <dig>  cyp27a <dig> and cyp39a <dig> showed moderate up-regulation, cyp7b <dig> and cyp8b <dig> were down-regulated, but the rate-limiting enzyme cyp7a <dig> was unchanged . several ba transporters showed upregulation at the transcript level in the gcgr-/- liver. slc10a <dig> , which reabsorbs bas from the portal vein, was slightly up-regulated. abcb <dig>  and abcc <dig>   which excrete bas into the canalicular bile, were up-regulated moderately. interestingly, abcc <dig>  which secretes bas into systemic circulation as an alternative pathway, was up-regulated almost 7-fold. ostβ and abcc <dig>  two other efflux transporters involved in the alternative secretion pathway, were up-regulated, as well .

metabolomic profiling of the gcgr-/- mouse plasma
plasma samples from the nine gcgr-/- mice and nine wild-type littermates were analyzed by targeted lc/ms/mrm profiling to identify changes in up to  <dig> small molecule metabolites. as seen in table  <dig>  the most dramatically changed category of metabolites belonged to that of amino acids and their derivatives. the concentrations of  <dig> amino acids in the plasma of knockout animals were increased by  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold. the levels of arginine and cysteine derivatives and urea cycle intermediates also were increased significantly in the plasma. some nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives showed increased concentrations, as well.

glycerol and several metabolites in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, including glycerate-2-p, glycerate-3-p, and phosphoenolpyruvate, showed decreases of ~  <dig> fold in plasma concentration. as reported previously  <cit> , plasma glucose level decreased by  <dig> -fold. plasma udp-glucose, an activated form of glucose that is involved in the glycosyltranferase reactions in metabolism, decreased in parallel.

finally, the levels of two bile acids, cholic acid and glycocholic acid, were increased dramatically  in the gcgr-/- plasma .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
glucagon signaling is a major counterregulatory hormone to insulin. it promotes glycogenolysis and stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver, resulting in higher glucose output to the blood stream. in many t2dm patients, in addition to insulin signaling deficiency, glucagon secretion has been found to be abnormally elevated due to dysregulation, exasperating t2dm symptoms and progression  <cit> . thus, attenuating glucagon signaling may provide a sound strategy to manage t2dm. indeed, in preclinical studies, inhibition of the glucagon receptor with antagonistic small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, or antisense oligonucleotides leads to reduced plasma glucose, improved insulin sensitivity, and improved glucose tolerance  <cit> . furthermore, genetic knockout of the mouse gcgr by homologous recombination resulted in significant reduction of blood glucose, improvement in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and resistance to diet-induced obesity  <cit> . whereas these data provided strong rationale for targeting gcgr as a treatment of t2dm, some side effects have also been observed in mice with severe disruption of glucagon signaling, including increased plasma cholesterol concentration and enlarged pancreas due to α-cell hyperplasia . this is not unexpected as glucagon, in countering insulin, normally promotes expression of gluconeogenesis pathway genes and inhibits those of glycolytic pathway. the severe inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis and the modest increase of liver glycolysis likely contributed most to the improved glucose control in gcgr-/- mice that has been published previously  <cit> . the mrna of enzymes involved in glycogenesis were modestly increased as expected from loss of gcgr signaling, but paradoxically, the genes and proteins involved in glycogenolysis were also up-regulated .

an important observation in the current study is the wide-spread reduction of transcripts and proteins of enzymes involved in amino acid catabolism in the gcgr-/- liver . these include enzymes responsible for converting amino acid carbon skeletons into substrates for gluconeogenesis and ketone body production, e.g. agxt, gpt, aass, and haoo. protein synthesis-related genes, on the other hand, were up-regulated only modestly at the transcriptional level in the gcgr-/- liver . as a result, blood concentration of amino acids and their derivatives increased significantly . whereas the scope and degree of the transcriptional dysregulation of amino acid metabolism in the current study were surprising, this could be attributed to the net effect of up-regulating insulin action while down-regulating glucagon action in the knockout mice. it is a well known fact that glucagon promotes, while insulin inhibits, amino acid catabolism to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, or direct energy source by oxidation. such gross regulation of these enzymes at the transcriptional level, by either insulin or glucagon, has not been published previously. in fact, transcriptional regulation of amino acid catabolism has not been completely illustrated as these pathways are chiefly regulated by substrate availability and allosteric mechanisms  <cit> . the dramatic transcriptional alterations of these pathways may reflect an adaptive response to innate loss of glucagon signaling in the gcgr-/- liver. further studies are needed to understand the complex regulatory mechanism leading to these changes.

another important observation in this study relates to altered lipid metabolism in the gcgr-/- liver. there is a marked increase of transcripts and proteins for the key enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways of fatty acids and cholesterol . as a classical function of insulin, in opposition to glucagon, is to promote fatty acid synthesis from excessive glucose  <cit> , it is consistent that fatty acid biosynthesis is up-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver where insulin signaling dominates. multiple lines of evidence have indicated that the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein -1c mediates insulin-induced stimulatory effect on fatty acid biosynthesis genes  <cit> . indeed, our data showed that the transcripts for srebp- <dig> and its chaperone srebp cleavage-activating protein  were both up-regulated  <dig>  fold in the gcgr-/- liver .

as alluded to above, transcripts of key genes involved in the de novo cholesterol biosynthesis such as hmg coa reductase were increased for ~  <dig> fold  in the gcgr-/- liver. the expression of these genes has been shown to be controlled by the transcription factor srebp <dig> in a sterol-dependent manner  <cit> . in contrast to srebp <dig>  expression of srebp <dig> has not been shown to be regulated by insulin or glucagon  <cit> . this observation is confirmed in the current study as srebp <dig> transcript was unchanged in the knockout mice . srepb <dig> is synthesized first as inactive precursor bound to the er membrane via two transmembrane domains. upon cholesterol depletion, it is escorted by the cholesterol-sensing and escorting protein scap to the golgi apparatus, where the n-terminal domain is released from the membrane via proteolysis. the n-terminal domain, designated as nsrebp <dig>  then translocates to nucleus and activates the transcription of its target genes  <cit> . as noted above, scap expression is up-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver . thus, even though the level of full-length srebp <dig> is not changed in these hepatocytes, more nsrepb <dig> could be generated and translocated to the nucleus, where it could stimulate the transcription of key cholesterol synthesis genes. further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism underlying the gross transcriptional upregulation of cholesterol synthesis pathway in the gcgr-/- liver.

in addition to the transcriptional up-regulation, fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in the gcgr-/- liver may also be boosted by the potential accumulation of their common substrate acetyl-coa, due to increased glycolysis, reduced oxidation via the tca cycle, and inhibited gluconeogenesis . furthermore, our data showed that enzymes regulating mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids were down-regulated at the transcriptional level, which is in line with a recently published biochemical study of fatty acid oxidation using 1-14c-palmitate labeling in the knockout mice  <cit> . taken together, one would expect the plasma levels of free fatty acids , tg, and cholesterol to rise in gcgr-/- mice. indeed, several publications, as well as our data , have shown that plasma cholesterol and/or ldl-c increase significantly in the knockout mice  <cit> . with regard to blood levels of ffa and tg, earlier reports indicated that there was little change in gcgr-/- mice compared to the wild-type littermates under fed or fasted condition . however, a recent study by longuet and colleagues demonstrated that under prolonged fasting , plasma ffa, tg, and liver vldl secretion all rose significantly in gcgr-/- mice  <cit> . this discrepancy merits further study.

a surprising finding in the current study is the highly elevated level of cholic acid and glycocholic acid in the blood of gcgr-/- mice . bile acids  are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes through a multistep enzymatic process and are secreted into the bile via the bile salt export pump abcb <dig>  bas are released from the gall bladder into the intestinal lumen upon feeding to facilitate digestion of lipids. the majority of secreted bas are reabsorbed efficiently into portal blood by specific transporters in the terminal ileum, and then taken up by hepatocytes through the action of basolateral uptake transporters, thus fulfilling an "enterohepatic cycle"  <cit> .

although the transcription of critical genes involved in liver ba synthesis, such as the rate-limiting enzyme cyp7a <dig>  were not up-regulated in the gcgr-/- liver , ba production most likely increased in these mice owing to elevated level of cholesterol, the substrate for ba synthesis. ba excretion to the canalicular bile and uptake from the portal vein is predicted to increase moderately based on up-regulation of the transporter genes associated with these processes . hepatic bas can be secreted to the systemic circulation via alternative basolateral efflux transporters and disposed of in urine  <cit> . in adaptive response, this alternative secretive pathway is up-regulated dramatically in mice when hepatic bas accumulate as a result of bile duct ligation or suppression of abcb <dig> expression in fxr knockout mice  <cit> . interestingly, three of these alternative efflux transporters: abcc <dig>  abcc <dig>  and ostβ are up-regulated by  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  fold at the transcript level, respectively, in gcgr-/- mice . as a result, ba excretion to the systemic circulation via these alternative transporters could increase dramatically in these mice, leading to the higher plasma level of bas observed . thus, in gcgr-/- mice, hepatic ba production probably rises due to increased cholesterol synthesis, and ba excretion to bile and urine via blood is predicted to increase in adaptive responses.

it has been reported that plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide- <dig> , as well as glucagon, were significantly elevated in gcgr-/- mice  <cit> . the increase in circulating glp <dig> was caused, at least partly, by increased production and processing of the preproglucagon mrna from hyperplasic alpha cells in these animas  <cit> . as bas were recently found to be able to stimulate glp <dig> secretion from enteroendocrine cells via the tgr <dig> receptor  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that elevated bas may partially contribute to the increase of plasma glp <dig> in these animals. further studies are warranted to investigate this possibility as well as potential effects of elevated bas on glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and thermogenesis.

in summary, genetic knockout of the glucagon receptor in mice brought about significant metabolic changes in the liver. these include up-regulation of glycolysis, severe inhibition of gluconeogenesis and amino acid degradation, marked reduction of plasma glucose, and increased levels of plasma amino acids. meanwhile, there is evidence indicating the up-regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways and bile acid generation in these mice. in assessing the significance of these findings to anti-gcgr therapies for t2dm, we are mindful of the limitations to the current study. first, the tissues were collected for analysis when the animals were in the fed state. as many transcripts and proteins were likely turned over rapidly in response to fasting and feeding, our observation might not reflect the full metabolic status that exists in the fasted state. while glucagon signaling may contribute to the metabolic disorder in t2dm throughout the day, its most profound effects are thought to occur in the postprandial state. second, our findings reflect the profound metabolic changes in animals with genetic ablation of the gcgr, while pharmaceutical inhibition of gcgr is unlikely to result in a complete and constant blockade of gcgr signaling. as inhibition of the glucagon signaling pathway presents an attractive therapeutic strategy for t2dm, the challenge will be to design drugs with optimal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that render glucose-lowering benefits while avoiding the potential side effects of lipogenesis.
