BACKGROUND
neuromodulators can produce a multitude of different effects depending on context, timescale, and concentration. da, for example, has actions on the scale of milliseconds, during error detection  <cit> , to minutes and hours with its effects on volitional movement and cognition  <cit> . in most systems, da transmission is both tonic and phasic  <cit> . using the stomatogastric nervous system  in the spiny lobster, panulirus interruptus, we recently demonstrated that these two types of transmissions can act over distinct time scales to produce opposing effects on the same cell type  <cit> .

the stns comprises several motor networks and has long served as an ideal model system for studies of neuromodulation  <cit> . the pyloric circuit is a 14-neuron network located exclusively within the stomatogastric ganglion  that is modulated by da  <cit> . the stns dopaminergic system is well defined  <cit> . l-cells within the commissural ganglia  secrete da into the hemolymph  <cit> . since the stg resides in a blood vessel and is bathed by hemolymph  <cit> , this neurohormonal da serves as a source of tonic da transmission to pyloric neurons, predicted to be in the pm-nm range  <cit> . in addition, modulatory da projection neurons in the cogs use volume transmission whereby da is released into open synapses and diffuses to its target sites before reuptake  <cit> . in other systems volume transmission results in tonic nm da in the extracellular space that can rise to μm levels near the release sites of bursting da neurons  <cit> . da receptors are divided into two broad classes, type  <dig>  and type  <dig> . the lobster genome contains two d1rs and one d2r  <cit> . these receptors signal through canonical pathways in the native system  <cit>  and behave exactly like their mammalian counterparts when expressed in human embryonic kidney cells  <cit> .

in order to better understand the roles of tonic and phasic da transmissions, we have examined the effects of nm vs. μm da on identified pyloric neurons. the data suggest tonic and phasic da have distinct roles because the two concentrations produced opposing persistent vs. immediate effects on ia, respectively  <cit> . the channels mediating ia are encoded by the shal  gene in crustaceans  <cit> . ia is active at sub-threshold voltages, and helps determine the rate of post-inhibitory rebound and spike frequency in pyloric neurons  <cit> .

there is one lateral pyloric neuron  in the pyloric circuit that expresses d1rs but not d2rs  <cit> . pyloric neurons show spontaneous, rhythmic oscillations in membrane potential and burst firing . a 10 min bath application of nm da has no immediate effect on neuronal output, but bath application of μm da immediately alters lp activity , including an increase cycle frequency, a decrease burst duration, and a phase advance mediated, in part, by decreasing lp ia <cit> . the threshold for this action is ~ μm  <cit>  and is therefore likely mediated by low affinity d1rs. whereas nm da has no immediate effect, it can act at high affinity lp d1rs to persistently alter lp ia: a 1 hr application of  <dig> nm da followed by 3 hr wash produced a persistent ~25% increase in lp ia gmax relative to controls that did not receive da  <cit> .

the signaling pathways that transduce da’s immediate and persistent effects appear to be distinct. similar to the situation in mammals  <cit> , lobster d1rs can couple with gs and gq  <cit> . the immediate decrease in lp ia was mediated by a d1r-ac-camp-pka dependent pathway  <cit> . the pathway mediating the da-induced persistent increase in lp ia is unknown, but it is both translation- and mtor-dependent  <cit> . several intracellular signaling pathways can modulate the activity of the serine-threonine kinase, mtor  <cit> . the goal of this work was to understand the dose and time dependencies and the signaling proteins involved in the da-induced, persistent increase in lp ia. here we show that dopaminergic tone regulates ia density through the d1r-pka axis, erk and mtor.

RESULTS
the persistent effect is both time and dose dependent
we previously showed that a 1 hr application of  <dig> nm and 5 μm da both produced a ~25% increase in lp ia gmax measured 4 hr after da washout  <cit> . the fact that both doses produced equivalent responses suggested that da was acting at high affinity receptors. here we further examined the dose dependency of the response using two da concentrations . after dissection and cell identification, a 2-5 hr process, a given concentration of da was or was not  bath applied to the stg for 1 hr, and lp ia was immediately measured at the end of the application, before da washout using two-electrode voltage clamp  . data for each time point was normalized by the mean control value. lp ia gmax was significantly increased in  <dig> pm and  <dig> nm, relative to control preparations  . in another series of experiments,  <dig> pm da was also applied , but was not significantly different than control, and was dropped from subsequent time points. voltage dependencies were not altered by any concentration of da tested .

we next examined if the effect persisted upon da washout. experiments were repeated for control,  <dig> pm and  <dig> nm preparations. da or saline  was applied for 1 hr and then da was washed out for 1 hr, 4 hr, or 18 hrs followed by tevc in blocking saline  to measure lp ia . data for each experiment were normalized by the mean for control at that time point. control means varied less than 10% between 1 hr and 18 hr. after a 1 hr da washout , the effect of  <dig> pm da on lp ia gmax was no longer significant, whereas the significant increase produced by  <dig> nm da was sustained  . after a 4 hr da washout  average lp ia gmax decreased to control levels in the  <dig> pm treated preparations but remained significantly elevated in the  <dig> nm treated preparations compared to control . ia gmax remains elevated out to 18 hrs after da administration  <cit>  .

the previous experiments revealed that the persistent effect of nm da was observable, compared to controls, by 1 hr after the start of da administration. to examine the time course for the development of the da mediated increase in ia we measured ia repeatedly during a 1 hr  <dig> nm da or saline  application . to more carefully examine changes over time, we normalized all the values to t =  <dig>  ). we then performed mixed-model repeated measures anova with time as the within-subjects factor and treatment  as the between-subjects factor. there was a significant effect of treatment , but not of time . post hoc comparisons, with dunn-sidak adjustments, revealed significant differences between treatments at 60 min  . by 60 min, average ia gmax increased by ~10%, in da-treated preparations and decreased by ~13% in control preparations.

the persistent effect is mediated by increased camp
our next goal was to identify signaling molecules involved in the da-induced, mtor- and translation-dependent, persistent increase in lp ia. lp exclusively expresses d1rs  <cit> , of which there are  <dig> types that couple with gs  or gs & gq   <cit> . to first examine whether the persistent effect on lp ia was mediated by camp, we applied the camp analogue, 8-bromo-camp or saline  for 1 hr followed by a 1 hr block and tevc to measure lp ia . we used the lowest effective dose reported in this system  <cit> . application of 8-bromo-camp significantly and persistently elevated lp ia gmax by 40% compared to saline controls , while voltage dependence was not affected . interestingly, the magnitude of the increase in lp ia gmax produced by 8-bromo-camp was very similar to that produced by  <dig> nm da in the 2 hr experimental paradigm . to determine if the camp mediated persistent increase in lp ia depended upon mtor, we repeated the experiments except that the mtor antagonist, rapamycin , was co-applied with 8-bromo-camp or  <dig> nm da . we then compared those groups to saline alone or saline +  <dig> nm da . rapamycin reduced the  <dig> nm da and 8-bromo-camp induced increase in lp ia gmax  suggesting camp at least partially mediates the d1r-induced persistent increase in lp ia gmax.

camp acts through pka to increase ia gmax
there are several known downstream effectors of camp  <cit> , notably pka  <cit> , epacs  <cit> , and cyclic-nucleotide gated channels  <cit> . we first tested whether camp mediated its effects on lp ia through epac by employing the epac specific agonist, 8-pcpt-2′-o-me-camp. this camp analogue has been used successfully to differentially activate epac1/ <dig> as opposed to pka  <cit>  in a host of phylogenetically divergent animals, including crustaceans  <cit> . we applied 50 μm 8-cpt-camp or saline  for 1 hr, followed by a 1 hr wash and tevc to measure lp ia. 8-cpt-camp had no effect on lp ia gmax relative to control , suggesting that the persistent effect of da on lp ia was not mediated through epac activation. at present there are no effective antagonists for epacs.

to determine if pka mediated the d1r-induced persistent increase in lp ia gmax, we applied the specific pka antagonist, rp-camp for 1 hr with  <dig> nm da and ttx, followed by 3 hr wash and subsequent tevc . controls received the same treatment except that da was omitted. tetrodotoxin  was incorporated into these experiments because bath application of pka antagonists caused cessation of a rhythmic network output . thus, to standardize both activity and drugs across experiments,  ttx was included in all treatment groups to block rhythmic network output. previous experiments have demonstrated that co-application of ttx with da did not affect the da induced persistent increase in ia gmax <cit> . rp-camp blocked the da induced persistent increase in ia gmax .

erk activation is required for the da mediated increase in ia gmax
erk has been shown to positively regulate mtor activity through a number of mechanisms  <cit> , and erk signaling is necessary for mtor mediated, forskolin  induced, late-phase ltp  <cit> . however, depending upon the cell type, increased camp can activate  <cit>  or inhibit  <cit>  the erk signaling pathway. to test whether erk was involved in mediating the da induced persistent increase in lp ia gmax we used the indirect erk antagonists pd <dig> and u <dig>  both drugs act on the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases  immediately upstream of erk to prevent activation through phosphorylation. we co-applied either pd <dig> or u <dig> with or without  <dig> nm da for 1 hr, followed by a 1 hr block and tevc . we compared the results of each drug to saline control and da alone. both drugs blocked the da induced increase in ia: pd <dig>  figure 5b, anova f <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , dunnet’s post hoc, ctrl vs da, p <  <dig> , ctrl vs pd <dig>  n.s., ctrl vs pd98059 + da, n.s.. u <dig>  figure 5c, anova f <dig>  =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , dunnet’s post hoc ctrl vs da, p <  <dig> , ctrl vs u <dig>  n.s., ctrl vs u0126 + da, n.s.. these data show that erk activation is required for the persistent increase in ia gmax.

u <dig> affects the time constant of inactivation
shal  channels mediate ia in pyloric neurons  <cit> . shal  proteins are well conserved across species  <cit> . previous work using u <dig> has shown that it interacts directly with the rat kv <dig>  channel , causing an acceleration of inactivation of the channel  <cit> . to determine if u <dig> had a similar effect on panulirus a-type k channels, we determined the time constants of inactivation by fitting ia inactivation with a double exponential function  . we found that both fast and slow time constants were significantly different in the presence of u0126; the fast time constant was accelerated 40% by u <dig> compared to saline, while the slow time constant was lengthened by 59%. pd <dig>  which also blocked the persistent effect of da on lp ia, had no direct effect on a-channel inactivation kinetics . this work supports the findings of yuan et al., that the drug has an effect through direct interaction with the channel and that further, this effect may be present in many a-type k channels, given its presence in both mammals and crustaceans.

discussion
tonic da regulates ia in a time and dose dependent manner
we showed that dopaminergic tone influences ia density. in the absence of tonic da, average ia gmax decreased by 13% over the course of 1 hr. average ia gmax did not decrease during a 1 hr application of ≥ <dig> pm da, but dropped to control levels when da was removed. average ia gmax increased by ~10% during a 1 hr application of  <dig> nm da and the increase was sustained for at least 5 hrs after removal of da. 5 μm da produced the same persistent increase in lp ia gmax <cit> . we interpret the data to mean that dopaminergic tone acts at high affinity d1rs to persistently augment lp ia density. our findings are consistent with previous work that suggests that tonic application of modulators can regulate surface expression of ion channels  <cit> .

one interpretation of these data is that dopaminergic tone increases the ratio of the rate of shal channel insertion into versus removal from the plasma membrane. upon removal of da, the ratio will decrease, and ia will decline according to the half-life of the channel. since the da-induced increase is translation-dependent, it is tempting to speculate that da increases the pool of shal channels available for insertion. alternatively, or in addition, it is also possible that da might alter the subunit composition of the shal channels by incorporating different shal isoforms into the tetrameric channel  <cit>  or by altering auxiliary subunits that interact with the alpha subunits  <cit> , which are known to influence conductance  <cit> . it is also possible that da alters levels of proteins involved in trafficking or endocytosis of shal channels. since tevc was always performed in the presence of ttx to block activity, we cannot rule out the possibility that decreases in activity may also contribute to changes in ia gmax. indeed, both neuronal activity acting through changes in ca2+ and neuromodulators can alter camp levels in arthropods via the adenylyl cyclase, rutabaga  <cit> .

immediate and persistent regulation of ia both utilize camp-pka axis
the immediate and persistent effects of da that decrease and increase ia, respectively, are both mediated by a da activated increase in camp and pka activity  <cit> . it is unclear where the pathways diverge. lp cells express two different d1rs: d1αpan and d1rβpan  <cit> . these distinct receptors could mediate the observed high and low affinity effects. this need not be the case. receptors exist in multiprotein signaling complexes called signalplexes  <cit>  and the same receptor could be incorporated into distinct signalplexes that generate unique camp signals. it has been demonstrated that agonists acting at receptors that positively couple with camp can simultaneously generate large, temporally complex, local signals and sustained global signals  <cit> . compartmentilization of camp signaling has been demonstrated to be critical in mediating differential downstream effects of camp and preventing non-specific activity of camp effectors  <cit> . camp signals can be constrained by differential pka compartmentalization via a kinase anchoring proteins   <cit>  and/or by differential phosphodiesterase localization  <cit> . d1rs are predominately localized to terminals in fine neurites  <cit> . previous camp imaging studies on stg neurons showed that continuous application of modulators, including da, initially produced a camp signal in the terminals that eventually spread throughout the cell  <cit> . since the persistent effect is induced by continuous exposure to da, that could result in more global changes in shal channels than the immediate effect.

pka and erk contribute to the persistent increase in lp ia gmax
erk activation is required for the persistent increase in ia gmax. both mek antagonists blocked the persistent effect when co-applied with  <dig> nm da. it is not clear if erk and pka are acting in parallel or series. the intracellular signaling pathway mediating the persistent increase in lp ia shows a remarkable overlap with many proteins involved in l- <dig>  4-dihydroxyphenylalanine  induced dyskinesia   <cit> . specifically, both pathways involve a d1r mediated increase in camp, pka activation, increase in erk activity, and finally mtorc <dig> activation. lid is attenuated by pka  <cit>  and mtor antagonism  <cit> . independent dual activation of camp/pka axis and erk by d1rs has been observed in lid, where l-dopa treated gαolf deficient mice showed decreased pka phosphorylation, but no change in erk activation  <cit> . the erk pathway has multiple points of interaction with proteins affecting mtor activity  <cit> , and based on this data, it is impossible to say which protein pathways mediate this effect. interestingly, the neurotrophic factor neuritin, which also increases ia  in a dose and time dependent manner in mammalian neurons, requires both erk and mtor  <cit> , suggesting many components of modulatory tone may act together to determine ia density.

CONCLUSIONS
da acts at high affinity receptors to increase ia gmax through a translation dependent mechanism that requires a functional d1r-pka axis, erk and mtor.
