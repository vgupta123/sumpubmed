BACKGROUND
genic microsatellites are those microsatellites based on simple sequence repeats  found within, or closely associated with, gene sequences from a given genome  <cit> . these ssrs tend to be more conserved and of different motifs than ssrs located in other non-gene containing regions of the genome, which are often referred to as genomic microsatellites simply to distinguish them from genic microsatellites  <cit> ; although both gene and non-gene derived microsatellites are obviously part of the overall genome. simple sequence repeats are defined as small stretches of repeated dna, usually of two to six nucleotides, tandemly repeated and located in a given pattern between segments of non-repeated dna  <cit> . in practice, remnant repeats can be found on either side of a stretch of ssr and in some occasions different motifs are combined together or either motif is interrupted  <cit> . this differentiates microsatellites into compound or simple microsatellites in the first case, and perfect and imperfect microsatellites in the latter case  <cit> .

common bean, phaseolus vulgaris l., is an important food legume, basic to the diet of the poor in tropical regions of the world, and a major source of income for small farmers there. genic microsatellites have been limited in number for this crop. this is perhaps due to two main reasons: 1) a lack of funding has precluded large scale expressed sequence tag  sequencing or even the sufficient construction of many cdna libraries for the crop and 2) those ests and cdna libraries that exist have not been extensively screened for gene-based ssrs with the exception of the work of blair et al.  <cit>  and hanai et al.  <cit> . yet, common bean is essential for micronutrient nutrition and is adaptable to marginal areas for small-scale farm agriculture despite problems of low phosphorus soils or other abiotic constraints  <cit>  and a range of diseases and pests  <cit> . therefore a more complete toolbox of molecular tools for this crop is needed especially in the case of gene-based markers which can be based on ssrs polymorphisms as will be discussed here.

in our efforts to accumulate a larger set of genic ssrs, we previously constructed a leaf based cdna library from andean genotype g <dig>  <cit>  and used a hybridization approach to discover ssrs of various di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide motifs and develop microsatellites from this library in the bmc  series  <cit> . we have also recently developed two additional root based cdna libraries under high and low phosphorus conditions from the mesoamerican genotype dor <dig>  the other parent of the mapping population of blair et al.  <cit>  and sequenced ests from the libraries to discover new ssrs.

the est sequencing of these libraries is used in this research as the basis for determining the frequency of ssr sequences in root expressed genes as opposed to leaf expressed genes and for adding to the bmc series of microsatellites through an in silico approach to microsatellite discovery as described by varshney et al.  <cit>  for some species of cereals. est-ssrs are more common in cereals than they are in legumes  <cit> .

apart from our efforts, currently there are approximately  <dig>  other est sequences from common bean including collections from ramirez et al.  <cit> , melotto et al.  <cit>  and thibivilliers et al.  <cit>  along with small groups of genbank entries and a wish-list of further est efforts  <cit> . however most of these libraries have not been screened nor compared for ssr markers. the melotto et al.  <cit>  libraries from anthracnose infected common bean leaves which contain together approximately  <dig>  unigenes has been screened for microsatellites, yielding a set of  <dig> est-based ssrs for hanai et al.  <cit> , although many of these have been used for genetic mapping rather than for germplasm characterization.

the objective of this research was to evaluate the frequency of microsatellites in sequences from different leaf and root est libraries made in our laboratory, comparing the types of microsatellites from each source tissue. from there we developed the most promising microsatellite loci as gene-based ssr markers that we added to the bmc series of markers  <cit> . to validate these bmc markers we compared their ability to detect polymorphism in a standard germplasm panel of  <dig> mapping parent genotypes, which included mesoamerican, andean, wild and cultivated accessions that were useful for determining polymorphism information content of the different groups of markers. a final objective was to determine whether any difference in the ability to uncover polymorphism existed between the newly developed bmc markers found in the random est sequencing versus bmc markers developed by our previous hybridization-based approach.

methods
cdna library and est sequencing
three cdna libraries were searched for microsatellite containing sequences. these libraries were based on 1) mrna from leaf and stem tissues as described in blair et al.  <cit>  and ramirez et al.  <cit>  for the genotype g19833; 2) a library that was made in the pbs-skii vector from mrnas of hydroponically grown dor <dig> roots which were produced under low phosphorus  conditions and 3) a final library also made in the pbs-skii vector from mrnas of hydroponically grown dor <dig> roots but which were from a high phosphorus  treatment.

in total,  <dig> ests were sequenced from the g <dig> leaf and stem tissue library:  <dig> sequences  from blair et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> sequences  sequenced for this study. meanwhile, a total of  <dig> ests were sequenced from the dor <dig> root tissue libraries: these being  <dig> from the hp library  and  <dig> from the lp library . clones from all cdna libraries were sequenced from the 5'end using bigdye chemistry  and di-deoxy-based sanger sequencing reactions at the clemson university genomics institute . all est sequences were screened for microsatellites to be assigned to the bmc series as described in blair et al.  <cit>  and with the methods given below.

ssr identification, primer design and microsatellite amplification
ssrs were identified by screening the est collections with ssr locator  <cit>  with the default option of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide repeats. primers were designed using primer <dig>  <cit>  with the following conditions: optimum primer length of  <dig> nucleotides , optimum melting temperature of 50°c , an optimum product size of  <dig> base-pairs  and an optimum g/c content of 50% . new markers were submitted as sts entries to genbank and are listed in the additional file  <dig> .

pcr reaction conditions for all newly designed bmc markers and for the  <dig> bmc markers from blair et al.  <cit>  are as follows:  <dig> ng of genomic dna,  <dig>  μm of mixed forward and reverse primers, 1x buffer ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig>  mm dntps and  <dig> u taq polymerase in  <dig> μl reaction volumes. amplification conditions were based on those described in blair et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> cycles and 47°c annealing temperature. pcr reaction products were run on ptc- <dig> thermal cyclers  and then denatured at 94°c and run on 4% polyacrylamide gels  in metal backed owl t-rex vertical s3s gel units  at constant  <dig> w. silver staining was performed as described in blair et al.  <cit> .

germplasm survey
the set of genotypes used for the polymorphism survey in this study was based on a germplasm panel of  <dig> genotypes described in blair et al.  <cit>  as panel i. both the dor <dig> genotype, a mesoamerican gene pool advanced line from the international center for tropical agriculture , and the g <dig> genotype, an andean gene pool peruvian landrace in the fao collection at ciat were obtained from the gene bank in the genetic resources unit , and used in a polymorphism survey since these were the sources of the est libraries we screened for microsatellite loci. along with these two genotypes the germplasm survey included nine more domesticated mesoamerican accessions and varieties , four other domesticated andean accessions or varieties  and three wild accessions  representing andean, mesoamerican and colombian wild sub-populations) which were also provided by the gru.

dna extraction consisted in a ctab based mini-prep procedure as described in afanador et al.  <cit>  using bulk leaf tissue from four greenhouse grown plants per genotype or line. since the accessions were from lines separated by seed color and maintained at the gene bank, or from advanced lines from the ciat collection, we assumed homozygosity for all the germplasm but noted any double banding that could indicate a heterozygote or heterogeneous mixture from the four plants. although beans are a highly inbreeding species  some outcrossing occurs occasionally so there can be some within accession or intra-population variation and this would be observable in any lanes containing more than one band, representing more than one allele in seeds of the accession.

data analysis
allele sizes were estimated for the survey panel and mapping gels based on comparison with  <dig> and  <dig> bp molecular weight ladders that were distributed twice on each silver stained gel. a neighbor-joining  dendogram was constructed with the proportion of shared alleles coefficient and matrix of alleles and genotypes for the survey panel with the software programs darwin  <cit> . polymorphism information content  was calculated for each marker with powermarker  <cit> .

RESULTS
comparisons of est-ssr repeat types and marker development
among the ssr motifs identified , tri-nucleotides were the most common with  <dig> out of  <dig> found  while di-nucleotide repeats were the second most common with  <dig> out of  <dig> found . meanwhile, only a few tetra-nucleotide  and penta-or hexa-nucleotide  ssrs were observed. across all the est sequencing sets the percentage of ests containing ssrs varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % with the highest number found in the first sequencing of the leaf library and the least in the second sequencing of the leaf library which may have been due to sampling differences. the numbers of ssrs per ests in the two root libraries were similar, with  <dig> % for the hp library and  <dig> % for the lp library. when comparing the leaf versus root tissues we found that  <dig> % of the leaf ests had ssrs while  <dig> % of the root ests had ssrs so the values were similar overall. more tetra-nucleotide ssrs were found in leaf ests than in root ests while the number of di-nucleotide ssrs in relationship to the number of ests sequenced was similar in the two est collections. similar numbers of tri-nucleotides were found in ests from each type of tissue.

when comparing the specific motifs for ssrs found in each set of ests  we observed similar frequencies of specific types of motifs among the di-nucleotides but different frequencies of specific types of motifs among the tri-nucleotides. overall among the di-nucleotides ag/ct/ga/tc microsatellites were much more common than other types of di-nucleotide motifs with  <dig> out of  <dig> of these ssrs . the next most common was the at/ta microsatellites with  <dig> out of  <dig> of these ssrs  while no cg/gc microsatellites were found. only four ac/gt/ca/tg microsatellites were found constituting only  <dig> % of the total di-nucleotide repeat motif ssrs identified. among the tri-nucleotide ssrs, aag/aga/gaa/ttc/tct/ctt was the most common motif with 23% of the total followed by agg/gag/gga/tcc/ctc/cct with 16%. the cgc and ata-rich microsatellites were the least common with all others being intermediate.

motifs are distinguished for di- and tri-nucleotide based simple sequence repeats  used to create new bmc markers.

1complementary sequences for a given motif are given and were the basis for grouping of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide motif ssr.

in the effort to develop additional cdna-derived microsatellites, we added  <dig> new bmc  markers to the  <dig> previously developed bmc markers  <cit> . among the microsatellites, the first seventeen  were developed from leaf cdnas in the library described in  <cit>  and as shown in the additional file  <dig> . a second set of leaf cdna derived microsatellites from our second est sequencing effort in this library were designated as bmc <dig> to bmc <dig>  meanwhile,  <dig> microsatellite markers  were developed from the hp root library and  <dig> other microsatellite markers  were developed from the lp root cdna libraries. in summary the largest number of new cdna derived microsatellites were found in the root libraries  compared to the leaf library .

among the newly developed markers  <dig> were based on di-nucleotide repeats,  <dig> on tri-nucleotide repeats and  <dig> on tetra-, penta- or hexa-nucleotide repeats which we generally avoided for primer design . the new markers produced expected product sizes from as small as  <dig> to as large as  <dig>  although the majority were designed to be small pcr amplicons to avoid the possibility of including exons. the average number of repeats in the bmc markers  was  <dig>  repeats per microsatellite but this varied from an average of  <dig>  for di-nucleotide motifs to  <dig>  for tri-nucleotide motifs and  <dig>  repeats for other tetra, penta or hexa-repeat based motifs.

bmc markers developed from leaf and root expressed sequence tags  are separately and jointly considered for number of simple sequences repeats  and percentage of total.

the highest repeat numbers were found for bmc <dig>  and bmc <dig>  as well as bmc <dig> and bmc <dig> ; all of which were based on di-nucleotide motifs; the first and last two based on gan with the second based on can. surprisingly, there were few long atn microsatellites, with the exception of bmc <dig> , but this may be due to the genic nature of the microsatellites developed. the distribution of repeat sizes among the bmc markers was skewed generally to the smaller number of repeats; the reader is reminded that the minimum number of repeats for di-nucleotides was five and for tri-nucleotides was four while for all other types it was three . interestingly, a small group of di-nucleotide microsatellites with large numbers of repeats were found to the right of the graph and greater skewing of di-nucleotide compared to tri-nucleotide microsatellites was found towards the left of the graph.

when comparing the source tissue for the bmc markers, the ratio of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide markers was similar for root and leaf derived microsatellites . these ratios held true for the proportion of markers that had problems of non-amplification  or that were multi-copy . the markers showing multiple monomorphic banding were bmc <dig>  bmc <dig>  bmc <dig>  bmc <dig>  bmc <dig>  and bmc <dig>  the ratio of simple to compound ssrs was  <dig> to  <dig> among the new bmc markers, 85% and 15% of the total number of markers, respectively. among the compound repeats many were just due to an interruption of the same repeat . therefore the percentage of truly compound repeats was even lower  corresponding to  <dig> % and the vast majority were simple, perfect motif ssrs. amplification strength was similar for ssrs of different motifs and repeat lengths .

genetic diversity detected
as described above, out of the  <dig> new bmc markers a total of  <dig> microsatellites amplified well in the survey panel and these were used for polymorphism survey for the germplasm panel and diversity analysis. in this final set of  <dig> functional markers,  <dig>  were monomorphic and  <dig>  were polymorphic. the average pic value of the new polymorphic bmc markers was  <dig>  and ranged from  <dig>  for the least polymorphic markers to  <dig>  for the most polymorphic marker .

polymorphism comparison of the di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide markers showed that they had similar average pic values  when considering both monomorphic and polymorphic microsatellites together. a similar situation was observed when considering only polymorphic microsatellites, where di- and tri-nucleotide based markers again had similar pic values . none of the tetra-, penta- or hexa-nucleotide repeat-based markers was polymorphic.

polymorphic markers were in similar proportion  for the bmc markers from leaf ests  and for the bmc markers from root ests . interestingly some polymorphic root-derived bmc markers  showed monomorphic background bands suggesting they were members of gene families with different degrees of diversity in different homologs.

a set of five microsatellites  was only polymorphic in the wild accessions but not in the cultivated accessions or varieties. these markers had relatively low pic values of  <dig>  to  <dig> . from the  <dig> current bmc markers, including the  <dig> from the previous study of blair et al.  <cit>  and the  <dig> described here, a total of  <dig>  of the bmc markers yielded monomorphic results while  <dig>  produced polymorphic results in the germplasm survey.

the average pic value of the full set  <dig> bmc microsatellites was calculated to be  <dig> , while for all those that were polymorphic the pic value was  <dig> . when the diversity analysis with the newly-developed, cdna-derived markers bmc <dig> to bmc <dig> was undertaken  we found that the andean and mesoamerican gene pools represented the main axis of the neighbor joining tree upon which two of the wild accessions then showed a divergence from the cultivated genotypes. the argentinean accession g <dig> grouped within the andean genepool, while the highly diverse colombian  and mexican  accessions were near the division of the two gene pools. these results agree with the neighbor joining analysis of blair et al.  <cit>  who evaluated the markers bmc <dig> to bmc <dig> .

when the results of the phylogeny analysis of the newly developed makers were combined with the previous markers from blair et al.  <cit>  an even clearer picture of the associations emerged . although all dendrograms showed very highly supported nodes for the separation of the two main gene pools and the two wild accessions; in the combined analysis, we found very high bootstrap values  based on the strength of the total set of markers evaluated.

discussion
the major achievements of this research were 1) to evaluate microsatellite frequency in three cdna libraries from root and leaf tissues with one of the root libraries developed for the abiotic stress of low phosphorus and 2) to create additional genic microsatellite markers based on low-level sequencing of these est libraries to use in a polymorphism survey both to understand common bean genetic diversity and to understand the differences in various microsatellite types from different sources and their ability to uncover bean diversity. the creation of new genic microsatellites is especially pressing as only about  <dig>  <cit>  had been reported before we started our work on the design of bmc microsatellite markers.

in total we have now designed  <dig> genic microsatellites in the bmc series between the efforts of this study and the previous work of blair et al.  <cit> ; all bmc markers were designed from cdna libraries made from different tissues of the mapping population parents used by blair et al.  <cit> . in addition, with this study we have created bmc markers from two different genotypes including g <dig> and dor <dig> and from leaf tissue and root tissues subjected to low or high phosphorus conditions. the advantage of having markers developed from sequences of both genotypes resides is the fact that the andean g <dig> is being used for whole-genome shotgun sequencing and the mesoamerican dor <dig> provides a commercially useful tropical, small red seeded counterpart to the andean genotype and to black beans which have been better studied in terms of agronomy as well as est development  <cit> .

in addition, both marker types from both genotype sources are useful for evaluation in the reference map based on dor <dig> × g <dig> studied by blair et al.  <cit>  which is linked both the uc-davis  <cit>  and univ. of florida  <cit>  genetic maps. in terms of the practical use of the microsatellites, the pcr amplification strength was similar for ssrs of different motifs and repeat lengths, which may be typical of gene-derived microsatellites and distinct from genomic microsatellites as first suggested by blair et al.  <cit> .

in our previous study of cdna derived microsatellites  <cit>  we found that uniformly strong pcr products were obtained with the specific primer sets around the ssr loci in cdna sequences. in comparison, amplification with non-gene based microsatellites is prone to some pitfalls as discussed by blair et al.  <cit>  for at-rich microsatellites and blair et al.  <cit>  for hybridization derived genomic microsatellites. differences between genic and different kinds of genomic microsatellites have been observed for other marker sets as well  <cit> . although the ssr and est sequencing effort from most of these projects has been small it is useful to have added their sequences to genbank to compare in the future to larger est collections from ramirez et al.  <cit> , melotto et al.  <cit>  and thibivilliers et al.  <cit>  as well as future genomic sequences for common bean or related species. furthermore the possible role of microsatellites as promoters or gene expression enhancers especially in root genes where many agn microsatellites were found could be studied.

in terms of other di-nucleotide motifs, the lack of gc microsatellites has been observed before within the bean genome  <cit> , while at-rich microsatellites were not expected to be found in genic sequences neither as di-nucleotides nor tri-nucleotides such as those studied by blair et al.  <cit> . there were only a few acn based microsatellites which was surprising given that enrichment for this motif has yielded about the same number of markers as enrichment with agn or gan based probes  <cit> . among the tri-nucleotide motifs it appears that aag , acc , agc , agg  and atc  microsatellites are the most common and this may have to do with their frequency in triplet codon use for amino acid incorporation into polypeptides. additionally, open reading frames are known to have a higher gc percentage than non-translated regions  <cit>  which might favor tri-nucleotide motifs such as acc, agc and agg. compared to the results of blair et al.  <cit>  the ratio of tri-nucleotide to di-nucleotide motifs was fairly high . perhaps this was due to a majority being located in the open reading frame rather than in untranslated regions of the original mrna transcripts represented by the cdna sequences.

in the second step of this study, we analyzed the potential of two different groups of bmc markers, one from cdna clone sequencing  and one from cdna hybridization with ssr motifs  to be used in phylogeny analysis. the full group of markers, therefore, included a total of  <dig> bmc microsatellites all evaluated against the same germplasm survey from blair et al.  <cit> . in that evaluation, genetic diversity was reliably predicted by both types of cdna based bmc microsatellites. both sets of markers were useful in separating the andean and mesoamerican genepool and accurately placing the wild accessions within each genepool. two wild accessions  were separated from the cultivated accessions. similar results were found with the same diversity panel in blair et al.  <cit> .

in summary, cdna derived markers seem to be very useful for diversity analysis due to the fact that they are derived from genic sequences that are conserved and are highly transferable between different accessions of beans. they were critical in recent studies of diversity in both dry and snap bean cultivars of phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> . therefore, in the future we plan to analyze the frequency of gene-based microsatellites in larger collections of ests such as those of ramirez et al.  <cit>  or thibivilliers et al.  <cit>  which surpass the numbers of ests evaluated in the libraries we used here. it will be interesting to see if ssr frequency is similar or different for the multiple libraries used by the first of these authors or the larger set of ests from a single rust-infected leaf library evaluated by the second research group. one lesson from this microsatellite evaluation is that it is important to test new markers for consistent patterns of genetic diversity detection. we also plan to test the gene-derived markers in related phaseolus species.

CONCLUSIONS
in terms of the evaluation of genetic diversity we found that genic microsatellites from both est sequencing and hybridization based approaches performed equally well in distinguishing andean and mesoamerican genepools and the argentinean, colombian and mexican wild beans as separate accessions. therefore, these markers can be used for diversity analysis and for breeding especially in crosses between wild and cultivated beans or between genepools. we expect that next generation sequencing will make the discovery of new transcriptome-based ssrs even easier than the two approaches used so far. nonetheless, the utility of cdna derived microsatellites for diversity analysis is well established and is perhaps best explained due to their conservation and slower rate of evolution than genomic microsatellites. in summary, gene-based or 'genic' microsatellites appear to be especially useful for genetic analysis of common bean and it would be ideal to have a larger set of these markers for functional diversity analysis and perhaps association mapping once they are genetically mapped which will be the subject of a separate manuscript to define the regions of the genome that are part of the transcriptome. finally, these gene-based markers may be the keys to selection of specific traits as they represent expressed genes some of which are likely to have multiple functional alleles with diverse phenotypes as a result. simple sequence repeats in promoter regions have sometimes been found to be important in controlling gene expression and this may be the case for some of the genic markers discovered in this study as well.
