BACKGROUND
structure-based drug design  can be an effective contributor to the identification and optimization of drug candidates by providing a structural rationale for the design of improved compounds. protein crystallization, structure determination, and the rapid determination of multiple protein/ligand complexes can be expensive and time-consuming. major variables include protein construct design, mutations, and post-translational modifications, the nature of protein impurities , the choice of ligands or even proteins for co-crystallization, and the crystallization conditions themselves. these variables represent an enormous matrix of experimental possibilities that is difficult or impossible to explore systematically. despite these challenges, the availability of structural information at the preliminary stages of a drug discovery program is critical to maximize impact. therefore, efficient methods developments, techniques and strategies to deliver structures early in a project are clearly needed.

mapkap kinase  <dig>  plays a key role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α. mk <dig> is activated by the mitogen-activated protein  kinase p <dig>  <cit> . activated mk <dig> phosphorylates a number of target proteins in immune cells resulting in cytokine production and cellular proliferation and activation. mice lacking mk <dig> are healthy and fertile, but they fail to increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il- <dig>  and ifn-γ  <cit>  in response to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide. mk <dig> knockout mice are resistant to the development of collagen-induced arthritis, a model for human rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . the catalytic activity of mk <dig> is required to mount the pro-inflammatory response  <cit> . these and related studies have attracted attention to mk <dig> as a target for the design of therapeutic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and other tnf-α-driven diseases.

although the data supporting mk <dig> as a promising drug target have been available for nearly ten years, to our knowledge there are no mk <dig> inhibitors in clinical development. many companies have initiated mk <dig> projects, but little success has been reported. anecdotally, a common problem has been that high-throughput screening for lead mk <dig> inhibitors has been unproductive. we believe sbdd targeting mk <dig> could help address this issue. yet, despite several reports of mk <dig> crystal structures at moderate  resolution  <cit> , the routine production of well-diffracting mk <dig> crystals bound to compounds of diverse structure remains difficult. more robust methods are needed to enable efficient sbdd.

the domain structure of mk <dig> may contribute to these difficulties  <cit> . its proline-rich n-terminal domain  is unique, having no counterpart in other map kinases  <cit> . this domain binds c-abl src homology  <dig> domain in vitro  <cit> . the sequence of the kinase domain  identifies mk <dig> as a ser/thr kinase family member. mk <dig> exhibits low homology to other ser/thr kinases, however, with the exception of the close homologs mk <dig> and mk <dig>  the regulatory domain at the c-terminus  contains an autoinhibitory α-helix  <cit>  followed by nuclear export signal  and nuclear localization signal  sequences  <cit> . the nes and nls are essential for mk <dig> complex formation with p <dig> and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. deletion of the entire mk <dig> regulatory domain results in a marked increase in catalytic activity  <cit> . there are three critical phosphorylation sites on mk2: thr <dig>  ser <dig>  and thr <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation at these residues activates mk <dig> by causing a conformational change in the c-terminal regulatory α-helix: on kinase activation, the helix displaces from the kinase surface and thereby allows substrates to bind  <cit> .

construct design is known to be a critical factor in producing large quantities of soluble protein and reproducible crystals. for example, it can be difficult to predict precisely domain boundaries and to identify the surface residues of globular proteins, alteration of which might enhance solubility or crystallization. altering or deleting features such as surface hydrophobicity, post-translational modifications, side-chain flexibility, secondary structural elements, or even entire domains can dramatically modulate protein physical characteristics, especially solubility. protein solubility also depends on details such as the expression vector, host cell, culture conditions, and protein fusion partner used. to increase crystallization robustness and improve crystal diffraction, we thought such wide-ranging approaches needed to be explored with mk <dig> 

here we report the optimization of several steps in human mk <dig> structure determination: rapid and systematic exploration of construct design and expression screening; high-throughput protein purification; and wide screen crystallization with customized factorial grids. our methods expand upon those of malawski et al.  <cit> , who examined only n- and c-terminal truncations of the mk <dig> catalytic domain. we took advantage of the fact that mk <dig> is one of the few kinases that expresses well in escherichia coli, which facilitates high-throughput construct design and production, to explore the effect of not only truncations but also two kinds of surface mutations and several internal deletions.

our strategy had four components: first, the n- and c-termini of the protein were varied. second, surface-exposed lysine and glutamate residues with high conformational entropy  <cit>  were mutated to drive novel crystallization contacts and thereby enhance crystallization. third, internal flexible regions were deleted, again to foster novel crystal forms. fourth, phosphorylation sites  <cit>  were altered to provide homogenous mk <dig> rather than a heterogeneous mixture of unactivated  and activated  forms.

we implemented a high-throughput, parallel approach to enable construct production, expression, and purification of all mutants within a short time, nearly all of which expressed well and were tested in customized, kinase-specific robotic crystallization screens. the methodological improvements implemented here enabled the screening of  <dig> mk <dig> constructs, resulting in seven crystal forms, diffraction testing of ~ <dig> crystals, and high-resolution data collection and structure determination of ~ <dig> mk2/inhibitor complexes.

RESULTS
we initiated mk <dig> crystallographic studies with a construct  comprising part of the proline-rich domain, the kinase and c-terminal regulatory domains, and a point mutation introduced to abolish kinase activity. mk <dig> disrupts the highly conserved catalytic lysine residue; the catalytically-inactive k93r mutation was described previously  <cit> . we began with an inactive construct because use of inactive kinases proved critical to our obtaining homogenous protein suitable for crystallography on several earlier projects. it quickly became apparent, however, that these mk <dig> constructs were not suitable for structural studies, due to both low expression levels and relative insolubility, likely due in part to the proline-rich segment. we switched to a construct that had been used to determine the first reported mk <dig> crystal structure, mk <dig>  <cit> . although protein expression and behavior improved, suitable crystals were not forthcoming, despite success in another laboratory. we believed that a new, more robust approach was clearly needed.

construct design strategy
we thus implemented a broad, four-point mk <dig> construct design strategy coupled with the high-throughput production and testing of multiple crystallographic constructs. first, we sought to parlay the domain organization of mk <dig> into a series of n- and c-terminal truncation mutants that either incorporated multiple domains of the intact protein, or defined the kinase domain more precisely than a single construct would. our approach was significantly more extensive than that of malawski et al.  <cit> . second, we mutated surface-exposed lysine and glutamate residues to alanine, to reduce the high conformational entropy of these residues  <cit> . this approach has been used successfully in a variety of contexts  <cit> . third, the flexible internal activation loop of mk <dig> was deleted. fourth, phosphorylation sites were altered to provide homogenous mk <dig> rather than a heterogeneous mixture of unactivated  and activated  forms. a representative subset of the constructs we used is shown in table 1; the complete list of constructs is also available . figure  <dig> illustrates the location of all mutation sites mapped onto the mk <dig> three-dimensional structure.

our initial construct design tactic was alteration of the n- or c-termini of full-length mk <dig>  thereby either removing flexible terminal segments that might hinder crystallization or simply providing different termini that might enable different crystal forms . this approach has been used previously by several groups, and limited systematic n- and c-terminal truncations have been explored  <cit> ; the construct used most often has been mk <dig>  a form of the enzyme noted to be constitutively-active  <cit> . given the poor behavior of the early constructs that included  the proline-rich n-terminal domain, we deleted this domain in all subsequent constructs. we explored several termini: gln <dig>  his <dig>  and arg50; and gln <dig>  leu <dig>  asp <dig>  thr <dig>  arg <dig>  asp <dig>  and his <dig> . these residues delineate the kinase domain at the n-terminus, and the kinase domain, the autoinhibitory α-helix, and the nes/nls at the c-terminus.

our second tactic addressed the protein physical characteristic of surface entropy. following longenecker and colleagues  <cit> , a series of point mutants was designed to alter flexible surface lysine and glutamate residues to minimize crystal protein entropy and entropic loss on crystallization. this approach was successfully used with rhogd <dig>  for which new crystal forms were identified that exhibited enhanced diffraction. several mk <dig> mutants in which alanine was substituted for lysine or glutamate are shown in table  <dig> . all mutants were constructed at one time, without iterative improvements.

our third tactic addressed the internal flexibility of mk <dig>  in several of the prior mk <dig> structures, the kinase activation loop  engages in significant crystal contacts. we hypothesized that deletion of this long, flexible loop  might drive formation of alternate, better-diffracting crystal lattices. we thus examined two activation loop deletions: mk <dig> and mk <dig> 

our final tactic sought to reduce the chemical and conformational heterogeneity of mk <dig>  all reported mk <dig> structures are of the unphosphorylated enzyme. previous studies had shown that mutation of phosphothreonine residues to glutamate led to constitutive activation of the kinase  <cit> . we reasoned that by altering the activation state of the protein, we would not only access a more homogeneous enzyme but also distinct conformational states, and hence increase the likelihood of useful crystal forms. the pseudoactivated mutants were based on two truncated constructs, mk <dig> and mk <dig>  glutamate mutations t222e and t334e  replaced the threonines reported to activate mk <dig> when phosphorylated. we prioritized mutation of t <dig> and t <dig> over s <dig> because existing data suggested that the threonine residues were the more significant mk <dig> phosphorylation sites  <cit> . t <dig> is shown in figure 1; t <dig> is located within the disordered portion of the activation loop.

expression, purification and crystallization
the mk <dig> constructs  were cloned using standard techniques and expressed in e. coli as glutathione s-transferase  fusion proteins. the expression plasmids encoded gst followed by thrombin and tobacco etch virus  protease cleavage sites and the desired mk <dig> sequence. it proved important to develop a method for rapid generation and screening of multiple constructs in parallel. after plasmid construction  and transformation, typically in parallel sets of 4– <dig> constructs, test expression was carried out on a small scale, to examine both yield and especially protein solubility. representative results are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  low temperature induction  provided the optimal balance between expression yield and solubility for most constructs; higher temperatures increased the proportion of insoluble protein. one pseudoactivated construct, mk <dig>  exhibited robust expression with both low and medium temperature induction; typical results are also shown in figure  <dig>  this systematic expression/solubility triage was used for all constructs. constructs that expressed at high  levels were prioritized for small-scale purification.

expression tests were conducted at three temperatures for each construct. low , medium  and high  grades were assigned to each construct based on the ratio of soluble/insoluble mk <dig> as assessed by sds-page. an example gel is shown in figure  <dig> 

routine procedures  were used to purify the mk <dig> constructs. initially, limited attempts were made to purify proteins using parallel 24-well methods . but, the rapidity with which conventional purification could be performed made the use of small-scale plate methods unnecessary. yields from the glutathione affinity chromatography capture step were 4– <dig> mg/l of culture; the parental constructs mk <dig> and mk <dig> had crude yields of  <dig> mg/l. final yields for all constructs were  <dig> – <dig> mg/l. constructs that gave the highest yields were progressed first to large-scale purification and crystallization trials; only one construct, mk <dig>  produced less than  <dig>  mg/l and therefore was not progressed. example yields for several pseudoactivated constructs are shown in table  <dig>  mk <dig> was found to be devoid of enzymatic activity, in agreement with previous reports that more than one phosphorylation is required to activate mk <dig>  <cit> . a typical example of the high purity afforded by our purification scheme is shown in figure  <dig> for mk <dig> 

forty-three of forty-four constructs produced crystals using commercial crystallization screens . the most common crystallization condition was  <dig> m 2so <dig>   <dig>  m li2so <dig>   <dig>  m caps, ph  <dig> . crystals were optimized with an emphasis on finding novel conditions. we created a customized in-house crystallization grid to optimize co-crystallization conditions for a variety of mk2/inhibitor complexes . seven crystal forms were ultimately identified ; three of these have been independently identified by other investigators: form iv  <cit> ; form v  <cit> ; and form vii  <cit> . beyond mk <dig>  we have since used this and similar grids to crystallize other kinase/inhibitor complexes.

three pseudoactivated constructs were analyzed for diffraction: mk <dig>  mk <dig>  and mk <dig> . although all yielded moderate amounts of protein and crystals suitable for diffraction testing, only one, mk <dig>  diffracted well. the detergent anapoe  <dig> proved to be extremely effective with these crystals, improving diffraction to  <dig> -Å resolution . crucially, this crystal form was used to solve our first mk <dig> structure in complex with a prototypical inhibitor chosen from our high-throughput screening lead chemotype. as the project progressed, however, it was supplanted by other crystal forms  that were more amenable to co-crystallization.

pseudoactivated mk <dig> adopts the conformation of inactive mk2
the crystal structure of pseudoactivated mk <dig> in complex with a micromolar lead compound was determined in space group f <dig> . this crystal form was reported subsequent to our work by other investigators  <cit> . superimposition with apo-mk <dig>  illustrates a similar "closed" conformation figure  <dig>  one significant difference is observed in the arrangement of the glycine-rich loop, which assumes a non-canonical orientation by flipping away from the active site to form a short helix. this rearrangement increases the solvent exposure of the atp binding pocket, making this crystal form a good candidate for inhibitor soaking. we successfully soaked an mk2-specific inhibitor into the atp binding pocket, leading to our reference crystal structure . due to the disorder of the activation loop, we were unable to resolve the t222e pseudoactivating mutation. although the mutation was not directly involved in driving a novel crystal form, through altered crystal packing or  a significantly altered activation loop conformation, we believe that the enhanced solubility and stability mk <dig> facilitated crystallization.

structural correlates
for reasons that are still unclear, mk <dig> has an overwhelming propensity to make specific, trimer-forming intermolecular contacts as it crystallizes. some of our mutations abrogated these contacts; instead of shifting crystallization to new conditions and crystal forms, however, those mk <dig> constructs simply did not crystallize. thus, a level of mutagenesis that would be sufficient for most proteins of this size was surprisingly less effective with mk <dig> 

what are these trimers? as noted by hillig et al.  <cit> , two distinct packing interactions are present in both form iv  and form vii  mk <dig> crystals . the type  <dig> trimer is mediated by a draping of the n-terminus, beginning around residue  <dig>  over the n-lobe of another mk <dig> subunit. constructs beginning at residues  <dig> or  <dig> retain this contact and crystallize; those beginning at residue  <dig> lose the contact and do not form crystals. the type  <dig> trimer is mediated by the c-terminal portion of the activation loop packing against helices f, g, and h. constructs in which the activation loop was deleted, being unable to form these contacts, do not crystallize. notably, glu233-arg <dig> and glu238-arg <dig> salt bridges mediate type  <dig> contacts. targeting of these glutamate residues in a second round of entropy-reduction mutagenesis might have altered the type  <dig> contacts enough to spur formation of other crystal forms.

mk <dig> trimer formation is due entirely either to crystallographic symmetry  or to non-crystallographic symmetry . form iv has one molecule/asymmetric unit, and the two types of trimers are formed by adjacent, non-intersecting crystallographic 3-fold symmetry axes. conversely, since space group p <dig> has no 3-fold axes, the  <dig> molecules/asymmetric unit in form vii are arranged such that both trimer types are formed by two non-crystallographic 3-fold axes that nearly intersect in the center of the 12-subunit, virus-like mk <dig> shell.

amazingly, all characterized mk <dig> crystal forms shown in table  <dig> are composed of type  <dig> and/or type  <dig> trimers. forms v and vi  have four molecules/asymmetric unit; three subunits form the type  <dig> non-crystallographic trimer; the fourth, "odd man out" subunit forms, through crystallographic symmetry, the type  <dig> trimer. and, the tenuous packing in form iii  is mediated by trimer formation at two adjacent, non-intersecting crystallographic 3-fold axes, as in the other cubic  crystal form. only the first reported mk <dig> structure  breaks the pattern  <cit> . uniquely compared to all other mk <dig> crystals, the construct used in that study included the complete mk <dig> c-terminus. packing in this crystal form is mediated by the type  <dig> trimer  and a novel  trimeric contact centered at residue  <dig> that positions the extended c-terminus  to pack against another mk <dig> subunit.

although the biological relevance of mk <dig> trimer formation is unknown, we note that trimer formation is structurally incompatible with formation of the mk2-p <dig> complex  <cit> . thus, mk <dig> trimer formation may be a form of self-regulation relevant in vivo.

in summary, much of the mutagenesis work reported here was, in the end, stymied by the unusually strong proclivity of mk <dig> toward trimer formation. nonetheless, our systematic approach did indicate that truncations rather than mutations were more effective for mk <dig> crystallization. the exact position of the mk <dig> n-terminus is more important than is the c-terminus, and the activation loop could not be deleted. surface arginine and glutamate residues drive crystallization more strongly than do surface lysine residues prevent it. the pseudoactivation constructs were helpful, likely due to slight modulation of protein surface properties rather than by producing a different protein conformation. these unusual mk <dig> properties result in many closely related  crystal forms . additional surface mutants  would seem to be required to drive mk <dig> into truly different crystal forms that can be produced under low ionic strength  conditions rather than in high salt.

CONCLUSIONS
the systematic methods for the design, production and evaluation of mk <dig> protein constructs presented here allowed us to reproducibly obtain suitable crystals such that structure-based drug design could proceed. our methods are robust and allowed rapid evaluation of about fifty constructs. this rapidity enabled the scale-up production of selected mk <dig> constructs in multi-milligram quantities proteins for structural studies. using rational site-directed mutagenesis and in-house customized crystallization screens , we were able to identify several novel crystallization conditions. combined with variation of other parameters, such as surface side chain entropy and activation state, these high-throughput techniques produced five new mk <dig> crystal forms, most with improved diffraction characteristics . one such crystal form, grown with a mk <dig> phosphorylation-site pseudoactivation mutant, was used to solve our first mk2/lead inhibitor complex .

several key lessons were learned from this exercise. first, setting reasonable criteria for construct performance and prioritization is essential to identify constructs suitable for further evaluation and possible scale-up. in the case of mk <dig>  most constructs gave satisfactory performance in expression and purification. choices were necessary, however; we prioritized higher-yielding, more soluble constructs  for scale-up and more extensive crystallization screening. implicitly, we assumed that constructs that expressed or purified poorly were less likely to crystallize well. our assumption appears to be supported by the expression yield, protein melting point, and crystallization data of malawski et al.  <cit> . second, a systematic crystallization screen  was required to identify crystallization conditions in a robust manner. indeed, the interplay between multiple constructs and multiple, customized crystallization solutions likely contributed greatly to our success. we note that the composition of customized crystallization screens is protein-specific – for mk <dig>  we used a preponderance of high ionic strength conditions, since repeated screening with, for example, peg solutions never provided crystals. other proteins will behave differently. third, reduction of surface side chain entropy can require several iterative rounds before productive mutation sites are identified. in retrospect, more than one round of surface residue mutations in this study, optimally informed by initial structural information, might have yielded additional crystal forms . fourth, high throughput construct exploration must be initiated early in a drug discovery program in order to synchronize with hit-to-lead synthetic chemistry efforts, preferably in concert with initial target selection studies, i.e. before a high-throughput inhibitor screen is begun. this head start is especially critical for problematic crystallization targets like mk <dig>  applying these lessons learned from our experience with mk <dig> has helped us to accelerate many other structural programs, enabling us to impact lead discovery programs more rapidly and efficiently.
