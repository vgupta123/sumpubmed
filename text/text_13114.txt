BACKGROUND
mirnas are small  non-coding rnas that were originally discovered to regulate development in c. elegans  <cit> . a significant number of mirnas are conserved across different species  <cit> . mirnas regulate gene functions mainly through degradation of their cognate mrnas by perfect matches with the mrna molecules; or via inhibition of protein translation through base pairing of ~ <dig> nucleotides  between mirna and the 3'-untranslated region  of the target mrna molecules  <cit> . expression of mirnas may be regulated by transcription factors , and transcription factors per se may also be regulated by mirnas   <cit> . a single mirna can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but this repression is relatively mild  <cit> . on the other hand one mrna can be targeted by several mirnas, which have additive effects in regulation of protein synthesis  <cit> . for example, smad- <dig> gene has two predicted binding sites for mir-26a  <cit> , and greater suppression effects on protein translation have been observed in mrnas containing multiple binding sites for a mirna  <cit> .

mirnas are involved in the regulation of almost all important biological processes including development  <cit> , differentiation, cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation  <cit>  and energy metabolism  <cit> , including fat metabolism and glucose homeostasis  <cit> . for example, mir- <dig> suppresses glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells  <cit> , thus demonstrating an essential role in plasma glucose homeostasis. knocking down of endogenous mir- <dig>  a mirna abundantly expressed in the liver, reduces plasma cholesterol concentrations in mice  <cit> , with parallel up-regulation of  <dig> mrna transcripts and down-regulation of  <dig> mrna transcripts in the liver  <cit> . mir- <dig> stimulates human adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . analysis of global profiles of mirna expression in skeletal muscle with microarray shows that expression of  <dig> mirnas  are up-regulated  <cit> , whereas expression of  <dig> mirnas  are down-regulated in skeletal muscle of type  <dig> diabetic rats  <cit> .

the prevalence of obesity is increasing markedly in industrialised countries  <cit> , and high fat, high protein, low carbohydrate diets including proprietary diets such as the atkins diet are widely consumed  <cit> . the prevalence of obesity in women of reproductive age continues to rise  <cit> , and it is likely that many women of reproductive age also consume a low carbohydrate, high fat and high protein diet during pregnancy and lactation. however the effects of increased maternal dietary consumption of fat during pregnancy and weaning on the long term health of the offspring are not fully characterized.

many studies have indicated long-term consequences of maternal dietary modifications  during pregnancy and lactation on the development of insulin resistance and risk of cardiovascular disease in the offspring  <cit> . we have previously shown in mice that adult offspring of dams fed a low carbohydrate, high fat and high protein diet during pregnancy and lactation but weaned onto a chow diet have reduced hepatic triglyceride levels in association with increased protein levels of key genes regulating fatty acid oxidation including carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1a  and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha  predominantly in the female offspring  <cit> . pups born to dams on a high fat  diet during gestation and lactation have increased percentage of body fat, plasma glucose, free fatty acids, insulin and cholesterol levels, liver weight and lipid concentrations at weaning or in adulthood  <cit> .

fetal growth is regulated by insulin-like growth factor  <dig>   <cit> . recent data suggest that igf <dig> may regulate fat metabolism. for example, body weight is affected by several polymorphisms in the igf <dig> gene  <cit> , and low circulating igf <dig> concentrations are associated with weight gain and obesity  <cit> . in contrast, high circulating igf <dig> levels associated with the apal polymorphism of igf <dig> are associated with low body weight in middle aged men  <cit> . mice overexpressing igf <dig> have increased fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . maternal dietary protein restriction reduces hepatic expression of igf <dig> in the male fetal offspring. however, whether maternal hf feeding alters offspring igf <dig> expression has not been documented.

following our previous studies on maternal high fat, high protein and low carbohydrate diet <cit> , we used a modified diet to investigate whether maternal hf feeding during pregnancy and lactation altered mrna levels of ppar-α and cpt-1a and whether changes in ppar-α and cpt-1a were related to changes in igf <dig> expression. we also analyzed global mirna expression profile in the liver to determine which mirnas were altered in the offspring born to dams fed a hf diet during pregnancy and lactation.

RESULTS
maternal hf fed offspring had increased mrna levels of ppar-α, cpt-1a and igf <dig> in the liver
we have previously shown that maternal high fat, high protein and low carbohydrate diet fed offspring had increased protein levels of pparα and cpt-1a levels in the liver, in association with reduced hepatic lipid levels, despite having no significant changes in body weight, plasma glucose and lipid profile  <cit> . in this study, a modified hf diet was fed to dams, in which the percentage of fat was increased by more than 2-fold with a small increase in protein levels compared to the chow diet . consistently, no significant difference in body weight, fasting plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and glucose levels were observed between maternal hf fed offspring weaned on a chow diet  and control mice . mrna levels of ppar-α and cpt-1a in the hf/c mice were increased by ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> -fold respectively compared to c/c mice .

levels of mrna expression  were measured with real time qpcr as described in the method section. mean ± s.e. * p <  <dig>  and ** p <  <dig> .

as the maternal hf diet was implemented prior to conception and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation, we investigated whether expression of igf <dig>  an imprinted gene encoding a growth factor expressed during early development  <cit>  was altered in the maternal hf fed offspring. the mrna level of igf <dig> was increased by ~ <dig> -fold in maternal hf diet fed offspring compared to the control animals .

to determine whether increased expression of ppar-α and cpt-1a was related to increased expression of igf <dig> in the maternal hf fed offspring, we measured mrna levels of ppar-α and cpt-1a in igf <dig> ko mice. a hf diet modestly increased hepatic expression of ppar-α and cpt-1a in the wt mice , but the hf diet had no effects on ppar-α and cpt-1a expression in the ko mice , suggesting that expression of igf <dig> was required for the hf diet induced up-regulation of expression of ppar-α and cpt-1a.

both the wild type  and igf <dig> knock out  mice were fed either a hf or chow diet as described in the methods section. mrna levels were measured using real time pcr. mean ± s.e. * p <  <dig>  and ** p <  <dig>  .

hepatic expression of let-7c was reduced in maternal hf offspring
let- <dig> was originally discovered due to its regulation of developmental timing in c. elegans, through binding to the 3'-utr region of lin- <dig>  <cit> . levels of let-7c and other members of let- <dig> including let-7a, let-7b and let-7d were reduced by 2- <dig> -fold in maternal hf fed offspring compared to the control animals .

levels  of let-7s were measured as described in the methods section. mean ± s.e. ** p <  <dig> .

having observed reduced expression of let-7s in maternal hf fed offspring, we measured the global mirna expression profile with microarrays.

expression of ~ <dig> % of mirnas was altered in the maternal hf fed offspring
a cut-off threshold of  <dig> -fold change  <cit>  in mirnas was used to determine whether altered mirnas levels were likely to be significant. of  <dig> mirnas measured, expression of  <dig> mirnas  was increased by ~ <dig> -2-fold , whereas expression of  <dig> mirnas  were reduced by  <dig>  -  <dig>  fold , with mir-483* showing the biggest reduction . in contrast, expression of most mirnas remained unchanged .

levels of mirnas were measured with microarrays as described in the method section. relative values of signals for each mirnas are presented in the two columns.

levels of mirnas were measured with microarrays as described in the method section. relative values of signals for each mirnas were presented in the two columns.

among those mirnas showing reduced expression, average levels of expression were  <dig> arbitrary units , whereas in those showing increased expression, the average levels of the  <dig> mirnas were  <dig> arbitrary units , which was  <dig> -fold lower than those mirnas showing reduced expression.

we validated microarray data with the stem-loop rt-pcr method  <cit>  using purchased mirna primers .  <dig> mirnas  were measured as these mirnas showed different magnitude of reduced expression in the hf offspring . expression of mir-483*, let-7c and mir-29a measured with qpcr were consistent with values obtained from microarray data, with minor differences in the magnitude of changes in expression . however, a discrepancy in levels of mir-30c and mir- <dig> between qpcr and microarray was observed . levels of mir-30c between maternal hf and chow fed offspring were similar when measured with microarrays, but significantly different when measured with qpcr. a ~ <dig> -fold reduction was obtained with microarray analyses whereas a ~42% increase occurred in levels of mir- <dig> in maternal hf offspring measured with qpcr . we also noted that levels of mir-483* were very low when measured with qpcr, consistent with poorly expressed igf <dig> mrna levels. however, data from microarray suggested that mir-483* was abundantly expressed, which was not consistent with qpcr data .

levels of mirnas were measured either with purchased primers for specific mirnas  or poly dt adaptor as described in the method section. mean ± s.e. * p <  <dig>  and *** p <  <dig>  . ** p <  <dig> , and ***p <  <dig>  .

we examined the mir-483* genomic dna location because mir-483* showed the greatest reduction in expression in maternal hf fed offspring, and found that mir-483* was encoded in an intron of igf <dig>  as intronic mirnas may share common promoters as their host genes, many intronic mirnas show significantly correlated expression profiles with their host genes <cit> . thus, we would expect that the levels of intronic mirna  are increased with the host gene  in the hf/c mice. to our surprise, expression of mir-483* in the hf/c was reduced  in association with increased igf <dig> levels. mir- <dig> is also processed from the same mmu-mir- <dig> gene and share most of the complementary sequence of mir-483*  <cit> . we then examined expression levels of mir- <dig> from microarray, and found that expression of mir- <dig> was not markedly different in hf/c mice compared to the controls . we could not validate levels of mir- <dig> with the stem-loop qpcr because the primers for mir- <dig> were not available at the time of the study . therefore, we measured expression of mir- <dig> with another qpcr method involving reverse-transcribed poly adaptor during the rt step  <cit> , and found that the low levels of mir- <dig> expression were consistent with microarray data, similar to poorly expressed mir-483* obtained with the stem-loop method . we repeated measurements of let-7c using the poly  adaptor method and the results were consistent with those obtained from microarray or the stem-loop qpcr . we therefore carried out further validation of mirnas with the poly  adaptor method as this methodology provided flexibility in primer design.

we tried to validate mirnas showing increased expression with the poly  adaptor method. however, among those showing increased expression measured with microarray, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-770-3p and mir-369-3p were very poorly expressed . mir- <dig> was expressed at much higher levels, but a reduced rather than increased expression in maternal hf diet fed offspring was observed . we then focused our study on those mirnas showing reduced expression in maternal hf fed offspring but excluded those poorly expressed mirnas  plus mir- <dig>  as microarray data suggested that mir- <dig> had the greatest level of expression in the liver . data from qpcr confirmed the highly expressed mir- <dig>  but also showed marked reduction in expression in maternal hf fed offspring , which was not consistent with microarray results. however, the levels of most mirna expression measured with qpcr were consistent with data obtained from microarrays except minor differences in the magnitude of changes .

bioinformatic analysis of predicted targets for mirnas
as mir- <dig> was the highest expressed mirna in the liver, it might be an important mirna for the regulation of hepatic gene expression. we analysed the predicted targets with widely used algorithms.  <dig> hits were found using the miranda algorithm  <cit> , whereas  <dig> targets were found using the targetscan algorithm  <cit> . at the time of writing, mir- <dig> was not in the data base of pictar  <cit> . we compared the outcome from miranda and targetsan algorithms using our own purpose-built computer program and found that  <dig> common targets  were predicted by both algorithms.

a feature of mirna function is that several mirnas tend to act together to generate greater effects than single mirna  <cit> . we therefore undertook bioinformatics analysis to investigate whether it was possible to identify common targets for those validated mirnas that showed reduced expression in the maternal hf fed offspring using our own purpose-built computer program. we found that zswim <dig> , a protein whose function was yet to be characterised  <cit> , was targeted by  <dig> mirnas namely mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-483*.  <dig> genes were targeted by  <dig> different mirnas ' ' and  <dig> genes  were targeted by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> ' '. these results suggested that functions of specific genes might be co-ordinately regulated by a small number of mirnas.

discussion
maternal hf fed offspring mice have: 1) increased hepatic expression of key genes including those regulating fetal growth  and fat metabolism ; 2) altered expression of a small percentage  of important mirnas. among the mirnas showing reduced expression, let-7c regulates developmental timing  <cit>  and mir- <dig> regulates fat oxidation  <cit> . thus, these data suggest co-ordinated changes in key metabolic genes and mirnas that regulate early fetal growth and fat metabolism in offspring of dams fed hf diet.

as both offspring from hf- and chow-fed dams are weaned onto the same chow diet and maintained on chow until adulthood, changes in expression of key metabolic genes and mirnas in adult offspring are likely to occur prior to weaning. igf <dig> is a growth factor highly expressed during early development  <cit> . offspring igf <dig> gene expression can be altered by maternal dietary modifications during early development. for example, a maternal low protein diet restricted only to the preimplantation period reduces hepatic igf <dig> mrna in fetal rats  <cit>  and maternal dietary calorie restriction increases igf <dig> mrna levels in the liver and skeletal muscle in fetal sheep  <cit> . here we further show that hepatic mrna levels of igf <dig> are elevated in the adult mouse offspring born to dams fed a hf diet, suggesting that maternal hf feeding increases offspring hepatic igf <dig> expression prior to weaning. this is supported by our observation that hepatic igf <dig> levels in fetal offspring from dams fed a hf diet are increased . similarly, it is likely that altered expression of hepatic ppar-α and cpt-1a and mirnas in maternal hf fed adult offspring might have also occurred prior to weaning.

growth
igf <dig> is an early growth factor expressed at the two-cell stage in the mouse embryo <cit> , and mice deficient in igf <dig> have reduced birth weight  <cit> . in contrast, excess igf <dig> in transgenic mice promotes fetal overgrowth resulting in increased birth weight  <cit> . our data showing that hf/c offspring have increased igf <dig> expression and a trend toward increased liver weight , suggest that liver growth prior to weaning may be increased in maternal hf fed offspring . this finding is consistent with an early observation in rats showing that maternal hf feeding during gestation increases offspring liver weight, in association with increased body weight and percentage body fat at weaning <cit> . in our study, the body weight of maternal hf fed offspring at weaning is ~ <dig> %  greater than control mice , consistent with increased hepatic igf <dig> expression. however, we observed no significant difference in body weights between maternal hf and chow fed adult offspring, when both sets of offspring were fed the same chow diet from weaning, which could be due to that circulating igf <dig> is markedly decreased after birth in rodents  <cit> , suggesting that igf <dig> is unlikely to play a major role in post weaning growth.

pparα promotes hepatic proliferation through inhibition of let-7c  <cit> . let-7c plays a critical role in the regulation of growth <cit> . overexpression of let-7c decreases c-myc and mir- <dig>  suppressing the growth of hepatocytes  <cit> . consistently, we have observed that mrna levels of ppar-α  are elevated whereas levels of let-7c reduced in maternal hf fed offspring , suggesting a co-ordinated regulation of mrna and mirna expression in favour of promoting hepatic growth.

it is uncertain whether let-7c is regulated by igf <dig>  our data showing increased igf <dig> expression in association with reduced let-7c expression, is consistent with the negative regulation of let-7c by ppar-α as discussed above. in igf <dig> ko mice, expression of let-7c levels are increased by ~31% . these data suggest a negative correlation between igf <dig> and let-7c expression . further studies are required to determine whether let-7c expression is directly regulated by igf <dig>  taking together, our data suggest that maternal hf feeding has induced co-ordinated changes in expression of early growth factor , transcription factor  and mirna  to promote hepatic growth.

fat metabolism
ppar-α is a master transcription factor regulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . we have shown previously that maternal high fat high protein and low carbohydrate diet-fed offspring have increased protein levels of ppar-α and cpt-1a in association with reduced hepatic lipid levels  <cit> . here we further show that mrna levels of ppar-α and cpt-1a are increased in the maternal hf fed offspring, suggesting that maternal hf feeding increases expression of ppar-α and cpt-1a mrna and protein levels.

igf <dig> may also regulate fat metabolism as low circulating igf <dig> concentrations are associated with weight gain and obesity  <cit> , whereas high circulating igf <dig> levels are associated with low body weight in middle aged men  <cit> . mice overexpressing igf <dig> have increased fatty acid oxidation  <cit> . our data show that maternal hf offspring have increased igf <dig> expression with parallel increased ppar-α, whereas a hf induced increase in ppar-α expression is suppressed in the igf <dig> ko mice. these data suggest that igf <dig> might regulate fat metabolism through regulation of ppar-α expression, and that up-regulation of ppar-α in maternal hf diet fed offspring is mediated, at least in part through increased expression of igf <dig> 

mir- <dig> is abundantly expressed in the liver and regulates fat metabolism  <cit> , as knocking down mir- <dig> increases hepatic fatty-acid oxidation  <cit> . hepatic expression of mir- <dig> is reduced in the maternal hf adult offspring , which is consistent with increased expression of pparα and cpt-1a, two key molecules regulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation . maternal hf fed adult offspring have reduced hepatic lipid levels when weaned onto a chow diet and maintained on the chow diet until adulthood <cit> . it is likely that increased capacity of fat oxidation  prior to weaning are maintained until adulthood. this continuing increased fatty acid oxidation capacity leads to reduced hepatic lipid levels when hf offspring mice are weaned onto a chow diet. taking together, our data suggest that maternal hf feeding increases expression of key genes regulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation and mirna in the offspring.

the mechanisms by which early changes are maintained until adulthood require further studies. however, it is likely that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role. igf <dig> expression is regulated by dna methylation <cit> , and increased igf <dig> expression is associated with changes in dna methylation  <cit> . gestational choline deficiency causes global and igf <dig> gene dna hypermethylation through up-regulation of dnmt <dig> expression in fetal offspring  <cit> . thus, it is likely that increased igf <dig> expression in maternal hf adult offspring is associated with altered dna methylation in the offspring. similar mechanisms may exist in ppar-α, because hepatic expression of ppar-α is regulated by dna methylation  <cit> . a maternal low protein diet during pregnancy and lactation reduces dna methylation in the promoter region of ppar-α  <cit> , in association with increased ppar-α mrna levels  <cit> . expression of mirnas can also be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. let-7a- <dig> belongs to the let- <dig> mirna gene family and is heavily methylated by the dna methyltransferases dnmt <dig> and dnmt3b  <cit> . let-7a- <dig> hypomethylation facilitates epigenetic reactivation of the gene and elevates expression of let-7a- <dig> in human lung cancer cells  <cit> . thus, altered dna methylation could be involved in early changes maintained until adulthood.

interestingly, several important proteins involved in epigenetics are predicted targets for those mirnas showing altered expression in the hf offspring. for example, mir- <dig> is the most abundantly expressed mirna in the liver detected with microarray . according to the targetscan algorithm  <cit> , mir- <dig> targets include methyl-cpg binding domain protein  <dig> and methyl cpg binding protein <dig> . among predicted targets of let-7c are proteins including hypermethylated in cancer  <dig> , chromodomain helicase  <dig>  dot1-like histone h <dig> methyltransferase .

a feature of mirna function is that several mirnas tend to act together, and a relatively small set of mirnas account for most of the differences in mirna profiles between cell lineages and tissues  <cit> . for example, it has been shown that expression of  <dig> mirnas  is up-regulated  <cit> , whereas expression of  <dig> mirnas  is down-regulated in skeletal muscle of type  <dig> diabetic rats  <cit> . here we show that levels of only ~ <dig> % of mirnas are altered in the maternal hf fed mouse offspring, whereas levels of the remaining mirnas are unchanged. these data suggest that 1) these  <dig> mirnas are likely to be expressed during early development and play active roles in the regulation of metabolism and fetal growth; and 2) if these mirnas have common targeted transcripts, they are likely to have greater effects than a single mirna in suppressing protein synthesis  <cit> .

however, it remains a challenge to identify common targets shared by several mirnas, because several hundreds or even over  <dig> predicted targets may arise from one single mirna using current algorithms. experimentally, it is impractical to knock down each of the mirnas. in this study, we have written a computer program that allows us to analyse quickly common targets shared by several mirnas. for example, we have undertaken analysis of common targets among  <dig> mirnas and found that the maximum number of shared targets is  <dig> mirnas and no common targets are found among  <dig> different mirnas. mecp <dig> is a common predicted target for  <dig> mirnas including two abundantly expressed mirnas . mecp <dig> is required to maintain cpg status of genomic dna <cit> . maternal nutrient restriction decreases mecp <dig> levels in the brain in offspring rats <cit> . among those mirnas showing increased expression in the hf fed offspring, histone  <dig> h <dig> is a common target for  <dig> different mirnas .

finally, despite the observation that offspring born to dams fed a hf diet during pregnancy and lactation and fed a chow diet from weaning have no significant changes in phenotype compared to the control animals, marked changes in expression of important genes such as igf <dig>  ppar-α and cpt-1a and a class of mirnas have occurred. such altered expression of metabolic genes and mirnas are likely to affect the homeostatic responses of such offspring to dietary challenges in later life.

CONCLUSIONS
a maternal hf diet prior to conception, during pregnancy and lactation induces coordinated and long-lasting changes in expression of igf <dig> and key fat metabolic genes and mirnas in the offspring, which may have long-term effects on their health.
