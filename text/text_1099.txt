BACKGROUND
candida albicans colonize distinct microanatomical regions such as the oro-gastointestinal tract as a commensal, but also accounts for more than 50% of all fungal systemic infections  <cit> . candida esophagitis represents a severe threat to an immunocompromised body and, especially in neutropenic patients, often is the first manifestation before candida sepsis develops  <cit> . host defense mechanisms preventing mucosal  candidiasis are poorly understood, but include both innate and adaptive responses  <cit> .

the gastrointestinal epithelial layer represents a barrier that is usually adequate to restrain commensal microbes, but is often insufficient to protect against microbial pathogens. once this physical barrier is penetrated, recognition of invading microbiota is the first step in the initiation of a fast immune response and involves the activation of pattern recognition receptors by microbial pathogens and their products  <cit> . c. albicans have been shown to activate a subset of pattern recognition receptors, the toll-like receptors . this family of transmembrane receptors recognizes a broad variety of signature motifs on microbes and transduces signals leading to the activation of transcription factors  <cit> , production of cytokines and antimicrobial peptides  <cit> . however there is some controversy and inconclusive data which tlr subtypes are activated by c. albicans. some reports indicated a critical role for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in activating the host defense response alone or in combination with the ss-glucan receptor dectin- <dig>  <cit>  whereas other studies showed that tlr- <dig> and tlr- <dig> are responsible for the recognition of c. albicans  <cit> .

in addition the downstream effectors in the immune response against c. albicans are largely unknown. there is growing evidence that human β-defensins  are critical components of both the innate and adaptive immune responses to candida infections with distinct antifungal efficacies and mechanisms for hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig>  <cit> . expression of hbds is regulated by a plethora of proinflammatory cytokines like il-1β, tnf-α and egf-receptor ligands activating downstream effectors like the transcription factors nf-κb or ap- <dig>  <cit> . hbds are secreted by epithelial cells and protect the gastrointestinal mucosa by antimicriobial activity as well as by chemotactic properties recruiting polymorphonuclear leukocytes  to the site of infection  <cit> . transepithelial migration of pmns is observed during oral candida infection and is believed to play a crucial role in the clearance of infection and in epithelial homeostasis  <cit> . this protective phenotype is associated with production of epithelial proinflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  il-1β and tnf-α. however, the mechanisms by which pmns and epithelial cells interact to protect mucosal surfaces from c. albicans invasion are mostly unknown.

we have recently shown that hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> are highly expressed in candida esophagitis and that the α-defensins human neutrophil peptides 1– <dig> were also upregulated  <cit>  indicating involvement of neutrophils in the immune response to the c. albicans infection  <cit> . this is in line with the observation that il- <dig> is strongly expressed in the mucosa of patients suffering by candida infection  <cit> , since this cytokine is involved in recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  to sites of microbial infection  <cit> .

in the present study we explored the mechanisms involved in the induction of hbd expression in an in vitro model of candida esophagitis. using this co-culture model we analyzed the contribution of pmns in the regulation of epithelial hbd expression. we found that hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> are strongly upregulated through high concentrations of c. albicans alone. if lower concentrations of c. albicans were used, only a moderate induction of these hbds were observed that was strongly enhanced by coculture of the epithelial cell line with pmns, emphasizing the important role of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in early host defense against fungal infection. furthermore we were able to show that the nf-κb and mapk signalling pathways contribute to the regulation of hbd- <dig> and that hbd- <dig> is a downstream target of a distinct egfr/mapk/ap- <dig> pathway in candida esophagitis.

RESULTS
supernatants of c. albicans induce hbd expression in oe <dig> cells
to establish an in vitro model for candida esophagitis we first treated several oesophageal cell lines  with established inducers of hbd-expression. only for the oe <dig> cell line a reliable induction of the mrna of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> could be detected . we next challengend oe <dig> cells with supernatants of c. albicans cell culture growing under various concentrations of c. albicans. supernatants of c. albicans induce upregulation of hbds in a concentration-dependent manner. for the supernatants of the density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> c. albicans cells/ml no significant induction of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> was detected . in contrast the supernatants of  <dig> ×  <dig> c. albicans cells/ml resulted in a significant upregulation of hbd- <dig> and to a smaller extent of hbd- <dig> . hbd <dig> expression was not altered by one of the inducers or the supernatants .

pmns significantly enhances hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression during c. albicans infection
to elucidate a potential functional interaction of pmns and epithelial cells in the immune response to c. albicans infection we established a transwell coculture model. in this two-compartment model we tested the effect of a coculture of oe <dig> cells, pmns from healthy donors and c. albicans in different settings: 1) direct contact of oe <dig> cells with pmns and 2) direct contact of oe <dig> cells with c. albicans. the corresponding third component of the system  was cocultured in the transwell system allowing for the interaction of auto- and paracrine factors . since higher cell numbers than  <dig>  ×  <dig> c. albicans cells/ml or  <dig>  ×  <dig> pmn/ml repressed growth of oe <dig> cells in the direct setting , all experiments were conducted with these concentrations of c. albicans and/or pmns. the direct or indirect coculture of oe <dig> with c. albicans had only small effects on the expression of hbd- <dig>  and hbd- <dig>  comparable with effects observed with supernatants of the low concentration of c. albicans . the direct interaction of oe <dig> cells with pmns led to an increase of the expression of both hbds . the interaction of oe <dig> cells with pmns lead to a significant upregulation of c. albicans induced hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression compared to the induction with c. albicans or pmn alone . substitution of the live c. albicans by supernatants of the density of  <dig>  ×  <dig> c. albicans cells/ml also lead to the synergistic effects. to keep the manuscript mor concise we only show the data for the live c. albicans.

c. albicans activate nf-κb in oe <dig> cells
to further analyse the mechanisms involved in the regulation of hbd expression during candida esophagitis we determined whether the observed induction of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression by c. albicans was associated with the activation of nf-κb. this transcription factor has been shown to be a central regulator of hbd- <dig> expression  <cit>  but there is some controversy if nf-κb is also involved in the regulation of hbd- <dig> expression  <cit> . by emsa we could show that nf-κb is activated  in association with c. albicans mediated induction of β-defensin expression. in parallel to the observed dependency of defensin expression on the cell number of c. albicans a concentration dependent activation of nf-κb was observed . the coculture of oe <dig> cells with pmns or c. albicans also led to an increased dna-binding of nf-κb that was further enhanced in the transwell setting . supershift assays revealed that the nf-κb complex consisted of the p <dig> and p <dig> subunits .

nf-κb is involved in the induction of hbd- <dig> but not hbd- <dig> expression
to evaluate the putative contribution of nf-κb in c. albicans induced hbd expression we transiently transfected cells with sirna directed against rela/p <dig> as the transcriptional active subunit of the p65/p <dig> nf-κb complex  <cit> . transfection of oe <dig> cells led to a significant reduction of the expression of rela/p <dig> . furthermore the induction of nf-κb by c. albicans was inhibited by this strategy as shown by emsa . this reduction of nf-κb activation strongly reduced the c. albicans mediated induction of hbd- <dig> expression but had no effect on the hbd- <dig> expression . in the coculture settings the reduction of rela/p <dig> expression also attenuated hbd- <dig> induction . these results support a critical role of nf-κb in regulating hbd- <dig> but not hbd- <dig> expression.

role of ap- <dig> and the mapk pathway in c. albicans mediated β-defensin induction
our results indicated a critical role for nf-κb in c. albicans mediated induction of hbd- <dig> but not for the regulation of hbd- <dig> expression. since the hbd- <dig> promotor contains a functional binding site for the ap- <dig> transcription factor  <cit>  we conducted emsa with a probe containing an ap- <dig> consensus sequence. c. albicans alone  or in the coculture setting  activated ap- <dig> in oe <dig> cells and supershift experiments identified c-jun as one of the central subunits involved . activation of the c-jun/ap- <dig> complex by the mapk pathway is well established  <cit>  and a recent report indicated a role of this pathway in the response of macrophages to the infection with c. albicans  <cit> . to analyse the contribution of the mapk/ap- <dig> pathway in the induction of β-defensin induction by c. albicans pharmacological inhibitors selective for individual pathway were utilized.

as shown in figure 7a and 7b inhibition of each of the major mapk pathways resulted in a reduction of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> induction by c. albicans.

activation of the egfr is an upstream event in regulation of hbd- <dig> expression
upstream of the mapk pathway several growth factor receptors have been shown to be involved in the immune response to microbiota  <cit> . to investigate the upstream events leading to the activation of the mapk pathway in infection with c. albicans we used blocking antibodies against several growth factor receptors. the results revealed a clear involvement of the egf-receptor in the regulation of hbd- <dig> expression by c. albicans. whereas induction of hbd- <dig> expression was slightly inhibited by a neutralizing antibody targeting egfr transactivation, a significant reduction of c. albicans-induced hbd- <dig> expression observed .

tgf-α is involved in egfr mediated hbd- <dig> induction
finally we searched for the ligand activating the egfr. by using blocking antibodies for the established egfr-ligands egf, hb-egf, amphiregulin and tgf-α we were able to show that tgf-α is involved in the egfr mediated upregulation of hbd- <dig> expression .

discussion
candida esophagitis represents a severe threat to an immunocompromised body and the course of the infection is determined by both pathogen- and host-dependent factors  <cit> . it is well established that epithelial cells of the esophagus are the central target of an oro-esophageal invasive candida infection but there are only very limited data on the host response preventing a candida esophagitis. in the present study we identified the nf-κb and mapk/ap- <dig> pathways as central regulators of epithelial hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression during c. albicans infection. furthermore we were able to show a crucial role of the interaction of pmns with the epithelial cell compartment for the induction of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression during candida infection of esophageal epithelial cells. finally hbd- <dig> expression is dependent on transactivation of egfr by tgf-α. this is the first report delineating molecular mechanisms leading to upregulation of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> in esophageal candida infection suggesting differential regulation of these two central epithelial antibiotic peptides in response to a c. albicans infection. we were able to show a concentration dependency of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> induction upon stimulation with c. albicans supernatants . this dose dependent effect could be at least in part be mediated through stronger induction of nf-κb  and ap- <dig>  through higher concentrations of c. albicans. a comparable concentration-dependent effect of supernatants of environmental airborne fungi on cytokine release of eosinophils  <cit>  and of c. albicans on the activation of nf-κb  <cit>  was recently reported.

there is some controversy about the relevance of the nf-κb and ap- <dig> binding sites in the promotor of hbd- <dig> for full induction of hbd- <dig> expression after treatment with il-1β or infection with microbiota. wehkamp and collegues showed that the parallel activation of nf-κb and ap- <dig> is needed for full transcriptional activation of the hbd-2-promotor after il-1β stimulation, treatment of keratinocytes with supernatants of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> , or e. coli mediated hbd- <dig> induction  <cit> . on the other hand another study demonstrated induction of hbd- <dig> expression through fusobacterium nucleatum in human gingival epithelial cells independent of nf-κb activation  <cit>  and there is also evidence for induction of hbd- <dig> through salmonella enteritidis  <cit>  or h. pylori  <cit>  in the absence of functional ap- <dig>  in the present work we were able to show that both nf-κb and ap- <dig> activation are required for full upregulation of the hbd- <dig> mrna after treatment with either supernatants of c. albicans or the coculture of c. albicans with pmns. inhibiton of the nf-κb or of the mapk/ap- <dig> pathway significantly reduced the induction of hbd- <dig> expression confirming the central role of both transcription factors. these observations are in line with recent results for h. pylori infection  <cit>  and the effects of lactobacilli and the vsl# <dig> bacterial mixture on enterocytes  <cit> . the role of nf-κb is less clear in the regulation of hbd- <dig> expression. in contrast to a recently reported role of nf-κb in the regulation of the hbd- <dig> gene in keratinocytes  <cit>  the majority of data failed to show a functional relevance for nf-κb in controlling hbd- <dig> expression  <cit> . by using sirna targeting the rela/p <dig> subunit of nf-κb we could demonstrate that c. albicans mediates hbd- <dig> upregulation through a mapk/ap- <dig> pathway independently of the observed nf-κb acitvation. to investigate the proposed role of pmns in the immune response the c. albicans infection  <cit>  we established an in vitro model . pmns alone induced nf-κb and ap- <dig> leading to hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression. coincubation of pmns with c. albicans lead to a significant upregulation of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression compared to effects of pmns or c. albicans alone. inhibition of the mapk/ap- <dig> pathway reduced the expression of both hbds under this condition. the fact that pmns alone induced hbd expression indicated that pmns could contribute to the induction of antimicrobial peptides in epithelia during inflammation. there is some evidence that a tlr- <dig> mediated interplay between pmns and epithelial cells is important for the protective response against candida infections  <cit>  but the exact mechanisms remained elusive. one the one hand pmns induced expression and release of il- <dig> and il- <dig> in o <dig> cells  which might in turn activate nf-κb and ap- <dig> leading to hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression. on the other hand the induction of a th <dig> response, i.e. tnf-α and interferon-γ might directly induce or enhance the expression of hbds as reported recently  <cit> . on the other hand pmns are able to establish an anti-fungal response by upregulate the expression of tlr <dig> in epithelial cells  <cit> . the observed more pronounced effect on hbd- <dig> expression are in line with the theory that hbd- <dig> might be clinically more relevant than hbd- <dig> since hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> have potent fungicidal activity against c. albicans at micromolar concentrations, with hbd- <dig> being about  <dig> times more fungicidal than hbd- <dig>  <cit> . finally we demonstrated that hbd- <dig> expression was induced by transactivation of the egfr independent of egf . many signals besides egf converge and result in egfr-dependent signaling which is important for various biological processes including normal growth, development and as shown recently for inflammation or innate immune response  <cit> . using blocking antibodies for the egfr-ligands egf, hb-egf, amphiregulin and tgf-α we were able to show that most likely tgf-α is involved in the egfr mediated upregulation of hbd- <dig> expression . since we are also able to inhibit the induction of hbd <dig> by the supernatants of  <dig> ×  <dig> c. albicans cells/ml by egfr and/or tgf-α blocking antibodies we speculate that the egfr-ligand is secreted by oe <dig> cells. ligands of the egfr are expressed as transmembrane precursors. these are released from the cell surface following shedding of the extracellular domain by a family of metalloproteinases ). adam <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> are the sheddases of the egfr ligands in response to various stimuli. since human cathelicidin cationic antimicrobial protein - <dig> and its active peptide ll- <dig> have been shown to be involved in the transactivation of the egfr at the airway epithelial surfaces  <cit>  it is tempting to speculate that the activation of pmns by c. albicans leads to secretion of proinflammatory mediators including leukotriene b <dig>  and ll- <dig>  <cit>  which in turn amplifies the inflammatory response  <cit>  and leads to the shedding of egfr-ligands.

in conclusion we were able to establish a complex in vitro model for candida infection of esophageal cells to investigate the signalling events leading to upregulation of hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression.

CONCLUSIONS
this analysis of signal transduction events in esophageal candida infection demonstrated a potential functional interaction of epithelial cells with pmns and that egfr, nf-κb and mapk/ap- <dig> are involved in divergent signalling events governing hbd- <dig> and hbd- <dig> expression. especially the observed effect of pmns on hbd expression might explain the high incidence of candida esophagitis and candida related deaths in neutropenic patients.
