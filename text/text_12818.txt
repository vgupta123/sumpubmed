BACKGROUND
p-glycoprotein , a membrane protein that acts as an atp-binding cassette  transporter, is actively involved in the efflux of antineoplastic agents from cancer cells  <cit> . together with the other members of the abc transporters family, it provides protection against xenobiotics and certain endogenous molecules, producing the multidrug resistance  phenotype, by which cancer cells become insensitive or unresponsive to a wide spectrum of drugs  <cit> . this transporter is encoded by the mdr1/abcb <dig> gene , mapped at 7q <dig>  which is usually expressed in a limited number of tissues   <cit> . the mdr <dig> gene is composed by two promoters, a major downstream/proximal  and a minor upstream , along with  <dig> exons  <cit> . in human cells, the dsp, which encompasses one cpg island, along with two other cpg islands  regulates most of the transcriptional activity  <cit> . like other promoters, sequences downstream of the initiation site are also important for the overall transcription regulation  <cit>  and it has been shown that mdr <dig> transcription might be modulated by proteins capable of modifying nucleosomal histones  <cit> . thus, epigenetic mechanisms are likely to play an important role in mdr <dig> expression regulation.

remarkably, mdr <dig> promoter methylation is very frequent in prostate carcinoma   <cit> , which represents the second most frequent neoplasia among male population worldwide  and the fifth most common cancer overall  <cit> , being the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men  <cit> . this observation, in conjunction with the significantly lower levels of methylation observed in non-tumorous prostate tissues, has placed mdr <dig> in the restricted group of candidate epigenetic-based biomarkers specific for pca  <cit> . because p-gp expression has been found to be generally lower in pca than normal prostate glands  <cit> , cancer-associated aberrant promoter methylation has been postulated as the main mechanism underlying mdr <dig> silencing in pca  <cit> . however, functional evidence for that association has not been reported yet.

it is widely acknowledged that dna methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications, act in concert to regulate gene expression through alterations in chromatin structure  <cit> . aberrant methylation of promoter cpg islands results in transcriptional silencing through several mechanisms, including the attraction of proteins that interact with histone deacetylases, and chromatin condensation, precluding the binding of transcriptional factors to the promoter, thus modulating gene expression and, consequently, tumour phenotype. as a result, the bulk of methylation in a tumour may reflect its biological and clinical behavior  <cit> . likewise, histone post-translational modifications are also strongly correlated with transcription regulation. both positive  and negative-acting marks  are established across promoters during gene activation or gene repression, respectively, and the interplay of those histone modifications ultimately control gene expression  <cit> . importantly, the interplay between dna methylation and histone modifications during gene silencing is currently acknowledged, as well as their importance in the integration of environmental and intrinsic stimuli in gene expression control.

thus, we aimed to elucidate the role of epigenetic mechanisms in mdr <dig> deregulation in prostate carcinogenesis. for that purpose, mdr <dig> promoter methylation and p-gp expression was firstly assessed in a series of pca, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia  – a precursor lesion of pca – and non-tumorous prostate tissues . then, pca cell lines were exposed to epigenetic modulating drugs and their effect on mdr <dig> promoter methylation and mrna and protein expression was assessed. finally, activating histone post-translational modifications associated with the mdr <dig> promoter region, prior and after exposure to epigenetic modulating drugs, were surveyed and correlated with gene expression status.

p-gp immunoexpression in prostatic tissues
as expected, immunoreactivity for p-gp was found in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. statistically significant differences in p-gp expression among the four groups of samples were detected . most pca  and hgpin  samples showed decreased p-gp expression , while all bph and npt exhibited normal expression . thus, a decrease in immunoexpression of p-gp was apparent from non-tumorous prostate tissues, to hgpin, to tumors  . pairwise comparisons disclosed significant differences in all cases  except for npt vs. hbp. a representative example of p-gp immunoexpression results is provided in figure 2b.

p-gp immunoexpression and mdr <dig> promoter methylation in prostate tissues
the distribution of mdr <dig> methylation levels in prostate tissues according to p-gp immunoexpression is graphically displayed in figure  <dig>  statistical analysis demonstrated significant differences in methylation levels among immunoexpression groups  <dig> and 2+, and 1+ and 2+ , when all types of prostate tissue samples were considered. however, no statistically significant differences in mdr <dig> methylation levels were apparent between tumors scored  <dig> and 1+ for p-gp immunoexpression. thus, the differences depicted between immunoexpression groups  <dig> and 1+, in the one hand, and group 2+, in the other, are mainly due to the inclusion of non-cancerous tissues, i.e., bph and npt in group 2+.

methylation and expression analysis of mdr <dig> in pca cell lines
to further assess whether mdr <dig> was epigenetically deregulated in pca, the four cell lines were exposed to epigenetic modulating drugs and the results were analyzed either by bisulfite sequencing, qmsp or qrt-pcr.

bisulfite sequencing was performed in three pca cell lines – lncap, du <dig> and pc <dig> - to specifically assess the methylation status of eleven cpg dinucleotides localized in the analyzed promoter region, before and after exposure to dac and/or tsa . according to the results, lncap was the one with the lower number of methylated sites, whereas pc <dig> displayed the higher number of methylated cpg dinucleotides. after treatment with epigenetic modulating drugs, no significant changes were observed, except for pc <dig>  which upon exposure to dac, either alone or combined with tsa, displayed partial loss of methylation at some cpg.

additionally, methylation levels of all prostate cancer cell lines  were also tested by qmsp in a smaller region comprised within the sequence analyzed by bisulfite sequencing . all pca cells displayed methylation at the dsp promoter region of mdr <dig>  although levels were variable. the highest methylation levels were observed for pc <dig>  which concurrently displayed the lowest mrna relative expression levels, corroborating bisulfite sequencing results. in addition, as previously observed, lncap cells were those depicting the lowest methylation levels. furthermore, and except for pc <dig> in which a slightly significant decrease in methylation levels was detected after treatment with dac alone or combined with tsa , no significant effects were found in methylation levels compared to mock cells in pca cell lines, in line with bisulfite sequencing analysis results.

nevertheless, mdr <dig> expression levels increased in all cancer cell lines after treatment with epigenetic modulating drugs . interestingly, re-expression levels were significantly higher when dac and tsa were used in combination, in all cell lines  except for lncap, in which tsa alone induced the most impressive enhancement in mdr <dig> transcript levels .

effect of epigenetic modulating drugs on activating histone marks at the mdr <dig> promoter in pca cell lines
because histone post-translational modifications are also associated with gene transcription activation/repression status, chip analysis was carried out for the native mdr <dig> promoter in lncap, du <dig> and pc <dig> cell lines, after treatment with tsa alone or combined with dac. moreover, since the effect in mdr <dig> re-expression of dac alone was modest, the histone marks were not assessed for this treatment regimen.

interestingly, for all cell lines, enrichment in histone activating marks  at the mdr <dig> gene promoter was found, after exposure to tsa alone or in combination with dac, compared to untreated cells . the active marks’ fold variation differed among the treatments and respective cell lines, in accordance with the above mentioned re-expression data, excluding pc <dig>  whereas in lncap cells tsa exposure induced an impressive increase in the accumulation of all the studied activation marks within mdr <dig> promoter, in du <dig> the most evident effect was observed after combined treatment. however, no obvious increase in fold of the assessed activating marks was observed in pc <dig> cells for both treatments. among those marks, h3k4me <dig> was the one which showed the highest variation in all cell lines. collectively, these findings indicate that mdr <dig> expression is mostly regulated through histone post-translational covalent modifications. indeed, western blot results showed that p-glycoprotein levels increased after exposure to tsa alone  or in combination with dac  .

discussion
the p-glycoprotein, encoded by the mdr1/abcb <dig> gene, is a transmembrane protein involved in atp-dependent transport of specific substrates across lipid membranes, playing an important role in steroid metabolism and in the export of metabolites, carcinogens and cytotoxic drugs such as anthracyclines, taxanes, vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins  <cit> . although several mutations in this transporter have been associated with human disease, the actual consequences in its function are still controversial  <cit> . in pca, mdr <dig> is frequently methylated at its promoter region  compared to non-tumorous prostate tissues and has thus been proposed as a pca biomarker  <cit> . although a few studies have correlated mdr <dig> promoter methylation with decreased transcription in pca  <cit> , the biologic impact of this epigenetic alteration and its role in prostate carcinogenesis has not been fully elucidated. herein, we showed that although mdr <dig> promoter methylation is, indeed, a frequent event in pca, occurring early in prostate carcinogenesis and it is associated with decreased mrna and protein levels. however, promoter methylation does not seem to be prime cause of mdr <dig> silencing. instead, our results indicate that post-translational histone modifications constitute the mechanism underlying mdr <dig> deregulation in pca.

promoter methylation of several cancer-related genes  has been extensively documented in pca and seems to occur early in prostate carcinogenesis, as demonstrated by its intermediate frequency in hgpin lesions  <cit> . high frequency of mdr <dig> promoter methylation has been previously reported in pca, ranging between 54% and 88%  <cit> . in our study, mdr <dig> methylation was found in  <dig> % of the tumors, which is within the range of previous reports, as well as in  <dig> % of hgpin lesions. to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate mdr <dig> methylation in hgpin lesions, which are precursors of prostate adenocarcinoma. moreover, non-cancerous prostate tissues, including npt and hbp, were scarcely methylated, in line with previous reports  <cit> . taken together, these results sustain that the progressive methylation of genes that play critical roles in controlling cell proliferation or differentiation, as well as protection of dna from mutagens, constitutes an important mechanism not only in neoplastic transformation, but also in the process of tumor progression in the prostate. this postulate is further supported by the association between methylation levels of several of the aforementioned genes with tumor aggressiveness  <cit> . additionally, we found that mdr <dig> promoter methylation levels increased with pathological stage, in accordance with previous studies, which also disclosed an association with higher gleason score  <cit> , not found in our series. thus, mdr <dig> seems to follow the same trend of other cancer-related genes in prostate carcinogenesis.

the association of aberrant promoter methylation with gene silencing has been demonstrated for several genes in many cancer models  <cit> . in this study, we found that the expression of p-gp, the protein encoded by mdr <dig>  was inversely correlated with promoter methylation levels. similar results were previously reported for pca at protein  <cit>  and transcript level  <cit> . thus, it seems reasonable to assume that aberrant cpg island methylation was responsible for mdr <dig> silencing in pca. to test that hypothesis, we exposed four pca cell lines to epigenetic modulating drugs, which are able to reverse dna methylation and histone deacetylation. surprisingly, increased expression of mdr <dig> mrna was not associated with a decrease in methylation levels, but also the highest re-expression levels were observed when the demethylating agent was associated with the hdac inhibitor. these results strongly suggested that histone modifications are more likely to be the main cause of mdr <dig> silencing in pca. it could be argued that the concentration of dac to which pca cell lines were exposed was not sufficient to induce mdr <dig> demethylation. however, not only the same concentration is effective for inducing demethylation of other genes in pca cell lines  <cit>  but also the use of tsa alone was able to increase mdr <dig> expression in our experiments. nevertheless, mdr <dig> expression was more robustly up-regulated following exposure to both epigenetic modulating drugs. it might be questioned whether the analyzed region of the mdr <dig> gene is critical for regulation of expression. nonetheless, it has been previously demonstrated that the cpg island analyzed in our study was involved in the regulation of mdr <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit>  and that it was densely methylated in pca  <cit> . alternatively, the possibility that exposure to dac and tsa leads to re-activation of genes which positively regulate mdr <dig> can not be dismissed.

to further investigate whether histone modification might be involved in mdr <dig> silencing in pca, we compared histone active marks  at the mdr <dig> gene promoter, after exposure to tsa alone or in combination with dac, compared to untreated cells. we found an overall enhancement in these active marks following exposure to tsa and/or dac, in particular the h3k4me <dig> mark. importantly, these findings were correlated, at protein level, with an increase in p-gp expression. interestingly, enhancement of h3ac at the mdr <dig> promoter has been previously correlated with gene activation in sarcoma cell lines  <cit> . thus, our results indicate that histone onco-modifications are likely to be the most important epigenetic event associated with mdr <dig> downregulation in pca, although it is associated with dense cpg island methylation. there is some controversy regarding which epigenetic alteration arises first and how it relates to effective gene silencing. remarkably, in pca, histone onco-modifications herald cpg methylation in rassf1a downregulation whereas the opposite occurs for gstp <dig> inactivation  <cit> . although either scenario might fit our observations, the occurrence of promoter methylation early in prostate carcinogenesis  and the experimental gene re-expression observed following exposure to epigenetic modulating drugs without significant changes in promoter methylation levels, suggest that cpg methylation precedes histone onco-modifications.

mdr <dig> has been associated with the “multidrug resistance” phenotype  <cit> . thus, from a biological standpoint, it is almost counterintuitive that mdr <dig> gene silencing is associated with pca development and progression as the loss of p-gp expression may be interpreted as an unfavorable change for neoplastic cells. however, even in other tumor models, p-pg expression was found to be higher in localized than in metastatic disease  <cit>  also indicating a connection between p-gp loss of expression and tumor progression. this is also supported by the previous finding that mdr <dig> downregulation was associated with increased cell proliferation and unaltered apoptosis in pca  <cit> . nevertheless, mdr <dig> silencing may also provide a therapeutic opportunity pca treatment. owing to the role of this protein in the removal of xenobiotics  from the intracellular milieu/environment into urine and bile, thus promoting their elimination  <cit>  decreased expression of p-gp is likely to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of cancer patients. this assumption may be of clinical relevance, since castration-resistant pca patients treated with regimens that include taxanes have improved survival rates  <cit> . it is, then, tempting to speculate whether mdr <dig> promoter methylation and/or p-gp expression might constitute biomarkers predictive of response to taxane therapy in pca patients.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that mdr <dig> aberrant promoter methylation and decreased expression are common events in pca. these alterations seem to occur early in prostate carcinogenesis and promoter methylation is associated with clinicopathological features of tumor aggressiveness. although mdr <dig> promoter methylation is inversely correlated with gene expression, effective mdr <dig> silencing is mostly likely due to histone onco-modifications, which may be heralded by cpg methylation at regulatory sites.
