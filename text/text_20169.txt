BACKGROUND
modern dna microarrays permit a comprehensive analysis of quantitative and qualitative changes in rna transcript abundance, outlining the cross-sections of gene expression and alterations of these in response to genetic or environmental stimuli. genome-scale microarrays  are most valuable when screening populations of cells for the novel genes reflecting potential diagnostic and prognostic markers or for an identification of novel therapeutic targets. on the other hand, custom microarray platforms that focus on specific pre-selected subset of genes relevant to a particular field of investigation can be less costly and more suitable for detection of smaller gene expression changes.

microarray technology has added important information on both normal development and pathological changes in neurons. this is well illustrated by multiple studies on substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, which degenerate in parkinson's disease   <cit> . the shortcomings of pharmacological therapies in pd have stimulated a search for alternative treatment strategies. in successful cases, transplants of human embryonic mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons can both restore dopaminergic neurotransmission and provide some symptomatic relief  <cit> . a wider application of neural transplantation in pd is, however, currently not feasible due to the unpredictable and variable outcome, the risks of unwanted side-effects   <cit>  and ethical and practical problems associated with using donor cells obtained from aborted embryos and fetuses  <cit> . human embryonic stem cells  are considered a promising future source of cells for cell replacement therapy in pd and other neurological conditions  <cit> . they could constitute a virtually infinite source of self-renewing cells that can be persuaded to differentiate into specific types of neural cells, including dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms that govern development of cultured hescs into specific types of neural cells are not fully understood. to promote our understanding of such mechanisms, it would be valuable to have tools that readily and reproducibly can help to characterize the cells as they differentiate from pluripotent stem cells into post-mitotic neurons. this important issue was addressed in earlier studies by luo et al. and yang et al., who designed small-to-moderate scale custom microarray platforms   <cit> . in addition superarray bioscience corporation  have manufactured a range of small-scale arrays . we sought to create an improved and updated microarray platform for hesc/neuronal differentiation-oriented gene expression studies. therefore, we generated a specialized large-scale dna microarray platform  that has over  <dig>  pre-selected gene targets and multiple controls spotted in quadruplicates . here we introduce the platform and the advantages it can offers to neuroscientists and stem cell biologists: particularly, in the niche of gene expression-oriented characterization of the samples using an assay of pre-selected, already established gene targets. in the current study, we use the neurostem chip to characterize an undifferentiated population of pluripotent hescs  and compare the gene expression in those cells with that of a hesc-derived cell population rich in neurons, including tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic neurons.

RESULTS
stem cells have unique biological characteristics, but only a limited number of genes are currently recognized as established stem cell markers. examples include pou domain, class  <dig>  transcription factor  <dig> , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor , enk-pending , undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor  <dig>  and dna methyltransferase 3b   <cit> . at the same time, hundreds of genes are suggested as candidate markers for "stemness", but their coupling to the undifferentiated stem cell state is not yet fully verified  <cit> . the concept of "stemness"  is defined as "core stem cell properties that underlie self-renewal and the ability to generate differentiated progeny"  <cit> . considering the complexity of the processes involved, stemness can hardly be ensured by co-operation of just a few genes. nevertheless, three stemness genes  are considered "master"-genes that control the self-renewing process  <cit> . various types of stem cells, such as hematopoietic, mesenchymal and neural , embryonic germ and embryonic carcinoma cells  are all characterized by variations in gene expression profiles, and only a few gene markers are associated with all these cell types  <cit> . we have aimed to embrace the most comprehensive set of those genes into a solitary array, the neurostem chip. thereby, it is possible to employ it to monitor the relative expression levels of numerous known and candidate stemness genes in a single experiment.

similar to the genetic bases underlying stemness, cell differentiation is associated with altered expression levels of certain recognized or candidate genes  <cit> . we therefore incorporated gene markers of development and differentiation in general, and that of neuronal and dopaminergic differentiation in particular, into the neurostem chip. examples include markers for the processes of neuronal maturation, axonal branching, neural/neuronal survival, etc. finally, we ensured that known markers for specific types of neurons, allowing identification of individual cell types, were present on the chip. we paid special attention to genes associated with the differentiation and maturation of dopaminergic neurons. in many published studies, the expression of only a single  or 2– <dig> markers for dopaminergic neurons , dopamine transporter , vesicular monoamine transporter  <dig> ) have been used to indicate dopaminergic identity of neurons. in contrast, the neurostem chip includes oligonucleotide probes for  <dig> genes related to dopaminergic neurons, thus being more comprehensive in this sense, compared to other existing microarray platforms, including focused ones  <cit> . those entries encompass recognized and candidate markers for dopaminergic neurons  and progenitors, as well as markers for the maturation and differentiation of the latter .

the microarray format we selected relies on long oligonucleotide molecules  printed over a solid surface. we spotted the synthesized oligonucleotides  with a constant concentration across the slides, and evaluated the quality and consistency of spotting in a series of control experiments. we then illustrated the utility and technical reliability of the neurostem chip by characterizing the gene expression profile of commonly utilized hesc line sa <dig> , including  undifferentiated cells and  cells committed towards neuronal/dopaminergic differentiation pathway. for the first of these, we used total rna sample purified from hesc colonies that exhibited morphology consistent with cell proliferation and the absence of spontaneous differentiation . we also evaluated the expression of the cell cycle marker ki <dig> and the pluripotency marker oct3/ <dig> in the sample by immunocytochemistry . co-culturing of escs with murine stromal cells  rapidly generates dopaminergic neurons from escs by an unexplained mechanism termed stromal cell-derived inducing activity . we therefore committed hescs toward the neuronal/dopaminergic differentiation pathway by co-culturing with pa <dig> cells for  <dig> days, resulting in appearance of cells positive for early and late neuronal markers, including nestin, β-iii-tubulin, and th, the established marker of dopaminergic neurons . to verify the expression of some key stem cell- and neural phenotype-associated genes we performed rt-pcr comparing rna samples from the undifferentiated hescs with hescs of the same line differentiated toward neuronal/dopaminergic pathway, as described above. the expression profile outlined by rt-pcr confirmed the identity of the sample used . after performing rna integrity tests, we incorporated fluorescent labels to the amplified rna samples from hescs  and cyanine 5-ctp ), hesc-derived cells containing th-positive neurons  and human universal reference rna , and hybridized aliquots with neurostem microarray slides using the following conditions: hesc vs. reference, cy <dig> : cy <dig> =  20: <dig> pmol, and  10: <dig> pmol; and hesc vs. hesc-derived cells, cy <dig> : cy <dig> =  30: <dig> pmol, respectively. universal reference rna has been previously established as a standard reference material for microarray experiments, proving an ability to effectively hybridize to a large fraction of microarray spots  <cit> .

we performed two-color hybridizations  following an established protocol  <cit> , and included dye-flip technical replicates in the analysis . using the online software program base  <cit>  we sequentially filtered the data by background subtraction, negative flagging, negative intensities and for inconsistent data amongst replicates  <cit> . figure 5a shows a comparison of the spot intensities prior to normalization , with the log <dig> of the expression ratio between cy3/cy <dig> being plotted as a function of the log <dig> of the mean of the total expression intensities for cy <dig> and cy <dig> channels. the deviation of the line from zero revealed a need for normalization, so prior to data analyses we normalized signals using a locally weighted scatterplot-smoothing regression  algorithm  implemented in base. since the reproducibility of two-color microarray gene expression data is critically important, we calculated pearson correlation coefficients of the reporters present in the filtered database comparing the average expression ratios . results obtained revealed that data were consistent across technical replicates , showing general high reproducibility: e.g., correlation coefficients were greater than  <dig>  for technical replicates and  <dig>  for dye-swapping samples in hescs vs. universal reference hybridizations . to detect genes with high expression levels in hesc samples, we filtered data for intensity values > <dig> in the hesc sample and performed clustering analysis using the tigr multiexperiment viewer . to visualize variations of spot/reporter per technical replicate, hierarchical clustering was performed by k-means classifier based on the linear-correlation-based distance  method. the optimal number of clusters was determined empirically to produce the most balanced ratio of entries to cluster of highly expressed genes. a cluster of  <dig> genes up-regulated in the hesc sample , was plotted in a centroid graph ; the variation across technical replicates was low. we merged technical replicates to generate a list of the most up-regulated genes expressed in the hesc sample compared to the universal reference rna . standard error of the mean expressed as percentage was calculated for the  <dig> technical replicates, and was  <dig> % for the top  <dig> genes up-regulated in hesc samples, compared to universal reference rna. we performed the analysis of microarray data, as described in the methods, and spot error values were generally in the lower range, indicating high stringency of the signals and low variance.

as seen in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  the neurostem chip identified numerous genes associated with stem cells. in particular, homeo box expressed in es cells  <dig>  gene was identified as the most up-regulated in the es cell preparation, compared to universal reference rna. highly expressed in pluripotent escs, hesx <dig> expression is down-regulated upon embryonic stem cell differentiation  <cit> , as also clearly seen in differentiation experiment of our own . similarly, gremlin  <dig> homolog, cysteine knot superfamily gene  is a recognized factor of cell-fate determination of escs  <cit> . many more genes highly up-regulated in the hesc sample in comparison with universal reference rna are associated with stem cells: further examples include gap junction protein α <dig>  and zic family member  <dig> heterotaxy  <dig>    <cit> . the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  is of particular interest. basic fibroblast growth factor  supports hesc proliferation and their ability to maintain undifferentiated phenotype when cultured in vitro  <cit> . moreover, in some hesc lines a very high concentration of fgf <dig> could substitute for the need of feeder cells  <cit> . at the same time, genes listed in table  <dig> represent the most highly up-regulated entries in a relatively limited group of genes . many other genes involved in maintenance of esc phenotype  have lower levels of expression . examples include undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor  <dig> , dna methyltransferase 3b , developmental pluripotency associated  <dig>  and numerous candidate markers of "stemness": e.g. genes for kiaa <dig> protein, forkhead box o1a , high-mobility group box  <dig> , c-terminal binding protein  <dig>  and left-right determination factor  <dig> , as well as others. for numerous established or candidate markers of stem cells the expression levels were not considerably higher  in the hesc sample compared to the universal reference rna. for example, the expression of nanog, dna -methyltransferase 3α , muts homolog  <dig>  colon cancer, nonpolyposis type  <dig>  , thy- <dig> cell surface antigen , high-mobility group box  <dig> , transcription factor  <dig> , nanos homolog  <dig> , myod family inhibitor , calumenin  and soluble thymidine kinase  <dig>  was detected in hes sa <dig> cells with log <dig> ratio value <  <dig>  expression levels of those genes range from being inconsiderably higher to nearly equal to that in universal reference rna sample. we believe that those findings could be explained by cellular composition of human universal reference rna sample  <cit> , which includes pooled rna samples from proliferating cells . thus, the relative difference between gene expression of certain markers of stem cells in undifferentiated hescs and universal reference rna is naturally decreased. taken together, the gene expression signature of hes sa <dig> cell line profiled by neurostem chip is indeed characteristic for pluripotent stem cells, providing proof-of-concept.

notably, comparison of expression profiles of undifferentiated hescs and hesc-derived cells committed toward dopaminergic differentiation pathway by co-culturing with sdia for  <dig> days have revealed that many of the stem cell marker genes mentioned above were down-regulated in differentiation . expectedly, hesx <dig>  grem <dig>  dnmt3b, utf <dig> and nanog could be listed among these. at the same time, numerous other genes, including pitx <dig>  dlk <dig> and msx <dig> were up-regulated in the latter sample . table  <dig> lists  <dig> dopaminergic system-related entries  with gene expression up-regulated by day  <dig> of hesc differentiation protocol; few more genes have demonstrated less prominent up-regulation . the gene expression profiles generated are therefore consistent with the results of earlier studies utilizing hsc-derived samples with similar characteristics  <cit> . diversity of neurostem chip entries responsive to hesc commitment toward neuronal/dopaminergic differentiation pathway clearly illustrates the complexity of that pathway. the cell population obtained after  <dig> day exposure to sdia is highly heterogeneous. only around  <dig> % of the cells are th-positive cells . this heterogeneity, with an apparent presence of residual pluripotent cells explains the presence of stem cell marker genes, including homeobox transcription factor nanog, as revealed by rt-pcr data . it would be therefore impossible to apply the platform to identify novel genes associated with the process of differentiation; for that application, the genome-scale microarray platforms  are clearly superior. nevertheless, being based upon a moderate assay of pre-selected specific gene targets, the comparative analysis of microarray data derived from undifferentiated and dopaminergic differentiate pathway-committed hescs provides a valuable cross-cut of complex relationship between factors driving or indicative to neuronal/dopaminergic differentiation .

rt-pcr analyses have validated the overall reliability of neurostem microarray platform: all of the entries detected in the hybridization experiments have demonstrated similar trends when analyzed by rt-pcr means . those entries include sox <dig>  en <dig> and nanog , gadph, aldh1a <dig>  sdha, tubb and nestin , actb, th, msx <dig> and pitx <dig> . some of the housekeeping genes  have somewhat different expression in undifferentiated vs. differentiated cells, consistent with previous reports on certain established housekeeping genes  being variable in human samples  <cit> . importantly, all the observed gene expression trends were similar in both microarray and rt-pcr. our experiment therefore confirms that the neurostem chip microarray platform can still identify gene expression changes related to early stages of differentiation of hesc into dopaminergic neurons.

CONCLUSIONS
recent technological advances have led to dna microarrays which contain over hundred thousand of spots of dna material, reaching a truly genomic scale. highly specialized dna microarrays of smaller scale  still have an important role in the directed studies in particular fields. since they are significantly less expensive, compared to many recognized large-scale platforms , they have a clear advantage in routine work involving samples from, e.g., multiple cell culture conditions. while there is a risk that one will miss out on changes in genes previously not believed to be relevant to neural differentiation, the restricted number of genes in the neurostem chip also simplifies analysis and adds power. neurostem chip is comparable to other stem cell-related focused microarray platforms in regards to manufacturing costs and technical simplicity of the recommended hybridization protocols. at the same time, it currently implies an advantage in both the scale and the spectrum of pre-selected, specific gene targets assayed. some suggested areas of application for neurostem microarray platform could be the following:  characterization of the expression of established, pre-selected gene targets in human stem cell  lines, including newly derived ones,  longitudinal quality control for maintained hsc populations,  following gene expression changes during differentiation under defined cell culture conditions, and  confirming the success of differentiation into specific neuronal subtypes. in addition, the neurostem chip can be used to characterize gene changes in intracerebral grafts of human cells, even when they are transplanted into experimental animals.

we specifically wish to stress that we are about to make the neurostem chip available at a non-profit cost to the research community. we believe it has the potential to become an important screening tool in the expanding field of hsc studies in application to neurological/neurodegenerative disorders.
