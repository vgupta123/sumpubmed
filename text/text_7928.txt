BACKGROUND
sporadic infections of humans by swine influenza viruses have been reported from the united states and worldwide, mostly from classical swine influenza  <cit> . during the late nineties multiple subtypes of triple reassortants influenza viruses with genes from avian, human and pig origin emerged and became predominant in north american swine  <cit> . triple reassortant h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> subtypes occasionally infected humans but human to human transmission was rare and always very limited. however, disease severity and clinical out-come was always unpredictable  <cit> . in april  <dig> a h1n <dig> triple reassortant swine influenza virus infected humans in north america  <cit>  and continued to effectively transmit from human to humans . the virus spread rapidly within mexico and with some delay across the united states before spread to other continents. from  <dig> april to  <dig> august  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> specimens tested positive for influenza and were reported to flu-net by  <dig> countries, areas and territories  <cit> . as a result, who declared the virus a pandemic threat. while most fatal cases occurred in mexico and the united states, the virus appeared to be less aggressive in europe and asia. the rapid spread of this swine influenza virus mainly among young healthy adults and outside of the classical influenza season added to the unpredictability of this virus. thus the virus and its molecular evolution raise a number of questions that are of prime international public health concern.

recently, we applied the informational spectrum method  bioinformatics platform  <cit> , for analysis of the structure and function of the ha subunit  <dig>  of h5n <dig> influenza viruses. results of this analysis revealed that ha <dig> of h5n <dig> viruses encodes specific and highly conserved information which may determine the recognition and targeting of these highly pathogenic avian influenza  viruses to their receptor  <cit> . we also showed that a subset of h5n <dig> in egypt may be evolving toward an h1n1-like receptor usage, indicating more efficient human-to-human transmission  <cit> . this prediction is in accord with recently observed h5n <dig> subclinical cases in egypt. this silent spread of h5n <dig> in human populations sets the stage for increased transmission efficiencies and represents another threat with pandemic potential.

here we used the ism platform to compare north american swine h1n1/n <dig> influenza viruses with the new pandemic a/h1n <dig> virus. our results showed that both groups of viruses differed in conserved characteristics that reflect a distinct propensity of these viruses to undergo a specific interaction with swine or human host proteins or receptors. swine h1n1/n <dig> viruses that sporadically infected humans featured both the swine and the human interaction pattern. furthermore, we identified several amino acid positions that are predicted to be "hot-spots" for polymorphisms which could increase human infectivity of a/h1n <dig> virus. at least one of these residues has already emerged in the a/h1n <dig> isolates from spain, italy and usa.

informational spectrum method
it has been proposed that the number of valence electrons and the electron-ion interaction potential  representing the main energy term of valence electrons are essential physical parameters determining of the long-range properties of biological molecules  <cit> . the eiip can be determined for organic molecules by the following simple equation derived from the "general model pseudopotential"  <cit> :

   

where z* is the average quasivalence number  determined by

   

where zi is the valence number of the i-th atomic component, ni is the number of atoms of the i-th component, m is the number of atomic components in the molecule, and nis the total number of atoms. the eiip values calculated according to equations  and  are in rydbergs .

the eiip parameter was used as a basis of the informational spectrum method  for structure/function analysis of proteins, analysis of protein - protein interaction and de novo design of biologically active peptides . here we will only briefly present this bioinformatics method.

a sequence of n residues is represented as a linear array of n terms, with each term given a weight. the weight assigned to a residue is its eiip value , determining electronic properties of amino acids, which are responsible for their intermolecular interactions . in this way the amino acid sequence is transformed into a sequence of numbers. this numerical sequence, representing the primary structure of the protein, is then subjected to a discrete fourier transformation, which is defined as follows:

   

where x is the m-th member of a given numerical series, n is the total number of points in this series, and x are discrete fourier transformation coefficients. these coefficients describe the amplitude, phase and frequency of sinusoids, which comprised the original signal. the absolute value of a complex discrete fourier transformation defines the amplitude spectrum and the phase spectrum. the complete information about the original sequence is contained in both spectral functions. however, in the case of protein analysis, relevant information is presented in an energy density spectrum, which is defined as follows:

   

in this way, sequences are analyzed as discrete signals. it is assumed that their points are equidistant with the distance d =  <dig>  the maximal frequency in a spectrum defined as above is f = 1/ <dig> d =  <dig> . the frequency range is independent of the total number of points in the sequence. the total number of points in a sequence influences only the resolution of the spectrum. the resolution of the n-point sequence is 1/n. the n-th point in the spectral function corresponds to a frequency f = nf = n/n. thus, the initial information defined by the sequence of amino acids can now be presented in the form of the informational spectrum , representing the series of frequencies and their amplitudes.

the is frequencies correspond to the distribution of structural motifs with defined physicochemical properties determining a biological function of a protein. when comparing proteins, which share the same biological or biochemical function, the ism technique allows detection of code/frequency pairs which are specific for their common biological properties, or which correlate with their specific interaction. these common informational characteristics of sequences are determined by cross-spectrum or consensus informational spectrum . a cis of n spectra is obtained by the following equation:

   

where Î  is the j-th element of the i-th power spectrum and c is the j-th element of cis. thus, cis is the fourier transform of the correlation function for the spectrum. thus, any spectral component  not present in all compared informational spectra is eliminated. peak frequencies in cis are common frequency components for the analyzed sequences. a measure of similarity for each peak is a signal-to-noise ratio , which represents a ratio between signal intensity at one particular is frequency and the main value of the whole spectrum. if one calculates a cis for a group of proteins, which have different primary structures, and finds strictly defined peak frequencies, it means that the primary structures of the analyzed proteins encode the same information. it has been demonstrated that: 1) such a peak exists only for a group of proteins with the same biological function; 2) no significant peaks exist for biologically unrelated proteins; 3) peak frequencies are different for different biological functions. furthermore, it was shown that the proteins and their targets  have the same characteristic frequency in common  <cit> . thus, it can be postulated that is frequencies not only characterize general function but also recognition and interaction between a particular protein and its target. once the characteristic frequency for a particular protein function/interaction is identified, it is possible then to utilize the ism approach to predict the amino acids in the sequence, which essentially contribute to this frequency and are likely to be crucial for the observed function  <cit> . the server for free on-line ism analysis can be accessed at  and  <cit> .

RESULTS
phylogeny and principal component cluster analysis revealed that the h gene of a/h1n <dig> is most closely related to the triple reassortants swine influenza h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> found in north america since  <dig> . these results, suggesting that a/h1n <dig> emerged from this cluster of viruses, are consistent with the recently reported findings of trifonov and co-workers  <cit> . the h genes of swine h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> from north america were analyzed by the ism and compared to a/h1n <dig> strains. figure  <dig> shows the typical is profile of a selected virus  as well as the cumulated cis  of all viruses of each group.

the cis of ha <dig> of swine h1n2/h1n <dig> and a/h1n <dig> strains have characteristic dominant peaks at the is frequencies f and f, respectively . according to the ism concept this reflects a differential interaction pattern of the ha <dig> of the two groups of viruses. the tropism of the viruses suggests that a high amplitude at f corresponds to a higher propensity to interact with swine protein while the high amplitude at f may correspond to a preferred interaction with human protein. cis of the ha <dig> gene of swine h1n <dig> viruses isolated from humans in us  contains characteristic peaks at both frequencies f and f . this suggests that these viruses, that sporadically infected humans, display both the distinct "swine" interaction pattern shared with the swine h1n1/n <dig> viruses and the characteristic "human" interaction pattern shared with a/h1n <dig> viruses. thus, these three groups of viruses have a distinct propensity to interact with swine and human proteins which can be described by ism analysis. these results also provide additional strong evidence that ha <dig> from swine viruses infecting humans in the us before  <dig> were the likely precursors of a/h1n <dig> 

changes in h1n1/n <dig> viruses that lead to enhanced transmission in humans are of particular interest. the comparison of ha <dig> sequences of h1n1/n <dig> viruses which infected only swine with the early mexican a/h1n <dig> strain a/mexico/4115/ <dig> revealed  <dig> amino acid substitutions which are highly specific for a/h1n <dig> viruses .

mutations present in swine h1n1/n <dig> strains which infect humans are marked with asterisk.

we further investigated which of these mutations or combinations thereof are most important for the switch between interaction patterns from swine h1n1/n <dig> to a/h1n <dig> strains. as shown above, the interaction between h1n1/n <dig> and swine protein, and the interaction between a/h1n <dig> and human protein are characterized by the frequencies f and f, respectively. according to the ism concept  <cit>  mutations in ha <dig> which increase the amplitude at f and decrease amplitude at f would potentially contribute to the switch of the viral host tropism from swine to human. seven of the  <dig> mutations presented in table  <dig>  increase amplitude on the f and decrease amplitude on f, suggesting that these mutations may be critical for the switch of h1n1/n <dig> from a swine to a human tropism. it is of note that three of these mutations  also are present in swine h1n <dig> viruses that infected humans in the us between  <dig> and  <dig> . ism analysis also showed that any of the combinations of the mutations f71s, t128s, e302k and m314l, that are only present in a/h1n <dig>  decrease the amplitude in f and increase the amplitude in f. this suggests that these four mutations may play an important role in the efficient infection of humans by a/h1n <dig>  and perhaps the effective human to human transmission. it is of interest to note that  <dig> of  <dig> mutations presented in table  <dig> decrease amplitude on f and increase amplitude on f,  <dig> mutations decrease amplitudes on both frequencies or have no effect, and only one  increases the amplitude on f and decreases amplitude on f. this suggests that the mutations in a/h1n <dig> that predispose for the human interaction pattern are remarkable of more prevalent than mutations that predispose for the swine interaction pattern.

it can be expected that a/h1n <dig> strains will accumulate additional polymorphisms in their ha <dig> genes which further favor the "human" interaction pattern and according to the ism concept would be associated with an increase of the amplitude at frequency f and decrease the amplitude at f. to identify candidate residues  for such polymorphisms, we performed an in silico alanine scan of the complete ha <dig>  this analysis revealed that mutations of residues 94d, 196d and 274d would increase the amplitude at the critical frequency f . since asp has the highest eiip value  substitutions in any of the above positions will increase the amplitude at frequency f. interestingly, asp  in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is highly conserved in all north american swine h1n1/n <dig> strains and in all a/h1n <dig> ha <dig> genes. the only notable exceptions are four a/h1n <dig> isolates from spain , two isolates from italy  and four isolates from us  that have a d274e mutation . this mutation significantly increases the amplitude on the frequency f and probably enhances the "human" interaction pattern. the same result was obtained for scan with any other amino acid with exception of asp . as can be seen in figure 3b, a/castilla-la mancha/gp13/ <dig>  which is identical to a/south carolina/09/ <dig>  differ from the early mexican a/h1n <dig> isolates a/mexico/4115/ <dig>  only in positions i32l and e257d. the amino acids l and i have the same eiip value  and the l>i substitution does not affect the informational spectrum. in contrast, the eiip values of amino acids d and e are significantly different  and the d>e mutation increases the amplitude at frequency f by 15%, with little effect on structural properties of the protein since both amino acids are negatively charged. the stable mutation d274e found in us, spain and italy may correspond to further adaptation of a/h1n <dig> to humans. interestingly, spain was also one of the first  countries with indigenous chains of transmission, at a time when in other countries the virus was mostly found in imported cases.

the computer scanning survey of the ha <dig> amino acid sequence of a/h1n <dig> strains showed that the main contribution to the information represented by the frequency f comes from a domain located in the c-terminus of the protein which encompasses residues  <dig> -  <dig>  of the mature protein. figure  <dig>  shows is and position of the vin <dig> domain in the 3d structure of a/h1n <dig> isolate a/california/04/ <dig>  it is of note that vin <dig> is conserved in all a/h1n <dig> and that two of the four polymorphisms  which are identified as critical for human infection are located within this domain. the significance of these polymorphisms are strengthened by the fact that domain  <dig> -  <dig> also is highly conserved in ha <dig> of swine viruses .

the relative position of the receptor binding domain and the receptor targeting domain  in 3d structure of a/h1n <dig> ha <dig> is similar to the position of these two domains in seasonal flu h1n <dig> viruses but different than in h1n <dig>  <dig> viruses  <cit> . this suggests that efficacy of interaction between a/h1n <dig> and its receptor is similar to seasonal flu h1n <dig> viruses but less efficient than in  <dig> viruses.

CONCLUSIONS
analyses by the ism bioinformatics platform of the ha <dig> protein of north american swine h1n <dig> and h1n <dig> viruses and the new a/h1n <dig> that emerged recently in mexico and the usa showed that both groups of viruses differed in characteristic parameters that reflect a distinct propensity of these viruses to undergo a specific interaction with swine or human host proteins or receptors. using the same approach, amino acid substitutions f71s, t128s, e302k, m314l in the a/h1n <dig> ha <dig> essential for the human interaction pattern of these viruses were identified and residues 94d, 196d and 274d of a/h1n <dig> ha <dig> were predicted as "hot-spots" for mutations that may significantly increase the propensity of this virus to interact preferentially with human host proteins. at least one of these mutations  was already found in the a/h1n <dig> isolates from spain, italy and us, suggesting the virus further adapts to the human host. in addition, it has been suggested that the highly conserved domain  <dig> -  <dig> of ha <dig> plays an important role in a/h1n1-receptor interaction and represents a candidate target for diagnostics, vaccines and therapies.
