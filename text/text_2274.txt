BACKGROUND
there is increasing evidence that many, if not the majority, of mutations that give rise to variation in complex traits reside in regulatory elements that alter gene expression . mutations in putative regulatory regions have been associated with >  <dig> phenotypes in human and other species  <cit>  including the classic blond hair phenotype found in northern europeans  and stature in cattle .

mutations that affect the expression of an allele on the same chromosome are known as cis expression quantitative trait loci . if an individual is heterozygous for such a mutation it is expected that the two alleles of the gene will be expressed unequally causing allelic imbalance or allele specific expression . this ase can be detected using rna sequencing  provided there is a heterozygous site in the coding sequence of the gene. ase can also be caused by imprinting where an epigenetic mark distinguishes the paternal and maternal chromosomes and causes them to be expressed unequally. evidence is accumulating from studies in mice and humans that regulatory variation that affects the level of expression, observed as allele specific expression or allelic imbalance, is extremely common. for example crowley et al.  <cit>  reported that greater than 80 % of mouse genes have cis regulatory variation, and estimates from humans and mice range from  <dig> to 89 % for the proportion of genes showing ase in at least one tissue .

ase has been evaluated in a number of studies in humans and mouse, the most extensive being that most recently published by the gtex consortium  <cit>  in humans. the gtex consortium used rnaseq data from  <dig> solid organ tissues,  <dig> brain sub-regions, whole blood, lymphoblastoid cell lines  and skin fibroblast cells to study gene expression, including ase within tissue. they tested for ase in snp that were both heterozygous and had greater than  <dig> rnaseq reads, however they only did this within sample, and found that  <dig> – <dig>  % of snp tested showed ase. investigating the extent and patterns of ase in species other than humans and mice, would give insights into the evolution of regulatory variation. here we report on the extent and pattern of ase across  <dig> tissues in a single cow.

even within humans and mice, let alone other species, there are a number of questions concerning ase that have only partial answers to date. for instance, to what extent is ase tissue specific; how often does the direction of imbalance reverse between tissues; how often is only one of the two alleles expressed ; is there a bias towards expression of the paternal or maternal allele; and do genes that are nearby on a chromosome share the same direction of ase? as we have profiled ase across so many tissues, our results provide new insights into these questions. as observed for human and mouse, we found pervasive ase. the majority of ase was tissue specific. and we also found that more than half of all genes show divergent allele specific patterns across tissues, expressing the paternal allele more highly in one tissue and the maternal allele more highly in another tissue. further, we found many cases of runs of consecutive genes on a chromosome that were expressed from the same chromosome  in a tissue specific manner. our design does not allow us to distinguish ase due to cis eqtl from that due to imprinting but we report ase results separately for a group of genes known to be imprinted in cattle, mouse and human and find a complex pattern showing a degree of ase that varies between tissues.

in order to assess the extent of ase within and across tissues in a novel outbred species, namely cattle, we collected  <dig> tissues at a single point in time from one lactating cow. this paper presents results of differences in gene expression between these tissues – the first bovine gene expression atlas using rnaseq data. we then present the discovery of genes showing ase and present the extent and relationship of this ase across tissues. ase was assessed by mapping to parental genomes of the cow sampled, allowing us to minimise any reference bias  <cit> . we then validate some of these findings in a dataset consisting of two tissues sampled from  <dig> lactating cows.

RESULTS
between six and  <dig> million paired sequence reads were generated per library, with three replicate samples for each of the eighteen tissues investigated , resulting in between  <dig> and  <dig> million paired sequence reads per tissue. on average 92 % of reads aligned to the reference genome for each library, with greater than 70 % mapping uniquely . reads mapping to ribosomal rna  genes accounted for less than  <dig>  % of total reads for each sample indicating minimal rrna contamination during library preparation. mean coverage of expressed transcripts , showed coverage biased toward the 3’ end of transcripts. this is illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and formally confirmed by a significant regression showing that more reads came from the later exons within a gene . this bias is likely a result of some degraded mrna being sequenced but is small and unlikely to affect subsequent results.

tissue specific expression 
rnaseq reads from each library were aligned to the ensemble annotation of umd <dig>  bovine reference genome. the total number of expressed genes in each tissue were similar , with mammary gland having the lowest  and thymus the highest  number of expressed genes. within a tissue, the number of reads per gene followed a log-normal distribution , with many genes contributing close to the average number of reads  but a few genes contributing  <dig> times more or  <dig> times fewer than the average number of reads. as expected transcripts from mammary gland were dominated by the major milk proteins, with 62 % of transcripts from alpha s <dig> , alpha s <dig> , beta  or kappa  casein genes, reducing the number of genes observed with low expression. on the other hand thymus was a tissue with high coverage , and this could mean that it had more low abundant transcripts sequenced accounting for the large number of genes expressed.

a tissue by gene counts matrix was produced and used to perform differential expression  analysis in which genes that were more expressed in a tissue than in all other tissues , or less often expressed than in other tissues  were identified. with the exception of blood and leg muscle, all other tissues had a greater number of up-regulated genes than down-regulated . a full list of the genes de per tissue is contained in additional file 2: table s <dig>  when tissues were clustered on their gene expression patterns, using the full normalised count matrix for all genes, tissues were largely grouped together into clusters reflecting their biological relationship, for example muscle tissues clustered together, brain tissues clustered together and skin tissues clustered together . liver and blood were both different from the rest of the tissues and each other, as indicated by the height of the dendrogram branches.fig.  <dig> the number of genes up or down regulated with significant  tissue specific expression  and a greater than two-fold difference in expression, when compared to the average expression of that gene across all other tissues

functional annotation of the de genes in each tissue  identified many of the biological processes and pathways already reported as having an established role in those particular tissues. for example, in black skin many of the genes such as keratins, keratin associated proteins and dermal allergen genes have known roles in the skin and this was reflected in the enrichment of gene ontology  terms for the biological processes ‘epidermis development’, ‘ectoderm development’, ‘hair follicle development’ and ‘keratinization’. the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes  pathway ‘melanogenesis’, responsible for the deposition of melanin in the skin, is also enriched in the de genes from black skin. for mammary gland the casein genes, alpha lactalbumin  and lactoperoxidase  all have well defined roles in the mammary gland. the significantly enriched go terms ‘epithelium development’, ‘epithelial cell differentiation’, ‘tissue development’ and the kegg pathway ‘tight junction’, all reflect the mammary gland epithelial cell and tight junction formation, all vital for milk secretion. the go term ‘defence response to bacterium’ is a term that reflects the need for mammary tissue to constantly fight bacterial infections which can occur through the teat canal.

counts were also made on an exon basis and this enabled us to ask whether some exons within a gene were more highly expressed than others, and did this vary between tissues? to summarise the sources of variation in transcription the model y = μ + tissue + replicate + tissue. replicate + exonnumber. tissue + gene + gene. exon + gene. tissue + exon number + error  was fitted, where y = log, and the variance accounted for by each random effect  in the model was estimated . all fixed effects  had highly significant f values. the gene.exon effect accounted for the largest amount of variance , followed by the gene effect . the large variance in expression between genes reflects the fact that some genes are highly expressed in all tissues, and others genes are expressed at low levels. the smaller gene.tissue effect  reflects differences between tissues in the genes that are highly expressed. the large gene.exon effect is due to the fact that some exons within a gene had much higher counts than other exons within the same gene regardless of tissue, even after accounting for any 3’ bias in coverage of transcripts  by fitting exon number  in the model. this large gene.exon effect implies there could have been a lot of alternative splicing, or alternatively that the annotation of the bovine genome was poor, so that some exons weren’t real or were only occasionally being transcribed. the effect of exon number is due to a bias towards sequencing more exons toward the 3’ end of the gene. this bias varies between tissues , where adrenal gland was the most affected  and therefore had the largest effect and mammary and blood were the least affected  and had the smallest effect of this bias.

extent of allele specific expression across tissues
we had access to unambiguously phased genotypes for all heterozygous variants in the cow’s whole genome sequence, where these variants were homozygous in the whole genome sequence of her sire. as a result we were able to map reads to parental genomes  <cit> , to determine snp and genes showing ase in the  <dig> bovine tissues. rnaseq reads from the three replicate libraries were merged and aligned to two parental genomes . for all known heterozygous sites that occurred within an exon, allele counts for each alignment were extracted and ase tested using a chi-squared test  that accounts for any remaining mapping bias. there was very little bias toward the reference allele for all  <dig>  snp tested . the exception to this was for snps that showed mono-allelic expression, it was more often the reference allele than the alternative allele that was expressed . this could be due to errors in the genome sequence of this cow, with snp called heterozygous when in fact the cow is homozygous at that position. such artefacts were also observed by baran et al.  <cit>  in the  <dig> human genome whole genome sequence data and genotype-tissue expression  rnaseq data. so the following efforts were made to identify and remove sequencing errors, 1) “private” variant detection was undertaken for this cow, and any snp that were not discovered in that private detection removed, 2) variants only detected in this cow’s genome and not in any other animal in the  <dig> bull genomes project  were removed, 3) putative runs of homozygosity  were identified in whole genome sequence data and heterozygous variants falling within those regions were removed using an approach similar to macleod et al.  <cit> . after these quality control steps, there was only a slight bias towards expression of the reference allele  and this was eliminated when the mae classes were removed from the data .fig.  <dig> distribution of reference allele frequency after removing snp that were likely to be a sequencing error, within tissue type, for all snp tested for ase. if there was significant mapping bias still present after mapping to the two parental genomes the distribution of allele frequencies would be skewed toward the reference allele. instead it followed a normal distribution with a peak at reference allele frequency of  <dig> , except for those snp with reference allele frequency of  <dig> or  <dig>  as discussed in the text these represent snp that display monoallelic expression and even though attempts were made to remove snp that were due to sequencing errors, higher peaks at reference allele frequency of  <dig>  as compared with  <dig>  indicate some still remain



in total  <dig>  heterozygous snp within  <dig> genes were tested for ase in at least one tissue. 89 % of these  <dig> genes tested had at least one snp with significant ase, in at least one tissue . wang et al.  <cit>  state that genes with multiple snp supporting ase have a higher rate of successful verification. although, a large proportion  of the genes had only  <dig> snp within the gene able to be tested, we found ase for  <dig> of  <dig> genes with greater than one snp tested . therefore we estimate that between  <dig> and 89 % of genes show ase in at least one tissue and we conclude that ase is pervasive in cattle. this estimate is higher than the majority of published literature of  <dig> to 53 %  from whole genome assessment of ase. the notable exception is the recent publication from crowley et al.  <cit>  which reported 89 % of all genes tested in mouse brain showed ase.table  <dig> allele specific expression analysis results, the number of snp tested and the number and proportion that showed significant ase  in each tissue and in total. also the number of genes containing snp tested for ase  and genes containing greater than one snp tested for ase  and then the number and proportion that contained snp significant for ase  and the number and proportion that contained greater than one snp significant for ase  in each tissue and in total. then finally the number and proportion of genes tested that showed significant ase in at least one but not all tissues tested  in each tissue and in total



using only those snp where parental origin could be definitively determined, and where more than  <dig> snp was tested within a gene, we found 72 % overall agreement, up to 82 % in thymus, regarding which allele  was expressed between snp in the same gene , and even better agreement where snp were in the same exon . it is worth noting that lung and liver had the lowest concordance between snp within the same genes and these are the two tissues with the highest proportion of genes showing ase . it is evident from fig.  <dig> that where neighbouring snp within a gene are both significantly ase both express the same parental allele, and at very similar frequencies. however it also shows that in a few cases ase switched between maternal and paternal expression within the gene. this is clearly demonstrated for individual genes in detail in additional file 1: figure s3a. clearly here we can see that some genes showed consistent parental allelic expression across the gene, whereas in other cases the expression changes from one parental allele to another within the gene . such patterns of expression have been previously reported by wood et al.  <cit>  in human brain and liver and are indicative of allele specific isoform expression. as will be discussed later even the same gene showed different patterns of expression across all  <dig> tissues types .table  <dig> using definitively phased snp this table shows the number of genes and exons with greater than one snp in them and the number and proportion of those tested where the same parental allele was expressed, i.e. the snp were concordant

fig.  <dig> using only snp that could be definitively phased and that occurred in genes with  <dig> or more snp, these plots for mammary gland, thyroid, brain caudal lobe and brain cerebellum show the paternal allele frequency for neighbouring snp within a gene. red points are those where both snp were significantly ase, blue points are those where only snp <dig> was significantly ase, green points are those where only snp <dig> was significantly ase, grey points are where neither snp was significantly ase



for individual tissues the proportion of genes showing significant ase varied from as low as 8–16 % of those tested in thymus to as high as 71–82 % of those tested in lung . pant et al.  <cit>  reported 53 % of genes tested showed significant ase when testing  <dig> genes in human white blood cells. our estimate of 21–33 % of genes tested in white blood cells was lower but we tested more genes . gao et al.  <cit>  reported 30 % of the  <dig> genes tested in human mammary epithelial cell lines showed significant ase, which agrees well with 16–31 % of the  <dig> genes tested in mammary gland in this study. our results in lung indicate that 71–82 % of  <dig> genes tested showed significant ase in this tissue, the highest of any tissue tested. this is much higher than the 2 % of snp showing ase estimated by the gtex consortium  <cit> , however we tested many more snp and the gtex consortium tested only snp that were in common across samples and reported only the within sample estimate of ase. our estimate of 14– <dig> and 14–26 % of the  <dig> and  <dig> genes tested in brain caudal lobe and brain cerebellum respectively are much lower than the estimate of 89 % by crowley et al.  <cit>  in whole mouse brain, however they had an extremely powerful design testing ase in greater than  <dig>  genes in  <dig> individuals from all possible pairwise crosses between the three divergent inbred lines, as opposed to the single outbred individual tested here. the power of our study comes from testing many tissues, as did gregg et al.  <cit>  who tested  <dig> tissue samples in mouse, all from the mouse brain, and the gtex consortium  <cit>  which tested  <dig> different tissue samples from  <dig> humans. the gtex consortium estimated  <dig>  –  <dig>  % of snp tested showed ase, however they only tested an average of  <dig> snp, a lot less than that tested here, and a lot less than crowley et al.  <cit> , and their estimates are within sample within tissue and not across all sample and tissues as is reported by crowley et al. and this study.

of the genes showing significant ase, 94 % displayed ase in only a subset of the tissues they were expressed in . figure 5a demonstrates that ase was correlated between tissues, where red indicates ase was correlated, and white indicates it was not. the tissues are clustered based on their ase and the variability in ase between tissues is represented by the height of the dendrogram branches. tissues with similar function, such as black and white skin, cluster together as they did with gene expression . however some ase relationships are different to what they were for gene expression, i.e., heart does not cluster with the other muscle samples for ase, while it did for gene expression, indicating tissue specific differences in ase. interestingly lung, liver and kidney show very little correlation of ase with any other tissues or with each other, these tissues showed the highest levels of ase. of the  <dig> genes expressed in more than one tissue showing ase, and where the major allele’s parental origin could be determined ,  <dig>  genes showed divergent allele specific patterns, that is the major allele expressed was not the same across all tissues. this was previously demonstrated in additional file 1: figure s3a. an example of a single snp is given in fig. 6a for a snp in gene spty2d <dig>  where the paternal allele is expressed in kidney and thymus  and maternal allele in the brain caudal lobe and brain cerebellum . mutations in spty2d <dig>  have been associated with lipid levels in humans in multiple studies  <cit> , and interestingly guo et al.  <cit>  suggested this association might be sex specific. additional file 1: figure s3b, c, d and e shows examples of ase patterns across tissues for multiple snp within the genes gbp <dig>  prune <dig> , sgol <dig> and samd <dig>  they demonstrate that allele specific expression patterns within genes and across tissues can be extremely divergent and complex, when looking at multiple snp in many tissues.fig.  <dig> heat maps of tissue-to-tissue distances generated by applying the ‘dist’ function in r to the transpose of a matrix, as defined for each heat map. for each heat map, the variability between tissues is measured by the height of the dendrogram branches. the colour key indicates the distance between tissues with red being the least distant  and white being the most distant . a uses a snp by tissue matrix containing the paternal allele frequency of all ase snp, therefore displaying the correlation of ase between tissues. b uses a snp by tissue matrix in which snp were assigned “1” if mono-allelic and “0” if not, therefore displaying the correlation of mae between tissues. c uses a gene by tissue matrix in which genes classified as maternal were assigned “- <dig> ”, genes classified as paternal were assigned a value of “ <dig> ” and genes that could not be classified or were not expressed were assigned “0”, therefore displaying the correlation of paternal ase between tissues. d uses a gene by tissue matrix in which all genes in “runs” of  <dig> or more  were designated a value of “1” and genes not in a run were designated “0”, therefore displaying the between tissue correlation of genes falling into runs of greater than  <dig> or more expressing the same allele

tissue specific ase  has been reported previously. one of the most extensive tests, by keane et al.  <cit> , performed rnaseq in a single f <dig> mouse and tested  <dig> genes across  <dig> tissues and found that 95 % of genes showing ase did so in a tissue specific manner. another by pinter et al.  <cit>  performed rnaseq in a reciprocal cross between two mouse strains, testing  <dig> genes across two tissues and found 82 % of ase genes showed ts ase. keane et al.  <cit>  and pinter et al.  <cit>  also found that  <dig> and 21 % of ase genes showed divergent allele specific patterns.

interestingly we found that there are ten genes that show ase exclusively in mammary gland, zmynd <dig>  clspn*, slc30a2*, tectb*, sertad <dig>  znf <dig>  aldh3b2*, cidea*, tff1* and one uncharacterized protein*. seven of these genes are differentially expressed when compared with all other tissues  and all seven are up regulated. these genes have functions associated with mammary development, involution, or milk nutrition; zmynd <dig>  clspn, tff <dig>  affect proliferation or apoptosis of mammary cells ; slc30a <dig> transports zinc from the mammary gland into milk  <cit> ; cidea is a transcriptional coactivator regulating mammary gland secretion of milk lipids  <cit> ; and tff <dig> is a gastrointestinal protective peptide secreted into milk  <cit> . genes that show ase exclusively in one tissue are often the genes that are differentially expressed, when comparing that tissue with all other tissues . this is a theme which is consistent across all tissues . this could simply be because we have greater power to detect ase in highly expressed genes. however, it may also be that genes that are highly expressed in a particular tissue are likely to be regulated by multiple sites in the surrounding dna and these sites are likely to contain at least one snp which is heterozygous. all genes that show exclusive ts ase are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  there were some highly expressed genes that did not show significant ase, such as alpha s <dig> casein  and beta casein  which are two of the major milk proteins highly expressed in mammary gland  , indicating that our test does not always find ase in highly expressed genes.

monoallelic expression  in at least one tissue was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> genes tested  and for  <dig> of  <dig> genes tested with more than one heterozygous snp with ase . we have categorised ase as mae where the major allele is at a frequency >90 %. this category of genes is the most affected by errors in the cow’s genome sequence  and so we consider the 28 % of genes with mae for more than one snp to be most likely to be mae , but that the true estimate is somewhere between 28–54 %. within tissue estimates of genes that are mae in this study range from  <dig> – <dig>  % in thymus and thyroid and 24–38 % in lung with an average of 7–12 % across all tissues. the correlation of mae between tissues  shows some correlation between their mae patterns but largely these expression patterns are more different between tissues than ase . our conservative estimate of 28 % of genes showing mae across tissues is higher than reported by keane et al.  <cit>  in  <dig> mouse tissues who found that 12 % of genes showed significant extreme  allelic bias and pinter et al.  <cit>  who found that 5 % of genes tested showed monoallelic expression  in  <dig> mouse tissues. however in this study we have tested many more tissues than either of those studies. our estimates of 7–12 % within single tissues agree with published reports - gimelbrant et al.  <cit>  reported that 5–10 % of  <dig> tested autosomal genes displayed random monoallelic expression in human clonal cell lines, and zwemer et al.  <cit>  report that 10 % of  <dig> autosomal genes tested showed random monoalleleic expression in mouse cell lines. our estimates of 7–12 % within single tissues agree with these published reports.table  <dig> monoallelic expression results, the number and proportion of snp tested that were showing monoallelic expression , that is the major allele is at a frequency >90 %, in each tissue and in total. also the number and proportion of genes tested that contained mae snp . then the number and proportion of genes with greater than one snp showing mae  in each tissue and in total



validation of allele specific and mono allelic expression
in an attempt to confirm some of the above findings we tested ase in a validation dataset. this data consisted of rna sequence reads from  <dig> first lactation holstein dairy cows for two tissues, liver and white blood cells . the data was mapped and tested for ase in a similar manor to the original dataset above . however these animals did not have whole genome sequence data and so greater than  <dig> million snp were imputed for these animals and phased genotypes used to create parental genomes and then tested for ase in the rna sequence reads. on average  <dig> million reads were generated per library with  <dig>  % passing quality control, and 89 % of those mapped uniquely to both the maternal and paternal genomes .

on average, across the  <dig> samples, 13–29 % of the  <dig> genes tested in white blood cells and 12–26 % of the  <dig> genes tested in liver showed significant ase . however across all samples 35–72 % of  <dig> genes tested in white blood cells and 31–65 % of  <dig> genes tested in liver showed significant ase . that means that  <dig> and 65 % of all genes tested across all samples showed significant ase in white blood cells and liver respectively, in at least one animal. the within sample estimates in white blood cells agreed very well with the 21–33 % of genes that showed ase in the discovery dataset . within sample estimates in liver were dramatically lower than that of the 59–73 % of genes that showed ase in the discovery dataset . however on average samples in the validation dataset had only  <dig> million paired reads mapped and tested only  <dig> genes, compared with the discovery dataset that had  <dig> million paired reads mapped and tested  <dig> genes for liver, therefore this reduction in the proportion of genes showing ase is likely a reflection of the reduced sequence coverage and therefore power to detect ase in individuals within the validation dataset.

on average, across all  <dig> samples,  <dig> – <dig>  % of  <dig> genes and  <dig> –4 % of  <dig> genes tested for white blood cells and liver respectively showed significant mae . however across all samples  <dig> –22 % of  <dig> genes and  <dig> –20 % of  <dig> genes tested in white blood cells and liver respectively showed significant mae respectively . these within sample estimates were much lower than the  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  % of genes tested in white blood cells and liver respectively of the discovery dataset. however again we attribute this to the sequence coverage and therefore the lower power to detect ase  in the individual validation samples.

interestingly when we combined samples within the validation dataset the proportion of genes that showed ase increased to 35– <dig> and 31–65 % in white blood cells and liver respectively . also the proportion of genes that show mae increased to  <dig> – <dig> and  <dig> –20 % in white blood cells and liver respectively . this reflects the variation in the genes that show ase across the  <dig> animals  and the moderate correlation between individuals  of genes showing ase . from additional file 1: figure s <dig> we can see that there are only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that showed ase  in five or more of the  <dig> animals in wbc, and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in liver. these drop to  <dig> and  <dig> for wbc and liver respectively in ten or more of the samples. for the validation dataset only, the correlation of genes showing ase is higher within tissues , however the correlations are still only moderate, reflecting the variability in genes that display ase across multiple individuals. additional file 1: figure s <dig> also shows that when the same tissue samples from the discovery dataset are included, the two tissues from the discovery dataset are more correlated with each other than they are with the other samples from the same tissues. we hypothesis that this difference is a reflection of the number of genes able to be used in the correlation calculation, therefore the power of the test is greater for that comparison. this relationship was also reported by the gtex consortium  <cit> . they compared between-sample, and between-tissue, sharing of ase with overall similarity of gene expression. they found that gene expression levels were similar between individuals when comparing within tissue, and different between tissues when comparing within individual gene expression, as you would expect. however allelic ratios had a higher correlation among tissues from the same individuals than among different individuals for the same tissue, suggesting that ase is primarily determined by the individual’s genome. therefore by testing only one individual we have likely underestimated the total number of genes displaying ase in the cattle population, and further testing in more individuals will uncover more genes that show ase.

preferential expression of the paternal allele
using the snp with known parental origin, we were able to classify genes as expressing either the paternal or maternal allele. our results found that on average  <dig>  % of all genes within a tissue, with significant ase snp and where parental origin could be determined, favoured expression of the paternal allele . the proportion of genes expressing the reference allele was on average  <dig>  %, a difference of  <dig>  %. using a t-test we found there was significantly  more paternal expression than reference allele expression . the distribution of all genes where parental origin could be determined  is depicted in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  it shows that on average across all tissues  <dig>  % of all genes tested express both alleles equally,  <dig>  % express the maternal allele preferentially and  <dig>  % express the paternal allele preferentially. this can also be seen in the heat map of allele expression , where the majority of tissues are dominated by paternal allele expression . the tissues are also clustered on the x axis by the alleles that are expressed, so that the tissues on the left have more maternal expression  but, as we move across the tissues to the right, the amount of maternal expression decreased. however when snp with paternal allele frequency of zero or one were removed,  <dig>  % of all genes favoured expression of the paternal allele. this indicates that it is the genes that show mae that are favouring the paternal allele. the correlation of this paternal expression between tissues is shown in fig. 5c, which demonstrated correlation between tissue’s paternal ase patterns, but largely these expression patterns are more different between tissues than ase . crowley et al.  <cit>  reported that 54–60 % of all genes, with significant ase, favoured expression of the paternal allele in mouse brain. this is consistent with our estimates of 53–57 % in brain caudal lobe and in brain cerebellum respectively . because we were only able to determine phase in ~50 % of the snp tested we have not been able to test as many genes as was tested by crowley et al.  <cit> . we have however tested many more tissues and found the same allele expression pattern favouring the paternal allele in many tissues .table  <dig> the total number of genes showing significant ase, where phase could be determined, and the number and proportion of those where the major allele is the paternal allele and the reference allele

note phase could not be determined for all snp tested. also p-value from the wald-wolfowitz  runs test in each tissue, where * denotes those that are significant



there is now accumulating evidence that expression within cells is from one chromosome . borel et al.  <cit>  tested ase in  <dig> single cells. they found that for most actively transcribed genes one allele was predominantly expressed in each of the single cells, and that equal numbers of single cells expressed one or the other allele, with very few  expressing both alleles. pinter et al.  <cit>  performed rna-dna fish and rnaseq on mouse tail fibroblast cells. rna-dna fish showed that the majority of single cells expressed only a single allele. also, for genes that showed ase in the rnaseq data, there was an imbalance in the number of cells expressing the major allele. so if this is the case in all mammals then what we see in this study is that within certain tissues there are more cells within a tissue complex expressing the paternal allele at any one time for genes that show mae.

coordinated expression of neighbouring genes
to investigate whether there was evidence for co-expression of genes in close proximity to each other, we performed a wald-wolfowitz runs test on an ordered list of genes classified by paternal or maternal expression in each tissue . our results show that nine of the  <dig> tissues displayed significant  clustering of expression, greater than expected by chance. this means that neighbouring genes were more likely to express the allele from the same chromosome . figure 5d shows the correlation between tissues of clusters with greater than five genes expressing the same allele and additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the frequency of runs of 2– <dig> genes showing the same parental inheritance. for brain caudal lobe, one chromosome region showing expression from the same chromosome included  <dig> snp across the five known genes, gimap <dig>  gimap <dig> copy <dig>  gimap <dig>  gimap <dig> copy  <dig> and gimap <dig> that all detect strong ase of the paternal allele . these five known genes are from one gene family known as gimap family  and they have no known common control region. the function for these genes in brain is not known but previous studies have found these genes predominantly expressed in mature lymphocytes, and suggest they have a role in lymphocyte survival  <cit> . crowley et al.  <cit>  also found that genes with higher expression from one parental allele tended to cluster in mouse. they found that, among the  <dig> autosomes,  <dig> had a higher proportion of genes whose neighbour had the same parental skew in expression which was more than expected by chance.

allele specific expression in known imprinted genes
one source of ase is imprinting, so we investigated whether genes previously found to be imprinted in mammals , extracted from the gene imprint database , showed extreme ase in our data set. thirty one of these genes, four of which had been previously reported to be imprinted in cattle , could be tested for imprinting in our data because there was both expression of the gene  and a heterozygous snp in the transcripts from that gene. genes were classified as either not imprinted, imprinted, partially imprinted, tissue specifically imprinted or tissue specific partially imprinted . there was evidence for ase in  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> tested, including all four previously reported as imprinted in cattle . twelve of the  <dig> genes showed ase in specific tissues, varying from one of the tissues showing expression , to all but one of the tissues showing expression  . six of the  <dig> genes had the same allele expressed as was previously reported, including all  <dig> genes previously reported as imprinted in cattle . seven had the opposite allele expressed but none of these genes had previously been reported as imprinted in cattle . for example adenosine monophosphate deaminase  <dig>  was reported as expressing the maternal allele in mice, however our data suggests tissue dependant ase. here we found the paternal allele expressed in thyroid and blood, and the maternal allele expressed in lung. bos taurus growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig>  imprinting was reported as isoform dependant in human and mouse, here in cattle we found partial imprinting of just the paternal allele in all  <dig> tissues.table  <dig> summary of classification of genes previously found to be imprinted in human and mice or cattle

the number of genes classified as either not imprinted, imprinted, partially imprinted, tissue specifically imprinted or tissue specific partially imprinted. ase defines whether the class of genes showed significant ase, maf >90 % defines if the major allele frequency was greater than 90 % and all tissues defines if the ase result was observed across all tissue the gene was expressed in

because we could distinguish maternal and paternal alleles only in one animal, we were unable to distinguish imprinting from cis eqtl in this study. however, it seems likely that the ase we observed in the four genes previously reported to be imprinted in cattle  is due to imprinting. the results for other genes could be due to cis eqtl or they may indicate that imprinting is a more variable phenomenon than classically described and varies in extent and tissue specificity.

implications for cattle breeding
our attention must now turn to the identification of these cis-regulatory variants, and the international faang  consortium  <cit>  aims to do this for livestock species. the identification of causative regulatory variants could then be used in livestock genomic selection programs leading to more accurate genomic breeding values and increases in the rate of genetic gain for economically important traits in cattle and other livestock species. a promising example where this has been tried has been in chicken’s response to mareks disease infection,  <cit> . the authors discovered snp that showed ase in response to infection and found they accounted for ~83 % of the genetic variance for mareks disease resistance  <cit> . they then used those snp to genotype a resource population of  <dig> chickens to generate snp effects for mareks disease resistance, and used those in the genomic prediction of  <dig> roosters. these roosters were progeny tested for mareks disease resistance. the genomic predictions based on the ase snp had 61 % higher accuracy than traditional breeding values  <cit> . so although the snp used were unlikely to be causative they would have been in high ld with the causative regulatory variants, resulting in them being highly predictive of mareks disease resistance. this approach could be used in cattle for important diseases such as tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis. the identification of causative regulatory variants is expected to further increase the accuracy of genomic predictions for production and health traits.

CONCLUSIONS
investigating the extent of ase across  <dig> bovine tissues in one cow and two tissues in  <dig> cows demonstrates 1) ase is pervasive in cattle, 2) the ase is often mae but ranges from mae to slight overexpression of the major allele, 3) the ase is most often tissue specific and that more than half the time displays divergent allele specific expression patterns across tissues 4) the expression slightly favours the paternal allele and 5) genes expressing the same parental allele are clustered together more than expected by chance, and there are several runs of large numbers of genes expressing the same parental allele.
