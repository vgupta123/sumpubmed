BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle contains quiescent mononucleated myogenic cells, called satellite cells, that are able to proliferate in response to injury and give rise to new functional myofibers. soon after a lesion, inflammatory cells such as neutrophiles and macrophages are recruited at the damaged site where they release growth factors and cytokines that induce satellite cells to proliferate. the activated satellite cells divide asymmetrically to  reconstitute the stock of stem cells and  provide myoblasts that will first proliferate and then undergo myogenic differentiation and maturation to form new muscle fibers. the new cells can fuse between themselves or with existing fibers. muscle differentiation involves a cascade of muscle-specific gene activation coordinated with irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle. the commitment of cells to the muscle lineage and to progression through differentiation requires the activation of a limited set of muscle-specific transcription factors. these key factors are the basic helix-loop-helix  transcription factors myod, myf <dig>  myogenin  and mrf <dig>  which are collectively called myogenic regulatory factors . the mrfs activate their target genes by binding to the e-box canntg consensus sequence  <cit> . primary cultures of newborn or adult skeletal muscles or established muscle cell lines like c2c <dig> can be used to study myogenic differentiation. these cells can be maintained as dividing cells in serum rich medium , but under the condition of mitogen deprivation, they exit the cell cycle in g <dig> to g <dig>  express the repertoire of muscle-specific genes and fuse to form syncytial myotubes  <cit> . myod is expressed early after satellite cell activation. in dividing cells, its function is repressed, but upon induction of differentiation, its transcriptional activity is induced, and it governs two distinct essential functions:  activation of muscle specific genes, such as myog, and  induction of withdrawal from the cell cycle by activation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21cip1/waf <dig> and rb  <cit> .

necdin, a member of the large family of mage proteins, has recently been reported to promote myoblast survival and differentiation and to improve skeletal muscle regeneration  <cit> . necdin has also been shown to protect muscle fibers from tumor-induced wasting by interfering with the tnf signaling cascade  <cit> . maged <dig>  is an x-linked mage family member that physically interacts with necdin  <cit> . although in vitro studies have suggested a role for maged <dig> in diverse biological functions, only its role in the apoptotic signaling cascade emanating for the tnf receptor superfamily member p75ntr  has been confirmed in vivo so far  <cit> . interestingly, data obtained by high throughput expression analysis indicate that the expression of maged <dig> rna is upregulated in the muscles of duchenne muscular dystrophy  patients, a condition in which muscle regeneration concomitantly occurs with the degeneration of myofibers  <cit> . this observation and the fact that maged <dig> physically interacts with necdin encouraged us to investigate the possible roles of maged <dig> in muscle regeneration and differentiation. here, we show that maged <dig> is transcriptionally upregulated during myogenic differentiation and that maged <dig> deficiency results in deficient myoblast differentiation and maturation, leading to delayed muscle regeneration in vivo.

RESULTS
maged <dig> is induced early during myogenic differentiation
microarray gene profiling indicated that maged <dig> was upregulated in skeletal biopsies from dmd patients when compared to unaffected controls  <cit> . to determine if maged <dig> was expressed in proliferating and/or differentiating muscle cells, we first analyzed maged <dig> rna and protein levels in myoblasts from the c2c <dig> cell line. differentiation of the myoblasts was induced by serum starvation and monitored by following expression of p21cip1/waf <dig> and myog during a four-day period. we observed that maged <dig> was expressed in proliferating c2c <dig> cells and that maged <dig> rna and protein levels increased, respectively, up to three and two folds after induction of differentiation. the levels of maged <dig> reached a plateau  <dig> hours after serum starvation, at the time when the cells withdraw from the cell cycle, and these elevated levels were maintained until the end of the experiment, four days after serum starvation . we next analyzed expression of maged <dig> in primary myoblast cultures derived from mouse tibialis anterior  muscle and found maged <dig> protein expressed in the proliferating cells. a two-fold induction of maged <dig> expression was also observed in these cells following differentiation by serum starvation . to determine if maged <dig> is induced in vivo in regenerating muscle, we followed its expression during the course of muscle healing after injection of cardiotoxin  in ta muscles. western blot analysis detected no or very little maged <dig> expression in intact mouse muscle, but the protein was strongly induced as soon as  <dig> hours after ctx injection . this maged <dig> upregulation could emerge from muscle cells  or from non-muscle cells . to determine the contribution of muscle cells to the observed induction, we followed maged <dig> expression after ctx injection in ta muscle of mice with a cre-mediated deletion of maged <dig> driven by the promoter of the human alpha-skeletal actin  gene, which is activated specifically in differentiating muscle cells  <cit> . these maged1tm1urfm/hsa-cre mice were obtained by crossing mice with a conditional  allele of maged <dig>  with transgenic mice carrying an hsa-cre transgene 79jme/j). in the resulting mice, cre is switched on and maged <dig> is deleted specifically in differentiating muscle myotubes  <cit> . the weaker induction of maged <dig> in these mice demonstrated that differentiating and/or mature muscle cells contribute to the maged <dig> induction after ctx injury . the remaining maged <dig> expression most probably originates from muscle cells that do not express cre  and/or from non-muscle cells. together, our results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo induction of maged <dig> in the course of myoblast differentiation.

maged <dig> transcription is activated by mrfs during myoblast differentiation
the myogenic differentiation program is regulated primarily by the mrfs that all bind to e-box motifs in their target gene promoters. these factors act in cooperation with myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>  and bhlh e proteins to drive the myogenic differentiation program. in c2c <dig> myoblasts, myod is expressed but is inactive when cells are cultured in serum-rich medium  <cit> . upon serum starvation, myod is activated and triggers the myogenic differentiation program by transactivating its target genes, including myog. the early upregulation of maged <dig> rna after serum starvation suggested that maged <dig> transcription could be regulated by myod. we analyzed the promoter region of the human maged <dig> gene  in silico and compared it with the orthologous regions of distant species of mammals: m. musculus, s. scrofa and c. familiaris. we found that the maged <dig> promoter of all of these species contains four conserved e-boxes located in two conserved regions, suggesting that these sites could be important for the control of maged <dig> transcription .

to test this hypothesis, the dna fragment from - <dig> to + <dig> of the human maged <dig> promoter was inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and tested for cis-activation in proliferating and differentiating c2c <dig> myoblasts. we found that the luciferase activity controlled by this fragment increased approximately ten fold  <dig> hours after the induction of differentiation by serum starvation. to localize the key regulatory elements in this fragment, we deleted segments from its 5' end and found that the -531+ <dig> fragment had nearly the same activity as the -1977+ <dig> fragment . this indicates that the two proximal e-boxes at - <dig> and - <dig>  are possible important sites for transcriptional induction. we tested the importance of these two e-boxes by targeted mutagenesis. mutation of the - <dig> e-box resulted in a significant reduction of induction after serum starvation, indicating that this site is important for induction and that mrfs are probably directly involved . we then tested the potential of transfected myod to transactivate the -531+ <dig> fragment in nih-3t <dig> cells, which do not express endogenous myod. myod induced a three-fold increase in the expression of the luciferase reporter . altogether, these results show that the maged <dig> promoter is activated upon the induction of myoblast differentiation and contains conserved e-boxes that are important for its transactivation by myod.

deficiency of maged <dig> results in impaired myogenic differentiation
the induction of maged <dig> during myoblast differentiation and the fact that the related protein necdin promotes myoblast differentiation suggested that maged <dig> could also be a regulator of myogenic differentiation. to investigate this possibility, we compared differentiation of primary myoblasts isolated from wild-type or from constitutive maged <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . we observed that wild-type myoblasts differentiated and matured to form myotubes  <dig> hours after serum starvation. in contrast, very few and very thin myotubes were formed by maged1-deficient myoblasts at this time point . we quantified this deficiency to form myotubes by calculating the fusion index   <dig> hours and  <dig> hours after serum starvation. as shown in figure 3b, we observed a dramatic reduction of the fusion index at these two time points, confirming that maged <dig> is essential for the fusion of myoblasts in these conditions . using qrt-pcr, we also followed the expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain  and muscle creatine kinase , two late markers of myoblast differentiation. we observed that the impaired morphological differentiation of the maged1-deficient myoblasts was accompanied by a largely reduced induction of these two markers . we then analyzed the regeneration capacity of injured muscle in mice with the hsa-cre mediated deletion of maged <dig> . although no overt morphological abnormality was observed in the untreated maged1-deficient muscles, we observed that muscle regeneration was significantly delayed: five days after ctx injection in the ta muscle, fewer and smaller new myofibers had been formed and the laminin scaffold was much more disorganized when compared to controls . we quantified this defect by measuring the cross-sectional area of the new muscle fibers and found that it was reduced by 47% in maged1tm1urfm/hsa-cre mice compared to controls . two days later , the difference between wild-type and maged1tm1urfm/hsa-cre had become smaller . altogether, these observations demonstrate that maged <dig> is essential for myoblast differentiation in vitro and that maged <dig> deficiency delays muscle regeneration in vivo.

maged <dig> is required for normal p21cip1/waf <dig> expression and cell cycle withdrawal of differentiating myoblasts
reduced differentiation could result from deficient expression of mrfs or from an inability to withdraw from the cell cycle in g <dig>  to identify the cause of the differentiation defect observed in the myoblasts derived from constitutive maged <dig> knockout mice, we analyzed the expression of p21cip1/waf <dig>  myod, myog and mef2c by qrt-pcr. we did not detect significant differences in the levels of myod, myog and mef2c between knockouts and controls . however, we observed a reduced level of p21cip1/waf <dig> mrna in both proliferating and differentiating maged <dig> knockout myoblasts . p21cip1/waf <dig> facilitates cell cycle withdrawal and enhances the survival of differentiating myoblasts  <cit> . we hypothesized that the reduced level of p21cip1/waf <dig> in maged1-deficient myoblasts could impair cell cycle withdrawal. to test this possibility, we compared the cell cycle distribution of wild-type and maged1-deficient myoblasts upon induction of the differentiating. facs analysis showed no difference in cell cycle profiles in serum rich medium. however,  <dig> hours after serum starvation, the fraction of cells in s phase was three times greater in the maged1-deficient cell population when compared to the wild-type control cells . brdu incorporation confirmed that maged1-deficient myoblasts do not exit the cell cycle efficiently upon serum starvation: twice as many maged <dig> deficient cells incorporated brdu compared to wild-type cells . we concluded that maged <dig> knockout myoblasts cannot exit the cell cycle efficiently after the induction of differentiation.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
skeletal muscle satellite cells are quiescent stem cells that are activated in response to physiological or pathological stimuli such as after muscle injury or in chronic pathological conditions. after an acute lesion, the initial phase of muscle repair is characterized by inflammation and degeneration of the damaged tissue. almost simultaneously, satellite cells are activated and proliferate to generate a population of myoblasts that differentiate and fuse to form new multinucleated myotubes. muscle regeneration is a tightly orchestrated process, and understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for its control is important for the development of treatments of muscles impaired by aging, disease or atrophy.

maged <dig> is upregulated during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration
maged <dig> is silent in normal adult muscles, but it is massively induced soon after injury of skeletal muscles. in primary cultures of myoblasts, maged <dig> is expressed in proliferating cells, and its expression increases within the first  <dig> hours after the induction of terminal differentiation at the time when cells normally exit from the cell cycle. we observed that high levels of maged <dig> rna and protein were maintained as long as the differentiation proceeded. promoter analysis showed that maged <dig> transcription was upregulated during myogenic differentiation and that two e-boxes present in the proximal promoter were responsible for this activation. this strongly suggests that myod and/or other mrfs is  responsible for this regulation.

maged <dig> is required for efficient myoblast cell cycle withdrawal, myogenic differentiation and normal muscle regeneration after injury
the induction of maged <dig> during muscle differentiation and regeneration suggested that it could play a role during these processes. we showed that mouse primary myoblasts deficient in maged <dig> had a largely reduced capacity to differentiate and to fuse. in vivo, the loss of maged <dig> leads to delayed regeneration after muscle injury with the production of smaller muscle fibers. this deficit appears to result from a late block in the differentiation program. indeed, in the absence of maged <dig>  we observed normal expression of myod and myog, which are early differentiation markers expressed in proliferating cells, whereas the late markers emhc  and mck  were not induced properly. the mechanism responsible for this deficit remains to be fully elucidated, but the reduced ability of the cells to establish the g <dig> arrest probably contributes to the impaired differentiation. a similar observation was made in p <dig> embryonic carcinoma cells differentiating in neurons after treatment with retinoic acid: downregulation of maged <dig> by morpholinos disturbed neurogenesis by impairing cell cycle withdrawal  <cit> . maged <dig> thus appears to be a key component regulating the transition of progenitors to differentiated neurons and muscle cells by interfering with the cell cycle progression.

a future direction of inquiry following these results will be to determine how maged <dig> regulates the g <dig> to g <dig> transition in differentiating myoblasts. this cell cycle arrest requires the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor  protein  <cit> . the precise mechanisms leading to the activation of rb during myogenesis remain unclear. rb activity is controlled by its phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases , which are in turn controlled by cdk inhibitors, including p21cip1/waf <dig>  <cit> . in differentiating myoblasts, p21cip1/waf <dig> transcription is directly controlled by members of the p <dig> family  <cit> . indeed, ectopic expression of Δnp <dig>  a transdominant inhibitor of all p <dig> members  prevents p21cip1/waf <dig> induction, cell cycle withdrawal and myogenic differentiation  <cit> . the fact that p <dig> knockout mice exhibit normal muscle development excludes an essential role for this protein in myogenic differentiation and points at p <dig> and/or p <dig> as the key factors in this process  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown that overexpression of maged <dig> in hek <dig> cells activates p53-dependent transactivation of the p21cip1/waf <dig> promoter  <cit> . as p21cip1/waf <dig> expression is reduced in maged1-deficient myoblasts, we can hypothesize that maged <dig> acts as a transcriptional cofactor of p <dig> and/or p <dig> to promote p21cip1/waf <dig> expression and cell cycle exit. alternatively, maged <dig> could act indirectly, by sequestering an inhibitor of p <dig> and/or p <dig> activity. such a mechanism has been shown for necdin, which sequesters eid- <dig>  an e1a-like protein that inhibits myod by suppressing the acetyltransferase activity of its transcriptional co-activator p <dig>  <cit> .

it has been shown previously that maged <dig> can regulate transcription by interacting with several transcription factors and regulators  <cit> . besides its involvement in the regulation of cell proliferation through p21cip1/waf <dig> expression, maged <dig> could directly or indirectly regulate other genes essential for the skeletal myogenic differentiation. a role for maged <dig> in cell adhesion has been reported by xue et al.  <cit> , we could therefore imagine that deficient cell adhesion and/or fusion could also participate in the observed muscle phenotype.

maged <dig> is broadly expressed in embryonic and adult tissues and has been identified as interacting with many proteins implicated in apoptosis signaling, cell cycle regulation, cell adhesion and migration, cell differentiation and transcription regulation  <cit> . however, the physiological relevance of these interactions remains largely to be demonstrated. we have produced maged <dig> knockout mice and have shown previously that maged <dig> acts as a pro-apoptotic factor required for normal developmental apoptosis of sympathetic, sensory and motor neurons in vivo  <cit> . here, we show that maged <dig> plays an important role in myogenic differentiation by allowing myoblasts to express appropriate levels of p21cip1/waf <dig>  exit the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation.
