BACKGROUND
cytokines are low molecular weight proteins that exert pleiotropic effects on cells involved in the immune and acute phase responses. because cytokines are crucially involved in many biological processes such as hematopoiesis, immunity, tumour genesis, haemostasis, vascularization and repair of connective tissues, deregulation of cytokines is implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of human diseases and may be used to refine diagnosis, measure the progress of diseases, or predict and monitor the effects of treatment  <cit> . cytokine measurements using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , the current standard procedure for protein quantification  <cit> , is often limited by the requirement of high sample volume , narrow dynamic range and low throughput due to the analysis of a single analyte per sample  <cit> . compared with elisa, protein microarray technology on fluorescence-enhancing plasmonic gold films recently described by tabakman et al.  <cit>  provides improved sensitivity and a broader dynamic range while allowing for high-throughput analysis of multiple determinants within a single sample .

we wanted to optimise this platform to work on cytokines that are lowly expressed. we further wanted to apply the technology on biological fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis  where samples are often scarce in volume and may be compromised by the presence of heterophilic antibodies. we chose il- <dig> as a model cytokine due its widely described role in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis and ra  <cit> . il- <dig> is up-regulated in psoriatic skin  <cit> , whereas in ra patients, it is expressed in synovial fibroblasts, mononuclear cells and neutrophil granulocytes of the synovial membrane  <cit> . no evidence supports a role for il- <dig> in the systemic immune response, suggesting that il- <dig> acts at local sites of inflammation in ra patients. finally, il- <dig> is involved in tumour growth and metastasis and represents a promising target in the treatment of breast, bladder and lung cancers .

il- <dig> protein levels in human biological fluids reportedly range from 60 pg/ml to 1650 ng/ml  <cit> . for elisa measurements, multiple sample dilutions are required to cover this range, making reliable measurements of serum/plasma and synovial fluid  il- <dig> challenging. heterophilic antibodies, including rheumatoid factor , further compromise data reliability, as rf causes falsely increased or false positive results when the cytokine is detected using traditional immunoassays, e.g. elisa, or bead based assays  <cit> . rf mainly interferes with the measurement of cytokines by cross-linking capture and detection antibodies  <cit> . rf has a prevalence of up to 80 % in ra patients and 15 % in healthy individuals  <cit> , thus there is a tremendous need for novel sensitive assays that can assess and eliminate potential rf interference while having a broad detection range.

here, we show that by exploiting the near-infrared physical fluorescence enhancement provided by a gold film, plasmonic protein microarrays can detect cytokines at sensitivities <1 pg/ml while covering a 5-log dynamic range. on the same chip, rf interference was assessed and false positive results caused by rf were eliminated. the sample volume required was low , providing major advantages when limited amounts of biological materials are available.

RESULTS
detection of il- <dig> protein levels using plasmonic gold substrates
highly similar standard curves were obtained from recombinant human -il- <dig> expressed in e.coli  or hek- <dig>  , suggesting that post-translational modifications do not interfere with detection of il- <dig>  thus, il- <dig> levels were determined based on e.coli-expressed rh-il- <dig> . levels of il- <dig> in the subject samples ranged from 11–650 pg/ml.fig  <dig> il- <dig> quantification using plasmonic gold substrates. a) il- <dig> standard curves obtained using rh-il- <dig> expressed in e.coli , or r&d systems ()) or in hek- <dig> ). rh-il- <dig> was diluted in 5 % bsa in pbs. median ± sd fluorescence intensities are shown. lower limit of quantification  is indicated by the vertical dotted line. b) fluorescence intensities for il- <dig> and isotype control capture antibodies before and after pre-incubation with a mix of animal iggs. serum  and synovial fluid  mean il- <dig> levels ± sd for two donors are shown. representative maps  shown for one donor



detection of il- <dig> showed linearity over a 5-log dynamic range covering 2– <dig>  pg/ml  , allowing for accurate cytokine quantification without the need for multiple dilutions. limit of detection  was  <dig>  pg/ml. lower limit of quantification  was 2 pg/ml, while the accuracy of the back-calculated calibrator concentration was 91 %  and precision  was <20 %. similar sensitivities and dynamic ranges were obtained for other cytokines; il- <dig>  tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig> . spike-in recovery measurements were performed in serum samples from three healthy controls  and were 93 % , which is within the technical specification range of 70-130 %  <cit> .

elimination of rf interference
spike-in recovery of cytokines in serum samples from ra patients were affected by the presence of rf , highlighting the need for an estimate of rf interference and a protocol for eliminating the erroneous signal amplification. regardless of whether anti-il- <dig> or isotype control was used as capture antibody, the fluorescence signals were similar for two ra serum samples , indicating that rf interfered with il- <dig> detection resulting in false positive signals. pre-treatment of samples with a mix of animal iggs that were previously heat aggregated, eliminated the rf interference .

il- <dig> levels in sf were significantly higher  in ra patients  than in patients with osteoarthritis   . however, il- <dig> levels in serum were comparable for ra , oa , or hc  . pairwise comparison showed that the serum levels of il- <dig> were higher than the corresponding sf levels in oa patients , while this was not the case in ra patients .fig  <dig> il- <dig> levels in synovial fluid and serum samples. a) il- <dig> levels are higher in synovial fluid samples from patients with ra compared with oa . each dot represents the average concentration for  <dig> patient based on  <dig> independent experiments, median and interquartile range is shown. b) il- <dig> levels in serum samples from ra, oa and hc. data are represented as in . c) il- <dig> levels in matched serum and synovial fluid samples from oa and ra patients. data are represented as in . il- <dig> serum levels in oa patients were higher than matched sf levels 



discussion
rf interference in immuno-assays is a significant source of uncertainty in medical testing and may cause misleading interpretation of the results for ra patients  <cit> . so far, detection of rf interference has required measurement of the same sample before and after addition of a blocking agent  <cit>  or following sample pre-treatment in non-immune serum  <cit> . however these tests require a large sample volume   <cit> , and may be inconclusive or require re-collection of sample material. this study provides a novel protein microarray platform based on plasmonic gold films that reliably detects cytokines and assess for rf interference in 5 μl sample volume.

this study focused on il- <dig> due to its pro-inflammatory role in autoimmune diseases and because this cytokine requires a high-sensitivity assay for detection in sf where limited sample material is available. however, the technology can be applied to other cytokines provided that good capture and detection antibody pairs can be obtained. we have further optimised the assay for il- <dig>  tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig> 

il- <dig> levels in sf have been measured using elisa  <cit> . however data reliability needs to be confirmed by negating an effect of rf  <cit> , as traditional immuno-assays produce high background noise if rf is present  <cit> . by analysing serum and sf samples in arrays spotted both with anti-il- <dig> antibody and isotype control antibody, we could assess for false positive measurements and show the successful elimination of rf interference. the use of plasmonic gold substrates provided fluorescence enhancement, lowering the lod to  <dig>  pg/ml, a level ~ <dig> times lower than a traditional elisa kit . plasmonic gold chips also supported a wider dynamic range covering linear il- <dig> detection over a 5-log dynamic range  and inter and intra-runs cv of <20 %.

similarly to data by hsu et al.  <cit> , we showed that il- <dig> levels were significantly higher in sf samples from patients with ra compared to oa . our findings were in contrast with those of scrivo et al.  <cit> , who reported increased il- <dig> levels in serum of ra compared to oa and hc. of note, the subjects included in the latter study are not comparable to ours in terms of number and clinical features. moreover, rf interference was not assessed in the paper by scrivo et al. the il- <dig> increase in sf of ra patients rather than in the circulation supported a role for il- <dig> at the site of inflammation rather than in the systemic immune response.

although traditional elisa remains the method of choice for cytokine detection in clinical laboratories, the presence of rf will lead to analytical errors with serious implications for patient care  <cit> . we show that artefacts caused by rf assay interference can be eliminated by a simple sample pre-treatment using heat-aggregated animal igg. rf elimination can be done without affecting assay sensitivity or cytokine detection. this platform was validated using serum and sf samples from patients with ra, oa and hc. our protein microarrays on plasmonic gold substrates can be deployed to assess and eliminate rf interference to finally obtain reliable cytokine data for use in the clinic and in research to increase quality of patient care.

CONCLUSIONS
this study showed that plasmonic protein microarrays on gold film substrate allowed for sensitive and reliable cytokine quantification in biological fluids in 5 μl sample volume. on the same chip, rheumatoid factor interference can be assessed and eliminated without requirement of extra sample material or additional immunoassays. hence, this technology can be applied to reliably detect lowly expressed cytokines in different biological sources even if limited amounts of biological materials are available.
