BACKGROUND
cytochrome p450s constitute the largest gene superfamily and are found in the organs and tissues of many organisms, including mammals, fish, plants, arthropods, fungi, and bacteria. cytochrome p450s have long been of particular interest because they are critical for the detoxification and/or activation of xenobiotics such as drugs, pesticides, plant toxins, chemical carcinogens and mutagens; and for metabolizing endogenous compounds such as hormones, fatty acids, and steroids. basal and up-regulation of p <dig> gene expression can significant affect disposition of xenobiotics or endogenous compounds in the tissues of organisms and thus alter their pharmacological/toxicological effects  <cit> . insect cytochrome p450s are known to play an important role in detoxifying insecticides  <cit>  and plant toxins  <cit> , resulting in the development of resistance to insecticides  <cit>  and facilitating the adaptation of insects to their plant hosts  <cit> . a significant characteristic of insect p450s that is associated with enhanced metabolic detoxification of insecticides in insects is the constitutively increased levels of p <dig> proteins and p <dig> activity that result from constitutively transcriptional overexpression of p <dig> genes in insecticide resistant insects  <cit> . another feature of insect p <dig> genes is that the expression of some p <dig> genes can be induced by exogenous and endogenous compounds  <cit> , a phenomenon known as induction. it has been suggested that the induction of p450s and their activities in insects is involved in the adaptation of insects to their environment and the development of insecticide resistance  <cit> .

while all insects probably possess some capacity to detoxify insecticides and xenobiotics, the degree to which they can metabolize and detoxify these toxic chemicals is of considerable importance to their survival in a chemically unfriendly environment  <cit>  and to the development of resistance. the constitutively increased expression and induction of p450s are thought to be responsible for increased levels of detoxification of insecticides, but unlike the constitutively overexpressed p <dig> genes, whose association with insecticide resistance has been extensively studied, the induction of p450s by xenobiotics, especially phenobarbital, is less well linked to insecticide resistance, although it is well documented in insects  <cit> . it has been proposed that many chemical inducers act as substrates for p450s and that the induction or modulation of p450s by the substrates will, in turn, reduce the effects of the substrates by enhancing substrate metabolism  <cit> . it has been suggested that the modulation of gene expression reflects a compromise between the insect's need to both conserve energy and adjust to a rapidly changing environment by enhancing the activity of the detoxification system only when a chemical stimulus occurs  <cit> .

the house fly strain alhf exhibits high levels of resistance to pyrethroids  <cit> . previous research using piperonyl butoxide , an inhibitor of cytochrome p450s, suggested that p450-mediated detoxification may be one of the major mechanisms involved in the development of pyrethroid resistance in alhf  <cit> . genetic linkage analysis points to the localization of pbo-suppressible-p450-mediated resistance on autosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of alhf  <cit>  and factors on autosome  <dig> are known to play a major role in p450-mediated resistance. two p <dig> cdnas, cyp6a <dig> and cyp6a5v <dig>  have recently been identified as being constitutively overexpressed in alhf and mapped on autosome  <dig>  <cit> , which is correlated with the linkage of resistance in alhf. these studies suggest the importance of constitutive overexpression of these two genes in increasing metabolic detoxification of permethrin and in the evolution of permethrin resistance in alhf. to test whether induction of p450s is also involved in the development of permethrin resistance in alhf, the current study is focused on the characterization of individual p <dig> genes from house flies that are induced in response to permethrin challenge in alhf. three novel p <dig> genes, cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig>  were isolated whose expression was induced by permethrin treatment in alhf. genetic linkage studies were then conducted in order to identify a further possible causal link between the expression of these genes in response to insecticide treatment and the development of insecticide resistance in alhf.

RESULTS
identification of p <dig> genes in response to permethrin challenge
in order to identify the p <dig> genes raised in response to the insecticide treatment, we used the pcr technique with degenerated pcr primers  <cit>  to amplify p <dig> cdnas from house flies. we initially isolated a total of  <dig> p <dig> cdna fragments from alhf house flies using three primer pairs, c2/flyh <dig>  c2/flyc <dig>  and hemer1/cyp6ad <dig> . northern blot analysis was conducted using the  <dig> p <dig> cdna fragments as probes to compare expression levels of these cdnas in both permethrin treated and untreated susceptible cs and resistant alhf house flies. three of the  <dig> p <dig> cdnas were found to be significantly induced in the permethrin treated alhf house flies after  <dig> hours treatment  at the pilot dose of ld <dig> that caused ~50% mortality of each house fly strain.

the full length of the three putative p <dig> cdnas were isolated using 5'and/or 3' race with the primers  designed based on the 5' and/or 3' end sequences of the putative p <dig> cdna fragments. the sequences of the 5' and/or 3' race amplified cdnas overlapped with their corresponding putative p <dig> cdna fragments. an entire cdna fragment for each of the putative p <dig> genes was subsequently amplified for both alhf and aabys house flies by pcr using the primer pair  synthesized based on the respective 5' and 3' end sequences of each gene. the sequences were named cyp4d4v <dig> , cyp4g <dig> , and cyp6a <dig>  by the p <dig> nomenclature committee . the cdna sequences of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> have open reading frames of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nucleotides encoding proteins of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> residues, respectively. comparison of the deduced protein sequences of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> between alhf and aabys revealed identical protein sequences, although several nucleotide polymorphisms were found in the coding regions of these three genes between the two strains .

response of p <dig> genes to permethrin challenge in resistant and susceptible house flies
based on this pilot experiment, we focused our study on cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> in order to further characterize their overexpression in response to permethrin challenge in resistant and susceptible house flies using the quantitative real-time pcr  method, as described below under materials and methods. to minimize the possibility that these p <dig> genes have nothing to do with resistance but arose solely because of a strain-strain difference, the study used alhf and two susceptible house fly strains, cs and aabys. to examine the effect of permethrin on induction of the three target p450s, we measured the expression of the genes in house flies challenged with permethrin at a corresponding dose range  for various durations. although no induction was detected in either the susceptible cs flies of the aabys for the dose range and time intervals tested , our results showed that permethrin induced all three p <dig> genes in alhf with varying levels in a time - and dose -dependent manner . based on these data, a dose of  <dig> Î¼g/fly and a time interval of  <dig> h were chosen for the further induction studies.

we detected no significant induction in the expression of the three p <dig> genes in susceptible cs and aabys house flies that had either been treated with acetone alone or with permethrin solution in acetone compared with untreated house flies . similarly, no significant induction was obtained in acetone treated alhf house flies compared with their untreated counterparts . however, these three genes were induced at a variety of levels in permethrin treated alhf house flies compared with untreated or acetone treated alhf flies; a marked induction of cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> mrna  were detected in permethrin treated alhf house flies , whereas a low level  of induction for cyp4g <dig> was detected in the permethrin treated alhf house flies . the significant induction of the three target p <dig> genes only in alhf house flies suggests their importance in response to permethrin treatment in the resistant alhf house flies. no significant differences were observed in the basal expression of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> between alhf and both or one of the susceptible cs and aabys strains without permethrin treatment . these results suggest that, unlike some p450s in which constitutive expression may play important role in insecticide resistance  <cit> , cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp6a <dig>  and/or cyp4g <dig>  may be uniquely featured in alhf in response to the insecticide exposure through induction of their expression, which, in turn, enhances their capacity to detoxify the insecticide and leads to enhanced insecticide resistance.

chromosomal linkage and allele determination of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a38
we previously demonstrated that permethrin resistance in alhf house flies was linked to autosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  with major factors on autosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . we also demonstrated that the p450-mediated resistance in alhf was predominantly linked to autosome  <dig>  <cit> . to determine whether there is a causal link between the p <dig> genes and insecticide resistance, we examined the genetic linkage of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> with  <dig> back-cross  house fly lines derived from crosses of alhf and a susceptible morphological marker strain, aabys, by allele specific single nucleotide polymorphism  determination. sequence comparisons of the three genes between alhf and aabys revealed several nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding regions of cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp4g <dig>  while no nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the coding region of cyp6a <dig>  we therefore cloned a ~ <dig> bp 5' flanking region of cyp6a <dig> in order to genetically map the cyp6a <dig> gene. comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the 5' flanking region of cyp6a <dig> uncovered several nucleotide polymorphisms between alhf and aabys , so the nucleotide polymorphisms, c to t, c to t, and g to t, in cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig>  respectively, in alhf relative to aabys , were used to determine the linkage of p <dig> genes relative to the recessive morphological markers in the aabys strain. the snp determination reactions were conducted for each of the genes using a specific primer  designed according to the sequences immediately upstream of the nucleotide polymorphism in order to distinguish the single nucleotide polymorphism for the p <dig> allele in each house fly strain or line. our results showed that the bc <dig> lines with the genotypes of ac/ac, +/ar, +/bwb, +/ye, +/sw , +/ac, ar/ar, +/bwb, +/ye, +/sw , +/ac, +/ar, bwb/bwb, +/ye, +/sw , and +/ac, +/ar, +/bwb, ye/ye, +/sw  were heterozygous for cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig>  where as the bc <dig> line with the genotype of +/ac, +/ar, +/bwb, +/ye, sw/sw  was homozygous for both the cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> alleles from aabys . these results strongly indicate that both cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> are located on autosome  <dig> in house flies. the bc <dig> lines of a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> were heterozygous for cyp4g <dig>  whereas the a <dig> line was homozygous for the cyp4g <dig> allele from aabys , indicating that cyp4g <dig> is located on autosome  <dig> in house flies.

discussion
the primary goal of this study was to investigate whether insecticide resistant insects may be uniquely resistant to insecticides due to their ability to mount an adequate cellular response when challenged with insecticides by up-regulating the production of p450s, which, in turn, may significantly diminish toxicological effects of the insecticides to these insects  <cit> . it also appears that the induction of gene expression may reflect a good compromise between energy saving  and adjustment to a rapidly changing environment  <cit> . multiple p <dig> genes that are induced in insects in response to host plant allelochemicals or secondary products have been extensively studied  <cit>  and are fairly well documented in terms of their function in the adaptation of insects in "animal-plant warfare"  <cit>  and in the co-evolution of insects and plants  <cit> . in contrast, p <dig> gene induction in response to insecticide resistance is less well understood. the current study, therefore, focused on characterization the p <dig> genes induced in response to a challenge with insecticides in resistant house flies. we restricted this response to permethrin treatment because it is the insecticide that the house flies are resistant to. we found that resistant house flies exposed to permethrin responded by up-regulating a set of p <dig> genes compared to the levels found in flies that had not been challenged with permethrin, whereas susceptible house flies showed no significant response. this finding indicates that exposure to permethrin induced a response in the expression of multiple p <dig> genes at different levels in a resistance-specific manner. similar results have also been reported in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , where the expression of cyp6g <dig> and cyp12d <dig> were induced in the ddt resistant strains post-exposure to ddt. our study strongly indicated a clear dose- and time-dependent manner of induction. the lack of induction of p <dig> gene expression as a result of permethrin treatment at lower doses  in alhf house flies found in this study is probably due to their rapid metabolism of permethrin at lower doses, which thus never reaches the threshold dose needed for induction  <cit> . the low or nonexistent levels of induction at higher  doses may indicate a dysfunction of the induction system in insects that have been highly poisoned. a lack of induction of p450s has also been reported in drosophila melanogaster when the insects were challenged with insecticides at concentrations that exceeded lc <dig>  <cit> .

it has been proposed that induction and/or constitutive overexpression of p450s is linked to the adaptation of insects to their environment  <cit> . further, in many cases increased levels of p <dig> gene expression have resulted in increased levels of both total p450s and the activities of those p450s, strongly suggesting this as a major cause of insecticide resistance  <cit> . we recently identified two p <dig> genes that were constitutively overexpressed in alhf house flies  <cit> . our current study identified a further three  <dig> genes that were co-up-regulated in response to permethrin exposure in alhf house flies. taken together, these findings suggest both constitutive overexpression and induction mechanisms participate in increasing p450-mediated metabolic detoxification of permethrin in resistant alhf house and imply the role of these genes in the evolution of insecticide resistance. it has been proposed that there could be similar regulatory mechanisms governing p <dig> constitutive overexpression and induction, and that both contribute to the development of insecticide resistance  <cit> . accordingly, we hypothesize that both induction and constitutive overexpress of p <dig> genes in the resistant alhf share an altered regulatory system, which differs from that in the susceptible strains and regulate p <dig> gene expression in resistant house flies. further study of the regulation of both constitutively overexpressed  <cit>  and permethrin induced p <dig> genes will allow us to test this hypothesis.

early studies in our laboratory on permethrin resistance in alhf house flies led to the identification of permethrin resistance that could be largely suppressed by pbo, an inhibitor of cytochrome p450s  <cit> . furthermore, genetic linkage studies had associated permethrin resistance in alhf to the autosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  while pbo-suppressible resistance  had been mainly tied to autosome  <dig>  with minor factors linked to autosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the genetic linkage between an overexpressed p <dig> gene or protein and insecticide resistance appears to be an important step in establishing a causal link between a p <dig> gene and its role in resistance  <cit> . we therefore went on to examine the linkage of the three p <dig> genes with  <dig> house fly bc <dig> lines derived from crosses of alhf and a susceptible morphological marker strain, aabys, using allele specific pcr determination. the results revealed that both cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> were located on autosome  <dig>  whereas cyp4g <dig> was located on autosome  <dig>  of the house flies. given that cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> are highly induced in alhf and specifically located on autosome  <dig>  on which p450-mediated resistance in alhf has been mapped, it seems likely that the induction of cyp4d4v <dig> and cyp6a <dig> plays an important role in the development of insecticide resistance in alhf house flies. compared to the induction of the other two p <dig> genes, the relatively low level  of cyp4g <dig> induction obtained in the alhf house flies may suggest its relatively minor role in resistance.

cyp4g <dig> has been linked on autosome  <dig>  to our knowledge, this is the first report of a p <dig> gene located on autosome  <dig> of house flies. an earlier study indicated that although factors on autosome  <dig> were very important in the overall level of permethrin resistance in alhf house flies  <cit> , the resistance in alhf governed by them was not suppressed by pbo  <cit> . these conflicting results may suggest that an ~ <dig> -fold level of induction of a p <dig> gene is too small to be detected by a synergism study. alternatively, since pbo appears not to be a perfect inhibitor for some of the p450s responsible for resistance  <cit> , the product of cyp4g <dig> may not be sensitive to the inhibition of pbo and the corresponding level of resistance due to the metabolism ofthe gene may therefore not be suppressed by pbo.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides direct evidence that multiple p <dig> genes, cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig>  are up-regulated in insecticide resistant house flies through the induction mechanism. taken together with the induction of cyp4d4v <dig>  cyp4g <dig>  and cyp6a <dig> only in resistant house flies and the correlation linking the genes with the development of resistance and/or p450-mediated resistance in alhf, this study suggests the functional importance of these three p <dig> genes in the increased detoxification of insecticides in alhf. our previous studies  <cit>  have also indicated that two p <dig> genes are constitutively overexpressed in alhf house flies. taken together, these studies indicate that both p <dig> induction and constitutive overexpression may be co-responsible for detoxification of insecticides, evolutionary insecticide selection, and the ability of insects to adapt to changing environments.
