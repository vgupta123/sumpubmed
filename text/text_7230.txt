BACKGROUND
the human large intestine harbours up to  <dig> bacteria, whose combined degradative and biochemical capabilities greatly exceed those of their host. the interplay between the host and its gut microbiota, via degradative activities that yield nutrients and metabolites and via interactions with the immune system, is highly complex, but the consequences for human health are increasingly recognised. alterations in the gut environment and imbalances of intestinal homeostasis are associated with changes in microbiota composition during the development of gastrointestinal diseases  <cit> , while microbiota composition is also thought to influence energy recovery from the diet, metabolic regulation, hormone signalling and systemic health  <cit> .

although there is considerable variation in the gut microbiota even between healthy individuals, volunteer studies involving carefully controlled diets have now established that dietary intake exerts an important influence on the composition of the human gut microbiota . these changes may reflect selective growth promotion by dietary components that provide the main energy sources for gut bacteria, as well as inhibitory effects resulting in particular from lipid intake and bile metabolism  <cit> . human diets provide energy sources available to the large intestinal microbiota mainly in the form of non-digestible  carbohydrates . studies in which nd carbohydrate intake was varied in diets with matching macronutrient composition have established that the type of nd carbohydrate can alter microbiota composition, and that such changes occur within a few days  <cit> . prebiotics based on nd carbohydrates, especially inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides, are already widely used with the aim of stimulating bacterial species and activities that are considered beneficial to health among the resident microbiota  <cit> . most studies on prebiotics have focussed on selected target groups rather than the whole microbial community, but these also provide evidence for the selective stimulation of certain groups or genera within the human gut microbiota .

it is not possible to establish from in vivo studies whether changes in microbiota composition resulting from dietary supplementation with a nd carbohydrate are due to direct stimulation of growth by the substrate, or alternatively to indirect effects such as the acidification of the colon that follows the ingestion of any fermentable fibre due to subsequent generation of short chain fatty acids  by the microbiota  <cit> . this question can, however, be answered in vitro by using anaerobic ph-controlled continuous flow fermentors inoculated with human faecal microbiota. in previous work, we showed that, with nd polysaccharides  as a growth substrate, a one unit ph shift caused a major change in composition of the human colonic microbiota, with gram-negative bacteroides species predominating at ph  <dig> , but gram-positive firmicutes increasing at ph  <dig>   <cit> . we decided to use this approach to determine to what extent different nd carbohydrates affect the composition of the gut microbiota at a given controlled ph. specifically, the experiments reported here compare the impact of inulin and pectin upon the microbiota. inulin is a plant storage polysaccharide that consists of linear chains of fructose residues with a β- linkage and is the basis for many existing prebiotics. pectin comprises a highly complex set of plant cell wall polysaccharides that includes homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan i and ii, with side chains of arabinans, galactans, and arabinogalactans  <cit> . our results show that inulin and pectin exert highly selective effects upon the gut microbiota not at the phylum level, but at the level of individual species, with very little overlap between the two substrates in the species promoted. since ph is an important factor governing the competition between bacterial species  <cit>  and luminal ph differs between the proximal and distal colon, it was important to obtain information across the physiologically relevant ph range. responses are shown to be influenced quantitatively by the ph across the range  <dig> – <dig> . these findings have important consequences for our understanding of nutritional specialisation among human colonic bacteria and for predicting how diet composition, including the addition of prebiotics, can be used to manipulate microbiota composition.

RESULTS
influence of ph on competition for inulin and apple pectin in continuous culture
continuous flow anaerobic fermentors were used to investigate the impact of single polysaccharide substrates upon the species composition of gut microbiota from healthy human volunteers. two fermentors were run in parallel in each experiment; these received an identical faecal inoculum, but one was shifted in the sequence ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   and the other in the sequence ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  , with ph shifts being applied at 3-day intervals . apple pectin or inulin was provided continuously as the sole added carbohydrate energy source through the supply of fresh medium at a rate of one turnover per day . separate experiments were conducted for each substrate with faecal inocula from three different healthy volunteer donors, with the same three donors being used for the two sets of experiments.fig.  <dig> diagram showing the design of the fermentor experiments used in this study. single substrates  were supplied at a concentration of  <dig>  %. in each experiment, two vessels were run in parallel , with the same faecal inoculum and substrate. fermentor  <dig> was shifted in the sequence ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   and fermentor  <dig> in the sequence ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  . samples were collected daily for short chain fatty acid analysis and dna extraction was performed at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for qpcr and illumina miseq-based sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons. for each substrate, separate experiments were performed using faecal inocula from three different healthy volunteers 



impact of ph changes
changes in microbiota composition were assessed by analysis of bacterial 16s rrna genes using qpcr and illumina miseq sequencing of barcoded amplicons . data from ph upshift and ph downshift regimes for all donors are shown in fig.  <dig> for broad bacterial groups. with inulin as a substrate there was a significant effect of ph upon the proportion of bacteroidetes  and of bacteroides plus prevotella  . the percentage of bacteroidetes sequences increased significantly between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  both in f <dig> upshift  and in f <dig> downshift  fermentors . this is consistent with findings from previous in vitro studies in which starch was the major substrate supplied  <cit> . ph had the opposite effect on the proportion of actinobacteria sequences , which decreased significantly at ph  <dig>  compared with ph  <dig>  both in f <dig>  and f <dig>  fermentors.fig.  <dig> effect of ph on microbial community composition. 16s rrna gene-targeted qpcr data are shown for bacteroides spp.  with inulin and  with apple pectin as energy sources and for lachnospiraceae  with inulin and  with pectin. these refer to  <dig> fermentor runs , f <dig>  fermentors run in parallel for donors d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> with pectin or inulin) *p < <dig> , **p < <dig>  . results from illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons are shown in  at the phylum level for f <dig> and f <dig> fermentors for each substrate; these revealed significant effects of ph when analyzed by anova . miseq data represent merged data from the same  <dig> fermentor runs, but also include four additional  runs for d <dig> inulin  and d <dig> pectin . combined phylum and family level results from the sequence data are also shown for each substrate in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a list of operational taxonomic units obtained from analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences for all samples is given in additional file 2: table s1



with pectin as a substrate, ph again had a significant effect on the percentage of bacteroidetes sequences ; for this substrate, however, an increase in percentage bacteroidetes sequences between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  was seen only for the f <dig> downshift fermentors  and not for the f <dig> upshift fermentors . possible explanations for this intriguing effect of ph order are considered in the discussion. sequence analysis did not show a significant effect of ph upon percentage firmicutes or proteobacteria sequences for either substrate, although qpcr indicated a significant decrease in lachnospiraceae between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  with inulin as a substrate in f <dig> fermentors .

responses at the operational taxonomic unit  level
when analyzed at the phylum or family level , the illumina sequence data do not suggest a major effect of the polysaccharide substrate supplied upon community composition. when viewed at the otu level , however, a high degree of specificity is evident in the response to each substrate . careful manual curation of the otus allowed us to generate close approximations to species in many cases, although not all recognized species could be separated  while some less defined species  were represented by several otus . two otus derived from bacteroides  became strongly enriched in the inulin fermentors , whereas six different otus  became enriched in the pectin fermentors. the impact of ph is clearly seen in the inulin fermentors for b. uniformis and b. caccae , for which the proportional representation increased with increasing ph. within the firmicutes, one otu in particular, derived from eubacterium eligens, and a less abundant, uncultured relative of roseburia , were significantly enhanced by pectin relative to inulin . firmicutes otus that benefited from the provision of inulin included anaerostipes hadrus . based on the linear discriminant analysis effect size  method, several other firmicutes, including one f. prausnitzii otu , were also increased with inulin .fig.  <dig> bacteroidetes  and firmicutes  changes across ph at the operational taxonomic unit  level. merged data derived from illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons are shown from a total of  <dig> fermentor runs , f <dig>  fermentors run in parallel for donors d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> with pectin or inulin as substrates, plus additional repeat runs for d <dig> inulin  and d <dig> pectin ). ino = inoculum. corresponding otu numbers can be found in additional file 3: table s <dig> and a list of otus obtained from analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences for all samples is given in additional file 2: table s <dig>  centre lines show the medians; box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by r software; whiskers extend  <dig>  times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles, outliers are represented by dots

interspecies competition within individual microbiota
changes within individual experiments are shown in fig.  <dig> for selected otus. these illustrate the complexity of the competitive interactions that occur between bacterial strains within these microbial communities, and the influence of variation in composition between individual microbial communities. it can be seen  that the two bacteroides species found to be promoted by inulin did not co-exist in the same fermentor samples, with b. uniformis being dominant in the d <dig> and d <dig> experiments and b. caccae in the d <dig> experiments. interestingly, both b. uniformis and b. caccae were detected in all three inocula. this suggests that differences at the strain level are also important, e.g. the d <dig>  but not d <dig> or d <dig>  inocula harboured a b. caccae strain that can outcompete the b. uniformis strains present during growth on inulin.fig.  <dig> microbial competition within individual fermentor runs. changes in bacteroides species and in the firmicutes bacteria f. prausnitzii and eubacterium eligens are shown for  <dig> fermentors  that involved inocula from donors d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  the sequence of imposed ph changes is shown for each run. these plots show the proportional abundance of otus determined from analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences . three f. prausnitzii otus and one e. eligens otu were detected in inocula from all three donors, while a fourth f. prausnitzii otu <dig> was also detected in d <dig> and d <dig> inocula. similarly, four bacteroides otus  were present in inocula from all three donors. of the remaining four bacteroides otus shown, b. cellulosilyticus/intestinalis was not detected in d <dig> inocula, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. stercoris were not detected in d <dig> and d <dig> inocula, and b. eggerthii was not found in d <dig> inocula



the situation was more complex in the pectin-fed fermentors. b. vulgatus/dorei was apparently co-dominant with b. eggerthii in the d <dig> fermentors, with b. cellulosilyticus/intestinalis in the d <dig> fermentors and with b. stercoris in the d <dig> fermentors, with some indication of co-existence of co-dominant species at the same time-points. while b. vulgatus/dorei was detected in inocula from all three donors, b. stercoris and b. thetaiotaomicron were detected only in d <dig> and b. eggerthii and b. cellulosilyticus/intestinalis were not detected in d <dig> and d <dig> inocula, respectively. thus, the emergence of different co-dominant otus appears to reflect the variable abundance of different bacteroides species and strains in the inocula . eubacterium eligens was able to compete with the bacteroides species for pectin at certain ph values in all experiments, but was particularly successful in experiments with the d <dig> inoculum. in some of the downshift  fermentors the dominance of the bacteroides spp. was clearly curtailed or abolished at ph  <dig> , and this was mirrored by a sharp increase in the abundance of f. prausnitzii otus at this ph. this phenomenon can be seen for d1_f2_inulin, d2_f2_inulin, and d1_f2_pectin .

targeted qpcr detection of selected groups  and species  further confirmed the findings obtained from amplicon sequencing. e. eligens was undetectable in inulin fermentors but was prominent in pectin fermentors, especially for d <dig>  while the increase in f. prausnitzii, noted above, in certain fermentor communities at particular time points was again apparent .

impacts on community diversity
the diversity of the fermentor community was reduced by comparison with the faecal inoculum in all experiments , but remained stable over time between days  <dig> and  <dig> . diversity was apparently unaffected by the imposed ph shifts, but shannon diversity indices were significantly higher for pectin-fed than inulin-fed fermentors .fig.  <dig> bacterial diversity across ph range in inulin and pectin fermentors using both the shannon index  and inverse simpson index . centre lines show the medians; box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by r software; whiskers extend  <dig>  times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles, outliers are represented by dots. * indicates significant difference between the faecal inocula and all fermentor ph conditions . diversity estimates were derived from 16s rrna gene otu analysis of the  <dig> fermentor runs described in fig.  <dig> and shown in additional file 2: table s1



short chain fatty acids 
scfa concentrations were measured for all time points and the mean values across the whole ph range shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  this revealed that the proportion of bacteroides spp. and prevotella spp. present in the fermentor community  was positively correlated with the concentration of propionate measured at the same time point . the butyrate concentration was only weakly correlated to the combined abundance of two prominent groups of butyrate-producing bacteria, f. prausnitzii and roseburia spp. , which may reflect the known contribution of other firmicutes to butyrate production  <cit>  . scfa production from pectin at low ph was apparently unaffected by the direction of the ph change, but altered scfa proportions were observed with inulin as a substrate at ph  <dig>  after  <dig> days in the downshift fermentors . family level changes derived from the miseq data were in line with the shifts in microbiota composition reported earlier in fig.  <dig> .fig.  <dig> short chain fatty acids  in upshift and downshift fermentors. mean scfa values  and proportional abundance of bacterial families based on sequence analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons are shown for the  <dig> fermentor runs described in fig.  <dig>  significant changes in % scfa  are discussed in the text. anova revealed significant decreases in % bacteroidaceae between ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  in inulin fermentors f <dig>  and f <dig> , but with pectin only for the f <dig>  fermentors . % bifidobacteriaceae and % lachnospiraceae increased significantly at ph  <dig>  compared with ph  <dig>  in f <dig> inulin  and f <dig> inulin  fermentors, respectively



discussion
several different approaches can be employed to understand and predict the selective influence of nd carbohydrates upon the gut microbiota. analysis of carbohydrate active enzyme  complements from individual genomes  <cit>  and growth tests on isolated species  <cit>  may be indicative, but cannot predict how different organisms will compete and interact within the complex intestinal community. at the other extreme, in vivo feeding experiments cannot readily distinguish effects mediated via the gut environment, for example, changes in gut transit or ph, from the direct selective effects of the substrate. furthermore, in vivo nutritional studies do not provide precise control over the substrates available to the microbiota, since endogenous substrates such as mucin and other food components will always be present. the approach that we have adopted here of using in vitro continuous flow fermentors to study the human intestinal microbiota as a microcosm has the considerable advantage of allowing precise control over both substrate supply and ph.

detailed investigations into polysaccharide utilization have so far been mainly undertaken for bacteroides spp. among predominant human gut anaerobes  <cit> , although more recently studies have also been conducted in the firmicutes representative eubacterium rectale  <cit> . in bacteroides spp., genes responsible for the degradation of particular polysaccharides are organized at polysaccharide utilization loci  that also encode transport functions and transcriptional regulators. individual bacteroides genomes typically possess large numbers of puls  that are concerned with degradation of different host- and diet-derived polysaccharides  <cit> . variations in pul distribution between species have been demonstrated to correlate with the ability to utilize particular polysaccharides in vitro and in gnotobiotic animal models . our results show that all of the eight most abundant bacteroides otus present in the initial faecal microbiota gave a strong differential response in the mixed fermentor communities, being stimulated either by inulin  or by pectin . similar selectivity was evident for many firmicutes. among the top  <dig> otus , five firmicutes otus increased in abundance with inulin, while a further five firmicutes otus increased with pectin .

previous studies on cultured isolates indicated that pectin utilization is widespread among bacteroides spp., but relatively uncommon among human colonic firmicutes  <cit> . nevertheless, the strong and highly specific enrichment of the pectin-utilizing firmicutes species e. eligens  <cit>  could provide the basis for an effective prebiotic strategy while enrichment of one f. prausnitzii otu by pectin was also observed here. inulin stimulated the firmicutes species f. prausnitzii and a. hadrus  as has also been reported in an in vivo human study  <cit> . both species are butyrate-producing bacteria that offer potential benefits to health, via anti-inflammatory action in the case of f. prausnitzii  <cit> , and via conversion of d-lactate to butyrate in the case of a. hadrus  <cit> . in addition to promoting particular bacteroidetes and firmicutes otus, inulin also promoted some proteobacteria, including sutterella wadsworthensis. this may warrant further investigation as s. wadsworthensis has been isolated not only from healthy individuals but also from gastrointestinal disease states  <cit> .

many studies have shown that inulin has a bifidogenic effect in vivo  and there is also a report suggesting that pectin can be bifidogenic  <cit> . interestingly, we found no evidence in these experiments for an overall stimulation of bifidobacteria by inulin or pectin either from sequence analysis, even though b. pseudocatenulatum was detected as one of the  <dig> most abundant otus, or from qpcr monitoring of the bifidobacterium genus. since the representation of bifidobacteria was greatest at ph  <dig>  in the inulin fermentors , it therefore seems likely that the promotion of bifidobacteria by inulin that is observed in vivo depends critically on acidification in the colonic lumen that results from scfa production  <cit> . at ph values closer to neutrality our evidence suggests that other bacteria will tend to out-compete bifidobacteria for inulin. it is also known that the chain length of inulin is critical in determining its utilization by isolated gut anaerobes  <cit> , which can complicate the comparison of different studies. many isolated bifidobacteria cannot utilize long chain inulin, although they are able to benefit from fructo-oligosaccharide breakdown products via cross-feeding in co-cultures  <cit> . in general, metabolic cross-feeding involving partial degradation products, fermentation products and growth factors, but also inhibitory interactions, can be expected to have played a role in the community changes occurring in these studies  <cit> .

the overall decrease in microbiota diversity in the fermentor community relative to the faecal inoculum  is assumed to result mainly from the supply of a single substrate as energy source. by contrast, typical human diets supply a very wide variety of types of fibre and a wide array of host-derived glycans and proteins . another important factor is likely to be the relative stability of conditions within the fermentor compared with the fluctuations that occur in vivo as a result of periodic meals.

our experiments also show that ph exerts a strong influence on competition between bacteria from different phyla or families that share the ability to utilize the same polysaccharide. this effect was particularly clear for the inulin fermentors, where the proportion of bacteroidetes 16s rrna gene copies fell from around  <dig> % at ph  <dig>  to around  <dig> % at ph  <dig> . this suppression of bacteroides spp. at slightly acidic ph appears to reflect growth inhibition by scfas at ph values below  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, this trend was not evident for the pectin upshift fermentors where e. eligens was apparently able to compete with pectin-utilizing bacteroides spp. across the ph range. the correlation between bacteroides representation in the community and the proportion of propionate that was seen here has also been noted for faecal samples from an in vivo study  <cit> . this is assumed to reflect the dominant role of the succinate pathway, which is found mainly in the bacteroidetes among human colonic bacteria, in the formation of propionate from carbohydrates  <cit> . thus, there was considerable functional redundancy with respect to propionate formation, as substrate-driven changes in the dominant species of bacteroidetes appeared to have little influence. on the other hand, the species level changes seen here could potentially have many other effects on the host, including those via immune signalling and metabolite transformation and which will warrant investigation in future studies.

we observed some asymmetry in the response of the microbial community to low ph in parallel downshift and upshift fermentors that received the same inoculum. a possible explanation for this lies in the initial reduction in community diversity in the fermentors, discussed above. theoretical modelling suggests that diversity will also have decreased at the strain level as strains that have optimal characteristics for ph tolerance and substrate utilization are selected  <cit> . thus, the community at the start of the ph  <dig>  phase in the downshift fermentors was considerably less diverse than the inoculum that initiated the ph  <dig>  phase  in the upshift fermentors. this lower diversity may have led to the absence of bacteroides strains tolerant of ph  <dig>  at the end of the downshift runs, thus allowing the growth of more low-ph tolerant competitors such as f. prausnitzii  <cit>  and perhaps explaining the observed ‘blooms’ in f. prausnitzii that were seen in several fermentor runs . interestingly, sudden shifts in the ratio of bacteroides to f. prausnitzii have also been reported in vivo in human subjects  <cit> .

in summary, we have shown that two nd carbohydrates, inulin and pectin, promote very different community profiles when supplied as sole energy sources to human colonic microbial communities under conditions of controlled ph and turnover. notably, these differences were found to lie at the species level rather than at the phylum or family level. we found very little overlap between the species stimulated by the two substrates, implying that evolution in the highly competitive environment of the large intestinal microbiota has favoured a high degree of nutritional niche specialization at the species level. at the same time, it is evident that a number of phylogenetically distant organisms belonging to different phyla have evolved convergently to gain the ability to utilize the same substrates. with a simple homopolymer  as a substrate, a single species was found to dominate the community at a given ph, but several species were apparently able to co-exist on pectin at the same ph. it is likely that the extreme chemical complexity of pectin  <cit>  creates multiple nutritional niches which can explain the greater microbiota diversity seen in the pectin-fed relative to the inulin-fed communities. our experiments also show that the species that become dominant with a given substrate can vary for individual microbial communities, and are likely to depend on the precise mix of competing strains within each microbiota.

CONCLUSIONS
in view of these and other recent findings, dietary manipulation through supplementation with nd carbohydrates has considerable potential for modifying the composition of the human colonic microbiota, with the aim of benefiting health. however, our findings show that it is crucial to define the profile of bacterial species promoted by an intended prebiotic, as even closely related species within the human colonic microbiota have evolved distinct substrate preferences. bacterial populations that become promoted are likely to include species from outside the group originally targeted, and may potentially include harmful as well as beneficial organisms and also species whose effects on the host are unknown. our work also provides a compelling rationale for pursuing ‘synbiotic’ approaches, whereby prebiotic substrates are specifically matched with beneficial microbes that are capable of utilizing them in order to enhance their colonization and activities in vivo. this could involve specific combinations of prebiotics and probiotics, or target populations of resident bacteria. first, however, it is necessary to identify which species within the complex gut microbiota are likely to respond to a given dietary manipulation. the approaches described here can thus help us to focus the necessary research into the health consequences of dietary manipulation to the most relevant bacterial species.
