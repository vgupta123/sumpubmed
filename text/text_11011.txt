BACKGROUND
transcript abundance is modulated by transcript synthesis and degradation rates. in recent years, genome-wide profiling methods, such as rna-sequencing   <cit>  and gene-chip analysis  <cit> , have been used to study mrna expression and to identify genes expressed in specific tissues and developmental processes  <cit>  and in response to environmental stimuli  <cit> . such studies are generally designed to capture aspects of steady-state mrna abundance. in addition to transcriptional regulation, however, an understanding of gene expression networks obviously requires data on mrna degradation and other patterns of mrna expression regulation. recent research has indicated that proper mrna degradation is a component of cellular homeostasis maintenance and contributes to the precise adjustment of gene expression levels in response to various extracellular stimuli  <cit> . several highly conserved pathways for mrna degradation exist in eukaryotes. one such pathway proceeds in the 3′ to 5′ direction, with mrna decay beginning with deadenylation catalyzed by mrna deadenylases  <cit> . another mrna degradation pathway, from 5′ to 3′, is often initiated with cleavage of the monomethyl guanosine  by the dcp <dig> decapping enzyme  <cit> . dcp <dig> mainly cleaves m <dig> ,7g-capped rna and m7g-capped rna, while unmethylated capped rna is a poor substrate  <cit> . in addition, some internal cleavages, such as those involving the rna-induced silencing complex  directed by micrornas  or small interfering rnas, can initiate mrna degradation  <cit> . mirna-mediated degradation mainly occurs in the mirna:mrna pairing binding region  <cit> . similar mrna decay mechanisms have been reported in plants, with some studies indicating that mrna degradation is important for the control of gene expression during growth, development and many physiological transitions . the most recent study on this topic revealed that rna decay pathways function mainly via protecting transgenes and endogenous genes from inappropriate posttranscriptional gene silencing to regulate gene expression, and act as safeguards of plant development in arabidopsis  <cit> .

mirnas are ~21-nucleotide non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by base-pairing to their targets, resulting in gene degradation or translational inhibition in most eukaryotes. in plants, the mirna is almost completely complementary to its target gene and mediates cleavage of the target at the center of the paired region . the high-throughput method used to discover mirna targets in plants, which is based on computational prediction using a set of pre-defined rules  <cit> , leads to a large number of false positives. a more reliable, experimentally based approach involves the use of gene-specific 5′ rapid amplification of cdna ends  to validate mirna-target pairs  <cit> . using this method, however, every single predicted target must be independently verified, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. although many mirna-target pairs have been predicted, only a small fraction has been experimentally confirmed. one encouraging development is parallel analysis of rna ends , a novel approach for identification of mirna targets that is both high-throughput and reliable  <cit> . using this method, large-scale mirna–target pairs have been validated in species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit> .

most mirna/mirna* duplexes released from typical mirna precursor stem-loops undergo two cycles of cleavage by endonucleases: one at the loop-distal position and the other at the loop-proximal position  <cit> . in animals, the two steps are spatially separated and completed by two different enzymes; specifically, duplexes are first cleaved by drosha at the loop-distal position in the nucleus and then by dicer at the loop-proximal position in the cytoplasm  <cit> . in plants, the two sequential cleavages are both carried out by a dicer-like  enzyme  in the nucleus but the dcl <dig> sequential cleavage site is still poorly understood. recent research has shown that pare data can be used to probe patterns of mirna hairpin processing in plants  <cit> .

foxtail millet  is an important grass crop species widely planted in china. the genome of the foxtail millet cultivar yugu <dig> has been sequenced recently  <cit> . because of its trivial size and short life cycle, foxtail millet is an ideal model species for panicoideae crops and c <dig> photosynthetic species . over the long period of its improvement and domestication, foxtail millet has gradually adapted to semiarid and arid climates. because of its excellent drought tolerance and water-use efficiency, foxtail millet is an ideal material to investigate the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants. to deepen our understanding of mrna degradation and stress response mechanisms in plants, we therefore used the pare deep-sequencing approach in this study to analyze uncapped mrna transcripts under drought stress conditions in foxtail millet. pare was also used to identify potential targets for mirna-directed cleavage and to reveal multiple novel examples of mirna precursor processing in foxtail millet.

RESULTS
overview of pare-seq data in foxtail millet
to characterize mrna degradation changes during the drought stress response, we profiled uncapped transcripts using pare-seq  in 14-day-old foxtail millet seedlings. pare libraries were prepared from seedlings subjected to polyethylene glycol -simulated drought  and control  conditions, with two independent biological replicates for each group. we generated approximately  <dig> million and  <dig> million 50-bp reads from the control and drought-treated seedlings, respectively . after removing repeats/transposons  <cit>  and known non-coding rna   <cit>  sequences as described in the methods, the raw reads were mapped to the yugu <dig> reference genome  <cit>  using bowtie. the mapped reads, which accounted for about  <dig> – <dig>  % of the total reads from different pare-seq libraries, were used to measure gene degradation levels calculated as reads per million  . because comparisons of biological replicates showed that their expression values were highly correlated , we took the average rpm of the replicates as the degradation level.

we detected  <dig>  genes with uncapped transcripts in at least one of the samples according to the pare analysis. to explore whether 5′ to 3′ mrna degradation is associated with the drought response, we compared the degradation levels of these genes and found that  <dig> genes exhibited significant changes after drought treatment, with two-thirds of them up-regulated . this result demonstrates that the process of mrna degradation plays an important role in the drought response. for example, four late embryogenesis abundant  domain-containing protein genes were included in the list of the  <dig> most significantly up-regulated genes . this finding is consistent with previous reports that lea proteins are associated with cellular tolerance to dehydration induced by salinity, freezing or drying . in addition, we found that genes for two myb-family and one wrky-family transcription factor, which are regulators of various plant developmental and physiological processes in response to drought stress  <cit> , were among the  <dig> most significantly down-regulated genes in our experiments .fig.  <dig> drought stress-responsive genes at the degradation and transcription levels. a number of genes showing significant degradation level changes after drought treatment. b venn diagram showing significantly changed genes at the degradation and transcription levels under drought treatment. c correlation between fold-change values at the degradation and transcription levels after drought stress. correlation values  are pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficients. up arrow and down arrows represent up- and down-regulation after drought treatment, respectively. d coverage of parallel analysis of rna end reads and rna-sequencing reads on selected genes; each had two replicates. the genes si021866m and si013398m belong to type-i, si036695m and si022331m to type-ii and si016654m and si023461m to type-iv. “+peg” and “−peg” represent samples with  and without  peg treatment. the y-axis represents the normalized read depth

different transcript regulation patterns during the drought response
mrna synthesis and degradation both affect mrna abundance. to study the connection between mrna synthesis and degradation in transcript regulation under drought treatment, we next measured genome-wide gene expression levels using our previously published rna-seq data  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes showed significant expression level changes after drought treatment, with almost equal numbers up-regulated and down-regulated. in addition, we found that  <dig>  %  of genes displayed significant changes in both expression and degradation levels after drought treatment , implying the existence of different transcript regulation patterns during the drought response. to reveal the overall trend of mrna synthesis and degradation changes, we calculated the fold changes in gene expression and degradation levels for  <dig>  genes identified by both rna-seq and pare data analysis. we uncovered a positive correlation  between the fold-change values of transcription and degradation levels under drought conditions . we then classified these genes into nine categories with a log <dig> fold change of ± <dig> as the threshold, and found that  <dig>  %  of the genes were unchanged. the remaining  <dig> genes, comprising the other eight classes , were inferred to be involved in the drought response and regulated by either rna transcription or rna degradation. we further classified these drought-responsive genes into four types according to their characteristic changes  and performed a gene ontology  enrichment analysis using the wego online tool   <cit>  . we were thus able to aggregate genes with different transcript regulation patterns and view their functional classifications. notably, only two genes were found to belong to type iii , in which transcript and uncapped transcript abundance showed opposite trends. as a consequence, no further analysis was performed on type-iii genes.table  <dig> four different transcript regulation patterns in drought stress response

d: uncapped mrna abundance indicated by parallel analysis of rna end tags; r: transcript abundance indicated by rna-seq reads. genes with log <dig>  ≥  <dig> and a p-value <  <dig>  were considered as up regulated genes and genes with log <dig>  ≤ −  <dig> and a p-value <  <dig>  were considered as down regulated genes. genes with −1 < log <dig>  <  <dig> and a p-value >  <dig>  were designated as unchanged



type-i genes , which were characterized by transcript and uncapped transcript abundances changing in the same direction after drought treatment, were enriched in catalytic and various oxidation-related enzymes  in the molecular function category as well as the biological process subcategories ‘metabolic process’, ‘response to stimulus’ and ‘response to stress’ . pare and rna-seq read coverage is shown for two examples in fig. 1d. one of these genes, si021866m, encodes a dnaj heat shock n-terminal domain-containing protein. its homologous gene in arabidopsis thaliana plays an important role in cellular stress sensors  <cit> . the other example, si013398m, encodes a transcription factor belonging to the myb family reported to play crucial roles in plant responses to abiotic stress  <cit> .

genes in the type-ii category , comprising genes showing significant changes in uncapped transcript abundance after drought treatment but no changes in transcript abundance, were typified by si036695m, a no apical meristem  transcription factor, and si022331m, a bzip transcription factor . genes related to transcription factors, transcription regulators, pigmentation and regulation processes  were overrepresented in this group .

type-iv genes  showed significant changes in transcript abundance while their uncapped transcripts remained unchanged after drought treatment. genes associated with membranes were enriched in the cellular component category, and various important catalytic activities  in the molecular function category and ‘response to chemical stimulus’ and ‘oxidation reduction’ in the biological process category were heavily represented. si016654m, a representative of type iv , encodes an arginine decarboxylase  protein. previous studies have found that adc is involved in responses to salt, drought and other abiotic stresses , with other investigations revealing that transgenic adc rice plants show increased biomass under salinity-stress conditions compared with non-transformed controls  <cit> . si023461m, another type-iv example, encodes ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, the crucial enzyme in photosynthesis and photorespiration. sharkey et al.  <cit>  showed that mild water stress affects ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity in intact leaves.

detailed functional annotations for type-i, −ii and -iv genes are given in additional file  <dig>  taken together, our data demonstrate that different transcript regulation patterns exist during the drought response and may be correlated with gene function.

sequence characteristics correlated with different mrna decay patterns
sequence characteristics have been reported to contribute to uncapped mrna abundance  <cit> . to reveal the characteristics of mrnas with different decay patterns, we calculated the mrna lengths, gc contents, minimal folding free energy indexes   <cit>  of secondary structures, untranslated region  lengths and intron numbers for type-i, −ii and -iv genes . the results showed that the mean lengths of 5′ utrs, 3′ utrs and mrnas of type-i, −ii and -iv genes were significantly greater  than those of all genes and  <dig>  randomly selected genes . moreover, the mean mfei values of 5′ utrs, 3′ utrs and mrnas of type-i, −ii and -iv genes were significantly lower than those of all genes and randomly selected genes . in contrast, no significant differences were found for the mean gc contents of 5′ utrs and 3′ utrs among these gene groups . overall, the lengths and mfeis of utrs and mrnas correlated with the structural features of genes involved in the drought response.fig.  <dig> gene transcript features and sequence motifs contributing to different mrna decay patterns. a-d a display of mrna length, 5′ utr length, 3' utr length and number of introns for different gene types. “i”, “ii”, “iv”, “r” and “a” represent type-i, −ii, −iv, randomly selected genes and all genes, respectively. “***” indicates statistically significant difference at p-value <  <dig>  . e-h enriched motifs  in the 5' utrs of type-i , type-ii  and type-iv  genes



recent studies have revealed a relationship between introns and mrna stability  <cit> . in our study, the average number of introns in type i and iv genes was higher than in all genes and randomly selected genes , whereas no significant differences were found between type-ii genes and the latter gene categories . this result indicates that the number of introns has an obvious influence on drought-responsive genes, and this effect is related to mrna synthesis regulation rather than degradation regulation.

previous research has shown that enriched motifs in 5′ and 3′ utr regions can affect mrna stability  <cit> . we therefore used an integrated motif-discovery program   <cit>  to identify possible motifs located in the 5′ and 3′ utrs of type-i, −ii and -iv gene transcripts. we identified significantly enriched motifs  in the mrna 5′ utrs: one in type i , one in type iv  and two in type ii , implying the existence of some specific regulators or regulatory mechanisms in their 5′ utrs. next, we analyzed these enriched motifs using tomtom tool. the best-matched motif to ‘gga’  was rncmpt <dig> . the protein poly -binding protein  <dig>  was reported to bind the rncmpt <dig> motif  <cit>  and appears to be multifunctional  <cit> . rncmpt <dig> was the best-matched motif to ‘agaa’   and rncmpt <dig> was the best-matched motif to both ‘ttct’   and ‘aga’  . the binding protein for both rncmpt <dig> and rncmpt <dig> is serine/arginine-rich splicing factor  <dig>   <cit> . srsf <dig> is known to function as a sequence-specific splicing activator  <cit>  and can promote both exon inclusion and exclusion in chicken cells  <cit> . this suggests that some rna-binding proteins may play a role in the behavior of these gene classes. in contrast, no significantly enriched motifs were found in the 3′ utrs of type-i, −ii and -iv genes.

identification of endogenous mirna cleavage targets
in plants, mirnas play key roles in many developmental events and regulate their target transcripts through two modes of action: degradation and translation inhibition . in this study, pare-seq was used to identify the cleavage sites of targets mediated by mirna-programmed riscs  <cit> . using the pare data, we identified  <dig> putative mirna-guided cleavages in foxtail millet ; six prominent examples were selected for detailed discussion . mir <dig> guides cleavage within the coding regions of si005991m , si034525m  and si016509m . the proteins encoded by si005991m, si034525m and si016509m are homologs of a. thaliana auxin response factor  <dig> . a previous study determined that arf <dig>  targeted by mir <dig>  controls root cap cell formation in a. thaliana  <cit> . mir169c guides cleavage within the coding region of si037045m , while nov-sit-mir <dig> guides cleavage of si008818m  and si035794m . we found that the si008818m and si035794m proteins contain the same characteristic regions, namely qlq  and wrc  domains, as a. thaliana growth-regulating factor proteins . atgrfs are involved in cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon tissues  <cit> . examination of pare-seq and rna-seq reads mapping to the six mirna target transcripts  revealed a prominent cluster of reads at predicted cleavage locations in the pare libraries, while no such pattern emerged in the rna-seq library. these results, which reveal that mirna-mediated degradation is the main pathway of mrna degradation for some mirna targets, were visualized using the integrative genomics viewer  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

insights gained into mirna precursor metabolism
in plants, most primary mirnas  that are transcribed from mirna genes by rna polymerase ii undergo two sequential cleavages by dcl <dig> to yield an rna duplex containing the mature mirna and mirna* sequences  <cit> . the locations of pare tags mapped to the precursor can provide valuable hints to help reveal the details of the dcl1-guided two-step cleavage action on mirna precursors  <cit> .

to probe the patterns of mirna hairpin processing in foxtail millet, the pare reads in our datasets were mapped to  <dig> annotated  <cit>  foxtail millet mirna precursors . of the annotated pre-mirnas,  <dig>  had one or more matching pare tags . the matching pare tags were mainly mapped to precursors in one of two places: either the lower or upper cleavage site of the stem-loop 3′ arm. as shown in fig. 4a, the matching pare tags were mainly mapped to sit-mir166d, sit-mir166a- <dig>  sit-mir167b- <dig> and sit-mir529a precursors at the lower cleavage site of the stem-loop 3′ arm; this indicates that these pre-mirna hairpins could be processed by dcl <dig> via the classical loop-last mechanism  <cit>  in which the first cleavage of pre-mirna hairpins occurs at the loop-distal position . as shown in fig. 4c, in contrast, matching pare tags were mainly mapped to nov-sit-mir <dig>  sit-mir156b- <dig>  sit-mir319- <dig> and sit-mir <dig> precursors at the upper cleavage site of the stem-loop 3′ arm. this matching position implies that these pre-mirnas are processed by dcl <dig> via an unusual loop-first mode  <cit>  in which the first cleavage of pre-mirna hairpins occurs by precise processing at loop-proximal sites . it is noteworthy that this loop-first sequential processing of pre-mir <dig> family hairpins  is also seen in a. thaliana, physcomitrella and rice, and can generate two distinct mirna/mirna* duplexes  <cit> . we also discovered that all mir <dig> family precursors identified in our study  are processed via the loop-first mechanism, whereas all identified mir <dig> family precursors  are associated with the loop-last mechanism.fig.  <dig> pare tags mapping to foxtail millet mirna hairpins. a and c examples of “loop-last”  and “loop-first”  mirna precursor processing. b and d a diagram of “loop-last”  and “loop-first”  processing. regions within the pink and blue bars in  and  indicate the positions of the mirna and mirna* in the precursor, respectively. two distinct mirna/mirna* duplexes were generated from sit-mir319- <dig> and the two darker bars in sit-mir319- <dig> indicate the mirna/mirna* duplexes of nov-sit-mir <dig>  the read count at each position is indicated as a scatter plot



in pre-mirna hairpin processing, dcl1-mediated cleavage occurs on each strand of the stem region  <cit> . the resulting 3′ cleavage products with poly  tails can be cloned by pare high-throughput sequencing. if first-step cleavage occurs on both arms simultaneously, only cleavage signals mapped to the 3′ arm of pre-mirna hairpins will be detected. if first-step cleavage occurs on both arms non-simultaneously, however, cleavage signals mapped to both the 3′ and 5′ arms of pre-mirna hairpins will be identifiable in the pare data. our pare data showed hardly any cleavage signals mapped to the stem-loop mirna 5′ arm , indicating that first-step cleavage occurs on both arms, most likely simultaneously, during the processing of most foxtail millet mirna hairpins.

distinct mrna decay patterns among gene functional classes
as a diploid panicoid crop species, foxtail millet uses c <dig> pathway photosynthesis. although the leaves of c <dig> crops have increased nitrogen and water use efficiencies compared with c <dig> species  <cit> , virtually nothing is known about how the pathway is regulated under drought stress. in c <dig> photosynthesis, carbon is shuttled as a c <dig> acid from the mesophyll to the bundle sheath cells to create a co <dig> pump through a series of enzyme catalytic reactions. these enzymes include phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , malate dehydrogenase , nadp-malic enzyme  and pyruvate phosphate dikinase . using phytozome, we found  <dig> c <dig> carbon shuttle enzyme  genes in foxtail millet. to better understand the effect of drought on c <dig> enzymes, we analyzed the transcription and degradation of these  <dig> c4-related genes after peg-induced drought stress . the transcript abundance of nine genes  and the degradation abundance of eight genes  showed significant changes after drought treatment. among these drought-responsive genes, six displayed significant changes at both the transcription and degradation levels after drought treatment. these results suggest that various transcriptional and degradation regulatory mechanisms operate in c4-related genes under drought stress and may function to regulate water use efficiency in foxtail millet.fig.  <dig> expression pattern of c <dig> photosynthetic-related genes and mirna pathway-related regulators under drought stress. a and b heatmaps showing the degradation level  and transcription level  of genes encoding c <dig> photosynthesis pathway-related enzymes  and mirna pathway-related regulators . asterisks represent significant changes in transcription level after drought stress. number signs represent significant changes in degradation level after drought stress. “c-r” and “d-r” represent transcription levels in the control  and drought-treated  samples revealed by rna-seq. “c-d” and “d-d” represent degradation levels in the control  and drought-treated  samples revealed by pare-seq. c the distribution of the ratio of relative uncapped mrna abundance  versus total mrna abundance . c: control sample; d: drought-treated sample. “***” indicates statistically significant difference at p-value <  <dig>  



we also analyzed the effect of drought on relevant core regulators in the mirna pathway, such as ago, dcl and rna-dependent rna polymerase gene family members. unlike c4-related genes, none of the  <dig> mirna pathway-related regulator genes showed significant changes after drought treatment at the transcription or degradation levels . interestingly, we found that the largest numbers of transcripts of these mirna pathway-related regulators were enriched in uncapped forms . the distribution of relative uncapped to total mrna ratios was found to be significantly biased , which is consistent with results reported previously in arabidopsis  <cit> .

discussion
different transcript degradation patterns were revealed during drought stress responses
to examine both gene synthesis and gene degradation, which were revealed respectively by rna-seq and pare-seq, genes were divided into four groups according to their change patterns after drought stress .

type-ii genes  could not be detected by analysis of rna-seq data alone, as the amounts of synthesized mrna were unchanged by the environmental stress conditions. go analysis  and detailed functional annotation  revealed that many of the type-ii genes belonged to diverse families of transcription factors such as wrkys, mybs, bzips and nacs. many of these transcription factors play important roles in responses to drought stress  <cit> . two significantly enriched motifs were identified in the 5′ utrs of type-ii gene mrnas , implying the existence of some specific regulatory mechanism in this gene group. in contrast, the amounts of degraded type-iv gene  mrnas remained unchanged after drought treatment, whereas synthesized mrna quantities showed obvious alterations. in the go analysis, catalysis-related genes, such as hydrolases, isomerases, lyases, oxidoreductases and peroxidases , were obviously over-represented among type-iv genes. peroxidases are widely accepted as ‘stress enzymes’  <cit> . oxidoreductase can decompose h2o <dig> to water and molecular oxygen and is one of the key enzymes involved in the removal of toxic peroxides  <cit> . induction of the activity of these enzymes has been documented under a variety of stressful conditions, such as water stress , chilling  <cit>  and salinity  <cit> , implying that these type-iv genes may serve as an intrinsic defense tool to resist drought stress in foxtail millet.

in type-i genes , synthesized and degraded mrna amounts followed similar trends after drought treatment. the go enrichment analysis  indicated that these genes were enriched in catalytic and various oxidation-related enzymes, suggesting that these types of genes may be important regulators of reactive oxygen species removal to maintain redox balance under drought stress conditions. the amounts of synthesized and degraded mrnas showed opposite trends in type-iii genes  following drought treatment. unexpectedly, we detected only two type-iii genes, for which changes in intact mrna levels were enhanced by opposing changes in synthesis and degradation. however, in research on brachypodium distachyon under cold stress, there were  <dig> genes in type iii , but no obvious functional enrichment among these genes was found in go analysis  <cit> . there are three possible reasons for this difference:  plants may have different regulation patterns in response to different abiotic stresses ,  different plants, e.g., b. distachyon  and foxtail millet , have different adaptation mechanisms in response to environmental stress, and  plants have different regulatory mechanisms in response to different periods of abiotic stress . perhaps a strong organismal response was not needed because of the short  duration of the drought treatment in our study.

mirna targets
using the pare data in this study, we identified  <dig> putative mirna-guided cleavages in foxtail millet . thus far, the transcripts of eight protein-coding targets of mirna-mediated cleavage have been confirmed by gene-specific 5′ race in foxtail millet  <cit> . among these eight mirna targets, seven  were found in our pare data. a previous 5′ race analysis revealed that the si016508m gene has two cleavage sites  mediated by different mirnas  <cit> . we also identified these two breakpoints in the si016508m gene in our pare analysis . these results indicate that the mirna-guided cleavages identified by the pare analysis are genuine. a functional mirna is expected to regulate target transcripts through two modes of action, either degradation or translation inhibition  <cit> . because of the absence of detectable slicing, the pare analysis was unable to find targets of mirnas that act by repressing translation  <cit> .

in a previous study,  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in foxtail millet  <cit> . in our pare analysis, we confirmed the targets of 80 %  of these known mirnas, but only 34 %  of the novel ones . compared with known sit-mirnas, nov-sit-mirnas have been reported to have relatively lower expression levels and to exhibit higher tissue-specific expression  <cit> . thus, we may have identified smaller numbers of targets of known and especially novel mirnas because we did not analyze many developmental stages or different tissues.

analysis of mirna target expression after peg-induced drought stress revealed that  <dig> mirna targets were associated with different decay patterns during drought response . the expression levels of some mirna targets have been reported to be significantly altered after drought stress  <cit> . for example, nac genes targeted by mir <dig> negatively regulate drought resistance in rice  <cit> , and nuclear factor y, the target of mir <dig>  is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by mir <dig> to promote drought resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> . in our study, the nac protein genes si017567m and si010553m are also targets of mir <dig> and involved in response to drought stress. and si037045m, a nuclear factor y gene, is also targeted by mir <dig> and strongly induced by drought stress . in addition, previous research revealed that the expression levels of sit-mir <dig>  sit-mir <dig> and sit-mir <dig> were significantly altered after peg-induced drought stress in foxtail millet  <cit> . here, we found some of their targets, such as si001804m , si016509m  and si001277m , were associated with different decay patterns during the drought stress response .

besides their possible involvement in plant drought stress resistance, the mirna targets identified in this study also play fundamental roles in plant growth and development. for example, grfs targeted by nov-sit-mir <dig> have been shown to play an important role in cell expansion in leaf and cotyledon tissues in a. thaliana  <cit> . spls and ap <dig>  targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, are responsible for the juvenile to adult transition in arabidopsis  <cit> .

mirna precursor metabolism
the critical step of mirna biogenesis is the precise processing of mirna/mirna* duplexes from precursor mirna hairpins. our pare data suggest that both processing mechanisms exist in foxtail millet; some mirna biogenesis was consistent with loop-last processing , whereas the precise processing of some mirna precursors followed the unusual loop-first mode . we also observed that several different small rnas originated from the same mirna precursors. one such example is nov-sit-mir <dig>  and nov-sit-mir <dig> . this observation is consistent with prior research  <cit>  demonstrating that the mir <dig> precursor can generate more than one mature mirna in arabidopsis. a similar example was found in the pre-mir <dig> family , where two distinct mirna/mirna* duplexes were released from pre-mir <dig>  both through loop-first processing . previous research has also demonstrated the occurrence of precise loop-first processing of an artificially generated mirna with an arabidopsis mir <dig> backbone  <cit> . one possible explanation for these observations is that one or more cis-acting hairpin features may direct dcl <dig> first-cleavage of mirna hairpins at the loop-proximal position that is spatially separated from the loop-distal regions  <cit> . identifying the features that direct both loop-last and loop-first modes of precise plant mirna hairpin processing is an important goal for future research.

in addition to revealing sites corresponding to the remnants of the dcl-catalyzed cut, a previous study uncovered the existence of other cleavage signals in the middle of either mirna- or mirna*-coding loci on pre-mirnas that are mediated by mirna or mirna* self-regulation  <cit> . in our study, we detected cleavage signals in the middle of mirna- or mirna*-coding loci in sit-mir <dig> , nov-sit-mir144- <dig> and nov-sit-mir <dig>  precursors in foxtail millet. this finding is consistent with related observations in rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  that imply that mirna- or mirna*-mediated self-regulation of certain mirna precursors, although not widespread, exists in various organisms.

some unexpected cleavage signals were also detected in several mirna hairpins . for example, many different cleavage signals were detected in the region where mature nov-sit-mir121-1-5p and nov-sit-mir121-1-3p were located, while a few cleavage signals were found in other locations in the nov-sit-mir121- <dig> precursor. in addition, many different cleavage signals were detected in all nov-sit-mir <dig>  nov-sit-mir <dig> and nov-sit-mir <dig> precursors. similar unexpected results have also appeared in previous studies  <cit>  and could not be caused by methodological problems  <cit> . although the currently understood model of mirna biogenesis has been well studied  <cit> , some novel processes not yet revealed must be responsible for these unexpected results and need further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, mrna synthesis and degradation, revealed respectively by rna-seq and pare data, were both taken into consideration in a global exploration of gene expression regulation under drought stress. this global analysis revealed new insights into gene expression under drought stress, confirmed many known regulatory mechanisms, and provided a window into many additional potentially novel pathways. specific degradation patterns, such as mirna mediation of target degradation and dcl1-mediated mirna biogenesis were uncovered. our results will not only deepen the understanding of mrna degradation under stress conditions, but will also allow further insights into many targets of both known and novel mirnas. finally, these findings shed light on mirna-precursor processing mechanisms in gramineous crops and biofuel grasses, which have close evolutionary relationships with foxtail millet.
