BACKGROUND
multigene families have played a fundamental role in the evolution of metazoan genomes . mechanisms such as gene duplication, gene conversion, and lineage diversification underlie multigene family complexity and contribute to genetic patterns that can be extremely difficult to molecularly characterize  <cit> . whereas processes such as positive selection and lineage diversification can yield gene copies of increasing nucleotide divergence, opposing processes such as gene duplication and gene conversion can yield copies that are so similar that they are virtually impossible to distinguish from sequencing error  <cit> . the accurate characterization of gene copy number is fundamental to the differentiation of paralogy and orthology, and by extension, to the identification of heterozygotes versus homozygotes. this latter distinction is in turn central to determining the effects of genotype on phenotype, with the mhc  gene family offering a classic example .

given the intrinsic interest of accurate gene copy representation, it follows that methods of molecular characterization should be highly sensitive both to levels of low nucleotide diversity and to regions of high complexity. unfortunately, such is not presently the case for organisms that lack a well-characterized genome: i.e., non-model organisms. although low-coverage “draft” genomes are increasingly available for non-model organisms, these draft genomes are notoriously unreliable for accurate gene calling, particularly for regions of high genomic complexity  <cit> . thus, until such time that high-coverage, fully-assembled and annotated genomes are available for all species of interest, alternative molecular methods are desirable.

long-read next generation sequencing technologies provide unique opportunities for genome-based research of non-model organisms  <cit> . recent upgrades to the pacific biosciences rs instrument have improved sequence accuracy of circular consensus sequencing  yielding high-quality sequences about  <dig> to ~ <dig>  base pairs in length. ccs allows for the repeated sequencing of individual inserts and, depending on template length, stochastic sequencing errors are reduced with each ccs pass  <cit> . here, we investigate the utility of smrt ccs as an alternative to traditional approaches to sequencing large closely related gene families . we used smrt ccs technology, in combination with clustering algorithms and phylogenetic analyses, to measure subfamily gene diversity of vomeronasal g protein-linked receptors within a non-model primate, the gray mouse lemur . this species was selected for analysis for several reasons. first, recent work has shown that the v1r complex is extremely diverse with a very high proportion of intact gene copies in this primate, perhaps having the highest proportion of functional v1r copies of any mammal  <cit> . second, a draft genome is available for comparison against which we can validate the data generated by our study. and third, a deep-coverage fully-assembled genome is expected for release within the coming year  allowing for final validation of gene copies generated from more approximate methods .figure  <dig> 
experimental design for characterization of v1r diversity using pacbio circular consensus sequencing. 1) phylogenetic analyses of existing data are performed to identify and select clades of closely related sequences . 2) individual subfamilies are aligned and evolutionary conserved regions are identified for pcr primer design. 3) double stranded pcr amplicons are used for library preparation and circular consensus sequencing is performed. 4) ccs sequences are filtered based on ccs pass and average phred score. sequences are demultiplexed based on length, phylogenetic clustering, or barcode. 5) cluster analyses are performed on filtered ccs data, de novo chimera detection methods remove putative pcr chimeras, cluster alignments are checked for accuracy, and consensus sequences are generated. 6) consensus sequences are validated based on comparisons across individuals or with existing sequence data.



the vomeronasal organ  is the primary olfactory organ responsible for pheromone detection in mammals and two families of vno g protein-linked receptors  allow for the recognition of different classes of chemosensory cues. v1rs are typically encoded by a single coding exon  and are distantly related to bitter taste receptors whereas v2rs are encoded by multiple coding exons and are closely related to ca2+-sensing receptors . much research has been directed to distinguishing v1r receptors, owing to their single coding exon and relatively short sequence length characteristics  <cit> . however, despite recent advancements in the understanding of v1r sequence diversity in mammals  <cit> , relatively little is known about the intra-specific or intra-individual  v1r diversity of many non-model species. this is because v1r repertories are hypothesized to evolve rapidly and are likely lineage-specific, resulting in relatively few one-to-one orthologs between species  <cit> . these factors make characterization of the v1r repertoire difficult for dna sequence based studies because i) traditional approaches to sequencing large, closely related gene families can be time consuming and expensive , and ii) short-read high-throughput sequence data of such gene families are difficult to assemble given high sequence similarity and the potential for multiple paralogs to exist throughout the genome.

many prosimian species  have evolved highly specialized pheromone communication mechanisms and are hypothesized to have a large number of functional v1r genes . in particular, mouse lemurs practice complex chemosensory communication  and accordingly, species of mouse lemurs have diverse v1r repertoires  <cit> . we present smrt ccs data from two v1r subfamilies of two individuals of the gray mouse lemur . our study is designed to make comparisons of a biological nature  and of a methodological nature . in order to make these comparisons, we generated sequences via ccs of the same individual m. murinus from which the draft genome was generated/assembled . a second individual was included to enable comparisons within a single genome versus comparisons between genomes within a single species. this second individual was also used in a previous study of strepsirrhine v1r variation that utilized sanger sequencing of cloned amplicons  <cit>  . in summary, our study design allows for comparison of sequence characterization of a complex multigene family derived from distinct methods and sequencing technologies .table  <dig>

clustering analyses resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  v1ri clusters and  <dig>  and  <dig>  v1rix clusters for m. murinus  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . of these, approximately 18% and 17% of v1ri clusters and  <dig> % and  <dig> % of v1rix clusters were identified as putative chimeras, m. murinus  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . the majority of the chimeras  consisted of singleton clusters and only  <dig> chimeras had cluster sizes greater than a 7× threshold. clusters consisting of putative chimeras were removed prior to all downstream analyses. results of cluster analyses, including de novo chimera detection results, are presented in table  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we identified  <dig> clusters as consisting of putative pseudogenes and these were also excluded from downstream analyses. final analyses were performed on consensus sequences from  <dig> and  <dig> v1ri clusters and  <dig> and  <dig> v1rix clusters for m. murinus  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . these consensus sequences were aligned using 98% and 99% similarity thresholds  in order to determine the minimum and maximum number of v1r genes obtained using pacbio ccs technology . for m. murinus  <dig>   <dig> ccs v1r genes were not identified in sequences mined from the draft genome  <cit>  and are considered novel.

young et al.
 <cit>  identified ~ <dig> functional v1r genes within the draft m. murinus genome. our m. murinus  <dig> is the same individual from which the draft m. murinus genome was sequenced, thus allowing for validation of our newly generated v1r ccs data. using a minimum of 7× coverage, and a 98% similarity threshold, we recovered  <dig> of  <dig> functional v1ri subfamily sequences present within the m. murinus draft genome and  <dig> of these sequences were identical across all base pairs . when low coverage ccs reads were considered  100% of draft genome v1ri sequences were recovered . of the ccs v1ri gene copies that we recovered, five were unique to the ccs data; i.e., they were not identified within the draft genome assembly in a previous study  <cit> . collectively, the v1ri data  suggest a conservative estimate of that subfamily repertoire to be  <dig> loci for the subfamily repertoire, a 12% increase from sequences recovered from the draft genome . nucleotide diversity, estimated mutation rate, and average number of nucleotide differences between v1ri sequences originating from ccs and those gathered from the m. murinus draft genome were similar , with no significant difference being observed in the nucleotide variation between sequences generated by ccs technology and the draft genome v1ri repertoire .figure  <dig>

discussion
insights into the microcebus murinusv1r repertoire
chemosensory communication has played a critical role in mammalian evolution from both physiological and behavioral perspectives. in particular, many species rely heavily on pheromones for intraspecific communication, especially with respect to sexual and social behaviors  <cit> . of all mammalian orders, primates exhibits what is perhaps the greatest variation of functional versus pseudogenized v1r diversity  <cit> . for example, no functional v1r genes have been identified in the macaque  genome whereas ~ <dig> intact v1r genes have been identified in m. murinus
 <cit> . this proportion of functional versus pseudogenized v1r genes is likely correlated with a reduction of pheromone communication in some primate lineages , whereas lineages that have maintained or evolved enhanced chemical communication typically exhibit diverse v1r repertories . in particular, mouse lemurs practice complex chemosensory communications and m. murinus has one of the highest proportions of functional vs. pseudogenized v1r repertories of all mammalian species characterized thus far  <cit> . our results reinforce this finding and suggest that the functional v1r repertoire of m. murinus has likely been underestimated, perhaps by as much as 25% in the v1ri and v1rix subfamilies, collectively. this observation, coupled with recent documentation of strong positive selection throughout the mouse lemur v1r repertoire  <cit> , strengthens hypotheses regarding the highly specialized pheromone communication mechanisms used by species of lemurs .

while the putative function of the v1ri subfamily is unknown  <cit> , the available data indicate that this subfamily binds a diverse variety of ligands  <cit> . alternatively, the genetic variation within the v1rix subfamily suggests this subfamily is more conserved, perhaps binding to a reduced number of ligand classes . this hypothesis is reinforced by the observation that the two individuals examined herein share ~84% of their v1rix repertoires, compared to ~60% shared v1ri loci, at the 98% sequence similarity threshold. moreover, we identified three v1rix loci that were identical between m. murinus  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas zero v1ri loci were identical between the two individuals. these results support previous studies that have hypothesized differing rates of evolution within lemurid v1r subfamilies  <cit> . based on comparisons with putative mouse orthologs, hohenbrink et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that the v1rix subfamily was closely related to the mouse v1rc subfamily, a subfamily that has been shown to detect female, heterospecific, and predator cues in mice  <cit> . future studies focused on the identification of the ligands associated with the nine known v1r subfamilies present in m. murinus will be an important advance for understanding the functional roles of these gene families and whether or not genetic variation underlying v1r repertoires contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries within the genus.

utility of ccs for gene family characterization and discovery in non-model species
sanger sequencing of cloned inserts is a well-established and common approach for characterizing multigene family diversity . although effective, this method can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. a growing number of studies utilize next generation sequencing technologies for targeted approaches to gene validation and discovery  <cit> . these technologies have limitations however, and issues such as systematic and stochastic error rates as well as average read lengths must be considered when developing experimental designs  <cit> . we selected pacific biosciences smrt sequencing technology because the long read lengths eliminated the necessity for downstream assembly of highly similar fragments and because ccs reduces stochastic error rates. moreover, the option of filtering reads by number of ccs pass provides greater flexibility to quality control of pacbio sequence data. recent advancements to the pacbio rs sequencing instrument and sequencing chemistry have improved read length and accuracy  <cit>  and, as of this writing, pacific biosciences has released the rs ii upgrade which allows for higher throughput and even greater read accuracy.

relatively few studies have utilized pacbio ccs for targeted sequencing in non-model species  <cit> . in the absence of high quality genome assemblies, the long read lengths provided by smrt ccs offer new opportunities for characterizing complex multigene families . the observation that our clustering approach of ccs reads resulted in capturing 100% of v1ri sequences mined from the draft genome assembly , coupled with the identification of  <dig> putatively novel genes , documents that the methods reported herein are useful for gene discovery and for describing the diversity of large gene families. moreover, no bias was detected in the nucleotide variation of sequences originating from ccs clusters with respect to those mined from the draft genome  <cit>  or generated via sanger sequencing of cloned inserts  <cit>  . our results concerning the reduced coverage of the v1rix subfamily  likely stem from pcr amplification bias and/or preferential sequencing of the shorter v1ri sequences in pooled sequencing libraries. this finding, in addition to the identification of putative pcr chimeras by de novo chimera detection software , generally agrees with other studies that have identified pcr bias and pcr artifacts within data originating from high-throughput sequencing of pcr amplicons  <cit> .

although our experimental design is useful for identifying potentially unrecognized gene diversity, a major drawback is the inability to distinguish closely related paralogs and to reliably identify orthologs among individuals. this problem is compounded by the observation that v1rs are encoded by a single exon  <cit>  and therefore lack intronic sequences that may help to identify orthologs and/or paralogs. thus, future studies aimed at characterizing v1r gene diversity in non-model species may benefit from other methods such as the targeted capture and sequencing of genomic regions harboring v1r genes . such an approach would be useful for identifying orthologous and paralogous genes and for characterizing allelic variation in multigene families of non-model species.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the v1r repertoire of m. murinus is larger than previously hypothesized and underscore previous observations that low coverage genome assemblies provide a limited view of multigene-family diversity  <cit> . even so, it is probable that we have still underestimated v1r diversity given the potential for the clustering of closely related paralogs . importantly, the forthcoming availability of a high coverage  m. murinus genome  will allow our hypotheses regarding the v1r repertoire size to be more definitively tested.

pacific biosciences smrt ccs provides an alternative to traditional sanger sequencing of cloned inserts. we anticipate that the methods described herein will be useful for the characterization of diverse gene families in other non-model species where genome sequences are unavailable or consist of low coverage draft assemblies. our results concerning the presence of putative pcr artifacts agree with previous observations  <cit>  and necessitate the implementation of strict quality control measures when high-throughput sequencing is performed on libraries constructed from pcr amplicons. modifications to our approach, such as barcoding and advanced targeted capture methodologies will be useful for increasing sample size and gene discovery. these methods will greatly advance genome assembly and annotation of multigene families in non-model species.
