BACKGROUND
the genus bacillus is a heterogeneous group of gram-positive heterotrophic aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacilli that form environmentally resistant, metabolically inert spores
 <cit> . these soil-borne organisms are ubiquitous, and occupy surprisingly diverse environments
 <cit> . within this large genus, the b. cereus sensu lato group consists of seven species b. anthracis , b. cereus , b. mycoides, b. pseudomycoides, b. thuringiensis , b. weihenstephanensis  and b. cytotoxicus, based on classical microbial taxonomy
 <cit> . more recent molecular phylogenies and comparative genome sequence analysis indicate that these organisms should more accurately be viewed as a single species
 <cit>  despite their phenotypic diversity. indeed, the various species of the bc sensu lato group are phylogenetically interspersed among one another in several phylogenies
 <cit> . although the population has a clonal character, there do not appear to be clonal lineages that are species-specific, with the exception of the ba lineage
 <cit> . some bc sensu lato organisms are thermophiles
 <cit> , while bw is a psychrophile
 <cit> . nevertheless, most bc sensu lato isolates are mesophiles, found in a breadth of locales including the soil, on plant surfaces and the mammalian gastrointestinal microflora
 <cit> . some bc sensu lato members appear to be nonpathogenic, while others cause diverse disease ranging from food poisoning  to gastroenteritis
 <cit> , endophthalmitis
 <cit> , tissue abscesses
 <cit> , and aggressively invasive systemic disease, including anthrax
 <cit> . bt strains can cause disease in insects
 <cit>  and possibly nematodes
 <cit> , while some bc strains are part of the normal insect gut flora
 <cit> .

thus, these organisms appear to have arisen from a common ancestor to display impressive phenotypic diversity while nevertheless occupying a close phylogenetic space. what mechanisms produced this dichotomy? horizontal gene transfer , mobile genetic elements, and the routine processes of insertion/deletion  formation have typically been invoked to explain the diversity in these organisms
 <cit> . clearly, the presence of mobile genetic elements such as the virulence plasmids pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> in the ba lineage, and the cry toxin plasmids in various bt strains, are essential for the signature phenotypes of these organisms
 <cit> . on the other hand, it is unclear how much of the phenotypic diversity in these organisms can be explained by these mechanisms. as a whole, bc sensu lato organisms have an extremely high degree of chromosomal synteny
 <cit> , and whole genome comparisons between these organisms reveal a highly similar gene content
 <cit> . han et al. <cit>  suggested “that differential regulation  modulates virulence rather than simple acquisition of virulence factor genes”, a conclusion confirmed by other studies
 <cit> . this proposition is consistent with observations that the most evolutionarily flexible portions of the bacterial genome are regulatory sequences and transcriptional networks
 <cit> .

we decided to explore the divergence within the bc sensu lato group by examining the divergence of the sigb regulons in these organisms. the sigb locus encodes an alternative sigma factor with orthologs confined to the bacillus, staphylococcus and listeria genera
 <cit> . in each of these, the sigb protein is responsible for transcriptionally activating the generalized stress response when induced by a variety of stressors, including heat, osmolarity, organic solvents, low ph or cell-wall active antibiotics
 <cit> . in these organisms, sigb appears to control virulence-related functions including biofilm formation and invasion
 <cit> . some data that suggest that components of the sigb-mediated stress response vary between strains of listeria and of s. aureus in a lineage-dependent manner
 <cit> . this suggests that part of the evolutionary differentiation that occurred within these genera included divergence of the structure of the sigb-controlled regulons.

the divergence of the sigb regulon in the bc sensu lato group appears to be similar. lapidus et al. <cit>  observed that b. cytotoxicus  is likely the most similar of the bc sensu lato organisms to the nearest common ancestor of the group, based on comparative genome analysis and 16s rrna phylogeny. our whole genome single-gene phylogeny
 <cit>  supports the placement of b. cytotoxicus at the base of the phylogeny of the bc sensu lato group. important in the present context, the b. cytotoxicus genome lacks the entire sigb operon
 <cit> , including the sigb gene and the primary regulatory loci that control sigb activity, rsbv  and rsbw . consequently, the b. cytotoxicus genome does not encode either the sigma factor or associated sigb regulatory genes, and cannot mount a sigb-activated stress response. lapidus et al. suggested that an organism similar to b. cytotoxicus was likely the ancestor of the remainder of the bc sensu lato lineage, which arose after receiving the sigb operon during an hgt event. consistent with this, we were unable to find convincing evidence of sigb binding sites in the b. cytotoxicus genome that correspond to sigb promoters in other members of the bc sensu lato group . an alternative explanation, that b. cytotoxicus had lost the sigb operon and other genomic information during streamlining of a larger genome
 <cit> , is less likely. in that instance, we expect that detectable remnants of the sigb regulon  would remain in the b. cytotoxicus genome. thus, the introduction of an intact sigb operon into a b. cytotoxicus-like ancestor, likely by hgt as suggested by lapidus et al., appears to have set the stage for the emergence of the sigb-controlled stress response regulon in the entire bc sensu lato group. from this perspective, the b. cytotoxicus genome therefore is a convenient lens through which to view the appearance and divergence of the sigb regulon in the remainder of the bc sensu lato group. exploiting experimental data derived from bc strain atcc14579
 <cit> , we used an in silico approach to predict and compare the sigb regulons of the completed genomes of  <dig> members of the bc sensu lato group. not surprisingly, protein coding sequence indels play an important role in the divergence of these regulons. however, changes in promoter sequence between members of the bc sensu lato group that ‘re-purpose’ conserved genes into/out of the sigb regulon appear to be more common than indel formation for remodeling the structure of this regulon during divergence. four different lineages of the sigb regulon appear to have arisen during this process. one lineage appears to carry the core sigb regulon that arose after the emergence of these organisms from a b. cytotoxicus-like ancestor. this lineage appears to have given rise to three additional groups that each appropriated different genes from a common gene pool into the sigb regulon, suggesting different strategies for the support of pathogenesis by the sigb-mediated generalized stress response.

RESULTS
sigb binding site model building and regulon predictions
we began with nine 150bp dna sequences encompassing the sigb-dependent promoters identified by van schaik et al. <cit> , expanded to  <dig> sequences by phylogenetic footprinting
 <cit> . redundant sequences were removed from this collection to yield a final training set of  <dig> sequences. the training set was then used in parallel to develop separate hmm and pwm models for the sigb-dependent promoters in the bc sensu lato group. our models are virtually identical to previously derived models for this dna binding site in bc atcc14579
 <cit>  and b. subtilis <cit>  . each model was used to scan all genomes for potential sigb binding sites, and this information was coupled with transcriptome-derived transcriptional unit  predictions to arrive at a predicted regulon structure for each organism.
 <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer leading to insertion of novel genes, gene duplication and divergence, or gene deletion events, are thought to be the most common mechanisms responsible for remodeling bacterial genome function. collectively, these events can be easily identified as the insertion or deletion  of protein coding sequence, although the underlying mechanism responsible for the appearance of an indel is not so easily surmised. surprisingly, preliminary manual comparison of the predicted sigb regulons of the bc sensu lato group suggested that the appearance of indels was not the predominant mechanism of divergence of these sigb regulons. in the majority of instances, differences between sigb regulon structure appeared to arise from the placement of sigb-specific promoters in the 5’ region of tus that were shared among these organisms. that is, sigb regulon divergence appeared to rely on a process of promoter ‘re-assignment’ of genes from a common gene pool into/out of the sigb regulon. this promoter re-assignment appears to predominate over instances of indels that changed the total coding capacity of a given sigb regulon. to get a better quantitative measure of this impression, we performed pairwise comparisons of the predicted sigb regulons of all bc sensu lato genomes , by calculating a simple ratio of the number of predicted promoter changes to the number of observed indel events, for each pair of regulons. a promoter change occurs during the comparison of dna sequence upstream of orthologous genes in which one gene contains a predicted binding site with a significant score while the second either does not contain a predicted binding site, or contains a predicted binding site that has a score that is not significant. the results confirmed that the predominant mechanism for divergence of these regulons relied on the assignment of new sigb promoters to genes from a common gene pool . we extended this comparison by constructing a heat map summarizing the structures of the predicted sigb regulons in the bc sensu lato group . this heat map is color-coded: green blocks indicate the presence of a gene predicted to be in a tu controlled by a sigb promoter, while blue blocks indicate the presence of an orthologous gene not controlled by sigb. red blocks indicate that the ortholog in question is absent from the genome.

cluster analysis of the genes predicted in the sigb regulons of these genomes grouped these genes into seven clusters; within these, we identified an additional three subclusters that appear to have functional significance . this cluster analysis defined a core sigb regulon  that included genes common to the sigb regulon in all bc sensu lato organisms. additions to this core regulon  appear to be clade-specific. it is important to note that the hmm and pwm scores for each of the predicted promoters in clusters 3– <dig> were statistically indistinguishable from those in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  that is, the predictions for the promoters for gene clusters 3– <dig> were as strongly supported as those in the core sigb regulon, including tus for which supporting experimental evidence exists
 <cit> . note also that the bulk of gene cluster  <dig> , and clusters  <dig> and  <dig> provide relatively modest additions to the core sigb regulons of these organisms. in contrast to gene clusters  <dig>   <dig>  3a, 4a/b and  <dig>  there does not appear to be any pattern to the additions in clusters 3b,  <dig> and  <dig>  instead, these gene clusters appear to represent noise in the data set. since the genomes examined in this study were annotated by as many as eight different sequencing groups over a span of seven years , the lack of standardization in these various annotation schemes appears to be the basis for much of the noise in these gene clusters .

the core sigb regulon
analysis of the sigb regulons in each genome suggested that these organisms could be assigned to four clades a through d , based on the constituents of the sigb regulon predicted for each organism. clade c consists exclusively of b. anthracis strains; this is not surprising, as these organisms are highly monomorphic. the size of this clade in comparison to clades a, b and d is somewhat misleading, due to the overrepresentation of these genomes in the data set. nevertheless, this cluster analysis approximates relationships that closely mirror other phylogenetic hypotheses for the bc sensu lato group
 <cit> ; this is significant in that the relationships in figure
 <dig> are based on the structure of the sigb regulons , rather than from dna or protein sequence alone. the core sigb regulon  includes essentially all of the sigb-controlled genes found in clade b organisms, with few exceptions. comparison of this core regulon to the b. cytotoxicus genome  revealed that  <dig> of  <dig>  genes in the core regulon are orthologous to b. cytotoxicus genes. assuming that the b. cytotoxicus genome reflects the ancestral state prior to the introduction of sigb into this lineage, this suggests that the genes listed in table
 <dig> pre-dated the introduction of sigb into the bc sensu lato lineage. these genes were subsequently recruited into the sigb core regulon by the assignment of a sigb promoter after the appearance of sigb. orthologs of the remaining  <dig> genes of the sigb core regulon  were not found in b. cytotoxicus, and presumably were added later. at least  <dig> of the core regulon genes encode hypothetical proteins, presumably arising in the bc sensu lato group by hgt. most of the remainder of the genes in this group are members of large gene families  that likely became part of the sigb regulon by promoter re-assignment, possibly following a gene duplication event. however, the timing of the introduction of the sigb operon into the bc sensu lato group and the appearance of these genes is uncertain, as is when these genes became incorporated into the sigb regulon.

 
all of the sigb-controlled genes originally described by van schaik et al. <cit>  are found in this core regulon. we identified  <dig> additional genes that are predicted to be in the core sigb regulon . many of the additional genes encode regulatory proteins, whose altered transcription may be difficult to detect by microarray analysis, and whose regulatory control may be difficult to ascertain in the absence of experimental data. another large group of genes added to the core regulon are predicted to encode hypothetical proteins. as a consequence, it is difficult in most instances to predict how these additional genes contribute to the function of the core sigb stress response.

the discrepancy between our predictions and the data of van schaik et al. is not surprising; similar difficulties in cataloguing the complete sigb-dependent response have been encountered in other systems. for instance, as noted by nannapaneni et al. <cit> , three independent b. subtilis studies identified over  <dig> sigb-dependent target genes, but only  <dig> genes were commonly identified in all studies. after extensive testing in a variety of experimental conditions including ethanol and butanol shock, osmotic and oxidative stress, low-temperature growth and heat shock, nannapaneni et al. demonstrated  <dig> genes that appeared to be part of the b. subtilis sigb-controlled response;  <dig> of these also were controlled by secondary regulators. earlier discrepancies were likely due to differences in growth conditions, microarray platforms and the experimental setups employed. similarly, the experiments of van schaik et al. likely identified a subset of the total sigb-dependent genes in bc atcc <dig>  as these experiments employed a short heat shock
 <cit>  or overexpression of the sigb protein
 <cit> , and were not as extensive as those of nannapaneni et al. secondary regulators interacting with the sigb regulon also are a likely complication. in s. aureus, spovg fine-tunes sigb-dependent regulation by antagonizing sigb
 <cit> . in l. monocytogenes, sigb regulatory control is intertwined with that of hrca
 <cit> , ctsr
 <cit>  and prfa
 <cit> , complicating the analysis of sigb-mediated effects. in addition to the secondary regulators found in gene clusters  <dig> and  <dig> , additional regulatory proteins are included in clade-specific sigb regulons , and may modulate the control of gene expression by sigb, confounding the results of in vitro experiments. thus, gene clusters  <dig> and  <dig> in figure
 <dig> likely are a more comprehensive representation of the total sigb core regulon in the bc sensu lato group than the early studies of van schaik et al..

additions to the core sigb regulon
clade a and clades c/d organisms appear to have evolved different pathogenic potentials, and this likely is supported by the gene sets added to the core sigb regulon. clade a organisms have added a group of  <dig> genes  to the core regulon. the mechanism of addition of this gene cluster to the core sigb regulon almost exclusively rests on the assignment of sigb promoters to tus found in the common gene pool. this can most easily be seen in figure
 <dig>  as an almost exclusive assignment of either green blocks  or blue blocks . only occasionally does one observe an orthologous gene that is absent from a given genome . thus, hgt/indels appear to play only a minor role in the assembly of this gene cluster. clade a includes one member  that was isolated from the bloodstream of a pneumonia patient. although a second clade a strain, bc atcc <dig>  was originally isolated from a dairy product , this organism has been shown to cause experimental endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection
 <cit> . this intravitreal injection model mimics the course of disease associated with the entry of the organism into the interior of the eye following traumatic injury. however, this infection model likely by-passes the requirement for direct invasion strategies such as those employed by clade c/d organisms during anthrax or similarly aggressive disease. the remainder of clade a includes soil-borne organisms and one organism associated with food-borne intoxication. thus, clade a organisms may be pathogenic opportunists, in contrast to clades c/d organisms, which appear to be frank pathogens .

although clades c/d genomes encode cluster  <dig> genes, they are not functionally included in the sigb generalized stress response. instead, clades c/d have augmented the core sigb regulon with  <dig> genes from three different clusters . similar to gene cluster  <dig> in clade a, gene clusters 3a and 4a have been added to the core sigb regulon primarily by sigb promoter assignment from a common gene pool. by contrast, gene cluster 4b was added to the sigb regulon in clades c/d by a mixture of hgt/indels and promoter assignment ; most of these genes are not present in clades a and b .

clade a and cluster 5
cluster  <dig> includes a two-component regulator not orthologous to those included in clusters 3a/4a. this suggests that cluster  <dig> adds to the core regulon a regulatory cascade that extends further into the bc sensu lato transcriptome, and specific to clade a. this extension of the core sigb regulon would allow the stress response to be coordinated with the environmental signal to which this secondary regulator independently responds. gene cluster  <dig> also appears to coordinate the enhanced synthesis of cardiolipin , stimulated by at least three genes in this cluster, including cl synthase , and phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase and 3-ketoacyl- reductase . increased cl synthesis would change the composition of the cell membrane, increasing the hydrophobicity and viscosity of this membrane
 <cit> , which could have varied phenotypic effects. increased cl levels stimulate protein translocation across the cell membrane in b. subtilis <cit>  and e. coli <cit> , and are important for high osmolarity survival in b. subtilis <cit>  and s. aureus <cit> . high cl concentrations decrease cell envelope permeability, affecting nonspecific antibiotic resistance in e. coli <cit> , resistance to organic solvents
 <cit> , daptomycin resistance in s. aureus <cit>  and enterococcus faecalis <cit> , and resistance to antimicrobial peptides such as enterococcal as-48
 <cit>  and platelet microbicidal peptide tpmp-1
 <cit> . cl-rich domains in b. subtilis are preferentially distributed at the medial septa and the poles during exponential growth, and the polar septal membrane and the engulfment and forespore membranes during sporulation
 <cit> . b. subtilis spore membranes have a significantly higher cl content than membranes of exponentially growing cells, and cl appears to be essential to the proper functioning of germinant receptors
 <cit> .

due to the extensive divergence within abc transporter gene family, functional predictions may be difficult to substantiate by sequence similarity alone. nevertheless, the abc transporter genes included in tu# <dig> and tu# <dig> appear to be most similar to the abc a superfamily
 <cit> , typically responsible for export of hydrophobic compounds. prokaryotic members of this large gene family include the streptomyces peucetius <cit>  drrab exporter for hydrophobic compounds such as daunomycin and doxorubicin, and the b. licheniformis bcrabc bacitracin-resistance proteins
 <cit> . consequently, the abc transporters in cluster  <dig> may be efflux systems either responsible for cl export or working in concert with enhanced cl production to increase resistance to deleterious hydrophobic compounds or antimicrobial peptides.

cluster  <dig> tu # <dig> also includes the genes encoding reca and cina. in s. pneumoniae, the cina ortholog appears to direct reca to the membrane and enhance competency
 <cit> , although in b. subtilis, cina appears to be a nucleoid-associated protein
 <cit> . however, the most obvious consequence of enhanced reca expression is an increased likelihood of activation of the sos stress response by cleavage of lexa. in b. subtilis, at least  <dig> genes in  <dig> tus appear to be directly under reca/lexa control
 <cit> . if the bc sensu lato sos response is similar, this also would extend the sigb generalized stress response into a region of the clade a transcriptome to make these organisms more apt to express, among others, components of the excision, recombinational and error-prone repair pathways for dealing with dna damage. consequently, the collective inclusion of the genes in cluster  <dig> in the sigb-mediated stress response may fine-tune the stress response for competition with other microorganisms in a mixed microbial milieu. cluster  <dig> genes also may confer some advantage during pathogenesis, for example by increasing resistance to the bactericidal effects of neutrophil-induced dna damage or antimicrobial peptides.

clades c/d and clusters 3a, 4a and 4b
these clusters include the genes for three signal transduction histidine kinases, two of which are in tus with a  cognate response regulator . two additional transcriptional regulators and a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein also are included in these gene clusters. this suggests that an entirely different regulatory effector gene cascade extends the core sigb regulon in clade c/d organisms, presumably coordinating the sigb generalized stress response with different environmental signals than that of clade a organisms. note that the two cluster 4b regulatory proteins are unique to the genomes of invasive clade c/d organisms, suggesting that these genes likely control functions unique to the invasive phenotype. by contrast, the sigb-responsive regulators in clusters 3a/4a are part of the common gene pool shared with all genomes, although not included in the sigb regulon in those other organisms. this suggests that regulators found in clusters 3a/4a are important for supervising aspects of the common metabolism shared with other bc sensu lato organisms, but their inclusion in the generalized stress response is uniquely important for clades c/d organisms.

together, these gene clusters allow sigb to coordinate the expression of functions devoted to cell wall and spore structure and biosynthesis. cluster 3a encodes an ftsi ortholog, also known as pbp-2b
 <cit> , which appears to be recruited late to the division septum in b. subtilis <cit> . one of the cluster 4a regulatory proteins is the ortholog of the bacillus lytr protein, a member of the lytr-cpsa-psr gene family found in most members of the firmicutes
 <cit> . in b. subtilis, lytr lies in an operon with and controls expression of genes encoding the major autolytic amidase lytc, and a modifier gene lytb
 <cit> . in streptococcus pneumoniae, lytr is essential for normal septum formation
 <cit> , while the s. mutans lytr controls autolytic activity
 <cit> . the staphylococcus aureus lytr ortholog msrr plays a role in cell envelope maintenance, cell separation and virulence, and appears to be connected to the sara attenuation and virulence regulatory network
 <cit> . thus, inclusion of lytr in the clades c/d sigb regulons suggests that controlling cell wall-specific functions is important for supporting invasive disease.

cluster 4b includes an s-layer protein with three slh domains, previously designated as bsli by kern and schneewind
 <cit> . while no function has yet been ascribed to bsli, the genome of ba sterne encodes a suite of at least  <dig> s-layer proteins. eight other s-layer proteins are involved in peptidoglycan metabolism, with an additional seven important for virulence
 <cit> , suggesting that the function of the cell-surface s-layer protein bsli is similar.

cluster 4a also encodes udp-glucose 4-epimerase, which catalyzes the conversion of udp-glucose to udp-galactose
 <cit> . transcriptionally linked to this gene by sigb, cluster 3a includes a member of the gnat-transacetylase superfamily
 <cit> . some members of this superfamily use phosphoglucosamine as a substrate for transacetylation
 <cit> . collectively, these enzymes could collaborate to promote a burst in the synthesis of galactose-n-acetylglucosamine  during the stress response; this disaccharide is an important component of secondary cell wall polysaccharides found in ba and some virulent bc strains
 <cit> . additionally, galnac is an important linker molecule for tethering oligosaccharides to the collagen-like exosporium glycoprotein bcla
 <cit> , an immunodominant ba spore antigen
 <cit> .

cluster 3a encodes the gene for spore germination protein gerpf. in ba spores, impairment of gerpf expression causes a germination defect in response to nutrient germinants
 <cit> . this suggests that the sigb stress response in clades c/d organisms has been adjusted to ensure that a sufficient amount of gerpf is made for proper spore germination potential. targeting expression of gerpf via sigb does not appear necessary for clades a/b organisms; possibly gerpf is more important for the proper functioning of spores produced by invasive pathogens. for instance, this protein could be important for proper germination of spores within macrophages, an event that is associated with the ability of ba strains to cause disease
 <cit> . note also that some cluster 4a genes, while present in clade d organisms, are not included in the sigb regulon . this may suggest that the generalized stress response in clade d microbes is somewhat less capable of augmenting the pathogenic potential of these organisms, in contrast to clade c organisms, which include only virulent ba.

CONCLUSIONS
evolution of the sigb regulon and pathogenesis of the bc sensu lato group
this sample size is admittedly small, and so the generalizations leading to these hypotheses require further exploration. nevertheless, the hypotheses drawn from this heat map and cluster analyses are provocative. the simplest interpretation of the accumulated data  suggests that a clade b-like organism arose first from a b. cytotoxicus-like progenitor after receiving the sigb operon during an hgt event. following this, a nascent core sigb regulon was assembled by the addition of sigb promoters to tus from the b. cytotoxicus-like progenitor. other genes were added to the core regulon by a combination of hgt and gene duplication/divergence, both events accompanied by sigb promoter assignment. clade a and clades c/d organisms subsequently diverged from this common clade b-like organism by the addition of gene clusters  <dig> and 3a/4a/b, respectively, to the sigb core regulon. these additions occurred primarily by the assignment of sigb promoters to genes from a common gene pool, while the appearance of new genes, presumably by hgt or gene duplication, appears to be a much less common event. the tus augmenting the sigb regulon of clade a organisms may enhance the basal pathogenic potential of this clade, but may also make these organisms more capable of competing in the soil or other microbial consortia. clades c/d organisms are invasive pathogens; we hypothesize that the augmentation to the sigb core regulon in these organisms is important for supporting this phenotype. note also that some of the clade d organisms have been referred to as ‘anthrax-like’ bacteria
 <cit> , despite the tight clonality of the ba phylogeny that excludes these organisms. the close similarity of the sigb regulon of clade c and d organisms suggests a functional relationship between these two groups that may be important for their similar pathogenic potential.
