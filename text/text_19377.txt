BACKGROUND
molecular farming is the production of valuable pharmaceutical or industrial proteins in whole plants and plant-based systems such as cell suspension cultures  <cit> . inducible promoters are often used to restrict transgene expression to particular developmental stages in whole plants, or to particular growth phases in cultivated cells, because this can improve product quality and quantity. in cell suspension cultures, it is beneficial to produce secreted recombinant proteins during exponential growth because the beginning of the stationary phase is usually accompanied by the release of proteases that degrade secreted proteins  <cit> . ideally, bioprocess conditions that minimize proteolysis should be identified and transgene expression should be restricted to the most productive growth phase to prevent extensive protein degradation and loss of activity  <cit> . another important justification for the temporal restriction of transgene expression is the tendency for some proteins to inhibit growth and development of the host cells when expressed constitutively, thus reducing yields. for example, if the recombinant protein is an enzyme, its activity can alter cellular metabolism leading to severe pleiotropic effects  <cit>  or it can limit the amount of recombinant protein that the host can produce  <cit> . recombinant proteins can also physically interfere with host cellular components leading to highly detrimental or even lethal phenotypes  <cit> .

we recently reported the expression of the viral anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- <dig>  in transgenic tobacco plants, and found that retention of the recombinant protein in the endoplasmic reticulum  resulted in stunted plant growth, with the severity of the phenotype determined by the level of protein accumulation  <cit>  and additional file 1: figure s1]. subsequent transient expression experiments have shown that vil- <dig> is harmful to the plant not only when it is contained within the er, but also in the cytosol or following secretion to the apoplast, both of which led to rapid necrosis of the infiltrated leaf area . even plastid transformation, which is known to protect plants from the toxic effects of some recombinant proteins, produced transplastomic plants with a severe mutant phenotype and low levels of recombinant protein . we therefore decided to express vil- <dig> in the tobacco cell line bright yellow  <dig>  and to develop strategies based on temporally-restricted inducible expression to avoid the deleterious effects observed in planta.

conditional plant expression systems have been developed using elements from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters. most rely on chemical rather than physical induction, and the strategy employed is based either on transcriptional repression/activation or post-translational sequestration/release  <cit> . some of these systems have been applied successfully to plant suspension cultures  <cit> . we chose a tetracycline-inducible/derepressible system based on a modified cauliflower mosaic virus 35 s promoter , in which three operator sequences  from the escherichia coli tetracycline operon surround the tata box  <cit> . the teto sequences are recognized by the tetracycline repressor , but its specific binding activity is abolished in the presence of tetracycline or an analog such as doxycycline. in transgenic plants that express tetr constitutively, the triple op promoter can therefore be derepressed by supplying tetracycline or doxycycline  <cit> . this system has already been shown to regulate transgene expression precisely in by- <dig> cells, including genes encoding β-glucuronidase, green fluorescent protein and auxin binding protein  <dig>  <cit> .

we have developed an improved tetracycline-inducible system that is easy to handle, produces high yields of recombinant protein and that includes a constitutively-expressed visible marker allowing the best-performing clones to be selected rapidly. stable transformation of by- <dig> cells with this vector resulted in the production of  <dig> -fold higher levels of vil- <dig> compared to constitutive expression in the same host.

RESULTS
constitutive expression of murine and viral il- <dig> in by- <dig> cells
by- <dig> suspension cell lines constitutively expressing viral interleukin  <dig>  were produced by transforming wild-type cells with construct ptrakt_er-vil- <dig>  which encodes an er-targeted version of the protein under the transcriptional control of the double enhanced camv 35 s promoter  <cit> . although transgenic tobacco plants expressing this construct were stunted, those expressing an er-targeted version of murine il- <dig> did not show an obvious morphological phenotype  <cit> . we therefore produced by- <dig> lines constitutively expressing murine il- <dig> as a control. these lines were generated by transforming wild-type cells with construct ptrakt_er-mil- <dig>  which is directly analogous to ptrakt_er-vil- <dig> and contains the same regulatory elements.

we screened  <dig> independent transgenic callus clones for each construct by immunodotblot analysis to identify the seven best-performing lines. these were tested by elisa to determine the precise levels of il- <dig>  and the best performing clone for each construct was used to establish liquid suspension cell cultures. we used the same elisa to determine the levels of il- <dig> in cell pellets from each culture prepared  <dig>   <dig> and 7 days after subculture into fresh medium . the highest yields were observed  <dig> dps in both lines:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g fresh weight  for mil- <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/g fw for vil- <dig> . less than  <dig> % of each protein was detected in the culture supernatant, as expected for a protein targeted for retention in the er. the recombinant proteins were of the correct size and mil- <dig> was glycosylated as expected . there was no significant difference in the growth properties of the cell suspension cultures based on pellet weight, but it was clear that vil- <dig> was produced at much lower levels than mil- <dig>  we proposed that vil- <dig> was toxic to plant cells, based on its effect on transgenic plants, and that this toxicity had prevented the recovery of high-yielding transgenic by- <dig> lines. we therefore investigated the temporal restriction of vil- <dig> production using a tetracycline-inducible promoter.

generation of a by-2-tetr line
the strict regulation of transgene expression using a tetracycline inducible promoter requires the generation of a stable cell line expressing high levels of tetr. we therefore transformed wild-type by- <dig> cells with pbintetr  <cit> , containing the tetr gene under the control of the camv 35 s promoter. transformants were selected on medium supplemented with kanamycin and  <dig> independent callus clones were screened for tetr mrna by northern blot analysis . clones # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> were used to establish liquid suspension cultures, all three of which grew well. we chose clone # <dig> for super-transformation with our inducible vil- <dig> constructs and this cell line was named by-2-tetr.

development of an optimized vector for tetracycline-inducible transgene expression
we initially introduced the sequence for the er-targeted version of vil- <dig> into pbinhygtx  <cit>  to create pbinhygtx_vil- <dig> . this was used to super-transform the by-2-tetr cell line but even by this stage we were aware that the chosen vector system was suboptimal, in that the large size of pbinhygtx  made subcloning procedures unnecessarily complicated. the preliminary induction of transgene expression in transformed callus clones was also more complex than anticipated because the induction of by- <dig> cells with anhydrotetracycline  on solid medium as described  <cit>  was not uniform, giving rise to heterogeneous vil- <dig> yields as determined by immunodotblot or elisa at each repetition . we also tried an alternative strategy of inducing vil- <dig> expression while the callus was in liquid medium directly after resuspension, but the addition of ahtc resulted in extensive cell death, probably due the higher toxicity of the chemical on the already stressed cells.

we therefore decided to construct a vector carrying a tandem expression cassette comprising the tetracycline-inducible vil- <dig> gene and the discosoma spp. red fluorescent protein  gene under the control of the constitutive camv 35 s promoter. the visible marker gene was included to facilitate the early selection of the best-performing clones based on fluorescence intensity, which correlates with the amount of protein  <cit> . we switched to the ptra vector series  because they have a smaller backbone than pbin vectors  and are therefore more suitable for tandem expression cassettes. expression cassettes in the ptra vector used are also flanked by scaffold attachment regions  from the tobacco rb <dig> gene  <cit> , and include the tobacco etch virus 5′-utr which promotes protein synthesis  <cit> . to maximize the expression of vil- <dig> we generated a tetracycline-inducible camv 35 s promoter including an enhancer sequence. the final vector was named ptrah_dsred-etxvil- <dig> .

vector/promoter comparison
we tested the potential of the enhanced tetracycline-inducible camv 35 s promoter in ptrah_dsred-etxvil- <dig> by transient expression in tobacco plants, using a control vector lacking the teto sequences. wild-type tobacco plants  were individually syringe-infiltrated with agrobacterium tumefaciens strains carrying one of the four different vectors available for vil- <dig> expression . wild-type tobacco plants do not produce tetr, so transcription from all the promoters  was constitutive, allowing the direct comparison of their efficiency. agroinfiltration was carried out in such a way as to include all possible variations in vil- <dig> expression due to the state of the plant/leaf material . we prepared leaf discs from the infiltrated areas of all three leaves from both plants at each time point, and pooled the samples for protein extraction and vil- <dig> quantification by elisa . we assumed that the onset of necrosis in the tissue infiltrated with ptra_e35stx at  <dig> dpi represented high levels of recombinant protein expression  even though detected vil- <dig> in the necrotic tissue was lower due to high levels of proteolytic activity and inefficient protein extraction. we were thus able to rank the promoters/vector combinations in descending order of activity as follows: ptra_e35stx ≥ ptra_35stx > > pbin_35stx . the comparison of ptra_35stx and ptra_e35stx indicated that the additional enhancer sequence in ptra_e35stx has a significant impact on recombinant protein accumulation, resulting in the appearance of necrotic lesions in the infiltrated area by 6 days post-infiltration. the pbin_35tx vector was an order of magnitude less efficient than any of the vectors based on ptra.

selection of the best transgenic lines
the by-2-tetr line was super-transformed with ptrahdsred-etxvil- <dig> and over a hundred independent callus clones were derived by double selection on medium containing kanamycin and hygromycin. we then selected the callus clones displaying macroscopically uniform dsred fluorescence because this is usually a good indicator of the expression levels of a linked transgene . nine callus clones representing low  medium  and high  levels of dsred fluorescence were identified by eye and transferred directly into liquid medium to establish suspension cell cultures .

as for the best two lines induction 3 days after subculture resulted in overall lower vil- <dig> yields compared to induction directly at the time of subculture , we then tested for correspondence between dsred fluorescence intensity and vil- <dig> yields by inducing all cell lines with 10 μm ahtc at the next subculture interval. the amount of vil- <dig> in cell pellet extracts was determined by elisa at  <dig>   <dig> and 7 days post-induction  . the yield of the recombinant protein increased over time, with the highest levels of vil- <dig> detected  <dig> dpi for all lines. a similar trend in protein accumulation was observed for the constitutive expression of the same transgenes in newly-established suspension cultures whose growth in liquid medium had not been completely stabilized . in addition to the preliminary visual evaluation of dsred levels in the transgenic callus clones, we quantified the levels of dsred protein in extracts from the callus clones and the derived cell suspension cultures . there was excellent correspondence between the visual evaluations and accurately-determined protein levels in all cases. the amount of dsred in the callus clones was generally slightly higher than in the corresponding suspension cells. as expected, there was also a good correlation between the amount of vil- <dig> measured at  <dig> dpi and the level of dsred fluorescence in the same clones . line # <dig> produced the highest yields of vil- <dig> and was evaluated by elisa in three independent induction experiments, sampling the culture daily from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi . the results were reproducible, with vil- <dig> yields of up to  <dig>  μg/g fw by  <dig> dpi, which is more than  <dig>  times higher than the best-performing constitutive lines . negligible amounts of vil- <dig> were found in the non-induced control cultures of even the best-performing transgenic lines , indicating that the by-2-tetr cassette is tightly regulated and does not show significant leakiness.

impact of ahtc on cell growth
the growth of the transgenic lines with the highest vil- <dig> levels post-induction  was monitored under both the induced and non-induced states alongside wild-type by- <dig> cells, and the biomass was determined at different intervals. as shown in figure 7a,b, the growth curves of both transgenic lines are similar in the presence and absence of ahtc, indicating that neither the inducer nor the accumulation of vil- <dig> had a significant impact on cell growth during the investigated timeframe. in contrast, the addition of ahtc to the wild-type cells reduced their growth significantly . in the transgenic lines, binding of the tetr protein to free ahtc probably prevents its toxic effect  <cit> .

discussion
plant cell suspension cultures are emerging as a useful platform for the manufacture of recombinant proteins  <cit> . production lines can be generated and scaled up more quickly and with lower costs than systems based on whole plants  <cit> . plant cells are also advantageous because recombinant proteins can be secreted into and recovered from the culture medium. they allow pharmaceuticals to be produced under current good manufacturing practice in bioreactor-based processes. efficient and reliable inducible expression systems can improve the versatility of plant cell cultures still further by restricting protein expression to the most productive growth phase and preventing exposure to proteases which reduce both the quantity and the quality of the product. inducible promoters allow transgene expression to be delayed until the culture has reached a suitable biomass in the late exponential growth phase, allowing production to be uncoupled from plant cell growth  <cit> .

tetracycline-specific derepressible expression  <cit>  is a widely-characterized inducible system in plants that has been successfully applied in tobacco by- <dig> cells  <cit> . we have developed an improved version using a tandem construct incorporating a constitutive visual marker gene that allows the rapid and straightforward selection of the best-performing transgenic lines.

the first improvement was achieved by transferring the expression cassette from a pbin vector to ptra, resulting in a substantial increase in recombinant protein yields by transient expression in tobacco. this probably reflects the influence of the tobacco etch virus 5′-utr, which acts as a translational enhancer in plants  <cit> . the ptra vector also contains flanking scaffold attachment regions , which are known to enhance transcriptional activity and mitigate silencing effects by defining a stable chromatin domain  <cit> . although stable transgenic lines were not generated with the pbin vector, transient expression experiments usually provide a reliable indication of the outcome of stable transformation  <cit> , thus it is reasonable to anticipate superior performance from the ptra vector in stable transgenic lines.

the second improvement was achieved by adding a camv 35 s enhancer upstream of the tetracycline-inducible triple-op promoter. the presence of the enhancer sequence significantly increases the activity of the native camv 35 s promoter  <cit> . we anticipated similar benefits in the context of the triple-op promoter because it differs from the native promoter only in the presence of three teto sequences surrounding the tata box, and their presence should not hamper the synergistic interaction between the enhancer and minimal promoter.

the third and most innovative improvement was the tandem configuration of the inducible transgene and a constitutive visual marker gene, which greatly simplified the procedure for selecting the best-performing clones. transgene expression is strongly influenced by the chromatin surrounding the integration site so tightly linked transgenes are generally subjected to the same global regulatory factors. this means that a gene encoding a fluorescent protein can be used as a surrogate marker to determine the activity of a linked transgene whose product can only be detected using as less convenient off-line assay. in this case, we found that the intensity of dsred fluorescence was proportional to the amount of dsred protein, which in turn was indicative of the amount of vil- <dig>  although we observed a good correlation between the marker and the primary gene product, many factors could uncouple the yields of adjacent transgenes such as multiple or partial t-dna insertions and transgene rearrangements. the dsred gene was placed adjacent to the right-hand t-dna border in our vector, and since the right-hand border is transferred first this configuration is more likely to produce false positives  than false negatives . even so, the advantage of initial screening based solely on dsred fluorescence is that second-stage screening following induction of the linked transgene is limited to a handful of promising clones, rather than tens or hundreds  <cit> . should it be so desired, it is also still possible within our platform to analyze antibiotic resistant callus clones that lack dsred fluorescence to identify potential false negative lines that produce high levels of vil- <dig>  we used a precise fluorometric assay to determine the levels of dsred fluorescence in order to carry out a quantitative comparison between dsred and vil- <dig> expression and demonstrate the predictive accuracy of our platform. however, for routine deployment such a precise assay is unnecessary. the human eye cannot distinguish small variations in fluorescence but is sufficient to identify the brightest callus clones on a plate using a green fluorescent light and a red filter, allowing the rapid visual selection of promising clones without sophisticated apparatus.

finally, the constitutively expressed visual marker can also be used as an internal control to monitor the genetic stability of selected transgenic lines during prolonged cultivation with multiple subcultures. any loss of fluorescence would be a strong indicator of transgene disruption/loss by recombination or the onset of epigenetic gene silencing.

the combination of improvements discussed above resulted in a highly reproducible increase in the accumulation of vil- <dig>   <dig>  times higher than those obtained by constitutive expression in the same cell line. the inducible expression cassette was highly efficient, benefiting from a low basal expression level and a high induction ratio. we did not replenish ahtc in the culture medium so vil- <dig> accumulation peaked at  <dig> dpi in well-established suspension cultures and decreased thereafter . further increases in yield might be achieved by optimizing the concentration and dosing method of the inducer and the timing of induction.

as well as its value in the field of molecular farming, the inducible expression cassette could also be useful for basic research by allowing the precisely-regulated overexpression or silencing of endogenous genes  <cit> . the accurate measurement of reporter protein fluorescence would allow the selection of cell lines with different levels of transgene expression, allowing quantitative effects to be monitored rather than the binary on/off choice that conventional assays allow. in that regard, dsred has been used as reporter gene in by- <dig> cells  <cit> , whole plants  <cit> , fungi  <cit>  and animals  <cit>  without any reports of adverse effects on the host.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a more efficient and more convenient version of the widely used tetracycline-inducible expression system, and have used it to increase the accumulation of the toxic cytokine vil- <dig> in by- <dig> cell suspension cultures. the new platform increases both the quality and the quantity of the final product, and allows the high-level production of recombinant proteins that would affect the growth and vitality of cells when expressed constitutively. although we demonstrated the platform using by- <dig> cells to produce vil- <dig>  the components can be transferred easily to any other host cell, allowing the platform to be used both for molecular farming and basic research.
