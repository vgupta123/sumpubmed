BACKGROUND
half-smooth tongue sole  is a large flatfish species naturally distributes in east asia  <cit> . this species has been considered as one of the most flavored species, which shows special advantages in a mild taste. owing to limited wild resources, this flatfish has become an important farmed fish in china  <cit> . studies on this valuable aquatic fish have focused on the development of genetic markers, construction of genetic maps, and characterization of functional genes involved in growth, reproduction, stress, and immunity . recently, whole genome sequencing of c. semilaevis has been completed which made the study of species into a new phase  <cit> .

advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated the studies on the genome and transcriptome of a non-model organism, such as c. semilaevis. massively parallel  <dig> pyrosequencing, which shows its long-read characteristics , can be performed for de novo transcriptome analysis  <cit> . using  <dig> pyrosequencing, researchers sequenced and characterized the transcriptomes of many species .

the present study aimed to characterize the transcriptome of c. semilaevis. a multi-tissue and multi-individual library was constructed and sequenced using a  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. sequence assembly, gene annotation, transposable element  analysis, and marker identification were performed.

RESULTS
sequence analysis and assembly
a mixed sample of cdnas obtained from ten tissues, including brain, gill, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, intestine, muscle, testis, and ovary, was prepared and sequenced using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform in one full picotiter plate. this sequencing run produced  <dig>  raw reads with an average length of 235 bp . after adapters, short, and low-quality sequences were removed, we obtained  <dig>  high-quality sequence reads with an average length of 206 bp. these results showed that  <dig> % of the raw reads contained useful sequence data, which could be used for subsequent assembly. as a result,  <dig> % of the clean reads ranged between  <dig> and 500 bp in length .table  <dig>

the assembly of the trimmed and size-selected reads produced  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the length of the contigs ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp with an average length of  <dig> bp and an n <dig> of  <dig> bp . the average sequencing coverage, which was determined as the number of reads assembled into a particular contig, was  <dig> . a positive relationship between the length of a specific contig and its coverage was observed in a randomly fragmented transcriptome   <cit> . using cd-hit  <cit> , we performed cluster analysis with a standard such that the sequences with a similarity to this transcriptome of >95% were clustered into one class; the longest sequence of each class was used as a representative sequence. a total of  <dig>  representative sequences, which may be unigenes, were obtained.

the complete genome sequence of c. semilaevis has been obtained, in which a 477 m genome with a scaffold n <dig> size of 867 kb was assembled  <cit> . to assess our trancriptome assembly, we mapped the unigenes to c. semilaevis genome. approximately  <dig> % of unigenes exhibited significant hits on the genome. the mapping rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for isotigs and singletons, respectively. a high mapping rate indicated that our established assembly was assembly.

the result of assembly of our data was compared to other fish transcriptome by  <dig> pyrosequencing   <cit> . the average length of raw reads of the four fish transcriptomes was not as long as the desired length of the technique. this result suggested that the procedures used to construct genome libraries should be improved. moreover, the average length of c. semilaevis contigs was shorter than that of the three other fishes. this result may be attributed to the following reasons. i) in sequence depth, oncorhynchus mykiss and poecilia reticulate, which sequenced more reads, oncorhynchus mykiss and poecilia reticulate produced longer contigs than c. semilaevis. ii) in the presence of alternative splicing regions, the assembly of long sequences may be impeded  <cit> .table  <dig>

annotation
several complementary approaches were used to annotate the assembled sequences. the unigenes were initially compared with those in public protein databases by using blastx  <cit> . with this procedure, the gene names of  <dig>   sequences were successfully assigned . a low annotation rate was mainly attributed to a short unigene because the significance of the blast comparison partially depends on the length of query sequence; thus, short reads obtained from sequencing rarely match known genes  <cit> . in the present study, the annotation rate of short sequences  was lower than that of long sequences . another reason accounted for low assignment percentage was the lack of information regarding flatfish. for example, only  <dig> sequences accounting for  <dig> % of the total annotated sequences were annotated using the known information on flatfish. the three species with the most hits to pleuronectiformes were paralichthys olivaceus , c. semilaevis , and solea senegalensis .

the unigenes with matches in public protein databases were annotated with gene ontology  annotation, which provides a dynamically controlled vocabulary and hierarchical relationships to represent information regarding molecular function, cellular component, and biological process  <cit> . among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were annotated with  <dig>  go terms . we also found the following records:  <dig>  annotated with a cellular component ;  <dig>  annotated with a molecular function ; and  <dig>  annotated with a biological process . in cellular component, genes involved in cell  and cell part  were the most abundant . in molecular functions, binding  and catalytic activities  dominated the go terms . in biological process, the most abundant categories were cellular  and metabolic  processes .figure  <dig>

the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway approach used to perform high-order functional annotation was implemented using the web tool kass  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were mapped to  <dig> different pathways . among these pathways, the three highest maps were metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , and microbial metabolism in diverse environments .

functional genes involved in growth and immunity
as a valuable aquaculture fish, half-smooth tongue sole exhibits economical traits that are of great importance to aquaculturists. the sequences obtained by pyrosequencing and the annotation information provided significant data to determine economically important traits, including growth, reproduction, stress, and immunity.

the transcripts responsible for growth  were identified in our dataset. seven sequences were identified as growth-related hormones. among these seven sequences, three correspond to growth hormone-inducible transmembrane proteins, two correspond to growth hormone receptor  <dig>  one corresponds to a predicted potassium channel subfamily k member, and the remaining sequence corresponds to a growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor.

mhc, a group of genes that encode for major histocompatibility antigens, functions in the immune response of vertebrates. approximately  <dig> sequences have been annotated as mhc genes  <cit> . this finding is consistent with that of the variability of mhc genes.

cytochrome p <dig>  is a part of a large family of heme enzymes that catalyze diverse chemical reactions, including epoxidation, hydroxylation, and heteroatom oxidation  <cit> . steroidogenic enzyme is a member of the family p <dig> aromatase ; this enzyme is responsible for the conversion of androgen to estrogen and suppression of p <dig> arom gene expression; as a result, phenotypic sex reversal in fish occurs  <cit> . the gender ratio of the cultivated half-smooth tongue sole was not 1: <dig> because the number of males was higher than that of the females. we identified  <dig> sequences annotated as p450; go terms and kegg pathways of these sequences were also detected.

transposable elements identification
tes can be divided into two general classes  <cit> : class i or retroelements are transposed via an rna intermediate and class ii or dna transposons can directly manipulate dna to propagate themselves into another site within a genome  <cit> . a search on our transcriptome data revealed that  <dig>  sequences contained putative tes; among these tes,  <dig> and  <dig> belonged to retroelements and dna transposons, respectively . the most common retroelements were gypsy , jockey , and copia ; the most common dna transposons were cacta , hat , and tc1-mariner .figure  <dig>

previous studies reported that tes are involved in the formation of the sex chromosomes of fish . c. semilaevis contains a pair of well-differentiated sex chromosomes, and a large w chromosome is easily recognizable  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which the w chromosome is formed in c. semilaevis remains unclear. in another study , c. semilaevis contains a large number of tes accumulated in the heterochromatic regions of the w chromosome. our data sets are important to understand this phenomenon.

ssr and snp discovery
a total of  <dig>  ssrs located in  <dig>  sequences were identified in our  <dig> pyrosequencing data set. the most common repeat motifs were dinucleotides, which accounted for  <dig> % of the total ssrs; other repeat motifs were trinucleotides , tetranucleotides , pentanucleotides , and hexanucleotides . on the basis of the distribution of ssr motifs, we found that ac motifs were the most common ; cag and aaac repeat motifs were the most abundant motifs in tri- and tetra-nucleotides, respectively.

molecular markers should be developed to facilitate marker-assisted selection to optimize commercial species and improve the available genetic resources of species. transcriptome sequencing is a rapid and effective method to identify ssr and snp markers. these markers identified by transcriptome sequencing are possibly associated with specific traits. in our trancriptome sequencing,  <dig>  ssrs were identified, but the effectiveness should be validated. previous studies may provide references for validation. for instance, gao et al. identified  <dig>  putative ssrs in the transcriptome of blunt snout bream  by  <dig> pyrosequencing, and  <dig> of  <dig>  ssrs have been validated by pcr. in addition,  <dig>  of these ssrs were polymorphic across a panel of  <dig> individuals. the c. semilaevis transcriptomes in this study and our study showed that dinucleotide repeats accounted for the highest proportions . however, the proportion of dinucleotide repeats is higher  in clupea harengus transcriptome  <cit> ; this result indicated that dinucleotide repeats are the most common ssr type.

pcr and sequencing errors resulted in false positives to detect snp. we implemented strict criteria to reduce the effects of sequencing errors. these criteria were listed as follows:  q value of the bases was restricted at <23;  minor allele frequency was >15%; and  the minimum number of minor allele reads was set at  <dig>  hence, a total of  <dig>  putative snps and  <dig>  putative single-nucleotide indels were identified. these putative snps included  <dig>  transitions and  <dig>  transversions. the overall frequency of all of the snp types and indels in the transcriptome was  <dig> per 491 bp.

false positive should be considered when snp is detected by high-throughput sequencing technology. the number of identified snps and the false-positive rate were directly affected by the criteria used to identify snp. numerous snps are usually obtained when low parameter settings are used, resulting in a low positive rate. in a previous study,  <dig>  putative snps and  <dig>  indels are detected in m. amblycephala  <cit>  without considering the minor allele frequency; after a minimum minor allele frequency was set at >15%, the numbers decreased to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these results are similar to those in our study. we also examined the changes in the number of putative snps and indels when different numbers of minimal minor allele reads were applied. the number of putative snps and indels decreased, whereas the number of minor allele reads increased . moreover, the snp false-positive rate decreased and the snps were more prevalent in the half-smooth tongue sole populations than in other species. therefore, the snps with high numbers of supported reads should be selected when snp marker development is performed.table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we performed the de novo transcriptome sequencing of half-smooth tongue sole  by using a  <dig> flx titanium platform. our results revealed a large number of candidate genes potentially involved in growth, reproduction, and stress/immunity response. putative tes were detected and analyzed. moreover, numerous snps and ssrs were identified and prepared to perform marker development. our data set provided a useful resource for future genetic or genomic studies on this species.
