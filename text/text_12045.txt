BACKGROUND
the ability to modulate development in the presence of predators is referred as "inducible defense" or "predator-induced polyphenism"  <cit> . of the examples reported to date, the freshwater microcrustacean genus daphnia, commonly called the waterflea, is considered to be a model case for elucidating the ecological and developmental underpinnings of this process  <cit> . d. pulex produces structures referred to as neckteeth on its head, primarily in the earlier instars , in the presence of predatory phantom midges  . it is considered that this morphological change in daphnids occurs in response to being exposed to chemical cues referred to as "kairomones" released by predators  <cit> . neckteeth effectively decrease the risk of predation because it is difficult for predators to capture daphnia juveniles that have this outgrowth  <cit> . several investigations have shown that d. pulex exhibits sensitivity to chaoborus kairomones during embryonic development  <cit> . in addition, the additive effects of these chemical cues and sensitive phases of d. pulex embryos and juveniles have been elucidated  <cit> .

predator-induced defenses most commonly involve morphological and behavioral changes, which allow them to escape from predators efficiently and contribute positively toward the overall ecological success of daphnia  <cit> . the morphological changes in daphnia that occur in response to the existence of predators are considered to be among the most remarkable examples of polyphenism, particularly since individuals with the same genetic background can express a variety of phenotypes in response to different environmental cues. during postembryonic development, neckteeth have been observed in the first instar, although the rate of induction in this instar is generally weak  <cit> . induction rates were generally stronger in the second and third instars, before becoming weaker again in the fourth instar; neckteeth have not been reported in daphnia after the fifth instar  <cit> . it is thought that daphnia are most sensitive to kairomone signals during embryonic development  <cit> , but exposure to the chemical cues after the first-instar juvenile stage is also required for the maintenance of these structures  <cit> . the morphogenesis of neckteeth appears to start during embryogenesis  <cit> . although the developmental mechanisms by which multiple alternative phenotypes are produced have attracted considerable interest  <cit> , little is known about the molecular basis underlying the developmental regulation of defense morph formation.

the waterflea daphnia has come to be widely used as a model animal for a variety of reasons  <cit> . specifically, since daphnia is a keystone species in ponds and lakes  <cit> , it has been used for decades as a standard organism for toxicity testing and its toxicological responses to environmental pollutants are well characterized  <cit> . furthermore, daphnia pulex is the first crustacean to have had its genome sequenced  <cit> , and these new genomic data are likely to facilitate studies in the wide variety of research disciplines that employ daphnia . indeed, the availability of the draft daphnia pulex genome sequence assembly and annotation v <dig>  promotes the development of a new model system for ecological and evolutionary genomics  <cit> .

in this study, several experiments using molecular tools were designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying defense morph formation in response to predator kairomones. our previous study, which established the defense-morph induction by the exposure of dissected embryos to kairomone, revealed that kairomone reception during the late-embryonic stage  is required for the future development of neckteeth, although the defensive traits only appear in postembryonic instars, particularly the second- and third-instars   <cit> . these findings suggest that, downstream of kairomone reception, the mechanisms responsible for fate determination and neckteeth development are activated in stage- <dig> embryos and first-instar juveniles, respectively . in daphnia, kairomone reception is thought to initiate a series of biological reactions; neuronal signals which are converted into endocrine signals that then subsequently induce changes in the expressions of morphogenetic factors and result in defense morph formation. the occurrence of these reactions has been inferred by recent studies on polyphenic development in insects  <cit> . based on this working hypothesis, we searched the daphnia genome database  for genes affecting endocrine, morphogenetic and neuronal regulations, which are considered to be involved in the defense-morph formation. then, using real-time quantitative rt-pcr, we sought to determine whether the observed mrna expression levels of these gene sequences changed in response to kairomone treatment in stage- <dig> embryos and the first-instar juveniles. furthermore, to identify any unknown genes involved in these processes, we also screened genes that had been differentially expressed in response to kairomone exposure using a differential display method . based on these results, the functions of these genes are discussed in terms of kairomone reception and defense morph formation.

RESULTS
selection of candidate genes
in d. pulex defense morph formation, it is thought that morphogenetic factors such as those that have been identified in many arthropods are expressed downstream of physiological regulation  <cit> . the following  <dig> candidate genes were identified in the d. pulex genome: hox genes , morphogenetic genes , endocrine genes  and neuronal genes . blastx searches http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi confirmed that the predicted d. pulex sequences are homologues of the candidate genes .

expression profiles of candidate genes
the relative expression levels of the candidate genes were quantified using real-time quantitative rt-pcr to examine whether these genes were differentially expressed after exposure to the predator kairomone in the embryonic stage  and the postembryonic instar . 18s ribosomal rna, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  genes were tested as reference genes for real-time qpcr. since gapdh was considered to be the most stable gene and its expression levels were closest to those of the candidate genes , gapdh was used as the reference gene. this result was consistent with a previous report of expression stability in d. magna following exposure to the drug, ibuprofen  <cit> .

real-time qpcr revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> candidate genes were up-regulated in the presence of kairomones in first-instar juveniles. conversely, none of the candidate genes were up-regulated by more than  <dig> -fold at the embryonic stage  <dig> . two genes  were not amplified by pcr, probably because the designed primer sites were inappropriate. since a number of traits in first-instar juveniles change in response to defense morph formation , the candidate genes were thought to be up-regulated in the preceding developmental stage , although the expected results were not obtained. it is therefore suggested that the up-regulated genes are involved in neckteeth development, which is most pronounced at the second- and third-instar  <cit> . furthermore, these results show that the candidate gene approach using a daphnia genome database can be used for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the defense morph formation.

to further clarify differences in the expression of the six candidate genes showing the most marked up-regulation  and the two gene candidates thought to be associated with jhamt  and inr , we reperformed the real-time qpcr using biological replicates to analyze the detailed expression profiles of kairomone-responsive genes whose functions were suspected of being involved in defense morph formation . unfortunately, since the level of expression of tbm varied between trials , we excluded tbm from further analyses.

endocrine genes 
compared to when no kairomones were present, the expression levels of jhamt, met, inr and irs- <dig> in first-instar juveniles exposed to kairomones increased by approximately  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively . jhamt encodes the methyltransferase that mediates the final step of juvenile hormone synthesis  <cit> , met encodes a candidate receptor for juvenile hormone  <cit> , inr encodes an insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor, and irs- <dig> encodes a downstream element that interacts directly with inr  <cit> .

in addition to polyphenism  <cit> , juvenile hormones  constitute a group of acyclic sesquiterpenoids that are key hormones in the regulation of a variety of physiological regulations in insect development and morphogenesis  <cit> . in crustaceans, methyl farnesoate  is known to act as a juvenile hormone and plays important roles in the regulation of development  <cit> . for example, male production can be induced in female daphnids treated with mf  <cit> ; however, little is known about other functions of mf in d. pulex. in addition to jh, the insulin-signaling pathway in many animals is also important for the regulation of a variety of developmental processes, including body-size and allometry controls  <cit> . it has been suggested that the crosstalk between the jh and insulin-signaling pathways is responsible for the expression of morphogenetic factors in the development of beetle horns  <cit> . thus, it appears that physiological regulation by these endocrine factors may induce the expression of morphogenetic genes resulting in neckteeth formation in d. pulex.

morphogenetic genes 
compared to conditions without kairomones, the expression levels of hox <dig>  extradenticle and escargot in first-instar juveniles increased by approximately  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, in the presence of kairomones . hox <dig> is a member of the hox cluster and appears to have a typical hox-like role in the centipede, whereas the insect hox <dig> ortholog, zerknüllt , has lost the function of specifying segmental identity during embryogenesis  <cit> . although little is known about the functions of crustacean hox <dig>  expression in d. pulex has been reported in the nuchal area  and in the mandibular mesoderm during the early- and mid-embryonic stages, respectively  <cit> , suggesting a possible role in establishing the position of neckteeth development. furthermore, although daphnia neckteeth cannot be considered to be homologous to appendages, it is possible that the molecular mechanisms for appendage development are co-opted for neckteeth development.

exd and esg respectively encode a homeobox transcription factor and a zinc finger transcription factor, and both are known to determine the proximal segmental identity of appendages  in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . furthermore, up-regulation of dac, a known selector gene for the femur and tibia in d. melanogaster, and dll, which defines tarsus and pretarsus, did not produce as conspicuous a response as exd and esg in first-instar juveniles  . this evidence showed that the genes responsible for the determination of proximal appendages were up-regulated in juveniles with neckteeth, implies that these genes might be co-opted for neckteeth formation. however, our results also showed that the expression level of al, a known selector gene for the most distal region of appendage  <cit> , was also higher . this is probably because, in drosophila, al is also expressed in the proximal regions of appendages  <cit> . it has recently been reported that dll and al are both involved in the development of beetle horns, which are not homologous to appendages  <cit> . this is similar to the situation in the daphnia neckteeth formation, except that the co-opted regions of appendages are different . indeed, further analyses of this hypothesis will provide us with insights, not only into defense morph formation in daphnia, but also into the evolution of appendage morphology in arthropods.

exploring novel genes by differential display
next, differential display was performed to identify any novel genes that were related to neckteeth formation, but which were not included in the candidate gene approach. as a result, we obtained  <dig> fragments exhibiting differential expressions in response to kairomone exposure. to refine these results further, blastn searches were used to compare these fragments against wfleabase and their coding sequences were predicted using a gene prediction software joined to wfleabase . for the single fragment for which the functional sequence could not be predicted by the gene predictor, the full sequence was determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends -pcr. of these  <dig> sequences, we performed real-time quantitative rt-pcr to confirm their responsiveness as described for the candidate genes above. as a result, three genes  showed marked up-regulation in response to kairomone exposure .

a expression levels in the presence of the kairomones are displayed relative to control medium, measured by first real-time quantitative pcr. values in bold indicate more than  <dig> -fold increase.

dd1
in stage  <dig> embryos, dd <dig> expression was up-regulated approximately  <dig> -fold after exposure to kairomones ; among all the genes examined in this study, this was the only gene that responded to kairomones in the embryonic stage. blast searches suggested that there were no genes homologous to dd <dig> in other crustaceans and insects. motif searches using the interpro database http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/interproscan/ revealed that dd <dig> has a signal peptide and a dopamine beta-monooxygenase n-terminal  domain. domon domains are ubiquitous among plants and animals, and exist in a variety of proteins, including dopamine beta-monooxygenase, in which this domain was originally found  <cit> . in d. pulex, dd <dig> is thus considered to be a novel gene containing a domon domain. in addition to the aforementioned dopamine beta-monooxygenase , representative proteins containing a domon domain also include tyramine beta-monooxygenase , which is involved in the biosynthesis of biogenic amines  <cit> . however, the sequence and the domain structure of dd <dig> were completely different to those of dbm and tbm , and the expression profiles of dd <dig> also did not correspond to those of dbm and tbm . consequently, dd <dig> is considered to play a different role than either dbm or tbm. it is possible that dd <dig> is involved in kairmone reception and/or fate determination in the defense morph, because dd <dig> expression was initiated by the presence of kairomones at embryonic stage  <dig>  which is considered to be a critical period for the reception of kairomones  <cit> , before declining over the course of postembryonic development .

dd <dig>  dd3
in postembryonic first-instars, expression levels of dd <dig> and dd <dig> in the presence of kairomones increased by approximately 3- and 2-fold, respectively . while dd <dig> showed extremely high homology to bacterial ribosomal rna , the dd <dig> sequence in the d. pulex genome database was found to contain introns. furthermore, the full dd <dig> sequence obtained by race-pcr had a 3' poly tail, which is not typically present in bacterial transcripts and suggests that the identification of dd <dig> was not the result of contamination. interestingly, in addition to kairomone responsiveness, the expression levels of dd <dig> were more than 100-fold higher in the first-instar juveniles than in the embryos . based on these findings, it is possible that dd <dig> may have been acquired by horizontal transfer from bacteria.

dd <dig> exhibited similarity to growth and transformation-dependent protein  . although gtd-p homologues have been identified in some arthropod species, little is known about its functions. however, it was reported that gtd-p was strongly expressed when a rat pheochromocytoma cell line  was exposed to nerve growth factor   <cit> . as it was reported that pc <dig> cells exposed to ngf undergo proliferation, it is possible that gtd-p is involved in the cellular proliferation observed during defense morph formation in d. pulex.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we compared the gene expression profiles in the presence/absence of predator kairomones in d. pulex embryos and first-instar juveniles. most of the differences in gene expression induced by the kairomone exposure were observed in postembryonic juveniles, while a single novel gene, dd <dig>  was up-regulated in the embryonic stage. taken together, a putative physiological and developmental cascade for the defense morph formation consisting of the following steps is suggested: 1) kairomone reception by embryos, 2) physiological changes through endocrine mechanisms including jh and insulin pathways, 3) morphogenesis triggered by pattern formation genes .

based on the results obtained in this study, many genes are thought to be involved in the d. pulex defense morph formation. although we discussed about these genes exclusively in the developmental contexts, it is also possible that they contribute to the plasticity in life history traits such as depth selection  <cit> . furthermore, we might underestimate gene expression levels in the kairmone-exposed first-instar juveniles because they were protected in mothers' brood chamber during their sensitive period. for these reasons, given that other genes not identified in this study may also be involved in the predator-induced polyphenisms, further analyses deserve to be undertaken to identify such genes. furthermore, for the genes identified in this study, localization and functional analyses need to be performed to further clarify the mechanism of inducible defense in d. pulex.
