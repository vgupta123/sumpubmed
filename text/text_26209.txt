BACKGROUND
a hallmark of cocaine addiction is continued drug craving and relapse propensity despite long-term drug abstinence. development of effective cocaine addiction treatments therefore requires therapies that decrease the likelihood of relapse to cocaine abuse in the recovering addict. a central theme of cocaine abuse research is the role of neurobiological changes  in the development and maintenance of the addicted behavioral phenotype .

cocaine addiction generally starts with recreational use and deteriorates over time into a compulsive and chronically relapsing drug-taking disorder  <cit> . stress, environmental cues, and conditioned stimuli have been demonstrated clinically to play a role in cocaine relapse  <cit> . while initiating drug abstinence can be accomplished through in-patient treatment, maintaining cocaine abstinence has proven difficult  <cit> . in controlled clinical trials, prolonged cocaine abstinence is often achieved by only a minority of patients  <cit> . this may be due to increases in cocaine craving during drug abstinence  <cit> . understanding the persistent neurobiological changes that contribute to continued drug craving during abstinence and relapse potential represents an important step towards identifying treatments that reduce the likelihood of relapse  <cit> .

there is a growing understanding of the acute gene/protein expression changes with cocaine administration  that may be important to the development and expression of cocaine-responsive behavior  <cit> , but only a small number of studies have examined whether these changes revert to normal levels or remain altered with cocaine abstinence. observations of molecular changes persisting into or occurring during this abstinence period provide the opportunity to identify genes and their protein counterparts that could be used as therapeutic targets to decrease relapse liability.

the development of animal models of cocaine abuse and abstinence has led to the identification of rodent behaviors similar to those of human cocaine abusers. most notably, time-dependent increases in cocaine seeking and taking behaviors have been observed in the rat model of cocaine abuse and enforced abstinence employed in this study  <cit> . similar observations have been made using other animal models of prolonged abstinence from cocaine  <cit> . molecular analyses of these models have not only identified changes in gene or protein expression  <cit> , but have also correlated gene expression with cocaine-responsive behaviors  <cit> . many of the existing reports used targeted approaches to quantify specific gene and protein expression changes during abstinence from cocaine. large-scale discovery studies with long-term enforced abstinence following cocaine self-administration are limited and transcriptomic studies, in particular, have not been conducted.

the self-administration paradigm used in this study exhibits increased reinforcing efficacy, drug seeking, and drug taking with at least  <dig> days, and as long as  <dig> days, of abstinence after a period of cocaine self-administration  <cit> . examination of mesolimbic structures in these animals is warranted by the roles that these structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex  and nucleus accumbens , play in reward and behavioral responses to stimuli. both of these brain regions have been implicated in cocaine abuse and withdrawal through imaging  <cit> , behavioral  <cit> , and molecular  <cit>  studies. we have conducted targeted mrna and epigenetic analysis from this model previously  <cit> . the aim of the present study was to extend this initial analysis of mesolimbic dopaminergic terminal regions by providing a genome-wide characterization in both the mpfc and the nac of rats following  <dig> days of cocaine self-administration and after increasing periods of enforced abstinence from cocaine . identification of genes persistently altered in expression by cocaine or altered during a period of cocaine abstinence provides insight into the mechanisms involved in the long-term behavioral changes that occur with cocaine abuse and illuminates novel potential new targets for pharmacological intervention.

RESULTS
animals
behavioral analyses of the rat cocaine self-administration paradigm and time points used in this study have been published previously  <cit> . the specific animals used in this study represent an independent set that was not behaviorally tested  to avoid any confounding effects of behavioral testing on gene expression. all cocaine self-administering groups were maintained on a continuous access  discrete trials  schedule for  <dig> days. trials were limited to  <dig> trials per hour . after  <dig> days of dt <dig> responding, animals were subjected to  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> days of enforced abstinence. the cocaine intake data for the specific animals used in this study is presented in table  <dig>  no significant differences were observed in the total cocaine intake of each group or the average number of daily injections. the similarity in total cocaine intake and responding between groups minimizes the possibility that exposure to differing amounts of cocaine, or a difference in self-administration behavior, could account for gene expression changes observed. microarray studies of the mpfc were conducted on naïve, 1-day abstinent, and 100-days abstinent animals . microarray studies of the nac were conducted on naïve, 1-day abstinent, and 10-days abstinent animals  from the same cohort. for confirmatory qpcr analyses of gene expression levels, a larger number of samples were tested, including those included in microarray studies. additionally, while microarrays were conducted on samples from three time points, all four time points were used for these confirmation studies  to provide finer temporal resolution.

* naïve animals were not exposed to cocaine, and therefore have zero intake. there were no significant differences in cocaine intake or number of injections per session between groups. "arrays" indicates animals used for microarray analysis and "qpcr confirmation indicates animals used for confirmatory qpcr analysis. all of the samples from the array analysis were included in the qpcr confirmation. data is presented as mean ± s.d.

microarray analysis
in the mpfc, gene products corresponding to a total of  <dig>  probes  were confidently detected, based on signal intensity at a fixed value above background levels. in the nac analysis, mrnas for a total of  <dig>  probes were detected. differentially expressed genes were identified through a combination of statistical significance  and a fold change filter of = <dig>  fold change . this illuminated  <dig>  gene expression changes in the mpfc  and  <dig> gene expression changes in the nac . these changes demonstrated three types of temporal profiles . category  <dig> changes are those that occurred with cocaine self-administration , but that did not persist into longer periods of abstinence . a majority of the mpfc gene expression changes belonged to this category ; however, only a small fraction of changes in the nac  exhibited this expression pattern. category  <dig> changes are those that occurred with cocaine self-administration and persisted into periods of abstinence . a small number of gene expression changes from each brain region  belonged to this category. finally, category  <dig> changes are those that did not occur with cocaine self-administration, but changed during the period of abstinence . approximately 33% of the changes in the mpfc  and 76% of the changes in the nac  belong to this category. a comparison of the genes changed at any time point between the mpfc and nac reveals that a limited number of changes were observed in both brain regions . of the total of  <dig> gene expression changes, less than 3% were detected in both the mpfc and the nac. a full list of gene expression changes is presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  and has been uploaded to the gene expression omnibus online database.

confirmatory qpcr
qpcr analysis was used to confirm a subset of gene expression changes observed in the microarray analyses. genes chosen for qpcr confirmation were selected based on ontological classes with potential roles in drug-induced changes in the brain. additional genes were included in the confirmation studies based on previous reports of cocaine-responsive gene expression .

differentially regulated genes confirmed in this study , belong to each of the  <dig> categories described above . in the mpfc, neurofilament light  was the only category  <dig> change, with a 20% decrease in the mpfc at 1-day of abstinence . category  <dig> changes included a 23% decrease in levels of cd <dig> at 1-day that persisted through 10-days of abstinence , and an increase in levels of dopamine receptor d <dig>  at 1-day  and 100-days of abstinence  . finally, levels of adenosine a2b receptor  were unchanged by cocaine administration, but were reduced by 20% after 10-days of abstinence  .

in the nac, nine genes were confirmed, most of which displayed a category  <dig> profile of changing during abstinence. these include beta-catenin , adenylate cyclase-associated protein  <dig> , cysteine-rich protein  <dig> , dynamin  <dig> , early growth response  <dig> , fucosyltransferase  <dig> , glial fibrillary acidic protein , and g-protein coupled receptor  <dig>  . the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1d , which was decreased at 1-day  and remained decreased at 10-days  represents the only confirmed category  <dig> change .

consistent with our previous findings in this animal model and at the same time points  <cit> , the microarray analysis performed in this study detected significant changes in activity-related cytoskeletal associated protein , cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript , early growth response  <dig> , fbj osteosarcoma oncogene , neuropeptide y , and nuclear receptor subfamily 4a <dig>  transcript levels. prior to the microarray analysis, we had examined these genes by qpcr based on their known responsiveness to cocaine and have already reported these results  <cit> . persistent decreases  in arc, fos, and nr4a <dig> were observed in both the mpfc and nac. category  <dig> changes in cart, npy  and egr <dig>  in the mpfc were also confirmed by qpcr .

data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean , anova with student-newman-keuls post hoc testing; * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , # p <  <dig> . data previously reported in  <cit> .

ontological and network analysis
analysis of the gene ontology  categories of changes in each brain region identified a number of molecular functions significantly regulated with cocaine self-administration and abstinence. the molecular functions altered were anatomically distinct. in the mpfc, the most-represented class, consisting of ~ 25% of the changes identified by microarray analysis, was protein serine/threonine kinase activity, followed closely by structural components of the ribosome and monovalent inorganic cation transporter activity . the most represented classes among the changes in nac gene expression were hydrolase activity , and phosphoric ester hydrolase activity .

network analysis, conducted using ingenuity pathways analysis software , was performed to determine the relationships between confirmed gene expression changes from this study and previously reported changes from this model  <cit> . to complement the go analysis, additional analysis was conducted to determine whether these genes are implicated in specific pathways and/or biological functions and diseases. only those genes confirmed by qpcr were used in this analysis. in the mpfc, these molecules comprise a network of interactions involved in synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling, and mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase  signaling. in the nac, all  <dig> molecules were components of a network of interactions with members linked to the neuronal cytoskeleton, glial cells, and wnt and tumor necrosis factor  signaling functions.

discussion
this study represents the first microarray analysis of mesolimbic gene expression following long-term enforced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. transcriptomic studies of cocaine-induced gene expression changes have been conducted, but these have focused on non-contingent cocaine administration and no or limited  abstinence. the work conducted in the present study used a model with well-characterized behavioral changes during periods of abstinence, and used animals not subjected to behavioral testing during abstinence  so that the gene expression changes observed are free from the effects elicited by behavioral testing conducted before sacrifice. additionally, it is important to note that all groups  self-administered equivalent amounts of cocaine over the  <dig> days of discrete trial cocaine self-administration. this time-course analysis of gene expression allows for discrimination of gene expression changes associated with increased drug seeking  from those that occur with cocaine self-administration, but do not persist for as long as increased drug seeking and taking .

the literature describes a number of neurobiological changes  with different models of cocaine abuse, . whether these changes persist into periods of abstinence, however, has generally not been determined. in this study, gene expression changes that occurred as a result of cocaine self-administration and abstinence segregated into three categories of expression patterns. category  <dig> changes were defined as those that occur with cocaine use, but do not persist into periods of abstinence. these were observed as changes only between naïve animals and 1-day abstinent animals. after only  <dig> day of abstinence, an increase in drug seeking and drug taking is not observed  <cit> , so the changes in gene expression observed at this point may be necessary, but are not sufficient, to cause the incubated phenotype and are primarily due to exposure to cocaine. category  <dig> changes are those that occur with cocaine use that persist with periods of abstinence. these were observed to be altered in the comparisons between naïve and 1-day abstinent animals and between naïve and 10- or 100-day abstinent animals. these alterations may result from cocaine exposure, but do not return to naïve levels with cessation of the cocaine stimulus. the persistence of these changes may indicate their potential role in the development  or maintenance  of abstinence-persistent increases in drug seeking and drug taking behaviors. category  <dig> changes consist of genes that were unchanged with cocaine use, but are altered during the abstinence period. while not immediately affected by cocaine exposure, this set of changes may result from initiation or continuation of abstinence. these may function synergistically with other  changes to contribute to the development of increased drug-seeking and -taking.

mpfc
the mpfc mediates executive function and decision making processes and is therefore a key neuroanatomical region in addictive behaviors  <cit> . in response to cocaine administration, changes in metabolic activity, neurotransmitter systems, and gene or protein expression occur in the mpfc . in this study, a large number of gene expression changes were observed in the mpfc both as a result of cocaine self-administration and with subsequent enforced abstinence. most of these changes occurred as a direct result of the cocaine self-administration  and a majority  returned to cocaine-naïve levels with cessation of cocaine self-administration. as expected many changes  in gene expression require continued cocaine stimulus to remain altered, and return to normal levels after the stimulus is removed. a subset of genes  remained changed after 100-days of enforced abstinence. persistence of gene expression changes with abstinence  requires maintenance via other mechanisms. epigenetic changes occur in response to cocaine, and may constitute a regulatory mechanism for persistent changes in gene expression  <cit> . changes  that do not occur during cocaine self-administration, but are induced with abstinence  may reflect the withdrawal of the cocaine stimulus and development of the incubated phenotype.

altered gene expression of adora2b, arc, cart, cd <dig>  drd <dig>  egr <dig>  fos, nefl, npy, and nr4a <dig> were confirmed by qpcr. we have previously described altered expression of arc, cart, egr <dig>  fos, npy, and nr4a <dig> in these samples in a directed study of genes with known relevance to drug abuse  <cit> . a number of the qpcr confirmation analyses that did not reach statistical significance demonstrated expression profiles similar to those observed in the microarray. this may reflect the effects of neuroanatomical complexity on quantitation of gene expression endpoints and the inclusion of larger numbers of animals in the confirmatory experiments.

this work identified altered expression of two g-protein coupled receptors , a cell-surface signaling molecule , and a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton . increased drd <dig>  and signaling through this receptor, have been reported to decrease responsiveness to cocaine  <cit> . similarly, adenosine signaling has been implicated in drug addiction. specifically, activation of adora2b receptors attenuates cocaine-conditioned place preference  <cit> . although the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, drd <dig> signaling is implicated in neuronal activities including long-term potentiation , and reinforcement learning  <cit> , while both drd <dig>  <cit>  and adora2b  <cit>  appear to affect ca2+ dynamics.

the decrease in cd <dig> expression in this model is a novel observation and is of interest due to its function in neuronal development  <cit> . nefl functions in cytoskeletal organization and cell-surface receptor remodeling  <cit> , which may be impaired with the observed decrease in expression at 1-day of abstinence. previously, changes in protein levels and post-translational modifications of nefl, and other neurofilament isoforms, have been reported with cocaine, morphine, alcohol, and nicotine administration  <cit> .

we have previously reported a directed analysis of immediate early genes  and neuropeptides  in this animal model  <cit> . these genes were also identified in the current discovery microarray analysis, providing increased confidence in the microarray findings. these genes play important roles in a number of neuronal processes including learning and memory  <cit> , synaptic plasticity  <cit> , ca2+ signaling  <cit> , and mapk signaling  <cit> .

network analysis was conducted using the set of confirmed mpfc gene expression changes, and revealed that cart, npy, nr4a <dig>  fos, egr <dig>  adora2b and drd <dig> all interact  with the mapk/erk pathway. while altered expression of mapk/erk pathway elements was not detected in this study, changes in expression and activity levels of mapk/erk genes have been reported  and this pathway is thought to play an important role in drug-induced changes in the brain  <cit> . regulators of ca2+ dynamics were also identified in the network analysis. the changes in drd <dig>  adora2b, cd <dig> and cart expression may indicate a decrease in intracellular ca2+ signaling that occurs with cocaine self-administration and persists into periods of abstinence  <cit> .

additionally, the gene expression changes identified indicate that synaptic plasticity may be affected by cocaine self-administration and abstinence. persistent reductions in levels of cd <dig> and arc, and inductions in levels of drd <dig> and npy suggest altered synaptic plasticity process involved in memory formation and removal of old memory traces, respectively  <cit> . a potential reduction in synaptic plasticity in the mpfc with cocaine self-administration/abstinence is hypothesized based on levels of cd <dig>  nefl, arc, egr <dig>  and npy  <cit> . these data are in agreement with studies of the direct role of psychostimulants on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, including ltp and ltd, in the mesolimbic system  <cit> . in total, these gene expression changes may contribute to persistently altered synaptic plasticity in the mpfc.

nac
the central role of the nac in psychostimulant reward is well documented  <cit> . while cocaine exerts common actions on the nac and mpfc  <cit> , we observed little overlap ) between these brain regions. the regulated genes common to both brain regions include iegs reported previously  <cit> , various signaling molecules, and genes involved in cellular metabolism. when the microarray datasets were examined by ontological analysis distinct molecular functions were observed in each brain region. this indicates that the functional changes occurring in the mpfc and nac may differ and may ultimately play different roles in abstinence-dependent behaviors.

unlike the mpfc, fewer category  <dig> and  <dig> changes were observed in the nac , than category  <dig> changes  . of the cocaine-induced changes, only  <dig> persisted into periods of abstinence , while the remainder returned to pre-cocaine levels. arc, beta-catenin, cap <dig>  crip <dig>  dnm <dig>  egr <dig>  fos, fut <dig>  gfap, gpr <dig>  htr1d, and nr4a <dig> were all confirmed by qpcr to be differentially expressed. we have previously demonstrated the responsiveness of arc, fos and nr4a <dig> in this animal model  <cit> .

published data regarding cap <dig>  crip <dig>  fut <dig>  and gpr <dig> in the brain are limited, with no previous reports of cocaine-responsiveness. crip <dig> , cap <dig>  and dnm <dig> are cytoskeletal function and organization genes  <cit> . interestingly, dnm <dig> is regulated by the transcription factor arc, also altered in the nac with cocaine  <cit> . among the remaining changes, egr <dig> and gfap have been previously demonstrated to be cocaine-responsive  <cit> . htr1d has been linked with a number of psychiatric disorders  <cit> . changes in the expression of these genes may also indicate cocaine induced alterations in receptor signaling, glial cell function, and synaptic plasticity.

beta-catenin, which was increased at 10-days of abstinence in this study, is a well-characterized protein that regulates cell growth as a part of the wnt signaling pathway. as a part of wnt signaling, beta-catenin also plays a role in synaptic plasticity  <cit> . in response to chronic cocaine, beta-catenin has been shown to increase in a number of brain regions  <cit> . fut <dig>  a fucosyltransferase protein, also increased at 10-days of abstinence in this study, has been shown to increase upon wnt/beta-catenin activation  <cit> , indicating that there may be a coordinated activation of wnt signaling during periods of abstinence from cocaine.

network analysis of the confirmed genes in the nac identified a tnf-centered network. generally involved in inflammatory processes, tnf has not been historically associated with behavioral responses to cocaine. studies performed on the effects of cocaine on macrophages have reported that cocaine suppresses lps-stimulated tnf expression  <cit> . tnf induction was recently demonstrated to reduce conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization caused by methamphetamine and morphine administration  <cit> . if tnf does play a role in the behavioral responses to cocaine, these additional genes may represent regulatory and effector elements of a tnf network.

while these reported changes represent new insights into abstinence-induced changes in the brain, localization of these changes to specific cell types is still to be determined. as with other functional genomic and proteomic approaches looking at dissected brain regions, even these specific dissections contain a heterogeneous cellular population. future molecular neurobiology studies that seek to extend these, and other findings, will need to utilize techniques  to localize changes to specific cell types and neuronal networks  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in addition to offering further evidence of long-lasting changes in gene expression following abstinence from cocaine self-administration, these results identify cellular processes that may regulate the development and/or maintenance of incubation of drug-seeking and drug-taking. a number of additional changes in gene expression remain to be examined in future studies, but the results presented here support the finding that persistent shifts in gene expression can last long into abstinence. in the mesolimbic reward pathway, changes in the mpfc may be more pronounced than in the nac and involve mostly distinct sets of genes. this may indicate different metaplastic processes occur in these brain regions with the development and expression of abstinence-induced behaviors. in the mpfc, changes in mapk/erk and calcium signaling and in synaptic plasticity occur. the alterations in the nac suggest a possible role of wnt and tnf-mediated signaling in cocaine-associated behaviors. together the findings of this study highlight a number of pathways and processes in the brain that may play roles in the development and maintenance of abstinence-induced drug seeking and drug taking. a clear understanding of how these novel changes contribute to relapse liability will not only increase our knowledge of the neurobiology of addiction, but will provide targets for therapeutic development.
