BACKGROUND
cancer is a complex disease and is strongly influenced by a number of factors including genetics, epigenetics, behavioural aspects and the environment. at the cellular level, these factors impact on cell signalling leading to uncontrolled proliferation and cell migration with adverse consequences in the formation of tumours and metastases. the stroma is known to regulate mammary gland development
 <cit>  and under some circumstances, also promote breast cancer
 <cit> . stromal contents include fibroblasts
 <cit> , immune cells
 <cit> , adipocytes
 <cit> , and extracellular matrix , which can regulate the survival, proliferation and invasion of tumour cells.

breast cancers have a high stromal content, which is characterized by activation of fibroblasts , increased vascularisation, increased deposition of stromal collagen, and cross-linking and reorientation of ecm
 <cit> . increased deposition of stromal collagen or “desmoplasia” is associated with enhanced matrix stiffness. desmoplasia can promote the proliferation of normal and transformed cells and increase cell invasion and metastasis
 <cit> . furthermore, high mammographically dense tissue  as a pre-existing condition poses one of the highest risk factor for breast cancer development
 <cit> . the predominant component of high mammographically dense tissue is connective tissue consisting mostly of collagen
 <cit> . provenzano et al.,
 <cit>  studied mice with a mutation in the α <dig> chain of type  <dig> collagen that dramatically reduces collagen proteolysis. mammary glands of these mice exhibit increased collagen deposition and show signs of hyperplasia such as irregular epithelial boundaries.

single tumour cell migration in three-dimensional  matrices can be classified into broad categories known as amoeboid and mesenchymal migration. single tumour cell migration in three-dimensional  matrices can be classified into broad categories known as amoeboid and mesenchymal migration. mesenchymal migration is characterized by elongated spindle-like cell morphology and requires integrin-mediated matrix-focal adhesion interactions, cortical f-actin, stress fibres formation, and expression of proteases
 <cit> . unlike mesenchymal migration, amoeboid cells do not require proteolysis or integrins for migration
 <cit> . amoeboid migration refers to movement of rounded or ellipsoid cells, which has no mature focal adhesions and stress fibres
 <cit> . cell movement is driven by actin polymerization and rapid expansion and contraction of the cell body that allows the cells to squeeze through pores in the ecm
 <cit> . amoeboid- and mesenchymal-like cells might utilize proteolysis for migration depending on the density
 <cit> , the presence of cross-links
 <cit>  and the fibrillar or non-fibrillar nature of the matrices
 <cit> . in the lower spectrum of matrix densities, amoeboid-like tumour cells exhibit non-proteolytic migration by rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase -associated contractility or protrusion-led mechanisms
 <cit> . protrusion-led migration occurs independently of integrins and it is driven by protrusions
 <cit> . this can occur in low-density collagen matrices where contraction-inhibited dendritic cells are able to reach the same instantaneous velocity peak as control cells mainly through pushing forces generated by actin polymerisation during protrusion formation
 <cit> .

increased expression of rhoa or rhoc gtpases and/or their rock1/ <dig> effectors has been reported in several metastatic cancers
 <cit> , and they play important roles in tumour progression and invasion
 <cit> . these molecules also partake in mechanotransduction of signals in response to external tensional stimuli
 <cit> .

this work investigates the role of dense collagen matrices that resemble the matrix densities of mammary breast cancer tissues in regulating the migration of tumour cells. mtln <dig> rat mammary carcinoma cells were observed to maneuver between collagen fibrils during migration into dense matrices utilizing cell contractility. these cells also have significantly higher rock <dig> activity levels in high-density  compared to low-density  matrices, indicating matrix-dependent regulation. rock <dig> levels and activity were sensitive to hdac inhibition by ms- <dig>  which was abrogated when notch <dig> was blocked. inhibition of rock <dig> and metalloproteases by themselves had no effect on cell migration indicating alternation of invasion strategies. however, in the presence of both inhibitors, cell migration was significantly blocked.

RESULTS
preparing in vitro collagen matrices with similar collagen content and organization to high mammographically-dense tissues 
regions of low or high mammographic density in prophylactic invasive ductal carcinoma  tissues were macrodissected and processed for imaging and quantitative analyses . masson’s trichrome staining showed that hmt regions contained mostly collagen  with isolated clusters of glandular cells whereas low mammographically-dense tissues  consisted mainly of adipose cells with little presence of collagen . collagen concentrations were estimated using picrosirius red to stain collagen and measuring dye uptake at 531 nm absorbance wavelength. compared against known standards, the collagen content in lmt and hmt were measured to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/cm <dig>  respectively . high-density  collagen matrix was prepared by centrifugation to increase collagen concentrations and polymerisation using vaporised nh4oh. a centrifugation time of 60 min was found to be suitable for preparing hd matrices at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/cm <dig>  similar to that for hmt extracts . the fibril densities were comparable between hmt tissue and hd matrix measuring  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm of fibril/mm <dig>  respectively . similarly, in lmt tissue, the density  <dig>  ±  <dig> , was similar to that of ld matrix which measured  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm of fibril/mm <dig>  pore sizes between tumour tissue and in vitro matrices are also comparable with hmt and hd pore sizes measuring  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively, while those of lmt and ld measure  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the collagen fibril size of the hd matrix was very similar to hmt tissue, with 62% of the fibrils lying within 125–225 nm for both matrices . furthermore, the matrices resembled the collagen nanostructures and fibrillar networks found in native tissues
 <cit> , evident from the presence of ~63 nm d spacings and helical fibril conformations . to understand the relationship between cell migration and matrix density, we compared the properties of low-density   and high-density   collagen matrices. ld matrix contained larger pore spaces and was less viscoelastic compared to hd matrices .

physical matrix properties, cell migration, and gene expression
tumour cells of epithelial origins migrate away from the primary tumour by first breaching the basement membrane, which has low values of young’s modulus or low resistance to elastic deformation. paszek and weaver, 2004
 <cit> , measured this to be 175 ± 37 pa for reconstituted basement membrane, which is similar to the elastic modulus of collagen matrices at 1–2 cm <dig>  our measurements of 1 cm <dig> collagen matrices also fall on the low end at <100 pa. by contrast, hd matrix is approximately 10-fold stiffer compared to ld matrix. this suggests that hd matrix recovered more easily from deformation while the latter was more susceptible to deformation forces . therefore, tumour cells essentially cross from a low collagen content and “malleable” milieu of the basement membrane and into highly dense and rigid collagen matrices . it was also recently shown that tumour cells are attracted to regions of high matrix stiffness, a mechanism known as durotaxis
 <cit> . the present model is designed to study how tumour cells enter hd collagen matrix similar in density to tumour matrices. tumour cells are seeded on top of the hd matrix, which mimics the breaching of tumour cells from a region of low or negligible stromal density into highly dense tumour stroma. seventy-two hours after seeding, 89%  and 100%  of cells have invaded into ld and hd matrices, respectively. cell shape was determined from measurements of circularity and aspect ratio. circularity ratios approaching  <dig>  represent a perfect circle while aspect ratio is the length of the major axis divided by the minor axis. cells in ld matrix have larger circularity values and lower aspect ratio values than those in hd matrix suggesting a rounder cell shape . live-cell confocal microscopy shows that in ld matrix, the cell appears rounded and during migration, forms membrane blebs due to contractility of the cortex. in hd matrix, a very different morphology is apparent where a large protrusion forms through a series of membrane ruffling and extension events leading to the generation of fine filopodia distally . in hd matrix, the protrusive cell front leads the migration process. the nucleus, being a tall and rigid structure, required a long period to move past barricading matrix fibrils. this was assisted by cytoplasmic streaming and cell contractility that forced the cell body into the hd matrix .

the expression of rock <dig> transcript and rock protein activity are increased in high-density matrix
to investigate whether matrix densities might alter the expression of invasion-related genes, we performed quantitative rt-pcr using total rna from cells migrating in ld and hd matrices. hd collagen matrix significantly increased mt1-mmp, n-wasp, fascin, cortactin and rock <dig> . to further investigate how matrix density might affect rock, its expression and protein activity were quantified. quantitative pcr results revealed up to  <dig> fold higher expression of rock <dig> transcript in hd matrix compared to ld matrix. rock kinase activity assay was performed using the recombinant myosin phosphatase targeting subunit  <dig>  as a rock substrate and anti-phospho-mypt <dig>  as the labeling antibody. rock inactivates myosin phosphates through specific phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit <dig> at thr <dig> . rock activity was also significantly increased in hd suggesting that mtln <dig> cancer cells use more active rock to invade through denser matrix .

rock inhibition suppressed cell invasion in a context-dependent manner
the methodology we apply for studying cell migration is consistent with the above observations. here, tumour cells are seeded on top of matrices, and allowed to migrate for several days simulating possible scenarios in vivo where cells might migrate through matrices with densities that are from close to zero to as high 20 mg/cm <dig>  projections of the x-z plane of confocal microscope indicate that the tumour cells migrate deeper into the matrix over time. by 72 h, imaging data confirmed that most cells have become completely submerged into the matrices . in order to determine how inhibiting rock might affect the migration of tumour cells, 48 h assays were performed in the presence or absence of the rock inhibitor, y- <dig>  box and whiskers plot indicate that 50% of cells lying between the upper and lower quartiles are migrating distances of between  <dig> and 40 μm in ld matrix and 12–18 μm in denser matrices of 10–20 mg/cm <dig> . in ld matrix, the presence of the rock inhibitor reduced the values to 4–6 μm but there were no significant effects on cell migration in the higher density matrices . it is possible that the tumour cells are adaptable to the inhibitor, switching to either protrusion- and/or protease-lead migration modes, masking the effects of y- <dig>  to test this, tumour cells were incubated with y- <dig> as well as gm <dig>  the wide spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor. the mmp inhibitor, gm <dig>  has been utilized over a range of concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> μm
 <cit> . at a critical concentration of the gm <dig> inhibitor , addition of y- <dig> significantly blocked cell migration whereas the presence of either inhibitor alone had no effect .

ms- <dig> downregulated the protein expression and kinase activity of rock <dig> in hd matrices
the cellular microenvironment governing cell adhesion was previously shown to regulate rock expression via epigenetic means
 <cit> . we hypothesise that matrix density might also modulate rock in similar ways. to test this, we used the histone deacetylase inhibitors, ms- <dig> and valproic acid , to investigate whether histone modification might be responsible for rock activation in hd matrix. there are several naturally occurring and synthetic hdac inhibitors including trichostatin a , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid , ms- <dig> and vpa. ms- <dig> is an orally active, synthetic hdac inhibitor that selectively inhibits class  <dig> hdacs such as hdac <dig> and hdac3
 <cit> . this benzamide derivate has better physicochemical  properties and less toxicity than trichostatin 
 <cit> . it has been tested in over  <dig> human cancer cell lines, a variety of human tumour xenograft models and in patients with advanced acute leukemia, advanced solid tumours or lymphoma
 <cit> . srivastava et al.,  <dig> reported that treatment of ms- <dig> in a breast cancer mouse model , induced growth arrest, apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis, migration and metastasis
 <cit> . vpa is an established and well-tolerated drug for epilepsy. it inhibits class i hdacs and also shows anti-tumour activity in a variety of human cancer cell lines including estrogen-sensitive and estrogen- insensitive breast cancer cell lines
 <cit> . it is less toxic compared to tsa
 <cit>  and is in phase ii and iii clinical trials for many human cancers
 <cit> . ms- <dig> and vpa are selected for this study for their functional similarity and low toxicity. in hd matrix, the expression of genes associated with invasion such as tgf-β <dig>  rock <dig> and fascin were shown to be significantly downregulated by ms- <dig> . vpa similarly significantly downregulated rock <dig> at the transcript level . in addition, western blotting demonstrated that the amount of rock <dig> protein was significantly reduced by 60% in the presence of  <dig> and  <dig> μm of ms- <dig> . similarly, a kinase activity assay followed by immunoblotting showed that rock kinase activity was significantly inhibited by treatment with  <dig> and  <dig> μm of the ms- <dig> inhibitor, by 40% and 90%, respectively .

blocking protein synthesis abrogated the downregulation of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> in hd matrix
ms- <dig> downregulated rock <dig> expression at the mrna and protein levels as well as the activity of rock <dig>  we next asked whether the inhibition of rock <dig> is a direct effect of ms- <dig>  cycloheximide  is a well-known protein inhibitor that blocks protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro. chx interferes the translocation of amino acids to ribosome by affecting the ribosomal donor site, thereby blocking translational initiation and elongation
 <cit> . the use of chx at 10 μg/ml together with ms- <dig> abrogated the effects of ms- <dig> alone, leading to rock <dig> levels that matched those of the control untreated sample . therefore, de novo protein synthesis is needed for the downregulation of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> 

hd matrix reduced notch <dig> expression that was abrogated by ms-275
hd matrix reduced notch <dig> expression that was reversed by ms- <dig>  in human primary keratinocytes, adenoviral transfection of p <dig> suppressed the expression of rock <dig> and conversely, downregulation of p <dig> using sirna upregulated the expression of rock1
 <cit> . furthermore, knockdown of p <dig> downregulates notch <dig> expression while p <dig> activation by ionising radiation or actinomycin d upregulate notch <dig> in human cervical keratinocytes
 <cit> . yugawa et al.,  <dig>  reported that human notch <dig> has several putative p53-resposive sequences and p <dig> transactivate the notch <dig> promoter and regulates its expression
 <cit> . notch <dig> is also regulated independently of p <dig>  for example, in the p <dig> deficient cell line, t47d, activation of notch <dig> occurs through discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase <dig> 
 <cit> . furthermore, it is well studied that hdac inhibitors, for example vpa, sbha and tsa increased notch <dig> at transcript and protein level in many cancers
 <cit> . therefore, it is possible that notch <dig> and/or p <dig> might be responsible for the indirect effect of ms- <dig> on rock <dig> expression. to test this, we first determined whether the gene expression of notch <dig> and p <dig> were regulated by matrix density, and whether this was in turn affected by ms- <dig>  hd matrix downregulated the expression of notch <dig> . furthermore, ms- <dig> increased notch <dig> transcript levels . western blot analysis of notch <dig> showed that ms- <dig> also increased the protein levels of the intracellular domain of notch <dig> , the active form of notch <dig> . unlike notch  <dig> expression, expression of p <dig> was not altered by matrix density  or by ms- <dig> treatment . therefore, notch <dig> is a candidate suppressor of rock <dig> whereby its upregulation by ms- <dig> might be responsible for indirectly reducing rock <dig> levels. chx had no effect on notch <dig> expression suggesting a direct effect of ms- <dig> in elevating notch <dig> levels . therefore, the expression of notch- <dig> might be downregulated by histone deacetylation, leading to increased expression of rock <dig> in hd matrix.

in contrast to the effects on notch <dig>  chx alone or chx and ms- <dig> treatments caused significant increases in the expression of p <dig>  there is no precedent for this observation for p <dig> but cell cycle genes have been shown to be upregulated by chx
 <cit> . furthermore, synergy between egf and chx has led to the upregulation of actin mrna transcript
 <cit> . it is likely that these effects are due to blockade of an inhibitor by chx so that in some cases, inhibition of protein synthesis can lead to upregulatory effects. this reasoning may apply to chx upregulation of p <dig> via either increased stability of p <dig> mrna or the transcription rate or both.

ms- <dig> regulated notch <dig> expression leading to the suppression of rock <dig> in hd matrices
to determine whether the increase in notch <dig> expression by ms- <dig> might be responsible for the downregulation of rock <dig>  we used the notch <dig> inhibitor, dapt, in combination with ms- <dig> in quantitative rt-pcr and kinase assay experiments. the notch pathway has a critical cleavage step involving the γ-secretase complex of four proteins. enzymatic cleavage of notch by γ-secretase complex is essential for the formation of the active intracellular notch domain . dapt is a potent γ-secretase inhibitor that inhibits the formation of nicd and its downstream pathways
 <cit> . the combination of dapt and ms- <dig> abrogated the down regulation of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> alone . the results were also confirmed using smart pool sirna to knockdown the expression of notch <dig> . similar data were found when replacing ms- <dig> with vpa. in hd matrix, vpa significantly suppressed rock <dig> expression whereas dapt increased rock <dig> mrna level. treatment with both vpa and dapt abrogated the effect of vpa alone, increasing rock <dig> expression to control levels .

discussion
breast tumours have a tendency to be highly desmoplastic with high collagen content. this work explores rock <dig> activity, regulation and cell contractility function during cell migration in high-density  matrices. live-cell imaging showed that tumour cells navigated through hd matrices by contraction of the cell body. treatment with inhibitors demonstrated a role for rock <dig> and mmps in cell migration. there was increased expression of invasive genes in hd compared to ld matrices including rock <dig>  whereby both its expression and activity were significantly upregulated in denser matrices. this effect of the microenvironment on rock <dig> was sensitive to treatment with a hdac inhibitor, ms- <dig>  which upregulated notch <dig> that in turn, suppressed rock <dig>  this was shown by downregulation of notch <dig> using sirna knockdown and dapt, which abrogated the inhibition of rock <dig> by ms- <dig> 

dense breast tissue shows increased stromal collagen and analyses of tumour material indicate that cancerous breast tissues are stiffer than healthy tissue
 <cit> . stiffness or resistance to deformation measured from young’s modulus of collagen matrices is dependent on the number of fibrillar cross-links and higher fibre densities
 <cit> . stiffer matrices promote invasion by increasing the numbers of active invadopodia
 <cit>  and increase cell proliferation by elevating rho-gtpase activity and cell adhesion
 <cit> . tumour cells in turn, remodel the extracellular matrix for example, by realigning randomly organised collagen fibres into a radial configuration to help facilitate local invasion
 <cit> . tumour cells are also known to use protease to cleave ecm components and together with other mechanisms to contract and reorganise the collagen matrix to provide space required for cell migration
 <cit> . it is conceivable that matrix reorganisation via pushing of protrusions, contraction of the cell body and local matrix proteolysis serve to reduce matrix stiffness and facilitate cell migration. this study showed that levels of rock transcript, protein and protein activity were significantly upregulated in stiff matrices coincident with the observation of cell body contractility utilised for migration. unlike other biological programs such as proliferation and differentiation where cells are committed to specific pathways, cells can switch between regulatory pathways and migration modes for invasion. protrusion-, contractility- or protease-led mechanisms are interchangeably utilised by tumour cells. these are dependent on environmental conditions and cell proclivities related to genetic make-up governing polarity, adhesion and cytoskeletal functions. variations in these factors lead to a number of permutations in the migration mode of tumour cells. for example, blockade of mmps causes mesenchymal tumour cells to switch to cell contractility for migration similar to amoeboid cells in ld matrices
 <cit> .

in hd matrix, rock inhibition had no effect on migration even though live dic microscopy showed evidence of cell contractility. it is possible that in the absence of rock, protease-led migration might compensatory. indeed, inhibiting both mmps and rock, cooperatively/synergistically reduced migration levels, albeit at the lower end of the gm <dig> concentration  used. this suggests that at a critical level of mmps, rock is required for efficient cell migration. at higher gm <dig> concentrations , addition of rock inhibitors has no further effects suggesting that rock can no longer compensate for migration. here, we are able to glimpse into how tumour cells are inherently plastic where cells can swap between migration modes utilising rock <dig> and/or mmps. residual migration  suggests that a third pathway is utilised, possibly one that controls protrusion-led migration. indeed, we observe that tumour cells migrate into dense matrices utilising enlarged protrusions that interacts with collagen fibrils to gain traction .

epigenetics have been shown to play a role in regulating rock <dig> expression as a function of cell adhesion, an environmental cue
 <cit> . cells in suspension expressed more rock <dig> compared with adherent cells and the use of an hdac inhibitor further increased the expression of rock <dig> in suspension cultures. the function of rock <dig> was to generate cell contractility that blocked adhesion in the cells in suspension
 <cit> . here we explored whether epigenetics might also play a part in the regulation of rock <dig> when cells experience microenvironmental differences in matrix stiffness. rock <dig> expression and activity was significantly upregulated in the highly elastic hd matrix compared to ld matrix. blocking hdac function using ms- <dig> downregulated rock <dig> and this could result from either direct or indirect effects of the drug.

hdacs deacetylate histones reducing accessibility of dna to the transcription machinery resulting in inactive chromatin. furthermore, histone deacetylation can also lead to methylation-dependent transcriptional activation
 <cit> . there are two possibilities as to how hdacs might increase rock <dig> transcript in hd matrix. this might occur directly through hdac promotion of histone methylation at h3k4me and activation of rock <dig> gene transcription . the alternative hypothesis is that in hd matrix, hdac suppresses an inhibitor of rock <dig> so that addition of ms- <dig> abrogates this suppression, leading to the downregulation of rock <dig>  to test this, we used cycloheximide  to block protein translation and showed that chx prevented the downregulation of rock <dig> transcript and protein activity in the presence of ms- <dig>  this suggests that the effect of ms- <dig> on rock <dig> is indirect and it is dependent on another protein upregulated by ms- <dig> 

rock activity is regulated by rho gtpase, which frees the kinase region from the autoinhibitory carboxy-terminal region of rock1
 <cit>  and it is also activated autonomously from rho
 <cit> . rock phosphorylates substrates that function in the assembly of actin filaments and in cell contractility including ezrin-radixin-moesin  proteins and mlc
 <cit> . phosphorylation of the mlc of myosin ii activates myosin atpase and consequently promotes cell contractility
 <cit> . furthermore, rock also phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit  of myosin light–chain phosphatase , a negative regulator of mlc
 <cit> , resulting in enhanced contractility. we show that using blebbistatin to block myosin ii, downstream of rock, has no effect on cell migration .

apart from self-regulation at the protein level, rock can be controlled at the transcript level. in keratinocytes, p <dig> positively regulates notch <dig> and both these factors inhibit rock1/2
 <cit> . notch is a type i transmembrane receptor with a key role in cell fate determination and the differentiation of cells during development. inhibition of notch increases tumour formation by primary human keratinocytes expressing oncogenic ras, suggesting a tumour suppressor role for notch. blockade of notch also suppressed differentiation and increased stem cell populations
 <cit> . the binding of cognate ligands to the notch receptor is followed by proteolytic cleavage of notch, releasing its intracellular active domain. notch translocates to the nucleus and interacts with dna-binding proteins such as csl, converting it from a transcriptional repressor to an activator
 <cit> . notch also binds mastermind-like  <dig>  to further elevate csl-regulated transcriptional activation
 <cit> . the notch/csl/maml pathway targets the hes and herp families of basic helix-loop-helix  transcriptional repressors
 <cit> . conserved hes-binding sites in turn, can be found in the promoter regions of rock <dig> and mrckα genes, the effectors of rhoa and cdc <dig>  respectively. notch promotes the repressor function of hes <dig> leading to the downregulation of rock <dig> and mrckα gene expression
 <cit> . furthermore, use of dapt increased the expression of rock <dig> and  <dig>  supporting the idea that notch <dig> normally controls these genes in keratinocytes to prevent tumour progression
 <cit> . the transcript levels of notch have been shown to be upregulated in mouse embryos treated with trichostatin a, a potent hdac-inhibitor
 <cit> . therefore, there is evidence to suggest that notch <dig> not only negatively regulates rock <dig> at the promoter level but that hdac inhibitors upregulate notch <dig> gene expression.

in hd matrix, we find that notch <dig> but not p <dig> was upregulated by ms- <dig> and the increase in notch <dig> levels was independent of chx. when notch <dig> activation was blocked using a γ-secretase inhibitor, dapt, or when notch <dig> levels were reduced by pooled sirna transfection, the effect of ms- <dig> on rock <dig> activity was abrogated. the data suggest that ms- <dig> directly upregulates notch <dig>  which in turn blocks rock <dig> expression perhaps via repressor activities on the rock <dig> promoter
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that amoeboid tumour cells migrate in stiff matrices by upregulating rock <dig> activity and cell contractility via an epigenetically-derived, notch1-dependant mechanism . however, the requirement for rock <dig> is conditional upon the availability of other mechanisms such as proteolysis-assisted migration.
