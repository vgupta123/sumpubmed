BACKGROUND
mineral and vegetable oil is a crucial resource for the modern human civilization, but the worldwide amount is depleting rapidly and alternatives need to be explored. an interesting alternative to decrease the dependency of western societies on these fossil and vegetable sources might be the use of oleaginous micro-organisms as described by various authors . lipids isolated from oleaginous micro-organisms can be used as components in coatings, paints, personal care products, production of fine chemicals and biodiesel thereby decreasing the dependency on vegetable and mineral oil . fatty acid methyl esters originating from the lipids of oleaginous micro-organisms  show identical fuelling properties compared to conventional diesel and could be used in modern cars without major adaptations  <cit> . at this moment the majority of biodiesel is produced from lipids, which are also used in the food chain and thus compete with food for agricultural land  <cit> . therefore, oleaginous micro-organisms growing on agricultural waste residues are an attractive class of micro-organisms for lipid production.

an interesting class of oleaginous micro-organisms are yeasts. oleaginous yeasts are able to store large quantities of tags in the form of lipid bodies in the cells. typical lipid contents range from 20 % to 76 % depending species and culture conditions. oleaginous yeasts strains studied today are e.g. yarrowia lipolytica, candida  <dig>  rhodotorula glutinis, rhodosporidium toruloides, cryptococcus curvatus, trichosporon pullulan and lipomyces lipofer. screening studies are still performed, leading to the identification of several new oleaginous yeast species . lipid accumulation is triggered by a nutrient limitation combined with an excess of carbon. mostly nitrogen limitation is used to trigger lipid accumulation, but also other nutrients as phosphorus and sulphur have been shown to induce lipid accumulation . oleaginous yeasts should preferably be able to grow to high cell densities combined with a high fatty acid content, have good growth characteristics at low ph and a broad temperature range , which facilitate the process development for future industrial applications. furthermore, the ability to grow on a broad spectrum of carbon sources make oleaginous yeasts economically interesting.

the aim of this study is to find new yeasts that meet the aforementioned criteria and are potentially suited for fatty acid production for industrial applications. to this extent  <dig> non-saccharomyces yeast species were selected and tested for the above mentioned criteria. some of these selected strains have been described as having an oleaginous character .

after selection for growth rate, lipid accumulation capacity, ability to use different carbon sources, ph and temperature optimum, schwanniomyces occidentalis was selected as the most promising strain.

RESULTS
selection of strains by tlc analysis
from a private collection  <dig> yeast strains were selected to investigate their possible oleaginous character, where for  <dig> of these strains  <dig> variants were included, resulting in a total of  <dig> yeasts tested . generally, it is considered that lipid accumulation is induced at a molar c/n ratio greater than  <dig>  <cit> . previously, it was shown that lipid accumulation in r. toruloides is observed at a c/n ratio of  <dig> and increases with an c/n ratio up to  <dig> using glucose as carbon source  <cit> . when growing y. lipolytica on glucose at a c/n ratio of  <dig> a lipid content of 36 % is reached  <cit> . in t. cutaneum a slight increase in lipid content was reached when increasing the c/n ratio from  <dig> to  <dig>  followed by a sharp decrease when the c/n ratio was further increased to  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, for c. freyschussi similar lipid content was reached at a c/n ratios of  <dig> and  <dig> whilst an increase to c/n  <dig> had a negative effect on lipid content  <cit> . not only the c/n ratio but also type of the carbon and nitrogen sources used can have an impact on lipid production  <cit> . therefore, in this study screening for novel oleaginous yeasts was performed using medium with a c/n ratio of  <dig>  without optimizing growth conditions for each individual strain, using glucose as carbon and ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. the strains listed in table  <dig> were cultivated in c/n  <dig> medium for three days. cell mass was harvested and dry weight content and triacylglyceride content was determined after saponification.table  <dig> strains used in this study

in fig.  <dig> the fatty acid content after saponification of the different strains is visualised by thin layer chromatography  using oleic acid as a positive control. since equal amounts of dry cell mass were used, the intensity of the spot represents the triacylglyceride content per gram dry weight. from the tlc analysis,  <dig> strains could be identified as strains with a high triacylglyceride content, viz.; h. californica, p. anomala, t. delbrueckii, h. beijerinckii, c. tropicalis , s. occidentalis, l. elongisporus, w. lipofer, y. lipolytica  and c. curvatus.fig.  <dig> tlc chromatogram of fatty acids isolated after saponification of  <dig> screened strains; strains were grown in shake flasks containing 30 ml medium of a c/n ratio of  <dig> at 30 °c. after 72 h total lipids were extracted followed by tlc analysis. the black spots indicate the fatty acid content per sample. oleic acid  is used as a positive control . each lane represents an equal amount of dry weight. when multiple variants of strains are used the number between brackets refers to the position of the strain variant in table 1

growth of selected strains at various temperatures
strains used in large scale production processes should preferably be robust. robustness of a strain is defined as the possibility to withstand process disturbances , without having a large influence on the productivity of the process. the effect of temperature  on cell growth was investigated for the selected yeast strains. a relatively broad t range at which the strains are still capable to grow without major changes in growth characteristics is desired in a large scale production process. in other words a shift in the temperature process control should have little effect on the final process. furthermore, the ability to grow at higher temperatures is preferred to decrease the amount of cooling needed for cultivation  <cit> .

temperature profiles  were obtained as described in the methods section. from these graphs two types of strains could be identified. strains with a relatively narrow temperature range and strains having a broad temperature range in which growth is marginally influenced. selecting the temperature area in which the growth rate is 80 % of the maximum value, it can be seen that strains h. beijerinckii and s. cerevisiae have a narrow optimum, with approximately a 5 °c bandwidth around the maximum growth. for all the other strains this bandwidth ranges from 7 °c to 9 °c, which is almost twice as broad . based on the temperature profiles s. occidentalis, p. anomala, w. lipofer and t. delbrueckii are the most robust of the strains tested.fig.  <dig> growth profiles at different temperatures; strains were grown in static 2 ml cultures using medium with a c/n ratio of  <dig> at varying temperatures. growth was determined by measuring biomass concentrations. the highest biomass concentration was defined as 100 %. the dashed rectangle indicates the temperature range in which the specific growth rate is higher than 80 % of the maximum value. depicted strains are h. beijerinckii, s. occidentalis, w. lipofer, p. anomala, t. delbrueckii and s. cerevisiae




growth on different carbon sources
production of bio-based materials should preferably be performed using renewable and low cost carbon sources . the results of the growth potential of all strains on various carbon sources is displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig> growth on agar plates containing different carbon sources

from table  <dig> it can be concluded that from the strains tested s. occidentalis can grow on all carbon sources used in this study except cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which requires the action of multiple enzymes: exo, <dig> -β-d-glucanase; endo, <dig> -β-d-glucanase; cellobiohydolase and β-d-glucosidase, which are not commonly found in yeast  <cit> . however, also some typical fungal characteristics can be observed in this strain like growth on starch that can only be achieved in the presence of glucoamylase activity, which is normally present in filamentous fungi and absent in yeasts. these findings are in line with the presence of glucoamylase activity which was already confirmed in s. occidentalis  <cit> . striking was also the growth on cellobiose requiring β-glucosidase activity, which is part of the cellulolytic enzyme activity of fungi but not of that of yeasts. the genome of s. occidentalis was sequenced and assembled and the presence of a β-glucosidase gene having an identity of 77 % with the β-glucosidase sequence of scheffersomyces stipitis cbs  <dig>  was confirmed using tblastn. growth on glycerol was tested, since it is an abundantly available side product obtained from biodiesel production. all strains except s. cerevisiae were able to grow on glycerol. the results of carbon source utilization by s. occidentalis correspond with a recent study in which different oleaginous yeast species were screened for carbon source utilization and inhibitory tolerance in order to select yeasts suitable for specific industrial applications  <cit> . in the aforementioned study of sitepu et al., s. occidentalis was found to be resistant to inhibitors at concentrations that are common in lignocellulosic hydrolysates  thereby indicating its potential to utilize these carbon sources for lipid production.

genetic engineering of oleaginous yeasts is frequently used to expand substrate utilization and further increase lipid content and productivity. the oleaginous yeast y. lipolytica is unable to utilize starch and by the combined expression of alpha-amylase and glucoamylase growth on starch led to a fatty acid accumulation of 21 % which was further increased to 27 % after media optimizations  <cit> . furthermore, tai and stephanopoulus report that co-expression of acc <dig> and dga <dig> increases fatty acid content from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %% in y. lipolytica  <cit> . a similar co-expression of acc <dig> and dga <dig> was performed in r. toruloides which increased lipid content from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %  <cit> . of the  <dig> strains tested only s. occidentalis is genetically accessible thereby indicating the potential to increase its fatty acid content, yield and carbon utilization  <cit> .

analysis of yeast cell mass
the five selected strains and s. cerevisiae  were cultivated in media with different c/n ratios for three days. cell mass was harvested and quantitatively analysed for triacylglycerides content using gas chromatography . results are shown as a function of the c/n ratio of the medium in fig.  <dig>  fatty acid per dry weight content of all strains, except s. cerevisae, increased with an increasing c/n ratio. the maximum lipid accumulation was 319 g/kg reached by t. delbrueckii at a c/n ratio of  <dig> whereas the minimum lipid accumulation was 152 g/kg reached by p. anomala at a c/n ratio of  <dig>  typical fatty acid content reached by oleaginous yeasts is higher and ranges from 360 g/kg for y. lipolytica, 580 g/kg for c. curvatus to 720 g/kg for r. glutinis  <cit> . the lower fatty acid content in this study could be attributed to the fact that cultivation conditions are not optimized. as previously demonstrated by calvey et al. in l. starkeyi both the initial c/n ratio and the agitation rate can have an impact on lipid accumulation and by lowering the agitation rate from 300 rpm to 200 rpm lipid accumulation was increased from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %  <cit> . furthermore, in l. starkeyi medium optimization while utilizing a mixture of glucose and xylose increased lipid content from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % indicating that optimal lipid production can be achieved by further optimizations  <cit> . however, it has to be noted that comparison of triacylglyceride content with other studies described in literature is difficult, since they are highly dependent on used culture conditions and c/n ratios.fig.  <dig> total fatty acid and glycogen content at different c/n ratios; strains were cultured at 30 °c and 300 rpm in 30 ml screw cap jars containing 10 ml medium of the desired c/n ratio. total lipid an glycogen content was determined on 60 mg of freeze dried cells. total lipid content  and glycogen  shown for h. beijerinckii, s. occidentalis, w. lipofer, p. anomala, t. delbrueckii. and s. cerevisiae . cultures were repeated in triplicate



to analyse the overall potential of triacylglyceride production the glycogen content per cell mass was also measured . cells undergoing nitrogen starvation are able to channel their carbon into several compounds such as lipids and glycogen  <cit> . glycogen production under nitrogen starvation indicates that lipid concentrations could potentially be increased by channeling carbon from glycogen to lipid production via metabolic engineering or by changing culture condition  <cit> . all strains tested were able to accumulate glycogen at different c/n ratio’s. high glycogen contents were observed in p. anomala, h. beyerinckii and s. occidentalis, ranging from 125 g/kg to 146 g/kg. the s. cerevisiae strain contained low amounts of glycogen which is in line with the fact that in s. cerevisiae production of trehalose is favoured over glycogen under nitrogen depletion  <cit> .

taken together all of the aforementioned criteria e.g. lipid content, growth on carbon sources, temperature and genetic accessibility we selected s. occidentalis as the most versatile strain.

a fed-batch fermentation of s. occidentalis was performed starting with an initial c/n ratio of  <dig>  maximal lipid content reached in the fed-batch fermentation was  <dig>  %, lipid productivity was  <dig>  g/l.h while dcw produced was  <dig>  g/l in 96 h .table  <dig> productivity of fed-batch fermentations of oleaginous yeasts grown on glucose

y. lipolytica

r. toruloides


in comparison the maximal lipid content in s. occidentalis of  <dig>  % is higher than that of y. lipolytica  <dig>  % when grown in a fed-batch fermentation using glucose, however it has to be noted that the initial c/n ratio for y. lipolytica was  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the total amount of lipids produced by l. starkeyi on glucose at an initial c/n ratio of  <dig> is slightly higher than for s. occidentalis  <dig>  g/l versus  <dig>  g/l  <cit> . both r. glutinis and r. toruloides surpass s.occidentalis both in lipid content  and in lipid productivity . via medium optimization and genetic engineering both lipid content and productivity in s. occidentalis could be further increased  <cit> .

growth characteristics at low ph
strains growing at relatively low ph values are more interesting, since infection problems can be reduced significantly in a large scale production process as can be seen in the dairy industry  <cit> . for this reason we investigated if s. occidentalis was able to grow by performing batch fermentations at a ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . and determining biomass after 24 h of growth. the results demonstrate that s. occidentalis was able to grow in the ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> . optimal growth was observed at a ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  with a biomass concentration of  <dig>  g/l to  <dig>  g/l, whereas biomass concentrations at ph  <dig>  where  <dig>  g/l.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to select strains with a high lipid production, broad temperature range for growth, the ability to use a wide variety of carbon sources and genetic accessibility. selection based on these criteria resulted in the selection of s. occidentalis as the most promising strain for industrial applications due to its ability to grow at a broad temperature and ph range and the ability to utilize many different carbon sources. the fatty acid production was not optimized in this study and leaves room for further improvement by optimizing process conditions and via metabolic engineering.
