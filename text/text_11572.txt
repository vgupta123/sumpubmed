BACKGROUND
ph  domains represent one of the most widely distributed domains in the human proteome, being found in over  <dig> human proteins  <cit>  involved in a wide range of diverse biological function . despite limited sequence similarity, ph domains maintain a highly conserved architecture  consisting of a seven-stranded anti-parallel β sandwich closed at one end by a c-terminal α helix. the opposing end remains open and accommodates several variable loops. loop β1/β <dig>  located between the first and second β strands often contains positively charged residues involved in ligand binding. in some ph domains this binding pocket region is extended, adopting additional secondary structure elements . ligand specificity is therefore determined primarily by the overall structure and composition of the binding pocket region  <cit> .

soon after their discovery, ph domains were shown to be important for targeting host proteins to specific sites at the membrane via specific interactions with various phosphoinositides  <cit> . phosphoinositides are lipid components of the membrane that act as key signaling molecules  <cit> . these lipids contain an inositol head group that can be reversibly phosphorylated at the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> positions to yield seven different phosphoinositides . phosphoinositides propagate cellular signals by recruiting specific signaling proteins to the membrane by means of phosphorylated inositol head groups. in addition to comprising the head groups of phosphoinositides, soluble myo-inositol phosphates  themselves also function as important second messengers  <cit> . in contrast to phosphoinositides, myo-inositol phosphates are reversibly phosphorylated at any or all of the six positions about the inositol ring, giving rise to a large variety of different signaling molecules. phosphate groups attached to the inositol ring adopt equatorial positions at  <dig> of the  <dig> possible locations. the remaining position is axial. this distribution of  <dig> equitorial and  <dig> axial positions is a key feature of myo-inositol phosphates. depending on the degree of phosphorylation and the position of the phosphates, the inositol ring itself adopts different conformations further adding to the stereospecific diversity of this class of signaling molecules.

myo-inositol phosphates such as ip <dig> have been very well characterized and shown to act as second messengers by directly binding target proteins and modulating activity  <cit> . in principle, the very abundant ip varieties could also act as signaling molecules by directly regulating interactions of ph domains with their phosphoinositide ligands  <cit> . this is a particularly attractive hypothesis given the structural diversity of inositol phosphates. diversity in inositol phosphate structure could result in interactions with ph domains that vary in terms of both mode of binding and affinity. if so, ips would provide cells with a mechanism for fine tuning the many important ph domain-phosphoinositide signaling interactions. experimental evidence in support of myo-inositol phosphates regulating ph domain-phosphoinositide interactions is growing rapidly. ip <dig> was shown to efficiently dissociate the phospholipase c  ph domain/ptdinsp <dig> interaction releasing plc from the membrane when added exogenously or generated in cells  <cit> . perhaps the most notable example however, of an myo-inositol phosphate regulating ph domain binding is that of the protein kinase b  signaling pathway. here, ip <dig>  , myo-inositol pentaphosphate, number in brackets indicates position missing a phosphate) one of the most abundant inositol phosphates in most cell, was shown to compete with ptdinsp <dig> for binding to the ph domain of akt  thereby preventing its membrane localization and subsequent activation  <cit> .

pleckstrin's carboxyl terminal ph domain  is known to bind ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . in a previous report, we showed that the myo-inositol pentaphosphate , ip <dig>  is a particularly effective inhibitor of cph binding to ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . given the central role of ph domains in cell signaling and the large diversity of ips, we were interested in further analyzing the specificity of binding for all ip <dig> isomers to several different ph domains. the present study examines whether cph is capable of specifically recognizing different ip <dig> isomers. using high resolution crystal structures the structural basis for observed ip <dig> specificity is further examined. finally, we extend the study to include  <dig> additional ph domains from grp <dig> and akt. this work demonstrates that cph possesses the specificity required to differentiate between different ip <dig> isomers. this high degree of specificity was also found to be a property of the phakt but not the grp <dig> ph domain . together, results presented here support a role for myo-inositol pentakisphosphates as regulators of ph domain/phosphoinositide signaling and further demonstrate their potential use as potent inhibitors of cell signaling.

RESULTS
inhibition of cph/ptdinsp <dig> binding by inositol pentakisphosphates
a previous study suggested that the inositol pentakisphosphate, ip <dig>  is a particularly effective inhibitor of cph binding to ptdinsp <dig>  <cit> . since there are six different ip5's we sought to determine whether individual ip <dig> isomers differed in their ability to inhibit cph/phosphoinositide interactions. this is an interesting question since ip <dig> isomers are structurally quite similar, varying only in the position of the  <dig> phosphate groups about their 6-carbon ring. a difference in inhibitory properties would suggest that cph possesses a high degree of binding specificity enabling it to discriminate between very subtle differences in ligands. the ability of ip5's to disrupt cph/phosphoinositide interactions was determined using spr. in this assay, liposomes containing ptdinsp <dig> were immobilized to the sensor surface and cph binding determined in the presence and absence of each ip <dig> isomer. as shown in figure  <dig>  the family of ip <dig> isomers does in fact differ in their inhibitory properties . ip <dig> was a significantly better binder relative to other ip <dig> molecules. the remaining ip <dig> isomers , ip <dig>  ip <dig>  ip <dig> and ip5) all had similar affinities for cph. the weakest inhibitor of cph binding was ip <dig>  these observed differences in affinity indicate that the binding pocket region of cph is able to differentiate between various arrangements of phosphate groups in the ip <dig> family. the arrangement of phosphates displayed by ip <dig> permits a particularly effective mode for interaction with cph , presumably by accommodating a favorable interaction not possible for other ip <dig> isomers. in a previous study our group determined the crystal structure of cph bound to ip <dig>  to elucidate the structural basis for the observed specificity we determined the crystal structure of cph bound to one of the lower affinity isomers ) thereby allowing for a detailed structural comparison.

structure of cph/ip <dig> complex
the crystal structure of cph bound to ip <dig> was determined to  <dig>  Å and solved by molecular replacement using the apo-cph structure  as a search model. data collection and model refinement statistics are shown in table  <dig>  the final model, refined to r and rfree values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , was well ordered with the exception of the β5/β <dig> loop . this loop was similarly disordered in previous structures of cph suggesting it is inherently flexible and most likely not directly involved in ligand binding  <cit> . three monomers of cph were present in the asymmetric unit. each of these monomers was highly similar to the others, having shared r.m.s deviations of less than  <dig>  Å. this similarity extended to the bound ip <dig> molecules which were all refined with full occupancy in the final model. the presence of ip <dig> resulted in only minor crystal contacts between monomers  and its mode of binding to the cph domain is therefore not expected to be influenced significantly by these crystal contacts. comparison of the cph/ip <dig> structure with the cph/ip <dig> structure revealed no significant conformational changes in the overall structure with one exception being the β3/β <dig> loop which adopted variable conformations as shown in figure  <dig> 

adata for the highest resolution shell are shown in parentheses.

a closer examination of the ligand binding region for the cph/ip <dig> and cph/ip <dig> structures revealed several important differences. while both ip <dig> and ip <dig> bind in the same region, each isomer adopts very different orientations in the β1/β <dig> binding pocket . the inositol rings of both ligands are orientated with the phosphate groups at the  <dig> position orientated similarly relative to the plane of the β1/β <dig> loop . the orientation of the two ip <dig> inositol rings differs by a rotation of approximately 90° about the  <dig> position. this large rotation results in ip <dig> making fewer interactions and burying less surface area  in the binding pocket. these changes provide clear structural evidence for the observed lower binding affinity of ip <dig> compared to ip <dig>  interactions formed between the two ip <dig> ligands and cph are summarized in table  <dig>  a detailed interaction list can be found in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  these results demonstrate that a single ph domain can utilize very different modes of interaction and this difference may account for variations in the overall binding of ip isomers. this implies that each ip <dig> could have a special role in differentially regulating ph domain/phosphoinositide signaling.

inhibition of phgrp <dig> and phakt binding to ptdinsp <dig> by ip <dig> isomers
having shown that cph possesses a high degree of specificity we next asked whether this property is common to other ph domains. the inhibitory properties of the ip <dig> family were tested against two additional ph domains from grp <dig> and akt. these ph domains have been well characterized structurally making them ideal for comparisons with cph. the ph domain from akt is of particular interest since it was recently shown to be regulated by ip <dig> interactions  <cit> . the study demonstrated that ip <dig> could prevent membrane association of phakt but did not report the analysis of the other ip <dig> isomers. the results for cph/ip <dig> binding suggest it is possible that another ip <dig> isomer could be a better inhibitor of phakt phosphoinositide binding.

we tested the ability of ip <dig> isomers to inhibit binding of phgrp <dig> and phakt to liposomes containing ptdinsp <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  panel a, phgrp <dig> binding to ptdinsp <dig> was inhibited in a similar way by all ip <dig> isomers . therefore, in contrast to cph, phgrp <dig> does not appear to specifically recognize different ip <dig> isomers to any significant extent. further analysis of the inhibitory properties of these isomers towards akt/ptdinsp <dig> binding did reveal significant differences in specificity, see figure  <dig>  panel b . ip <dig> was the most effective inhibitor followed by ip <dig> and ip <dig>  weakest inhibition of phakt/ptdinsp <dig> binding was observed for ip <dig> followed by ip <dig> and ip <dig> respectively. these differences suggest that like cph, phakt provides sufficient specificity in its binding pocket to differentiate between very similar ligands.

this is a particularly interesting finding given that previous studies have reported that ip <dig> is able to prevent akt localization to membranes by competing with phosphoinositides for binding to its ph domain. as a consequence, the serine phosphorylation and kinase activity of akt are inhibited resulting in apoptosis in ovarian, lung and breast cancer cells  <cit> . not surprisingly, much interest exists in developing inhibitors to akt, some of which are based on ip <dig>  <cit> . our results suggest that ip <dig> is a more effective inhibitor and may therefore provide a better starting compound for inhibitor design compared to ip <dig> 

structural determinants of ip <dig> specificity
collectively these results demonstrate that some ph domains possess enough specificity to differentiate between the six ip <dig> isomers. while varying specificities for different classes of inositol phosphates among ph domains is not a new idea, the ability to recognize very subtle differences, such as those found in the ip <dig> family, has not been well appreciated. in an attempt to understand the structural basis for the high degree of specificity observed we compared the structures of cph, phgrp <dig> and phakt.

examination of the inositol phosphate binding pockets from cph, phgrp <dig> and phakt revealed two important differences. phgrp <dig>  contains  <dig> basic residues whereas cph and phakt  contain  <dig> and  <dig> basic residues, respectively. this suggests that the number of basic residues in the binding pocket influences ip <dig> specificity. if so, a possible explanation is that too many basic residues physically restrict the possible orientations that ip <dig> isomers can adopt in the binding pocket. orientation plays an important role in specificity as demonstrated for cph. here, ip <dig> and ip <dig> adopted different orientations in the binding pocket resulting in different binding affinities. it is reasonable to expect that as a binding pocket contains increasing numbers of basic residues the space available for ip <dig> isomers to adopt different orientations will be decreased. the resulting limited orientation may permit a high affinity interaction  but the affinity will be similar for all isomers. in further support of an "orientation-restricted" binding pocket, phgrp <dig> contains a 20-residue insertion in the β6/β <dig> loop that forms a β hairpin structure. this β hairpin, not found in cph or phakt, folds back and over top of the β1/β <dig> loop, essentially capping the binding pocket . this added structural feature further restricts possible orientations that could otherwise be adopted by ip <dig> isomers. in support of this, the orientations of ip <dig>  and that of insp <dig>  which were both solved bound to grp <dig>  <cit> , adopt identical orientations in the binding pocket . to further illustrate the restricted orientations imposed by these structural features we have aligned the cph/ip <dig> structure with grp <dig>  the orientation adopted by ip <dig> is forbidden in the binding pocket of grp <dig> due to steric clashes with the β6/β <dig> insertion. it is also possible that since basic residues have long and flexible side chains, ph domains with a greater number of basic residues are more adaptable to different ligands and can therefore accommodate different inositol phosphate molecules with similar affinities.

CONCLUSIONS
work presented here substantiates the growing body of evidence that ip5's regulate ph domain/phosphoinositide interactions  <cit> . specifically, these results demonstrate that the six ip <dig> isomers differ in their inhibitory properties towards ph domains. this allows for the potential to fine tune ph domain/phosphoinositide signaling pathways. our work has direct implications for akt signaling as previous studies have shown that ip <dig> can inhibit membrane binding and subsequent activation of akt  <cit> . in light of our findings, it would be prudent to include all ip <dig> isomers in future binding studies involving ph domains and ip <dig>  the potential for a high degree of specificity demonstrated here could in theory be extended to other families of inositol phosphates. given that there are  <dig> possible inositol phosphates this provides nature with an expansive toolbox for regulating phosphoinositide based signaling pathways.

in addition to their potential role as signaling molecules, ip5's could also be used as inhibitors to probe biological pathways. a potential issue in administering exogenous ip5's is their low cell permeability. fortunately, much progress has been made towards overcoming this problem. by masking phosphate and hydroxyl groups as esters, the hydrophobicity and membrane permeability is significantly increased  <cit> . once inside the cell the ester groups are removed by host esterases yielding the original ip <dig> molecule . a similar approach can now be applied to phosphoinositides yielding new cell permeant tools for studying these signaling pathways  <cit> .
