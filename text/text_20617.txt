BACKGROUND
alternative splicing is one of the most important mechanisms to generate molecular diversity in vertebrates. a large number of alternatively spliced genes that have multiple"variable" first exons have been identified in the human genome, including protocadherin , udp-glucuronosyltransferase , plectin , neuronal nitric oxide synthase , and glucocorticoid receptor  genes  <cit> . in particular, the closely-linked vertebrate pcdh α and γ clusters have a striking genomic organization each containing more than a dozen variable first exons and three downstream "constant" exons  <cit> . alternative splicing of each variable exon to the common set of constant exons generates diverse functional mrna molecules that encode a large number of cadherin-like cell-surface proteins in the central nervous system . comparative analyses suggest that gene duplication, gene conversion, and variable exon mutation play important roles in vertebrate pcdh evolution  <cit> . in addition, adaptive selection of specific residues in the ectodomains enhances mammalian pcdh diversity  <cit> . combinatorial interactions between these pcdh proteins contribute to the establishment and maintenance of trillions of diverse yet very specific neuronal connections in the vertebrate cns.

in the vertebrate adaptive immune system, the immunoglobulin , t-cell receptor , and major histocompatibility complex  gene clusters provide the enormous diversity required for immune defense. the ig and tcr clusters are organized into variable and constant regions. gene duplications and somatic dna rearrangements generate tremendous diversity for mammalian ig and tcr molecules. moreover, positive natural selection operates on the complementarity-determining regions  of the ig and tcr proteins to increase their diversity  <cit> . the mhc genes are also clustered. the encoded mhc proteins  have a deep peptide-binding groove formed by a β-sheet bottom floor and two α-helix side walls  <cit> . each mhc protein can bind a large set of different peptides. in addition, most of the polymorphic residues on the β-sheet floor and two α-helix side walls point towards the peptide-binding groove and serve as ligands for numerous processed antigens  <cit> . finally, diversity-enhancing overdominant selection operates on the antigen-binding sites of both class i and ii mhc proteins enabling them to recognize diverse processed antigens  <cit> . vertebrate animals evolved these three gene families through birth-and-death evolution of repeated duplication and mutation, in conjunction with positive selection, to remove a staggering number of different foreign antigens in a highly specific fashion  <cit> .

vertebrate animals also remove hundreds of thousands xeno- and endobiotic lipophilic compounds from their bodies by converting them to water-soluble glucuronides through glucuronidation  <cit> . this detoxification pathway converts lipophilic aglycones to hydrophilic molecules and facilitates their excretion from the body. glucuronidation is catalyzed by members of the ugt glucuronosyltransferase proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . vertebrate ugt proteins belong to a large supergene family of ubiquitous glycosyltransferases   <cit>  . diverse members of the gt superfamily are noted for their low sequence similarity but, surprisingly, belong to only two structural folds   <cit> .

glucuronidation is also an important pathway for biotransformation and clearance of drugs, such as colorectal cancer drug irinotecan  <cit> . genetic polymorphisms or mutations in human ugt genes have profound impacts on hyperbilirubinemia, drug metabolism, and cancer treatment  <cit> . for example, mutations of the human ugt1a <dig> gene cause genetic diseases with phenotypes ranging from mild jaundice to lethal kernicterus  <cit> .

the human ugt <dig> cluster has an unusual genetic structure  which is strikingly similar to that of the pcdh clusters  <cit> . specifically, the human ugt <dig> cluster is organized into variable and constant regions  <cit> . about a dozen very similar human, mouse, and rat ugt <dig> variable exons  are organized in a tandem array, which are followed by four constant exons   <cit> . splicing of each variable exon to the four constant exons generates diverse functional ugt <dig> mrnas. each variable exon encodes a signal peptide and the n-terminal aglycone-recognition domain of a ugt <dig> protein. the four constant exons encode the common c-terminal domain that binds the udp glucuronic acid  donor substrate and an er-anchoring transmembrane segment.

the role of the ugt genes in metabolizing myriad xeno- and endobiotic compounds suggests that natural selection may have played an important role in shaping their variation; however, the effects selection might have on such unusual genomic structures are unclear. to gain insight into the evolution of multiple variable first exons, we annotated the complete vertebrate ugt <dig>  gcnt <dig>  and ugt2a repertoires and identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  new genes, respectively. phylogenetic analyses on these clusters revealed lineage-specific duplications of variable exons and conservation of constant exons. our results suggest that functional diversity of these clusters is achieved through the birth-and-death evolution of variable exon duplication, divergence, and deletion, but conservation of the constant exons, which are essential in maintaining their basic functions. in addition, analyzing the complete repertoires of closely-related ugt2b clusters in humans, mice, and rats identified a new rat ugt2b gene  and revealed extensive lineage-specific duplications.

to gain insight into the catalytic mechanisms of glucuronidation by diverse ugt glucuronosyltransferases, we sought evidence for structural features in donor and acceptor recognition by combined comparative analysis and homologous modeling  <cit> . we built the first three-dimensional  structure model of the vertebrate ugt proteins based on sequence analyses of  <dig> ugt <dig> and  <dig> ugt <dig> gt-b proteins, and the known crystal structures of the non-vertebrate gt-b glycosyltransferases. molecular docking of donor and acceptor ligands to the human ugt1a <dig> structure shed light on the specificity of the donor recognition and diversity of acceptor bindings. in particular, we identified four hypervariable regions within the n-terminal domain that form a potential acceptor-binding pocket. we also identified ugt codon sites that may have been subject to darwinian positive selection during vertebrate evolution by analyzing patterns of nucleotide  substitutions at individual codon sites. interestingly, the diversified residues in the four hypervariable regions map to an acceptor-binding pocket. these residues likely contribute to the required specificity for binding numerous hydrophobic small molecules. these results suggest that adaptive natural selection of specific codon sites plays an important role for enhancing ugt diversity. in summary, our results provide insight into the evolution of multiple variable exons and structural diversity of ugt proteins required for the removal of numerous xenobiotic compounds and endogenous metabolites.

RESULTS
the vertebrate ugt <dig> gene cluster
we analyzed ugt <dig> locus in a set of diverse vertebrate species including primates, non-primate mammals, birds, and fish . chimpanzees are the closest living relatives of humans, and their genomic sequences are highly similar to those of humans. we found that two ugt <dig> genes differ between humans and chimpanzees  although these species only diverged as recently as several million years ago  <cit> . the chimpanzee ugt1a <dig> has a complete open reading frame suggesting being a functional gene while the human ugt1a <dig> has a single-nt deletion at coding position  <dig> causing a frameshift. in contrast, the human ugt1a <dig> is a functional gene while the chimpanzee ugt1a <dig> appears to be a pseudogene because its sequences have a single-nt deletion at coding position  <dig>  this frameshift deletion is confirmed by more than  <dig> different sequence reads.

we also annotated the rhesus monkey and baboon ugt <dig> clusters . the ugt <dig> clusters in these two old-world-monkey species contain one more functional variable exon than the human and chimpanzee ugt <dig> clusters. specifically, the bilirubin group  is expanded in these two species. compared with humans and chimpanzees, the ugt1a <dig> appears to have been duplicated to ugt1a5a and ugt1a5b in both rhesus monkey and baboon . the functional duplication of ugt1a <dig> in baboon has also been reported in a very recent publication  <cit> . however, the ugt1a5b has been mutated to a pseudogene in rhesus monkey because its sequences have a single-nt insertion in the coding region . in addition, the ugt1a <dig> has been mutated to a pseudogene in both rhesus monkey and baboon. finally, the rhesus monkey ugt1a <dig> variable exon appears to have been duplicated to ugt1a4a and ugt1a4b . similarly, the baboon ugt1a <dig> variable exon has also been duplicated; however, one duplicated copy has been mutated to a pseudogene ugt1a2b . interestingly, the rhesus monkey ugt1a <dig> in the whole-genome-shotgun traces has no stop codon mutation; however, the ugt1a <dig> in the finished bac clone  has a stop codon at coding position  <dig>  this observation suggests that ugt1a <dig> has both functional and nonfunctional alleles segregating in the rhesus monkey population.

dogs belong to the order carnivora within the laurasiatheria clade of mammals; while primates and rodents belong to the euarchontoglire clade  <cit> . dogs diverged from humans at about  <dig> million years ago while rodents diverged from primates at about  <dig> million years ago. the dog ugt <dig> cluster contains  <dig> functional variable exons . members of the dog ugt <dig> cluster can also be divided into the bilirubin and phenol groups. compared with the primate ugt <dig> cluster, the genomic region of the dog ugt <dig> cluster is about  <dig> kb smaller .

the chicken separated from mammals about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . similar to the mammalian ugt <dig> clusters, the chicken ugt <dig> cluster is also organized into variable and constant regions and it has  <dig> variable exons arrayed in tandem, including one with frameshift mutations . members of the chicken ugt <dig> cluster can also be separated into bilirubin and phenol groups. the genomic region of the chicken ugt <dig> cluster is much smaller than that of mammals .

the zebrafish has supernumerary pcdh genes organized into two duplicated clusters  <cit> . consistent with whole genome duplications in the teleost fish species and similar to the duplication of the zebrafish pcdh clusters  <cit> , the zebrafish ugt <dig> cluster has been duplicated into the ugt <dig> a and b clusters each organized into variable and constant regions . in contrast to the vast expansion of the zebrafish pcdh variable regions compared with mammals, the zebrafish ugt1a and ugt1b variable regions have not expanded. specifically, compared with about a dozen ugt <dig> variable exons in mammals, the zebrafish ugt1a cluster only has seven functional variable exons, while the zebrafish ugt1b cluster has only six functional variable exons . in total, we identified  <dig> novel zebrafish ugt <dig> variable exons. both zebrafish ugt1a and ugt1b clusters span a region of about  <dig> kb genomic sequences, much smaller than other vertebrate species analyzed.

the constant regions of mammalian, avian, and fish ugt <dig> clusters are highly conserved and each contain  <dig> constant exons . the length of each constant exon is identical among all vertebrate species except that the fourth constant exons are slightly smaller in frogs and zebrafish, encoding shorter polypeptides . the two zebrafish constant sequences are highly similar with a 70% identity at the nt level and a 78% similarity at the polypeptide level. this observation strongly suggests that the two zebrafish ugt <dig> clusters are duplicated from a single ancestral cluster. the polypeptides encoded by constant regions are highly conserved in vertebrates .

evolutionary relationship among members of the vertebrate ugt <dig> clusters
similar to the pcdh clusters  <cit> , the variable region of each vertebrate ugt <dig> protein is encoded by a single unusually large exon . these ugt <dig> variable exons are similar and are of almost identical length with the same reading frame. each human, mouse, and rat ugt <dig> variable exon is preceded by a distinct promoter  <cit> . consistently, there is a highly-conserved sequence motif upstream from each vertebrate ugt <dig> variable exon , suggesting that these conserved promoter motif sequences play a role in tissue-specific ugt <dig> gene regulation in vertebrates. the encoded variable polypeptides have the same predicted 3d domain structures . each variable polypeptide consists of a signal sequence followed by an aglycone-recognition domain. their evolutionary relationships are shown as an unrooted phylogenetic tree . in conjunction with the clustered genomic organization , the tree demonstrates that variable exons of the ugt <dig> clusters are duplicated in tandem. some members are maintained, while others are inactivated by deleterious mutations in specific vertebrate lineages, suggesting that birth-and-death evolution has occurred in the ugt <dig> cluster.

the mammalian and avian ugt <dig> clusters can be divided into two major groups  . these groups each have a long major branch while members within each group have relatively shorter secondary branches in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that members within each group were duplicated recently . the human, chimpanzee, baboon, rhesus monkey, and dog ugt1a <dig> is orthologous. however, there is no obvious orthologous ugt1a <dig> in the chicken ugt <dig> cluster, suggesting that the specialization of bilirubin glucuronidation by ugt1a <dig> occurs after the divergence of mammals and birds. interestingly, the mammalian ugt1a <dig> is orthologous and is remotely similar to three avian ugt <dig> variable exons . this observation indicates that ugt1a <dig> is more ancient than other ugt <dig> members.

members of the zebrafish ugt <dig> clusters do not display orthologous relationships to those of the mammalian and avian ugt <dig> clusters. instead, they display paralogous relationships in one major branch of the phylogenetic tree . they can be divided into three subgroups: subgroup  <dig> includes z1a <dig>  z1a <dig>  and z1b <dig>  subgroup  <dig> includes z1b2-b <dig>  and subgroup  <dig> includes z1a <dig> and z1a4-a <dig>  the zebrafish ugt <dig> a and b variable exons and the corresponding constant exons seem to have resulted from a duplication of an ancestral one-variable ugt <dig> gene. subsequently, the variable exons in each cluster are duplicated multiple rounds. for example, the zebrafish ugt <dig> a <dig> and a <dig>  and a <dig> and a <dig> seem to be duplicated from an ancestral two-variable-exon unit because a <dig> and a <dig>  and a <dig> and a <dig> share more sequence similarity, respectively. however, other zebrafish ugt <dig> a and b variable exons seem to be duplicated in tandem because neighboring ones are more similar to each other.

gene conversion plays an important role in the evolution of supergene families. tandem gene arrays are often subject to sequence homogenization through gene conversion. for example, tandem arrayed pcdh variable exons undergo strikingly predominant gene conversion events, especially among physically close exons  <cit> . to determine whether gene conversion played a similar prominent role in the evolution of vertebrate ugt <dig> clusters, we used the geneconv program  <cit>  to search for gene conversion events among ugt <dig> variable exons. surprisingly, we did not find prevalent gene conversion events in the vertebrate ugt <dig> clusters, except in the dog ugt <dig> locus where gene conversion events have occurred in the phenol subgroup  . consistently, no gene conversion event was detected between any two functional baboon genes  <cit> . this observation suggests that, in striking contrast to the pcdh clusters, concerted evolution does not play a predominant role in the evolvement of the vertebrate ugt <dig> cluster.

the organization and evolution of the vertebrate gcnt <dig> cluster
the human, mouse, and rat gcnt <dig>  clusters each contain three highly similar variable exons and two constant exons  <cit>  . each variable exon is preceded by a distinct promoter and is separately spliced to a set of two constant exons to generate functional gcnt <dig> mrna. we analyzed the vertebrate gcnt <dig> clusters and found that the numbers of variable exons are different among mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes . the three gcnt <dig> variable exons are conserved in chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys . they are also conserved in dogs, mice, and rats . however, there are only two gcnt <dig> variable exons in the opossum genome . thus, the three gcnt <dig> variable exons are conserved in primates, canids, and rodents but not opossums . there are only two gcnt <dig> variable exons in the chicken and frog genomes . finally, there is only one gcnt <dig> variable exon in zebrafish . these results suggest that the tetrapod gcnt <dig> variable exons were expanded by tandem duplication during vertebrate evolution.

the vertebrate gcnt <dig> variable exons are about the same length and are very similar to each other. the encoded polypeptides are highly conserved . each gcnt <dig> variable domain has a hydrophobic transmembrane segment close to the n-terminal . they also contain six cysteine residues that are identical among all gcnt <dig> proteins . an evolutionary tree was built according to the variable gcnt <dig> polypeptides . the three gcnt <dig> variable exons display orthologous relationships among all eutherian mammals. interestingly, the two opossum gcnt <dig> variable exons display a paralogous relationship and appear to be more similar to the eutherian gcnt2b variable exons. the two chicken and frog gcnt <dig> variable exons also display paralogous relationships and are divergent from the mammalian gcnt <dig> variable exons. the single zebrafish gcnt <dig> variable exon appears most closely related to the frog gcnt <dig> variable exons. this result supports the hypothesis that the gcnt <dig> variable exons have expanded in tetrapods through tandem duplications during vertebrate evolution. the genomic organization of the gcnt <dig> constant region is highly conserved in vertebrates . for example, the first constant exons of vertebrate gcnt <dig> cluster are all  <dig> nts in length except in mice, frogs, and zebrafish, which are  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> nts, respectively. the encoded constant protein sequences are conserved and have three identical cysteine residues .

the vertebrate ugt <dig> cluster
we previously identified more than three thousand human genes with multiple first exons through a genome-wide computational analysis; however, only the first exons of the pcdh and gcnt <dig> clusters are highly similar  <cit> . we have noted that the genomic organization of the human ugt2a cluster  <cit>  is also similar to that of the ugt <dig>  pcdh, and gcnt <dig> clusters. in particular, the c-terminal domains of the human ugt2a proteins are identical and are encoded by a set of five constant exons; by contrast, the n-terminal domains are similar and each is encoded by a single variable exon. however, in contrast to the human ugt <dig> cluster, the human ugt2a cluster only contains two variable exons which share 64% nt sequence identity. the variable and constant organizations of the ugt2a cluster are conserved in human, mouse, and rat genomes . for example, the human, mouse and rat ugt2a variable exons are similar and of the same length. we annotated the ugt2a clusters in several additional mammalian species  and found that the ugt2a organization of two variable exons and five constant exons is conserved.

in contrast to the expansion of the mammalian ugt <dig> clusters compared with zebrafish , we found that the variable region of the zebrafish ugt2a cluster is expanded in comparison to the mammalian variable regions and contains  <dig> novel variable exons . phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the mammalian ugt <dig> a <dig> and a <dig> variable exons display a strict orthologous relationship . however, there is no orthologous relationship between mammalian and zebrafish ugt2a variable exons. the four zebrafish ugt2a variable exons appear to be duplicated in tandem, with the ugt <dig> a <dig> and a <dig> duplicated most recently . multiple sequence alignment demonstrates that all vertebrate ugt2a variable protein sequences are highly similar . like the constant region of the mammalian ugt2a cluster, the zebrafish ugt2a constant region contains  <dig> exons, which are highly similar to those of mammals. in particular, the sizes of constant exons  <dig> to  <dig> are identical between zebrafish and mammals, respectively. the zebrafish ugt2a constant exon  <dig> coding region is  <dig> nts longer than the corresponding mammalian ugt2a constant exon . the polypeptides encoded by ugt2a constant region are highly conserved in vertebrates .

we performed a comprehensive analysis of the closely-related human, mouse, and rat ugt2b genes and found one novel rat ugt2b gene, designated ugt2b <dig> . the human, mouse, and rat ugt2b genes are also clustered and are located very close to the ugt2a cluster  <cit> . however, the genomic organizations of the human, mouse, and rat ugt2b genes are different from the ugt2a genes in that the ugt2b genes do not share common constant exons. each member of the ugt2b cluster is an independent gene and contains six exons . all corresponding exons are highly similar among members of the ugt2b cluster. their exon lengths are also identical among different mammalian species. the encoded ugt2b proteins are highly conserved among humans, mice, and rats. the transcription directions are the same for all members of the rat ugt2b cluster, and are also the same for members of the rat ugt2a genes. however, the transcription directions for members of the ugt2b cluster are not the same in the human and mouse genomes .

the evolutionary relationships of the ugt2b genes are shown as an unrooted phylogenetic tree . the human ugt2b genes display paralogous relationships while members of the mouse and rat ugt2b clusters display both paralogous and orthologous relationships. for example, the mouse ugt2b <dig> and ugt2b <dig> appears to be orthologous to the rat ugt2b <dig> and ugt2b <dig>  respectively. however, the rat ugt2b <dig> and ugt2b <dig> genes appear to be duplicated from an ancestral gene because they are very similar and are also located next to each other . the other mouse and rat ugt2b genes do not have orthologous relationships. the phylogenetic tree suggests that most human, mouse, and rat ugt2b genes are duplicated after speciation .

in summary, we analyzed the ugt <dig> loci in chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, baboon, dog, chicken, and zebrafish, and identified  <dig> new vertebrate ugt <dig> genes . phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the avian and mammalian ugt <dig> variable regions are expanded compared to zebrafish . we also performed a comprehensive analysis of the vertebrate gcnt <dig> cluster and identified  <dig> new gcnt <dig> genes , and found that the variable region of the gcnt <dig> cluster is also expanded during vertebrate evolution . finally, we analyzed the vertebrate ugt <dig> repertoires and found that, in contrast to ugt <dig> and gcnt <dig> clusters, the zebrafish ugt2a variable region has been expanded compared with mammals . these results suggest that these vertebrate variable exons are subject to lineage-specific birth-and-death evolution.

structure modeling of the vertebrate ugt proteins
the human ugt proteins allow our body to remove myriad endogenous metabolites and exogenous chemicals, such as steroids, bilirubin, bile acids, hormones, carcinogens, environmental toxicants, and therapeutic drugs  <cit> . understanding their structures will shed light on the substrate specificity  <cit> . however, the 3d structure information, either based on x-ray data or molecular modeling, is not available to date. there are currently five crystal structures of the gt-b family members . these structures are related although their primary sequences are divergent  <cit> . to comparatively model vertebrate ugt protein structures, we first aligned the bacterial and plant gt-b polypeptides based on their 3d structures. we then aligned this structure-based alignment to the human ugt1a <dig> sequence based on the predicted vertebrate ugt secondary structure profile. we also aligned  <dig> vertebrate ugt <dig> and  <dig> human, mouse, rat, and zebrafish ugt <dig> polypeptides. each of these translated  <dig> polypeptides has a signal peptide at the n-terminal and a 17-amino-acid  transmembrane segment close to the c-terminal with about  <dig> amino acids on the cytoplasmic side. the mature ugt proteins mostly reside in the lumen of the er  <cit> . the structure of the human ugt1a <dig> within the er lumen was modeled based on the alignment with ugt71g <dig> .

our modeled 3d structure is consistent with that the vertebrate ugt proteins belong to the gt-b superfamily of the inverting glycosyltransferases  <cit> . each modeled vertebrate ugt protein consists of two domains with similar core structure of rossmann folds  <cit> . as an example, the modeled 3d structure of the human ugt1a <dig> protein is shown in figure 4b. the n-terminal acceptor-binding domains of ugt <dig> proteins are each encoded by highly-similar variable exons in all vertebrate species . the c-terminal donor-binding domains of ugt <dig> proteins are identical in each species and are encoded by four constant exons . for ugt <dig> proteins, the acceptor-binding domains are encoded by first two exons which correspond to a single ugt <dig> variable exon, and the donor-binding domains are encoded by the last four exons  <cit> . the c-terminal domains of all vertebrate ugt proteins are highly conserved and assumed to bind the donor udpga  <cit> .

the n-terminal acceptor-binding domain of the modeled human ugt1a <dig> contains a central seven-parallel-strand β-pleated sheet with a topological arrangement of β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> . this core β sheet is flanked by  <dig> α helices. the first three β strands are connected by two α helices  on the same side of the β sheet as the nα <dig> helix, which is from the c-terminal sequences but is located below the last four β strands in the n-terminal domain. the other side of the core β sheet contains five helices with a topological arrangement of α <dig>  α <dig>  α5b, α <dig>  α <dig>  similar to the structure of ugt71g <dig>  there is a small two-stranded β sheet following the nα <dig> helix. in contrast to the structure of ugt71g <dig>  there is a flexible loop and a small predicted α helix following the nα <dig> helix . this segment is predicted to have different conformations among different human ugt proteins.

the c-terminal donor-binding domain contains a central six-parallel-strand β-pleated sheet with a topology arrangement of β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> . this β sheet core is flanked by  <dig> α helices with a topological arrangement of α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig> at one side of the β sheet and α <dig> and α <dig> at the other side of the β sheet, and α <dig> at the bottom. in contrast to ugt71g <dig>  the human ugt1a <dig> does not appear to have the cα <dig> helix. the last c-terminal α helix  is located at the bottom of the n-terminal domain. the two loops between nβ <dig> and cα <dig> and between cα <dig> and nα <dig> connect the n-terminal and c-terminal domains .

interactions between ugt proteins and the donor substrate
the donor substrate udpga for vertebrate ugt enzymes is predicted in our 3d model to bind in a long narrow channel mainly in the c-terminal rossmann-fold domain . in particular, the donor sits in a groove formed by the n-terminal half of the cα <dig> and cα <dig>  and the c-terminal half of the cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  in the modeled donor-ugt1a <dig> complex, the uracil ring of udpga interacts with the side chain of r <dig> and the main chain of l <dig> and q <dig> through hydrogen bonds, and also forms parallel stacking interaction with the indole ring of w <dig> of the human ugt1a <dig>  the ribose ring of udpga interacts with the side chain of q <dig>  n <dig>  and e <dig> through hydrogen bonds. the α-phosphate forms hydrogen bonds with the side chain of s <dig> and h <dig> and the main chain of h <dig> and g <dig>  while the β-phosphate interacts with the side chain of s <dig> and h <dig> and the main chain of s <dig> and g <dig>  finally, the glucuronic acid moiety interacts with the side chain and main chain of d <dig>  the main chain of s <dig>  and the side chain of q <dig> through hydrogen bonds . overall, the donor binding mode is similar to that observed in the complex of donor substrates with the gtfb, gtfd, murg, and ugt71g <dig> proteins  <cit> . in addition, this model of the donor recognition is consistent with the crucial role of the human ugt1a <dig> histidine, arginine, aspartic, and glutamic residues as demonstrated by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis experiments  <cit> .

the sequences of donor-binding region are highly conserved, especially for the donor-interacting residues. for example, the residues interacting with udpga are identical among all vertebrate ugt <dig> proteins and are almost identical among the ugt <dig> proteins . in addition, the residues located very close to udpga are also almost identical among the ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> proteins . previous studies have predicted that udpga binds to this region of ugt proteins  <cit> . however, the d <dig> of ugt1a <dig>  were predicted to interact with the uridyl moiety, an orientation different from the known gt-b donor complexes  <cit>  and our modeled donor-ugt1a <dig> interactions .

ugt proteins use udpga as a specific donor substrate  <cit> . in our modeled udpga ugt1a <dig> complex, the side chains of d <dig> and q <dig> interact with the glucuronic acid moiety. these two residues may play an important role in the specific recognition of donor molecule by the ugt proteins. consistently, q <dig> is conserved in all vertebrate ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> proteins . similarly, d <dig> is conserved in all vertebrate ugt <dig> proteins and all human ugt <dig> proteins. it is also conserved in mouse and rat ugt <dig> proteins with a few replaced by a glutamic residue.

missense mutations of human ugt1a <dig> cause hyperbilirubinemia, including type i and ii crigler-najjar syndromes  and the gilbert syndrome   <cit> . point mutations with amino acid substitutions a292v , g308e  <cit> , r336w  <cit> , r336q  <cit> , q357r  <cit> , a368t  <cit> , i370v  <cit> , s375f , s381r  <cit> , p387r  <cit> , p387s  <cit> , g395v  <cit> , or a401p  <cit>  cause the cn-i disease . moreover, the missense substitutions i294t  <cit> , m310v  <cit> , q331r  <cit> , r336l  <cit> , w354r  <cit> , h376r , g377v  <cit> , n400d  <cit>  or r403c  <cit>  cause the cn-ii disease . finally, point mutations of p364l  <cit> , or r367g  <cit>  cause the gilbert syndrome . these mutations are in the positions of highly conserved residues  in the donor-binding region . in particular, the residues g <dig>  m <dig>  r <dig>  w <dig>  q <dig>  s <dig>  h <dig>  g <dig>  s <dig>  g <dig>  n <dig>  and a <dig> are located very close to the donor in the modeled 3d structure of human ugt1a <dig> protein . their mutations may interfere with the donor binding, thus abolishing or decreasing the bilirubin glucuronidation activity of the human ugt1a <dig> protein and cause hyperbilirubinemia.

the ugt acceptor-binding site
bilirubin is highly lipophilic, unexcretable, and neurotoxic, and is known to have a stable ridge-tile conformation  <cit> . the human ugt1a <dig> is the only ugt <dig> enzyme for glucuronidating bilirubin acceptor substrate  <cit> . it catalyzes the transfer of the glucuronic acid moiety from udpga to the bilirubin c <dig> and c <dig> propionate groups . in the modeled human ugt1a <dig> structure, there is a deep kinked pocket adjacent to the donor-binding site . this pocket is formed mostly by the n-terminal domain. specifically, the wall of the pocket is formed by the n <dig> and n <dig> turns following the nβ <dig> and nβ <dig> strands, the nα <dig>  nα5b, nα <dig>  and nα5a helices . the floor of the pocket is formed by the nβ <dig> strand and the n <dig> turn following the nβ <dig> strand . the location of the pocket is similar to that of the substrate binding sites observed in the complex of the gtfa or gtfd with their corresponding acceptor substrates, and in the modeled acceptor-binding site of ugt71g <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this pocket is likely the acceptor-binding site of the human ugt1a <dig>  the glucuronic acid moiety of the donor in the modeled complex is oriented toward the middle of this acceptor-binding pocket.

we modeled the bilirubin binding using the molecular docking software gold  <cit> . the ridge-tile conformation of bilirubin is docked into the hydrophobic pocket with the ridge apposing the donor molecule in the c-terminal domain, and the porphyrin ring a in the one end and the porphyrin ring d in the other end of the n-terminal acceptor pocket . the propionate side groups are in the middle and close to the glucuronic acid moiety of the donor molecules. consistent with two glucuronidation sites in bilirubin through esterification of its two propionate side groups on the porphyrin rings b and c, there are two conformations that the bilirubin docked in the acceptor pocket , with each propionate side group docked close to the glucuronic acid moiety of the donor and the highly conserved catalytic residue h <dig>  there is a small tilt between the two bilirubin docking conformations. the acceptor-binding pocket is much larger and longer than bilirubin, and bilirubin can be fit easily into the pocket with one of its two propionate oh groups located at about  <dig> angstrom  from the ne <dig> atom of the h <dig> residue .

the acceptor-binding pocket of the human ugt1a <dig> is surrounded by mostly hydrophobic residues in the n-terminal domain, including p <dig>  v <dig>  a <dig>  l <dig>  y <dig>  g <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig>  g <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  l <dig>  a <dig>  l <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig>  and a <dig>  interestingly, most of these hydrophobic residues are highly diversified among paralogous members of the vertebrate ugt proteins and are located within four major hypervariable regions in the n-terminal domain . these four hypervariable regions form the wall and floor of the acceptor-binding pocket in the n-terminal domain . analogous to the recognition of antigens by hypervariable regions of the ig, tcr, and mhc proteins, we propose that these hypervariable regions play an important role in the recognition of numerous aglycone-acceptor substrates by vertebrate ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> proteins.

missense mutations of p34q  <cit> , h39d  <cit> , w40r  <cit> , g71r  <cit> , f83l  <cit> , l131p , c156r  <cit> , l175q  <cit> , c177r  <cit> , c177y  <cit> , q185p  <cit> , r209w  <cit> , v225g , p229q  <cit> , and g276r  <cit>  in human ugt1a <dig> protein cause hyperbilirubinemia . the p <dig>  h <dig>  and w <dig> residues are located in the acceptor-binding pocket and are also close to the donor substrate . the other mutated residues are mostly located in the four major hypervariable regions that form the acceptor-binding pocket. therefore, these mutations may interfere with the binding of bilirubin to human ugt1a <dig> and abolish or decrease its bilirubin glucuronidating activity, consistent with the hyperbilirubinemia phenotypes. interestingly, the ugt1a <dig> g71r mutation is almost exclusively found in asians and has recently been shown to associate with severe cancer drug  toxicity  <cit> , consistent with the altered acceptor recognition.

catalytic mechanism of vertebrate ugt glucuronidation
vertebrate ugt proteins belong to the gt-b inverting glycosyltransferase supergene family   <cit> . however, little is known about their catalytic mechanisms. in our modeled human ugt1a <dig> structure with the donor udpga and acceptor bilirubin substrates, the ne <dig> atom of the h <dig> residue lies in the middle of the potential acceptor pocket and is close to both the oh group of the bilirubin propionate side group  and the c1' atom of udpga , suggesting a general sn <dig> catalytic mechanism for glucuronidation reactions .

we propose that the h <dig> of human ugt1a <dig> acts as a general base to abstract a proton from the oh group of the bilirubin propionate, based on the crystal structures of other gt-b enzymes  <cit> . a direct attack by the resulting nucleophilic oxyanion at the c1' atom of udpga would then displace the udp moiety. consistent with the essential role of h <dig>  it is highly conserved in vertebrate ugt proteins . in addition, an h39d mutation in human ugt1a <dig> gene causes cn-i disease  <cit> , consistent with the complete abolishment of the catalytic activity for bilirubin glucuronidation .

in the modeled human ugt1a <dig> structure, there is an acidic d <dig> residue close to h <dig> that may form an electron transfer chain to help h <dig> deprotonate the oh group of the acceptor molecule . this aspartic acid residue is also highly conserved in vertebrate ugt proteins in agreement with its essential role in catalysis . thus, our modeled human ugt1a <dig> 3d structure is consistent with genetic mutation data and provides a foundation for understanding the catalytic mechanism of vertebrate glucuronidation.

diversifying selection of vertebrate ugt clusters
enormous molecular diversity is required for the immune and nervous system function. in the adaptive immune system, positive molecular selection operates to increase the diversity of the ig, mhc, and tcr genes  <cit> . in the cns, adaptive molecular selection also operates to enhance the diversity of the pcdh and olfactory receptor gene clusters  <cit> . human ugt proteins glucuronidate numerous endogenous substrates including steroids and bile acids, as well as diverse xenobiotic chemicals such as environmental carcinogens and therapeutic drugs  <cit> . gene duplication and birth-and-death evolution are major sources of ugt diversity in the vertebrate evolution . we hypothesize that positive selection may be an additional factor to enhance the diversity of vertebrate ugt genes.

we searched for positively selected sites in ugt genes for various vertebrate species using the maximum-likelihood codeml program  <cit> . we ran three pairs of nested codeml models on the human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, baboon, dog, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish clusters a and b ugt <dig> genes, as well as the human, mouse, and rat ugt <dig> genes to infer positively selected codon sites. the parameter estimates for the ugt genes are shown in the additional file  <dig>  the positively selected ω+ sites in each repertoire are shown in the additional file  <dig>  different vertebrate species have overlapping but distinct ω+ site profiles for the ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> genes, even between very closely-related lineages such as mice and rats , suggesting that these ugt genes in different species are evolved through different chemical environments.

based on the structural alignment in the figure 4a, we aligned the polypeptide sequence of ugt71g <dig> to those of the human , chimpanzee , rhesus monkey , baboon , dog , mouse , rat , chicken , and zebrafish clusters a  and b  ugt <dig> variable-exon-encoded polypeptides, as well as the corresponding human , mouse , and rat  ugt <dig> proteins. we then mapped the positively-selected vertebrate ugt ω+ sites onto the crystal structure of ugt71g <dig>  <cit>  on the basis of these alignments . interestingly, almost all positively selected sites are located within the four vertebrate ugt hypervariable regions and map to the acceptor-binding pocket of the ugt71g <dig> crystal structure. thus, these residues may participate in the recognition of diverse acceptor molecules by vertebrate ugt proteins. this observation suggests that nature selection operates to increase the diversity of vertebrate ugt proteins.

evolution of multiple variable first exons and ugt diversity
we showed that the variable and constant organizations of ugt <dig>  gcnt <dig>  and ugt2a clusters are vertebrate-specific . in addition, these clusters are mainly subject to birth-and-death evolution instead of concerted evolution because there is no prevalent gene conversion . finally, nature selection at specific residues in four hypervariable regions in the ugt acceptor-binding domain increases their diversity for binding numerous environmental agents . interestingly, a recent human population genetic study found that diversified coding sites are more likely to be polymorphic than conserved sites  <cit> .

in the vertebrate cns, birth-and-death evolution of pcdh variable exon arrays and positive selection on their specific ectodomain codons contribute to the staggering diversity required for neuronal connectivity  <cit> . in the vertebrate adaptive immune system, dna rearrangement of variable and constant gene segments in the ig and tcr clusters, in conjunction with birth-and-death evolution and positive selection, generate unlimited diversity. highly polymorphic mhc genes also undergo birth-and-death evolution and overdominant selection  <cit> . in particular, positive selection at hypervariable regions or cdrs of ig, tcr, and mhc proteins enhances their diversity for binding numerous antigens  <cit> . in the vertebrate detoxification system, ugt proteins recognize a myriad of hydrophobic aglycone molecules and each ugt has distinct but broad overlapping substrate specificities  <cit> . similar to the nervous and immune systems, two factors contribute to the diversity of ugt proteins for defense against small chemicals. the duplication of ugt <dig> variable exons and the entire ugt <dig> genes increases the number of distinct vertebrate ugt proteins . in addition, the diversified residues in hypervariable regions through positive selection contribute to the binding specificity of each vertebrate ugt protein for a large set of distinct aglycones . thus, our results reveal an intriguing similarity of diversification mechanisms between vertebrate nervous, immune, and chemical defense systems.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability of ugt enzymes to glucuronidate numerous endobiotics and xenobiotics is conferred by their unusual genomic organization and structure diversity. each ugt <dig> variable exon is preceded by a distinct promoter. a highly conserved dna motif located at about the same position upstream from each variable exon is likely to play an important role in regulating ugt <dig> gene expression . the combination of specific promoter activation and alternative cis-splicing of a variable exon to constant exons determines their tissue-specific expression. comparative modeling of all ugt proteins suggests that each has di-domain rossmann folds with a hydrophobic acceptor-binding pocket located within the n-terminal domain. maximum-likelihood analysis of nt substitution patterns identified positively selected residues located in four hypervariable regions of the n-terminal domain . structural modeling suggests that these hypervariable regions form the hydrophobic acceptor-binding pocket . therefore, highly diversified residues in the acceptor-binding pocket could enable different ugt <dig> proteins to have distinct glucuronidation profiles for a large repertoire of environmental agents. our comparative sequences analysis and homologous modeling shed light on the evolution of multiple variable exons and provide a framework for future structural and biochemical characterization of the vertebrate ugt proteins.
