BACKGROUND
thiamine and its phosphorylated derivatives are common cellular constituents in all living forms studied so far  <cit> . while the role of thiamine diphosphate  as a cofactor for more than  <dig> enzymes is well documented  <cit> , we have so far little information concerning the possible role of other thiamine derivatives.

no known biological role has been documented for thiamine monophosphate , but recent results suggest a role for thiamine triphosphate . although it is only a minor component  of total thiamine in most tissues, thtp was found in all organisms investigated so far  <cit> . in plants and in bacteria, the appearance of thtp seems to be a response to specific conditions of cellular stress  <cit> . in e. coli for instance, the initial accumulation of thtp appears to be required for optimal growth in media containing a carbon source but no amino acids.

recently, we identified a new thiamine derivative, adenosine thiamine triphosphate . this compound was first discovered in e. coli, but it is also present in low amounts in plants and animals  <cit> . like thtp, athtp appears to be a signal produced in bacteria in response to some form of cellular stress; however, the two compounds are formed under different conditions and generally do not accumulate simultaneously. both are hardly detectable when the bacteria are grown in rich media under optimal conditions. when the bacteria are transferred to minimal m <dig> medium, athtp appears in the absence of any carbon source and it quickly disappears when glucose is added, suggesting that it is produced in response to carbon starvation. in contrast, thtp synthesis requires the presence of an energy substrate such as glucose.

although the presence of thtp in many tissues has been known for over  <dig> years, the mechanism of its enzymatic synthesis remains unclear. in particular, no significant net synthesis of thtp could be detected so far using cell-free extracts of e. coli. in contrast, we observed a synthesis of athtp from adp and thdp in soluble fractions from sonicated bacteria. here, we describe the partial purification and some kinetic properties of a high molecular weight enzyme  catalyzing the synthesis of athtp in e. coli.

RESULTS
partial purification of athtp-synthesizing enzyme from e. coli
e. coli  were grown aerobically overnight in lb medium either in a  <dig> l fermentor  under constant aeration  and agitation  or in  <dig> liter flasks . the cells were sedimented , suspended in  <dig> ml of minimal m <dig> medium containing  <dig> mm glucose and incubated for  <dig> min . bacteria were collected by centrifugation , suspended in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris-hcl buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig>  mm edta,  <dig>  mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,  <dig>  m kcl, and frozen at -20°c. after thawing the suspension was sonicated , the pellet was removed by centrifugation , and the supernatant was used as a source for enzyme purification.

the extract was placed in a water bath  under continuous stirring and heated to 50°c. after  <dig> min, the sample was placed on ice, cooled to 4°c and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation . the supernatant was concentrated to  <dig>  ml with centriplus  <dig> centrifugal filter units  and run on a sephadex g- <dig> column  calibrated with protein size standards. the chromatography was carried out in  <dig> mm tris-hcl buffer, ph  <dig> , containing  <dig>  mm edta and  <dig>  m nacl, at a flow rate of  <dig> cm . hr- <dig>  and 4-ml fractions were collected. athtp-synthesizing activity was eluted in two nearly equal peaks, corresponding to molecular masses of  <dig> ±  <dig> kda and  <dig> ±  <dig> kda . the first peak was used for subsequent kinetic studies. the purification data are summarized in table  <dig>  fig.  <dig> shows the synthesis of athtp in the high molecular mass fraction.

the purification factor was calculated by comparing the activity in a given fraction to the activity found in the extract.

kinetic properties
as shown in fig.  <dig>  under standard conditions, athtp synthesis was not linear with time. instead, we observed a pronounced lag period in the accumulation of product, allowing no initial rate measurements to be made. the duration of the lag period, τ, as determined by extrapolation of the linear part of the curve to the time axis, was about  <dig>  hour.

the influence of hydrogen ion concentration on the enzyme activity was examined at ph values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . acetate , maleate , tris-maleate , tris-hcl  and bis-tris-propane  buffers were used in the assay mixture. as can be seen in fig.  <dig>  the enzyme has a ph optimum of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and there is clearly an inhibitory effect of bis-tris-propane on the enzyme activity.

the effect of thdp concentration on the reaction rate was studied within the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> mm at a fixed adp concentration of  <dig> mm. the reaction followed michaelis-menten kinetics giving a hyperbolic saturation curve  with an apparent km value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  obtained from the direct plot using non-linear regression. extrapolation from the hanes plot gave a value of  <dig>  mm .

fig.  <dig> illustrates the effect of increasing adp concentrations on the rate of athtp synthesis at a fixed concentration of thdp . in contrast to the effect of thdp concentration, varying the adp concentration did not yield michealis-menten kinetics but a sigmoid curve was observed. an s <dig>  value of  <dig>  mm was estimated, indicating that the apparent affinity of the active sites for adp is rather high. the nh coefficient calculated from the hill plot  was  <dig> , in agreement with the possibility of two cooperative binding sites for adp.

no measurable athtp synthesis was observed in the absence of divalent metal ions. among the cations tested , mn2+ was the most efficient; mg2+ was  <dig> % less effective, whereas no measurable athtp synthesis was observed in the presence of ca2+. the effect of varying mg2+ concentrations on the reaction rate was explored at a fixed thdp concentration of  <dig>  mm and adp concentration of  <dig> mm. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the saturation curve was sigmoid when total mg2+ concentrations were used. this sigmoidicity did not disappear completely when free mg2+ concentrations ; free mg2+ concentration .

substrate specificity
various combinations of substrates were tested: adp + thmp, adp + thdp, adp + thtp, atp + thmp, atp + thdp, atp + thtp. among the thiamine phosphates, the enzyme exhibited an absolute specificity for thdp, whereas both adp and atp could serve as the second substrate, the rate of athtp synthesis being essentially equal with either substrate . our preparation contained no significant atp hydrolyzing activity, excluding that the activity observed in the presence of atp was due to its hydrolysis to adp. no peaks corresponding to a newly synthesized compound were observed on chromatograms when adp was replaced by gdp, cdp or udp. there was also no synthesis of compounds such as diadenosine phosphates when a single substrate such as adp or atp was used . thdp alone did not appear to be transformed either.

discussion
athtp has recently been discovered in e. coli, where it accumulates as a result of carbon starvation  <cit> . here, we describe for the first time the existence, the partial purification and the kinetic properties of an athtp-synthesizing enzyme. the activity was low in e. coli extracts :  <dig>  pmol·min-1·mg- <dig> of protein under standard incubation conditions. we tried to concentrate the enzyme, by using different precipitation procedures, including ammonium sulfate, acetone, polyethylene glycol and isoelectric point precipitation, but all of them were unsuccessful; each time a 5–10-fold reduction in enzyme activity was observed. we considered that this loss of activity could be due either to inactivation of the enzyme or to the removal of an essential activator. it seems that both factors are important. we found that addition of a boiled bacterial extract to the incubation medium containing salted-out enzyme led to 40–50% increase in the reaction rate , suggesting the requirement for an activator, whose chemical nature remains unknown, though it seems to be a low molecular weight compound resistant to heating. recent studies show an important accumulation of camp and phosphoenolpyruvate during carbon starvation  <cit> , but none had an activating effect on athtp synthesis .

nevertheless, even in the presence of the activator, the specific activity of the enzyme preparation remained low. we faced the same problem testing conventional adsorption chromatography methods and resins – phenyl-sepharose, deae-sephacel, blue-sepharose, 2',5'adp-sepharose and hydroxyapatite. each time, the activity was lost after chromatography.

it should be noted that this loss of activity was not the consequence of proteolysis or unfavorable buffer composition, as the extract could be kept at +4°c for several days without any significant loss of activity. moreover, the use of common protective reagents such as glycerol or dithiothreitol did not lead to increased enzyme recovery. it seems that the athtp-synthesizing enzyme is extremely sensitive to any separation by procedures based on precipitation or adsorption. on the other hand, this enzyme was rather resistant to heating and liquid-liquid chromatography such as gel filtration. therefore, we set up a procedure for the partial purification in two steps, heat treatment and gel filtration on sephadex-g- <dig> 

during the gel-filtration step, two peaks of activity were eluted from the column, with molecular masses of  <dig> and  <dig> kda respectively. it should be noted that the respective peak areas depended on the experimental conditions, especially on the time of sample processing and protein concentration, the high molecular mass peak being predominant in most cases. one may suppose that these peaks correspond to aggregated and dissociated forms of the enzyme, based on the ratio of their molecular masses. the effect of adp concentration  gave a sigmoid curve with a hill coefficient around  <dig>  which is in agreement with the assumption that the 355-kda enzyme complex contains two cooperative subunits.

the athtp-synthesizing enzyme also appears to undergo time-dependent reorganization. as shown in fig.  <dig>  it took several hours before the activity reached a steady-state, pointing to slow conformational changes in the molecular structure of the enzyme. such a behavior is characteristic of a special class of allosteric enzymes capable of slow association-dissociation processes induced by substrate, ligands or protein concentration  <cit> . it is possible that further dissociation of the  <dig> kda species into smaller subunits is responsible for the low stability of the athtp-synthesizing enzyme during precipitation and adsorption procedures, indicating a weak binding between its subunits.

the partially purified enzyme exhibited a maximal activity at ph  <dig> – <dig>  , the enzyme being active in a rather broad range of ph. the enzyme is sensitive to the nature of the buffer as well as the buffer concentration. at ph  <dig> , for example, the activity in  <dig> mm maleate was  <dig>  times higher than in  <dig> mm bis-tris-propane, and the latter, in turn, was  <dig>  times higher than in the  <dig> mm bis-tris-propane.

the enzyme showed hyperbolic saturation with respect to thdp concentration at a fixed adp concentration, with an apparent km of approximately  <dig> mm . though this is a very high value compared to the free intracellular thdp concentration in bacteria  <cit> , it has a physiological meaning. indeed, under such conditions  the reaction follows first order kinetics with respect to thdp: the more thdp is available, the more athtp can be synthesized. this could explain why in intact bacteria, athtp accumulates during carbon starvation  <cit> . in this situation, where catabolic processes become prevalent, cellular proteins are degraded, probably leading to the dissociation of enzyme-bound thdp and a substantial increase in the cytosolic concentration of free thdp.

on the other hand, a sigmoid saturation curve, a typical feature of allosteric enzymes, was obtained for adp at a fixed thdp concentration . this might indicate a regulatory mechanism. however, adp concentration in bacterial cells is around  <dig> mm  <cit>  indicating that the enzyme is saturated under normal physiological conditions.

the enzyme has an absolute dependence on divalent metal ions such as mg2+or mn2+. a sigmoid saturation curve was observed when the rate of athtp synthesis was plotted against the total mg2+ concentration . as mg2+ is known to form complexes with polyphosphates, the concentration of free mg2+ is not equal to its total concentration and this could explain the reason for the sigmoid behavior. indeed, if we replace total mg2+ by free mg2+ concentration estimated from the dissociation constant of  <dig> μm  <cit>  for the mg- adp- complex, the shape of the plot becomes less sigmoid . in addition, complexes with thdp  and buffer ions  are also generated, leading to a further decrease in free mg2+ content, especially in the range of its low concentrations. it is thus likely that there are no cooperative effects of mg2+ ions.

this enzyme is highly specific for thdp among thiamine phosphates, but it is able to use both atp and adp as the second substrate. as athtp is synthesized only under conditions of carbon starvation  <cit> , i.e. when atp content is low, adp is probably the physiologically relevant substrate. the replacement of adp  by gdp, udp or cdp gave no product formation. it could be argued that, as the apparent affinity for thdp is low, thdp might not be the physiological substrate. an obvious possibility is that the real substrate is a second adp molecule instead of thdp. an analogous phenomenon has been reported in the case of adenylate kinase 1: thdp can replace adp at one site but is a much poorer substrate  <cit> . if this were the case for our enzyme an important synthesis of diadenosine triphosphate should be observed with adp as the sole substrate, but this was not the case. moreover, the synthesis of athtp should be impaired when adp is in excess over thdp. however, data in fig.  <dig> show that there is no tendency to inhibition of athtp synthesis by excess adp. those data strongly suggest that adp does not bind to the thdp-binding site with high affinity. this does not exclude, however, that some unknown substrate might replace thdp.

concerning the correct systematic name of athtp-synthesizing enzyme, it should belong to ec subgroup of  <dig> . <dig> of nucleotidyl transferases as a nucleotidyl moiety is transferred to thdp. subgroup  <dig> . <dig> comprises a set of enzymes carrying out a nucleotidyl transfer and release of inorganic phosphate  or pyrophosphate : x- p- p + p- y ⇔ x- p- p- y + p. correspondingly, the athtp-synthesizing enzyme could be named adp : thiamine diphosphate adenylyl transferase . as both adp and atp can act as substrates, we recommend the name of thdp adenylyl transferase .

CONCLUSIONS
the discovery of a new thiamine compound, athtp  <cit> , as well as of its synthesizing enzyme in the present study, along with the recent findings concerning thtp  <cit>  and the discovery of riboswitches  <cit>  underline the great diversity of thiamine biochemistry and is strongly in favor of one or several non-cofactor roles of thiamine derivatives in living organisms.
