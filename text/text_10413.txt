BACKGROUND
drought is one of the most adverse environment stress factors that negatively affects plant growth and development, which adversely leads to the yield losses of major crops worldwide every year  <cit> . of the  <dig>  billion hectares of global cropland, only  <dig> % were irrigated that provides about  <dig> % of the world’s food production, whereas the remaining  <dig> % was provided by rain-fed agriculture. wheat  as the world’s most important cereal crop is grown in a large range of latitudes worldwide under both irrigated and rain-fed conditions and thus in conditions subjected to drought. wheat is considered as an excellent system to study drought tolerance in spite of its genetic complexity  <cit> . recently, the completion of chromosome-based draft sequencing of hexaploid bread wheat genome will accelerate wheat breeding and identification of key genes controlling complex traits in response to drought  <cit> . based on the wheat genome sequencing data, much research effort would be applied to gain better understanding of mechanisms adopted by wheat to combat drought stress.

to date, some physiological and molecular mechanisms of plants to cope with drought stress have been extensively described by many researchers. when plants are subjected to drought stress, an early response is the rapid closure of stomata triggered by aba for decreasing water loss from leaves  <cit> . the transient increases of aba level under water deficit condition can also trigger many downstream stress responses  <cit> . two major responses have emerged in terms of cellular and molecular basis in coping with drought. first, the initial response is closely related to osmotic adjustment  <cit> . the accumulated osmolytes include proline, glutamate, glycine-betaine and sugars , which play a key role in preventing membrane disintegration and enzyme inactivation under drought stress  <cit> . second, a large number of drought-responsive genes and specific protective proteins were induced for drought tolerance  <cit> . these drought stress-related transcripts and proteins are mostly involved in signalling transduction and activation/regulation of transcription, antioxidants and reactive oxygen species  scavengers  <cit> . most of the important transcription regulon in drought-induced aba signalling pathways have been identified, such as dehydration-responsive element binding protein , c-repeat-binding factor , aba-responsive element binding protein , aba-binding factor , myelocytomatosis oncogene  and myeloblastosis oncogene  . dreb and cbf function in aba-independent gene expression, whereas areb, abf, myc and myb function in aba-dependent gene expression  <cit> . in wheat, stress-inducible expression of tadreb <dig> and tadreb <dig> genes demonstrated substantial resistance to drought stress  <cit> . over-expression of tanac <dig> leads to enhanced transcript levels of stress up-regulated genes and dehydration tolerance in bread wheat  <cit> . a myb gene from wheat, tamybsdu <dig>  is up-regulated under drought stress and differentially regulated between tolerant and sensitive genotypes  <cit> . for the ros-scavenging pathways, the deleterious effects of ros under drought stress need to be quickly scavenged to protect cells from oxidative damage. some antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase , catalase , ascorbate peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase  and glutathione s-transferase , are responsible for ros-scavenging  <cit> . drought-induced up-regulation of these proteins suggested the presence of well-equipped antioxidant system in plant cells to cope with drought stress  <cit> . apart from antioxidants, accumulation of molecular chaperons  helps in refolding of misfolded proteins  <cit> . in addition, inducible synthesis of dehydrin  proteins further provides protection to membranes against dehydration damage  <cit> . the association between accumulation of dhn family members and drought tolerance has been shown in some species, such as wheat  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , gentian  <cit>  and white clover  <cit> .

despite intensive studies on drought-responsive mechanisms in plants , drought tolerance mechanisms remain largely unknown due to a complex nature of the quantitative trait. it is known that different cultivars within a crop species may greatly differ in their response and adaptation to drought stress  <cit> . the information available on the molecular basis of drought tolerance in different wheat genotypes is still limited. previous studies at transcriptomic level have revealed that the drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat genotypes can adopt different molecular strategies to cope with drought stress . one of the main differences is the differential expression of some drought-inducible genes for protection , regulation  and remodelling   <cit> . a large number of these well-known drought-related genes can often be activated in drought-sensitive wheat genotype, while the tolerant genotype shows the constitutive expression of several genes activated by drought in sensitive genotype, which might contribute to limit drought effect and perception  <cit> . in addition, signal transduction and hormone-dependent regulation pathways are also different in different wheat genotypes  <cit> . the drought-tolerant genotype can quickly sense drought and trigger the signal transduction pathways for activation of downstream elements for survival from drought stress. the differential expression of phospholipase c gene involved in inositol- <dig>   <dig>  5-triphosphate  signalling and mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade elements has been reported in two contrasting wheat genotypes  <cit> . some transcription factors also have unique responses to drought stress in different wheat genotypes, suggesting differences in hormone-dependent regulation pathways. a drought-tolerant wheat genotype has been reported to show induction of bzip and hd-zip gene known as transcription factors relevant to aba regulatory pathway under drought stress, whereas the sensitive genotype induced transcription factors that bind to ethylene responsive elements  <cit> . although these studies have provided important insights to some extent, the data at transcriptional level are always insufficient to predict protein expression due to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation mechanisms  <cit> . there is far less information available on the functional products of these identified genes, leading to poor knowledge of correlations between transcriptomes and proteomes in drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat genotypes under drought stress.

proteomics has become the most direct and powerful tool to obtain protein expression information of plants in response to drought stress  <cit> . it can provide the global protein expression profile encoded by genome, thereby complementing transcriptomic studies  <cit> . comparative proteomics of drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat genotypes is a strategy to understand the complexity of molecular mechanism of wheat in response to drought stress. recently, a few published studies have been applied to describe proteome changes in different wheat genotypes under drought stress . a small set of drought-inducible proteins was also identified from these studies in various wheat organs including seedling leaves, stems, roots and grains. differential expression of these proteins in different wheat genotypes may be responsible for the stronger drought resistance of tolerant genotypes. although these studies have provided some insight into the molecular mechanisms of different wheat genotypes in response to drought stress, the limited information cannot be enough to establish the possible drought-responsive proteins network for explaining the different drought-responsive strategy in drought-tolerant and sensitive genotypes. furthermore, it is conceivable that there may be many novel drought-inducible proteins yet to be identified in previous studies. thus, our observations attempt to extend findings regarding the potential proteomic dynamics in drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat genotypes under drought stress and to enrich the research content of drought tolerance mechanism.

in the present study, a comparative proteomics approach was applied to investigate the molecular events of two wheat cultivars in response to drought stress, xihan no.  <dig>  and longchun  <dig> , respectively. the differentially abundant proteins including well-known and novel drought-responsive proteins were identified in two cultivars under drought stress using 2-de coupled with maldi-tof/tof ms and mascot database searching. the findings will help drive further work to develop strategies for improving drought tolerance and water use efficiency of wheat, and to gain comprehensive knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in drought response.

2-de 
the first dimension of the isoelectric focusing  was performed using  <dig> cm immobilised ph gradients  strips  with ph gradients 3– <dig> in protean ief cell system . the ipg strips were rehydrated overnight with  <dig> μg of total proteins diluted in rehydration buffer  to reach a final volume of  <dig> μl. after rehydration, the focusing was performed at  <dig> °c using the following settings:  <dig> v during  <dig> h, gradient to  <dig> v during  <dig>  h, gradient to  <dig>  <dig> v in  <dig> h, gradient to  <dig>  <dig> v in  <dig> h,  <dig>  <dig> v until  <dig>  <dig> vh. prior to second dimension electrophoresis, the ipg strips were equilibrated at room temperature for  <dig> min in  <dig> ml of equilibration buffer , and subsequently for  <dig> min in the same buffer but  <dig>  %  iodoacetamide replacing dtt. the equilibrated strips were loaded and run on  <dig> % sds-page gels using proteanii xi cell system  with a programmable power controller. the gels were run for  <dig> min at  <dig> v, then at constant voltage  <dig> v until the dye front reached the bottom of gel. the separated proteins were visualized by coomassie brilliant blue  g- <dig> staining. for each protein sample, three replicates were run for each gel to ascertain reproducibility.

image acquisition and data analysis
the cbb-stained 2-de gels were scanned with a umax powerlook 2100xl-usb scanner  at  <dig> bits per pixel and scan resolution of  <dig> dpi in a transmission mode. image analysis was subsequently carried out with pdquest v <dig> . <dig> software , including background subtraction, spot detection, spot measurement and spot matching. the gel image of control was selected as a reference gel to align with gel image of dehydration  and rehydration , respectively. the abundance of one protein spot was expressed as the volume of that spot which was defined as the sum of the intensities of all the pixels that make up that spot. to minimize possible errors due to differences in the amount of protein loaded and the staining intensity, the spot abundance was normalised as a percentage of the total spot volume in the gel. the normalised percentage volume  of protein spots from triplicate biological samples were subjected to statistical analysis using means ± standard error . at least nine images derived from three biological replicates of each treatment were compared, which were obtained in the same experimental set. we used one-way analyses of variance  to evaluate the significance  of protein differential expression. only spots with statistical significance  and reproducible changes were considered, and the spots with an abundance ratio at least  <dig> -fold in relative abundance were selected as differentially abundant proteins. these spots were then selected for protein identification using maldi-tof/tof ms.

tryptic digestion
spots with significantly differential expression from 2-de gels were carefully excised. gel spots were washed twice for  <dig> min with deionized water, and then destained and dehydrated with acetonitrile . after washed twice for  <dig> min at room temperature with vigorous shaking in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % acn containing  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate, the gel spots were incubated overnight with  <dig> μl of  <dig> % acn and then dried. proteins were digested for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c in  <dig> μl of  <dig> ng/μl trypsin solution. the supernatant was collected, and the fluid was further extracted twice from gel spots with  <dig> μl of  <dig> % acn containing  <dig> % trifluoroacetic acid  for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c. finally, all the extractions were pooled with the trypsin supernatant and dried.

protein identification by maldi-tof/tof ms
for maldi-tof/tof ms, digested protein samples were mixed  with the matrix solution , and then  <dig>  μl of this mixture was spotted on the maldi target. tryptic peptides were analysed using an abi  <dig> plus maldi-tof/tof™ analyzer . the ms spectra were recorded in the positive reflector mode in a mass range from  <dig> to  <dig> with a focus mass of  <dig>  for one main ms spectrum  <dig> subspectra with  <dig> shots per subspectrum were accumulated using a random search pattern. ms was used a calmix <dig> standard to calibrate the instrument . for ms calibration, autolysis peaks of trypsin  were used as internal calibrates, and up to  <dig> of the most intense ion signals were selected as precursors for ms/ms acquisition, excluding the trypsin autolysis peaks and the matrix ion signals. in ms/ms positive-ion mode, for one main ms spectrum  <dig> subspectra with  <dig> shots per subspectrum were accumulated using a random search pattern. collision energy was 1-kv, collision gas was air, and default calibration was set by using the glu1-fibrino-peptide b  spotted onto cal  <dig> positions of the maldi target. both the ms and ms/ms data were integrated and extracted using gps explore v <dig>  software . peptides were identified by searching for taxonomy  in the ncbinr database  <dig>  using mascot v <dig>  search engine . the parameters for searching were: enzyme equals trypsin; one missed cleavage; allowed variable oxidation modifications ; allowed fixed modifications of carbamidomethyl ; peptide mass tolerance of  <dig> ppm; fragment mass tolerance of  <dig>  da. the significance threshold  was set using the mascot algorithm.

functional classification and hierarchical clustering analysis
the functional classification of the identified proteins was conducted according to the putative functions assigned to each of the candidates using the protein function database. a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed by using the multi experiment viewer  software . the data were taken in terms of -fold expression with respect to the control expression value. then, the data sets were log-transformed to the base  <dig> to level the scale of expression and reduce the noise. only the clusters with n >  <dig> were taken to investigate the co-expression patterns for functionally similar proteins.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was carried out with three biological replicates for proteomic and physiological analyses. the repeated measurement was given as means ± standard error . the results of spot abundance and physiological data were statistically evaluated by one-way analyses of variance  and the duncan’s multiple range test to determine the significant difference among group means. in all cases, significance was defined as p <  <dig> .

discussion
drought is the most important limiting factor for wheat production, and it is becoming an increasingly severe problem in northwestern regions of china. in addition to the complexity of drought itself, the responses of different wheat genotype to drought are complex. the different mechanisms are adopted by wheat genotype with different drought tolerance when they encounter drought stress. the present research about physiology and comparative proteomics in two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance will help to establish the precise screening techniques to identify traits which are related to drought tolerance in wheat.

metabolism-related proteins
drought can often cause significant metabolism alteration in plants so as to produce some important metabolic intermediates and more energy against drought stress  <cit> . several key enzymes involved in glycolysis pathway were up-regulated under drought stress, that is, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  in xihan no.  <dig>  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase a , triosephosphate isomerase  and enolase  <dig>  in longchun  <dig>  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  is responsible for the interconversion of  <dig> -diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a central step in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis  <cit> . the up-regulation of gapdh in both two wheat cultivars can promote glucose metabolism to meet the increased substance and energy requirement for drought resistance as suggested by rochat et al.  <cit> . triosephosphate isomerase  catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is essential for efficient energy production in glycolysis  <cit> . the up-regualtion of tpi  in longchun  <dig> is consistent with the observation in rice and maize under drought stress  <cit> . enolase  <dig>  catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, which has been reported in response to salt, drought, cold and anaerobic stress  <cit> . it suggested that the strengthened glycolysis pathway can lead to acetyl-coa accumulation in krebs cycle and finally produce a large amount of atp for drought resistance. malate dehydrogenase  associated with krebs cycle was also up-regulated during the early period of drought stress in longchun  <dig>  which might accelerate krebs cycle for drought adaption  <cit> . in addition, two crucial enzymes in pentose phosphate pathway , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenate  and transketolase , were up-regulated in longchun  <dig>  it was most likely that ppp may be another pathway for producing more energy in response to drought  <cit> . such a number of regulated glucose metabolism-related enzymes in longchun  <dig> reflected an increased energy requirement in drought-sensitive cultivar than tolerant cultivar under drought stress.

drought can cause changes in free amino acid levels in plant cells  <cit> . there were several amino acid biosynthesis-related enzymes affected by drought stress in two wheat cultivars. glutamine synthetase  is responsible for the first step of ammonium assimilation and transformation into glutamine and proline  precursors  <cit> . the up-regulated plastid glutamine synthetase isoform gs2c  in xihan no.  <dig> can lead to proline accumulation and enhance osmotic adjustment ability of cells under drought stress as suggested by díaz et al.  <cit> . it appeared that proline biosynthesis may be an important amino acid metabolism strategy against drought in drought-tolerant cultivar. s-adenosylmethionine synthase  catalyzes a conjugation of methionine and atp to generate sam  <cit> . previous study has reported that sams plays a role in betaine  biosynthesis induced by drought  <cit>  and promotes lignin accumulation for the rearrangement and reinforcement of cell wall  <cit> . the up-regulated sams  <dig>  in longchun  <dig> during the early period of drought stress may contribute to the early protection mechanism against drought through osmolyte accumulation or an accelerated formation of vascular tissue and aerenchyma.

there were also other metabolism-related enzymes providing additional information for wheat in response to drought stress. previous studies have found that acid phosphatase  activity was increased under low phosphorus stress . the up-regulation of acid phosphatase  <dig>  in longchun  <dig> and putative acid phosphatase  in xihan no.  <dig> during the early period of drought stress indicated that phosphate metabolism may be a positive drought-response by promoting phosphate absorption, transport and utilization in wheat. aldehyde dehydrogenases  belong to a family of nad+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various toxic aldehydes to carboxylic acids  <cit> . the up-regulation of aldh family  <dig> member b <dig>  in longchun  <dig> during the early period of drought stress can decrease the toxicity of aldehyde supported from the report of sunkar et al.  <cit> . formate dehydrogenase  is a mitochondrial and nad-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide in plants  <cit> . previous study has demonstrated that fdh activity was highest in intact sprouting potato tubers under hypoxia stress  <cit> . the up-regulated fdh  in xihan no.  <dig> during the middle period of drought stress reflected its important role in anaerobic metabolism of drought-tolerant cultivar.

photosynthesis-related proteins
oxygen-evolving enhancer proteins  as an auxiliary component of photosystem ii  manganese cluster can control o <dig> evolution and maintain the stability of ps ii  <cit> . the gradually down-regulated oee 1– <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> and the rapidly down-regulated oee  <dig>  in longchun  <dig> under drought stress suggested that drought-tolerant cultivar have more stability of oxygen-evolving activity of ps ii. rubisco is a key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for photosynthetic carbon assimilation  <cit> . there were several down-regulated rubisco proteins found in two wheat cultivars, including ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase  large subunit , ribulose <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase activase isoform  <dig> , rubisco large subunit-binding protein subunit alpha  and subunit beta  in xihan no.  <dig> and rubisco large subunit , rubisco large subunit-binding protein subunit alpha , rubisco large subunit  and rbcl  in longchun  <dig>  it might be one of main non-stomatal factors for the decreased photosynthetic rate in two wheat cultivars under drought stress as suggested by galmés et al.  <cit> . fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphate aldolase  reversibly catalyzes the conversion of fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate  to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  and dihydroxy acetone 3-phosphate  <cit> . under stress condition, both gap and fbp may be converted to glucose 6-phosphate for re-entry into the ppp for nadph synthesis  <cit> . the down-regulation of fba  in xihan no.  <dig> can enhance nadph synthesis for energy and maintenance of calvin cycle. otherwise, some photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis-regulated enzymes were also identified in two wheat cultivars. protochlorophyllide reductase , catalyzing phototransformation of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide in chlorophyll biosynthesis  <cit> , was up regulated in xihan no.  <dig>  glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase  participating in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism  <cit>  and magnesium-protoporphyrin o-methyltransferase  involved in light-independent chlorophyll biosynthesis  <cit>  were up-regulated in longchun  <dig>  it suggested that the enhanced photosynthetic pigment synthesis might be a common mechanism in response to drought stress in both drought-tolerant and sensitive cultivars.

redox homeostasis-related proteins
plants have developed some antioxidative systems including various antioxidants and antioxidase to protect against oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species  under drought stress  <cit> . several antioxidases were found to be up-regulated in xihan no.  <dig> under drought stress, including glutathione transferase , glutathione peroxidase-like protein gpx54hv , peroxidase , probable l-ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  and manganese superoxide dismutase . glutathione transferases  as important detoxification enzymes catalyze the conjugation of xenobiotics or their metabolites to glutathione   <cit> . glutathione peroxidases  catalyze the reduction of h2o <dig>  organic hydroperoxides and lipid peroxides using gsh and/or other reducing equivalents  <cit> . the up-regulation of gsts  and gpx-like protein gpx54hv  in xihan no.  <dig> may protect cell membrane from oxidative damage and maintain cellular redox homeostasis  <cit> . the up-regulated probable l-ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> can detoxify h2o <dig> to h2o and promote the fine-tuning of ascorbate-glutathione cycle  <cit> . mn-sod  is the principal scavenger for superoxide in mitochondria, thus its up-regulation in xihan no.  <dig> may provide the dismutation role of superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen in mitochondrial  <cit> . it appeared that the multi-components antioxidant systems may take part in ros scavenging and maintain a higher drought tolerance in xihan no.  <dig>  however, only one up-regulated ascorbate peroxidase  and one down-regulated gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase  catalyzing production of the cellular antioxidant gsh  <cit>  were identified in longchun  <dig>  the down-regulation of γ-gcs might inhibit gsh synthesis and lead to a higher oxidative state in longchun  <dig> under drought stress.

defense-related proteins
twelve defense-related proteins were identified in xihan no.  <dig>  including glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase , cyclophilin-like protein , nad-binding rossmann-fold-containing protein , cbs domain containing protein , alpha- <dig> -glucan-protein synthase , germin-like protein  <dig> , xylanase inhibitor taxi-iv , stress responsive protein  and usp family protein . except for alpha- <dig> -glucan-protein synthase and germin-like protein  <dig>  all the other proteins were up-regulated at least one time stage under drought stress. glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase  can degrade the fungal cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> , and its up-regulation in xihan no.  <dig> may protect against fungal pathogen infection under drought stress. cyclophilin-like protein  belongs to a large family of enzyme with peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which might participate in stress response and pathogen immunity in xihan no.  <dig> as suggested by chen et al.  <cit>  and gan et al.  <cit> . xylanase inhibitor taxi-iv  can suppress microbial xylanases and participate in defense against fungal and bacteria pathogens  <cit> . cbs domain containing protein  is connected by  <dig> or  <dig> cystathionine β-synthase  domains  <cit> . over-expression of this protein can improve salinity, oxidative and heavy metal tolerance in transgenic tobacco  <cit> , speculating its important role in stress response. nad-binding rossmann-fold-containing protein  can produce coenzyme nad+ that is an important proton transfer and energy receptor in respiration, and its up-regulation in xihan no.  <dig> may accelerate anaerobic respiration and reduce toxic substances accumulation under drought stress. in addition, the up-regulation of stress responsive protein  and usp family protein  also showed the potential to improve resistance against drought in xihan no.  <dig>  however, only a few defense-related proteins were identified in longchun  <dig>  such as putative plastid-lipid-associated protein  <dig>  involved in drought-related jasmonate biosynthesis  <cit> , thaumatin-like protein tlp <dig>  and class ii chitinase-like protein  associated with pathogen resistance  <cit> . all the results indicated that more defense mechanisms were induced in the drought-tolerant cultivar than in the sensitive cultivar under drought stress, which can contribute to stronger drought resistance.

energy-related proteins
f-atpase is a key enzyme of energy metabolism that uses the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation or photosynthesis to drive atp synthesis  <cit> . the up-regulation of f1-atpase  and atp synthase precursor  in xihan no.  <dig> might enhance atp synthesis and provide more energy for drought resistance. the similar behaviours of these proteins were also described in wheat, rice, boea hydrometrica and arabidopsis thaliana under various abiotic stresses . the up-regulated adenylate kinase a  in xihan no.  <dig> could contribute to regulate multiple cellular energy-dependent and nucleotide signaling processes under drought stress through catalyzing phosphotransfer as suggested by dzeja and terzic  <cit> . however, only one energy-related protein, f0-f <dig> atpase alpha subunit , were identified in longchun  <dig>  which was up-regulated during the early period of drought stress and then down-regulated. it suggested that comparing to a transient enhancement of atp synthesis during the early period of drought stress in sensitive cultivar, drought-tolerant cultivar can enhance energy metabolism for drought resistance through a continuous atp synthesis.

protein translation, processing and degradation-related proteins
many identified proteins in two wheat cultivars were attributed to protein metabolism, which were divided into three functional groups. the first group was functioned in protein biosynthesis. translation elongation factor is a core translational protein that catalyzes the initiation and elongation of newly growing peptide chains  <cit> . several gtp-driven elongation factors, chloroplast translational elongation factor tu  in xihan no.  <dig> and elongation factor g  and elongation factor tu  in longchun  <dig>  were down-regulated, reflecting that the gtp-dependent ribosomal translocation elongation of protein biosynthesis might be inhibited by drought stress  <cit> . the similar behaviours of these proteins were also described in soybean genotypes with different salt tolerance  <cit> . ribosomal protein is one kind of highly conserved proteins that make up ribosomal subunits involved in the cellular process of translation  <cit> . the up-regulation of 30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> and 50s ribosomal protein l <dig>  in longchun  <dig> can promote mrna/ribosome interactions early in translation  <cit> . the second group participated in protein degradation. proteolysis is necessary for the removal of abnormal, modified and mistargeted proteins and for altering the balance of proteins  <cit> . proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig> , 20s proteasome beta  <dig> subunit , aspartic proteinase nepenthesin- <dig> precursor , triticain alpha  in xihan no.  <dig>  and proteasome subunit alpha type-7-a , proteasome subunit alpha type- <dig>  and atp-dependent clp protease proteolytic subunit  in longchun  <dig>  were up-regulated under drought stress. it was postulated that proteases and proteasomes play key roles in maintaining strict protein quality control and degrading specific sets of proteins in response to drought stress in both drought-tolerant and sensitive cultivars  <cit> . the third group was engaged in protein refolding and assembly. heat shock proteins  act as molecular chaperones that protect plants against various stresses by re-establishing normal protein conformation and cellular homeostasis . two hsp70s,  <dig> kda heat shock protein  and chloroplast envelope membrane  <dig> kda heat shock-related protein , were down-regulated in xihan no.  <dig>  it was proposed that the transport of newly synthesized peptides was decreased in xihan no.  <dig>  partially due to the decreased protein synthesis under stress conditions as suggested by jiang et al.  <cit>  and cheng et al.  <cit> . chaperone protein dnaj  <dig>  as an hsp <dig> chaperone was up-regulated in longchun  <dig> during the middle period of drought stress, which can help transfer substrate proteins to hsp70s and regulate their atpase activity  <cit> . the down-regulated chaperone protein clpc <dig>  in longchun  <dig> can reduce the degradation ability of denatured chloroplast proteins. peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, a superfamily of ubiquitous folding catalysts, catalyzes the interconversion of peptidyl-prolyl imide bonds in peptide and protein substrates  <cit> . the up-regulated peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase fkbp20- <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> and down-regulated peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase  in longchun  <dig> reflected its critical role in accelerating protein folding of drought-tolerant cultivar. overall, the expression patterns of these proteins in three groups indicated that protein biosynthesis might be inhibited by drought stress in both drought-tolerant and sensitive cultivars, whereas the higher degradation ability of denatured proteins as well as the enhanced protein folding may be appeared in tolerant cultivar for drought resistance.

transport, cellular structure and signaling-related proteins
some transport-related proteins were identified to be up-regulated in xihan no.  <dig> and longchun  <dig>  indicating that there exists active transport of ions and metabolites for drought adaptation in both drought-tolerant and sensitive wheat cultivars. voltage dependent anion channel  regulates metabolic and energetic flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . the up-regulation of vdac  and mitochondrial outer membrane porin  could enhance the exchange of ions and molecules between mitochondria and cytosol for maintaining intracellular homeostasis under drought stress. ylp  belonged to the component of vacuolar h+-atpase subunit e in xihan no.  <dig> and vacuolar proton-atpase subunit a  in longchun  <dig> were also up-regulated, which may maintain an electrochemical proton gradient across the tonoplast to drive transmembrane transport of ions and metabolites for drought adaptation as suggested by wang et al.  <cit> . the up-regulated rab protein  in longchun  <dig> may function as regulators in membrane-trafficking pathways  <cit> . in addition, there were two proteins associated with cellular structure and signaling functions identified in longchun  <dig>  actin can form microfilaments that are essential elements of cytoskeleton  <cit> . the up-regulated actin  in longchun  <dig> might be required to adjust cellular behavior in response to drought stress. calreticulin  as an abundant ca2+-binding protein maintains the intracellular ca2+ homeostasis and ca2+ signaling pathway  <cit> , which plays a positive role in stress response of plants such as cold, drought and disease . the down-regulated crt  in longchun  <dig> appeared that ca2+ signaling transduction was weakened and thus cannot start some key defense reaction in drought-sensitive cultivar.

miscellaneous and unknown proteins
in addition to the major protein classes, other important proteins were also identified. udp-glucuronate decarboxylase  <dig>  involved in cell wall biosynthesis of plants  <cit>  was up-regulated and then gradually down-regulated in xihan no.  <dig>  reflecting that the cell wall components of drought-tolerant cultivar were impacted by drought. the up-regulated ankyrin-repeat protein hbp <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> might be a positive response to drought signaling by mediating protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the rapidly down-regulated victorin binding protein  in xihan no.  <dig> seems to reduce the intracellular toxin  <cit> . s-like rnases have been reported to be induced by inorganic phosphate-starvation or in response to pathogen infection and mechanical wounding  <cit> . the up-regulated s-like rnases  in both two wheat cultivars might act as a positive regulator in drought response as suggested by zheng et al.  <cit> . two key enzymes in ubiquitination-proteasomal pathway, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme  <dig>  in xihan no.  <dig> and nedd8-conjugating enzyme ubc <dig>  in longchun  <dig>  were up-regulated, implicating that the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation plays an important role in drought tolerance of wheat as suggested by zhou et al.  <cit> . the up-regulated flavoprotein wrba-like isoform  <dig>  in longchun  <dig> could prevent interaction of the semiquinone with o <dig> and production of superoxide under drought stress  <cit> . otherwise, there were some unknown proteins identified, which are subject to further studies for clarifying their contributions in response to drought stress in wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
our integrated analysis of physiology and proteome data provides useful information about the drought-response mechanism of two wheat cultivars with different drought tolerance . quantitative image analysis of 2-de gels showed significant variations of  <dig> protein spots from xihan no.  <dig> and  <dig> protein spots from longchun  <dig>  out of these spots, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> differentially abundant proteins were identified by maldi-tof/tof ms in xihan no.  <dig> and longchun  <dig>  respectively. most of these identified proteins were involved in metabolism, photosynthesis, defence and protein translation/processing/degradation in two wheat cultivars. in addition, the proteins involved in redox homeostasis, energy, transcription, cellular structure, signalling and transport were also identified. hierarchical clustering results revealed that these proteins were involved in a dynamic network in response to drought stress. the representative models for summarizing the functional and regulatory networks activated by drought stress in xihan no.  <dig> and longchun  <dig> were illustrated in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. wheat leaf cells can perceive drought signalling through putative sensors and transmit them to regulate transcription, protein synthesis and processing, thereby affecting the levels of functional proteins involved in metabolism, photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, defence, energy and so on. these cellular processes work more cooperatively to re-establish homeostasis in drought-tolerant cultivar than sensitive cultivar. more glucose metabolism-related enzymes regulated in sensitive cultivar suggested more energy requirement in sensitive cultivar under drought stress. the up-regulation of proline biosynthesis-related enzyme can enhance the osmotic adjustment ability of cells in drought-tolerant cultivar. the down-regulation of rubisco is one of main non-stomatal factors for the decreased photosynthetic rate in both two wheat cultivars, whereas the relative stability of ps ii might be an effective method of drought-tolerant cultivar in response to drought stress. the up-regulation of atp synthesis-related enzymes can enhance energy metabolism in drought-tolerant cultivar for protective and repair reactions. the higher degradation ability of denatured proteins as well as the enhanced protein folding may be associated with stronger drought resistance in tolerant cultivar. more defense mechanisms induced in the tolerant cultivar than in the sensitive cultivar can also contribute to stronger drought resistance. future work should integrate transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the sophisticated molecular networks of response and acclimation to drought stress in wheat.fig.  <dig> the representative models for summarizing the functional and regulatory networks activated by drought stress in xihan no.  <dig>  the identified proteins are displayed on the corresponding metabolic pathways. the colour boxes are representative of expression profiles of individual protein during dehydration and rehydration. the up- and down-regulation of proteins are indicated in red and green, respectively. the colours intensity is increased with the expression differences increasing. the number given on the left side of each colour boxes indicates the protein identification number in accordance with additional file 6: table s4
