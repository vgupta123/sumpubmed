BACKGROUND
plants have developed complex signal transduction pathways to cope with fluctuating environmental changes throughout their life cycles. environmental stresses, such as high salinity, drought, cold and heat affect not only crop yield but also quality. ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger that is involved in the signaling of a variety of environmental and developmental stimuli. in response to these stimuli, cells generate transient changes in the intracellular ca2+ concentration and these changes are sensed and decoded by ca2+ sensors including calmodulins , calmodulin-like proteins , calcineurin b-like proteins  and calcium-dependent protein kinases   <cit> . the cpks constitute one of the largest calcium sensing subfamilies of serine/threonine protein kinases that have been identified throughout the plant kingdom from algae to angiosperms and also in some protozoans  <cit> .

cpks contain four characteristic functional domains including an n-terminal domain, a protein kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain and a calmodulin-like domain  <cit> . the n-terminal domain often contains myristoylation or palmitoylation sites for membrane association  <cit>  and is highly variable, which may determine its substrate specificity  <cit> . the c-terminal calmodulin-like domain  contains ef-hands for binding to ca2+ <cit> . previous studies identified a total of  <dig> cpk genes in the model plant arabidopsis  <cit> . an investigation of the sequenced rice genome revealed  <dig> cpk genes in rice  <cit> . a similar attempt in bread wheat identified  <dig> cpk genes  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of cpks from both arabidopsis and rice demonstrated that they can be clustered into four distinct subgroups  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, rice, and a few other plant species, functional analyses of cpks using gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants have revealed the biological function of cpks in an array of physiological processes, including accumulation of storage starch in immature seeds of rice  <cit> , pollen tube elongation  <cit> , root development  <cit> , cell division, differentiation and programmed cell death  <cit>  and more importantly, in abiotic and biotic stress and hormone signaling  <cit> . for instance, members of cpk families in arabidopsis and rice have been reported to be involved in drought  <cit> , salt  <cit> , cold  <cit> , abscisic acid   <cit> , reactive oxygen species   <cit>  signaling pathways and immune responses against pathogens  <cit> . besides, in aba signaling, three arabidopsis cpk proteins, cpk <dig>  cpk <dig> and cpk <dig>  have been found to phosphorylate aba-responsive bzip-type transcription factors   <cit> , though the exact phosphorylation sites have not been determined. in addition, two tobacco  cpdk genes, ntcdpk <dig> and ntcdpk <dig> were identified to play an essential role in defense response and, ntcdpk <dig> functions together with stress-induced mapks  to control response specificity to abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . taken together, the above reports clearly demonstrate that plant cpk genes are essential to confer increased resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. however, the specific functions of many cpks and their target proteins in plants are still not clear.

despite extensive studies of cpks in many other species  <cit> , little is known about this gene family in canola . until now, only one cpk  from b. napus has been deposited in genbank  and the role of cpk in canola growth and development as well as in response to abiotic and biotic stresses have not been reported at all. canola, with low erucic acid and glucosinolates, is one of the most important oil crops in china and worldwide. losses from adverse environmental conditions greatly influence canola production and quality. to understand the molecular mechanisms of canola responses to abiotic stresses is a prerequisite for many approaches towards improving stress tolerance to meet increasing demands for edible oil. this is a promising approach to improve stress tolerance of plants by modulating the expression of key genes in plant breeding. canola is an allotetraploid, and its complete genome sequence is not publicly available yet.

in view of the importance of cpk genes in biotic and abiotic stress responses, we initiated a project to isolate cpks from canola. in the present study, we systematically identified and cloned the cdna sequences of  <dig> cpk genes from canola by mining the expressed sequence tag database. evolutionary history reconstruction via comparison with cpk genes from other plant species was performed. furthermore, we analyzed the subcellular localization of canola cpks, and their expression profiles under abiotic stress, which suggested that they participated in stress-related signal transduction pathways. furthermore, interaction of canola cpk with clade a bzips and pp2cs were examined through yeast two-hybrid assays and bifc. the current work represents the first comprehensive study of cpk genes in canola and provides a solid foundation for further functional investigation of this important gene family in canola.

RESULTS
identification and cdna cloning of calcium-dependent protein kinase genes in canola
ca2+-dependent protein kinases  are both ca2+ sensors and ser/thr kinases that are found only in plants and some protozoans. because sequences or functions of cpk genes in oilseed rape  have not been reported, we were motivated to characterize this important gene family in canola. as the first step to understand the roles of cpk genes in canola growth and development, as well as in response to abiotic and biotic stress conditions, we initiated a project to identify and clone the cdna sequences of cpk genes from canola. considering the high similarity between arabidopsis and canola genomes and the fact that sequencing of canola genome has not been finished, we used the cdna sequences of  <dig> arabidopsis cpk genes as the queries in blast searches of the expressed sequence tag  database of b. napus in ncbi  with an e-value cut-off of lower than 10- <dig>  the obtained ests were further examined to remove vector sequences through vecscreen  and were assembled to obtain contigs and singlets, which were then reciprocally blast searched against the arabidopsis database  to identify putative orthologs in the model plant arabidopsis. as a result, we identified  <dig> ests representing  <dig> canola cpks . these ests were clustered into  <dig> singlets and  <dig> contigs . for comparison and clarity, the nomenclature of respective canola cpk genes was annotated according to the arabidopsis orthologs with bna abbreviating b. napus . we noted that among the  <dig> bnacpks annotated, bnacpk <dig> had the largest number  of ests, followed by bnacpk <dig> with a total of  <dig> ests and, bnacpk <dig> with  <dig> ests while bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> had only one est each .

to facilitate the subsequent phylogenetic, gfp fusion, yeast two-hybrid and other analyses, we designed primers based on the identified ests for each of the bnacpk genes to allow us to amplify the full-length cdna sequences, employing both regular rt-pcr and race technologies. as a result, we succeeded in cloning the cdna sequences of  <dig> of the  <dig> bnacpk genes . for seven bnacpk genes, two slightly different alleles were cloned, which were bnack <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  for comparison, we also identified putative orthologs of these bnacpk genes in both arabidopsis and rice .

sequence analysis of canola bnacpk genes
after examining the sequences of the  <dig> cloned bnacpk genes, we found that the length of their coding regions  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the full-length canola cdpk proteins conceptually translated from the full-length cdna we cloned were  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long. the molecular weight of the predicted bnacpk proteins range from  <dig> to  <dig>  kda, with an isoelectric point  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . we also found that the cdna sequence identity of different bnacpks ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % , whereas the amino acid sequence identity of different bnacpks ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

it was noted that the deduced amino acid sequences of the  <dig> bnacpk genes showed high conservation both in size and structure, with a kinase domain near the n-terminus and four ca2+-binding ef-hand motifs at the c-terminus . we found that there is an insert of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids in the kinase domain of bnacpk <dig> and - <dig>  respectively . as ca2+ sensors, cpk proteins are known to be able to bind ca2+ ions through the ef-hand motifs. indeed, all the  <dig> canola cpk proteins with full-length sequences had a calmodulin-like structure with four ef-hand motifs at their c-terminus . we did not observe any of the  <dig> bnacdpks with fewer than four ef-hands as reported in arabidopsis, rice and maize  <cit> .

as a special class of post-translational modifications , many proteins including cpks could be covalently modified by a variety of lipids, such as myristate  and palmitate   <cit> . in rice, it has been shown that oscpk <dig> is both myristoylated and palmitoylated and targeted to the membrane fraction. both modifications of oscpk <dig> are required, myristoylation being essential for membrane localization and palmitoylation for its full association  <cit> . another study of tobacco ntcdpk <dig> and ntcdpk <dig> also demonstrated that myristoylation and palmitoylationâ€“mediated membrane localization is necessary for proper function of these two kinases in regulating stress response  <cit> . although most of lipid modifications are irreversible, protein s-palmitoylation, also called as thioacylation or s-acylation, could reversibly attach 16-carbon saturated fatty acids to specific cysteine residues in protein substrates through thioester linkages  <cit> . palmitoylation will enhance the surface hydrophobicity and membrane affinity of protein substrates, and play important roles in modulating proteinsâ€™ trafficking, stability, and sorting, etc  <cit> . our bioinformatic analysis revealed that ten of the  <dig> bnacpk proteins bear potential n-myristoylation motifs  for membrane association and they are bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . we also found that n-terminal sequences of  <dig> of the  <dig> bnacpk proteins, except bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  harbored palmitoylation sites , which indicated that myristoylation and palmitoylation modifications of bnacpk might be functional in membrane targeting and stability of bnacpk proteins.

phylogenetic analysis of cdpk gene family
to better understand the evolutionary history of the cdpk/cpk gene family, we used a hmm-based search to identify and retrieve cpk genes from a variety of species, especially those with sequenced genomes. we mined the genomes of those plant species that represent the most important milestones characterizing the evolution of land plants . as a result, we identified  <dig> distinct cpks from b. distachyon,  <dig> from s. bicolor,  <dig> from s. moellendorffii,  <dig> from the moss p. patens,  <dig> from the model alga c. reinhardtii, three from o. tauri and four from o. lucimarinus . similarly, we mined the recently sequenced chinese cabbage  genome, a progenitor of b. napus and identified a total of  <dig> bracpk genes whose translated protein sequences harbored typical domains and motifs of cpk proteins including the n-terminal kinase domain and c-terminal ef-hand motif. further, an orthologous comparison of these  <dig> bracpk genes to the  <dig> atcpk genes indicated that only  <dig> pairs of orthologs exist, with the remaining being alleles of these  <dig> genes , suggesting a genome duplication event may have caused the expansion of some genes in b. rapa. we then compared the  <dig> bracpk genes to the  <dig> bnacpk genes we cloned and, confirmed that for all the  <dig> bnacpks, orthologs could be identified . the identification of multiple members of cpk gene families in all the analyzed plant species suggested that cpk proteins may play a role in response to developmental and environmental stimuli.

it has been observed that the size of the canola cpk gene family is comparable to that of either arabidopsis or rice. on the other hand, only six, four and  <dig> cpk genes were identified from the three lower organisms o. tauri, o. lucimarinus and c. reinhardtii, respectively . furthermore, we only identified  <dig> cpks genes from the lycophyte s. moellendorffii. this indicates an expansion of cpk gene family after the divergence of flowering plants from the remainder of the tracheophyte lineage. furthermore, comparing the numbers of cpk genes between lower and higher organisms indicates an obvious expansion of this gene family during the long history of evolution, which is supported by a very recent study  <cit> .

the amino acid sequences of bnacpks together with cpks from other species were aligned and a consensus maximum parsimony dendrogram was produced . as shown by the treeâ€™s topology, the cpk proteins from various species could be divided into four distinct groups , each supported by highly significant bootstrap values, as reported previously with rice and wheat cpk proteins  <cit> . the  <dig> canola cpks were distributed in each of the four groups, with bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> belonging to group i, bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> belonging to group ii, bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> belonging to group iii, and bnacpk <dig> and - <dig> group iv . we also reconstructed the phylogenetic tree of cpk proteins from arabidopsis, canola, b. rapa and rice, and also found that the cpks could be clustered into four distinct groups . it was also noted that the  <dig> bnacpk members were always closely clustered in the same group as atcpk and bracpk orthologs, as expected for these two members of the family brassicaceae. in addition, phylogenetic analysis based on predicted amino acid sequences could distinguish  <dig> closely related pairs of canola cpks: bnacpk1/ <dig> , bnacpk4/ <dig> , bnacpk5/ <dig> , bnacpk7/ <dig> , bnacpk10/ <dig> , bnacpk15/ <dig> , bnacpk17/ <dig>  and bnacpk18/ <dig>  . past research has demonstrated that closely related pairs of cpks in arabidopsis may play similar roles or are co-localized in certain subcellular compartments. for instance, in arabidopsis, cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> regulate aba signaling  <cit> , cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> increase pollen tube tip growth  <cit> , and cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> are both localized in the plasma membrane  <cit> . knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships of canola cpks should facilitate dissection of their function.

to gain insights into the evolutionary history of the cpk family in plants, we used the deduced amino acid sequences of  <dig> canola cpk sequences as well as those identified from a variety of representative plant species to infer the phylogenetic relationships . the resulting dendrogram showed most cpks, especially those from land plants could essentially be classified into four distinct groups , based on to their sequence similarity, which was further supported by the high bootstrap values. however, some of the cpks mainly from green algae, plus a few from the pteridophyte s. moellendorffii, the bryophyte p. patens, s. bicolor and b. distachyon constitute a distinct clade, which is similar to a recent analysis  <cit> .

from our phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignment and domain analysis of bnacpks in canola, we concluded some of the cpk family members may be conserved among monocots while others were lost after the divergence of the monocots and dicots. the phylogenetic analysis together with the domain motif analysis presented here will facilitate the functional annotation and study of canola cpks.

subcellular localization of selected bnacpk proteins
to examine the subcellular localizations of canola cpks, we used translational fusions with green fluorescence protein . in total, six canola cpks  were tested regarding their subcellular localization in n. benthamiana leaf cells. of these, constructs with five of the selected bnacpk-gfp genes produced detectable fluorescence . fusion with bnacpk <dig> did not. among the cpks tested, bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were predicted to have a myristoylation motif, while bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> had palmitoylation sites . we also expressed each of the bnacpk-gfp fusion genes together with a putative plasma membrane marker atcbl1n  <cit>  fused to the mcherry reporter gene. the gfp fusion proteins of bnacpk <dig> and - <dig> were found to be associated with plasma membranes and nuclei . however, it seemed that proteins lacking a myristoylation and/or palmitoylation motif were also localized to the plasma membrane since three canola cpks, bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> displayed fluorescence at the plasma membrane and nuclei . this may indicate the existence of additional motifs that provide these cpks with their membrane association ability, which probably was not detected by the computer program. similar observations were made with wheat cpk <dig> and - <dig> proteins, which lacked myristoylation motifs but were associated with membranes  <cit> . we also found that all five bnacpks  were localized in the nucleus as well .

as a control, we tested the subcellular localization of gfp or mcherry protein alone in the leaf cells of n. benthamiana and observed that the signal was spread throughout the cytoplasm of the leaf epidermal cells as well as in the nuclei .

expression profiles of cdpk genes in response to abiotic stress and hormone treatments
one of the most important functions of cpk proteins is to sense changes in cytosolic calcium concentration during biotic and abiotic challenges  <cit> . to understand the responses of cpk genes to environmental stresses and hormone stimuli in canola, we used quantitative rt-pcr  to analyze the transcript changes of canola cpk genes. 18-day-old canola seedling tissues of three biological replicates were collected after being exposed to salt, cold, heat, drought, paraquat , aba, and low potassium  for  <dig> and  <dig> h. we chose these abiotic stresses and hormone application for two reasons, since salt, cold, heat and drought are the most devastating factors influencing crop yielding and quality and, aba is a stress hormone playing very important roles in plant growth, development and responses to abiotic stresses including salinity, drought and to a less extent cold. ros acts as signaling molecules in stress adaptation, hormone signaling, and programmed cell death   <cit> . past reports have demonstrated that a few cpk genes in arabidopsis, rice and potato are involved in either drought  <cit> , salinity  <cit> , cold  <cit> , aba  <cit>  or ros  <cit>  signaling. potassium  is the most important and abundant cation in living plant cells. however, due to the limited availability of k+ in soils, many crops often suffer from k+-deficiency stress . although the cbl-cipk system has been shown to play an important role in lk responses through phosphorylating k+ channel-akt <dig>  <cit> , the role of cpk genes in lk responses is unknown. emerging evidence also suggests that ros participate in lk responses  <cit> . therefore, we measured changes in transcript abundance of  <dig> bnacpk genes in response to the seven stress treatments described above . the expression profiles of the remaining four genes were not examined because the specificity of the designed primers was insufficient.

statistical analysis of three biological replicates revealed that transcript abundance of  <dig> out of  <dig> canola cpk genes, except bnacpk <dig>  showed significant changes in response to at least one stress treatment . often, one cpk was able to respond to several treatments and, on the other hand, one treatment affected multiple cpk genes. for example, eight genes  responded to saline stress and they were all down regulated . cold stress significantly induced bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> but repressed bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  in contrast, the transcript abundance of bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> was up-regulated by heat stress, while bnacpk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated. mv-induced oxidative stress increased the transcript accumulation of bnacpk <dig>  but decreased that of bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  when  <dig> Î¼m aba was applied to soil-grown canola seedlings, it induced the expression of bnacpk  <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> while repressed bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  in response to drought treatment, bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were induced, whereas bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> repressed. finally, we assayed the transcript levels of  <dig> bnacpk genes in hydroponically-grown canola roots when subjected to low k+ treatment, and found that bnacpk <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were up-regulated by lk compared to mock treatment, while bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were down-regulated at early or late time-points. taken together, our data not only demonstrated that bnacpk genes are involved in salt, cold, heat, mv, aba, drought stresses, as reported with cpks in arabidopsis, rice and a few other species, but also showed that bnacpks likely respond to ca2+ fluctuation caused by lk stress. from another point of view, among these  <dig> bnacpk genes analyzed, bnacpk <dig> also responded to cold, mv, aba, drought and lk treatments and, bnacpk <dig> responded to cold, heat and mv treatments. on the other hand, bnacpk <dig> was down-regulated by salt, heat, mv, aba and lk treatments . therefore, canola cpks seemed to be mediate cross-talk among different signaling pathways.

taken together, analysis of transcript expression patterns of  <dig> bnacpk genes in canola seedlings after various stress treatments suggested that different cpk genes may participate in the signaling process to a single stress and a single cpk likely plays a role in multiple stress responses.

cloning and sequence analysis of clade a bzip and pp2c genes in canola
we sought to identify the substrates of bnacpk proteins, with the knowledge that multiple bnacpk genes responded to different abiotic stress treatments as assayed by qrt-pcr and that aba is a phytohormone that participates in many abiotic stress signaling pathways  <cit> . since aba responsive cis-element  <cit>  binding factor/protein  transcription factors  in the clade a basic leucine zipper  family regulate abre-dependent gene expression  <cit>  and, previous studies demonstrated that arabidopsis cpk <dig> and cpk <dig> exert their functions in aba signaling through phosphorylating abf transcription factors abf <dig> and abf4/areb <dig>  while cpk <dig> phosphorylates abf <dig> and interacts with abf <dig>  abf2/areb <dig> and abf <dig> as well  <cit> . in addition, atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig> are known to interact with abf <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assays  <cit> . however, these interactions have not previously been demonstrated in vivo.

to test whether bnacpks could similarly act upstream of clade a bzip tfs, we first used cdna sequences of arabidopsis abf <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  areb <dig> and abi <dig> genes to obtain canola ests that showed significant homology to five of these six genes. these were bnaabf <dig>  bnaabf <dig>  bnaabf <dig>  bnaareb <dig>  bnaabi <dig> . we did not identify any ests encoding bnaabf <dig>  we further cloned the full-length cdna sequences of all five canola tfs . sequence and domain analysis as well as phylogenetic comparison of the translated protein sequences revealed that these five bzip proteins showed very high identity/similarity to their orthologs in arabidopsis and also harbored characteristic domains and motifs .

a
athe gene synteny was detected by inparanoid .

n/a. cdna cloning was not successful.

in contrast to kinases, protein phosphatases act to remove the phosphorous group from the phosphorylated target therefore negatively regulating signaling process. over half of all arabidopsis protein phosphatases belong to the monomeric pp2c subfamily, which has  <dig> members, belonging to ten or more subgroups or clades  <cit> . during the long history of evolution from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes, pp2cs have expanded and diversified, with an increase in the number of distinct clades and in the total number of genes encoding for pp2cs  <cit> . for instance, clade a pp2cs of plants are not found in prokaryotes or in non-plant eukaryotes, such as yeast. in arabidopsis, clade a pp2c are highly correlated with response to aba and drought stress and, molecular studies have identified interactions with proteins including transcription factors of the homeodomain-leucine zipper  class, a chromatin remodeling factor, and members of the snrk  and mapk  families, or pyr/pyl/rcar class of aba receptors  <cit> . more recently, direct interactions between arabidopsis cpk <dig> and members of clade a pp2cs were reported  <cit> , suggesting that cpk-pp2c interaction may be a common mechanism in plant signaling under developmental stimuli and/or biotic stresses. however, a detailed and systematical examination of interactions between cpks and clade a pp2c or cpks and abf/areb/abi <dig> clade is lacking. besides, the sequences and function of these pp2c and bzip tfs in canola has not been reported.

to this end, we also identified, cloned and sequenced the cdna sequences of clade a pp2cs in canola, using a technique similar to bnacpk cloning as described previously. we first identified the ests for these pp2c genes  and used rt-pcr/race to amplify the cdna sequences. as a result, eight clade a pp2c genes were cloned, which were bnaabi <dig>  abi <dig>  hab <dig>  hab <dig>  ahg <dig>  ahg <dig>  hai <dig> and hai <dig> according to the nomenclature of their orthologs in arabidopsis . sequence, domain analysis and phylogenetic analyses of the translated protein sequences revealed that these eight pp2c proteins showed very high identity/similarity to their orthologs in arabidopsis and also harbored typical domains and motifs .

identification of bnacpk interacting proteins
to test the interactions between canola cpks and clade a bzips or pp2cs, we subcloned the coding regions of canola cpks and bzips or pp2cs into the gal4-bd  and gal4-ad  vectors, respectively. after transformation into the yeast strain ah <dig>  interactions were detected by growth on several types of media: non-selective  medium; selective medium lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan supplemented with  <dig> mm of 3-aminotriazole  ; or selective media lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, adenine hemisulfate . we observed that colony growth on the two types of selective media  was slightly different from each and thus only those yeast colonies that grew on the most stringent media sd-lwha were scored as having interacting protein partners. the authenticity and strength of the interactions were further examined by a titration assay and x-gal staining .

as shown in figureÂ  <dig>  we found that bnacpk <dig> interacted with bnaahg <dig> and bnahai3; bnacpk <dig> with bnahab <dig>  bnahab <dig>  bnaahg <dig> and bnahai2; bnacpk <dig> with bnahai <dig> only; bnacpk <dig> with bnahab <dig> only; bnacpk <dig> with bnaahg <dig>  bnahai <dig> and bnahai3; bnacpk <dig> with bnahab <dig> only, among the eight clade a pp2c proteins tested. in contrast, we did not observe any yeast colony growth with the empty vector control, i.e. bnacpks and pgadt <dig> combinations. the other bnacpks did not show any interaction with any of the eight bnapp2cs , indicating specificity of interaction between bnacpks and bnapp2cs. a recent study identified that arabidopsis cpk <dig> interacts with ahg <dig> and ahg <dig> in y2h  <cit> ; however, canola cpk <dig> did not show interaction with bnaahg <dig> and bnaahg <dig>  suggesting that bnacpk <dig> function may differ from its ortholog in arabidopsis, which needs to be studied further.

surprisingly, we failed to detect any interaction between any of the  <dig> bnacpks with any of the five clade a bzip tfs  through streaking or titration assay on both non-selective sd-lw and selective sd-lwha media within  <dig> d at 30Â°c . although yeast colonies harboring all bnacpk-bzip combinations grew well on control sd-lw medium plates within 2- <dig> days, no growth was detected on selective sd-lwha media within  <dig> d . interestingly, purported substrates for atcpk <dig> and atcpk <dig>  abf <dig> and abf <dig>  <cit> , were not identified as putative substrates in y2h screens  <cit> . a recent report demonstrated that use of the constitutively active versions of the cpk baits improved the recovery of positive interacting proteins relative to the wild-type kinases  <cit> . although this may raise a question on the correlation between y2h and kinase-substrate, we hypothesized that expression levels of plant tfs in the heterogeneous yeast may not be high enough to assure interactions, a prerequisite of every y2h system. however, this would be an issue worth carefully examining in detail.

bimolecular fluorescence complementation  analysis of interactions
to assay the interactions between canola cpks and clade a bzip tfs or pp2cs in planta, we employed yfp -based bifc. for this purpose, we fused the coding regions of bnacpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and bnaabf <dig>  abf <dig>  abf <dig>  areb <dig>  abi5a, hab <dig>  hab <dig> to the 5â€² and 3â€² of yfp half gene, respectively. after agrobacteria-mediated infiltration into n. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells, we examined the presence of yellow fluorescence signals  <dig> d later in at least three independent leaf discs.

the results showed that in leaf cells co-expressing bnacpk <dig> and bnahab <dig> or hab <dig>  evident yfp signal appeared in leaf cells , while in the control test, in which the pp2c partner was missing, no yellow signal was observed . yfp signals also appeared when bnacpk <dig> and bnahab <dig> were co-infiltrated , but no signal of reconstructed yfp appeared in the control cells . these data suggest our above results of screening of bnacpk-pp2c interactions are reliable.

we then used bifc to examine the interactions between bnacpks and bnaabf/areb/abi <dig> tfs in planta. the results showed that yfp signal appeared in infiltrated n. benthamiana cells when bnacpk <dig> and bnaabf <dig>  - <dig>  abi <dig> or areb <dig> were co-infiltrated . however, co-expression of bnacpk <dig> and bnaabf <dig> proteins did not yield any yfp signal, indicating specificity of interaction between bnacpk <dig> and tfs. in arabidopsis, abi <dig> is a core player in aba signaling and acts downstream of abi <dig>  and abi <dig> is regulated by both ubiquitin-mediated degradation and sumoylation  <cit> . our identification of areb <dig> and abi <dig> as novel interaction partners of cpk <dig> is novel and would be a good starting point for further study of their regulation in aba and drought signaling. since atcpk <dig> was found to interact with abf <dig> in y2h assay  <cit> , we also wanted to know whether this interaction was conserved and applicable to canola counterparts. however, the bifc assay showed that bnacpk <dig> and bnaabf <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  areb <dig> or abi <dig> did not interact at all, as no yellow signal was observed , suggesting that atcpk <dig> and bnacpk <dig> may play different roles at least in aba signaling. taken together, the results from bifc assay confirmed part of the interacting protein partners between bnacpks and bnapp2cs on one hand; on the other hand, bifc also discovered some novel interacting partners, which were not identified in y2h. we are currently investigating the cpk4-areb <dig> and cpk4-abi <dig> signaling pathway in both canola and arabidopsis using a reverse genetic strategy. we think testing the interactions between more bnacpks and abf/areb/abi <dig> tfs in n. benthamiana should help us to better understand the signaling pathways and possible mechanisms of interactions. considering the limitation of y2h in detection interactions between bnacpks and tfs, we are utilizing bifc to test the interactions between cpk <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> etc and abf/areb/abi <dig> tfs in planta one-by-one, so as to decipher the signaling pathways involved.

CONCLUSIONS
the calcium ion plays a central role as second messenger in eukaryotic signal transduction. cpks are chimeras containing a ca2+-sensor domain and a protein kinase effector domain within the same molecule. although functions of a few members of arabidopsis or rice cpks have been studied, many remain uncharacterized to date  <cit> . in addition, the inner mechanisms and the direct targets of most cpks are still not very clear. so far, no systematic analysis of the cpk family genes has been reported in the important oil crop canola.

in the present study, we carried out a detailed survey of the cpk gene family in canola and analyzed them on the bases of phylogenetic relationship, conserved protein motif, gene duplication, interaction partners and expression profiles to abiotic stress and the stress hormone aba treatments. a total of  <dig> cpk genes were identified from canola, with cdna sequences of  <dig> cpk genes cloned. we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> canola cpks assayed exhibited differential responses to multiple stress treatments, suggesting that they were major convergence points for cross talk between different signal transduction pathways. on the other hand, multiple cpks seemed to be necessary to coordinate responses to each specific stress stimulus. for instance, transcription of eight, seven, seven, seven canola cpk genes appeared to be affected by salt, cold, heat and drought treatments, respectively, indicating the involvement of multiple cpk signaling pathways in response to abiotic stress. in addition, we analyzed the protein partners of bnacpks using y2h and identified novel interacting proteins, including pp2cs. we also confirmed part of the interactions between canola cpks and pp2cs through bifc and, tested and identified novel aba-relevant tfs  as cpk <dig> substrates. therefore, our genomic, bioinformatic and experimental analyses of the cpk family genes and proteins provide a solid foundation for the further functional characterization of the cpk network involved in decoding calcium signals under different stress conditions. the elucidation of the precise roles of bnacpk genes, however, requires the use of other experimental approaches including overexpression and/or rnai silencing. taken together, by further understanding the functions and underlying mechanisms of the cpk network in canola through virus-induced gene silencing  and overexpression, as underway in our lab, we would be able to elucidate how the canola cpk network enables integration of multiple signals of the plantâ€™s environment and coordinates downstream responses to stresses such as toxic ion exposure, extreme temperatures and nutrient deprivation.
