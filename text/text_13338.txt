BACKGROUND
microalgae include many evolutionarily diverse lineages of unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes that range in size from a few to several hundred micrometers. they contribute significantly to the primary production and the biogeochemical cycle of our biosphere  <cit> . they have also found increasing applications for production of lipids, sugars, bioactive compounds and in particular, biofuels  <cit> .

cellular functions of present-day microalgae are underpinned by plastid , mitochondrial  and nuclear  genomes. pt and mt play important roles in the evolution of microalgae and higher plants. the origin of pt has been traced to an endosymbiosis event between eukaryotic cell and cyanobacteria, which occurred around  <dig>  ga ago  <cit> . the engulfed photosynthetic unicellular cyanobacteria adapted to the environment inside the host cells and eventually became the present day eukaryotic pt  <cit> . the pt genome, in multiple copies, is inherited in a non-mendelian fashion. therefore, the genetic information from pt genome can provide an independent view of the phylogeny of its host organisms. mt, according to the serial endosymbiosis theory, is the direct descendant of a bacterial endosymbiont  that became established in the early evolution of a nucleus-containing  host cell  <cit> . analysis of microalgal organelle genomes has revealed their endosymbiotic origins  <cit> , frequent gene transfers from organelles to nucleus  <cit>  and the phylogeny among genera  <cit> . however, evolutionary dynamics of organelle genomes that drive microalgal speciation  remains poorly understood.

due to their asexual reproduction, slow evolution, few recombination, and relatively simple gene structure and dominance of single-copy genes, organelle genes have often been employed as phylogenetic markers  <cit> , which are essential tools in algal research and biotechnology. several molecular markers are frequently used for phylotyping algae, including the second internal transcribed spacer  of nuclear ribosomal dna , mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i , and plastid ribulose-l-5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase . however, limitations of the strategy are apparent:  different markers frequently gave different phylogenetic scenario ;  most markers could not distinguish strains within a given species ;  currently available markers could not be applied to microalgae of all kinds   <cit> . for instance, cox <dig> is useful mainly for identification of red and brown algae  <cit> , whereas tufa  and rbcl serve as the primary dna barcodes for green algae and diatoms respectively  <cit> . however the genomic basis of such practices remains largely unknown. exhaustive search and comparative assessment of phylogenetic markers have not been possible, largely due to the paucity of complete organelle genomes from phylogenetically closely related strains and species.

nannochloropsis  is a genus of unicellular photosynthetic microalgae, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> μm and widely distributed in marine, fresh and brackish waters  <cit> . it is an emerging model for photosynthetic production of oil  because of its ability to grow rapidly, synthesize large amounts of tag and polyunsaturated fatty acids and tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions  <cit> . traditional approaches for identifying species in nannochloropsis include morphology observation, pigment and fatty acid composition and 18s rrna sequence analysis  <cit> . however previous analysis based on 18s  and rbcl  resulted in conflicting phylogenies among microalgae lineages that include nannochloropsis <cit> . moreover, the intragenus relationship of nannochloropsis spp.  was inconsistent among 18s-based phylogenetic trees  <cit> . in this study, using nannochloropsis genus as a model, we assessed current intragenus phylotyping strategies by producing the complete pt and mt genomes of seven strains from six nannochloropsis species. this first comprehensive dataset of organelle genomes for a microalgal genus was employed to dissect the evolutionary dynamics of organelle genomes at the genus, species and strain levels. furthermore, the dataset enabled exhaustive exploration of novel phylogenetic markers suitable for inter-species and intra-species identification of microalgae. a new strategy for intragenus phylotyping of microalgae was therefore proposed.

RESULTS
global structural features of the organelle genomes in nannochloropsis
to capture a comprehensive picture of microalgal organelle evolution at the strain-, species- and genus-levels, two n. oceanica strains  and one strain from each of other five known species in nannochloropsis genus: n. salina , n. gaditana , n. oculata , n. limnetica  and n. granulata  were chosen for sequencing . the pt and mt genomes of imet <dig> were first assembled from whole-genome shotgun reads and then manually finished . draft sequences of the other organelle genomes were extracted from whole-genome contigs by blast using imet <dig> as a reference. long-range pcr was used to test the orientation of large repeats and bridge the remaining gaps. the four junctions between the inverted repeats and single-copy segments were confirmed by sequencing pcr products. the seven sets of organelle genomes were manually inspected and completely finished .

the circular pt genomes ranged in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, with an average gc content of  <dig> %. each pt genome was divided into four structural domains : a large single copy , a small single copy , and inverted repeats  which are present in pinpoint duplicate separated by the two single-copy regions. such a quadripartite structure was previously found in many other algal pt genomes including the primary endosymbiotic chlamydomonas reinhardtii and secondary endosymbiotic diatoms phaeodactylum tricornutum and thalassiosira pseudonana <cit> .

each pt genome encodes  <dig> unique genes including  <dig> trna, three rrna and  <dig> proteins. in addition, eight genes , trna, rrn <dig> and rrn5) were duplicated in the ir of ccmp <dig>  ccmp <dig>  ccmp <dig>  ccmp <dig> and imet <dig>  while only five genes , trna, rrn <dig> and rrn5) were duplicated in the ir of ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  the overall genome structure and gene content of nannochloropsis pt are similar to those of t. pseudonana, p. tricornutum and ectocarpus siliculosus <cit> .

the circular mt genomes were  <dig>  ~  <dig>  bp in length , with an average gc content of 31%. the coding potential  was  <dig> %- <dig> %. each consists of  <dig> genes and  <dig> - <dig>  bp non-coding sequences. the coding regions of the seven mt genomes were similar in size to those of t. pseudonana and p. tricornutum <cit> , yet the coding potential of nannochloropsis mt genomes was higher, suggesting a relatively compact genome structure. although most regions of the seven mt genomes were conserved, a pair of  <dig> kb-long, cox1-harboring repeats were found only in ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  two segments of genes  were conserved in previously reported stramenopiles including diatoms and brown algae. however in nannochloropsis, the bacterial s <dig> operon block  was interrupted by rpl <dig> which inserted between rps <dig> and rps <dig> 

neither group i nor group ii type introns were present in any of the nannochloropsis organelle genes. although the pt and mt genomes of ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig> possessed increased numbers of small dispersed repetitive sequences compared to other nannochloropsis pt and mt genomes, overall there were fewer repeats in the nannochloropsis pt and mt genomes compared to those of diatoms. moreover, the seven sets of pt and mt genomes were highly conserved in gene content and gene size . in addition, the aligned regions  showed high similarities , with protein-coding regions generally more conserved than noncoding regions. therefore, compactness in pt and mt genome organization is a shared feature among the seven nannochloropsis strains.

protein complements of the organelle genomes
organelle genomes were thought to have undergone size- and functional reduction  <cit> , and frequent genetic exchange via endosymbiotic gene transfer  and homologous recombination  <cit> . the present-day microalgal pt genomes mainly encode the components of photosystems, carbon assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport and gene translation machinery  <cit> , while the mt genomes encode genes mostly involved in respiratory electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, atp synthesis and ribosome biosynthesis  <cit> . in nannochloropsis, brown algae and diatoms, nearly all the photosystem i and photosystem ii genes encoded by the pt genomes were retained in a high degree of consistency . however, a photosystem i gene  was lost in nannochloropsis pt genome. a photosystem ii gene  was also absent in the pt genomes of nannochloropsis as in other red algae, but was present in the green algae lineage  <cit> . in addition, all of the cytochrome components found in other stramenopiles and the red lineage of algae  have been retained in nannochloropsis pt genomes  <cit> .

all of the atp synthase genes  were found in pt genomes of stramenopiles  <cit> , except the seven nannochloropsis strains in which atpd was missing. the chlorophyll biosynthesis genes chlb, chll and chln were believed to be transferred to nucleus via egt in thalassiosira, odontella and heterosigma <cit> , however four chlorophyll biosynthesis genes  are still present in the pt genomes of nannochloropsis, ectocarpus, fucus, vaucheria and aureoumbra   <cit> . rbcr , which was usually encoded by pt genomes and autonomously governs transcription of rubisco operon in red algae  <cit> , is present in either pt or nuclear genomes of all known stramenopiles except nannochloropsis. the organization of pt ribosomal-protein genes in nannochloropsis was also similar to that of thalassiosira, odontella, heterosigma, ectocarpus and fucus, although rpl <dig> and rpl <dig> were lost in the nannochloropsis pt genomes. in addition, synechococcus phage s-sm <dig> gene segment was found in the nannochloropsis pt genomes, which is likely a signature of their cyanobacterial origin.

to identify the functional distinction of nannochloropsis mt genomes, the gene repertoires of  <dig> algal mt genomes were compared . the protein profiles of nannochloropsis mt genomes are largely similar to those of t. pseudonana and p. tricornutum. however, atp <dig> was retained only in nannochloropsis mt genome  and saprolegnia ferax)  <cit> . in p. tricornutum and t. pseudonana, atp <dig> were thought to be transferred to the nuclear genome via endosymbiotic gene transfer  <cit> . therefore nannochloropsis exhibit an ancient feature, as is in the case of phytophthora. on the other hand, the rrn <dig> gene which encodes the 5s rrna component was lost in nannochloropsis and thalassiosira mt genomes , suggesting structural diversity in mitochondrial translation systems of stramenopiles.

one prominent feature shaping organelle evolution is the targeting of certain nuclear-encoded proteins to organelles, which functionally complement the reduced gene content of pt/mt genomes  <cit> . analysis of subcellular localization  of  <dig>  putative proteins in imet <dig> suggested that  <dig> and  <dig>  proteins were targeted to mt and pt, respectively. they mainly include trna synthetases, ribosomal proteins, dna polymerases, eukaryotic translation factors, transcription factors, tata-box binding proteins and atp synthases. these proteins might participate in the transcription and translation of organelle-encoding genes. in addition,  <dig> pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins  were annotated, with six  targeting to mt and five  to pt. in higher plants pprs were likely involved in rna editing, a process of post-transcriptional modification of rna primary sequences through nucleotide deletion, insertion, or modification  <cit> . thus in nannochloropsis these proteins might participate in organelle rna editing, which is an activity that has not been reported in microalgae.

evolution of organelle genomes
organelle-based phylogeny of nannochloropsis
phylogenetic trees based on pt genomes were constructed by maximum-likelihood , maximum parsimony  and neighbor-joining  methods using a dataset of  <dig> conserved proteins  encoded by the pt genomes of four taxa of red algae and  <dig> green-algal taxa . firstly, red- and green-algal pt genomes respectively formed a distinct cluster. secondly, within the red algae lineage, stramenopile species formed a monophyletic cluster. thirdly, nannochloropsis as a representative of eustigmatophyte was closely related to the diatom thalassiosira. similar analysis of the mt genomes using a dataset of seven protein-coding genes  present in the lineages of green and red algae revealed that the stramenopile lineages were clustered despite weak support among nannochloropsis, thalassiosira and heterosigma . thus both pt and mt genomes suggested that nannochloropsis are phylogenetically close to diatoms and brown algae.

evolution of conserved coding regions in organelle genomes
in the coding regions of the seven pt genomes,  <dig>  snps were identified , representing a density of  <dig> snps/kb . each of these  <dig> indels was a triplet of bases, which may not disrupt the open reading frames, reflecting a mechanism by which the cells fine-tune structure and function of encoded proteins. among the snps,  <dig>  were synonymous and  <dig>  nonsynonymous, with a nonsynonymous/synonymous rate of  <dig> .

in the coding region of the seven mt genomes,  <dig>  snps  were identified. the snp density was  <dig> snps/kb , which is about  <dig>  times higher than that of their pt counterparts. similar to pt, indels in mt coding regions did not disrupt the open reading frames. several parameters describing snps were similar between pt and mt, including snp density  and transition/transversion .

to test the selection pressure of organelle protein-coding genes, ratio of nonsynonymous  versus synonymous substitution  was analyzed, which suggested a strong negative selection might have occurred in nannochloropsis organelles. ka/ks of most pt genes were below  <dig>  . among the  <dig> mt-encoded genes, ka/ks were mostly no more than  <dig>  . notably, the mt orf <dig>  and pt psbk  were of the highest ka/ks ratios among all organelle genes. in nannochloropsis, mean evolutionary rates of pt genes  and mt genes  were significantly lower than those of nuclear genes  , suggesting pt genomes have been evolving at a rate 50% and 33% of that of mt and nuclear genomes respectively.

hotspots of structural and sequence polymorphism in plastid and mitochondrial genomes
hotspot of structural polymorphism in plastid genomes
despite the slow evolution of the nannochloropsis organelle genomes, a single hotspot of structural polymorphism was found in the pt genomes. a large inverted repeat , as a canonical structure of pt genome, was present in the vast majority of higher plants and algae studied so far  <cit> . in many stramenopile algae such as h. akashiwo, thalassiosira oceanica and skeletonema costatum, the irs are large in size  and include 17 ~  <dig> genes . however, a pair of short irs  each of  <dig>  ~  <dig>  bp in size was found in each of the nannochloropsis pt genomes , suggesting dramatic ir-size contraction. this may be due to the fewer number of genes harbored in the irs: the ribosomal operon  was present while ribosomal protein and photosystem genes were absent in each of the nannochloropsis strains; moreover, psbv, petj and clpc-i  were present in only a subset of the strains .

interestingly, among the different nannochloropsis species, evolutionary patterns of the two irs  were distinct: irb were highly conserved, while ira were extraordinarily hypervariable. there were three types of ira in nannochloropsis :  type i, found in ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  did not contain a region of petj-psbv-clpc-i.  type ii, found in ccmp <dig>  ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  possessed a petj-psbv-clpc-i that was an exact duplicate of that in irb.  type iii, present in ccmp <dig> and imet <dig>  encompassed a fragmented petj-psbv-clpc-i, which differed from that in irb due to a disruption of open reading frame . the particular type of ira that a given strain carries appeared to correlate with its specific lineage in nannochloropsis genus, suggesting ancient ira-diversifying events that likely have driven the speciation from the common ancestor of present-day nannochloropsis strains.

alignment of type ii and type iii ira  revealed that the structural polymorphism leading to different ira types was mainly due to hyper variation of sequences in two of the genes: clpc-i_ <dig> and psbv_ <dig>  length of the two genes varied greatly as different start and stop codons were adopted among the strains . compared to type ii , two bases were missing in type iii , resulting in a truncated psbv_ <dig>  moreover, clpc-i_ <dig> orfs were altered due to several intragenic insertions and deletions.

in the pt genome of higher plants, the border between ssc, lsc and ir exhibited a large degree of variation, in that many genes located in the junction are often lost and thus ir is reduced  <cit> . ir is important in higher plants because  it might stabilize ptdna organizations  <cit> ,  it could mediate intra-molecular homologous recombination and  it may increase the relative copy number of rrna genes  <cit> . the identification of a variable region located in the junction between ir and ssc in nannochloropsis suggested an evolutionarily conserved link in hypervariable loci between higher plants and microalgae, however their differences are profound :  despite the presence of two ir copies in all higher plants and microalgae studied so far, the structural polymorphism is symmetric in higher plants  yet is strictly asymmetric in nannochloropsis: only ira were found as polymorphic while irb were strictly conserved across all the seven strains tested.  unlike higher plants where the outer-most gene of ir underwent contraction  <cit> , the internal gene of ir underwent contraction in nannochloropsis.  in higher plants the mechanism driving ir expansion/contraction was believed to be gene conversion and double-strand dna breaks based on the observation of recombination points and trna duplication in ir  <cit> ; however these observations were absent in any of the nannochloropsis ir, suggesting a different and previously unappreciated mechanism for ir diversification in microalgae.

single hotspot of structural polymorphism in mitochondrial genomes
a single hotspot of sequence variation was also discovered in mt genomes of the seven nannochloropsis strains . a pair of large repeats , arranged as direct repeats, was found in n. gaditana ccmp <dig> and n. salina ccmp <dig>  however only one such copy was present in each of the other strains . each of these regions was amplified by long-range pcr and fully sequenced to confirm the copy number variation.

interestingly, in n. gaditana ccmp <dig> and n. salina ccmp <dig> mt genomes, each copy in the pair of large repeats harbors one intron-free cox <dig> . such a duplication producing two 99%-identical copies of cox <dig> was not found in either diatoms or brown algae. in diatom mt genomes , a single copy of cox <dig>  contained orfs-harboring introns  <cit> , while in brown algae  a single intron-less cox <dig> was present  <cit> . therefore the observed direct repeats that harbor cox <dig> was likely due to a duplication event in nannochloropsis before the branching point of n. gaditana and n. salina . whether the event conveyed any biological consequence to the lineage is unknown.

strategy for sensitive and reliable intragenus phylotyping
inter-species markers
molecular markers  are a powerful taxonomy tool as compared to morphology-based classification  <cit> . the seven pairs of complete pt and mt genomes in nannochloropsis enable the first exhaustive search and full assessment of organelle genes for introgenus phylotyping in microalgae. a pt  genome based reference phylogenetic tree was first constructed based on the concatenated nucleotide sequences of all protein-coding genes on the pt  genomes of the seven nannochloropsis strains. then each orthologous set of the intragenic and intergenic sequences from mt and pt genomes was extracted  for construction of individual sequence based phylogenetic trees . those orthologous sequence-sets consistent with the reference trees were analyzed further for their sensitivity and specificity in phylotyping. the euclidean distance between two trees  was used to quantify the similarity of the encoded phylogeny .

a total of  <dig> candidate phylogenetic markers were identified whose nucleotide-sequence-based phylogenetic trees were consistent with the reference trees . forty-nine potential markers provided on average  <dig>  times higher resolution  than the seven commonly used phylogenetic markers  in the interspecies taxonomy . of these  <dig> candidates, twelve exhibited higher sensitivity than its <dig>  which is the most commonly used microalgal phylogenetic marker at present and in effect provided the highest resolution among presently used phylogenetic markers in microalgae . among these  <dig> markers, eight belonged to coding regions and another four to noncoding regions. those encoded by mt included rps <dig>  rps <dig>  rpl <dig>  rpl <dig>  orf <dig>  rpl <dig> and rps14-atp <dig> while those encoded by pt were ycf <dig>  clpa, ycf34-psbd, trnq-groel and trnl-trnw. among them, rps14_mt shows the highest resolution with interspecies difference of  <dig> % and the euclidean distance of  <dig>  , representing a sensitivity of  <dig> % higher than its <dig> .

note: “-” indicated that the gene was not encoded by the organelle genomes. *difference = snp/size; **difference between imet <dig> and ccmp531; ***a measure of the similarity between two trees calculated from the two p-distance matrixes that each represents a phylogenetic tree; ****square deviation of the corresponding p-distance between two matrixes.

furthermore, these new sequence markers yielded a phylogeny consistent with the reference trees. among those presently used markers, however, only cox <dig>  produced a phylogeny in consensus with the reference trees . the psba, rbcl, cox <dig> and rrn16_mt are not suitable for distinguishing closely related species due to their low snp-density , especially among n. oceanica , n.oculata ccmp <dig> and n.granulata ccmp <dig> . thus the newly identified candidate markers may be more suitable than current markers for species classification in nannochloropsis.

to test their wider applicability, these new candidate markers  were searched in available organelle genomes from other algal genera: they were rarely present in mt or pt genomes of the green lineage . its <dig> and 18s rrna are universally found and widely used for species-level identification in higher plants and algae, however their resolution is limited as shown in this study. moreover, being localized on the nuclear genomes, its <dig> and 18s rrna genes can become divergent paralogous copies as a result of incomplete concerted evolution and sexual incompatibility among individuals  <cit> . our proposed new organelle markers provide certain advantages: higher discriminatory power, clonal modes of evolution and non-mendelian inheritance  <cit> . our analysis also suggested different microalgal lineages may require different sets of organelle marker genes for reliable and sensitive intragenus phylotyping.

intra-species phylogenetic markers
intraspecies divergence of microalgal genomes can be significant: despite their close phylogenetic relationship, the comparison of nuclear genomes revealed significant differences in coding sequences between the two n. oceanica strains imet <dig> and ccmp <dig> . therefore sensitive and reliable phylogenetic markers for intraspecies phylotyping are crucial. we tested the presently used markers and the candidate species-level markers identified above on the two n. oceanica strains imet <dig> and ccmp <dig>  all presently used phylogenetic markers were not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish imet <dig> and ccmp <dig> due to their low snp density . in fact, between imet <dig> and ccmp <dig>  merely  <dig> and  <dig> snps were found in pt and mt genomes respectively. moreover the snp loci were physically distributed in a scattered manner, confounding their utilization via pcr followed by sequencing for phylogenetic analysis .

to identify the most variable regions between imet <dig> and ccmp <dig>  the full lengths of imet <dig> and ccmp <dig> organelle genomes were aligned. only three highly variable regions  were found , each with at least  <dig> snps per  <dig>  bases. there were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> snps in rps11-nad <dig>  rps <dig> and cox2-rrn <dig>  respectively and all these snps were synonymous substitutions. on imet <dig> and ccmp <dig>  the combined sequences of these three regions provided at least two-fold higher resolution than the above-mentioned presently used and new markers . thus combination of the three regions, as multiple-locus sequence typing  markers, can provide higher resolution for intraspecies discrimination.

note: “-” indicated that the mutation was located at a non-protein-coding region.

to further test whether these mlst markers can be used for intraspecies phylogenetic reconstruction, we pcr-amplified and sequenced the three candidate mlst loci in ccmp <dig>  another n.oceanica strain whose nuclear genome along with partial plastid and mitochondrial genomes was recently released  <cit> . despite significant divergence in the encoded proteome between imet <dig> and ccmp <dig> , one of the presently used markers and our newly proposed nannochloropsis species-level markers were able to discriminate the two strains. however, one high-quality snp  was found in the cox2-rrn16_mt region of the imet <dig> and ccmp <dig> mt genomes. thus our proposed mlst marker-set consisting of rps11_mt-nad <dig>  rps3_mt and cox2-rrn16_mt, were able to discriminate the three closely related n. oceanica strains . moreover the reconstructed phylogeny based on the marker-set was consistent with that based on the whole-genome comparison . these findings thus suggested a strategy for high-resolution intra-species typing of microalgae.

on the other hand, a total of  <dig> simple short repeats  were identified in the organelle genomes of imet <dig> and ccmp <dig>  eleven of these ssrs were from pt genomes and  <dig> from mt genomes . between the two strains,  <dig> of the ssrs were shared. however two strain-specific ssrs were found in imet <dig> pt genome: one poly   <dig> mononucleotide intergenic sequence between psbv and clpb and one multiple   <dig> dinucleotide sequence located in trnk-trng. moreover a specific poly   <dig> mononucleotide genic sequence located in rps <dig> was found specifically in ccmp <dig> mt genome. ssrs offer potential advantage for strain discrimination as they are locus-specific, pcr-friendly and highly polymorphic  <cit> . thus the three specific ssrs identified can be used to identify ccmp <dig> and imet <dig>  as ssr loci can be strain-specific, a searchable database of microalgal ssrs such as those reported here can be established for high-resolution microalgal strain-typing.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete organelle genome sequences of seven strains from six nannochloropsis species enabled the first systematic analysis of organelle evolution within a microalgal genus. both pt and mt genomes of nannochloropsis were among the most compact known in stramenopiles, with the absence of introns, tight packaging of genes and a paucity of disperse repeats. being highly conserved in gene content, gene size and gene order and strongly negatively selected in protein-coding regions, the pt and mt genomes were evolving at a rate 33% and 66%, respectively, of that occurred in nuclear genomes.

in nannochloropsis, the pt genome diversification was driven by asymmetric evolution of two copies of inverted repeats , while mt genome evolution was shaped by a single evolution hotspot varied in copy-number of a  <dig> kb-long, cox1-harboring repeat. genomic engineering of plastids, the primary energy production site in the cell, offers many opportunities to improve algal feedstock productivity. transgene integration into a plastid genome may occur via homologous recombination of flanking sequences used in vectors. however, plastid transformation vectors are usually species-specifically designed, leading to low efficiency and even intractability in other species  <cit> . the high degree of conservation of pt and mt genomes suggested the feasibility of “universal vector” based on the highly conserved intergenic spacer regions. on the other hand, discovery of the evolutionary hotspots  and the mechanism underlying the polymorphism should guide rational genetic engineering of plastids for possible phenotypic trait improvement and even for de novo design of organelle genomes for a synthetic algal cell  <cit> .

this organelle phylogenome dataset, the most comprehensive for a microalgal genus to-date, also provided a first opportunity to evaluate existing phylogenetic reconstruction and strain-typing strategies in microalgae. our analysis showed that, despite their wide uses in distinguishing among different microalgal genera, existing organelle gene markers  and nuclear gene markers  have limited power in distinguishing closely related species due to the low snp densities in these genes. exhaustive searches and evaluation of all coding and non-coding sequences on the organelle genomes enabled us to propose the strategy for intra-genus phylotyping of microalgae:  twelve sequence markers of higher sensitivity than its <dig>  for interspecies phylogeny,  genus-specific multi-locus sequence tag of rps11_mt-nad <dig>  rps3_mt and cox2-rrn16_mt for intraspecies phylogenetic analysis, and  several ssr loci for reliable strain identification. as a result, new community resources such as databases of genus-specific phylogenetic markers and strain-identifier sequences  should be developed for microalgae. the intragenus analysis strategy developed in this study may be generally applicable to other microalgal genera. as screening, development and protection of microalgae frequently demand species-, strain- and even isolate-level resolution, our findings may be valuable to the expanding algal biotechnology community.
