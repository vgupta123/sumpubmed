BACKGROUND
the brazilian citrus industry accounts for 30% of sweet orange production and 85% of exports of frozen-concentrated orange juice in the world, despite the large number of pests and diseases that affect the brazilian orchards. among these diseases, citrus variegated chlorosis , caused by the bacterium xylella fastidiosa, costs around  <dig> million us dollars a year to chemically control the bacterial vectors and for replanting new orchards  <cit> .

the symptoms of this disease are associated with the blockage of xylem vessels by x. fastidiosa biofilm, leading to increased water stress and decreased nutrients in the diseased plant  <cit> .

citrus species show varying responses to cvc. while the sweet orange  is very susceptible, the ponkan mandarin  is considered resistant because it shows no symptoms, yet the bacteria can be isolated from the plants at 30 days after inoculation. however, after 60 days of inoculation the bacteria cannot be isolated from the plant. the resistance of mandarin is not related to the number and/or diameter of xylem vessels, suggesting that resistance is caused by active defense responses  <cit> . based on this, the pattern of gene expression in ponkan mandarin was assessed by sequencing expressed sequence tags in mandarins inoculated with x. fastidiosa at  <dig> and 60 days after infection. the results revealed differential expression patterns for several defense-related genes of the salicylic acid , jasmonate , and ethylene  signaling pathways  <cit> . these results indicate a crosstalk between regulatory pathways that control different cellular processes in the mandarin-x. fastidiosa interaction. however, it is unclear whether these pathways are activated during the initial response of ponkan mandarin to this phytopathogen. thus, the present study aimed to evaluate which genes are activated in the preliminary stages of infection, as this phase may involve an important strategy for avoiding pathogen establishment and colonization, and consequently the progress of the disease. identifying these defense genes could be an important step towards obtaining sweet orange resistant varieties through breeding or genetic engineering.

RESULTS
overview of rna-seq analysis
in recent years the number of works using global expression analysis to study plant-pathogen interactions has grown considerably. by comparing specific mrnas present in different tissues, such as infected or not infected, differentially expressed genes can be identified and their functions inferred.

in the present study, we used rna-seq to analyze the differential expression of ponkan mandarin mrnas one day after x. fastidiosa infection . the presence or absence of bacteria in the plants used in this analysis was confirmed by real-time quantitative pcr  . three biological replicates for each condition were selected for performing transcriptome analyses.

rna-seq generated  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> single end reads of 101 bp for the non-infected and infected libraries, respectively. tophat was used to align the reads to the citrus clementina reference genome, with approximately 74% of success. the expression level of  <dig>  coding sequences was quantified using the software cufflink. a total of  <dig>  transcripts showed significant variation in expression by cuffdiff analysis:  <dig> were induced and  <dig> were repressed  in the infected ponkan mandarin .

the differentially expressed genes were categorized using gene ontology . based on similarity, transcripts were distributed into different categories of biological processes . the prominent functional categories for both induced and repressed genes were related to metabolic process, followed by cellular process, response stimulus, biological regulation, and localization . the majority of induced genes are involved in the formation of secondary xylem, cell wall, lignin, hormone synthesis, and detoxification. on the other hand, the repressed genes are related to growth, cell wall degradation, cell wall loosening, cell differentiation, and development. a complete list of x. fastidiosa-modulated pathways for ponkan mandarin data sets is shown in additional file  <dig> 

induction of a pamp - triggered immunity  – like response in ponkan mandarin
in plants, pattern recognition receptors  perform the first level of microbial recognition, perceiving molecular signatures characteristic of a whole class of microbes, which are termed pathogen-associated  molecular patterns   <cit> . pamp recognition leads to a chain of signaling events broadly referred to as general defense responses in plants  <cit> . stimulation of prrs is a key step in the early stages of pti. we identified two upregulated genes , which are similar to a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase  in arabidopsis , belonging to the lrr-xii subfamily, of which ef-tu and flagellin sensing  <dig> receptors are members  <cit> . upregulation of these genes suggests that pamps from x. fastidiosa might be perceived by prrs in ponkan mandarin and could trigger the pti response. after this recognition, the plant modulates the expression of defense genes as well as initiating metabolic rearrangements, and ultimately activates basal resistance to potential pathogens  <cit> . another upregulated gene in ponkan mandarin encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein , which is associated with different functions such as cell differentiation, plant growth, development, and mainly disease resistance  <cit>  .

a gene encoding a coiled-coil motif nucleotide-binding site–leucine-rich repeat  protein was upregulated in ponkan mandarin challenged with x. fastidiosa . cc-nbs-lrr is a cytoplasmic receptor normally involved in responses triggered after recognition of avr proteins secreted by the pathogen. however, this bacterium does not have the type iii secretion apparatus or avr proteins  <cit> . this leads us to believe that this receptor may be involved in perception of damage-associated molecular patterns , because the recognition of cytoplasmic danger signals depends on cytoplasmic sensors like nb-lrr resistance proteins  <cit> . this hypothesis is consistent with x. fastidiosa’s ability to produce danger molecules by degrading plant cell walls  <cit> . however, this hypothesis needs to be further investigated.

a main feature of the pti response is strengthening of the cell wall  <cit> . many genes related with cell wall modification were upregulated in ponkan mandarin infected with x. fastidiosa, which reinforced our hypothesis that pti is involved in this early response.

genes related to secondary metabolism and the cell wall
in this study, we observed a significant change in expression of genes involved in secondary metabolism, and cell wall biosynthesis and modification in ponkan mandarin infected with x. fastidiosa. these genes were mapped using mapman to generate a representative overview .

in response to x. fastidiosa infection, ponkan mandarin appears to activate genes for the formation and alteration of secondary xylem cells as a defense mechanism. induction of the transcription factor as <dig>  which has a myb domain  was also observed. it is suggested that the abundance of myb proteins in the xylem could be involved in transcriptional regulation of the formation of the secondary xylem  <cit>  . furthermore, a myo gene , which encodes actin, was strongly induced . many studies suggest that actin displays a similar expression pattern to microtubules, which are suggested to determine the location for deposition of the secondary cell wall, cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, and proteins  <cit> . another transcription factor induced in this study was myb <dig> , which is probably involved in the regulation of flavonoids biosynthesis and lignification  <cit>  . to corroborate these observations, we verified the activation of genes related to phenylpropanoid and flavonoids biosynthesis, which act as anti-pathogenic molecules  <cit> . some of them such as phenylalanine ammonium lyase are involved in lignin biosynthesis . in addition to lignification, callose deposition is also an important defense mechanism in plants and one callose synthase  was induced in ponkan mandarin infected with x. fastidiosa . additionally, genes encoding cellulose synthases  were significantly induced, such as cesa <dig> and cesa <dig>  which are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of the xylem cell wall  <cit> . among the repressed genes it is remarkable the presence of those encoding proteins related to cell wall degradation . these results indicate that the molecular defense response of ponkan mandarin against x. fastidiosa involves the participation of genes related to cell wall biosynthesis. this could represent an important strategy of the plant for restrict the movement of x. fastidiosa through the xylem cells.

hormone related-genes in the ponkan mandarin defense response
after pathogen recognition, plants transmit signals to activate defense responses. this transmission can be performed by secondary messengers, such as g-proteins, ca2+, reactive oxygen species , nitric oxide, and hormones  <cit> . genes associated with calcium signaling , g-proteins  and ros  were all upregulated in infected plants . in addition, hormone related-genes induced in ponkan mandarin infected with x. fastidiosa were associated with ja, aba and auxin. ja and aba pathways are important regulators of expression of defense genes and have been identified downstream in pti  <cit> . the gene encoding lipoxygenase , a key enzyme in the synthesis of ja  <cit> , was induced in ponkan mandarin infected by x. fastidiosa . in addition to the defense response, this hormone activates secondary metabolism in the plant in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . interestingly, lox was also upregulated in ponkan mandarin in later stage of x. fastidiosa infection  <cit> . these observations highlight the importance of the ja pathway during the defense response.

upregulated genes in ponkan mandarin 24 h after infection with x. fastidiosa compared with the control.

with regard to aba-related genes, ap <dig> , nced <dig> , and ccd <dig>  were induced in response to x.fastidiosa infection . ap <dig> is involved in the activation of genes related to aba biosynthesis  <cit> , while nced <dig> and ccd <dig> are associated with biosynthesis and transport of this hormone, respectively. additionally the aip <dig> gene  was repressed  and this gene encodes an e <dig> ligase that negatively regulates aba signaling by targeting abi <dig>  a central regulator of this pathway, for degradation  <cit> .

so the repression of this gene strengthens the idea that aba biosynthesis is activated in ponkan mandarin in response to x. fastidiosa infection.

other hormone related-genes upregulated in ponkan mandarin in response to infection by x. fastidiosa were associated with the auxin signaling pathway . indole-3-acetic acid  is the main auxin in plants, controlling many important physiological processes, including cell growth and division, tissue differentiation and response to light  <cit> . in addition, auxin is also associated with increased susceptibility to biotrophic microorganisms, because it promotes loosening of the cell wall and thus potentiates pathogen growth  <cit> . many bacteria produce iaa as a strategy to interfere with the plant auxin pathway to facilitate their infection  <cit> . however, our results showed the induction of several genes involved in the activation of the auxin signaling pathway in a resistant plant after infection, suggesting that the plants do not recognize x. fastidiosa as a biotrophic pathogen. the map locations of modulated auxin genes found in this study are shown in representative schematics of auxin synthesis and degradation . at high concentrations, auxin promotes an association between auxin/iaa  and an f-box protein known as transport inhibitor response  <dig> . this complex activates the e <dig> ligase that leads to degradation of aux/iaa, allowing the release of auxin responsive factors  from the complex  <cit> . a gene encoding aux/iaa  was the most upregulated in our analysis. ring e <dig> subunit , a hect subunit  and e3/scf/fbox  genes, which are all part of the proteasome complex, were also induced. additionally, an ubiquitin-specific protease  was also significantly induced in the infected plant . this enzyme is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and plays a critical role by cleaving ubiquitinated proteins  <cit> . furthermore, two arfs  related-genes and a gene encoding big, which is involved in polar auxin transport and has an essential function in auxin signaling  <cit>  were upregulated .

many studies have reported that auxin promotes susceptibility to bacterial diseases  <cit> . however, this affirmation is only true for biotrophic organisms: auxin signaling is an important component involved in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . auxin signaling is upregulated in ponkan mandarin in response to x. fastidiosa and this plant is resistant to this pathogen; therefore, we speculated that in the early stage of infection ponkan mandarin recognizes x. fastidiosa as a necrotrophic organism, even though this bacterium does not cause massive destruction of host tissue. this is consistent with the direct injection of the bacteria by the insect vector into the xylem vessels, which is composed mainly of dead cells, and the fact that x. fastidiosa is able to degrade plant cell wall, which is an important factor for its colonization in susceptible plants  <cit> . therefore, substantial tissue destruction is not necessary to trigger necrotroph-related responses mediated by x. fastidiosa in the resistant plant host.

the evidence in this paper indicates that activation of the auxin signaling pathway does not promoting susceptibility of ponkan mandarin after infection with the bacterium. the involvement of this hormone in pathogen susceptibility disease development appears to include rapid elongation of plant tissues by increasing the extensibility of the cell wall  <cit> . proteins that participate in acid-induced cell wall extension are endo-β- <dig> -glucanases , xyloglucan endotransglycosylases , and expansins  <cit> . we did not observed induction of a major set of these proteins. in fact some of them such as xets  and expansin  were repressed in ponkan mandarin in response to x. fastidiosa, suggesting that auxin signaling related genes found in this work are not primarily promoting cell expansion . on the other hand, auxin synergistically with jasmonic acid/ethylene-signaling is required for necrotrophic resistance. in addition some members of arf positively regulate camalexin biosynthesis resulting in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . this defense system, involving the interaction between auxin and ja signaling pathways, which probably occurs in ponkan mandarin, given the significant induction of genes associated with both signaling pathways. camalexin is produced through the tryptophan pathway and in our analysis two genes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan, dehydroquinate-shikimate dehydrogenase  and mapk  <dig> , were induced in ponkan mandarin, suggesting that camalexin biosynthesis may be induced in response to x. fastidiosa infection. taken together all these evidences suggest us that the resistant ponkan mandarin recognizes x. fastidiosa in early stage of infection as a necrotrophic pathogen.

to confirm that auxin signaling related genes are indeed upregulated only in ponkan mandarin in response to x. fastidiosa infection we also evaluated the expression of auxin marker-genes by rt-qpcr in pera sweet orange susceptible variety and in ponkan mandarin at one day after x. fastidiosa infection. as shown in figure  <dig>  all auxin related-genes were significantly induced only in ponkan mandarin. in pera sweet orange, the genes were significantly repressed  or showed no significant change . this result evidences that auxin is induced as a resistance response against x. fastidiosa during the early stage of infection. recognition of pamps or damps that somehow resemble necrotrophic pathogens may mediate this response. however, this recognition occurs mainly during the early stage of infection since we observed a gradual decrease in expression of auxin related-genes along the time course of infection . after 21 days, no auxin related-gene was expressed, whereas expression of salicylic acid  marker-gene increased . this result agrees with de souza et al.  <cit>  where an upregulation of sa related-genes was observed in ponkan mandarin at 30 days after x. fastidiosa inoculation. after this time point, the bacterial population decreases to a point where it could not be isolated  <cit> . these results suggest that the resistant plant changes its mechanism of defense during x. fastidiosa infection: the initial response involves the participation of auxin while later on sa becomes important. it is to note that the change occurs approximately at the time when x. fastidiosa forms a structured biofilm. in this growth condition this bacterium expresses specific genes and proteins necessary for its adaptation and pathogenicity in the host  <cit> . therefore other proteins expressed in biofilm condition could be later recognized by the plant. nevertheless, how the resistant plant indeed recognizes x. fastidiosa to trigger different pathways in the resistance response remains to be discovered. other downstream defense-genes upregulated in ponkan mandarin after x. fastidiosa infection are represented at the table  <dig>  these genes might contribute to increase the resistance response in ponkan mandarin to x. fastidiosa culminating in its elimination in the plant.

to confirm the participation of different genes related to pathogen recognition, cell wall synthesis, and hormone signaling pathways in the mandarin resistance response, we also tested their expression in pera sweet orange. the analysis confirmed that genes encoding lrr-rlk and cc-nbs-lrr , ap <dig> , myo and cesa <dig>  were not only specifically induced in mandarin but also repressed in sweet orange .

validation of rna-seq data by rt-qpcr
rt-qpcr was used to validate the rna-seq data. twelve genes involved in different biological processes were selected . similar expression patterns were observed for all genes evaluated by both techniques . additionally, a high spearman’s rho value  indicated a good correlation between the fold change from rna-seq experiments and rt-qpcr. these results confirmed the reliability and accuracy of the rna-seq data in this study .

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrated that the defense response of ponkan mandarin to x. fastidiosa involves induction of genes related to pamp receptors, cell wall synthesis, and aba, ja and auxin signaling pathways, which will probably culminate in the induction of other defense-related genes. we also hypothesize that ponkan mandarin initially recognizes x. fastidiosa as a necrotrophic pathogen, inducing genes related to the auxin signaling pathway and later it changes the response to a biotrophic pathogen.

the genes found in this work are important tools to be used in breeding programs to accelerate the selection of hybrid from c. reticulata and c. sinensis carrying defense responses from mandarin. moreover these genes can be also used for genetic engineering aiming the development of resistant sweet orange varieties.
