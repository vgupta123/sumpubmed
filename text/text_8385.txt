BACKGROUND
milk is a unique biological fluid consumed by mammalian infants. it contains many macro- and micro-nutrients that are essential for the growth and development of the newborn  <cit> . in addition, a diverse cocktail of bioactive factors, such as oligosaccharides, antibodies and nucleotides in milk, play immune, prebiotic and protective functions in the infant gut . oligosaccharides are the third most abundant component in human milk and they are present as lactose-derived free forms and protein and lipid bound glycoconjugates  <cit> . milk oligosaccharides can withstand the ph of the stomach and virtually all of them resist enzymatic digestion in the gastro-intestinal tract  <cit> . recent studies on human milk oligosaccharides  and glycoconjugates demonstrate both local and systemic beneficial effects to the suckling neonate . milk oligosaccharides provide protection against enteric pathogen infections by antibacterial activity, competing with pathogen binding sites and enhancing the binding of iga with pathogens  <cit> . another protective function of milk oligosaccharides is that the intact oligosaccharides serve as a prebiotic substrate enabling enrichment of bifidobacterium species in the infant gut thereby consuming available nutrients and lowering the gut ph  <cit> .

bifidobacterium species were first observed over 100 years ago in feces of breastfed infants and later research suggested breast milk contains special molecules defined as “bifidus factors” that stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria  <cit> . culture-based studies over the years and high-throughput metagenomic studies have demonstrated that bifidobacterium is a commonly enriched member of the intestinal microbiota of breastfed infants  <cit> . research in the last decade has provided a mechanistic basis for that enrichment whereby hmos and glycoconjugates serve as prebiotics selectively promoting bifidobacteria  <cit> . indeed, genomic analysis of a prototypical infant borne bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  which grows well on hmo, revealed a single cluster of genes encoding milk oligosaccharide metabolism suggesting co-evolution of this strain with human milk  <cit> . analysis of other infant-borne strains of b. bifidum, b. longum subsp. longum  and b. breve shown to grow on hmo  <cit>  also possessed specific milk glycan transporters and glycosyl hydrolases linked to milk glycan consumption  <cit> .

the ability of bifidobacteria to bind and interact with the intestinal epithelium plays an important role in gut colonization and modulation of host immune system  <cit> . previous research has proven that different species of bifidobacteria exhibit different capacities to adhere to the intestinal epithelium and to stimulate the gastrointestinal immunity . our research group recently showed that the adhesion rate of bifidobacteria to the intestinal epithelial cells  changes according to the carbon source supplied in their growth medium  <cit> . when comparing b. infantis atcc  <dig> grown in hmo and lactose, the hmo grown b. infantis had a significantly higher rate of adhesion to both caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> cells  <cit> . this work was subsequently confirmed by kavanaugh et al. showing that growth of b. infantis atcc  <dig> on 6’sialyllactose  also resulted in increased adherence to cultured iecs  <cit> . previous research also showed the ability of bifidobacteria to induce the anti-inflammatory capacity of iecs. for example, colon organ cultures exposed to b. infantis showed reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  <cit> . in another study, interferon gamma was reduced in the peyer’s patches of mice fed b. longum  <cit> .

there are few documented studies on changes in the interaction between bifidobacteria and iecs as a function of the carbon source of the bacterial growth medium. microarray studies in our laboratory have previously shown that incubation of hmo with b. infantis altered gene expresssion in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . chichlowski et al. observed that hmo-fed b. infantis tightens cell-cell junctions, increases the level of cytokine il- <dig> while decreasing the level of pro-inflammatory tnfα in caco- <dig> cells  <cit> .

in the current study, we sought to understand the effects of hmo-fed bifidobacteria on the gene expression of intestinal cells on a genome-wide basis. we investigated the effects of two bifidobacterial strains fed different carbon sources—hmo, glucose , or lactose —on the gene expression of caco- <dig> cells using rna sequencing . due to their dominance in breastfed infant feces  <cit>  and efficient consumption of hmos, b. infantis and b. breve were selected for the study. the two strains selected were b. infantis atcc  <dig>  which is the current model to study genetic adaptations to growth on human milk  <cit>  and b. breve sc <dig>  a strain that also grows vigorously on hmos  <cit> . our group has also shown that hmo consumption by b. infantis triggers expression of surface binding proteins that interact with intestinal cell surface structures  <cit> . we hypothesized that hmo-grown bifidobacteria, relative to those grown on lac or glu will have enhanced adhesion and will alter gene expression in caco- <dig> cells consistent with a protective modulatory mechanism in the host intestine.

RESULTS
adhesion of bifidobacteria grown in different carbon sources to caco- <dig> cells
several studies have demonstrated the ability of b. infantis strains to grow on hmo as the sole carbon source  <cit>  and a recent study in our laboratory identified three strains of b. breve  that can also efficiently consume hmo  <cit> . based on the results of this study and their exclusive presence in infant feces, b. breve sc <dig> was selected for the adhesion assay. different adhesion percentages were observed between the two bifidobacterial species. the levels of adhesion in b. infantis atcc  <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % and in b. breve sc <dig> it ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . binding percentages obtained for b. infantis atcc  <dig> were very similar to that reported previously  <cit> . however, the current study included the glu-grown b. infantis atcc  <dig>  which showed the lowest percentage of adhesion. compared to b. infantis atcc  <dig>  b. breve sc <dig> presented lower binding efficiency to caco- <dig> cells. the highest binding percentage  of b. breve sc <dig> was observed for lac-grown bacteria and there were numerical trends among treatments and the adhesion efficiency, however no statistical significant differences were observed among them. studies of different b. breve strains grown in mrs media have shown very low adhesion percentages to caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . in the current study, we have observed lower binding of b. breve sc <dig>  regardless of the carbon source.fig.  <dig> binding of b. breve sc <dig> and b. infantis atcc  <dig> to caco- <dig> cell monolayers, expressed as percentage of initial bacterial input. statistical analysis was performed by anova, and binding percentages were compared to lac. * p <  <dig> 



gene expression analysis of caco- <dig> cells in response to bifidobacteria grown on different substrates
in order to examine if bifidobacteria grown in different carbon sources elicit a change in the intestinal cellular responses, we examined the transcriptome of the caco- <dig> cells using rna-seq. this resulted in 20– <dig> million reads per sample and only uniquely mapped reads were considered in the analysis. as described by bentley et al.  <cit>  and ramskold et al.  <cit>  a threshold rpkm  value of  <dig>  rpkm was established to balance the number of false positives and false negatives and to define potential meaningful gene expression. there were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  genes expressed in caco- <dig> cells exposed to b. breve sc <dig> grown in glu, hmo and lac respectively. caco- <dig> cells exposed to b. infantis grown in glu, hmo and lac had  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed genes respectively. summaries of gene expression intensities for all transcripts in all samples are provided in the ncbi geo repository, accessions gse <dig> and gse <dig> 

effect of carbon source consumption by bifidobacteria on caco- <dig> gene expression
to determine the specific effect of carbon source on caco- <dig> gene expression, differential expression between carbon sources were analyzed individually in each bifidobacteria strain experiment. as expected, bifidobacteria grown in different carbon sources elicited significant changes  in expression of genes in caco- <dig> cells. the number of differentially expressed genes in caco- <dig> cells as a function of carbon source is summarized in table  <dig>  during co-incubation with b. breve sc <dig>  the expression of  <dig> caco- <dig> cell genes was upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated by hmo compared to glu, while  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated by hmo compared to lac. comparison between glu vs lac grown samples of b. breve sc <dig> yielded  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> downregulated genes by lac.table  <dig> summary of the rna-seq gene expression analysis. numbers of genes that had significant expression changes in caco- <dig> cells

co-incubation of caco- <dig> cells with b. infantis atcc  <dig> also modified caco- <dig> gene expression as a function of carbon source . there were  <dig> genes upregulated and  <dig> genes downregulated by hmo compared to glu and upregulation of  <dig> genes and downregulation of  <dig> genes by hmo compared to lac. when comparing glu vs lac grown b. infantis atcc  <dig>   <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> genes were downregulated by lac . list of these genes with significant changes in expression and their rpkm values are provided in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

to compare the differential effects of bifidobacterial strain and carbon source on the caco- <dig> cell transcriptome, between-strain differential gene expression was examined for each of the three carbon sources. the number of caco- <dig> genes differentially expressed in response to co-incubation with b. infantis compared with b. breve for each carbon source is listed in fig.  <dig>  for example, there are  <dig> caco- <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in response to glu-fed b. infantis compared to glu-fed b. breve that are not also differentially expressed in response to hmo- or lac-fed strains. the carbon source of glucose elicits the biggest bifidobacteria strain effect on caco- <dig> gene expression. meanwhile, the use of hmo as a carbon source appears to reduce the difference between strains. if the choice of carbon source were unimportant, the intersection of the gene expression results  should be quite high. however, that is not the case. the intersection of the three carbon sources is rather small , suggesting that the choice of carbon source definitively affects caco- <dig> response to different bifidobacteria strains. thus, the differential response of caco- <dig> cells to the two different bifidobacteria strains is highly dependent on the carbon source.fig.  <dig> number of caco- <dig> genes differentially expressed between b. infantis atcc  <dig> and b. breve sc <dig> in response to different substrates . venn diagram prepared using eulerape  <cit> 



predicted consequences of bifidobacterial carbon source on caco- <dig> function
to investigate the functional consequences of bifidobacteria carbon source on caco- <dig> cell gene expression, functional annotation clustering was performed using david  <cit>  for each input gene list . these results were filtered to obtain terms with statistically significant enrichment for each comparison . in the co-incubation of b. breve sc <dig> with caco- <dig> cells , genes that were downregulated by hmo, relative to glu, were enriched with the annotation term go:0008009 ~ chemokine activity. several other annotation terms related to inflammation and immunity were also significantly enriched among genes downregulated by hmo grown b. breve sc <dig> . there was no significant enrichment of annotation terms for genes up-regulated by hmo grown, relative to glu grown, b. breve sc <dig>  likewise, genes downregulated by hmo-fed b. breve sc <dig>  relative to lac-fed, were also enriched with the annotation term “chemokine activity.”table  <dig> enriched annotation terms with significant changes in caco- <dig> cells exposed to b. breve sc <dig> grown on different carbon sources

term1: annotation terms with enrichment score ≥ <dig> , p value  ≤ <dig>  and globally corrected enrichment benjamini p-value  ≤ <dig>  were selected



functional enrichment analysis of the caco- <dig> cell genes modulated by b. infantis  also showed the modulation of “chemokine activity” by hmo. relative to lac-fed b. infantis, hmo-fed b. infantis downregulated caco- <dig> cell genes associated with “chemokine activity.” however, this difference was not seen in the comparison between hmo-fed and glu-fed b. infantis. there was no significant enrichment of annotation terms for genes upregulated by hmo-fed b. infantis compared to either glu- or lac-fed. in summary, consumption of hmo by two different bifidobacterial strains was associated with downregulation of inflammation-related signaling in caco- <dig> cells.

necrotizing enterocolitis  is a very common emergency occurring in pre-term infants. previous studies have shown that nec can be prevented by probiotics perhaps in part because they modulate the immune mediated gene expression in enterocytes  <cit> . given that the functional enrichment analyses and the heat maps  pointed to chemokine-related changes in gene expression in the caco- <dig> cells exposed to bifidobacteria grown in different carbon sources, we specifically investigated genes involved in inflammation. expression of cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> were downregulated by hmo feeding of both strains of bifidobacteria . another cell adhesion and chemotaxis target gene that has shown higher expression in nec is icam <dig>  <cit>  and interestingly this gene was significantly downregulated in caco- <dig> cells exposed to both b. infantis atcc  <dig> and b. breve sc <dig> grown in hmo .fig.  <dig> expression of cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> genes in a

aberrant modulation of gut bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease   <cit> . therefore, we screened candidate genes for ulcerative colitis  and crohn’s disease for significant changes in expression in the rna-seq data. numerous candidate genes were downregulated in caco- <dig> cells exposed to b. infantis atcc  <dig> and/or b. breve sc <dig> grown on hmo . icam <dig>  which is known to be highly expressed in both crohn’s disease and uc relative to controls  <cit> , was downregulated in caco- <dig> cells exposed to either hmo-fed bifidobacterial strain.table  <dig> known candidate genes for crohn’s disease and ibd with significant changes of expression in caco- <dig> cells exposed to bifidobacteria strains grown on different carbon sources

discussion
commensal bifidobacteria have been associated with regulation of intestinal inflammation  <cit> . bifidobacteria are normal residents of the human intestine, commonly found in the infant gut and particularly enriched in the intestine of breastfed infants  <cit> . b. infantis and b. breve are often dominant members of the breastfed infant gut microbiota  <cit>  and have been linked to a modulatory role in intestinal inflammation and regulation of the immune response at the gut associated lymphoid tissue  <cit> . it is well accepted that bifidobacteria overrepresentation in nursing infants brings benefits to the neonate  <cit> .

one of the major driving forces that underlie bifidobacterial predominance in infants is the ability to consume hmos. in a previous study, we demonstrated that growth on hmos significantly increased the binding of b. infantis, but not b. bifidum, to intestinal cells  <cit> . consistent with that study, we found that hmo-grown b. infantis showed significant adherence to caco- <dig> cells. more recently, we have characterized unique strains of b. breve that grow well on hmo  <cit>  which led us to hypothesize that these strains might also exhibit an hmo-induced binding phenotype. however, unlike b. infantis, b. breve sc <dig> showed low percentage of binding with caco- <dig> cells, regardless of the growth medium. previous studies demonstrate that the adherence of b. breve to caco- <dig> cells is strain-specific and that adherence of a high-adhering strain of b. breve is almost totally abolished with trypsin or pronase treatment of the culture  <cit> . in the current protocol we have discarded the spent culture and this may explain the low binding percentage of b. breve sc <dig>  an interesting future study design would be to include the spent culture of bifidobacteria in caco- <dig> binding assays. the transcriptomic changes of caco- <dig> cells evoked by b. breve may result from the constitutive expression of surface structures or the production of soluble factors. there is evidence that bifidobacteria exert an indirect effect on intestinal inflammation, due to the release of soluble factors that reduce inflammation  <cit> .

taken together, both strain and carbon source affect the binding affinity of bifidobacteria to iecs. in a previous study, we found that hmo-grown b. infantis increased the expression of genes involved in promoting integrity of the barrier function  <cit> . however, that study was a targeted approach in which only a few genes were probed. here, we employed a high-throughput sequencing method to obtain an overview of all gene expression in caco- <dig> cells upon incubation with b. infantis atcc  <dig> and b. breve sc  <dig> grown in different carbon sources. with each bifidobacterial strain, the supplied carbon source—glu, lac, or hmo—significantly affected gene expression in caco- <dig> cells. interestingly, even though the adhesive ability of b. breve was low, it still elicited a significant transcriptional response in caco- <dig> cells, altering even more genes than b. infantis. these observations suggest that mechanisms additional to that of direct binding of b. breve are important to promote gene expression changes in caco- <dig> cells. indirect mechanisms, such as the production of soluble factors by b. breve during interaction with iecs, may underlie the gene expression changes and it should be investigated.

in a non-hypothesis driven assessment of caco- <dig> gene expression in response to bifidobacteria grown on different carbon sources, we found that growth on hmos substrate reduced inflammation-related signaling. the reduced expression of genes related to chemokine activity in the presence of hmo-grown bifidobacteria occurred independent of bifidobacterial strain, suggesting that prebiotic hmo primes bifidobacteria to elicit an anti-inflammatory state in iecs. rna-seq analysis showed significant downregulation of three chemokines in cxcl family: cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  these chemokines play an active role in development of gastrointestinal diseases marked by inflammatory response such as gastritis, necrotizing enterocolitis , ileitis, ulcerative colitis  <cit>  and inflammatory bowel diseases   <cit> . mouse studies have showed an association between higher incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and elevated intestinal expression of cxcl <dig> mrna  <cit> . a recent study where b. infantis was administered to mouse pups that are prone to nec has shown significant downregulation of cxcl <dig> gene in the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . the in vivo blocking of cxcl <dig> has been shown to alleviate inflammation related bowel injuries  <cit> . cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> are positively associated with tumor associated angiogenesis and depletion of these three chemokine factors have inhibited the tumor growth in mice  <cit> . 

given the effect of hmo-grown bifidobacteria on inflammatory related signaling in caco- <dig> cells in this study, we specifically reviewed the caco- <dig> transcriptome data in the context of known candidate genes associated with nec, crohn’s diseases and ulcerative colitis. several candidate genes associated with these bowel diseases are significantly regulated by hmo-grown bifidobacteria . expression of intracellular adhesion molecule- <dig>  was significantly downregulated by b. breve and b. infantis grown in hmo. icam <dig>  located in the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium, is a ligand for neutrophils. icam <dig> facilitates the transepithelial migration of neutrophils and their accumulation in the luminal surface of the intestine, which contributes to mucosal injury leading to conditions such as ulcerative colitis  <cit> . therefore the decreased expression of icam <dig> by b. breve and b. infantis grown in hmo may aid to reduce the risk of nec in infants and inflammatory bowel disease in adults. these results highlight the therapeutic potential to prevent or possibly ameliorate ibd with synbiotics that include both bifidobacteria and milk oligosaccharides.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents an initial assessment of the transcriptomic changes of intestinal epithelial cells evoked by commensal bifidobacteria grown on different sugars. we provide evidence that consumption of hmos, which are abundant in the gastrointestinal tract of nursing infants, promotes a beneficial interaction between bifidobacteria and the intestinal epithelium. consumption of free milk glycans by bifidobacteria leads to reduced expression of inflammatory genes, contributing to maintenance of the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. our study represents a major step towards a better understanding of bifidobacteria-host interactions that take place in the infant gut, which can be applied to the use of bifidobacteria as probiotics to promote gut health. moreover, the results presented herein provide support for the use of prebiotic hmos as the best growth substrate for bifidobacteria, not only by supporting their growth to high densities and contributing to niche occupation, but also by inducing protective responses in the host.
