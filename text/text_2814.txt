BACKGROUND
brain derived neurotrophic factor  is the most abundant and widely expressed neurotrophin, a family of structurally related proteins required for the development and function of the vertebrate nervous system  <cit> . in the vertebrate brain, bdnf also governs long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and morphology  <cit> . recent studies have suggested that bdnf may be involved in stress-induced adaptation in adult  <cit> . indeed, several types of injury and cell stress affect the expression of bdnf in the mammalian brain; in particular, chronic stress decreases the synthesis of hippocampal bdnf  <cit>  while acute stress induces complex alterations in the expression of bdnf, including a decrease in the hippocampus and an increase in the prefrontal cortex  <cit> .

"stress" is a biological term which refers to the consequences of the failure of a human or animal body to adequately answer to environmental stimuli. stress induction is also used to study alterations of brain functioning leading to mood disorders which are often precipitated or exacerbated by acute or chronic stressful life events  <cit> . of note, stress involves subjective feelings and experience of pleasure, pain, frustration, hunger or other states, and is therefore often difficult to define and measure  <cit> . this is particularly complicated in mammals and primates in which the emotional components may have a dominant effect. since alterations in bdnf expression were also found in response to emotions such as anxiety or fear in rodents  <cit>  and bdnf affects emotional preferences in humans  <cit> , it remains to be determined how the stress itself or the associated behavioral responses contribute in mediating these changes. in this view, it is interesting to use as an animal model of stress, a fish whose brain organization is very similar to that of higher vertebrates, but is generally considered free of emotional reactions.

stress conditions were traditionally evaluated by monitoring blood levels of cortisol, hemoglobin, and glucose  <cit> , but these descriptors may not be sufficiently reliable when chronic stresses are applied and animal welfare is concerning  <cit> . it is therefore necessary to search for further parameters, which are capable to describe, taking into account the "allostatic concept"  <cit>  biological stress and animal emotional responses. this point is particularly important when monitoring welfare of animals reared for commercial interest. in fact, production and quality have to be equally improved with benefits on the public perception of the products and consequent positive repercussions on marketing aspects. accordingly, we started a search of alternative molecular biomarkers of stress. besides the classical stress-related genes such as metallothioneins , heat shock proteins , 3-hydroxil-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzymes a reductase   <cit> , enolase, na+/h+ exchanger - <dig> c-fos, glucocorticoid receptor , glucose transporter   <cit> , plus genes related to specific stress conditions, as oxygen fluctuation  and food deprivation  <cit> , we decided to consider also neurobiological markers such as bdnf.

accordingly, we investigated the effects of acute stress on bdnf expression in dicentrarchus labrax. we report the genomic organization of d. labrax bdnf and its transcripts-specific expression pattern during post-hatching development. in addition, we analyzed bdnf expression in adult tissues, and post-translational processing in response to a well standardized type of acute stress such as water deprivation.

5' genome walking
to clone 5' flanking sequence of the gene, genome walking was carried out with the genomewalker universal kit  according to the manufacturer's procedure. briefly, aliquots of genomic dna  were separately digested overnight with the following blunt-end restriction endonucleases: drai, ecorv, pvuii and stui. after inactivation, the four digested dna preparations were ligated to the genomicwalker adaptors. two rounds of pcr were performed with the bd advantage  <dig> pcr kit . adaptor-ligated dna fragments were used as template for primary pcr amplification, with the outer adaptor primer  and a gene specific 5'-outer primer . reactions were run using  <dig>  μm solution of specific primers,  <dig> μl of template,  <dig> μl of 50× advantage  <dig> polymerase mix,  <dig> μl 10× advantage  <dig> pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm dntps mix. the amplification protocol consisted of two-step cycle parameters:  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> s and 67°c for  <dig> min plus a final extension at 67°c for  <dig> min. aliquots  of 50-fold diluted primary pcr products were used as template in the secondary pcr amplification, with the nested adaptor primer  and a nested gene-specific primer  with the same reactions mix described above. the amplification protocol consisted of two-step cycle parameters:  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> s and 67°c for  <dig> min plus a final extension at 67°c for  <dig> min. amplified products were analyzed in 1% agarose gel and sequenced as above reported.

endonucleases digestion
the  <dig> kb pcr product obtained with the primers int1a/1c_fwnew and int1a/1c_rev_ <dig> was very tricky in cloning and sequencing steps because of the presence of highly repeated region. for these reasons a blunt digestion, with  <dig> u of haeiii/ <dig> μg of pcr product, was performed in order to obtain smaller fragments. the reaction was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. the four bands obtained from the digestion, of  <dig>  kb,  <dig> kb,  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb respectively, were gel purified, a-tailed with dna polymerase, ligated into pgem-t easy vector , and sequenced.

rna extraction, mrna retro transcription and amplification
total rna was extracted with trizol reagent  from about  <dig> mg of each pool of larvae and tissue following the manufacture's instruction, then treated with dnase . the first strand cdna was synthesized using  <dig> μg of total rna,  <dig> pmol random primers  and dt <dig> primer ,  <dig> μl dntps mix  <dig> mm, in a volume of  <dig> μl. the mix was heated at 65°c for  <dig> min, chilled on ice and then  <dig> μl 5× retrotranscription buffer,  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m dtt,  <dig> μl rnaseout and  <dig> u m-mlv retrotranscriptase  were added to a final volume of  <dig> μl. after incubation at 37°c for  <dig> min, the reaction was stopped at 75°c for  <dig> min. the generated cdna was stored at -20°c.

the open reading frame was obtained by rt-pcr performed with specific primers dl_bdnf_up and dl_bdnf_down designed within conserved regions of bdnf coding sequence belonging to other species. the bipartite bdnf transcripts were evaluated, when necessary, by two rounds of pcr with primers deduced on the obtained exon sequences. reactions were run using  <dig> μm solution of specific primers ,  <dig> μl of cdna,  <dig>  u of gotaq dna polymease ,  <dig> μl 5× green gotaq reaction buffer,  <dig>  mm dntps mix. the first round pcr was performed with the following conditions: 94°c for  <dig> min and  <dig> cycles at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 56°c for  <dig> s, elongation at 72°c for  <dig> s and final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. the second round pcr was performed on  <dig> μl of first round pcr product for  <dig> cycles at the same conditions.

the pcr products were loaded into 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and run in tae 1× buffer at  <dig> mv for  <dig> min; β-actin and gapdh were used as housekeeping genes. for each sample a set of pcr has been run without retrotranscription to exclude any genomic contamination.

5' and 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends 
the 5'-race was performed according to the method published by semple-rowland et al.,  <cit>  with slight modifications. briefly,  <dig> mg poly-a+ rna, extracted from seabass brain, was reversed transcribed using  <dig> u m-mlv reverse transcriptase  following the manufactured instruction and using  <dig> pmol of sequence-specific antisense primer race_bdnf_gsp <dig>  the reaction was incubated at 42°c for  <dig> min and stopped placing the tube on ice; excess primers, dntps and buffer were removed using a qiaquick pcr purification kit . in the final step of the procedure the dna was eluted in  <dig> ml of water. a poly dctp tail was added to the single-stranded cdna present using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase . the mixture was denaturated at 94°c for  <dig> min, chilled on ice, incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min and stopped at 70°c for  <dig> min; excess of dctp and buffer was removed as reported above. second strand cdna synthesis was carried out using  <dig> u taqpolymerase ,  <dig>  μm of a poly d anchor primer ,  <dig> mm dntps mix and 10× pcr buffer. the reaction was incubated in a thermocycler at the following conditions: 40°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min, than the temperature was increased at 80°c. at this point  <dig>  mm of the nested sequence-specific primer race_bdnf_gsp <dig> and a nested anchor primer race_auap were added for the amplification at the following conditions: 94°c for  <dig> min, 54°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min , last extension time 72°c for  <dig> min; kept at 4°c.  <dig> ml of a 1: <dig> dilution of the pcr products is re-amplified using the nested anchor primer race_auap and the nested sequence-specific primer race_bdnf_gsp <dig>  the pcr cycle parameters were as follow:  <dig> touchdown cycles with annealing temperature from  <dig> to 54°c, than 94°c for  <dig> min, 54°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig> min , last extension time 72°c for  <dig> min; kept at 4°c. the resulting products were run on a 1% agarose gel, purified, cloned into pgem-t easy vector  and sequenced.

the 3' race was performed with the following protocol:  <dig> μg of total rna and  <dig> pmol of adapter primer  in a volume of  <dig> μl was incubated at 70°c for  <dig> min. the mix was chilled on ice and then  <dig> μl of 5× reverse transcription buffer,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> solution,  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm dntps mix and  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m dtt were added. the mix was incubated at 42°c for  <dig> min and then  <dig> u of superscript iii reverse transcriptase  were added. after incubation at 42°c for  <dig> min, the reaction was stopped at 70°c for  <dig> min. the generated cdna  was used as template for pcr. the reactions were run using  <dig> μm solution of universal amplification primer  and gene specific 3'-outer primer ,  <dig>  u of gotaq dna polymease ,  <dig> μl 5× green gotaq reaction buffer,  <dig>  mm dntps mix. the reaction was incubated in a thermocycler at the following conditions: 95°c for 2' and  <dig> cycles at 95°c for  <dig> s, annealing depending on the melting temperature of the primers for  <dig> min, elongation at 72°c for  <dig> min and final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. a second round pcr was performed at the same conditions using  <dig> μl of first pcr product,  <dig> μm solution of uap and a nested gene-specific primer . the resulting products were run on a 1% agarose gel, purified, cloned into pgem-t easy vector  and sequenced.

semiquantitative analysis
the bipartite bdnf transcripts expression, in control and stressed brain samples, were evaluated by semiquantitative pcr. the reactions were performed with the same specific primers and conditions of qualitative pcr, and normalization was carried out using cytoplasmatic β-actin . the pcr products were loaded into 1% agarose gel and run in tae 1× buffer at  <dig> mv for  <dig> min. the semiquantitative analysis was carefully performed by bio-rad gel doc  <dig> connected to the software quantity one™ that allowed to determine, in arbitrary units, the fluorescence value of the area of each considered band. after having obtained all the values, we have normalized them with those of β-actin; than we evaluated the ratio of the "stressed" samples compared to the control ones. in this way, we have avoided differences due to template concentration in the pcr tube. the data were statistically compared using the two tail omoschedastic student's t-test. the significance level was set at p <  <dig> .

bioinformatic analysis
bdnf gene exon-intron boundaries were determined by blast, clustalw analysis http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/clustalw2/index.html and by direct comparison of pcr-amplified sequences with genomic pufferfish http://www.fugu-sg.org/blast/export.htm, zebrafish, human and rodent dna from the ncbi database .

western-blot analysis
brain and liver were extracted from control  or stressed animals  and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. the tissues were mechanically homogenized at 4°c using an extraction buffer solution containing  <dig> mm tris hcl ph  <dig> , edta  <dig> mm, spermidin  <dig> mm, pmsf  <dig> mm, iaa  <dig> mm, soy bean trypsin inhibitor ,  <dig> μg/ml turkey egg white inhibitor . after homogenization  <dig> %triton x- <dig> was added and samples were incubated in agitation for  <dig> hour at 4°c. samples were centrifuged for  <dig> min, at 4°c  and the soluble fraction  of the lysate was collected for western blot analysis. total protein content in lysate tissue samples was determined using bradford assay . samples  were run in 15% sds-page and proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane  using transfer buffer solution . subsequently, the membrane was stained using ponceau dye  to check for the complete protein transfer. membranes were cut at the level of  <dig> kda according to protein markers. the two membranes were incubated for  <dig> hour at room temperature in blocking solution  non fat milk powder,  <dig> % tween- <dig> in phosphate buffer saline solution). the upper part of the membrane  was incubated over night  at 4°c with anti-α-tubulin antibody . the lower part of the membrane  was incubated with anti-bdnf antibody . the anti-bdnf antibody recognizes the first  <dig> n-terminal aminoacids of mature bdnf and therefore is able to detect both the mature and the precursor form of bdnf. moreover, as the human and seabass mature bdnf are highly homolog  we have used human bdnf as positive control  <cit> . after o/n hybridization with the specific antibody, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for  <dig> hour at room temperature, we used goat anti-mouse hrp  for α-tubulin, and goat anti rabbit hrp  for bdnf. finally, membranes were washed with blocking solution and immunoreactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescence system .

densitometry and statistical analysis
densitometric analysis of immunoreactive bands was obtained by scanning films at 16-bit level and applying quantity one software procedures . data were normalized using as internal control the western blot for the housekeeping gene α-tubulin. the ratio probdnf vs total-bdnf or matbdnf vs total-bdnf was expressed as % and obtained with the formula: probdnf/× <dig>  each set of data was statistically analyzed using student's t-test and one-way anova . the statistical analysis was performed using sigmastat  <dig>  software. a p value of  <dig>  was set as the minimal level for statistical significance.

calculation of test performance
we considered positive to the probdnf/totalbdnf test, individuals whose score was >1sd with respect to the average value in the normal, non-stressed population. stressed animals positive to test are true positive , non-stressed animals which tested positive are false positive , stressed animals that tested negative are false negative  while non-stressed animals that tested negative are true negatives . the sensitivity, calculated as a/, measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such; and the specificity, calculated as d/, measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified. the positive predictive value is the probability that a test positive is a true positive: a/ and it is the most important measure of a diagnostic method as it reflects the probability that a positive test reflects the underlying condition being tested for. its value does however depend on the prevalence of the disease, which may vary. the negative predictive value is the probability that a test negative is a true negative: d/. the negative predictive value is the proportion of individuals with negative test results who are correctly identified.

RESULTS
genomic organization of bdnf
as the gene encoding bdnf in dicentrarchus labrax  was not described before, we first cloned the entire gene and determined its genomic organization. we used a strategy of cloning each exon separately using pcr primers designed on a consensus sequence inferred from the ortologue sequences of bdnf in danio rerio , and fugu rubripes . zebrafish, pufferfish, and seabass are all teleosts and therefore we expected a similar exon/intron organization of their bdnf gene and closely related sequences. to clone the 5' flanking sequence of the d. labrax bdnf gene, we carried out a genome walking. finally, to determine the d. labrax bdnf gene exon/intron boundaries and identify the mrnas transcribed from the gene, we performed a combination of 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cdna ends , rt-pcr and bioinformatic analysis.

the gene spans about  <dig> kb and it is organized in  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns as reported in fig. 1a . exons were identified by clustalw analysis  as the most highly conserved segments and were all found to be flanked by the typical consensus splice donor  site in eukaryotes. the exons length and position, and their exon/intron junctions are summarized in table  <dig>  in analogy with zebrafish and pufferfish, also in d. labrax the bdnf coding sequence is contained in the exon  <dig> and this tract resulted highly conserved with respect to other vertebrate species . upstream to the coding exon we have found other five untranslated exons: 1β, 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d. by aligning these exon sequences with those of the corresponding zebrafish exons, we found an identity of 85%, 43%; 82%; 74% and 82%, respectively. d. labrax bdnf transcripts analysis indicated that upstream untranslated exons can be spliced independently to the major coding exon to form distinct bipartite bdnf transcripts with different 5' utr lengths and a common coding region . interestingly, in the exons 1d, 1b and 1β we have identified in-frame atg codons that could be used as translation start sites leading to the prepro-bdnf proteins with longer n-termini .

* position numbering is based on gene sequence

the five exons located upstream to the coding region did not show any significant identity when aligned with mammalian bdnf genes  with the exception of a 75% identity between d. labrax exon 1β and mammalian exon  <dig>  and for the presence of the highly conserved segments hcs <dig>  hcs <dig> and hcs <dig>  hcs <dig> is located in d. labrax bdnf exon 1a and mammalian exon iic and showed 96% identity; hcs <dig> in d. labrax bdnf exon 1c showed 38-41% identity with a similar sequence in mouse, rat and human exon iv while the hcs <dig> is localized in the 3'utr of d. labrax, mouse, rat and human bdnf and was 97% identical  between these species .

the coding region encoded a protein precursor  with a signal peptide at the n-terminus, the propeptide of  <dig> amino acids  in the center and the mature bdnf of  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus. this organization is similar to that of zebrafish  <cit>  avian  <cit>  and mammalian bdnf  <cit> . the probdnf resulted only 87% identical to zebrafish bdnf and 74-75% to the mammalian counterparts. however, two regions were >95% identical : the first  <dig> n-terminus aa, comprising the signal peptide, and  <dig> aa just upstream of the cleavage site which also encoded for the glycosilation consensus site . analysis of the extended n-terminal sequences with the prediction programme signalp  <dig>   <cit>  showed that the n-termini produced by exons 1β and 1b have poor scores as signal peptides because of the presence of a putative signal anchor, while the very long sequence produced by exon 1d does not encode for a signal peptide.

developmental and tissue-specific expression of bdnf splice variants
to learn more about the possible role of bdnf transcripts in the seabass, we analyzed their expression during post-hatching development and their tissue distribution in the adult. the different transcripts were amplified using 5' exon forward specific primers in combination with a reverse primer located on the exon  <dig>  expression of the coding exon  <dig> was determined using internal primers. when no amplicon was detectable after the first pcr reaction, a second round of pcr was carried out to increase sensitivity. analysis of bdnf expression at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post-hatching  showed that, besides variant 1d/ <dig>  all bdnf variants were expressed during the entire larval maturation. of note, variant 1d/ <dig> transcript was undetectable at all stages even after the second round pcr. although this analysis cannot be considered quantitative, it is clear that the generated bipartite transcripts showed striking differences in their expression with 1c/ <dig> splice variant showing the highest expression throughout all post-hatching development stages .

expression of splice variants was also determined in brain, liver, kidney and muscle of adult animals. an example of the pcr analysis, after gel electrophoresis, is shown in fig.  <dig>  the highest expression levels of the d. labrax bdnf transcripts were observed in the brain even though some variants, such as 1b/ <dig> and 1c/ <dig>  were detected also in non neuronal tissues even if only after a second round of pcr. a semi-quantitative evaluation of the tissue-specific expression of d. labrax bdnf alternative transcripts is reported in table  <dig>  bioinformatic promoter analysis using transfac®  <dig>  and public version of match™ software  <cit>  highlighted two regions , upstream to the exon 1c with highly conserved consensus for the camp/calcium responsive element binding protein  which are also found in mammals upstream to the exon iv  <cit> . the presence of the hcs <dig> in fish exon 1c and mammalian exon iv supports the likelihood that these two exons are true orthologs.

* an aliquot of first pcr product was amplified in a 2nd round of pcr

n.d.: not detectable

effects of acute stress on the expression of bdnf splice variants
since acute stress induces variations in bdnf transcripts expression in the brain of rodents  <cit>  we investigated if any changes occurs when fishes underwent to a brief stressful event consisting in  <dig> minutes of controlled water deprivation condition . semi-quantitative pcr analysis of bdnf transcripts expression in the seabass brain revealed that in the stressed group there were no significant differences in the expression of coding exon  <dig>  and in the upstream exons 1β, 1a, 1b compared to the control group . in contrast, we found a significant decrease in the expression of the exons 1c and 1d . thus, acute stress in the seabass, in absence of an emotional component, induces a rapid down regulation of the exons belonging to the second exon cluster.

bdnf protein processing in seabass after acute stress
to understand if acute stress can also alter bdnf protein levels and/or processing, we analysed by western blot the liver and the brain from  <dig> normally reared controls and  <dig> animals that underwent acute stress. in both liver and brain, anti-bdnf antibodies recognized two bands with apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda which correspond to probdnf  and mature bdnf , respectively . remarkably, seabass bdnf does not contain the cleavage site  that in mammals is recognized by the membrane-bound transcription factor site- <dig> protease  to generate the pro28kda-bdnfisoforms after a cleavage at threonin  <dig>  <cit> . thus, in fishes, there is only a probdnf  and a mature bdnf.

preincubation of the anti-bdnf antibody with the corresponding immunizing peptide, abolished staining of both bands indicating that they represent the seabass bdnf . in the liver, bdnf was mostly in the mature form  nevertheless, there was also a large amount of probdnf . no statistically significant difference was observed in probdnf and matbdnf in stressed animal . similarly, in the brain, the mature form consisted in 60% of total bdnf and the probdnf in 40% of total bdnf .  <dig> min of acute stress had no effects on the total amount of bdnf in the brain but induced a highly significant increase in the probdnf levels and a corresponding significant reduction in mature bdnf . the scatter-plot distribution analysis of the two populations showed that in the brain of every animal of the stressed group, the percentage of probdnf is at least  <dig> standard deviation  above the mean value of the control group . analogous distribution, but towards lower levels, was also found for mature bdnf . we further calculated if the measurement of the percentage of probdnf on total bdnf in the brain could represent a predictive test to identify stressed animals. therefore, we calculated both sensitivity and specificity which are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test . all stressed animals had ratio of probdnf/totbdnf above  <dig> sd from the mean value of controls , hence the sensitivity of the test is 100% while the specificity is 87% due to the presence of two false positives . the test also had a positive predictive value of 88% and a negative predictive value of 100% . in sum, this test is a perfect exclusion test, which means that all specimen with probdnf/totbdnf values below 43% are certainly not stressed. thus, the brain probdnf/totbdnf ratio  owing to its remarkable difference between stressed and non-stressed animals represents a highly reliable neurological biomarker capable to detect biological stress in seabass.

discussion
this study concerns the first characterization of the bdnf gene in dicentrarchus labrax and its transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation following acute stress. we found that in the seabass, bdnf is highly expressed in the brain and that the transcripts 1c and 1d from the second promoters cluster are down regulated after acute stress. in addition, we show that acute stress induces a significant increase in the probdnf levels and a corresponding reduction in mature bdnf suggesting altered regulation of probdnf proteolytic processing. finally we show that the probdnf/totbdnf ratio  is a highly reliable novel quantitative neurological biomarker capable to detect biological stress in fishes with sensitivity 100%, specificity 87%, positive predictive value of 88% and negative predictive value of 100%.

all known vertebrate bdnf genes share a similar multiple exons organization and encode for a pre-pro-protein that is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum and proteolitically processed to yield the mature protein  <cit> . the d. labrax bdnf gene consists of at least five alternative 5'-exons and one 3'-coding exon. for what concern the nomenclature, we have referred to previous studies on zebrafish  <cit>  because mammalian, avian and amphibians bdnf follow a different nomenclature  <cit> . analysis of d. labrax bdnf transcripts, carried out both in the early developmental stages and in adult tissues, shows that all alternative upstream exons  are spliced to the protein-coding exon  <dig>  this indicates that d. labrax bdnf transcripts structure is similar to other vertebrates. in fact, multiple transcriptional initiation sites and splicing into two-part transcripts can also be found in humans, chimpanzees, dogs, pigs, cats, cows, chicken, frogs, lampreys, zebrafish, and pufferfish  <cit> .

with the exception of the exon 1a , we found strong sequence homology with zebrafish and pufferfish genes for most exons. furthermore, exon 1β contains  <dig> nt segment that is highly similar to human exon  <dig> . three highly conserved segments were found in the seabass bdnf, hcs <dig> in exon 1a which is present also in exon iic of mammalian bdnf; hcs <dig> in exon 1c also found in mammalian exon iv while in the 3'utr encoded by exon  <dig>  we have found the hcs <dig> which is also present in the 3'utr in mammals. these results suggest that mammalian exons i, ii, and iv  evolved early in the vertebrate radiation and may play a major role in bdnf action, while more recently evolved splice variants including other 5'exons may participate in more specialized functions of bdnf such as, for example, synaptic plasticity. further research in this direction may allow to test this hypothesis.

the post-hatching developmental analysis indicates that although in different amounts, all d. labrax bdnf transcripts, except 1d/ <dig>  are well represented at all stages analyzed . on the other hand, the distribution of various bdnf transcripts in adult seabass is tissue specific with all transcripts being most expressed in the brain. the splice form 1c/ <dig> was also expressed, even though at low levels, in all the examined extra nervous tissues , while exon 1b/ <dig> transcript was found only in the kidney. organ-specific expression also holds for most bdnf exons in zebrafish and mammals suggesting conserved transcriptional regulation among the vertebrates  <cit> .

according to this view, our bioinformatic analysis of d. labrax bdnf gene suggests that the region upstream to exon 1c contains two potential responsive elements, belonging to the cre family. these elements function as responsive elements also in bdnf exon iv of rat cortical neurons  <cit>  and may be responsible of the higher expression of the isoform 1c/ <dig> in adult seabass tissue. of note, a previous study on transcriptional analysis of zebrafish hcs <dig> reported that this highly conserved sequence in the 5' exon 1c  has properties of a dehancer and, depending on the sequence context, as an enhancer  <cit> .

in the second part of our study we have examined the expression of bdnf transcripts after acute stress caused by water deprivation for  <dig> minutes. although no significant difference was found in the total bdnf mrna levels between stressed and control groups , we found a significant decrease in exons 1c and 1d. this finding is consistent with data in rodents in which single immobilization stress induces down regulation of exon iv, omologous to fish exons 1c , due to decreased histone acetylation at this promoter immediately after acute stress  <cit> . of note, in a recent study we showed that exons of the second promoter clusters , are particularly important for cell survival in response to cellular excytotoxic stress in human neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . thus, activation of promoters upstream to these exons might related to a rapid adaptative response to various types of stress.

western blot analysis showed that in brain, but not in liver, probdnf content is significantly increased in the stressed samples. mammalian bdnf transcripts produce the well-known  <dig> kda propeptide precursor that is cleaved either to pro28kda or to the mature  <dig> kda bdnf forms by two different proteases  <cit> . pro28kda bdnf peptide is not further processed into the mature  <dig> kda bdnf form but it represents a true final proteolytic product generated by a specific ca2+-dependent serine proteinase known as membrane-bound transcription factor site- <dig> protease , also known as subtilisin/kexin-isozyme  <dig>   <cit> , while mature  <dig> kda bdnf is generated intracellularly by furin  <cit> , or extracellularly by plasmin and matrixmetalloprotease- <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, in the seabass we only found two bdnf forms, a probdnf form corresponding to mammalian pro32kda precursor and a mature bdnf, while the pro28kda peptide was absent. comparison of d. labrax bdnf protein with that of rodents and human bdnf, revealed that the mammalian ski- <dig> cleavage site at threonine  <dig>  is absent in fishes and amphibians and has first emerged in reptilians during vertebrates evolution  <cit> . limited proteolysis of one inactive precursor to produce active peptides and proteins is a general mechanism to generate biologically diverse products from a single gene. here, we provide the first evidence that fishes possess a simplified proteolytic regulation of bdnf and that the pro28kda proteolytic product, whose function remains yet to be determined, is absent at this stage of vertebrates evolution.

we found that acute stress profoundly alters the relative amount of probdnf and mature bdnf. our data are suggestive of a lower proteolytic activity to generate mature bdnf and thus, the uncleaved product is accumulated in the seabass brain, but not in liver, immediately after an acute stress. although, the mechanisms by which stress can prevent efficient conversion of probdnf into mature bdnf are presently unknown, several recent studies have pointed out that pro32kda bdnf has a biological function distinct from that of mature bdnf. both probdnf precursor and mature bdnf can be released from neurons  <cit> . while probdnf binds only to p <dig> receptor, mature bdnf displays high affinity to trkb and lower affinity to p <dig>  <cit> . binding of probdnf to p <dig> promotes cell death and attenuates synaptic transmission by inducing long term depression  <cit> , while mature bdnf sustains long term potentiation and cell survival  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that the shift towards higher probdnf and lower bdnf level observed after acute stress may have the biological role of attenuating pro-active behavior inducing reduced activity in stressed animals. stress affects the hormonal response in fish in much the same way it does in higher animals. stress stimulates the hypothalamus, one of the oldest parts of the brain  and is responsible for controlling the most basic functions such as hunger, thirst, sex drive and, in mammals, body temperature; all functions that are mediated also by bdnf. a reduced behavioral activity may thus represent an adaptive response to dangerous situations represented here by shallow waters, to allow for an immediate energy saving and recovery in preparation for future actions. in this context, it is striking that 100% of animals in our experimental stress group showed >1sd increase in probdnf levels . a theoretical, optimal prediction test can achieve 100% sensitivity  and 100% specificity . thus, our test performances will make it feasible to screen for stress even in low prevalence populations, particularly where samples are first pooled before testing.

in conclusion, we have determined the structure of dicentrarchus labrax bdnf gene, its expression in neuronal and non neuronal tissues, and we have demonstrated that the probdnf/totbdnf ratio  is a novel quantitative neurological biomarker capable to detect biological stress in fishes with sensitivity 100%, specificity 87%, positive predictive value of 88% and negative predictive value of 100%.

CONCLUSIONS
the high predictivity of probdnf/totbdnf ratio for stress in lower vertebrates indicates that processing of bdnf is a central mechanism in adaptation to stress and predicts that a similar regulation of pro/mature bdnf has likely been conserved throughout evolution of vertebrates from fish to man.
