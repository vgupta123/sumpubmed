BACKGROUND
the tea plant, camellia sinensis  o. kuntze, is naturally distributed in the southeast asia monsoon region and has been cultivated in china as a commercially valuable plant for at least 2000 years  <cit> . tea is made from tea plant leaves and is consumed as a popular natural non-alcoholic beverage worldwide due to its bioactive ingredients, including tea polyphenols  <cit> , theanine  <cit> , and polysaccharides  <cit> . numerous reports revealed that tea prevents cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and other oxidative stress-related diseases  <cit> . green tea, black tea or tea constituents have been shown to inhibit the development of cancer in animal models, such as lung tumorigenesis in a/j mice  <cit>  and intestinal tumorigenesis in apcmin/+ mice  <cit> . population studies suggested that green and black tea consumption could reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease  <cit> . the potent antioxidant and iron chelating actions of tea extracts were shown to attenuate the neurotoxic action of 6-hydroxydopamine -induced neuronal death  <cit> . moreover, tea also has been shown to prevent skin aging, liver cell injury and inflammation  <cit> . the benefits of tea are mainly attributed to catechins , a group of polyphenolic compounds  <cit> . as tea principal flavor substances, catechins usually account for 25% to 30% of the dry weight of fresh tea plant leaves  <cit> . the accumulation of catechins in shoots may be related to energy storage and stress resistance  <cit> .

the catechins in fresh tea leaves are usually classified into seven groups: -gallocatechin , -epigallocatechin , -epicatechin , -catechin , -epigallocatechin gallate , -gallocatechin gallate , and -epicatechingallate . the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of c. sinensis has been identified by numerous physiological, biochemical, and genetic studies  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of -egcg, -gcg, and -ecg remain unclear to date. catechins such as -egc, -ec, -gc, and -c are synthesized through the enzymatic catalysis of anthocyanidin synthase , leucoanthocyanidin reductase , and anthocyanidin reductase  in the late stage of flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> . -egcg and -ecg may be biosynthesized by a newly discovered enzyme   <cit> . the genes that encode these enzymes have been cloned or verified from c. sinensis, but information on their regulatory mechanisms remains lacking. the tea plant has a large genome  <cit> . compared to other sequenced model plants, the genome size of tea plant  is about  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  times than that of two annual herbaceous model plants, arabidopsis thaliana   <cit>  and rice   <cit> , and two perennial woody model plants, grapevine   <cit>  and black cottonwood poplar   <cit> . some genes are involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, and almost all genes may have multiple copies. only a few flavonoid biosynthetic genes in c. sinensis have been completely cloned and functionally identified. the catechins content of different tea plant cultivars are different from one another. however, the exact mechanism responsible for this difference remains unclear.

this study elucidated the mechanisms and critical genes that regulate catechins biosynthesis. transcriptomes of four tea plant cultivars from different provinces in china were sequenced using the high-throughput sequencing platform illumina hiseq™  <dig> and were de novo assembled. the tea plant samples used here included mid-leaf ‘yunnanshilixiang’  from yunnan province, small-leaf ‘chawansanhao’  from jiangsu province, high-temperature-tolerant large-leaf ‘ruchengmaoyecha’  from hunan province, and low-temperature-sensitive small-leaf ‘anjibaicha’  from zhejiang province . because of the obvious difference of geographic and climate characteristics in these four tea production areas, respectively plateau monsoon climate , coastal temperate climate , inland subtropical monsoon climate , and coastal subtropical monsoon climate , the morphology and physiology of tea plants of tea_t <dig>  tea_t <dig>  tea_t <dig>  and tea_t <dig> were different, such as leaf size and environmental adaptability. the contents and component proportions of catechins compounds are one of the important factors of the characteristics of tea-processing suitability and quality  <cit> . the tea plant cultivars of ‘yunnanshilixiang’, ‘chawansanhao’, and ‘anjibaicha’ are suitable processed into green tea, however, ‘ruchengmaoyecha’ is suitable for black tea.figure  <dig>

the same set of reference genes was established to analyze the subsequent expression abundance and the reads per kb per million reads  values of two libraries. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes were identified. function annotation analysis showed that  <dig> unigenes are involved in flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. seven genes  that encode for three key enzymes  had different expression patterns among the four tea plant cultivars, in which expression of six genes  positively associated with the concentration of their corresponding catechins. another gene lra- <dig> may not be primarily responsible for the biosynthesis of catechins, replaced by the same set of genes lra- <dig> and lra- <dig>  our study may served as a reference for further studies on the multi-gene regulation of catechins biosynthesis in c. sinensis.

differential gene expression in the tea plant libraries
the expression abundance of each sample was measured, and differentially expressed genes  were found between the two libraries. clean reads from each sample were mapped back to the above-constructed reference genes, and the mapped reads were counted to obtain rpkm values for evaluation. a total of  <dig> degs were detected among the four c. sinensis libraries, of which  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs were predicted from “tea_t1_vs_tea_t2”, “tea_t1_vs_tea_t3”, “tea_t1_vs_tea_t4”, “tea_t2_vs_tea_t3”, and “tea_t2_vs_tea_t4”, respectively, no degs were found in “tea_t3_vs_tea_t4” . overlapping genes were removed, and  <dig> degs were obtained and hierarchically clustered. the gene expression profiles are shown in a heat map . the enriched genetic annotation for degs was analyzed, and the cog, go, kegg, swissprot, trembl, nr, and nt databases were annotated to describe the functions and metabolism of the genes compared with the transcriptome database . the detailed results are given in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway based on tea plant leaf transcriptome
catechins are the main ingredient of flavonoids, which are not only important for tea quality but also related to the growth and metabolism of tea plant. the catechins pathways in the four tea plant cultivars were analyzed in this study . a total of  <dig> unigenes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were annotated and found to encode  <dig> putative enzymes from integrated function annotation . these genes potentially related to catechins biosynthesis are detailed in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

catechins contents among the four tea plant cultivars detected through rp-hplc
rp-hplc was performed to separate and detect catechins with high accuracy and sensitivity. the polyphenols extracted from the four parts of dry tea leaves were used for testing . the contents and proportions of the four components  were highly similar in three tea plant cultivars, namely, tea_t <dig>  tea_t <dig>  and tea_t <dig>  the -egc and -ec contents were always higher than the -gc and -c contents in these three tea plant cultivars. the leaves of these cultivars were similar in type and were small and medium in size. however, these detected indicators of large-leaf tea_t <dig> were completely in contrast with the rest of the cultivars . the -egc and -ec contents were obviously lower than the -gc and -c contents in tea_t <dig> .figure  <dig>

expression profiles of the genes involved in catechins biosynthesis in tea plant
rpkm values were used to analyze the expression of  <dig> unigenes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in the four tea plant cultivars to evaluate the catechins production capacity of the tea plants . the unigenes of the most and the least expression levels were taken as up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. we identified  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in tea_t <dig>   <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in tea_t <dig>   <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in tea_t <dig>  and  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in tea_t <dig>  the digital expression profiles revealed a different expression pattern in tea_t <dig> 

seven long unigene fragments that encode for three enzymes  at the stage of flavonoid biosynthesis were selected for verification through qrt-pcr analysis . the three enzymes dominated catechins production in tea plant. the results showed that the expression profiles of the seven unigenes from tea_t <dig> differed from those of the unigenes from other cultivars and those five unigenes almost exactly coincided with predictable results. moreover, six unigenes, lar- <dig>  lar- <dig>  ans- <dig>  ans- <dig>  anr- <dig>  and anr- <dig>  had strong positive correlations with corresponding catechins concentration compared with the expression profiles and the previously measured catechins contents. this result suggests that the difference in the gene expression profiles of tea_t <dig> may have caused catechins diversity.figure  <dig>

discussion
c. sinensis is a perennial cross-pollination plants that has rich genetic diversity of populations  <cit> . phenotypic diversity of c. sinensis mainly embodied in plant height, flower, leaf size and locules number. catechins are special accumulation in tea plant leaves, and their contents also have high variability in different tea plant cultivars  <cit> . multi-species transcriptome sequencing provided good tool to understand the complex transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways of different catechins components. the illumina hiseq™  <dig> sequencing platform was used because of its higher throughput, lower cost and greater output than illumina solexa genmoe analyzer  <cit> . multiple samples can also be simultaneously sequenced by barcoding . a total of  <dig>  unigenes were obtained from the tea leaf transcriptomes of the four cultivars; this number is higher than that reported from the leaves of another tea variety   <cit> . this number is between the sequencing assembly results from mixed tissues   <cit>  and from cold acclimated leaves   <cit>  of c. sinensis. the transcriptome of mixed tissues may not reach saturation by mapping it to the transcriptome of cold acclimated leaves  <cit> . in addition, leaves acclimated to cold temperatures express more genes than normal  <cit> . these findings indicated that the information of this study on c. sinensis leaves were relatively comprehensive. it is noteworthy that the data sizes of the sequences from the four samples were different. the smallest data size only had  <dig>  unigenes from tea_t <dig>  but the largest data size had  <dig>  unigenes from tea_t <dig>  therefore, each of the four copies of data independently contributed to the construction of the tea.unigene library.

a total of  <dig>   of the  <dig>  unigenes from the tea.unigene library were annotated to public databases  for comprehensive analysis. previous studies only included  <dig>  annotated unigenes from  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> ,  <dig>  annotated unigenes from  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> , and  <dig>  annotated unigenes from  <dig>  unigenes  <cit> . compared with these studies, the present study obtained more complete annotation information. the annotations in this study were compared with the go annotation from shi et al.  <cit> , and the principal difference was found between annotations from “response to stimulus of biological processes”, “membrane of cellular component”, and “nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity of molecular function”, this result indicated that the leaves were prominent at the molecular level in response to stimulation and membrane metabolism. the cog annotation was also compared with previous studies on c. sinensis  <cit> . results showed that the unigene expression profiles under “the categories of posttranslational modification”, “protein turnover”, and “chaperones” did not specifically appear in tea leaf tissue. the present results were similar to the findings of shi et al.  <cit>  rather than wu et al.  <cit> .

the abundance of gene expression is often used to explore gene expression profiles, and degs are found among different developmental stages, organizations, treatments, and species  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> degs were identified and annotated from the four tea plant cultivars. the analysis results of orthologous groups of protein from cog function classification showed that the major differences among the four tea plant cultivars were “energy production and conversion”, “posttranslational modification”, “protein turnover”, “chaperones”, “general function prediction only and secondary metabolites biosynthesis”, “transport”, and “catabolism”. however, no degs were found for “rna processing and modification”, “cell cycle control”, “cell division”, “chromosome partitioning”, “nuclear structure”, “defense mechanisms”, “extracellular structures and intracellular trafficking”, “secretion”, and “vesicular transport”. overall, the cultivars still exhibited high molecular stability.

the four tea plant cultivars  from different provinces differed in leaf size, plant morphology, and stress resistance. it is generally believed that the catechins contents were higher in large-leaf species than in small-leaf species of tea plant. however, this has not been validated at the molecular level. many genes correlate with the concentrations of catechins in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway of c. sinensis. these genes include pal  <cit> , c4h  <cit> , f3h  <cit> , and anr  <cit> . almost all genes involved in catechins biosynthesis were also found in other species  <cit> . however, the expression of a particular gene does not necessarily mean a relationship with catechins contents because of the complexity of flavonoid biosynthesis and the existence of gene isomers.

integrated functional annotation and further rpkm value analyses of the four tea plant cultivars showed that  <dig> unigenes were involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. digital expression profiles revealed that different expression profile patterns may exist in tea_t <dig>  we further confirmed the expression variations and the relationship between the gene expression and catechins biosynthesis as follows. three key enzyme genes  were selected for qrt-pcr analysis, and four types of end products  of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were selected for rp-hplc detection. ans to anr are unique for the synthetic pathway of -ec and -egc. the low expression levels of ans- <dig>  ans- <dig>  anr- <dig>  and anr- <dig> in tea_t <dig> can explain the low contents of -ec and -egc in this cultivar. lar is involved in the synthesis of -c and -gc, which significantly accumulated in tea_t <dig>  the lar gene seems to be higher expression level in tea_t <dig>  one of them, lar- <dig> actually had low expression in tea_t <dig>  these results revealed that the other two lar genes  or more may control -c and -gc generation in tea plant.

catechins are the largest group of secondary metabolites in tea and are very important for processing suitability and quality  <cit> . the -egcg content of catechins is the largest and next to this are -egc, -ecg, -ec in green tea, the -c and -gc contents of catechins are usually trace  <cit> . however, -gc is considered the most important catechin for sensory quality in black tea, -c is correlated positively and significantly with various individual quality attributes and total quality scores  <cit> . the contents and component proportions of catechins of c. sinensis mainly determined by the cultivars of tea plant and environmental conditions  <cit> . in the present study, four tea plant cultivars from different origins were selected for rp-hplc detection of catechins. the results showed that the -ec and -egc contents of catechins in ‘yunnanshilixiang’ , ‘chawansanhao’ , and ‘anjibaicha’  were higher than that in ‘ruchengmaoyecha’ ; the -c and -gc contents of catechins in tea_t <dig> were higher than that in the other three tea plant cultivars. it conformed to their processing characteristics of green tea or black tea. in addition, the relevance between three key structural genes  and the diversity of catechins components in the four tea plant cultivars was confirmed through analyzing their expression profiles. this will help to explore tea-processing suitability at the molecular level and develop better germplasm resources of tea plants based on the genetic metabolic regulation of catechins.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a global survey of transcriptomes from four c. sinensis cultivars and thus may serve as an available genetic diversity resource for the tea plant. analyses of transcriptome profiles and physiological indicators identified putative genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. results showed that the multi-gene regulation of large-leafed catechins significantly differed relative to other cultivars. the expression levels of genes ans, anr, and lar may cause differences in catechins components by comparing the expression profiles and catechins contents of the cultivars. this study provided novel insights into the mechanisms of catechins biosynthesis in tea leaves.
