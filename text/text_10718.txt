BACKGROUND
malaria is a severe global infectious disease. the world health organization estimated  <dig> million clinical cases, and  <dig>  deaths due to malaria in  <dig>  malaria infection was reported in  <dig> countries in  <dig>  representing a major public health concern. the vast majority of the deaths occurred in children under age  <dig> in sub-saharan areas; it is estimated that a child dies from malaria every minute.

the causative agents of malaria are a group of parasites from the genus plasmodium. among five human malaria parasites, plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria. it is notoriously difficult to study malaria biology as the parasite has a complex life cycle involving a mosquito vector and a human host. within a human host, the parasite has a relatively dormant liver stage and an active red blood cell  stage. clinical symptoms such as high fever, chills, headache, profuse sweats, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are manifested at the blood stage, the stage that most drugs target against.

the effectiveness of antimalarial drugs, however, has been constantly challenged during the past decades due to the fast evolution of parasites that are resistant to multiple lines of drugs. this underscores an urgent need to search for novel drug targets. new lines of antimalarial targets have been identified  <cit>  and are at various stages of functional and pharmacochemical characterization, thanks to the development of customized omic-based high throughput technologies, including genome sequencing and annotation  <cit> , microarray  <cit> , rna-seq  <cit> , mass spectrometry  <cit> , yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assays  <cit> , and large-scale compound screening  <cit> . moreover, these amassing genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics  <cit> , and interactomic data are enabling a new systems biology paradigm in malaria research; the complex and dynamic cellular processes such as pathogenesis and virulence have recently begun to be unveiled.

by nature, pathogenicity is an emergent property, that is, it is the result of the concerted effects of many genes. the suggestion by mu et al. that differences in drug resistance in p. falciparum parasites from different continents were due to "overlapping, but not identical, sets of genes, including many encoding unknown proteins"  <cit>  and the observation that the costs of maintaining antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be offset or lost thanks to changes at other loci not directly involved in antibiotic resistance  <cit>  are both strongly suggestive of the reality of systems-level adaptation and of the existence of systems producing the virulence phenotype  <cit> . however, unlike bacterial systems, whose pathogenesis mechanism is much better characterized, to date, malaria pathogenesis, i.e., the development of the disease condition, remains largely unknown. a critical barrier is our limited knowledge of the cellular components, cellular events and reactions and other pathologic mechanisms associated with the disease development.

to unveil previously unknown proteins that are potentially involved in pathogenesis in p. falciparum, we developed a module-based subnetwork alignment approach. traditional homology transfer using a protein-protein network alignment approach  <cit>  does not appear feasible to predict functional othologs in the malaria parasite, because of the remote homology between p. falciparum and other known model organisms: blast-based sequence similarity search was unable to make functional annotation for over 60% of the genes in p. falciparum  <cit> . our neighborhood subnetwork alignment algorithm  <cit>  could potentially circumvent this limitation by searching for the similarities between functional modules. this algorithm, which was custom-developed for malaria research, was used to predicted novel transcriptional regulators and cell cycle regulatory proteins in p. falciparum  <cit> . in this paper, we extended the subnetwork alignment approach to identify the proteins related to pathogenesis and explore their potential functional roles.

RESULTS
twenty-four  novel proteins were predicted to be associated with pathogenesis in malaria parasite
malaria pathogenesis is an emergent property that involves dynamic regulation of parasite metabolism, parasite signaling, and host-parasite interactions  <cit> . gene ontology using term go: <dig>  predicted  <dig> p. falciparum genes , not surprisingly, including  <dig> members of the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  family. pfemp <dig> is encoded by the highly polymorphic var gene, and is one of the largest and most widely-studied protein families in p. falciparum. pfemp <dig> is believed to play an important role in parasite pathogenesis and immune evasion  <cit> ; it contributes to antigenic variation and cytoadherence, and the expression of specific pfemp <dig> variants is associated with severe malaria in children  <cit> .

given the observed complexity of malaria pathogenesis, one might envisage that more network components have yet to be identified. using a neighborhood subnetwork alignment algorithm, we predicted that  <dig> novel proteins in p. falciparum were functional orthologs of proteins known to be involved in pathogenesis in e. coli . e. coli was chosen because its pathogenesis and virulence mechanisms are among the best-characterized of all known infectious agents. seven of these predicted functional orthologs were annotated as "conserved plasmodium proteins with unknown function", six of which do not have any predicted interactors in malarial protein-protein association networks . seventeen of these  <dig> predicted functional othologs may be involved in various biological processes from post-transcriptional regulation, protein translation, protein ubiquitination and modification, oxidation-reduction process, signaling, metabolism, to histone modification. notably, one functional ortholog  is a variant of pfemp <dig>  and it is also consistent with the go prediction that it may be associated with pathogenesis .

the set of functional orthologs is involved in important biological processes that are related to pathogenesis and virulence
we performed network mining on the  <dig> predicted pathogenesis-related functional orthologs. eighteen proteins are associated with  <dig> other proteins with high confidence score . the network centralization parameter, a measure of the distribution of network density  <cit> , is  <dig> , indicating that the network is decentralized. the degree of connectivity of these  <dig> proteins ranges from  <dig> to one and the degree distribution offers a good fit to a power law distribution . this type of distribution indicates that most nodes are connected to a few others and a few nodes are connected to many others . the network heterogeneity coefficient assesses the relative number of hubs in a network; in this network it is relatively high , which is in accord with the observed power law distribution.

 <dig>  tight associations between translation, protein turnover, proteolysis, signaling, and stress response

the predicted functional ortholog with the highest connectivity  is a putative 60s ribosomal protein l40/ubi  . this protein is unique as it is a fusion protein of two domains: a c-terminal ribosomal l40e family domain and an n-terminal ubiquitin domain. it therefore plays dual functions: on one hand, it is a central member of the ribosomal protein complex in p. falciparum, which includes small and large subunit ribosomal proteins of varying sizes. this complex is associated with several translation initiation and elongation factors. on the other hand, l40/ubi is implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome system   <cit> . ups is an essential mechanism in p. falciparum for degrading misfolded or unneeded proteins  <cit> . ups is becoming a promising target for antimalarial development due to its critical roles in cell cycle regulation and stress response and the relative low toxicity of its inhibitors  <cit> . notably, malarial l40/ubi may be involved in other processes that are currently not fully appreciated, such as  signaling. l40/ubi and pfrack  are associated with a high confidence score , suggested by the co-expression of their homologs in caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, and humans, and protein-protein interaction found by affinity capture-ms assay in humans. the evidence that pfrack could directly inhibit inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated calcium-signaling in mammalian host cells is indicative of a pathogenesis mechanism acting through the disruption of host activities  <cit> .  genome stability. l40/ubi is associated with two putative proliferating cell nuclear antigens , auxiliary factors of dna polymerase. ubiquitin, along with sumo , were shown to effectively regulate dna damage recognition and repair in yeast  <cit> . a similar mechanism, if it exists in the malaria parasite, would promote the accuracy of replication and timely repair, both of which are crucial for parasite survival within the host.

 <dig>  rna metabolism and transcriptional regulation

the predicted pathogenesis-related functional orthologs with the second largest connectivity  is a putative dead/deah box atp-dependent rna helicase  . the main function of this family of rna helicases is to unwind rna  <cit> . helicase is considered to be a potential antimalarial target due to its essentiality for parasite life cycle  <cit> . fifty-one dead/deah helicase homologs were identified in p. falciparum by genomic analysis  <cit> . our network mining indicated that pf3d7_ <dig> is broadly involved in rna metabolism; it is associated with  several rna polymerase subunits and a number of other helicases required for transcription,  nucleolar gtp-binding proteins, putative gtpases, and brix-domain containing proteins for ribosomal biogenesis and maturation,  at least three putative u <dig> snornp associated proteins for pre-rrna processing,  a ribosomal subunit export protein for rna transport, and  an eukaryotic initiation factor required for translation. in addition to rna metabolism, pf3d7_ <dig> is associated with a putative transcription factor . this transcription factor is a member of the general transcription factor tfiis family with a characteristic zinc ribbon conformation. the accurate information flow of basal transcriptional regulation and rna metabolism is essential for parasite development.

 <dig>  chromatin remodeling, epigenetic regulation, and antigenic variation

it is becoming clear that chromatin remodeling/histone modification controls genome-wide gene expression in p. falciparum and epigenetic regulation may be a neglected major contributing factor to antigenic variation and evasion of the human immune system during parasite pathogenesis  <cit> . our network analysis identified a subnetwork module centered on pfgcn <dig> , a bona fide histone acetyltransferase. pfgcn <dig> is associated with  <dig> other proteins , including histones h2a, h <dig>  and h <dig>  dna helicase, three histone deacetylases, a putative chromodomain-helicase-dna-binding protein, and a putative chromatin assembly protein asf <dig>  suggesting its role in chromatin remodeling. in addition, pfgcn <dig> may be involved in transcriptional regulation: it is associated with the transcriptional activator ada <dig> with a confidence score of  <dig>   <cit> ; in yeast, gcn <dig>  ada <dig>  and ada <dig> interact and form a catalytic core for histone acetyltransferase  activity. pfgcn may also have protein-protein interactions with a general transcription initiation factor tfiid and a putative transcriptional regulator. interestingly, pfgcn <dig> is predicted to be associated with a transcriptional regulatory protein sir2a  . sir2a and its paralog sir2b are implicated in epigenetic regulation of pfemp <dig> antigenic variation, thus controlling the pathogenicity of malaria  <cit> .

pfgcn <dig>  is also indirectly associated with three predicted pathogenesis-related functional orthologs :  an naps protein  involved in nucleosome assembly,  a putative ribosome-recycling factor  that is essential for recycling of organellar ribosomes during protein translation, and  a putative inositol polyphosphate kinase  that may be involved in signaling, chromatin remodeling, and mrna export.

unlike the pfgcn5-centered chromatin-remodeling module, very little is known about another subnetwork centered on two plasmodium exported proteins hyp <dig>  and gexp <dig>  . the function of these two proteins is unclear, and the majority of their interactors are hypothetical proteins as well; the evidence of association is mainly established based on co-expression profiles and does not necessarily suggests direct functional association.

CONCLUSIONS
using a neighborhood subnetwork alignment algorithm, we identified network components associated with  <dig> potential pathogenesis-related proteins that may be involved in malaria pathogenesis. the proteins play roles in parasite information processing, signaling, epigenetic regulation, and entry to the host, all processes that are related to pathogenesis and virulence. a better understanding of the network components containing these proteins creates a new list of potential rational targets for antimalarial intervention.
