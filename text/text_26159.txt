BACKGROUND
spl proteins constitute a diverse family of transcription factors playing vital roles in plant growth and development. spls are specific to plants and have a highly conserved sbp  domain with approximately  <dig> amino acid residues. the domain contains three functionally important motifs, including zinc finger  <dig> , zinc finger  <dig> , and nuclear location signal   <cit> . genes encoding spls were first identified for sbp <dig> and sbp <dig> in antirrhinum majus <cit> . lately, it has been found in various green plants, including single-celled green algae, mosses, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. the results showed that spls existed as a large gene family in plants. for instance, the spl gene family in arabidopsis, rice, physcomitrella patens, maize and tomato includes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> .

the  <dig> arabidopsis spls are termed as atspl <dig> to atspl <dig> <cit> , respectively, of which atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> are relatively large and expressed constitutively, while the others are relatively small and highly expressed in flowers  <cit> . ten of the  <dig> atspls, including atspl2–atspl <dig>  atspl9–atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig>  are regulated by mirnas belonging to the mir <dig> family  <cit> . atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> contain complementary sequences of mir <dig> in 3’ utr, and all of them promote vegetative phase change and flowering  <cit> . atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> regulate morphological traits of cauline leaves and flowers  <cit> . overexpression of mir156b reduces the accumulation of atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> mrna  <cit> . atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> act redundantly in controlling the juvenile-to-adult growth phase transition and leaf initiation rate in arabidopsis <cit> . six atspls, including atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig>  are not targets of mir <dig> in arabidopsis. among them, atspl <dig> can bind directly to the cu-response element  containing a core sequence of gtac and is a regulator of cu homeostasis in arabidopsis <cit> . atspl <dig> regulates pollen sac development  <cit> , male fertility  <cit> , ga biosynthesis and signaling  <cit> . atspl <dig> plays significant roles in plant development and sensitivity to fumonisin b <dig>  <cit> . among the  <dig> rice spls, half are predominantly expressed in various young organs  <cit> . osspls targeted by mir <dig> are involved in the development of flowers in rice. osspl <dig> regulated by mir <dig> also controls shoot branching in the vegetative stage  <cit> . in maize, liguleless1containing the sbp domain regulates ligule and auricle formation  <cit> .

populus trichocarpa is a model plant with whole genome sequence available  <cit> . a total of  <dig> mirna precursors, including  <dig> for mir <dig>  have been identified  <cit> . however, the regulation of mir <dig> in p. trichocarpa ptspls has not been analyzed. in our previous studies  <cit> ,  <dig> ptspls, which appeared to be full-length or partial sequence with at least  <dig> amino acids, were identified from the populus genome assembly v <dig>  . they were named ptspl1–ptspl <dig>  respectively, of which ptspl <dig> and ptspl <dig> had the highest similarities with atspl <dig> involved in cu homeostasis  <cit> . in order to characterize the whole spl gene family in p. trichocarpa, we searched the populus genome assembly v <dig> , v <dig>  and v <dig>   <cit> . it resulted in the identification of  <dig> full-length ptspls. gene structures, chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, conserved protein motifs and expression patterns of all identified ptspls were systematically analyzed. mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of ptspl genes was investigated. the results provide useful information for elucidating the biological functions of spls in p. trichocarpa.

phylogenetic analysis of spls in p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis
in order to investigate the evolutionary relationship between p. trichocarpa and a. thaliana spl proteins, a neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree was constructed for  <dig> ptspls and  <dig> atspls using mega <dig> . the reliability of branching was assessed by the bootstrap re-sampling method using  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. only nodes supported by bootstrap values >50% are used for further analysis. the results showed that the  <dig> spl proteins clustered into  <dig> groups , each of which contained at least one atspl and one ptspl . it is consistent with the results from smspls in salvia miltiorrhiza <cit> . to further confirm that there are  <dig> groups of spls, we also constructed a phylogenetic tree for  <dig> ptspls,  <dig> atspls,  <dig> rice osspls and  <dig> smspls. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> spls also clustered into  <dig> groups. the difference between the two trees constructed  is that ptspl <dig>  ptspl <dig>  ptspl <dig> and atspl <dig> belonging to g <dig> in figure  <dig> are included in g <dig> in additional file  <dig>  an intron was found in the sbp domain-encoding region of all spl genes from p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis ; however, sequence feature analysis showed that the sbp domain of spls in g <dig>  were divergent from the other groups. the n-terminal zinc finger of g <dig> spls has four cysteine residues in the sbp domain, while spls in the other groups mainly contain three cysteines and one histidine, indicating the diversification of plant spl evolution. on the other hand, spls within a group have similar intron number, exon-intron structure, and coding sequence length. consistently, the length, mw and theoretical pi of deduced spl proteins within a group are also similar, although they are divergent among groups. it suggests the conservation of plant spls in a group. phylogenetic analysis showed that ptspl <dig> and ptspl <dig> had high homology with atspl <dig>  an arabidopsis spl with the capability of binding cures in the mir <dig> promoter in vitro and involved in response to copper deficiency in arabidopsis <cit> . it is consistent with our previous results for ptspls  <cit> . based on the phylogenetic tree, ptspl <dig> and atspl <dig> are very likely to be orthologous proteins . additionally,  <dig> pairs of atspls and  <dig> pairs of ptspls seem to be paralogous proteins . it includes atspl9/ <dig>  atspl10/ <dig>  ptspl8/ <dig>  ptspl12/ <dig> and ptspl11/ <dig> belonging to g <dig>  ptspl18/ <dig> and ptspl14/ <dig> from g <dig>  ptspl21/ <dig> belonging to g <dig>  atspl14/ <dig>  atspl1/ <dig>  ptspl2/ <dig>  ptspl1/ <dig> and ptspl6/ <dig> included in g <dig>  and atspl3/ <dig>  ptspl16/ <dig> and ptspl20/ <dig> clustering in g <dig>  about  <dig> % of the  <dig> atspls and  <dig> % of the  <dig> ptspls exist as paralogous pairs. it suggested that the expansion of spl genes occurred after separation of paralogous genes. the results from paralogous pair identification were consistent with segmental duplications in the p. trichocarpa genome   <cit> , suggesting the origination of paralogous ptspls from segmental duplication. prediction of potential age of tandem duplication events using synonymous substitutions  values showed that the segmental duplication events for ptspls appeared to occur in 9– <dig> mya . it is consistent with the age of p. trichocarpa genome duplication events  <cit> .

comparative analysis of ptspl and atspl gene structures
gene structure analysis showed that the number of introns in the coding region of  <dig> ptspl genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  the number of ptspls with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> introns is five, ten, four, one, six, and two, respectively . similarly, the intron number of  <dig> atspls varies between  <dig> and  <dig> . the pattern of intron distribution in ptspls is quite similar to atspls with the majority to be  <dig> and  <dig> introns, followed by  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . in addition, the position of intron in the sbp domain is highly conserved. it locates in the codon for the 48th amino acid of sbp domain . these results suggest the conservation of exon-intron structures between ptspls and atspls.

the length of introns varies significantly among ptspl genes, such as those in g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> . we analyzed the internal exons and introns of ptspls and atspls. the results showed that the exons of ptspls had a size from  <dig> to 884 bp with an average of 314 bp, which is slightly greater than 293 bp of the average length of atspl exons. approximately 59% of ptspl exons and 63% of atspl exons have a size below 300 bp and 71% and 70% of exons are between  <dig> and 160 bp in ptspls and atspls, respectively . although the size distribution of ptspls exons is similarity with atspl exons, intron size distribution is more variable, ranging from 30 bp to  <dig>  kb. there are  <dig> ptspl introns  with sizes > <dig>  kb; however, no such introns exist in atspls. about 55% of ptspls have sizes below 300 bp and 56% of introns are between  <dig> and 160 bp; however, the majority of atspls  have sizes below 300 bp. the average size of ptspl introns is 476 bp, which is much greater than 120 bp of atspls. these results suggest the difference of exon and intron size distribution between ptspls and atspls.

identification of  <dig> conserved motifs
conserved domains of ptspls were analyzed using pfam  and by blast analysis of protein sequences against the conserved domain database . the results showed that all of the  <dig> ptspls and  <dig> atspls contained a sbp domain with about  <dig> amino acid residues in length . it is not surprising given that the sbp domain was used for ptspl identification. sequence analysis of sbp domains revealed that the conserved zinc-binding sites, zn <dig> and zn <dig>  also existed in the sbp domain of ptspls . zn <dig> is cys3his-type  in g1–g <dig> spls ; however, the his residue in zn <dig> is replaced by a cys residue in g <dig>  which results in the signature sequence of g <dig> spls to be cccc . unlike zn <dig>  the signature sequence  of zn <dig> is highly conserved in all spls analyzed. in addition to zn <dig> and zn <dig>  the sbp domain contains a conserved nuclear location signal  in the c-terminus of sbp domains . the conservation of sbp domains between ptspls and atspls indicates that the domain organization has been established in ancient plants. moreover, six ptspls  belonging to g <dig> contain an ank or ank- <dig> domain with three or four ankyrin repeats , which are involved in protein-protein interaction  <cit> . it is consistent with previous results from atspls and smspls  <cit> .

in addition to the conserved domains, other conserved motifs could also be important for the function of spls  <cit> . we searched conserved motifs using meme and applied an e-value cut off of 1e− <dig> to the recognition. it resulted in the identification of  <dig> motifs for  <dig> ptspls . the majority of motifs identified are conserved between ptspls and atspls  <cit> , while three, including motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are specific to ptspls. it indicates the conservation and diversity of ptspls and atspls. the number of motifs in each spl varies from  <dig> to  <dig> . motif  <dig> is actually the sbp domain. consistently, it exists in all spls analyzed. motif  <dig> existed in g <dig> and g <dig> spls contains the target gene sequence of mir <dig>  indicating the posttranscriptional regulation of g <dig> and g <dig> spls by mir <dig>  in addition to motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  several motifs widely exist in two spl groups, such as motif  <dig> found in g <dig> and g <dig>  motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> existing in g <dig> and g <dig> , indicating the importance of these motifs. we also found several motifs to be group-unique, such as motif  <dig> specifically existing in g <dig> spls and motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> specific to g <dig> . these group-unique motifs could be important for specific roles of spls in the group. moreover, ptspls and atspls  <cit>  within a group share similar motif, indicating they probably play similar roles in plant growth and development.

expression patterns of spls in p. trichocarpa
the expression pattern of a gene is often correlated with its function. in order to preliminarily elucidate the roles of ptspls in p. trichocarpa development, we first searched popgenie for gene expression data from microarray analysis  <cit> . except for ptspl <dig>  the expression levels of  <dig> ptspls in roots, stems, young leaves and mature leaves were obtained . next, we examined the relative expression levels of  <dig> ptspls in young leaves, mature leaves, young stems, young roots and tissues from developing secondary xylem and phloem from the 4th–6th and 12th–25th internodes of one-year-old p. trichocarpa plants using the quantitative real-time rt-pcr method . the results showed that qrt-pcr data was generally consistent with microarray data for relative expression of ptspls in roots, stems, young leaves and mature leaves . although all ptspls were expressed in at least one of the tissues examined, differential expression was observed. many putative paralogous genes, such as ptspl18/ <dig> in g <dig>  ptspl21/ <dig> in g <dig>  ptspl2/ <dig>  ptspl1/ <dig> and ptspl6/ <dig> in g <dig> and ptspl16/ <dig> belonging to g <dig>  show similar expression patterns, suggesting redundant roles of these ptspl gene pairs. however, the expression patterns of few gene pairs, including ptspl12/ <dig> in g <dig>  and ptspl14/ <dig> belonging to g <dig> are distinct. it indicates these ptspls may play different roles in p. trichocarpa development, although they are paralogous genes.

mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of ptspls
it has been shown that  <dig> atspls are regulated by mir <dig>  <cit> . the complementary sites of mir <dig> are in the coding regions or 3’ utrs of atspls. in order to know mir156-medicated posttranscriptional regulation of ptspls, we searched coding regions and 3’ utrs of all ptspls for targets of p. trichocarpa mir156a–mir156j on the psrnatarget server using default parameters  <cit> . the results showed that  <dig> ptspls were potential targets of mir <dig> . mir156-targeting sites in  <dig> ptspls belonging to g <dig> and g <dig> locate in the last exon and encode the conserved peptide alslls. the target sites for other  <dig> ptspls belonging to g <dig> locate in the 3’ utrs close to the stop codons . consistently, atpsls clustering in g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> are targets of mir <dig> in arabidopsis. it suggests that mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of spls is conserved in p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis.

discussion
spls are plant-specific transcription factors containing a highly conserved sbp  domain. it can specifically bind to the promoters of floral meristem identity gene squamosa and its orthologous genes and plays important regulatory roles in plant growth and development  <cit> . the genes encoding spls have been identified from various plant species, such as arabidopsis <cit> , maize  <cit> , antirrhinum majus <cit> , rice  <cit> , silver birch  <cit> , and s. miltiorrhiza <cit> . spl genes exist as a large gene family in plants. the number of spls in arabidopsis, rice, p. patens, maize and tomato is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . availability of the whole genome sequence allows us to perform genome-wide identification of spls in p. trichocarpa. analysis of three versions of the annotated p. trichocarpa genome showed the existence of  <dig> full-length ptspls, which distribute on  <dig> chromosomes. it is the first attempt to analyze the ptspl gene family. the results provide a basis for elucidating the functions of spls in p. trichocarpa, a model forest tree.

the number of spl genes in p. trichocarpa is much greater than that in arabidopsis, rice, p. patens and tomato, although it is similar to the number of maize spls <cit> . sequence homologous analysis suggests that gene duplication plays an important role in spl gene expansion in p. trichocarpa. a total of  <dig> pairs of intrachromosome-duplicated ptspls were identified in this study. all of them clustered together in the phylogenetic tree . it is consistent with previous findings for generation and maintenance of gene families in other organisms, such as mouse, human and arabidopsis <cit> . actually, gene duplication has been reported for many plant transcription factor gene families, such as myb, ap <dig>  mads and so on  <cit>  and duplicated spl gene pairs have been identified in arabidopsis  and rice   <cit> . however, the number of homologous ptspl gene pairs is obviously greater than that in arabidopsis and rice, indicating that more segment duplication events happened in populus and most spl genes in arabidopsis and populus expanded in a species-specific manner  <cit> .

comparative analysis of p. trichocarpa ptspls and arabidopsis atspls revealed many conserved sequence features. for instance, all of the deduced proteins contain the highly conserved sbp domain with about  <dig> amino acid residues. the intron position and intron phase in the sbp-domain-encoding regions are also conserved among all spl genes in p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis, indicating that plant spl genes originate from a common ancestor. based on the neighbor-joining  phylogenetic tree constructed using mega  <dig> .,  <dig> spl proteins from p. trichocarpa and arabidopsis were found to cluster into  <dig> groups. each group includes at least a ptspl and one atspl. the intron number and intron phase are similar for ptspls and atspls within a group. the results suggest the conservation between p. trichocarpa ptspls and arabidopsis atspls.

it has been shown that atspls play significant regulatory roles in a variety of developmental processes in arabidopsis. for instance, morphological traits of cauline leaves and flowers are regulated by atspl <dig>  atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> <cit> . juvenile-to-adult growth phase transition and leaf initiation rate are controlled by the redundant action of atspl <dig> and atspl <dig> <cit> . pollen sac development, male fertility and ga biosynthesis and signaling are regulated by atspl <dig>  a member of g <dig>  <cit> . cu homeostasis in arabidopsis is regulated by the member of group  <dig>  atspl <dig> <cit> . in this study, we found that many motifs were unique to or mainly existed in a group of spls. it is consistent with the redundant roles of atspls in a group and indicates that the members of ptspls in the same group may play similar roles as their arabidopsis counterparts. the function of spls in different groups could be functionally distinct. on the other hand, three ptspl-specific motifs, including motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were identified, suggesting that some ptspls may play species-specific roles. consistently, most of paralogous ptspl gene pairs in the same group show similar expression patterns, whereas a few of them exhibit differential patterns. the results indicate subfunctionalisation and neofunctionalisation of spls within a plant species and among different species.

mir156-medicated posttranscriptional regulation is important for the function of a subset of spls <cit> . target prediction showed that all ptspls in groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were regulated by mir <dig>  the complementary sites of mir <dig> locate in the coding region of g <dig> and g <dig> spls, whereas it locates in 3’ utr of g <dig> spls. it is consistent with the results from arabidopsis spls and suggests the conservation of mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a total of  <dig> full-length spls were identified from the whole genome sequence of p. trichocarpa. through a comprehensive analysis of gene structures, phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal locations, conserved motifs, expression patterns and mir156-mediated posttranscriptional regulation, the ptspl gene family was characterized and compared with spls in arabidopsis. the results showed that  <dig> ptspls and  <dig> atspls clustered into  <dig> groups. many ptspls and atspls within a group are highly conserved in sequence features, gene structures, motifs, expression patterns and posttranscriptional regulation, suggesting the conservation of plant spls within a group. however, significant differences were observed for spls among groups. in addition, various motifs were identified in ptspls but not in atspls. it suggests the diversity of plant spls. the results provide useful information for elucidating the functions of spls in p. trichocarpa.
