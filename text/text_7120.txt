BACKGROUND
hox genes encode a conserved family of homeodomain-containing transcription factors essential for metazoan development  <cit> . as a result of duplication events, vertebrate genomes contain four clusters of hox genes, with the exception of teleost fish that have undergone an additional genome duplication - for instance, the zebrafish genome contains seven hox clusters  <cit> . in most cases, genes that occupy the same position in different clusters  have similar expression patterns and functions, leading to redundancy of hox function. during early development, hox genes specify tissue identities along the anterior-posterior  axis of the animal. the linear arrangement of hox genes in the genomic clusters coincides with the timing and position of their expression along the ap axis, a characteristic termed colinearity  <cit> . the retinoic acid  signaling pathway activates early hox gene expression and is important in colinear regulation  <cit> . ra binds a heterodimeric complex of ra receptors  and retinoic x receptors  that target cis-regulatory sites known as ra response elements  in the hox clusters  <cit> . ra promotes decondensation of hox clusters from compact chromosomal chromatin in cells and embryos  <cit>  and this process correlates with the progressive activation of hox transcription along the genomic cluster. once transcribed, hox genes also regulate the expression of other hox genes in auto- and cross-regulatory loops. the highly conserved process of hox gene activation and regulation leads to an overlapping series of hox expression domains along the ap axis, sometimes referred to as the “hox code”  <cit> .

during early embryogenesis, the presumptive vertebrate hindbrain is transiently divided into seven to eight segments  and hox genes play a key role in formation of the more posterior rhombomeres  <cit> . each rhombomere gives rise to unique cell populations from which segment-specific motor neurons and reticulospinal neurons differentiate. for motor neurons, this includes the trigeminal neurons in rhombomere  <dig>  and r <dig>  the facial motor neurons  in r <dig>  the abducens neurons in r <dig> and r <dig>  and the vagal neurons in the caudal hindbrain. these neuronal pools form the motor neuron nuclei of the vth, vith, viith and xth cranial nerves that innervate the face, head, and neck of the animal. reticulospinal neurons also form in a rhombomere determinate manner and regulate breathing and circulation, as well as the coordination of locomotor signals between the spinal cord and the brain. for instance, the mauthner neurons  form in r <dig> and extend axons contralaterally and posteriorly and function to control the escape response. segmentation of the hindbrain starts with the formation of r <dig> followed by r1/r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  and r5/r <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, the first hox genes transcribed in the mouse, hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig>  are expressed in r <dig>  <cit> . a series of loss-of-function studies have determined that hoxa <dig> and its downstream target hoxb <dig> have separate functions. in particular, hoxa <dig> mutant mouse embryos have segmentation defects while hoxb <dig> mutants appear to have neuronal defects related to r <dig> specification. the segmentation defects observed in hoxa <dig> mutants include an enlarged r <dig>  a reduced r <dig>  and a reduced or completely lost r <dig>  <cit> . similar segmentation defects are also found in mice with mutations made to the retinoic acid response element  found in the downstream enhancer of hoxa <dig> <cit> . these segmentation defects are specific to the function of hoxa <dig>  as mouse hoxb <dig> mutant embryos show no defects in hindbrain segmentation  <cit> . while hindbrain segments form normally in hoxb <dig> mutants, r <dig> derived fmns fail to migrate into r <dig>  <cit>  and instead migrate away from the midline of r <dig>  assuming lateral positions similar to trigeminal neurons in r <dig>  fmn neurons in hoxb <dig> mutants extend axons out through r <dig> into the second pharyngeal arch similar to the projection of wild type fmn axons. loss-of-function studies for zebrafish hoxb1b and hoxb1a  have been accomplished using antisense morpholino oligos  to block translation of hoxb1b and hoxb1a. embryos injected with hoxb1bmo have hindbrain segmentation defects with an expanded r <dig> and a reduced r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  while hindbrain segmentation is unaffected in hoxb1amo-injected embryos  <cit> . furthermore, hoxb1amo-injected embryos possess fmns remaining in r <dig> that resemble the stalled fmns observed in mouse hoxb <dig> mutants. while these data indicate that the zebrafish hoxb1b and hoxb1a genes have roles similar to those of mouse hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig>  there are also differences between the defects observed in the mouse mutants versus mo-injected zebrafish. first, segmentation defects appear more severe in hoxa1−/− and hoxa1−/−;hoxb1−/− mutants than in hoxb1bmo and hoxb1bmo;hoxb1amo-injected zebrafish embryos. specifically, the r <dig> domain in hoxa1−/− mouse embryos is lost, while r <dig> is merely reduced in zebrafish hoxb1bmo-injected embryos. hoxa1−/−;hoxb1−/− mice also appear to have a stronger segmentation defect, with loss of both r <dig> and r <dig>  while hoxb1bmo;hoxb1amo-injected zebrafish embryos show only a 50% reduction in the size of r <dig>  second, unlike the hoxa1−/− mice, hoxb1bmo-injected embryos have a reduced r <dig>  third, the hoxb1amo shows no effect on the reticulospinal neurons in r <dig> although hoxb <dig> mutant mice have a miss-specified r <dig>  indeed, even when hoxb1bmo and hoxb1amo are co-injected, only incomplete formation of mauthner neurons is observed in r <dig>  these phenotypic differences suggest that either these genes function differently in mouse and zebrafish, or the mo phenotypes do not recapitulate true loss-of-function of hoxb1b and hoxb1a. here we report the generation of hoxb1a and hoxb1b germ line mutations using zinc finger and tale nucleases in zebrafish. we find that these germ line mutants have more severe phenotypes than those reported from antisense mo injections, suggesting that the mos do not completely block hox function. our results demonstrate that hoxb1a is required for specification of r <dig> and for the formation of r4-specific neurons. this is similar to the reported mouse phenotype, suggesting that hoxb1a and hoxb <dig> share conserved functions in r <dig> formation. similarly, our results reveal that zebrafish hoxb1b and mouse hoxa <dig> share functions in the formation of r <dig> and r <dig>  but their roles also differ, such that hoxa <dig> is required in mouse r <dig> while hoxb1b is required in zebrafish r <dig>  lastly, we demonstrate that hoxb1b and retinoic acid act separately to activate hoxb1a expression, with hoxb1b modulating nucleosome organization at the hoxb1a promoter.

RESULTS
generation of hoxb1a and hoxb1b germ line mutants
to investigate the roles of hoxb1a and hoxb1b in zebrafish hindbrain development, we generated hoxb1a and hoxb1b loss of function mutants using zinc finger nucleases  and tale nucleases . zfns and talens consist of the fok <dig> endonuclease tethered to sequence-specific dna-binding domains  that target the nuclease to a desired genomic location  <cit> . the use of obligate heterodimeric foki nucleases increases target specificity by requiring that two complementary foki nuclease domains bind to adjacent genomic sequences for activity  <cit> , thereby reducing, but not eliminating, the likelihood of off-target effects. once activated through dimerization, the fok <dig> nuclease introduces a double strand dna break that is repaired through the non-homologous end joining  repair pathway. nhej is error prone and will introduce mutations at a low rate. while many of the resulting mutations do not affect protein function, we were particularly interested in identifying the small number of mutations that lead to shifts in the reading frame and introduce stop codons.

we initially employed zfns to target both hoxb1a and hoxb1b based on several criteria. first, nucleases were targeted to a site in the first exon of each gene in order to increase the likelihood that a frame shift would terminate translation upstream of known functional domains, particularly the homeodomain. second, the spacing between the target sequences for each zfn pair was set to either 5 bp or 6 bp based on previous reports indicating that these represent optimal spacing  <cit> . third, we targeted regions containing a restriction site that could be used to screen for mutations. based on these criteria, we designed several zfns to each gene using three separate zfn “builds” . the first and second builds were based on a modular library of single zinc finger proteins  <cit>  . for build  <dig>  we generated one zfn targeting hoxb1a  and one targeting hoxb1b  where each zfn contained three zinc fingers  assembled from the modular library. build  <dig>  employed the same modular library and targeted the same genomic sites as build  <dig>  but each fusion protein contained four zfs to increase specificity for the target sequence while decreasing the instances of off-target effects. for build  <dig>  we designed two zfns to each gene . zb1b- <dig> and zb1b- <dig> targeted the same genomic sequence as zb1b- <dig> and zb1b- <dig>  although zb1b- <dig> was offset 3 bp relative to zb1b- <dig>  while zb1a- <dig> and zb1a- <dig> targeted sites 60 bp and 125 bp, respectively, upstream of the site targeted by zb1a- <dig> and zb1a- <dig>  the zfns designed in build  <dig> also used four zfs each, but were assembled from an updated version of the zf library that includes two-finger modules  <cit> . these two-finger modules were optimized for their ability to bind dna efficiently in tandem to minimize the impact of context-dependent effects on recognition when fingers are assembled into arrays.

in vitro transcribed mrna encoding each zfn pair was injected into early one-cell stage embryos and genomic dna was prepared from pools of whole embryos collected 24 hours post fertilization . zfn activity was measured by amplifying the targeted region, followed by digestion to estimate the fraction of genome with a disruption of the diagnostic restriction site. notably, the zfns are likely to act after the first several cell divisions  and it is therefore expected that mutations will be induced in only a subset of cells – rendering the embryos mosaic. embryos injected with zb1b- <dig> and zb1b- <dig>  but not zb1b- <dig> or zb1b- <dig>  revealed a partial loss of the diagnostic restriction site, suggesting that these zfns are active. based on the intensity of the uncut band in the diagnostic digest, the zb1b- <dig> zfn may be more active than zb1b- <dig>  since zfns from all three builds failed to induce mutations at the hoxb1a locus, we turned to talens as an alternative method to disrupt the hoxb1a gene. to increase the likelihood of success, we generated three different hoxb1a talens that differ slightly in the length of their target sequences  using golden gate talen assembly  <cit> . as with zfns, talens were designed to target regions in the first exon of hoxb1a that include a diagnostic restriction site. notably, the talens were directed to sites 450 bp  or 430 bp  upstream from the region targeted by hoxb1a zfns. using the same mrna microinjection strategy as for the zfns, we found that talen tb1a- <dig> introduced mutations – as evidenced by loss of the diagnostic restriction site – but that tb1a- <dig> and tb1a- <dig> did not .

having identified functional zfns and talens, we raised injected embryos to establish an adult f <dig> founder population. as noted, fish in this f <dig> population will be mosaic and each individual fish may carry more than one mutant allele for the same gene . genotyping of pooled offspring identified  <dig> hoxb1a  and  <dig> hoxb1b  f <dig> founders that transmit mutations via their germ lines, suggesting mutagenesis rates of 83% and 43% for hoxb1a and hoxb1b, respectively. sequencing of mutant alleles from each f <dig> founder revealed that two of the  <dig> hoxb1a  and three of the  <dig> hoxb1b  f <dig> founders carry mutations that introduce frame shifts , while the remaining f <dig> founders transmitted mutations that disrupt the diagnostic restriction site, but that do not create frame shifts . the five f <dig> fish that carry mutations causing frame shifts were outcrossed to wild type fish and the resulting offspring raised to generate the f <dig> generation. genotyping of f <dig> fish allowed us to determine the transmission rate of mutations from mosaic f <dig> fish. we find that the hoxb1b f <dig> founders transmit their mutations at a frequency of ~40% , while the hoxb1a f <dig> fish transmit their mutations at ~10% . notably, we also find that the three hoxb1b founders each transmitted only one mutant allele, while the two hoxb1a founders transmitted multiple mutant alleles each . thus, we have generated six hoxb1a  and three hoxb1b  mutant lines  that were used for further phenotypic analysis.

closer analysis of the mutant sequences revealed that zb1b- <dig> and tb1a- <dig> generated both insertions and deletions . in particular, the zb1b- <dig> zfn introduced deletions ranging from 1 bp to 8 bp, as well as a 19 bp insertion in the hoxb1b gene, while the tb1a- <dig> talen introduced deletions ranging from 1 bp to 8 bp, as well as a 17 bp insertion, in the hoxb1a gene. we note that large insertions and deletions that interfere with the pcr reaction  would not be detected by our experiments, suggesting that the sizes observed here may be somewhat biased to smaller deletions and insertions. conceptual translation of each mutant allele confirmed a shift in the reading frame . as a result, hoxb1a mutant alleles go out of frame starting with residue  <dig> , residue  <dig>  or residue  <dig>  and hoxb1b mutants starting with residue  <dig> , residue  <dig>  or residue  <dig> . while the out of frame sequences code for varying numbers of missense residues, all terminate in a premature stop codon and none of the mutant alleles is predicted to encode a homeodomain.

lastly, we raised embryos from hoxb1a+/um <dig> x hoxb1a+/um <dig> and hoxb1b+/um <dig> x hoxb1b+/um <dig> crosses to adulthood and genotyped them. we find that hoxb1aum191/um <dig> animals do not survive to adulthood , while hoxb1bum197/um <dig> embryos do – although their viability may be somewhat reduced . we note that this is in contrast to the situation in the mouse, where both hoxa1−/− and hoxb1−/− pups die shortly after birth  <cit> .

hoxb1b is required for zebrafish hindbrain segmentation
formation of the vertebrate hindbrain requires segmentation of the neural tube into rhombomere domains, as well as the specification of distinct cell fates and the differentiation of characteristic types of neurons in each rhombomere. paralog group  <dig>  hox genes, such as hoxb1a and hoxb1b, are among the earliest genes expressed in the hindbrain primordium and hox function has been implicated in multiple aspects of hindbrain development . we therefore made use of the hoxb1a and hoxb1b mutant lines to examine the role of these genes in development of the zebrafish hindbrain.

we first examined the expression of several rhombomere-restricted genes – pax <dig> , krox <dig> , hoxb1a , hoxb3a  and hoxd4a . for this purpose, heterozygous hoxb1b+/um <dig> f <dig> fish were in-crossed and the resulting embryos were assayed at 22hpf by in situ hybridization followed by genotyping. we find that homozygous hoxb1bum197/um <dig> mutant embryos express krox <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig>  as well as hoxb1a in r <dig> . however, the size of r <dig> is increased and the size of r <dig> is decreased in hoxb1b mutants relative to wild type  embryos . to address the possibility that the zb1b- <dig> zfn might have introduced off-target mutations in the hoxb1bum <dig> line that could contribute to this phenotype, we also examined in-crosses of the hoxb1bum <dig> and hoxb1bum <dig> lines, as well as pair-wise inter-crosses among all three lines. we find that mutant embryos derived from all such crosses exhibit the same phenotype and that this phenotype segregates with the hoxb1b mutation , suggesting that it is due to disruption of the hoxb1b gene. furthermore, the prognos on-line tool  <cit>  revealed five exonic sites in the top fifty potential off-target sites for zb1b- <dig>  but neither of these sites resides on the same chromosome as the hoxb1b gene, and they would therefore segregate independently of the hoxb1b mutation in our crosses. further analysis of hoxb1bum197/um <dig> mutant embryos revealed expression of pax <dig>  hoxb3a and hoxd4a in the expected domains . in addition to the enlargement of r <dig> and the reduction of r <dig> noted above, this analysis also revealed an apparent reduction of r <dig> – as evidenced by a smaller gap between r <dig> krox <dig> staining and r <dig> hoxd4a staining , as well as by a reduction in the size of the hoxb3a expression domain  in mutant embryos relative to wild type embryos.

we next quantified the changes in rhombomere size by direct measurements . we find that r <dig> is significantly enlarged  and r <dig> significantly reduced  in mutant embryos. notably, we cannot distinguish whether this effect is due to some cells switching from an r <dig> to an r <dig> fate, or if r <dig> cells have a growth advantage in the absence of hoxb1b function. we also find that r <dig>  and r1/r <dig>  are somewhat reduced, but r <dig> is unaffected, in hoxb1b mutants. accordingly, measuring the length of the entire hindbrain reveals it to be significantly shorter in hoxb1b mutant embryos , presumably as a result of the reduced length of several rhombomeres.

analysis of hoxb1a mutant embryos  revealed normal expression of krox <dig> in r <dig> and r <dig> of the hindbrain . furthermore, the size of the r <dig> domain is normal, but expression of hoxb1a is markedly reduced in r <dig> of hoxb1a mutants . examination of embryos derived from inter-crosses of the hoxb1aum <dig>  hoxb1aum <dig>  hoxb1aum <dig>  and hoxb1aum <dig> alleles confirmed this phenotype and suggest that it results from mutation of hoxb1a rather than from off-target mutations introduced by the tb1a- <dig> talen . accordingly, the prognos tool did not reveal any exonic sites among the top fifty potential off-target sites for the tb1a- <dig> talen. since hoxb1a regulates its own expression  <cit> , the loss of hoxb1a transcript in hoxb1a mutants may be due to the loss of hoxb1a protein, or, alternatively, to reduced stability of the mutant hoxb1a transcript. accordingly, expression of fgf <dig>  another r4-restricted gene dependent on hoxb1a for expression, is also markedly reduced in r <dig> of hoxb1a mutants at 14hpf . further analyses demonstrated normal expression of pax <dig>  hoxd4a and hoxb3a  and also revealed normal size of rhombomeres in hoxb1a mutant embryos. we conclude that hoxb1b is required for formation of appropriately sized rhombomere segments in the caudal hindbrain. in contrast, hoxb1a is essential in regulating expression of r4-restricted genes, indicating a role for hoxb1a in r <dig> specification.

hoxb1a is required for formation of r4-derived neurons
a key event in hindbrain development is the differentiation of unique complements of neurons in each rhombomere. in particular, motor neurons of the vth  cranial nerve differentiate in r <dig> and r <dig>  motor neurons of the vith  cranial nerve form in r <dig> and r <dig> and motor neurons of the xth  cranial nerve form in the caudal most region of the hindbrain. in addition, motor neurons of the viith  cranial nerve form in r <dig>  but subsequently migrate to r <dig> and r <dig> in zebrafish. in order to determine if neuronal differentiation is affected in hoxb1a and hoxb1b mutants, we analyzed cranial motor neuron formation. wild type embryos displayed the expected stereotypical arrangement of cranial motor neurons at 48hpf . notably, this includes an almost complete lack of facial motor neurons  in r <dig> as a result of these neurons having migrated caudally by this stage. in contrast, all hoxb1aum191/um <dig> mutant embryos revealed a large number of motor neurons in r <dig> and reduced numbers in r <dig> and r <dig> . we interpret this to mean that fmns fail to migrate out of r <dig> and that the residual motor neurons in r5/r <dig> primarily represent abducens neurons. fmns also remain in r <dig> of all hoxb1b mutant embryos, but the phenotype is more variable than what is observed in hoxb1a mutants. approximately half of the hoxb1b mutants reveal significant retention of fmns in r <dig> , while the other half shows more extensive fmn migration . in addition to impaired fmn migration from r <dig>  the number of fmns appears lower in hoxb1b mutants and these are less well organized, with cells being less tightly grouped in r5-r <dig> and numerous cells found located outside the main clusters.

similar to the cranial motor neurons, reticulospinal neurons also display rhombomere-specific differentiation in zebrafish. specifically, bilaterally arranged mauthner neurons form in r <dig> and project their axons across the midline down into the spinal cord at 36hpf . notably, differentiated mauthner neurons are absent in hoxb1a mutant embryos . as observed for the cranial motor neurons, hoxb1b mutants show a variable phenotype such that approximately half of the embryos retain one mauthner neuron, while the other half fails to form both mauthner neurons . we conclude that hoxb1a function is absolutely required for fmn migration and mauthner neuron formation, but that hoxb1b is only partially required for these processes.

hoxb1a and hoxb1b have separate functions in zebrafish hindbrain development
since hoxb1a and hoxb1b are both required for normal r <dig> formation, we examined their functional relationship by analyzing hoxb1a/hoxb1b double mutant embryos . using in situ hybridization, we find that double mutant embryos have hindbrain segmentation defects with an expansion of r <dig> and a reduction of r <dig> and r <dig> . these changes in rhombomere size are indistinguishable from those observed in hoxb1b mutant embryos , further demonstrating that hoxb1a does not play a role in zebrafish hindbrain segmentation. furthermore, double mutant embryos lack hoxb1a expression, while single mutants show a reduction either in the level  or domain size  of hoxb1a expression , indicating that both genes may play a role in hoxb1a transcription.

next we examined neuronal differentiation in double mutant embryos. we find that fmns form in r <dig> of double mutants, but do not migrate caudally , similar to the phenotype of hoxb1a mutants . we also note that the population of fmns is smaller in double mutants , similar to the phenotype of hoxb1b mutants . lastly, double mutants completely lack mauthner neuron formation in r <dig> , identical to the hoxb1a mutant phenotype. these findings are consistent with hoxb1b being required for the size of r <dig> , while hoxb1a is required for the migration of fmns and the differentiation of mauthner neurons. notably, the abducens neuron population in r <dig> may be slightly smaller in double mutants, consistent with r <dig> being smaller in the absence of hoxb1b, but this effect cannot be seen in hoxb1b single mutants due to the residual migrating fmns. we conclude that hoxb1a and hoxb1b have different functions in hindbrain development.

hoxb1b and retinoic acid independently activate hoxb1a expression
although the size of r <dig> is reduced in hoxb1b mutant embryos, we note that hoxb1a expression persists. the expression of hoxb1a in the absence of hoxb1b is somewhat surprising since previous work suggested that early neural expression of hoxb1a depends on a hoxb1b-regulated enhancer  <cit> . since retinoic acid  is known to activate hox gene transcription in many settings  <cit> , we next investigated whether ra signaling activates hoxb1a transcription in the absence of hoxb1b.

to this end, embryos were treated with 10um diethylaminobenzaldehyde , or with 100nm exogenous retinoic acid, from 1hpf to 19hpf . we find that, in wild type embryos, 10um deab blocks krox <dig> expression in r <dig>  though not in r <dig> , but does not affect hoxb1a expression in r <dig> . treatment of wild type embryos with ra produces a distinct phenotype such that hoxb1a expression is expanded, while krox <dig> expression is lost in r <dig> and reduced in r <dig> . these results indicate that ra supports krox <dig> expression in r <dig> while it inhibits it in r <dig>  consistent with previous reports that ra promotes posterior fates  <cit> . furthermore, while hoxb1a expression in wild type embryos is enhanced by exogenous ra, it is not lost upon treatment with 10um deab.

in hoxb1b
um197/um197
 mutants, deab treatment blocks r <dig> krox <dig> expression – similar to the effect in wild type embryos – while r <dig> size is reduced somewhat . however, while deab treatment has no effect on hoxb1a expression in wild type embryos, it blocks expression in hoxb1b mutants . in contrast, ra treatment has the same effect in hoxb1b mutants as in wild type embryos, in that krox <dig> expression is lost in r <dig> and reduced in r <dig>  while hoxb1a expression is expanded . taken together, our results reveal that hoxb1a expression is abolished upon simultaneous removal of hoxb1b and ra, but not when either factor is removed by itself, suggesting that ra and hoxb1b independently activate hoxb1a expression in zebrafish r <dig> 

hoxb1b affects nucleosome positioning at the promoter of hoxb1a
we recently found that nucleosome positioning at the promoter regions of zebrafish hox genes is a progressive process that occurs over several stages of embryogenesis independent of ra signaling  <cit> . since hoxb1b regulates hoxb1a expression, at least in part, we wanted to test if hoxb1b plays a role in nucleosome positioning at the hoxb1a promoter. we took advantage of the fact that hoxb1bum197/um <dig> mutant fish are viable and mapped nucleosomes at the hoxb1a promoter of wt and hoxb1b mutant embryos using a modified nucleosome scanning approach .

we detect three well-positioned nucleosomes at approximately 360 bp, 180 bp and 35 bp upstream of the transcription start site , as well as two less well-defined nucleosomes at 50 bp and 200 bp downstream of the tss  at 4hpf – a stage when hoxb1b protein is not yet expressed and cannot yet be detected at the hoxb1a promoter  <cit> . the nucleosome profile at 9hpf – when hoxb1b is present at the hoxb1a promoter  <cit>  – is similar to that at 4hpf, but there are some notable differences . in particular, there is reduced nucleosome density surrounding the tss from approximately position -200 bp to position +200 bp, indicating that changes in nucleosome density occur at the hoxb1a promoter at developmental time points when hoxb1b is bound at the promoter.

to determine if the change in nucleosome arrangement between 4hpf and 9hpf is driven by hoxb1b, we compared the nucleosome profile of hoxb1b mutant embryos at 9hpf to that of wild type embryos at 4hpf . if hoxb1b is solely responsible for promoting changes in nucleosome arrangement, the two profiles should be similar. indeed, the 9hpf hoxb1b mutant and 4hpf wild type profiles are more similar to each other than are the wild type 9hpf and wild type 4hpf profiles, with the exception of a region centered at approximately +120 bp downstream of the tss . this finding suggests that hoxb1b is responsible for affecting nucleosome organization at the tss and immediately upstream, but not further downstream at site  <dig>  such a scenario is consistent with the fact that hoxb1b is known to bind regulatory elements located 250-150 bp upstream of the hoxb1a tss.

accordingly, when we compare the nucleosome profile of 9hpf hoxb1b mutants to that of 9hpf wild type embryos, we find that the region around +120 bp  is relatively unaffected, again consistent with nucleosomes in this region being organized independently of hoxb1b . as expected, there remains a significant difference upstream of the tss  between 9hpf wild type and 9hpf mutant embryos, confirming that nucleosome occupancy in this region is likely dependent on hoxb1b binding. together, these data identify two regions where nucleosome organization is affected at the hoxb1a promoter. the first, ~120 bp upstream of the hoxb1a tss , near the known hoxb1b binding site appears to be directly affected by hoxb1b binding, while the second, ~120 bp downstream of the tss , appears to be independent of hoxb1b binding.

discussion
the phenotypes of mouse hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig> germ line mutants, as well as the phenotypes of anti-sense mediated knock-down of zebrafish hoxb1b and hoxb1a have been characterized  <cit> . differences between the zebrafish and mouse phenotypes suggest that these genes may play different roles in different species, or, possibly, that zebrafish phenotypes induced by anti-sense morpholinos  may not represent complete loss of function. to clarify these differences we created targeted germ line mutations for zebrafish hoxb1b and hoxb1a with zfn and talen systems, respectively. our findings indicate that hoxa <dig> and hoxb1b share roles in hindbrain segmentation and that hoxb <dig> and hoxb1a have similar roles in facial motor neuron migration. comparing the phenotypes of our germ line mutants to those of mo loss-of-function suggests that the mo phenotypes do not represent complete loss of function in all respects, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that differences in genetic backgrounds may also affect the observed differences. our experiments also reveal that hoxb1b and hoxb1a have species-specific functions. in addition, we report that hoxb1a transcription is independently regulated by both ra and hoxb1b. lastly, we demonstrate that hoxb1b mediates its effect on hoxb1a expression, at least in part, by affecting nucleosome positioning at the hoxb1a promoter.

hoxa <dig> and hoxb1b have universal as well as species-specific roles in hindbrain segmentation
comparison of the previously reported hindbrain phenotypes of mouse hoxa <dig>  and zebrafish hoxb1b  loss-of-function studies reveal several similarities. in particular, r <dig> is expanded while r <dig> and r <dig> are reduced in both species  <cit> . however, there are differences in the segmentation defects observed. in particular, the r <dig> segmentation defect in mouse hoxa1−/− mutants is more severe, with some embryos losing r <dig> entirely  <cit> , while hoxb1bmo zebrafish embryos display a reduction, but not a loss, of r <dig>  <cit> . in hoxb1bmo embryos r <dig> is also reduced, a phenotype not observed in hoxa1−/− mice. the hoxb1b germ line mutants presented here have an expanded r <dig> and a reduced r <dig>  similar to mouse hoxa <dig> mutants and hoxb1bmo embryos, indicating that hoxa <dig> and hoxb1b share universal roles in the formation of these rhombomeres. however, germ line disruption of hoxb1b produces a more severe phenotype than mo injection – e.g. mauthner neurons are affected in the germ line mutant, but not by hoxb1b mo – suggesting that the hoxb1b mo does not completely block hoxb1b function. lastly, we observe a fully formed r <dig> and a reduced r <dig> in hoxb1b germ line mutants, distinct from mouse hoxa <dig> mutants, suggesting that the loss of r <dig> in hoxa1−/− mice is species specific and that hoxb1b has a species-specific role in r <dig> of zebrafish. we note that a zebrafish hoxb1b tilling mutant was recently published  <cit> . while the effects on anteroposterior patterning were not characterized in detail for this mutant, mauthner neuron formation was affected and it appears that r <dig> may be reduced in size – consistent with the phenotype of our hoxb1b zfn alleles.

hoxb <dig> and hoxb1a are required for r <dig> specification
previous reports indicate that mouse hoxb <dig> and zebrafish hoxb1a share functions important for the migration of facial motor neurons  from r <dig> during vertebrate hindbrain development  <cit>  and we confirm this function in the hoxb1a germ line mutants reported here. however, it has not been clear if hoxb1a is absolutely required for r <dig> specification in zebrafish. in particular, r <dig> specification can be tested further in zebrafish by assaying the formation of mauthner neurons. in previous work, embryos injected with hoxb1amo were found to have normal mauthner neurons  – suggesting either that hoxb1a is not absolutely required in r <dig>  or that the mo-injections do not produce a complete null phenotype. strikingly, we find that mauthner neurons fail to form in hoxb1a germ line mutant embryos, indicating that the hoxb1amo does not completely eliminate hoxb1a activity. it is not clear what step in mauthner neuron differentiation is affected by loss of hoxb1a function, but the absence of mauthner neurons was accompanied by the appearance of smaller neurons at the equivalent position in embryos co-injected with hoxb1amo and hoxb1bmo <cit> , potentially suggesting a fate change or a failure to differentiate. since our hoxb1a germ line mutant embryos also lack expression of the r4-specific fgf <dig> gene, we conclude that hoxb1a is required for r4-specific gene expression and neuronal differentiation in zebrafish.

regulation of hoxb1a transcription by ra and hoxb1b
initiation of hoxb1/hoxb1a transcription can be mediated by hoxa1/hoxb1b binding with pbx and meis/prep cofactors at a pbx/prep/hox responsive element  located upstream of the hoxb1/hoxb1a tss  <cit> . in addition, expression of mouse hoxb <dig> depends on a ra response element  located 3’ of the gene  <cit> , but it is unclear if such an element is functional at the zebrafish hoxb1a locus  <cit> , suggesting that hoxb1a might instead be highly dependent on hoxb1b for its expression in zebrafish. while we find that the hoxb1a expression domain is smaller in hoxb1b mutants, the level of expression does not appear noticeably affected, demonstrating that hoxb1a expression can be activated independently of hoxb1b in zebrafish. treatment with deab revealed that the hoxb1a expression observed in hoxb1b mutants requires ra signaling. hence, our data suggest that hoxb1b and ra can act independently to activate hoxb1a expression and that they are the predominant factors involved in this process – since simultaneous removal of both factors abolishes hoxb1a transcription. however, it remains possible that some aspects of hoxb1a expression require cooperation of ra and hoxb1b – e.g. ra induces hoxb1a more broadly in wild type than in hoxb1b mutant embryos. since a functional rare has not been identified at the hoxb1a locus, it is not clear whether ra acts directly, or if it acts indirectly via an intermediate factor.

as discussed, hoxb1b regulates hoxb1a transcription by forming a complex with pbx and prep/meis factors at the r <dig> regulatory element upstream of the hoxb1a tss  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that nucleosome positioning around the promoters of hox genes is influenced by dna-binding factors during early embryogenesis, but that ra signaling does not appear to affect this process  <cit> . we therefore took advantage of the fact that homozygous hoxb1bum197/um <dig> mutant fish are viable to test if hoxb1b affects nucleosome organization at the hoxb1a promoter. we find high nucleosome density across the hoxb1a tss at 4hpf , but this density is reduced in a region extending from +200 bp to -200 bp in wild type embryos at 9hpf . strikingly, the affected region upstream of the hoxb1a tss is near the r <dig> regulatory element  and nucleosome density in this region is elevated in hoxb1b mutants at 9hpf, suggesting that hoxb1b is involved in depleting nucleosomes in this region coincident with onset of hoxb1a transcription. in contrast, a region downstream of the tss undergoes a reduction in nucleosome density by 9hpf in both hoxb1b mutant and wild type embryos, suggesting that nucleosome changes in this region are independent of hoxb1b and must depend on other factors. taken together, our findings indicate that hoxb1a expression is regulated both by hoxb1b acting, at least in part, to affect nucleosome organization and by ra acting via an unknown pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated several novel germ line mutants for zebrafish hoxb1a and hoxb1b. our analyses indicate that mouse hoxb <dig> and zebrafish hoxb1a have comparable functions, suggesting a conserved role for these genes. in contrast, while mouse hoxa <dig> and zebrafish hoxb1b share functions in the formation of r <dig> and r <dig>  they differ with regards to r <dig> and r <dig>  where hoxa <dig> appears to control formation of r <dig>  but not r <dig>  in the mouse, whereas hoxb1b regulates formation of r <dig>  but not r <dig>  in zebrafish. lastly, our data reveal independent regulation of hoxb1a expression by retinoic acid and hoxb1b in zebrafish.
