BACKGROUND
non-long terminal repeat  retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that propagate by reverse transcription of an rna intermediate. these elements lack terminal repeats and utilize a simplified target-primed reverse transcription  mechanism for their retrotransposition. during tprt, the element-encoded endonuclease cleaves the genomic dna, and reverse transcriptase  uses this break to prime reverse transcription from the element's rna. resulting cdna copy is then integrated into the target site  <cit> .

based on their structure, non-ltr retrotransposons can be classified into two groups. the first group has a single open reading frame  that encodes rt in the middle and a restriction enzyme-like endonuclease  near its c-terminus. the second group of non-ltr retrotransposons has two orfs: orf <dig> and orf2; the latter encodes two domains responsible for retrotransposition: apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease -like endonuclease domain at the n-terminus and rt domain in the middle.

the rt domain has been used to classify non-ltr retrotransposons into phylogenetic groups, or clades  <cit> . originally,  <dig> clades were distinguished among non-ltr retrotransposons. later, the total number of clades increased to  <dig>  with the addition of genie  <cit> , nesl- <dig>  <cit> , ingi, rex <dig>  <cit> , and l <dig> clades  <cit> . this number is likely to increase further since almost every detailed study of non-ltr retrotransposons brings additional information about their phylogeny and diversity  <cit> . for example, a new family encoding both rle and ape endonucleases was described recently  <cit> .

non-ltr retrotransposons represent a large fraction of known retroelements in insects. at the same time, most of our knowledge on distribution and diversity of non-ltr retrotransposons from insects is limited to model organisms such as dipteran genera drosophila, anopheles, and aedes  <cit> . almost nothing is known about many other insect groups. several studies attempted to test a wide range of arthropods for the presence of particular clades, e.g. distribution of r <dig> and r <dig> clades has been explored in detail in different arthropods  <cit> .

our recent study of scorpions  revealed an unexpected diversity of non-ltr retrotransposons within several clades in this ancient arthropod group, with at least three distant clusters in cr <dig> clade  <cit> . previously, only one family, t1q-like elements, was described inside this clade from arthropods  <cit> . studies of non-ltr retrotransposon diversity can provide a valuable contribution into understanding of evolution and spreading of mobile elements in arthropods.

the mode of retrotransposition and phylogenetic studies suggested that evolution of non-ltr retrotransposons proceeds mainly via vertical transmission and random loss of elements from a population  <cit> . horizontal transmission is believed to be a very rare event for this class of retrotransposons. nevertheless, at least one well-documented case of horizontal transmission is known. horizontal transmission of bov-b elements from an ancestral snake lineage  to the ancestor of ruminants has been confirmed on the basis of discontinuous distribution, extreme nucleotide sequence conservation, and phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined the diversity of cr <dig> clade of non-ltr retrotransposons in lycaenid butterflies of the genus maculinea. molecular systematic studies confirmed the existence of seven maculinea species, most of them with several subspecies  <cit> . maculinea arion l., m. alcon , and m. teleius  are widely distributed from western europe to east asia, while m. nausithous  ranges from west europe to central asia. m. cyanecula  is restricted to central asia, while m. arionides  and m. kurenzovi  are found in east asia  <cit> . in europe, maculinea are an object of interest of evolutionary biologists and model species for biodiversity studies since they are considered vulnerable or threatened  <cit>  and also because of their fascinating biology. all maculinea species are characterized by a specialized myrmecophilous lifestyle at larval stage. their caterpillars, after three weeks of phytophagous life on specific food plants drop to the ground where they are adopted to the ant nest by myrmica foraging workers. larvae remain within the nest for a period of approximately  <dig> or  <dig> months, during which time they increase their body mass almost  <dig> times without moulting  <cit> . three maculinea species, m. teleius, m. nausithous and m. arion, are obligatory predators of the ant larvae. however, m. alcon, so-called "cuckoo" species, is a fully integrated social parasite and is fed by workers by trophic eggs and regurgitation  <cit> .

their unusual life history traits, such as parasitic life style, differentiated feeding strategies, exceptions to normal insect growth rules as an adaptation to long starvation period  <cit>  and one or two-year mode of caterpillar's growth, make genus maculinea a very interesting model for evolutionary studies, including studies of non-ltr retrotransposons diversity and evolution. moreover, non-ltr retrotransposons could be very useful as molecular markers in intraspecific phylogeography of maculinea.

we implemented broad analysis for cr <dig> group in an attempt to cover the diversity of cr1-like elements from maculinea butterflies and evaluate the possibilities for development of phylogenetic markers. distinct evolutionary lineages of the cr1-like non-ltr retrotransposons were identified, showing significant variation among cr <dig> clade elements.

surprisingly, retroelements highly similar to one of the detected cr <dig> families have been recently identified in silkworm bombyx mori. we reconstructed the complete element bmcr1b from b. mori using the genomic fragments available in databases. extremely high similarity of b. mori and maculinea elements was intriguing since these lepidopteran species are not closely related. we performed additional pcr screening of butterflies from distinct groups  to evaluate distribution of newly isolated families from cr <dig> clade. cr1a-like elements were found only in family lycaenidae. in contrast, cr1b-like non-ltr retrotransposons were detected in bombycidae moths: silkworm bombyx mori and oberthueria caeca. the degree of coding sequence similarity of the studied elements, their discontinuous distribution and results of divergence-versus-age analysis make it highly unlikely that these sequences diverged at the same time as their host taxa. thus, new evidence was obtained for horizontal transmission of non-ltr retrotransposons.

RESULTS
multiple lineages of cr1-like retroelements represent in maculinea
no retrotransposable elements from maculinea have been previously described. the degenerate oligonucleotide primers used in our study were designed based on sequences of known non-ltr retrotransposons from cr <dig> clade. four species of maculinea were screened by pcr using these degenerate primers , and the pcr products were cloned.

* single clones appeared to be r <dig> elements

in total,  <dig> clones were obtained for cr <dig> clade and sequenced . after preliminary identification of rt fragments by comparison with sequences in the genbank database, we found that  <dig> clones showed clear similarity with rt domain of non-ltr retrotransposons, while three sequences revealed no presence of rt. the total number of clones with rt for each species is listed in table  <dig> 

the blast search showed a strong similarity of translation products of those clones that contained rt to the elements described from cr <dig> clade. in general, the designed pcr primers for cr <dig> proved to be suitable for isolation of an rt domain from maculinea. however, two sequences unexpectedly showed clear similarity to the elements belonging not to cr <dig> but to r <dig> clade of non-ltr retrotransposons. these sequences were named mnar <dig>   and malr <dig>  . representatives of r <dig> clade appear to play a very important role in telomere maintenance in insects  <cit> . for example, tras <dig> and sart <dig> elements from bombyx mori are site-specific for telomeric repeats  <cit> . two isolated maculinea elements shared more than  <dig> % homology in amino acid sequence and were highly similar to r1-like elements from other insects. similarity between amino acid sequences of mnar <dig> and rt <dig> element from anopheles gambiae  <cit>  was  <dig> %. amplification of r <dig> elements using cr <dig> pair of primers could possibly be a result of primer degeneracy.

the majority of detected cr1-like elements revealed defective translated products . in total,  <dig> elements represented putatively intact rt sequences. of  <dig> defective clones,  <dig> has a single stop mutation and no frameshifts, while  <dig> clones contained variable-length indels and resulted in frameshifts.

we conducted both intra- and interspecific comparative analysis of rt nucleotide sequences. presence of several distinct groups was detected . the phylogeny was constructed based on nucleotide sequences of all  <dig> isolated clones. neighbor-joining  analysis demonstrated presence of three clear lineages . two most commonly found types of cr1-like elements in maculinea were designated lineage a  and lineage b  .

lineage a of cr1-like elements from maculinea â€“ maccr1a family
in total,  <dig> clones from all four studied species formed this lineage in nj analysis based on nucleotide sequences of rt domain . comparative analysis of rt nucleotide sequences showed an extremely high similarity among elements both within and between species. average intraspecific sequence similarity ranged from  <dig>  % in m. alcon to  <dig>  % in m. teleius. less than  <dig> % of intraspecific divergence was detected in m. nausithous. three of eight clones isolated from m. alcon appeared to be absolutely identical .

the potential translation products of the sequences were determined. eleven clones contained intact rt sequences and could represent the master sequences of elements with rt activity. eight of isolated elements had stop mutations but no frameshifts. the remaining ten clones contained indels in comparison with the consensus sequence. indels resulted in frame-shifts in five elements. all indels seems to be unique for a specific element copy since single copies were detected for each case of insertion or deletion.

kimura-corrected distances were calculated within and between species using  <dig> selected copies . the average distance was  <dig> % within m. teleius,  <dig> % within m. nauthitous, and  <dig> % within m. alcon. interspecific distances ranged from  <dig> % between m. teleius and m. nausithous to  <dig> % between m. teleius and m. alcon. these low kimura-corrected distances indicate relatively recent retrotransposition events for lineage a elements.

phylogeny of maculinea based on nucleotide sequences of cr-1-like elements was not congruent with the known phylogeny of host species . moreover, no relationships could be reconstructed within lineage a elements. altogether,  <dig> variable sites per  <dig> bp were detected among aligned nucleotide sequences, and  <dig> variable amino acid residues per  <dig> sites of amino acid sequence alignment. however, only six variable sites were parsimoniously informative at dna level, and only two, at amino acid level. other variable sites were represented by singletons and were non-informative for phylogenetic analysis.

lineage b of cr1-like elements from maculinea â€“ maccr1b family
lineage b of cr1-like elements from maculinea butterflies was represented by  <dig> clones. the phylogenetic tree based on nj analysis of nucleotide sequences showed a strong support for separation of this lineage from elements of the lineage a . however, the topology within lineage b was not supported.

a comparative analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences within the lineage b demonstrated high similarity both within and among species. two clones from m. teleius  appeared to be identical; both carried  <dig> bp insertion and  <dig> bp deletion. one more clone mtecr1- <dig> contained  <dig> bp insertion and  <dig> bp deletion. the remaining sequences had no indels; however, two of them  represented interrupted translated products. six sequences seemed to be the copies of putatively intact retrotransposons, with the average genetic distance less than  <dig> %. the most distant copy  showed nucleotide sequence divergence  <dig>  %.

for phylogenetic analysis, we selected eight copies without compensatory frameshift mutations. nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned. variable and parsimoniously informative sites were determined for both alignments. as in maccr1a lineage, number of parsimoniously informative sites was very low. among  <dig> variable sites per  <dig> bp of sequence only eight were informative for phylogenetic analysis while  <dig> substitutions were copy-specific. number of sites with variable amino acid residues was less than in the lineage a, only  <dig> sites per  <dig> amino acid residues. four parsimoniously informative sites were detected, compared to two in lineage a; such low number of informative sites does not allow meaningful phylogeny reconstruction among lineage b. low kimura-corrected distances within and among species  suggest a relatively recent retrotransposon activity.

maccr1a and maccr1b elements were only  <dig>  % similar at dna level but  <dig>  % similar at amino acid level.

lineage c â€“ t1q-like non-ltr retroelements from maculinea
only four retroelements from lineage c were isolated from two species: m. teleius and m. nausithous . mnacr1- <dig> and mnacr1- <dig> showed  <dig> % similarity, whereas mtecr1- <dig> and mtecr1- <dig> differ in length and contain two substitutions per  <dig> bp of common sequence. mtecr1- <dig> sequence is  <dig> bp long; mtecr1- <dig> is truncated at 5' portion and  <dig> bp long. translated products of mtecr1- <dig> and mtecr1- <dig> contain no stop mutations or frameshifts and seem to be putatively intact. mnacr1- <dig> and mnacr1- <dig> clones contained not only stop codons but also frameshifts. we reconstructed the reading frame for mnacr1-6/ <dig> element. comparison of amino acid sequences showed  <dig>  % similarity between mtecr1- <dig> and reconstructed mnacr1-6/ <dig>  but only  <dig>  % similarity was found at the dna level.

elements from maccr1c lineage share high similarity with t <dig> and q elements and seem to belong to the t1q lineage  <cit> . the amino acid sequence similarity ranged from  <dig>  % between mnacr1-6/ <dig> and q element to  <dig>  % between mtecr1- <dig> and q element; the isolated elements were less than 50% similar to the cr <dig> retrotransposon from chicken gallus gallus  <cit> . the t1q lineage was detected from genomes of two out of four studied species of maculinea. one element was isolated from m. nausithous, and two closely related copies, from m. teleius. small fraction of t1q-like elements among isolated clones could be due to a very low copy numbers of this lineage in the studied species. it could be also a consequence of high divergence among the elements in the sequences annealing to pcr primers.

bmcr1b element from b. mori
the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of maccr1a and maccr1b elements were used as queries in blast search against databases for arthropods. no species among those available in databases gave the positive match except of silkworm bombyx mori. maccr1b was found to be present in b. mori genome. surprisingly, cr1b elements from maculinea and b. mori showed extremely high sequence similarity.

based on blast results, we reconstructed non-ltr retrotransposon from b. mori, named bmcr1b . we did not find any genomic fragments containing the entire sequence of bmcr1b element. however, partial bmcr1b sequences from different genomic fragments showed high similarity to each other and the entire sequence of the element could be assembled based on several contigs .

bmcr1b element could be almost completely reconstructed by fusion of two contigs: ctg <dig>  and ctg <dig> . the fragment ctg <dig> lacks approximately  <dig> bp of element at the 3' end. the second contig, ctg <dig>  represents almost entire element bmcr1b but lacks  <dig> bp at 5' end. other contigs contain incomplete sequences of bmcr1b retroelement to a greater extent, either due to their position at a contig border  or to insertion of sequences of an unknown origin .

the 3' end of the bmcr1b element was identified easily since it was terminated by polya track. for reconstruction of the 5' end of element we performed additional blast search using as a query that sequence, which was homologous to ctg <dig>  ctg <dig> and ctg <dig> in their 5' parts. analysis of the 5' part of the bmcr1b from different contigs allowed to identify clearly the 5' end of the element . we expected that the full-length retroelement will be at least  <dig> kb in length and will contain two orfs. however, reconstructed bmcr1b elements are approximately  <dig> bp in length and contain a single putative orf, which encodes a polyprotein with ape and rt domains. polya tail with various lengths was detected at the 3' end of these elements . the putative 5' untranslated region  is  <dig> bp long. the putative 3' utr is very short, only  <dig> bp.

the fragments of bmcr1b element detected in different contigs are highly similar to each other as well as to maccr1b elements. sequence similarity between reconstructed bmcr1b and consensus maccr1b was  <dig>  % at dna level and  <dig> % at amino acid level. similarity between bmcr1b element and consensus maccr1a was  <dig>  % at dna level and  <dig> % at amino acid level .

distribution of cr1b and cr1a families in other butterflies
we designed specific pcr primers for both discovered families  and screened a selection of species from other related groups of lepidoptera. primers were based on sequences isolated from maculinea spp. and bmcr1b element  and tested by pcr and sequencing in all four species of maculinea. the primers annealed specifically either to maccr1a or to maccr1b template.

nine superfamilies and  <dig> families of lepidoptera were selected based on known phylogeny of suborder ditrysia including superfamily bombycoidea . eight species from superfamily papilionoidea were also studied. we included in our analysis three additional species of lycaenidae since we expected to detect either both families or one of them in the genera closely related to maculinea. moreover, representatives of three other families from papilionoidea were screened. we also chose one member of the saturniidae, a bombycoid family closely related to the bombycidae. as an outgroup served the meal moth pyralis farinalis , the most ancient taxon among studied lepidoptera according to the commonly accepted phylogeny  <cit> . oberthueria caeca was included as additional species from family bombycidae.

in total,  <dig> species were used in the further pcr screening in addition to maculinea spp. . we also performed pcr with original degenerate cr <dig> primers  to demonstrate presence of cr <dig> clade in all studied species. all specimens gave us the positive signals with the original cr <dig> primers . the products with the expected size,  <dig> bp in length, were detected by electrophoresis in all reactions. thus, we can assume that all studied species contain cr <dig> clade elements in their genomes.

pcr screening with specific primers demonstrated presence of the cr1a family in all lycaenidae but its lack in all other studied species. pcr products of the expected size were detected in scolitantides orion, shijimaeoides divina, and plebejus argus. the genera scolitantides and shijimaeoides are the closest relatives of maculinea. it appears that cr1a family is found in lycaenidae, but is absent from other butterflies even in closely related families pieridae , nymphalidae , and satyridae . on the other hand, cr1a-like elements could further diverge in other species to the extent that designed primers would be not appropriate for their detection.

the cr1a pcr products were cloned and sequenced for all three species in which cr1a was detected additionally to maculinea spp. elements of cr1a family from s. orion , sh. divina , and p. argus  share high similarity with maccr1a elements. average similarity of the amino acid sequences was  <dig>  % among cr1a-like elements from all investigated lycaenidae. the newly identified cr1a elements from lycaenidae butterflies showed  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  %  value of divergence .

positive results in pcr reaction with cr1b primers were observed for maculinea and representatives of the family bombycidae: o. caeca and b. mori . the cr1b products were cloned and sequenced. surprisingly, the cr1b elements from closely related o. caeca  and b. mori  showed higher level of amino acid sequence divergence than cr1b retrotransposons from maculinea and b. mori . taxa which are most closely related to maculinea, s. orion and sh. divina, did not demonstrate a presence of this family in pcr screening . the discontinuous distribution, high sequence similarity between maccr1b and bmcr1b elements from divergent species and lower similarity between bmcr1b and ocacr1b elements from closely related species could be the evidences for horizontal transmission for non-ltr retrotransposons from cr1b family.

evidence of horizontal transmission
most examples of horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes involve transposable elements  <cit> . such transfers are usually recognized by the presence of very closely related elements in distantly related host taxa. evolutionary dynamics of transposable elements could sufficiently differ even in closely related taxa. as a result, phylogenetic studies of mobile elements often show incongruence with host species phylogenies. first, transposable elements are multicopy components of genomes. thus, comparisons of paralogous copies of these elements instead of orthologs along with varying rates of sequence evolution of mobile elements copies are the main sources for phylogenetic incongruence, which could be misidentified as horizontal transmission. second, random loss of transposable elements from a few taxa, ancestral polymorphism and independent assortment of copies into descendant species, and unequal dna substitution rates in different species all can lead to incongruence in phylogenetic reconstruction.

traditionally, horizontal transfer has been implied when highly similar transposable elements have been found in distantly related taxa accompanied by their discontinuous distribution, and such phenomenon could not be explained in terms of vertical inheritance  <cit> .

we found that cr1b family of retrotransposons has discontinuous distribution in butterflies. it was detected in maculinea spp. and two representatives of family bombycidae: o caeca and silkworm b. mori. no cr1b-like elements were found in the taxa closely related to maculinea. to extend the analysis, we designed several pairs of primers to cover almost the entire bmcr1b element in pcr amplification. these primer pairs were used to screen m. teleius dna. products with appropriate size were obtained for all used primer pairs . this is an indirect evidence of high similarity of elements from b. mori and m. teleius not only in the known sequence of isolated rt fragment but in the entire sequence of bmcr1b and maccr1b.

by comparing the amino acid sequence divergence for host genes and transposable elements evolving under presumably similar selective pressure the case of horizontal transmission could be detected if divergence among mobile elements is significantly lower than that observed for the proteins encoded by host genes. we compared the partial amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the elongation factor  <dig> alpha  gene from maculinea spp. and b. mori since only this nuclear gene from maculinea was available in databases. it is necessary to note that ef-1Î± gene is highly conserved in amino acid sequence and is usually used for reconstruction of high-level phylogenies, especially in insects  <cit> .

the ef-1Î± gene comparisons demonstrated almost the same level of amino acid divergence as the mobile elements from cr1b family,  <dig> % for ef-1a genes and  <dig> % for cr1b elements . the nucleotide sequences of ef-1Î± gene had much lower similarity to each other. only 83% similarity was detected for ef-1Î± gene whereas more than 96% similarity showed bmcr1b and maccr1b non-ltr retrotransposons at dna level. it seems unlikely that 96% nucleotide and  <dig> % amino acid sequence similarity could be selectively or otherwise maintained in retrotransposons that diverged from a common ancestor.

the amino acid sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i  and subunit ii  genes also were compared among studied species. it seems that rt of cr1b elements is considerably more conserved than compared mitochondrial proteins. we found  <dig> % and  <dig> % divergence at the amino acid level in coi and coii genes, respectively and only  <dig> % average divergence between rt bmcr1b and maccr1b elements .

since the last common ancestor  of lepidopteran superfamilies papilionoidea and bombycoidea has been estimated to exist  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , it is very difficult to explain the extreme nucleotide and amino acid conservation, together with the discontinuous distribution, without invoking the horizontal transfer of cr1b elements. we also compared the sequences of other insect non-ltr retrotransposons from cr <dig> and closely related clades for which strong vertical inheritance was suggested . even closely related jockey elements from drosophila melanogaster and d. funebris  were more than 24% divergent. the value of amino acid sequence divergence between maccr1b and bmcr1b was comparable with those among cr1a elements from lycaenidae butterflies and between cr1b elements from closely related o. caeca and b. mori .

overall, our data clearly indicate that the high degree of similarity we observed between the bombyx mori bmcr1b and maculinea cr1b is not due to selection. the only reasonable alternative explanation is horizontal transfer.

horizontal transmission in non-ltr retrotransposons
horizontal transfer can be defined as the process by which genes can move between reproductively isolated species. it is not surprising that many examples of horizontal transfer of transposons have been identified in eukaryotes. there are several features of transposon behavior that make them particularly prone to horizontal transfer. transposable elements have the capacity to insert themselves into the chromosomes of possible vectors and, subsequently, into host chromosomes. subsequent to transfer, they can spread rapidly throughout a given species, as is evidenced by the rapid spread of p elements in d. melanogaster  <cit> . most studied cases of horizontal transmission involve dna transposons  <cit> .

among retrotransposons, several examples of horizontal transfer have been documented between closely related species  for ltr retrotransposons such as copia  <cit>  and gypsy  <cit> . the possible mechanism of horizontal transfer of ltr retrotransposons could be their ability to ride along on cross-species viral infections. the presence of envelope-like coding sequences makes some of the ltr retrotransposons capable of virus-like particle formation.

in contrast, non-ltr retrotransposons are believed to be inherited exclusively vertically. extensive phylogenetic and comparative studies dismissed majority of putative horizontal transfer reports for non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> . nevertheless, strong evidence of horizontal transmission that cannot be neglected, were provided by zupunski et al.   <cit>  for bov-b retroelements which have been relatively recently transferred from the ancestral snake lineage  to the ancestor of ruminant mammals  <cit> . thus, one should not exclude a possibility of occasional horizontal transmission events in non-ltr retrotransposons.

the compared bov-b elements from squamata and ruminantia  showed the same divergence at the amino acid level as that between mus and rattus l <dig> elements . the divergence rate in squamata versus ruminantia bov-b was found to be very low in comparison with other elements from the same clade  <cit> .

the slowdown effect on evolutionary rates was also observed in our study. we estimated sequence divergence rates for non-ltr retrotransposons from insects, including those for cr <dig> and jockey clades . the divergence rates appeared to be almost the same in all comparisons with exception of drosophilid jockey elements and cr1b elements from butterflies. however, while in the case of jockey elements from drosophila melanogaster and d. funebris the rate was much higher in comparison with other pairs, cr1b retrotransposons from b. mori and maculinea spp. showed significantly low rate of divergence. it was much lower than for the elements from closely related species: soricr1a from scolitantides and cr1a from maculinea; bmcr1b from bombyx and ocacr1b from oberthueria .

the actual mechanisms of horizontal transfer are still unknown for mobile elements from eukaryotes since it is not possible experimentally to show how the horizontal transmission can occur. parasites, symbionts, bacteria, or viruses all could be suggested as potential vectors for horizontal transmission. however, only those putative vectors could be under consideration, which have wide host range and access to germ line cells  <cit> . since horizontal transfer detected in present study occurred within butterflies and moths, all viruses and parasites common for lepidoptera could be suspect as possible vectors.

the direction of cr1b retroelements horizontal transfer is also under question. since it is unlikely that horizontal transfer could occur simultaneously and independently to two distantly related taxa, those elements could hardly be transmitted recently to b. mori and genus maculinea from an unknown species. on the other hand cr1b elements were detected not only in b. mori, but also in other representative of bombycidae family â€“ o. caeca. it is highly possible that one of the moths from family bombycidae was a source of the cr1b elements for a common ancestor of maculinea species.

cr1a and cr1b as potential molecular markers
insertion events of retrotransposable elements have been recently demonstrated to be powerful tools in phylogenetics and population genetics studies in various organisms  <cit> . integration of a non-ltr retrotransposon to a new place is an irreversible event. non-ltr retrotransposons, once inserted in chromosomal dna, appear to be fixed. since retrotransposition is thought to be more or less random with respect to the region of insertion, insertions at exactly the same location appear to be unlikely. the most popular transposon-based marker method is the sequence-specific amplification polymorphism approach , also called "transposon display"  <cit> . the s-sap markers were developed for wide range of taxa, in particular in plants  <cit> , insects  <cit> , and fungi  <cit> .

cr1a and cr1b non-ltr retrotransposons from maculinea species showed very high homogeneity among studied species, and thus cannot be used for inferring interspecific phylogenies; however, these elements could be used as markers in population genetics studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrated that lycaenid butterflies from the genus maculinea, a model group in the european biodiversity studies, have multiple lineages of elements from cr <dig> clade. three families of cr1-like elements coexist in the genomes of maculinea spp. t1q lineage showed very low similarity to two other lineages, maccr1a and maccr1b, whereas maccr1a and maccr1b are highly similar to each other and formed a common branch .

sequences with extremely high similarity to maculinea were identified in genome of silkworm bombyx mori. a non-ltr retrotransposon bmcr1b belonging to cr1b lineage was reconstructed based on short fragments available in databases. the distribution of cr1a and cr1b families was studied among  <dig> species of lepidoptera from nine superfamilies. only representatives of the family lycaenidae gave positive signal in pcr amplification for the cr1a lineage. none of the studied species showed presence of cr1b family, except maculinea and two moths from family bombycidae: oberthueria caeca and bombyx mori.

the studied maccr1b and bmcr1b elements are considerably more conserved than the mitochondrial proteins and have the same level of conservation as ef-1Î± protein, one of the most conserved proteins in eukaryotes. in summary, the data are consistent with horizontal transfer of cr1b elements between species of lepidoptera at some point well after the divergence of bombycoidea and papilionoidea. the degree of similarity of coding sequences in these elements, their discontinuous distribution, and the results of divergence-versus-age analysis, make it highly unlikely that these sequences diverged at the same time as their host taxa. a presence of the cr1b family in two closely related species from family bombycidea  allowed us to suppose that horizontal transmission occurred from bombycidae to the common ancestor of maculinea species. this study presents a new example of horizontal transmission of non-ltr retrotransposons from cr <dig> clade.
