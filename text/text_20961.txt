BACKGROUND
glucocorticoids  are a vital class of steroidal hormones that mediate profound and diverse physiological effects in vertebrates. gc are key hormones in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, but other essential functions are assigned to gc as well, such as regulatory roles in development and other metabolic pathways, stress and immune responses, neurobiology, and programmed cell death. in addition, corticosteroids are among the most widely prescribed class of drugs, primarily for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive roles. they are also used in many chemotherapy regimens for leukemias and other cancers due to their critical capability to induce apoptosis.

cortisol and its synthetic derivatives act upon the glucocorticoid receptor , a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. prior to ligand binding, gr is primarily localized within the cytoplasm as an oligomeric complex composed of one receptor polypeptide, two molecules of heat shock protein  <dig> , one molecule each of hsp  <dig>  hsp  <dig>  and hsp <dig>  when the hormone binds to the receptor, the gc-gr complex undergoes conformational changes, followed by dissociation from the hsp complex and dimerization of the gr molecules. the activated gr dimer is translocated into the nucleus and because of its high dna affinity is able to bind to a specific dna sequence named glucocorticoid response element , which is located in the vicinity of the target-regulated gene. the gr-gre complex interacts with other components of the transcription apparatus to either enhance or repress the expression of the targeted gene  <cit> .

there are several molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid resistance or hypersensitivity  and gr expression seems to be a key one. these mechanisms are important for the regulation of cell and tissue-specific gc sensitivity, but they can be pathologically modified in clinical conditions such as aids, glucocorticoid-resistant asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and familial glucocorticoid resistance, among others  <cit> .

evaluation of gr expression in these conditions presents critical restrictions and has been limited to research protocols, partly due to analytical difficulties. methods employed so far include ligand-binding assays, northern and western-blots and pcr. these methods could only provide qualitative or semi-quantitative information and a truly quantitative and reproducible evaluation of gr expression was still needed. in this study, we describe a quantitative real-time pcr  for gr alpha isoform  expression that is suitable for patient monitoring and can be easily reproduced.

RESULTS
grα and bcr  standard-curves were very stable using five different standard preparations, with maximum coefficient of variation  of  <dig> % observed for grα most concentrated standard-point. grα standard-curves presented cvs of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the cycle-thresholds  obtained with each standard . on both genes, standard-curves cv were greater at the most concentrated standard-points. bcr cv was smaller than those observed for grα cv in all standard-points and all standard-curves. standards of  <dig> to  <dig> log of jurkat cells presented, respectively, cv of their ct of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. bcr standard-curves had greater analytical sensitivity than grα, with  <dig> ec/ml versus  <dig> ec/ml.

linear regression analysis of pairs of standard-curves demonstrated strong correlation for both genes. the smallest pearson correlation coefficient on grα curves was  <dig> , but most of them were higher than  <dig> . two pairs of bcr curves showed pearson correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . standard-curves slopes presented a cv of  <dig> % for grα and  <dig> % for bcr . using the t-test, we found this difference in grα and bcr slopes not significant .

pearson's coefficients of correlation of grα and bcr standard-curves for the same pair of experiments are expressed in the upper and lower rows, respectively. a to e refer to different sets of standard constructs, from jurkat cell culture, viable cell count, rna extraction, cdna synthesis, standard dilution and qrt-pcr for grα and bcr with calculations.

intra-assay precision was around 2% for both evaluated controls. cases  <dig> and  <dig> presented, respectively, mean grα-eu of  <dig>  and  <dig> , with sd of  <dig>  and  <dig>  and cv of  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

inter-assay precision was approximately 7% for both cases. cases  <dig> and  <dig> presented, respectively, mean grα-eu of  <dig>  and  <dig> , with sd of  <dig>  and  <dig>  and cv of  <dig> % and  <dig> %.

the median grα-eu values of case  <dig> were similar both in intra and inter-assay evaluations, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig>  . this difference was not considered significant when we applied the mann-whitney rank sum test .

discussion
glucocorticoid resistance and hypersensitivity are determined by a number of factors such as intra-cellular hormone concentration, gr expression levels, grα/grβ heterodimerization, gr gene polymorphisms or mutations and gc-gr-protein interaction, among others  <cit> . one of the major factors affecting gc sensitivity seems to be the expression of its receptor. however, there were methodological difficulties regarding absolute quantitation of gr.

binding assays were initially used to evaluate gr levels, but this assay is labor-intensive , it assess only gr ligand-binding properties in the cytoplasm, providing no information regarding gr in the nucleus and requires the use of radioactive materials. western blot assays were developed to assess gr protein levels. despite numerous efforts to make well-characterized and specific antibodies, to date there are no highly specific human monoclonal antibodies targeted to gr isoforms, preventing the development of true quantitative methods, such as elisa  <cit> . quantitative pcr approaches were difficult until qrt-pcr was developed. quantitative real-time pcr assays are based on cycle-by-cycle fluorescence monitoring of detectable pcr products  and analysis of amplification during the exponential phase of pcr .

three groups recently described qrt-pcr techniques for grα evaluation. derijk et al. developed taqman evaluation of grα and grβ, however they did not describe the use of standard-curves or gene normalization  <cit> . since their group was investigating grα/grβ ratio in the hippocampus, controls were produced using mixtures of pcr products of each isoform quantified by agarose gel densitometry. they found grα/grβ ratio of approximately  <dig> in leukocytes and  <dig> in hippocampal cells suggesting a minor physiological role for grβ in normal cells from these tissues.

boullu-ciocca et al. evaluated grα and grβ expression using real-time pcr in obese and control cases  <cit> . they used 18s mrna as a normalizing gene, but no standard-curves or precision characteristics were described. mononuclear cells from control individuals showed grα/grβ ratio of 32: <dig>  much higher than that observed by derijk and co-workers, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  in patients with gluteofemoral and visceral obesity, respectively. the lack of information about test precision makes interpreting the difference observed in the grα/grβ ratio among the two groups very difficult.

pedersen and vedeckis evaluated two cell lines using real-time pcr for seven different isoforms of gr , total gr  and 18s mrna as normalizing gene  <cit> . standards were plasmid constructs for each isoform. they observed a 1000-fold difference of grα to grβ expression levels and that the major exon  <dig> splicing transcripts are 1a <dig>  1b and 1c. although elegantly designed, the authors conclude that their technique presents excessive variability for routine use. they estimated intra-assay cv to be 13%, inter-assay to be ca. 4%, inter-standard to be ca. 8% and overall cv of 15%. the test performance data was presented in a very succinct way and it was not possible to establish how inter-assay cv was calculated neither how inter-assay cv was smaller than intra-assay.

the aim of this study was to describe and validate the reproducibility for clinical monitoring of absolute quantitation of glucocorticoid receptor alpha isoform using real-time pcr. our approach used a standardized procedure for jurkat cell culture to make cdna standards for both grα and bcr. standard-curves were reproducible, with less than 11% cv for all standards used and pearson correlation coefficient above  <dig>  for most comparisons. intra-assay and inter-assay precision were 2% and 7%, respectively.

the bcr gene, derived from normal chromosome  <dig>  was chosen as an appropriate endogenous control. the gene is ubiquitously expressed, has no reported pseudogenes and is a stringent control for the detection of degradation of rna  <cit> . we found our approach to standard-curve construction to be an advantage of our method, since grα and bcr were equally affected during all phases of standard construction. another probable factor for achieving the precision reported is the similar expression levels and amplification rates of grα and bcr.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we described for the first time a method for quantitation of grα expression with technical characteristics that permit patient monitoring, in a fast, simple and robust way.
