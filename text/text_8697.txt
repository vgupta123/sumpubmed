BACKGROUND
protein phosphorylation is one of the common reversible post-translational modifications involved in the regulation of plant growth and diverse processes  <cit> . various techniques have been developed for specific enrichment of phosphopeptides, among which fe3+-imac   <cit> , tio2-moac   <cit>  and scx  chromatography  <cit>  are the three most common used methods for large-scale phosphoproteome studies. in recent years, through these phosphopeptide enrichment techniques combined with high-accuracy mass spectrometry  and related bioinformatics, many large-scale phosphoproteomic analyses were performed in different plant species, such as arabidopsis thaliana
, oryza sativa
 <cit> , medicago truncatula
 <cit> , glycine max
 <cit> , zea mays
 <cit>  and triticum aestivum
 <cit> . however, knowledge of protein phosphorylation modification in other plant species, especially for members of the poaceae, is far from comprehensive.

vegetative growth rapidly increases the photosynthetic capacity and size of plants, and is vital for biomass accumulation, especially in biofuel plants. brachypodium distachyon l., a member of the pooideae subfamily and a temperate wild annual grass endemic to the mediterranean and middle east  <cit> , has rapidly become a model plant, especially for potential biofuel grasses such as switchgrass . it possesses many attractive attributes such as a small diploid genome of  <dig> mbp, short growth cycle, self-fertility and simple nutrient requirements  <cit>  as well as competence to be efficiently transformed  <cit> .

leaf expansion is a major aspect of plant vegetative growth. it increases light capture, which powers photosynthesis and thus biomass production. considerable works have investigated the mechanisms of leaf expansion , but little is known about post-translational phosphorylation modification of proteins during leaf expansion in the period of rapid vegetative growth. during this period the leaf cell wall undergoes dynamic changes to allow cells to expand, but at the same time cells must maintain the mechanical strength required to resist the forces of turgor pressure  <cit> . during plant growth and development, leaf cell numbers and size are rapidly increasing and cell walls must adapt to these changes. the components and mechanisms of underlying signaling systems to achieve this process remain largely unknown, but emerging evidences have implicated several receptor-like kinases as regulators of cell wall function .

interactions of protein kinases  with their substrates are to a large extent determined by residues surrounding the phosphorylation sites and the pattern of residues is named as a phosphorylation motif  <cit> . motif-x analysis of large phosphorylation site data sets can detect significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs and predict the corresponding pks  <cit> . schwartz et al.
 <cit>  used motif-x to determine phosphorylation motifs in yeast, fly, mouse, and man. trost et al.
 <cit>  found eight specific phagosomal phosphorylation motifs induced by ifn-γ. bennetzen et al.
 <cit>  used motif-x to analyze phosphorylation sites during dna damage responses and identified a novel  motif, confirming that motif-x is a powerful program for revealing significant and novel phosphorylation motifs.

recently, a large-scale proteomic and phosphoproteomic study of b. distachyon leaves under salt stress was performed in our laboratory  <cit> . in the present study, we focused on phosphorylation modification during seedling leaf growth and development at the omics level for the first time in b. distachyon and revealed a complicated phosphorylation signal transduction network during rapid leaf growth and development.

RESULTS
identification of phosphorylation sites and phosphoproteins
in this study, a large-scale phosphoproteome analysis in b. distachyon seedling leaves was performed to explore the complex protein phosphorylation network of signaling and regulatory events. the strategy used in this study is shown in figure  <dig>  to increase the number of identified phosphopeptides and eliminate false positives, three biological replicates were used for phosphopeptide enrichment and lc-ms/ms analysis. a total of  <dig> phosphopeptides containing  <dig> phosphorylation sites were identified . the raw mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium  via the pride partner repository  <cit>  with the dataset identifier pxd <dig>  only the phosphopeptides with unambiguous  phosphorylation sites identified from three biological repeats were used for further analysis. finally, the  <dig> unambiguous phosphorylation sites distributed in  <dig> phosphopeptides, corresponding to  <dig> phosphoproteins, were screened and used for further analysis . among the  <dig> unambiguous phosphorylation sites,  <dig> ser,  <dig> thr, and  <dig> tyr phosphorylation sites were identified, accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total sites, respectively . for the lower identification of phosphorylated tyrosine, there are three possible reasons: first, we didn’t perform focused analysis during ms runs in this study, which may lead to the reduced discovery of the low abundant tyr phosphopeptides; second, the recovery rate of phospho-tyr peptides could be different because of the enrichment techniques and data processing softwares; third, different organs, development stages or stress treatments can also lead to the variation of the phospho-tyr identification. the review by ghelis  <cit>  also gave similar explanations for the lower phospho-tyr proportion in plants. the distributions of phosphorylation sites in phosphopeptides and phosphoproteins were shown in figure  <dig>  panel b and c, respectively. among the  <dig> phosphopeptides,  <dig>  of them each contained one phosphorylation sites, only  <dig>  contained two and  <dig>  contained three phosphorylation sites . from the phosphoprotein perspective,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig> phosphoproteins were detected to have  <dig> and  <dig> phosphorylation sites, respectively. one hundred and twenty seven phosphoproteins contained more than two phosphorylation sites, of which  <dig> had at least five phosphorylation sites. two phosphoproteins  each possessed  <dig> phosphorylation sites . the representative mass spectra of all the seven phosphopeptides of bradi1g <dig>  containing the  <dig> phosphorylated sites were shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> figure  <dig>

in order to obtain an overview of phosphorylation events in seedling leaves of b. distachyon, all of the  <dig> identified phosphoproteins were used to perform go, pfam annotation. finally,  <dig> of them were annotated by blast2go and  <dig> of them possessed pfam domains . significantly  enriched go items of biological process, molecular function and cellular component are shown in figure  <dig>  both the percent and p-value of each item were displayed to evaluate these go items. from the biological process perspective, “nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process ”, “response to stimulus ”, “protein modification process ”, “cellular component organization ”, “transport ”, and “cellular amino acid and derivative metabolic process ” were over-represented . from the cellular component perspective, “membrane ” and “nucleus ” were significantly enriched . from the molecular function perspective, “protein binding ”, “nucleotide binding ”, “kinase activity ” and “dna binding ” were the highly enriched molecular function items .figure  <dig>

conservation and kegg pathway analyses of phosphoproteins
to investigate the conservation of phosphoproteins between b. distachyon and other plant species, the sequences of the  <dig> b. distachyon phosphoproteins were used as queries to blast a phosphoprotein database which were constructed based on datasets from p3db   <cit> , more   <cit>  and phosphat  <dig>   <cit> . oryza sativa and arabidopsis thaliana, as the model species of monocots and dicots, respectively, possess more comprehensive phosphorylaton information than other species. recently, a large phosphoprotein dataset of the model legume medicago truncatula was released  <cit> . b. distachyon was therefore compared with the three species to determine the degree of conservation of the phosphoproteins among them. the threshold was set as score ≥  <dig>  e–value < 1e– <dig> and identity ≥ 30%. finally,  <dig>  phosphoproteins were identified with phosphorylation orthologs in all the three species,  <dig>  had phosphorylation orthologs in two of the three species, and  <dig>  had phosphorylation orthologs in only one species . only  <dig> phosphoproteins had no phosphorylation orthologs in the three species. the conserved analysis results are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  further biological process enrichment analysis of the  <dig> highly conserved phosphoproteins  showed that “cellular protein modification process ” and “signal transduction ” were significantly over-represented from the total identified phosphoproteins .

to reveal the phosphoprotein-associated pathways, the  <dig> phosphoproteins were mapped to kegg;  <dig> b. distachyon kegg pathways with not less than  <dig> hits were highlighted by the phosphoproteins identified in this study . many fundamental biological pathways were highlighted by the mapping of phosphoproteins from this work, including carbohydrate metabolism involving carbon metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , pyruvate metabolism  and pentose phosphate pathway , energy metabolism including carbon fixation , starch and sucrose metabolism  and oxidative phosphorylation , and nucleotide metabolism including purine metabolism . for genetic information processing, transcription in spliceosomes , translation related to rna transport , ribosome  and mrna surveillance  were highly enriched. two signal transduction pathways were particularly evident: the plant hormone signal transduction pathway  and the phosphatidylinositol signaling system . further analysis of the  <dig> highly conserved phosphoproteins-related pathways showed that carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism-associated pathways, splicing, rna transport and mrna surveillance pathways stood out . the result of kegg pathway analysis was consistent with that from go analysis, indicating that the methods used here were effective and reliable.

phosphorylation of transcription factors
in growth and development of plants, many transcription factors  are affected through phosphorylation by pks or dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases , which in turn either positively or negatively regulate tf activity in facilitating a program of gene expression that results in changed cell behavior  <cit> . based on go and kegg pathway analyses, transcription-associated proteins were one of the most significant groups of all phosphoproteins, and tfs particularly were the main constituents. fifty eight tfs belonging to  <dig> different families were identified  based on alignments of our phosphoproteins with b. distachyon tfs in planttfdb   <cit> . in planttfdb, there are  <dig> b. distachyon tfs classified into  <dig> families. to determine the tf families significantly regulated by phosphorylation, a tf family enrichment test was performed from  <dig> tf families contained  <dig> tfs compared with the background set . the number of phosphorylated tfs belonging to a tf family was compared against the total number of tfs in that family of b. distachyon. finally,  <dig> significantly over-represented  tf families  were found . bd <dig> is diploid inbred line with its genome size about 272 mb and contains  <dig>  gene loci, coding for  <dig>  distinct mrna molecules  <cit> . genes of all the  <dig> tfs were localized in the five brachypodium chromosomes . the distribution of the six significantly over-represented tf families had no obvious chromosomal preference.table  <dig>

phosphorylation motif enrichment analysis
to date, about  <dig>  and  <dig>  phosphorylation sites representing nearly  <dig> and  <dig> phosphoproteins in p3db have been found in a. thaliana and o. sativa, respectively  <cit> . for a. thaliana, phosphat  <dig>  contains  <dig>  experimental phosphorylation sites and  <dig> phosphoproteins  <cit> . in addition, a large dataset for the model legume m. truncatula containing  <dig>  phosphorylation sites localized in  <dig> phosphoproteins was available in more  <cit> . phosphorylation modification of these sites are regulated by pks, which account for about  <dig> % of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . different pks have preference for specific substrates, and many kinase-associated phosphorylation motifs have been deciphered . the motif-x online tool was used in this study to identify the phosphorylation motifs, and  <dig> different motifs were enriched, including  <dig> ser and  <dig> thr motifs . the phosphoproteins containing each of the  <dig> motifs  were further used in go enrichment analysis. as shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  dna binding or rna binding was enriched from phosphoproteins with the motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  whereas translation factor activity was enriched from phosphoproteins with the motifs  <dig> or  <dig>  phosphoproteins containing motifs  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> were mainly involved in the cell cycle and located in ribosomes. lipid binding and receptor activity were over-represented from motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and tropism was enriched from phosphoproteins containing the motif  <dig>  organic cyclic compound binding and heterocyclic compound binding functions were enriched from the novel motif  <dig>  no go terms were significantly enriched from phosphoproteins containing motifs  <dig> or  <dig> figure  <dig> 
significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs. among these motifs,  <dig> are known phosphorylation motifs, and  <dig> are newly identified . detailed information and putatively associated kinases are shown in additional file 7: table s <dig> 



according to the literature and databases ,  <dig> of these motifs were specific to known pks and  <dig> had no corresponding known kinases . ten known motifs included proline-directed motifs such as   and  , which were potential substrates of mitogen-activated pk , cyclin-dependent kinase  and cdk-like kinase. basic motifs   and   were recognized by growth-associated histone kinase , cdk or cell division cycle  <dig>  kinase.   was recognized by calcium/calmodulin-dependent pk ii .   was recognized by c-terminal src kinase-homologous kinase  <dig> . acidic motifs   and   were recognized by casein kinase-ii . the other  <dig> phosphorylation motifs had no known specific kinases and were therefore regarded as novel phosphorylation motifs found in b. distachyon. further analysis of these motifs showed that  , as a basic motif, is a combination of   and  ; and this motif may be recognized by mapk, cdk or camk.   is similar to , which is recognized by glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> , mapk or cdk <dig>    may be recognized by ckii  <cit> . further inspection of the  <dig> phosphoproteins containing multiple phosphorylation sites  showed that  <dig> of them possessed at least one of the  <dig> phosphorylation motifs . among them,  <dig> phosphoproteins possessed two or more kinds of motifs. phosphorylation sites of most phosphoproteins were motif-specific, but some other phosphoproteins each contained multiple phosphorylation sites belonging the same motif. two phosphoproteins  each contained four phosphorylation sites specific to one motif . this suggests that most phosphoproteins with multiple sites are regulated by multiple pks, and a small part of them are activated by only one kind of pks. the phosphoprotein bradi1g <dig>  contained eight phosphorylation sites belonging to five kinds of motifs , which may be regulated by different pks such as mapk, cdk and ck-ii. conservation analysis showed that phosphorylation orthologs in other species were also identified as phosphoproteins with many phosphosites, and  <dig> of the  <dig> identified phosphorylation sites in bradi1g <dig>  were also identified in other species whereas the other three were the newly identified phosphorylation sites present only in b. distachyon .figure  <dig>

phosphorylation of pks and pps
there are  <dig> pks and  <dig> pps in arabidopsis according to plantsp   <cit> . in this study,  <dig> pks and  <dig> pps were identified as phosphoproteins . to identify the interactions between the phosphorylated pks and pps and their potential substrates, protein-protein interaction  analysis was conducted by using the search tool for retrieval of interacting genes/proteins . all  <dig> eukaryotic orthologous groups   representing  <dig> of the  <dig> phosphoproteins were used to construct the phosphoprotein interaction network. to improve the accuracy of ppi analysis, the confidence level  was set to a high value . finally, a complicated ppi network centered by pks and pps was constructed and displayed by using cytoscape software . depending on the homology comparison with the pks and pps of arabidopsis in the plantsp database, the phosphorylated pks and pps identified in our study were classified into six classes : transmembrane receptor kinases and related non-transmembrane kinases, atn1/ctr1/edr1/gmpk6-like kinases, casein kinase i, non-transmembrane pks, other kinases, and plant phosphatases.table  <dig>

mapk cascades are universal signal transduction modules in plants and are involved in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses, hormones, cell division and developmental processes  <cit> . activation of a mapk cascade can lead to changes in gene expression relating to cell wall biogenesis  <cit> . mapk cascades contained three pk families, the mapk, mapk kinase  and mapk kinase kinase  families. in this study, one mapk , one map2k  and five mekk  were identified as phosphoproteins, and conserved among b. distachyon, o. sativa, a. thaliana and m. truncatula , clearly indicating the fundamental roles of mapk cascades in plants. a sub-network  centered by mekk, map2k and mapk was extracted from the whole ppi network mentioned above. from the sub-network, the mapk family was the crucial pk in mapk cascades and directly activated the substrates, so most phosphoproteins including many other kind of pks  interacted with mapk. mapk and many other pks such as ck <dig> and snt <dig> and pp2c were activated by map2k whereas map2k was activated by mekk. many phosphoproteins interacted simultaneously with mekk and mapk  or map2k and mapk , and some interacted with mekk, map2k and mapk . several pks and pps, including gsk <dig>  pdk <dig>  dspk and pp <dig>  were also regulated by both mekk and mapk whereas only dspp was regulated by both map2k and mapk. two phosphorylation sites  were identified from bdmapk  and one of them was phosphorylated at tyr <dig>  an arabidopsis mapk  is phosphorylated at a tyr residue during the activation process  <cit> . a previous study revealed that plant mapks contained a conserved phosphorylation motif,   <cit> . interestingly, the bdmapk we identified also contains this motif. besides, we identified phosphorylation of  <dig> bdcdpks and  <dig> bdcdks, which may function in defense response and regulation of cell division and differentiation .figure  <dig>

phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins
in plants, many signal pathways are involved in vegetative growth. in the present study, kegg pathway analysis showed that the plant hormone signal transduction pathway  and phosphatidylinositol signaling system  played important roles through phosphorylation modification of some crucial proteins. the hormones include cytokinin, abscisic acid, ethylene and brassinosteroid which mainly regulate cell division, cell elongation and shoot initiation. a homolog of type-b arabidopsis response regulator  was found in the cytokinin regulated pathway. b-arr is a dna-binding transcriptional regulator, whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation of its phospho-accepting receiver domain through the his-kinase-mediated his to asp phosphorelay and lack of this domain disturbs the development of young seedlings  <cit> . likewise, other conserved phosphoproteins including a bzip tf , two ethylene-insensitive protein  and three serine/threonine pks  were involved in the abscisic acid, ethylene or brassinosteroid regulated signal transduction pathways. another signal transduction pathway shown by kegg was the phosphatidylinositol signaling system  that is associated with cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase  acts as a lipid phosphatase to produce phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -biphosphate p2). phosphatidylinositol-4- phosphate 5-kinase  is involved in ptdinsp <dig> synthesis. phosphoinositide phospholipase c  mediates the production of second messenger molecules diacylglycerol  and inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate  by hydrolysis of ptdinsp <dig>  the three enzymes were all identified as phosphoproteins .

phosphorylation of proteins related to cell wall expansion
the poaceae family can be distinguished from most other land plants by the composition of their cell walls  <cit> . b. distachyon is a good model for cell wall  studies of temperate grasses  <cit> . cell wall loosening is essential for leaf expansion during vegetative growth of plants, and this must be balanced with polymer synthesis and wall restrengthening to prevent the cell wall from rupture. multiple receptor-like pks  are implicated in cell wall signaling  <cit> . the rlk , a conserved phosphoprotein among b. distachyon, o. sativa and a. thaliana, was phosphorylated at ser <dig> . hématy et al.
 <cit>  found a rlk  mediating the response of growing plant cells to inhibition of cellulose synthesis in arabidopsis and that it can be phosphorylated at a thr residue. the phosphorylation of rlk identified in our study may be involved in cell wall remodeling during leaf development. a wall-associated receptor kinase , as a kind of rlk, has the potential to serve as both linkers of the cell wall to the plasma membrane and as a signaling molecule. waks also function in pathogen response and cell expansion and elongation  <cit> . wak proteins contain a cytoplasmic ser/thr kinase  domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extra cytoplasmic region with several epidermal growth factor  repeats  <cit> . interestingly, the phosphorylated site of this bdwak was located on the c-terminal  in our study, which was outside these domains above. as a kind of rlk, phosphorylation of this bdwak may regulate functions of itself and further mediate the phosphorylation of enzymes involved in synthesis of cellulose in cell walls.

the primary cell walls of grasses consist mainly of cellulose, arabinoxylan and uniquely -β-d-glucan, small quantities of structural proteins, and low levels of pectin and xyloglucan . cellulose is by far the most abundant biological polymer on earth, and is synthesized by cellulose synthase  contained in plasma membrane–localized complexes. in a. thaliana, cesa <dig>  cesa <dig> and cesa <dig> interact with each other and are largely responsible for cellulose production during formation of the primary cell wall , whereas three types of cesa subunits  are required for secondary cell wall formation  <cit> . in addition, cesa <dig>  cesa <dig>  and cesa <dig> also function in primary cell wall synthesis  <cit> . this study identified  <dig> phosphoproteins as different cesas in b. distachyon, namely bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> . representative ms/ms spectra of phosphopeptides bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig> are shown in additional file 10: figure s <dig>  panel a and b, respectively. atcesa <dig> expressed in all organs except root hairs, and lack of atcesa <dig> expression can lead to stunted growth of hypocotyls in seedlings and greatly reduced seed production in mature plants  <cit> . all cellulose synthases described to date have shown conserved structural features  <cit> . the amino n-terminal of the cesa protein contains a ring finger domain with a strongly conserved cxxc motif   <cit> . the ring finger domain is a small zinc-binding domain found in many functionally distinct proteins  <cit> . kurek et al.
 <cit>  confirmed that ghcesa <dig> formed homodimers as well as heterodimers with ghcesa <dig> through a zinc-binding domain. chu et al.
 <cit>  demonstrated that atcesa <dig> could homodimerize and the zinc finger domain of atcesa <dig> was important for the interaction. sequence analyses indicated that all six identified bdcesas contained a ring finger domain with a conserved cxxc motif . there are  <dig> transmemberane regions in bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig>  bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig>  but there is no the second transmemberane region in bdcesa <dig> and bdcesa <dig>  all phosphorylation sites identified from these bdcesas are located between the ring finger domain and transmemberane region i. nühse et al.
 <cit>  performed a plasma membrane phosphoproteomics in arabidopsis and revealed that cesa <dig>  cesa <dig>  and cesa <dig> proteins were phosphorylated at several sites clustered in the two hypervariable regions. chen et al.
 <cit>  found that phosphorylation of cesa <dig> differentially affects polar interaction with microtubules and may regulate the length or quantity of a subset of cellulose microfibrils in the primary cell wall. the region with phosphorylation sites in each bdcesa belonged to hypervariable region i . phosphorylation of atcesa <dig> was linked to its degradation via a 26s proteasome-dependent pathway  <cit> . it seems that phosphorylation of the  <dig> bdcesas may play vital roles in cell expansion during rapid vegetative growth of brachypodium.

-β-d-glucan is mainly detected in some families of the poales
 <cit> . recently, various genes involved in -β-d-glucan synthesis were identified  <cit> . they belong to two grass-specific families  of the cellulose synthase-like  gene superfamily. in the present study, two csl proteins bdcslf <dig>  and bdcslh <dig>  were identified as phosphoproteins. in developing barley coleoptiles, the transcript levels of hvcslf <dig> are maximal in 4- to 5-d coleoptiles, at the time when -β-d-glucan content of coleoptile cell walls also reaches its maximum level  <cit> . hvcslh <dig> protein is responsible for β-glucan deposited in cell walls of transgenic arabidopsis
 <cit> . in b. distachyon, the cslh gene showed a much higher transcript level and played a prominent role in -β-d-glucan synthesis  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, tio2-enriched phosphopeptides in bd <dig> seedling leaves detected by lc-ms/ms, and maxquant software were used to identify the phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites. to our knowledge, this is the first large-scale phosphoproteome analysis in b. distachyon and provides an overview of in vivo phosphorylation events in seedling leaves. a total of  <dig> phosphoproteins containing  <dig> unambiguous phosphorylation sites were identified. in-depth go, conservation, and kegg pathway analyses of these phosphoproteins revealed the phosphorylation profiling during rapid seedling leaf growth. go analysis showed that the  <dig> phosphoproteins mainly functioned in protein binding, nucleotide binding and kinase activity. conservation analysis revealed that  <dig>  of the phosphoproteins had phosphorylation orthologs in other species. many fundamental biological pathways and two signal transduction pathways were identified through kegg pathway analysis.

fifty eight tfs,  <dig> pks and  <dig> pps were identified from the large dataset and analyzed in depth. thirteen enriched motifs specific for various ser/thr pks were identified from b. distachyon. a total of  <dig> phosphoproteins contained multiple phosphorylation sites and  <dig> of them contained two or more phosphorylation motifs. several signal transduction and cell wall expansion associated phosphoproteins that may have vital functions in the rapid growth of b. distachyon seedling leaves were found such as b-arr, pten, cesa and csl. our overall results provide an important resource for further research and new insights into the regulation of protein post-translational phosphorylation during rapid vegetative growth of poaceae species.
