BACKGROUND
glucosinolates  are amino acid-derived nitrogen- and sulphur-containing plant secondary metabolites characteristic for most families of the order brassicales  <cit> . altogether there are about  <dig> known naturally occurring gs structures  <cit> , of which various ecotypes of the model organism arabidopsis thaliana have about  <dig>  <cit> . depending on the amino acid precursor gs could be divided into three groups:  aliphatic gs derived from leucine, isoleucine, valine, and methionine;  aromatic gs derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine; and  indole gs derived from tryptophan. the biosynthesis of gs proceeds through three separate phases, the chain elongation of selected precursor amino acids, the formation of the core gs structure, and finally modifications of the side chain. several genes of the biosynthetic network and key regulators for gs present in arabidopsis are known  <cit> . the formation of the gs core structure is widely elucidated and genes responsible for secondary modifications of aliphatic gs via oxygenations, hydroxylations, alkenylations and benzoylations have been identified  <cit> . indole gs can undergo hydroxylations and methoxylations, with cyp81f <dig> identified as the gene responsible for 4-hydroxylation of indol-3-ylmethyl gs  in arabidopsis <cit>  , together with further members of the cyp81f family of arabidopsis thaliana as being involved in 4-hydroxylation of indol-3-ylmethyl gs and/or 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs biosynthesis  <cit> . when tissue is damaged, the thioglucoside linkage of gs is hydrolyzed by myrosinases, enzymes that are spatially separated from gs in intact tissue. in the presence or absence of specifier proteins the degradation results in the formation of a variety of hydrolysis products  <cit> .

the different groups of gs and their various degradation products are extensively studied metabolites. it has been shown that genes encoding enzymes of the specific glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways form stable co-expression clusters  <cit> , and group together with tryptophan biosynthetic genes in response to stress conditions  <cit> . with respect to plant fitness they play important roles in plant defence against herbivores  <cit>  and pathogens  <cit> , and also abiotic stresses like uv-b irradiation specifically changes the gs profile  <cit> . in addition, there is increasing evidence that evolutionary and ecological forces shape polymorphism at loci involved in the gs-myrosinase defence system  <cit> .

brassica vegetables are cultivated and consumed worldwide and represent a highly important component in the human diet  <cit> . their content of gs is varying dependent on genotype, development and environmental conditions  <cit>  while the composition of gs and their respective degradation products is a major determinant of the characteristic flavor and smell of brassica vegetables  <cit> . in addition, the secondary metabolites and their respective degradation products are believed to have protective cancer-preventing activity in higher animals and humans  <cit> . however, recent studies also provide evidence that juices of brassicaceae might also be mutagenic because they form characteristic dna adducts in bacteria and mammalian cells  <cit> . it is namely the 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs and its degradation products that have been shown to exert these negative effects  <cit> .

with this study new genes where identified that are involved in the biosynthesis of indole gs, namely the synthesis of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs with focus on brassica vegetables. after establishing the leafy brassica vegetable pak choi  as suitable tool to elicit very high concentrations of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs by application of methyl jasmonate   <cit>  the identification of genes involved in this process was possible by comparing expression pattern in pak choi using the  <dig> × 104 k format brassica array with publicly available gene expression data from the arabidopsis atgenexpress effort  <cit> . with the functional characterization of the identified genes new genetic tools for breeding healthy vegetables with improved gs composition will be possible in the near future.

RESULTS
increased indole gs biosynthesis in pak choi treated with methyl jasmonate
in a previous study it was shown that different cultivars of the leafy vegetable pak choi  contain a certain amount of indole gs in their green leaf tissue  <cit> . the different cultivars can be classified in distinct groups depending on their gs profiles, which are partly linked to the expression of specific genes involved in the aliphatic gs biosynthetic pathway. in a related study it was further demonstrated that a small set of elicitors known to induce gs biosynthesis in various organism is also functional in pak choi  <cit> . amongst others it was namely methyl jasmonate  that led to an increase of indole gs biosynthesis. in order to further characterize this induction of gs biosynthesis in pak choi seedlings in more detail a concentration series ranging from 100 μm to 3 mm was applied and gs accumulation was measured 48 hours after application . as shown in figure 2a a doubling of specific aliphatic gs could be achieved when applying concentrations of more than 750 μm meja, and also the amount of the aromatic 2-phenylethyl gs was increased up to 3fold at such high concentrations applied. as expected, indole gs accumulation was more sensitive to the meja application, and the indole gs level was elevated even when the lowest concentration of 100 μm was used . with the application of higher concentrations of meja up to 2 mm a further increase of indole gs levels could be achieved until no additional elevation was detected. notably it was mainly the 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs that was increased up to 30fold in pak choi seedlings after treatment with meja.

it is known for a long time that jasmonate, ethylene and salicylic acid upregulate the expression of scores of defense-related genes  <cit> , and our knowledge of the complex network of jasmonate signaling in stress responses and development including hormone cross-talk is continuously increasing  <cit> . with respect to plant resistance gs present classical examples of compounds affecting insect-plant interactions  <cit>  in which the gs-myrosinase defence system is also evolutionary and ecological modulated  <cit> . in terms of plants defense against pathogens it is further suggested that tryptophan-derived metabolites may act as active antifungal compounds  <cit> . against this background the induced gs biosynthesis was strongly expected in pak choi after treatment with meja.

specific induction of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs in pak choi seedlings
in order to analyze the specificity of the increased indole gs biosynthesis in more detail a similar experiment with arabidopsis seedlings was performed using meja concentrations ranging from 200 μm up to 5 mm. as evident from figure  <dig> meja application also increased indole gs content in arabidopsis . however, the increase was much lower in this plant species, and the major elevation was found in the non-methoxylated indol-3-ylmethyl gs. further experiments demonstrated that pak choi seedlings exert stronger rise of indole gs levels upon meja application than adult plants  <cit> , while in arabidopsis no differences in the elevation between seedlings and adult rosette leaves were detectable . this comparison with arabidopsis thaliana col- <dig> ecotype clearly revealed that a very strong raise of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs is specific to pak choi. the unambiguous difference between seedlings of pak choi and arabidopsis discovered in this glucosinolate profiling analyses was used in further experiments to identify related genes involved in 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs biosynthesis of brassica rapa ssp. chinensis.

identification of candidate genes using gene expression analysis with the brassica microarray
as strong induction of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs was found 48 hours after application of 2 mm meja to pak choi seedlings gene expression differences to control treatments were analyzed in these samples using the brassica microarray. in order to get maximum amount of information the  <dig> × 104 k array was chosen in the investigation. the elements on the brassica array were identified by their homology to known genes of arabidopsis thaliana and were classified to respective bins using mapman  <cit>  and mercator  <cit> . as expected when meja was applied to plant seedlings, defense related genes showed the most significantly changed transcript levels . with respect to a putative function in gs metabolism  <cit>  the genes with highest expression differences are listed in table  <dig>  mainly the transcripts of genes putatively involved in gs degradation were induced, but also genes involved in indole gs core structure formation were strongly elevated and among the most significantly changed. the increased expression of genes specifically involved in indole gs core structure biosynthesis reflects the elevation of indole gs levels. among the most significantly altered transcripts candidates were selected that are putatively involved in side chain modification of indole gs biosynthesis, namely those that show typical structures of the large gene families of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases or o-methyltransferases .

the brassica 95 k unigene set was compared to arabidopsis thaliana tair <dig> genome release and mapped to mapman bins. respective brassica identifiers are shown, and relative changes to controls are given as log2-ratios. grading of sequence similarity scores of the comparison with arabidopsis sequences is as follows: highly similar, 501–1000; moderately similar, 201–500; weakly similar, 101– <dig>  a, stress related, mapman bincode20; b, sulfur assimilation and glucosinolate metabolism, mapman.

arabidopsis 
the brassica 95 k unigene set was compared to arabidopsis thaliana tair <dig> genome release and mapped to mapman bins. respective brassica identifiers are shown, and relative changes to controls are given as log2-ratios. grading of sequence similarity scores of the comparison with arabidopsis sequences is as follows: highly similar, 501–1000; moderately similar, 201–500; weakly similar, 101– <dig>  genes with significantly altered expression and similarity to arabidopsis genes with function in gs metabolism and genes with significantly altered expression and similarity to candidate genes of the gene families of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases and o-methyltransferasese are listed.

these selected candidates were further evaluated regarding respective expression differences of the related homologs in available arabidopsis thaliana microarray hybridization experiments using the genevestigator database  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig> the arabidopsis homologs of the selected genes involved in gs metabolism were found responsive to meja treatments with log2-ratios being  <dig> or greater. this is in good agreement with the reported modulation of the gs profile in arabidopsis by defense signaling pathways  <cit>  and is also reflected in results presented in figure  <dig>  the arabidopsis homologs of the selected candidate genes show strong variation in their responsiveness to meja. while at3g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  were strongly induced by meja application, at4g <dig> , at4g <dig>  and at5g <dig>  were only weakly influenced, while at4g <dig>  and at1g <dig>  showed unchanged expression. as at1g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at3g <dig> were already expected to be involved in other metabolic pathways we concentrate in further experiments on at4g <dig> and at4g <dig> as genes putatively involved in gs metabolism, and on at4g <dig> and at5g <dig> without any linked pathway identified so far.

the genevestigator database  <cit>  was used to evaluate expression differences of the selected genes. arabidopsis genes homologous to the identified meja responsive brassica genes are in the same order as in table  <dig>  grading of changes of the log2-ratios is as follows:  <dig>  unchanged with log2-ratio smaller  <dig> ; +, log2-ratio between  <dig>  and 1; ++, log2-ratio between  <dig> and  <dig> ; +++, log2-ratio larger than  <dig> .

gs profiling in arabidopsis mutants with knock out of the respective candidate gene homologs
in order to verify a putative involvement of the selected candidate genes in indole gs biosynthesis respective arabidopsis knock out mutants were profiled for their gs accumulation. since there are tissue specific differences in the proportional distribution of individual gs with indole gs being mainly present in either roots or old leaves  <cit>  plants were grown in tissue culture and leaves and roots analyzed separately, or gs profiles of leaves of flowering plants grown in the greenhouse were measured . as evident from table  <dig> there is one of the four selected arabidopsis knock out mutants that did not produce 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs in any of the tissues analyzed. this confirms the expectation that the arabidopsis gene product of at4g <dig>  is needed in leaves and roots to synthesize 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs  <cit> . the absence of a metabolic phenotype on gs level in the selected arabidopsis mutant with knock out in the selected o-methyltransferase  further shows that at least in arabidopsis there are other o-methyltransferases present which could contribute to the synthesis of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs in leaves. consequently, it needs to be analyzed whether the o-methyltransferase activity is provided through igmt <dig>  an o-methyltransferase family protein that is strongly co-expressed with at4g <dig>  as determined using the atted-ii coexpression database  <cit> . in addition, in arabidopsis there are further members of the o-methyltransferase family, igmt <dig> , igmt <dig>  and igmt <dig> , that are coexpressed with at5g <dig> . at least in an artificial expression system using nicotiana benthamiana it has been shown that igmt <dig> and igmt <dig> can be employed for o-methylation of indole gs  <cit> .

as shown previously there is a certain increase of indole gs biosynthesis in arabidopsis after application of meja . therefore, the selected knocks out mutants of genes responsive to meja treatment  were also analyzed after application of this elicitor. while mutants in atcyp81f <dig> and atcyp81d <dig> showed a comparable increase of indole gs biosynthesis as the treated control plants , the mutant in atcyp81f <dig> did not accumulate any 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs while an expected increase of the precursor indol-3-ylmethyl gs could be observed 48 hours after meja application in this mutant. this finally confirms that the gene product of at4g <dig>  the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase 81f <dig> is utterly necessary to synthesize 1-methoxy-indole-3-ylmethyl gs in arabidopsis at standard growth conditions. it additionally demonstrates that there is none of the other p <dig> monooxygenase 81f family proteins involved in 1-methoxy-indole-3-ylmethyl gs synthesis even under conditions of increased biosynthesis when defense related pathways are induced.

arabidopsis ecotype wu- <dig> without 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs accumulation
further evidence of the importance of at4g <dig>  for 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs biosynthesis is coming from a survey of the gs content in leaves and roots of the  <dig> key accessions  <cit>  used to develop the magic lines  <cit> . a total of  <dig> distinct gs could be identified and quantified by witzel and co-workers, with most of the aliphatic gs showing accession-specific distribution while the indole gs were present in almost all  <dig> accessions  <cit>  with one exception: ecotype wu- <dig> did not contain 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs in any tissue analyzed. since the corresponding whole genome sequences of all  <dig> accessions are available  <cit>  the respective sequence variants at locus at4g <dig>  were inspected for the presence of relevant polymorphisms. indeed, at bp coordinate  <dig> in the pseudo genome and bp coordinate  <dig> of the col- <dig> reference genome on chromosome  <dig> the insertion of one c nucleotide could be found solely in the accession wu- <dig>  this insertion produces a frame shift in the coding sequence thus disrupting cyp81f <dig> and leading to an altered protein sequence from amino acid  <dig> with a premature stop at amino acid  <dig>  in contrast, the putative functional protein is composed of  <dig> amino acids in all other accessions that produce 1-methoxy-indole-3-ylmethyl gs. in summary this is an excellent example were publicly available sequence data together with comprehensive metabolite profiling enables the identification of a gene that is putatively involved in the respective metabolic pathway at question. in addition, since the ecotype wu- <dig> is an arabidopsis accession collected from germany the presence of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs does not seem to be essential for survival of this ecotype in its natural habitat. as shown previously defense related co-expression networks in arabidopsis thaliana group together with tryptophan and gs biosynthesis genes in response to stress conditions  <cit> . thus, the increase of indole gs biosynthesis in arabidopsis and the relatively small accumulation of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs when compared to brassica rapa ssp. chinensis revealed that this specific indole gs might not play a pivotal role in stress response in arabidopsis thaliana.

characterization of the cyp81f <dig> genes identified in the brassica rapa genome
it was already shown that genes involved in the gs biosynthesis exist in more than one copy in the brassica rapa genome accession chiifu-401- <dig>  <cit> . besides this there is also a high co-linearity when compared to arabidopsis thaliana. this co-linearity is similarly found for atcyp81f <dig>  surrounded by atcyp81f <dig>  and atcyp81f <dig>  on arabidopsis chromosome  <dig>  when compared to arabidopsis at4g <dig> two different orthologues of the brassica rapa accession chiifu-401- <dig> on bac clones kbrb006j <dig> and kbrh064i <dig> could be identified: while kbrb006j <dig> corresponds to a region on chromosome a <dig>  no match for kbrh064i <dig> has been found so far. on kbrb006j <dig> the orthologue to atcyp81f <dig> was identified as bra <dig>  on the reverse strand on chromosome a <dig>  and is preceded by bra <dig> orthologous to atcyp81f <dig> and followed by bra <dig> orthologous to atcypf <dig>  on kbrh064i <dig> the orthologue to atcyp81f <dig> was named brcyp81f4- <dig>  and is preceded by another orthologue to atcyp81f <dig> while the following sequence orthologous to atcypf <dig> is corrupted.

in order to analyze the tissue specific expression of the selected genes in more detail isoform specific primer pairs were developed using the respective sequences of the brassica rapa accession chiifu-401- <dig> bac clones kbrb006j <dig> and kbrh064i <dig>  semi-quantitative realtime rt-pcr analysis was performed with cdna synthesized from rna isolated from 12 days old seedlings, and leaves and roots of six weeks old brassica rapa ssp. chinensis plants. as evident from table  <dig> expression of all selected genes could be detected in pak choi. in most cases a higher expression was found in leaves than in seedlings and only brcyp81f4- <dig> is expressed at a higher level in roots than in leaves. the highest expression level in leaves was detected for brcyp81f4- <dig> while brcyp81f4- <dig> was the main expressed isoform in roots. this already indicates that the brcyp81f <dig> isoforms may play an important role on a tissue-specific level and during development at standard growth conditions.

further expression analysis was performed with different tissues of pak choi treated with 500 μm meja. expression analysis confirmed induction of mainly the two identified brcyp81f <dig> genes in brassica rapa ssp. chinensis seedlings, leaves and roots treated with meja . since there was some increased expression also detectable for other isoforms seedlings of pak choi were treated with a series of different concentrations of meja and expression differences to control treatment were analyzed for all brcyp81f . this unequivocally confirms that both brcyp81f <dig> isoforms were most responsive to the elicitor treatment while the others did not show comparable sensitivity to this elicitor. application of 100 μm meja already elevated the expression of brcyp81f4- <dig> and brcyp81f4- <dig> 4fold with highest increase of brcyp81f4- <dig> of more than 64fold after application of 2 mm meja. this confirms that the two isoforms of brcyp81f <dig> are the candidate genes from brassica rapa ssp. chinensis that are crucial for 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs biosynthesis.

jasmonic acid signaling is a central component of inducible plant defense and the expression of jasmonate-induced responses are tightly regulated by the ecological background of the plant  <cit>  and also by the plant species itself. while in arabidopsis thaliana tryptophan and gs biosynthesis genes respond to stress conditions  <cit>  there is only relatively small accumulation of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs when compared to brassica rapa ssp. chinensis. the role of this distinct response to the elicitor and differences in accumulation of a specific defense compound will be the subject of future analysis in an ecological context.

functional identification of brcyp81f <dig> isoforms for biosynthesis of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs
in order to finally assess brcyp81f <dig> isoform function full length cdnas of both genes were amplified and heterologously expressed in the arabidopsis thaliana mutant atcyp81f <dig>  which does not produce 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs. using oligonucleotide primers developed with the brassica a genome sequence from brassica rapa accession chiifu-401- <dig>  <cit>  two full length cdna sequences from brassica rapa ssp. chinensis coding for putative brcyp81f <dig> isoforms were amplified. both sequences show  <dig> % pair-wise identities and code for proteins of  <dig> amino acids with 93% similarity. compared to the arabidopsis protein similarities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % could be calculated. the sequences of interest  were recombined into the plant expression vector pk7wg <dig>  <cit>  and agrobacterium mediated gene transfer was performed using the knock out mutant atcyp81f <dig> as the host. kanamycin resistant seedlings of the t <dig> generation were selected and analyzed for heterologous gene expression and gs accumulation. as shown in table  <dig> expression of both cdnas from pak choi in the atcyp81f <dig> mutant background led to metabolic complementation with accumulation of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs in leaves and a reduced level of i3m when compared to the mutant without expression of the brassica rapa ssp. chinensis genes. although the identical heterologous expression system was used, brcyp81f4- <dig> led to much higher accumulation of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl gs. whether this difference is caused by a higher protein level of the heterologous enzyme in the mutant plant background or is linked to advanced enzyme activity will be the topic of further studies. another interesting point here is the significant decrease of i3m in the atcyp81f <dig> mutant background when the highly active brcyp81f4- <dig> is expressed. in summary the level of indole gs stayed constant in these plants demonstrating unaltered total flux into the indole gs pathway thus indicating no further metabolic regulation by the end products.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion this is an explicit example were elicitation of a specific metabolic difference and subsequent comparative microarray analysis together with focused metabolite profiling permits the targeted discovery of genes involved in the respective metabolic pathway. here this enables the functional attribution of new identified brassica rapa ssp. chinensis genes to their metabolic role in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis that in the near future will contribute to develop new genetic tools for breeding vegetables with improved glucosinolate profile.
