BACKGROUND
ras proteins have been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis and senescence  <cit> . ras proteins are small gtp-binding proteins that switch between inactive guanosine diphosphate -bound and active guanosine triphosphate -bound conformations  <cit> . active gtp-bound ras recruits raf to the cell membrane. raf then phosphorylates mitogen-activated and extracellular-signal regulated kinase kinases  which in turn, phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinases . erks activate cytoplasmic substrates and translocate to the nucleus to stimulate expression of immediate early genes such as c-jun and e <dig> transcription factors   <cit> . the ras-raf-erk signaling pathway has been shown to be sufficient for transformation of murine cell lines  <cit> .

activating somatic missense mutations in ras genes  have been found in a number of human cancers  <cit> . specific associations have been found between the three major ras oncogenes, h-, k- and n-ras, and specific types of malignancies  <cit> . for instance, k-ras mutations are frequent in pancreatic and colon carcinomas, h-ras mutations in bladder cancers and n-ras mutations in melanomas and small intestine malignancies  <cit> . in addition, germline mutations in ras underlie several developmental disorders including cardio-facio cutaneous syndrome , costello  and noonan syndromes  that are characterized by sporadic tumors and skeletal, cardiac and visual abnormalities  <cit> . the reasons for the association of specific ras genes with specific tumors or developmental disorders are not well understood.

analysis of h-, k- and n-ras null mice suggests that ras proteins perform both unique and overlapping roles during development. h-ras and n-ras single and double null mice are viable, fertile and develop normally  <cit> . of the two k-ras isoforms, 4a and 4b, 4b but not 4a is essential for embryogenesis  <cit> . k-ras 4b null embryos die in utero due to anemia, liver and cardiac defects  <cit> . replacement of k-ras coding sequences with h-ras results in viable mice  <cit>  suggesting that h-ras protein can perform the functions of k-ras in k-ras-expressing tissues presumably by activating the same set of downstream targets. alterations in ocular development in k-ras null mice have not been reported.

lens differentiation is initiated when the neuroectoderm-derived optic vesicle induces the overlying surface ectoderm to upregulate the expression of transcription factors such as pax <dig> and sox <dig>  leading to lens placode formation . the lens placode then invaginates to form a distinctively shaped, symmetrical lens pit. bmp receptor mediated signaling has recently been shown to be critical for this placodal invagination  <cit> . the lens cells subsequently detach from the overlying ectoderm to form the lens vesicle. lens detachment requires the transcription factors foxe <dig> and pitx <dig>  <cit> . during vesicle closure, the posterior cells of the lens vesicle initiate fiber cell differentiation, forming the primary fiber cells. fiber cells exit from the cell cycle, undergo dramatic elongation, and express β- and γ-crystallins. the anterior cells of the lens remain cuboidal and retain expression of pax <dig> and e-cadherin  <cit> . the anterior-posterior polarity of the lens is maintained throughout life by coordination of lens epithelial proliferation, cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation. upregulation of the transcription factor prox <dig> at the transition zone near the equator has been shown to be essential for cell cycle exit  <cit> . the cdk inhibitors p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> are upregulated at the transition zone and are necessary for proper cell cycle exit at the outset of fiber cell differentiation  <cit> . an inductive signal from the neural retina is critical for initiation of lens fiber differentiation  <cit> . though the identity of this inductive signal is not known, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that this signal is an fgf or fgf-like molecule  <cit> . expression of a secreted dominant negative version of the fgfr <dig> or targeted deletion of fgfr <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the lens results in the delay or loss of fiber cell differentiation  <cit> . these results suggest that fgf receptor mediated signaling is necessary for initiation of lens fiber differentiation.

after lens vesicle detachment, surface epithelial cells adjacent to the lens vesicle differentiate to form the corneal epithelium. in mice, corneal epithelial differentiation is marked by keratin  <dig>  expression  <cit> . the corneal stroma and endothelium are formed by intraocular migration of neural crest and mesodermally-derived periocular mesenchymal cells  <cit> .

previous studies showed that activation of the fibroblast growth factor  signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in transgenic mice leads to cell cycle exit and premature fiber differentiation  <cit> . in contrast, fgf signaling induces the corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal or harderian glands  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms that regulate proliferative and differentiation responses of the cornea and lens respectively have not been defined.

activation of ras, a downstream effector of fgf signaling, in the lenses of transgenic mice is sufficient to induce lens epithelial hyperplasia  <cit> . in addition, h-, k- and n-ras genes are expressed ubiquitously within the eye  <cit> . however, in previous studies, downstream targets of ras activation in the lens were not analyzed. in addition, the promoter used to drive ras expression in the eye was lens-specific thereby precluding analysis of the effects of ras activation in the cornea.

in order to test whether activation of ras in the cornea can phenocopy the effects of fgf signaling, we generated transgenic mice that express a constitutively active version of h-ras  driven by a modified pax <dig> promoter  <cit>  this promoter is active in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. our results suggest that, despite the common embryonic origin of the lens and the cornea, these two tissues possess distinct sets of downstream targets that regulate the cellular responses to ras activation.

methods
generation of ras transgenic mice
the human h-ras  genomic clone, encoding a constitutively active version of h-ras , was digested with spei and inserted between the pax <dig> promoter/enhancer and the sv <dig> intron and polyadenylation sequences  <cit> . the injection fragment was generated by spei and stui digestion and was microinjected into individual pronuclei of 1-cell stage fvb/n mouse embryos. injected embryos were transferred into pseudopregnant icr strain female mice. animals were handled following the guidelines provided in us public health service policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals. the embryos were allowed to develop to term and potential pax6-ras transgenic mice were identified by isolating genomic dna from tail biopsies and screening by pcr, using primers specific for the sv <dig> sequences  <cit> .

histological analyses
embryos were obtained by mating fvb/n females to heterozygous ras transgenic males. pregnant females were sacrificed at appropriate time points and transgenic offspring were identified by pcr. heads of transgenic mice were removed, fixed in 10% formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned  and used for histological analyses, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

in situ hybridization
to analyze patterns of gene expression,  utp-labeled riboprobes were generated. the sv <dig> antisense riboprobe was synthesized using ecori-digested sv <dig> dna and t <dig> rna polymerase . the foxe <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using hindiii-digested mouse foxe <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the pitx <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using xhoi-digested mouse pitx <dig> cdna and sp <dig> rna polymerase. the prox <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using smai-digested mouse prox <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the p57kip <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using bamhi-digested mouse p57kip <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the erm, pea <dig>  spry <dig> and spry <dig> antisense probes were synthesized using ecori-digested erm, pea <dig>  spry <dig> and spry <dig> cdnas and t <dig> rna polymerase. the spry <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using saci-digested mouse spry <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the cyclin d <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using xhoi-digested mouse cyclin d <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the cyclin d <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using sphi-digested mouse cyclin d <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the cyclin b <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using hincii-digested mouse cyclin b <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the p21cip <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using apai-digested mouse p21cip <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. the hes <dig> antisense probe was synthesized using hindiii-digested mouse hes <dig> cdna and t <dig> rna polymerase. in situ hybridizations were performed using the same hybridization and washing conditions as described previously  <cit> . the hybridized slides were soaked in kodak ntb- <dig> emulsion, dried and exposed for 4- <dig> days at 4°c. following development and fixation, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. bright and dark-field images were captured separately using a nikon eclipse e <dig> microscope. silver grains in the dark field images were pseudo-colored red using adobe photoshop cs and overlaid on corresponding bright field images.

immunohistochemistry
immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed as follows. slides containing ocular sections were first deparaffinized and rehydrated. antigens were retrieved by microwave treatment in  <dig> mm sodium citrate buffer . following antigen retrieval, the tissue sections were blocked with 10% normal horse serum for  <dig> minutes, at room temperature. the slides were then incubated with anti-pax <dig> , anti-e-cadherin , anti-keratin  <dig>  , anti-prox <dig> , anti-α a crystallin , anti-β crystallin , anti-keratin  <dig>  , anti-phospho erk1/ <dig> , anti-p57kip <dig> , anti-14-3-3σ , anti-ki <dig>  or anti-trp <dig>   antibody overnight at 4°c. following brief washes in pbs, the slides were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated-secondary antibodies; anti-rabbit igg  for pax <dig>  prox <dig>  α a-crystallin, β-crystallin, phospho-erk1/ <dig>  p57kip <dig>  krt <dig> or krt <dig>  anti-mouse igg  for e-cadherin or trp <dig>  anti-goat igg  for 14-3-3σ and anti-rat igg  for ki <dig> for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. antigen-antibody complexes were then detected using streptavidin-linked alexa  <dig>  at 1: <dig> dilution. sections were mounted using prolong antifade media containing dapi . images were captured using a nikon eclipse e <dig> microscope.

proliferation assay
dna replication was examined by brdu incorporation as described previously  <cit> . cell proliferation was analyzed by counting the number of brdu positive nuclei. quantification of cell proliferation  was performed by determining the fraction of brdu labeled nuclei over the total number of nuclei present on a given section. cells in the interior of the pax6-ras transgenic lenses that expressed markers such as foxe <dig> and prox <dig> were counted as lens cells. a minimum of  <dig> different embryos were analyzed per genotype/time point. the number of sections used for quantification is indicated in the graphs . analysis was performed by two-tailed student's t-test at p ≤  <dig> .

RESULTS
in order to test whether activation of ras, a downstream effector of fgf signaling, can mimic the effects of fgf stimulation on the lens and cornea in the murine eye, we generated transgenic mice with targeted expression of a constitutively active  version of human h-ras under the control of the pax <dig> promoter . this promoter is active from embryonic day  <dig>   in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial precursors  <cit> . the pax6-ras transgene was constructed by inserting the human h-ras gene  between the pax <dig> enhancer/promoter and sv <dig> intron and polyadenylation site. the transgene was microinjected and two founders were generated. stable transgenic lines  were established from these founders. transgenic line ove <dig> did not show any ocular abnormalities. ove <dig> mice showed microphthalmia and were born with open eyelids.

transgene expression
transgene expression in the two pax6-ras transgenic lines was examined by in situ hybridizations . no transgene expression was seen in the ove <dig> line . in the ove <dig> line, at e <dig>  and e <dig> , transgene expression could be seen in the lens, corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells . low levels of ras transgene expression were seen in a subset of neuroblasts in the retina at e <dig>   with stronger expression at e <dig>  . as transgene expression was seen only in the ove <dig> transgenic line, further studies were performed on this line and the results are presented here. in this manuscript we study the initial changes in lens and corneal differentiation. later changes in retinal organization are not evaluated in this report.

ras transgenic mice show altered lens and corneal development
in order to assess the alterations in ocular development and morphology, sections of pax6-ras transgenic mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. at e <dig> , the lens placode had invaginated to form the lens pit . in the ras transgenic embryos, morphological changes at the anterior margin of the lens pit were visible . the boundary between the surface and lens pit epithelial cells was well defined in the nontransgenic embryos . in contrast, in the transgenic embryos, extra cells extending into the interior of the lens pit were seen . at e <dig> , ras transgenic lenses and corneas displayed epithelial hyperplasia . in addition, the extra cells seen in the lens pit were internalized within the lumen of the developing lens. . by e <dig> , ras transgenic lenses had become embedded in the cornea . at e <dig> , the eyelids had failed to close in the ras transgenic embryos . in addition, lenses remained attached to the cornea and the lens epithelial cells showed an elongated morphology  in contrast to the cuboidal morphology in the lens epithelial cells of nontransgenic embryos . the corneal stroma was disorganized and a distinctive corneal endothelium was not seen . at e <dig> , vacuoles were present inside the defective lens  and the central cornea showed epithelial and stromal defects .

increased apoptosis in ras transgenic lenses
in order to assess apoptosis in ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells, we examined cleavage of caspase- <dig>  a critical mediator of apoptosis, by immunohistochemistry . activated caspase  <dig> was detected in the transgenic epithelial cells within the lens that were not in contact with the basement membrane . positive staining was not seen in the lens epithelial cells that expressed the ras transgene but retained contact with the basement membrane. similarly, activated caspase  <dig> staining, for the most part, was not seen in the ras transgenic corneas .

increase in proliferation of ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells
in order to assess cell proliferation in the ras transgenic embryos, brdu incorporation assays and ki <dig> immunohistochemistry were performed . the brdu incorporation assay allows the identification of cells in s phase of the cell cycle. ki <dig> is expressed by cycling cells in g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m phase but not g <dig> cells. ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in brdu labeling at e <dig>  . the cells in the interior part of the lens vesicle that were not in contact with the basement membrane also incorporated brdu . at e <dig> , a significant increase in the brdu labeling index of corneal, but not lens, epithelial cells was seen . both brdu  and ki <dig>  assays showed consistent results. thus, ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show a significant increase in proliferation initially but later, this increase is sustained in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells. alterations in conjunctival epithelial proliferation will be described elsewhere .

altered lens differentiation in ras transgenic mice
alterations in the lens differentiation program were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . pax <dig>  foxe <dig>  prox <dig> and pitx <dig> are transcription factors that are critical for lens specification , lens vesicle detachment  and cell cycle exit of lens epithelial cells   <cit> . in nontransgenic lenses, pax <dig>  e-cadherin and foxe <dig> are expressed in the epithelial cells , β-crystallin in differentiated fiber cells  and prox <dig> and α-crystallin in both epithelial and fiber cells . expression of pax <dig> , foxe <dig>  and pitx <dig>  in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was similar to nontransgenic lenses . e-cadherin expression in the transgenic lens epithelial cells was comparable, although perhaps not identical, to nontransgenic lenses . prox <dig> expression is normally upregulated near the equator of the lens where the fiber differentiation is initiated . in contrast, prox <dig> was upregulated in the ras transgenic lens epithelial cells  but expression in the fiber cells was similar to wild type controls . expression of α-crystallin in the transgenic lens epithelial cells  and β-crystallins in the transgenic lens fiber cells were similar to nontransgenic controls . the extra cells in the interior part of the ras transgenic lenses that were not in contact with the basement membrane expressed lens epithelial markers including foxe <dig> , pitx <dig>  and α-crystallin . in addition, in a subset of these cells, expression of prox <dig>  and β-crystallin  could be detected. double labeling with β-crystallin and e-cadherin antibodies suggested co-localization of these two proteins in some of the abnormal epithelial cells . these results show that some markers of lens fiber differentiation are induced in the anterior cells of the transgenic lenses.

erk activation in ras transgenic lenses and corneas
erk activation in the ras transgenic lenses and corneas was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-phospho erk1/ <dig> antibody . erk <dig> and  <dig> are phosphorylated in response to ras activation  <cit> . phospho-erk1/ <dig> immunoreactivity could be detected in the lens fiber cells of e <dig>  and e <dig>  nontransgenic embryos . elevated levels of phospho-erk1/ <dig> were detected in the ras transgenic lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells . in addition, a modest reduction of phospho-erk1/ <dig> levels was seen in the ras transgenic lens fiber cells at e <dig>  . these results show that the lens and the corneal epithelial cells show differential erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in response to ras activation.

ras targets in the lens and cornea
in order to test whether ras activation can induce expression of ets transcription factors  or negative feedback regulators of ras-raf-erk signaling , in the lens and corneas, in situ hybridizations were performed on e <dig>  ocular sections of ras transgenic embryos . erm, pea <dig>  spry <dig> and  <dig> were upregulated in the ras transgenic corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells  in contrast to nontransgenic corneas . significant upregulation of erm, but not pea <dig>  spry <dig> or  <dig>  expression was seen in the ras transgenic lens epithelial cells . spry  <dig> was not induced in the transgenic lens or cornea . expression of erm, spry <dig> and  <dig> in the ras transgenic lens fiber cells was similar to nontransgenic controls . in summary, different sets of downstream targets were activated in the ras transgenic lens and corneal epithelial cells.

cell cycle targets of ras in the lens and cornea
expression of genes that regulate the cell cycle was analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . d-type cyclins are often activated in response to growth factor and/or ras stimulation and can promote entry into s phase  <cit> . p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> have been shown to regulate cell cycle exit during fiber cell induction  <cit> . upregulation of cyclins d <dig> and d <dig> was seen in the ras lens and corneal epithelial cells . cyclin b <dig> was upregulated in the transgenic corneal epithelial cells  but expression in the lenses was similar to nontransgenic controls . no alterations in cyclin e expression were seen in ras transgenic lenses and corneas . p21cip <dig> expression was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells . expression of p57kip <dig> is normally upregulated near the equator where the lens epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and initiate fiber differentiation . p57kip <dig> mrna and p57kip <dig> protein levels were upregulated in ras transgenic lens epithelial cells . similarly, p27kip <dig> mrna levels were elevated in the transgenic lens but not corneal epithelial cells . in summary, d-type cyclins were elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells but b-type cyclins were elevated only in the corneal epithelial cells. cdk inhibitors p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> were preferentially upregulated in the lens but not in the corneal epithelial cells. in contrast, p21cip <dig> was upregulated in both epithelial cell types.

altered corneal differentiation in ras transgenic mice
alterations in corneal differentiation in the ras transgenic corneas were assessed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry . hes <dig>  a transcription factor and a downstream target of the notch signaling pathway, is modestly expressed in the corneal epithelial cells  and has been shown to be critical for maintenance of the corneal progenitor/stem cells  <cit> . keratin  <dig>  expression is restricted to the corneal epithelial cells within the eye  and has been shown to be essential for corneal differentiation  <cit> . krt <dig>  14-3-3σ and trp <dig> are expressed in the corneal, conjunctival and skin epithelia . at e <dig> , hes <dig> expression was expanded in the ras transgenic corneas but was unaltered in the ras transgenic lenses . at e <dig> , krt <dig> expression was significantly reduced in the ras transgenic corneas  but krt <dig>  14-3-3σ and trp <dig> were still expressed . reduction in krt <dig> expression indicates that terminal differentiation of corneal epithelial cells is inhibited by expression of activated ras.

discussion
the pax6-ras transgenic mice were generated in order to test whether ras activation in the corneal and lens epithelial cells can phenocopy the effects of fgf stimulation. similar studies performed on embryonic retinal pigmented epithelial  cells in transgenic mice suggest that ras activation can mimic the effects of fgf stimulation and is sufficient to induce the rpe cells to initiate a neuronal program of differentiation  <cit> . lens-specific expression of fgf <dig> in transgenic mice stimulates corneal epithelial cells to first proliferate and later differentiate into lacrimal and harderian glands. our results suggest that ras activation is sufficient to induce proliferation but not glandular differentiation of corneal epithelial cells. ras transgenic lenticular and corneal epithelial cells show increased proliferation with concomitant increases in cyclin d <dig> and d <dig> expression. the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip <dig> was upregulated in both the lens and corneal epithelia. the initial increase in lens epithelial proliferation was not sustained perhaps due to the upregulation of p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig>  phospho-erk <dig> and erk <dig> levels are elevated in the lens but not in the cornea. consistent with this result, expression of sprys <dig> and  <dig>  downstream targets of fgf signaling and negative feedback regulators of ras-raf-erk pathway, was higher in the ras transgenic corneal than in the lens epithelial cells. pea <dig>  an ets transcription factor, was elevated in the corneal but not in the lens epithelial cells. in contrast, transcription of erm, another ets transcription factor, was elevated in both the lens and corneal epithelial cells. both lens and corneal differentiation programs were sensitive to ras activation. ras transgenic lenses showed defects in morphogenesis at the lens pit stage. transgenic lens epithelial cells showed upregulation of prox <dig>  a transcription factor critical for cell cycle exit and initiation of fiber differentiation. keratin  <dig>  a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, was significantly reduced in the ras transgenic corneas. collectively, these results show that a) lens and corneal epithelial growth and differentiation are sensitive to alterations in ras activity and b) ras activation can induce distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea.

in our transgenic model, the h-ras protein is constitutively active and not subject to feedback regulation. it is therefore, possible  that ras activity is significantly higher than normal. upregulation of p21cip <dig>  in the ras transgenic lenses and corneas would be consistent with this possibility. nonetheless, our results show that constitutive ras signaling is not sufficient to induce glandular differentiation in the cornea. as early molecular markers of lacrimal or harderian gland differentiation are not currently known, initiation of glandular differentiation in the ras corneal epithelial cells could not be analyzed. our results imply that other signaling pathways downstream of fgf receptor stimulation are necessary for ocular gland differentiation. ras activation, however, is sufficient to induce an increase in corneal epithelial proliferation. similarly, lens epithelial cells also respond to ras activation by hyperproliferaton. ras activation in the lens and corneal epithelial cells induces transcriptional upregulation of cyclins d <dig> and d <dig>  as cyclin e was not induced in these tissues, it is likely that ras-induced entry into s phase  is due to the upregulation of cyclins d <dig> and d <dig> 

cdk inhibitors, p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig>  are normally upregulated in the transition zone of the lens where the fiber differentiation program is initiated. both p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> cooperatively regulate cell cycle exit at the onset of fiber cell differentiation  <cit> . ras activation in the lenticular, but not the corneal, epithelial cells upregulated both p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig>  in addition, the initial increase in proliferation seen at e <dig>  in the lens epithelial cells was not sustained at e <dig>  in contrast to corneal epithelial cells of the same age. these results taken together suggest that the deceleration in lens epithelial proliferation at e <dig>  could be due to induction of cdk inhibitors p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> in the lens. the reasons for specific upregulation of these genes in the lens but not in the cornea are not clear. however, expression of the transcription factor, prox <dig>  offers us a clue. the transcription factor prox <dig> has been shown to be necessary for transcriptional upregulation of p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> in the lens as expression of these two genes is not seen in prox <dig> null lenses  <cit> . in lymphatic vascular endothelial cells prox <dig> expression is sufficient to activate p57kip <dig> expression and to promote cell cycle exit  <cit> . these studies considered together would suggest that transcriptional upregulation of p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig> in ras transgenic lenses could be due to ras-induced upregulation of prox <dig>  it is not clear why ras-induced upregulation of prox <dig> is specific to the lens but not the cornea.

ras transgenic lenses also showed increased apoptosis. apoptosis, however, was not seen in all the lens cells that expressed the ras transgene suggesting that apoptosis was not a non-specific consequence of ras transgene expression. apoptosis in the lens was seen only in the abnormal cells in the interior of the lens. these results are interesting as oncogenic ras has been shown to block suspension induced apoptosis or anoikis in vitro  <cit> . ras is able to protect cells from anoikis through the activation of akt via pi <dig> kinase  <cit> . whether the pi <dig> kinase-akt pathway is inactive in the ras transgenic lenses remain to be verified.

in the ras transgenic mice, early events during lens differentiation including lens placode formation and lens invagination were not affected. however, ras transgenic lenses failed to form a normal lens pit resulting in architectural changes at the lens pit stage. we considered the possibility that the altered lens pit architecture is caused by loss of foxe <dig> or pitx <dig> expression as foxe <dig> and pitx <dig> mutants show persistence of a lens stalk  <cit> . however, expression of both foxe <dig> and pitx <dig> were unaltered in ras transgenic lenses. we also analyzed the expression of e-cadherin, a cell adhesion protein that plays a role in lens invagination  <cit> . e-cadherin was still expressed in the ras transgenic lenses. it seems likely that the alterations in the architecture of the lens pit are a consequence of altered proliferation of cells in or around the lens placode in response to ras stimulation. if this is true, it suggests that cell proliferation and invagination have to be precisely coordinated during lens invagination.

previous studies have shown that activation of the fgf signaling pathway in the lens epithelial cells in vivo is sufficient for induction of fiber differentiation  <cit> . in vitro experiments using rat lens epithelial explants have shown that fgfs at low concentration, can induce proliferation and at high concentration, can induce cell cycle exit and differentiation  <cit> . our results suggest that ras activation in the lens epithelial cells induces a modest increase in cell proliferation, at least transiently. concurrently, there is upregulation of expression of some of the early markers of lens differentiation such as prox <dig>  p27kip <dig> and p57kip <dig>  however, β-crystallin, a marker of terminal differentiation of lens fibers, was detected in only a small fraction of the ras transgenic lens epithelial cells. some of these cells also expressed lens epithelial markers including pax <dig> and e-cadherin, suggesting an abnormal or ambiguous state of differentiation. these results suggest that ras activation is sufficient to initiate only limited aspects of the lens fiber differentiation program. these results are consistent with previous reports that show erk signaling, while necessary for fgf-induced lens fiber elongation, is not sufficient for β-crystallin expression  <cit> .

both corneal and lens epithelial cells originate from the surface ectoderm. interestingly, our results suggest that, in spite of their common embryonic origin, the lens and the cornea activate distinctive sets of downstream targets in response to ras activation. phospho-erk levels were elevated in the ras transgenic lens but not in the cornea. in addition, negative feedback regulators of raf-erk signaling such as spry <dig> and spry <dig> are elevated more in the cornea than in the lens epithelial cells. these observations provide correlative evidence that spry <dig> and  <dig> may be inhibiting raf-erk signaling in the corneal epithelial cells. alternatively, it is possible that signaling effectors downstream of ras that are critical for erk phosphorylation are expressed in the lens more than in the cornea. this model would predict that ras-induced expression of downstream targets in the cornea is independent of erk activation and that ras signals through other effectors. transcription factors that show tissue-specific expression such as trp <dig> in the cornea or prox <dig> in the lens may also dictate the response of these tissues to ras signaling. nonetheless, the differential activation of downstream targets in these two related tissues is a novel discovery that warrants further analysis.

our results suggest that corneal differentiation is sensitive to changes in ras activity. interestingly, in contrast to the lens, ras stimulation inhibits corneal epithelial differentiation. expression of krt <dig>  a marker of corneal epithelial differentiation, is significantly reduced. expansion of the expression domain of hes <dig>  a gene critical for maintenance of pleuripotency  <cit> , is consistent with the block in differentiation. expression of other proteins such as 14-3-3σ, krt <dig> and trp <dig> that are normally expressed in, but not restricted to, the corneal epithelium was maintained. therefore, it is likely that the inhibition of krt <dig> expression in the ras transgenic corneas is a specific effect of ras stimulation.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results suggest that ras activation induces distinct sets of downstream targets in the lens and cornea resulting in distinct cellular responses. these results support the model that responses to ras signaling are tissue specific and dictated by the autonomous programming of the responding tissues. these results also suggest the possibility that the associations seen between mutations in specific ras genes and specific types of malignancies could be explained at least in part, by cell-specific activation of different signaling effectors and downstream targets.
