BACKGROUND
wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member  <dig>  is a locally acting signalling molecule, regulating cell-cell interactions, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and gene activation  <cit> . it is a highly conserved gene within mammals and has multiple roles in organogenesis and homeostasis and is of special interest in the sexual differentiation of the ovary  <cit> . while it can elicit its effects through the "canonical" wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway  <cit> , it mainly acts through "non-canonical" signalling pathways. the wnt <dig> signalling pathway is mediated by the factor c-jun n-terminal kinase  in both the frog eye and human kidney development  <cit> . while wnt <dig> function is well defined, the underlying mechanisms that regulate its expression are still largely unknown.

marsupials are mammals that diverged from the eutherian mammal lineage around  <dig> million years ago. marsupials differ from other mammals in subtle ways especially in their mode of reproduction  <cit> . we use the tammar wallaby as the model marsupial because most sexual differentiation occurs after birth, unlike in eutherian mammals where differentiation of the testis and ovary occurs in utero  <cit> . we now know that wnt <dig> appears to be as important in differentiation of the marsupial ovary as it is in eutherians  <cit> , suggesting that this gene has been highly conserved during therian  evolution. despite its importance as a developmental regulator, the regulation of wnt <dig> has not been clearly defined. it is hard to distinguish functional from non-functional sequences in the promoter region by comparing closely related species such as mouse and human. it was therefore of interest to examine the promoter region of this important gene in representatives of the two therian mammal groups that diverged over  <dig> million years ago.

initiation of transcription is the primary mechanism by which genes are regulated and is dependent on the structure of the promoter region and the corresponding transcription factor binding sites. there has been some analysis of the wnt <dig> promoter region. the human wnt <dig> immediate 5'-flanking region  has promoter activity, but the critical promoter elements have not yet been defined  <cit> . although wt <dig> down-regulates wnt <dig> gene expression in vitro, no active wt <dig> binding sites have been identified in the  <dig>  kb promoter region by reporter analysis  <cit> . p <dig> is a negative transcriptional regulator of wnt <dig> expression in keratinocyte growth control  <cit> . furthermore, p <dig> binding to the wnt <dig> promoter is mediated through the transcriptional factor e2f- <dig>  <cit> , and there is an e2f- <dig> binding site near the tata box-proximal region of the mouse wnt <dig> promoter  <cit> . in gonadal development, fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and wnt <dig> appear to act as antagonistic signals to regulate mammalian sexual differentiation  <cit> . in mouse kidney development, the transcriptional factor pax <dig> activates wnt <dig> expression in vitro and in vivo, and also directly activates human wnt <dig> promoter activity  <cit> . furthermore, there are three pax <dig> recognition motifs in the 5'-flanking sequence of the human wnt <dig> gene  <cit>  but the precise pathway of transcriptional regulation of wnt <dig> gene in renal development is still unclear. there is a novel response element  in the human wnt <dig> promoter that confers p63- and p73-specific activation  <cit> . together, these studies contribute to our understanding of wnt <dig> transcriptional regulation mechanisms, but how transcriptional modulation and chromatin structure remodelling are controlled by the promoter is still poorly understood and as yet there is no complete analysis of the wnt <dig> promoter.

comparative genomics is a powerful way to identify conserved elements of genes and promoter regions likely to be essential for their function  <cit> . selecting suitable species is the key for evolutionary comparisons. if closely related species are selected, it is very hard to distinguish the random sequences from the functional sequences. marsupials provide an ideal model for the identification of conserved mammalian gene features since they diverged from mice and humans over  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . elements conserved between mice and humans  and the tammar wallaby  over this long period of divergent evolution are therefore likely to be critical to their function.

this is the first study of the wnt <dig> promoter in any non-eutherian mammal. we used comparative genomics to isolate conserved mammalian promoter elements, and examined their function in promoter construct assays in both tammar primary cell lines as well as human cell lines. this has enabled identification of the conserved elements of the promoter and transcriptional factor binding sites  likely to be essential in the regulation of wnt <dig>  we have also analysed the human wnt <dig> promoter in these cell lines and compared their activities to further define the function of this region.

RESULTS
cloning of tammar and human wnt <dig> 5' flanking sequence
since there were no ecori restriction enzyme sites identified in the tammar wallaby wnt <dig> cdna sequence, this enzyme was used to create a shotgun library of a wnt <dig> containing tammar bac clone   <cit>  in pbluescript ii sk  vector. resulting clones were pcr screened for the presence of exon  <dig>  one clone was identified with a  <dig>  kb insert and sequence analysis confirmed that it contained about  <dig> kb upstream of the tammar wnt <dig> gene. the transcription start site was determined according to our previous analysis of the tammar wnt <dig> gene  <cit>  and all of transcripts/isoforms were obtained with the same untranslated region . the human wnt <dig> 5' upstream sequence was retrieved from the ensembl database . primers  were designed to amplify the orthologous  <dig> kb dna fragment and smaller regions from human genomic dna. primers  were engineered to contain either acc65i or xhoi restriction sites to enable cloning into the pgl <dig>  reporter construct. a high gc content pcr kit was used to obtain the fragments due to the abnormally high gc content of these regions .

p: promoter; h: human; t: tammar; f: forward primer; r: reverse primer; d: deletion

comparative analysis of the wnt <dig> upstream and downstream genomic sequences
sequences from the tammar, opossum , human and mouse were aligned using mulan  to investigate the conservation of the wnt <dig> promoter region. analysis was performed over an approximately  <dig> kb region from each species, consisting of  <dig> kb of upstream and  <dig> kb of downstream of wnt <dig> exon  <dig>  due to gaps in the genome assembly, only  <dig>  kb of sequence was available for the opossum downstream of exon  <dig>  the analysis identified three clearly conserved regions, one covering exon  <dig> as predicted, but another was found in the immediate 5' region and one other in intron  <dig> .

identification of the conserved wnt <dig> promoter region
to further explore the conservation of the human and tammar wnt <dig> promoter, we compared minimal promoter sequences  with the genomatix program dialign tf  . we identified a highly conserved transcriptional module  that contains multiple tfbs including zbp , sp <dig> , egr , nfκb , pax <dig> , pax <dig> , ap <dig>  and eklf  . there are also three other highly conserved tfbs, outside of this region, two for myod  and one for sp <dig>  we also investigated the conservation of motifs in the distal 5' flanking regions from tammar, human and mouse . we have identified four conserved motifs ; motif  <dig> , motif  <dig> , motif  <dig>  and motif  <dig> .

we did not identify a tata box immediately 5' of the transcription start site and no ccaat sequence was identified in the proximal promoter region. however, very high gc content and cpg islands are conserved features of this region .

functional analysis of the wnt <dig> promoter region
before examination of promoter function, wnt <dig> expression was confirmed in the primary cell lines. the primary cell lines used for analyses were derived from neonatal tammar wallaby lung and kidney, and an established human embryonic kidney cell line . primers  spanning introns confirmed the expression of wnt <dig> in all cell lines .

deletion analysis of the putative promoter was used to uncover the regions necessary for the transcriptional activity in kidney and lung cell lines. 5' upstream fragments were fused to a luciferase reporter vector . the promoter-luc <dig> constructs and basic vector pgl <dig>  were then used to transfect three different cell lines, human hek293t cells and tammar lung and kidney cells . fragments are described in bp either side of the start codon.

maximum promoter activity was found in the tammar -530/+ <dig> fragment within tammar kidney primary cell lines and human hek293t kidney cell lines. smaller constructs  showed very low promoter activity in the above two cell lines. larger fragments , had reduced activity, indicative of transcriptional repressors present further 5' in the promoter region. transcriptional inhibitor binding sites appeared to be present in the -2753/- <dig> regions of the tammar promoter because the transcriptional activity was lower in these longer regions in all three different cell lines and much lower than in the -530/+ <dig>  and -980/+ <dig>  regions. however, in the tammar lung primary cell line, the -980/+ <dig> showed the highest promoter activity, above that of the -530/+ <dig> fragment from kidney. this suggests that important lung cell tfbs are likely to be located within this region  to increase gene function by protein-dna or protein-protein interactions. noticeably, we also found that the fragment -229/+ <dig> has almost double the activity compared to "no insert" control in the tammar lung primary cell lines, suggesting the different cellular context is very important for activation of gene transcription. in addition, minimal promoter refers to the shortest fragment that can drive the gene initiation or expression. taken together, these data suggest that the tammar wnt <dig> minimal promoter region lies in the -530/+ <dig> region in vitro.

these findings are consistent with previous analyses, which suggest that the human wnt <dig> promoter is located in the -781/+ <dig> fragment and larger fragments  showed reduced promoter activity suggesting negative regulator binding sites within this region  <cit> . furthermore, the immediate 5' region  also had no promoter activity. interestingly, we also found that human promoter constructs had higher relative expression in tammar cell lines than the corresponding tammar promoter constructs. this may be due to subtle differences in the regions covered by fragments derived from each species for analysis. however, while the activities of promoters were variable between species, both marsupial and human promoter regions show similar trends between comparable promoter regions.

chromosome mapping
the chromosomal location of tammar wnt <dig> gene was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization to metaphase plates. wnt <dig> is autosomal, as in all other mammals  and is on the long arm of tammar chromosome  <dig> . primate wnt <dig>  including human  <cit> , chimp and macaque is on chromosome  <dig>  whereas wnt <dig> of cow and dog is on chromosome  <dig> 

note: the chromosome localizations of wnt <dig> gene in chimp, macaque, cow, dog, mouse, rat, opossum, chicken, zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon and stickleback were assigned according to homepage of ensembl  or ncbi , and platypus wnt <dig> was localized by grafodatskaya et al  <cit> .

discussion
wnt <dig> is an essential gene in embryogenesis, critical for the development of kidney, adrenal, gonad, mammary gland and eye  <cit> . despite its many functions, the transcriptional regulation of the wnt <dig> gene remains poorly characterised. in this comparative analysis of the mammalian wnt <dig> promoter, we have refined the promoter and identified evolutionarily conserved tfbs that appear to be important for wnt <dig> transcriptional regulation in kidney and lung, in all mammals including man. since these regions have been conserved in sequence and function for over  <dig> million years  <cit> , they are likely to represent promoter and enhancer regions critical for mammalian wnt <dig> gene regulation.

we found several conserved putative tfbs in both the human and tammar promoter regions. these were mainly conserved within an  <dig> bp transcription module, designated as tf module i, which shared a 97% identity between human and tammar . we also identified a conserved myod-sp1-myod transcription module between module i and the transcription start site , which could have a central role in transcriptional regulation. sp <dig> is one of the first eukaryotic transcription factors to stimulate or repress transcription by binding/competing to the gc/gt elements or recruiting chromatin remodelers  <cit> . except for the  <dig> common sp <dig> binding sites shared across species, the tammar has an additional  <dig> and human an additional  <dig> sp <dig> binding sites predicted between the tss and tf module i . sp <dig> therefore could have an essential role in initiation of wnt <dig> gene expression. we found a conserved binding site for the zinc finger binding protein , a transcriptional regulator involved in cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . a conserved nuclear factor κb  binding site was also found in tf module i. nfκb regulates target genes at several levels including controlled cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling and modulation of transcriptional activity  <cit> . we also identified pax <dig> and pax <dig> tfbs in the tf module i. interestingly, pax <dig> has been shown to bind to the wnt <dig> promoter and activate its expression during the kidney development  <cit> . however, this motif does not appear to be conserved in the tammar core promoter. the sequence about  <dig>  kb upstream of the transcriptional start site in the human promoter had homology to both the consensus pax <dig> motif proposed by brophy et al.,  <cit>  and to the pax <dig> motif predicated by matinspector software  <cit> . there is some crossover between pax <dig> and pax <dig> when binding the mb- <dig> probe and recruitment of est- <dig>  <cit> . taken together, this motif is highly conserved and may act as a pax <dig> binding site depending on the cellular environment. myod, another identified transcription factor binding to this region, directly regulates gene expression by modulation of the chromatin structure in myogenesis  <cit> . wnt <dig> is expressed in tammar and human muscle and involved in the control of smooth muscle cell fate  <cit>  but the factors that regulate its expression in this process are unknown. our findings suggest that myod could play a conserved role in the regulation of wnt <dig> gene expression.

both human and tammar proximal promoters lack the typical canonical tata box and ccaat box. instead, they feature a high gc content and cpg islands, suggesting other mechanisms, such as dna methylation and chromatin remodelling are required to initiate wnt <dig> transcription. high gc content and cpg islands are typical signatures of promoters that lack a tata box and the usual initiation elements  <cit> . dna methylation can occur on the cytosine base of high gc content regions, and inhibit transcription through the binding of methyl-cpg-binding proteins or by blocking binding of specific transcriptional activators  <cit> . thus, dna methylation and demethylation can act as an alternative mechanism to regulate gene activation. most housekeeping genes are expressed constitutively where cpg islands are unmethylated, whereas the wnt <dig> gene is a spatially and temporally regulated gene during development. our analysis suggests the regulation of wnt <dig> is mediated, at least in part, by dna methylation. however, to confirm this method of wnt <dig> regulatory control, it would be essential to investigate the dna methylation status of the gc rich region in different tissues. interestingly, there is a tata box in the mouse proximal promoter, inferring that the mouse may have developed an additional regulatory region. however, the mouse wnt <dig> promoter still retains the proximal gc rich region as seen in humans and tammar wallaby.

we also identified a highly conserved region in intron  <dig> of the tammar, opossum, human and mouse, which could contain downstream regulatory or enhancer elements. however, when blasting these highly conserved sequences against est databases in genbank, we found that they are expressed in the fetal heart of humans from  <dig> weeks and also in the wolffian ducts of embryonic day  <dig> mice. thus, this region may represent a new gene which overlaps with wnt <dig> or a rare alternative transcript. nevertheless, further investigations are needed to define its expression and function, and to determine its relationship, if any, to wnt <dig> 

in order to compare the conserved promoter activity of the tammar and human wnt <dig> genes, we performed cross-transfection of promoter constructs in both human and tammar cell lines. this is the first functional analysis of a tammar wallaby gene promoter, confirming that primary cell lines can be useful for this type of analysis. the human constructs had a higher relative expression in tammar cell lines than the tammar constructs. one possible reason is that there are more tfbs in human constructs to activate gene expression or fewer inhibitors to repress gene expression. however, similar results were obtained for orthologous promoter regions in both species across both cell lines. this shows that the tfbs have maintained conserved functions over at least  <dig> million years, indicating they are likely to be critical for gene function. our deletion analysis further refined which parts of the conserved region contain the functional promoter region of the wnt <dig> gene and the putative tfbs required for its activation. although this study has identified numerous highly conserved tfbss, further study, including chip/emsa and mutation and transfection analysis is needed to define the precise role of each transcription factor in the regulation of the mammalian wnt <dig> gene.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comparative study of the mammalian wnt <dig> promoter. using a marsupial model, we have been able to provide new information on the transcriptional regulators in the promoter of this essential mammalian developmental gene. these transcription factor binding sites and cpg islands are highly conserved in two disparate mammals, and are likely key controlling elements in the regulation of this essential developmental gene. these findings provide a platform for further targeted approaches to defining the precise function of each tfbs in wnt <dig> regulation.
