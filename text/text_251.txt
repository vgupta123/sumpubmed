BACKGROUND
tularemia is a rare zoonotic disease caused by francisella tularensis, a gram negative, facultative intracellular, fastidious bacterium  <cit> . most infections in animals and humans are caused by two f. tularensis subspecies, f. tularensis subsp. tularensis  and f. tularensis subsp. holarctica . f. tularensis type a is endemic in north america and type b is located in europe, asia, and north america  <cit> . three biotypes of the less virulent type b have been described: biovar i , biovar ii , and biovar japonica which can ferment glycerol  <cit> .

in germany, human infections are usually caused by skinning, preparing or eating infected hares or drinking contaminated water. f. tularensis was sporadically diagnosed in humans in the first half of the 20th century in germany but almost disappeared in the following decades  <cit> . between  <dig> and  <dig> only four sporadic cases of tularemia were notified in hares or rabbits from lower saxony, rhineland-palatinate, north rhine-westphalia and baden-württemberg, respectively  <cit> . after years without reported cases in animals the re-emergence of tularemia started in  <dig> with an outbreak of tularemia in a semi-free living group of marmosets  in lower saxony  <cit> , and in december  <dig> an outbreak with  <dig> human cases due to contact with infected hares was reported from hesse  <cit> . the detection of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica in organ samples of these hares using pcr assays was the beginning of our investigations of tularemia in european brown hares  in germany.

a variety of pcr methods has been established for the detection of f. tularensis dna in both clinical and environmental specimens  <cit> . farlow et al. developed a typing assay based on the variable-number of tandem repeats   <cit>  and johansson et al. also described a twenty-five vntr marker typing system that was used to determine the worldwide genetic relationship among f. tularensis isolates  <cit> . byström et al. selected six of these  <dig> markers that were highly discriminatory in a study of tularemia in denmark  <cit> . vogler et al.  <cit>  investigated the phylogeography of f. tularensis in an extensive study based on whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis. from almost  <dig>  snps identified among  <dig> whole genomes  <dig> clade- and subclade-specific canonical snps were identified and used to genotype  <dig> isolates. this study was expanded upon in another study that used a combination of insertion/deletions  and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular epidemiology of f. tularensis in european brown hares in germany between  <dig> and  <dig>  several previously published typing markers were selected and combined in a pragmatic approach to test whether they are suitable to elucidate the spread of tularemia in germany. this included cultivation, susceptibility testing to erythromycin, a pcr assay for subspecies differentiation detecting a  <dig> bp deletion in the ft-m <dig> locus, vntr typing, indel, snp, and maldi-tof analysis. this is important because it improves our understanding of the spread of tularemia and may help to recognize outbreaks that are not of natural origin.

RESULTS
cultivation and identification of isolates
cultivation of bacteria from organ specimens was successful in  <dig> of  <dig> hares which had a positive pcr result targeting the locus ft-m <dig> that was also used to differentiate f. tularensis subsp. holarctica from other f. tularensis subsp.  <cit> . f. tularensis subsp. holarctica was identified in all  <dig> cases.

biovars
seventeen isolates were susceptible to erythromycin corresponding to biovar i, whereas fourteen were resistant . the geographic distribution is given in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> and the susceptibility of the isolates in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

vntr typing
in a pilot study, six loci  were amplified and sequenced, but only the loci ft-m <dig>  ft-m <dig>  and ft-m <dig> were discriminatory. the strains tested in the pilot study are indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the following identical results were obtained for all these strains: ft-m20:  <dig> bp; ft-m21:  <dig> bp; ft-m22:  <dig> bp. the loci ft-m <dig> and ft-m <dig>  were further used to analyse dna samples extracted from cultivated bacteria. sequencing of ft-m <dig> identified two different repetitive elements, ft-m3a , and ft-m3b , respectively. the number of these repeats was determined separately. the size obtained for ft-m <dig>  correlated with the size observed previously for the b.iv  clade. all vntr results are given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

indel analysis
conventional pcr assays with subsequent gel electrophoretic size determination of the amplicon allowed clear discrimination between amplicons with or without the respective deletions which was confirmed by sequencing in some cases . the  <dig> isolates showed four different indel patterns . based on indels and snps   <dig> isolates were assigned to clade b.i , one to b.ii , and  <dig> to b.iv , according to the nomenclature in karlsson et al.  <dig>  <cit> , where the b.i clade was re-defined to include both b <dig> and b <dig> in svensson et al.  <cit> .

snp typing
the results of snp typing are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  all strains used in a pilot study showed ancestral states of the following snps: b.16:g; b.21:g; b.22:g; b.24:t. these strains are indicated  in additional file 1: table s <dig>  therefore, only the snps b. <dig>  b. <dig>  b. <dig>  and b. <dig> were further investigated for all isolates.

maldi-tof ms analysis
all isolates  yielded high quality spectra. maldi-tof was found to be useful for rapid identification of isolates to subspecies level within one hour. however, the obtained clusters  did not conform to the genetic clusters .
.

geographical clustering
cases of tularemia in hares were identified in eight of sixteen federal states of germany reaching from islands in the north sea to regions at lake constance in the southern part of germany. all cases were found below  <dig> m above sea level. isolates belonging to biovar i could be found in the western part of germany whereas biovar ii occurred in the eastern region . molecular typing resulted in further discrimination of clusters within the biovars. isolates resistant to erythromycin and genetically assigned to clade b.i were found only in lower saxony, thuringia, bavaria and saxony. strains that were sensitive to erythromycin could be assigned to clade b.ii  and b.iv  as given in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

stability testing
the investigated markers for two francisella isolates  were stable even after  <dig> passages in cell culture and had identical results for the markers ft-m <dig> , ft-m <dig> , ftind <dig> , ftind <dig> , and ftind <dig> .

discussion
in thuringia the first case of tularemia in a hare was reported in  <dig>  <cit> . in lower saxony  <dig>  european brown hares and european rabbits  were screened for tularemia between  <dig> and  <dig> using cultivation and pcr assays. francisella specific pcr assays were positive in  <dig> hares and  <dig> rabbit which were further confirmed by cultivation of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica in  <dig> hares  <cit> . in the present study, cases of tularemia in hares in germany from  <dig> to  <dig> were investigated. during this period a total of  <dig> hares were found positive in pcr assays for f. tularensis subsp. holarctica dna and from  <dig> of these cases francisella strains could be isolated. maldi-tof analysis was also used to rapidly identify francisella to the subspecies level as was previously shown by seibold et al.  <cit> .

several positive specimens were found on the north sea islands langeoog and spiekeroog , around soest , darmstadt , and böblingen . these natural foci and also sporadic cases in other regions of germany were found below  <dig> m above sea level. in the czech republic typical natural foci of tularemia occurred in alluvial forests and field biotopes below  <dig> m sea level with mean annual air temperature between  <dig> - <dig> °c and mean annual precipitation of 450– <dig> mm  <cit> . in germany, an outbreak of tularemia in a colony of semi-free living marmosets was located in a region with geographic and ecological conditions similar to the hare habitats in the czech republic: field biotopes  <dig> m above sea level  with  <dig> °c mean annual air temperature and  <dig> mm mean annual precipitation  <cit> . in germany, tularemia of hares occurs in regions with rather humid soil like in alluvial forests and alongside rivers, but this obviously corresponds with the natural habitat of hares.

specimens were screened using a pcr assay targeting ft-m <dig> described by johansson et al.  <cit>  which allows the simultaneous identification of the species f. tularensis and the differentiation of the subspecies holarctica from other  species. all samples could be attributed to f. tularensis subsp. holarctica.

we found a clear segregation of clade b.i and clade b.iv in germany, b.i strains dominate in eastern germany and b.iv within western germany . clade b.i is known to dominate in europe between scandinavia and the black sea  <cit> . the other dominating european clade is b.iv  which can be found over a large area of western and central europe, and, based upon this study, western germany  <cit> . we found only one strain of the b.ii clade isolated in bavaria. strains of the b.ii clade are most frequently isolated in the usa, but are found sporadically in europe as well  <cit> .

the phylogeographical pattern of clade b.i and b.iv, coincide with the geographical distribution of biovar ii and biovar i strains, respectively. previously, biovar i strains  have been reported from western europe , north-america, eastern siberia and the far east while biovar ii is present in the european part of russia as well as northern, central and eastern europe   <cit> . a mixture of both biotypes has been reported in sweden, norway, bulgaria, russia and kazakhstan  <cit> . isolation of both biovars from rodents in a single settlement in moscow as well as from water samples collected in the novgorod region  <cit>  indicate coexistence of the biovars in the same epidemiological foci. taken together, a geographical separation of f. tularensis strains seems to exist in germany. the phenotypically defined biovar i  and phylogenetically defined clade b.iv strains are confined in western germany, whereas biovar ii  and clade b.i strains cluster in eastern germany. this is interesting and may reflect a competition between the two subpopulations or unknown underlying ecological or epidemiological differences.

a deletion in the genome of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica in rd <dig> is typical for strains of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica in france, the iberian peninsula and also switzerland, where biovar i predominates  <cit> . however, in one erythromycin susceptible isolate from bavaria , classified in this study as belonging to the b.ii clade, rd <dig> was not deleted, thus showing that deletion of rd <dig> is not correlated with sensitivity to erythromycin. the molecular mechanisms of resistance to erythromycin have not been functionally established, but mutations identified in domain v of the 23s rrna of biovar ii strains, could provide a likely explanation  <cit> .

although  <dig> vntr markers have been described for the typing of francisella, it is pragmatic to investigate only loci of interest depending on the prevalent subspecies of f. tularensis, the efficiency of pcr assays for single loci, and existing data  <cit> . sequence analysis of the locus ft-m <dig> resulted in two different repeats denominated here as ft-m3a corresponding with sstr9e and ft-m3b corresponding with sstr9a as described previously by johansson et al.  <cit> . johansson et al. and byström et al. also found that locus ft-m <dig> is the most variable marker  <cit> . in the francisella genome variations of dna sequences in spite of identical repeat length have been described for short-sequence tandem repeats  <cit> . locus ft-m <dig> showed less variability with only three pcr fragment sizes being observed among the strains. we obtained the same amplicon sizes that were described in previous studies for locus ft-m <dig>   <cit>  and for locus ft-m <dig>   <cit> . svensson et al. developed a sophisticated real-time pcr array for hierarchical identification of francisella isolates  <cit> . only three  out of five indel loci were discriminatory among our set of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates. ftind <dig> is a marker for b.i to b.iv clades  and is not expected to vary for these isolates, and ftind <dig> is targeting a specific deletion that so far only has been found in lvs. it was possible to simplify these assays to conventional pcr assays that allowed a simple read out based on gel electrophoresis. we identified clusters of strains that had the same indels and snps as strains described by svensson et al.  <cit> . in our study the analysis of vntr and indels of two f. tularensis subsp. holarctica strains  that were passaged twenty times in ma- <dig> cells showed that these genomic elements were stable. johansson et al. demonstrated for two vntr loci  that they were actually stable over  <dig> passages  <cit> . the vntr pattern for strains belonging to clade b.i was more variable compared with the pattern obtained for clade b. iv , as was observed previously  <cit> . this might indicate that clade b.iv is more recently introduced in germany than clade b.i.

we have applied several typing tools in a polyphasic approach in order to determine their value for identifying groups of francisella strains in germany. we found strains belonging to biovars i and ii of f. tularensis subsp. holarctica. although snp loci are the most informative markers for typing of francisella this method may have to be adapted to local strains  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
f. tularensis seems to be a re-emerging pathogen in germany that infects hares in many regions and causes a potential risk for exposed humans such as hunters and others who process hares. the pathogen can easily be identified using pcr assays directly on dna extracted from organ specimens or cultivated strains. isolates can also be identified rapidly using maldi-tof ms in routine laboratories where specific pcr assays for f. tularensis are not established. to identify differences and genetic relatedness of francisella strains, analysis of vntr loci , indels  and snps  was shown to be useful in this set of strains. when time and costs are limiting parameters isolates can be analysed using simplified pcr assays with a focus on genetic loci that are most likely discriminatory among strains found in a specific area. for the future whole genome sequencing using next generation sequencing is desirable and should provide more genetic information of francisella strains. based on these data a more detailed view on the epidemiology of tularemia will become possible  <cit> .
