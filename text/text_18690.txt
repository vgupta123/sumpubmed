BACKGROUND
the capsaicin receptor was first cloned in  <dig>  <cit> , which was later named the transient receptor potential  vanilloid type  <dig> . trpv <dig> is a non-selective cation channel sensitive to noxious heat, ph, putative endovanilloids, and pungent plant products such as capsaicin. trpv <dig> channels are found in some a-delta and unmyelinated c-fibers of peripheral nerves  <cit> , well known as part of the pain conduction pathway. therefore, the trpv <dig> channel is considered a target for pain control, and many trpv <dig> agonists and antagonists are ongoing preclinical and clinical trials as analgesics  <cit> .

resiniferatoxin  is a trpv <dig> agonist isolated from euphorbia resinifera and an ultrapotent capsaicin analog  <cit> . it is more potent than capsaicin by 34-fold in its effects on thermoregulation and neurogenic inflammation  <cit> . unlike capsaicin, binding of rtx to trpv <dig> is irreversible leading to a sustained influx of sodium and calcium through the channels, thereby desensitize the trpv <dig> expressing neurons at the dorsal root ganglion   <cit> . furthermore, rtx has advantages over capsaicin in that it induces less initial irritation and produces less systemic toxicity  <cit> . rtx has been used for perineural injection like a local anesthetic in animal models, and has been shown to produce conduction analgesia without suppressing motor and other sensory function  <cit> . therefore, perineural rtx may hold promise for preventing postoperative pain and consequent chronic neuropathic pain. indeed, numerous studies revealed that pretreatment with perineural rtx, rather than posttreatment, has a preventive effect on the development of neuropathic pain in various animal pain models. for example, perineural rtx prevents mechanical and heat hypersensitivity after carrageenan injection  <cit> , and in sciatic nerve ligation model of rats, perineural rtx attenuated the development of mechanical and heat hypersensitivity  <cit> . however, the effectiveness of perineural rtx on preventing cold hypersensitivity is unclear.

since the characterization of trpv <dig>  many other families of transient receptor potential channel have been discovered. among them, transient receptor potential melastatin type  <dig>  and transient receptor potential ankyrin type  <dig>  are known as ‘cold sensitive’ channels  <cit> . these thermo-sensitive channels  are known to be involved in the development of neuropathic pain, and many researchers have reported that expression of these channels in sensory neurons are increased in various neuropathic pain models .

in our current study, we investigated the preventive effect of perineural rtx on the development of cold hypersensitivity induced by spinal nerve ligation  in rats. furthermore, we examined the association between the expression level of trpv <dig>  trpm <dig>  and trpa <dig> in the drg and cold hypersensitivity after snl.

RESULTS
behavioral tests
the baseline paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli in all rats before snl surgery was 15 g . as shown in fig.  <dig>  snl significantly reduced the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli after 1 week, and this effect was sustained for 4 weeks after snl. perineural administration of rtx 1 µg inhibited the development of snl-induced mechanical hypersensitivity throughout the whole experimental period, with a significant difference noted compared to the rtx 0 µg group from  <dig> to 3 weeks after snl. the paw withdrawal response to heat stimuli  is shown in fig.  <dig>  compared to baseline values, paw withdrawal latency to heat stimuli significantly decreased from  <dig> to 2 weeks after snl. pretreatment of both rtx 1 µg and  <dig>  µg resulted in a significant protective effect against snl-induced heat hyperalgesia. in the cold-plate test, snl resulted in significant cold hypersensitivity throughout the whole experimental period . in the rtx 1 µg group, the threshold to cold stimuli was higher than in the rtx 0 µg group throughout the experimental period. this protective effect showed statistical significance at  <dig> and 2 weeks compared to the rtx 0 µg group. in contrast, pretreatment with rtx  <dig>  µg did not produce a protective effect on snl-induced cold hypersensitivity . the results of the mechanical, cold and hot hypersensitivity are also provided as an additional file .fig.  <dig> effect of resiniferatoxin  pretreatment on the withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimuli. perineural administration of vehicle or rtx  was performed before spinal nerve ligatoin . behavioral tests were performed before surgery and weekly for 4 weeks after snl. to test mechanical hyperalgesia, a von frey filament was used to stimulate the plantar surface of the ipsilateral left hind foot. the data are presented as the mean ± standard error. **p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  compared to the rtx 0 µg group

immunofluorescence analysis of trpm <dig> expression
as shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  immunofluorescence analysis revealed that snl surgery  led to an increased trend in the number of trpm8-positive neurons in the drg compared with the sham-operated control group. in the rtx 1 µg group, this increase in the number of trpm8-expressing neurons was not observed. the results of trpm <dig> immunoreactive neuronal cell counts are further provided in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> immunofluorescence view of transient receptor potential mellastatin type  <dig>  expression after resiniferatoxin  pretreatment. perineural administration with vehicle or rtx  was performed before spinal nerve ligation . to evaluate the protein expression level of trpm <dig> located in the drg, the ipsilateral  l <dig> and l <dig> drg were isolated 4 weeks after snl and confocal immunofluorescence analysis was performed. mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  counterstain was dispersed over the sections before mounting. a trpm <dig> expression  in the drg of sham-operated control group rats. b trpm <dig> expression  in the drg of rtx 0 µg group rats. trpm <dig> expression in the drg was up-regulated and the co-localization of trpm <dig> expressing neurons with nf200-positive neurons  was increased . c trpm <dig> expression  in the drg of rtx 1 µg group rats. trpm <dig> expression was suppressed compared to that of the rtx 0 µg group

discussion
in our current study using a rat model, we found that pretreatment with perineural rtx significantly inhibited mechanical, heat, and cold hypersensitivity after snl. western blot analysis demonstrated that trpv <dig> and trpm <dig> protein expression levels in the drg had increased 4 weeks after snl. perineural pretreatment with rtx reduced the expression level of trpm <dig>  but not of trpv <dig> in the drg 4 weeks after snl.

the protective effect of perineural rtx pretreatment on the development of heat and mechanical hypersensitivity has been demonstrated in previous studies using neuropathic models. for example, kissin et al. reported that pretreatment with perineural rtx reduced the development of mechanical and heat hypersensitivity after carrageenan injection and sciatic nerve ligation  <cit> . other authors also reported reduced mechanical and heat hypersensitivity in rtx-pretreated rats after carrageenan injection and common peroneal/tibial nerve ligation  <cit> . our findings are consistent with these previous experiments and strengthen the evidence for the protective role of rtx on the development of mechanical and heat hypersensitivity.

following nerve injury, cold hypersensitivity may develop in addition to mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. indeed, cold allodynia and hyperalgesia are common symptoms in patients presenting with neuropathic pain. therefore, the ideal medication to prevent neuropathic pain must have protective effects against cold hypersensitivity along with the protective effects against mechanical and heat hypersensitivity. however, whether perineural rtx exerts a protective effect on cold hypersensitivity remains unclear. recently, cruz et al. reported that intraganglionic rtx prevents cold hypersensitivity induced by carrageenan injection into the upper lip and constriction of the infraorbital nerve  <cit> . in our present study, perineural rtx treatment before nerve injury significantly reduced the development of cold hypersensitivity throughout the entire study period. taken together, these results indicate that perineural rtx treatment may be an effective method of preventing cold hypersensitivity.

our experiments focused on the effect and relationship of perineural rtx on the expression of trp channels after snl. various neuropathic pain models have shown that trpv <dig> expression in the peripheral nerve increases following nerve injury . nerve injury induces neuropathic pain and especially heat hypersensitivity, which is known to be closely related with increased levels of trpv <dig> expression. for instance, in two experiments using an snl model of rats, ligation of the l <dig> nerve was associated with increased trpv <dig> expression in the l <dig> drg  <cit> . trpv <dig> is known to be related not only to the development of heat hypersensitivity but also to mechanical hypersensitivity  <cit> , but the role of trpv <dig> in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity is controversial. previous studies have demonstrated that administration of trpv <dig> antagonists in a neuropathic pain model did not attenuate the development of mechanical hypersensitivity  <cit> . furthermore, in a paw incision pain model of trpv <dig> knockout mice, the development of heat hypersensitivity was suppressed, but in contrast, mechanical hypersensitivity was preserved  <cit> . however, there are evidences that trpv <dig> contributes in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity, especially in the chronic phase. previous studies demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotide against trpv <dig> reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in snl rats and selective antagonists of trpv <dig> attenuated the development of mechanical hypersensitivity . our current study results also showed that trpv <dig> expression levels were increased after snl, which is in agreement with previous study results.

in the present study, we further attempted to elucidate the relationship between cold hypersensitivity and trp receptors. the trpm <dig> is well known to be a cold receptor and a potential transducer for cold temperature mediated allodynia and hyperalgesia. several studies have shown that trpm <dig> expression may be associated with the development of neuropathic pain. for example, frederick et al. reported that the rna level of trpm <dig> significantly increased after sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury   <cit> . other reports showed that cci increased trpm <dig> expression in the drg  <cit> . furthermore, nocifencive behavior of mice to cold stimuli has been shown to be related to trpm <dig> expression  <cit> . in our study results, the trpm <dig> expression was increased after snl observed through both western blot analysis and immunofluorescence analysis. this increase of trpm <dig> expression was prevented by rtx pretreatment. therefore, together with our present results, the preventive effects of perineural rtx on snl-induced cold hypersensitivity appear to be closely related to the expression of trpm <dig> in the drg. another interesting finding was that increased co-localization of trpm <dig> and nf  <dig> positive myelinated neurons were detected after snl surgery. previous study by ji et al. reported that in the spinal nerve ligated neuropathic rat presenting cold hypersensitivity, the number of small myelinated a-delta fibers were significantly increased and the number of c-fibers were relatively constant in the plantar skin of the affected hind limb  <cit> . the authors have concluded that the a-delta fibers provide major contribution in the development of cold hypersensitivity in neuropathic pain. although the results in this study were electrophysiological quantification of the a-delta and c fibers in the peripheral nerve, the results of this study support our findings of increased expressions of trpm <dig> in the myelinated neurons at the drg in the snl group demonstrating cold hypersensitivity. the result of our study gives further information that the a-delta fibers presenting trpm <dig> may regulate cold hypersensitivity in neuropathic rats.

in contrast to trpm <dig>  the expression level of trpa <dig>  another cold receptor, in the drg did not differ between the three groups at 4 weeks after snl. in fact, the association between the expression level of trpa <dig> and cold hypersensitivity remains controversial. first, many previous studies suggested that trpa <dig> is related to the development of cold allodynia and hyperalgesia , which is not supported by our current data. this discrepancy may be explained by the time course of trpa <dig> expression. in a previous study of a sciatic nerve injury model in rats, trpa <dig> rna levels in the drg increased  <dig> and 2 weeks after nerve injury, while trpm <dig> rna levels increased 2 weeks after nerve injury  <cit> . in our present study, the trpa <dig> protein level in the drg was only measured 4 weeks after snl, while the expression level of trpa <dig> at 1–3 weeks were not investigated. second, some studies have reported inconsistent results on the association between trpa <dig> and cold hypersensitivity. for example, one study using trpm8- and trpa1-knockout animals reported that noxious cold signaling may not be related to trpa <dig>  <cit> . the authors showed that nocifencive behavior to cold stimuli was absent in trpm8-knockout and trpm8/trpa1-double-knockout mice, but were retained in trpa1-null mice. our present study provides evidence that trpm <dig> expression, but not trpa <dig> expression, is related to cold hypersensitivity at 4 weeks after snl.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, pretreatment with perineural rtx inhibits the development of snl-induced mechanical, heat, and cold hypersensitivity. the antinociceptive effect of perineural rtx against cold stimuli seems to be related to the trpm <dig> expression in the drg.
