BACKGROUND
the discovery that mammalian cells grown in the presence of inhibitors of mitochondrial dna  replication and transcription can lose all or almost all their mtdna has provided a powerful means to study interactions between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, reviewed in  <cit> . the human mitochondrial genome is  <dig> -bp in length and encodes 12s and 16s rrnas,  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> polypeptides involved in the respiratory electron transport chain and atp synthesis. the comprehensive mitop <dig> database of human mitochondrial proteins    lists  <dig> human mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nuclear genome  <cit> . proteomic and systems biology approaches will likely unearth additional proteins directly involved in human mitochondrial function  <cit> . however, fundamental questions will remain about the influences mtdna has on the regulation of nuclear genes in vivo.

mtdna-depleted ρ <dig> cell lines are auxotrophic for pyruvate and uridine, and are incapable of aerobic respiration due to the lack of key respiratory chain components  <cit> . nonetheless, mtdna-depleted cell lines possess distorted mitochondria-like structures comprised of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins  <cit>  and demonstrate increased invasive behavior in culture  <cit>  furthermore, mtdna-depleted cells can grow as tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice in some instances  <cit> , but not others  <cit> .

here, we generated mtdna-depleted a <dig> ρ <dig> lung cancer cells and validated their genetic and biochemical properties in culture and tumor xenografts. our gene expression profiling analyses of parental a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells uncovered differential expression of transcripts relevant to immune recognition, autophagy of defective mitochondria, hif-mediated gene regulation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition , and elimination of lipophilic molecules. furthermore, growth in culture versus in xenograft had a greater effect on the a <dig> transcriptome, especially nuclear-encoded genes important for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, than the presence of mtdna. overall, mtdna-depleted cells grown in culture and in xenograft provide complementary means to identify relationships between mitochondrial activity and cellular gene expression profiles that could serve as potential biomarkers of disease.

methods
cells and cell culture reagents
a <dig> lung cancer cells were obtained from the american type culture collection. unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from invitrogen. mtdna-deficient a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures were prepared by serial passage of parental a <dig> cells for  <dig> population doublings in standard growth media ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin, and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin) in the presence of ethidium bromide , sodium pyruvate , and uridine . the glucose concentration in the standard growth media is approximately  <dig> mm. all subsequent experiments employing a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures were conducted in the same standard growth media supplemented only with sodium pyruvate  and uridine . growth curves were obtained by coulter counting. all experiments were conducted using cell culture populations and not purified clones.

estimation of mtdna levels
mtdna levels in a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures were estimated using the pseudogene ratioing method  <cit> . briefly, total dna  was extracted from a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures using the qiaamp dna mini kit . these served as templates for pcr amplification using primers designed to anneal either to mtdna or a previously described dna-embedded mtdna pseudogene   <cit> . amplicons derived from either nuclear dna-embedded mtdna pseudogene or mtdna templates are predicted to be approximately the same length, but differ in sequence. these amplicons served as templates for a nested pcr using primers designed to amplify both the mtdna-encoded mt-co <dig> and the nuclear dna-embedded mtdnaψ sequences. the resulting amplicons were subcloned using the strataclone™ pcr cloning system . plasmid dna from individual colonies was prepared for sequencing using the illustra templiphi 100/ <dig> dna amplification kit . the resulting products were sequenced using bigdye terminator v <dig>  from applied biosystems diluted with halfbd , according to manufacturer's recommendations. we obtained sequence information from  <dig> colonies derived from a <dig> dna templates  and  <dig> colonies derived from a <dig> ρ <dig> dna templates . mtdna abundance in the original a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> dna preparation was estimated based on the number of colonies showing mtdna or mtdnaψ sequences, as previously described  <cit> .

oxygen consumption
oxygen consumption rates were measured using a clark-type electrode  <cit> . in brief, plateau phase cultures of a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> cells were treated with antimycin a  or control vehicle for  <dig> hours. after medium was removed, cells were washed with hanks balanced salt solution , and harvested using trypsin/edta. cells were resuspended in complete medium, stored on ice, and aliquots were removed for coulter counting and viability . prior to measurement, an aliquot of cell suspension  was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> minutes, and then transferred to the sealed electrode chamber of an oxytherm apparatus  to measure dissolved oxygen concentration. background oxygen consumption by the electrode in the absence of cells was subtracted from all measurements.

quantitative rt-pcr analysis
rna was obtained from cultured a <dig> cells or harvested from tumor specimens as described  <cit> . total rna was quantified using the ribogreen rna quantitation kit . one-step rt-pcr assays were set up in triplicate according to manufacturer's instructions using the taqman master mix  and  <dig> ng of total rna as template. the amount of rna in each well was re-quantified and used for normalizations. gene expression assay probe sets for β-actin, mt-atp <dig>  and mt-cyb were purchased from applied biosystems and assays were performed on an abi prism  <dig> instrument according to standard protocols.

elisa and western blotting
total hif-1a protein was detected by sandwich elisa using the duoset ic™ hif-1a elisa kit obtained from r&d systems. briefly, 96-well plates were coated with hif-1a capture antibody overnight prior to blocking with 5% bsa in wash buffer. protein lysates  were added for  <dig> hours, whereupon plates were washed and a biotinylated detection antibody specific for hif-1a was added. a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase format was used for detection. the optical density at  <dig> minus  <dig> nm was measured using a microplate reader . hif-1a concentrations were calculated by linear regression using a standard curve prepared from hif-1a standard supplied with the elisa kit.

western blotting was performed using antibodies against glut <dig> , pgk <dig> , mtco <dig> , pdk <dig> , and ddit <dig>  obtained from santa cruz biotechnology, molecular probes, stressgen, and proteintech, respectively. all membranes were blotted with an anti-hsc <dig>  antibody to control for loading and transfer. hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from pierce. hrp-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody was from santa cruz biotechnology. hrp substrate was from pierce. bands were imaged and quantified in the linear range and normalized to hsc <dig>  using the chemidoc xrs imaging system .

gene expression profiling in cell culture
a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> human lung cancer cells  were seeded  <dig> days prior to rna isolation. each experiment was performed in triplicate. after incubation, all cultures were washed twice with hbss supplemented with  <dig> % bsa and total rna was isolated and subjected to analysis on human genome u133a arrays , as described  <cit> . arrayassist software  was used to generate scaled log <dig> transformed gene expression scores based on the rma algorithm and to conduct hierarchical clustering analyses, as previously described  <cit> . probe sets with a >  <dig> -fold differential expression  in a comparison of interest are reported.

we used analysis of variance to estimate the proportion of variance explained by mtdna status and explained by growth conditions, in the gene expression profiles from a <dig> ρ <dig> and parental a <dig> cells grown in culture and in xenografts. statistical significance is determined using the bayes moderated f test  <cit>  implemented using the limma package in bioconductor  <cit> . this uses an empirical bayes approach, providing more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. p-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using the benjamini and hochberg approach to control the false-discovery rate  <cit> .

geneontology and kegg analyses were conducted using webgestalt software  <cit> . all scaled fluorescent intensity values and .cel files are available at the national center for biotechnology information  gene expression omnibus  repository  under series accession number gse <dig>  in addition, all scaled fluorescent intensity values are available in supplemental table  <dig>

gene expression profiling in mouse xenograft models
animal care was in accordance with nih and institutional guidelines. for the a <dig> xenograft model,  <dig>  million a <dig> cells were injected subcutaneously/intramuscularly into the right hind flank of  <dig> week old cd- <dig> nude mice that had been irradiated with  <dig> gy of total body irradiation from a 137cs radiation source one day prior to tumor implantation  <cit> . for the a <dig> ρ <dig> xenograft model,  <dig>  million cells were used. tumor and body weight measurements  were performed three times per week once tumors became palpable. this occurred  <dig> versus  <dig> days post-implantation in ρ <dig> and parental a <dig> xenograft models, respectively. tumor volume was calculated using the equation v  = a × b2/ <dig>  where a is the largest diameter and b is the smallest diameter. no significant body weight loss was observed. to perform gene expression profiling, tumors  were harvested and snap frozen immediately on dry ice when the tumor size reached 500– <dig> mm <dig>  tumor tissue was dissected, homogenized in trizol, and total rna was isolated and subjected to gene expression analysis as described above.

RESULTS
establishment of a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures
candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> lung cancer cell cultures were prepared using previously described ethidium bromide-based protocols  <cit> . consistent with prior reports of ρ <dig> cell lines , the resulting cells displayed auxotrophic growth dependence on pyruvate and uridine and elongated shape . the growth rate of the candidate ρ <dig> cells  was slower than the parental line  in pyruvate and uridine supplemented medium .

we used the recently described pseudo-gene ratioing technique to estimate the amount of mtdna remaining in the candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures   <cit> . this technique is based on quantifying the relative co-amplification of a mtdna sequence and a nuclear-embedded mitochondrial pseudogene  sequence  <cit>  using total dna extracted from candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> cells and parental a <dig> cells. assuming the mtdnaψ sequence is present in two copies per candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> cell, we could estimate with 95% confidence that the candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures contained less than one copy of mtdna per  <dig> cells. as a positive control, we used the same technique to estimate that a minimum of  <dig> mtdna copies were extracted from each parental a <dig> cell . as a consequence of these observations, as well other biochemical characterizations described below, we will hereafter refer to the candidate a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures as a <dig> ρ0cells.

cultured a <dig> ρ <dig> cells have impaired rates of oxygen consumption
to characterize mitochondrial function in the parental a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells, we compared their rates of oxygen consumption. as expected, parental a <dig> cells showed robust oxygen consumption while the oxygen consumption of the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells was indistinguishable  from background . to demonstrate the involvement of respiration, we also treated parental a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells with antimycin a, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex iii of the electron transport chain   <cit> , prior to measuring oxygen consumption. as expected, antimycin a-treated a <dig> cells showed reduced oxygen consumption, while a <dig> ρ <dig> cells were not significantly affected by drug-treatment . these results strongly suggest that residual mitochondria-dependent aerobic respiration in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells, if present, is below the threshold that can be measured in this assay.

a <dig> ρ <dig> cells grow in tumor xenografts at a slower rate than their parental cells
parental a <dig> cells and their ρ <dig> derivatives both grew as xenografts when implanted shallowly  in the flank muscle of nude mice. mtdna-depleted cell lines have been reported to form xenograft tumors  <cit> . here, we found that a <dig> ρ <dig> cells grow readily in xenograft, although at a slower rate and after a longer induction period  relative to the parental line . this is consistent with the growth characteristics of tumor xenografts derived from n2b ρ <dig> osteosarcoma  <cit> , e <dig> ρ <dig> serous ovarian carcinoma  <cit> , hsa ρ <dig> cervical cancer  <cit> , and t47d ρ <dig> breast cancer  <cit>  cell lines relative to their parental counterparts.

a <dig> ρ <dig> cells do not express mtdna-derived transcripts in culture or in xenografts
we performed quantitative pcr analysis of mtdna-encoded mt-atp <dig> and mt-cyb transcripts in a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells grown in culture and in xenografts, in the absence of ethidium bromide. in contrast to the parental a <dig> cells, the expression of these two transcripts could not be detected in ρ <dig> cells . this strongly suggests that, in bulk, the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells retained their mtdna-depleted genotype over the course of their growth in culture and in xenograft. this was important to ascertain since it was possible that during their growth in xenograft, rare mtdna-positive cells present in the injected a <dig> ρ <dig> cell population could have substantially increased in abundance and affected our downstream analyses. similarly, it is possible that a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> cells with certain genetic or epigenetic changes  were selected for in culture or in xenografts and affected our results. this should be considered when interpreting the molecular analyses discussed below.

gene expression profiling of cultured cells
gene expression profiles were generated in plateau phase a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells cultured in fresh medium supplemented with pyruvate and uridine prior to rna isolation . all  <dig> transcripts that were differentially expressed , and >  <dig> unit difference in geometric mean expression scores) are listed in additional file  <dig>  these include  <dig> transcripts that were more highly expressed in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells and  <dig> that were more highly expressed in a <dig> cells.

increased levels of emt-related transcripts in cultured a <dig> ρ <dig> cells
to analyze differentially expressed genes in a <dig> cells and their mtdna-depleted ρ <dig> counterparts, we conducted gene ontology  analyses on transcripts that were more highly expressed in the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells than the parental cell line . we used stringent criteria  for selection of enriched categories. the enriched categories included those related to cell adhesion  and cell motility . upon further inspection of the transcripts in these categories, it became apparent that they reflect transcriptional signatures of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition , a developmental process by which stationary epithelial cells transform into mobile mesenchymal cells  <cit> . emt can be driven by the activity of the transcription factor snai <dig>  positively regulated by loxl <dig>  <cit> , which leads to the over-expression of cdh <dig>  itgb <dig>  and vim. all five genes are over-expressed in the ρ <dig> cells. the fact that cdh <dig> and fga are also less abundant in the ρ <dig> cells further supports the hypothesis that the ρ <dig> cells show an increasingly mesenchymal phenotype relative to their parental counterparts  <cit> . the above observations are consistent with prior reports of mtdna-depleted a <dig> cells showing increased invasive behavior relative to parental a <dig> cells in a matrigel basement membrane matrix invasion assay system  <cit> .

increased metal ion binding and glucuronidation gene expression in a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures
two enriched go categories were related to metal ion binding  and glucuronidation . the increased expression of mtf- <dig> regulated genes  could indicate higher baseline levels of oxidative stress and/or free metals in the ρ <dig> cells relative to their parental counterparts  <cit> . however, it is noteworthy that several oxidative stress response genes  are under-expressed in these ρ <dig> cells. glucuronidation is a cellular metabolic pathway in which udp-glucuronosyltransferases  convert lipophilic compounds, both endogenous and xenobiotic, into more readily excreted polar products. ugts catalyze the transfer of the glucuronate moiety of uridine diphosphoglucuronate  to specific substrates, in order to attain this increased polarity. the observed differentially expressed ugt1a family members have different substrate specificities and collectively can react with a variety of endogenous lipophilic molecules, such as fatty acids and steroids  <cit> . given that ρ <dig> skin fibroblasts have impaired mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation  <cit> , we propose that the increased abundance of glucuronidation-related transcripts in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells is a survival mechanism to remove excess fatty acids that are normally metabolized to carbon dioxide and water in functional mitochondria.

expression profiles of hif- <dig> responsive transcripts in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells
next, we focused on identifying key transcription factors that could account for a significant number of over-expressed transcripts in a <dig> ρ0cells. mtdna-deficient cells have proven useful for dissecting the role that mitochondria play in hif-mediated responses to oxygen levels . in fact, increased baseline levels of hif- <dig> activity in cultured ρ <dig> cell lines have been noted by others  <cit> . in our a <dig> ρ <dig> cells, hif- <dig> appeared to be an excellent candidate given the over-expression of two well-established downstream genes . we began our analyses by focusing on a group of  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> unique hif- <dig> responsive genes highlighted in a recent comprehensive review  <cit>  . while no other hif- <dig> responsive genes reached our statistical criteria for over-expression, four other well-established hif- <dig> regulated transcripts  were less abundant in the ρ <dig> cells relative to their parental cells. this could reflect the influence of other transcription factors or accessory proteins that regulate hif- <dig> activity.

the mechanism underlying the differential expression of hif-regulated transcripts in mtdna-deficient cells is unknown. for example, it has been proposed that a feedback loop involving mitochondrial enzymes and citric acid cycle intermediates leads to hif- <dig> stabilization and tumorigenesis in several inherited forms of cancer caused by mtdna mutations  <cit> . another possible explanation might involve insulin-like growth factor signaling which has been shown to increase hif- <dig> levels  <cit> . importantly, the go category insulin-like growth factor binding  was enriched for transcripts that were more abundant in the ρ <dig> relative to parental cells .

a <dig> ρ <dig> cells over-express hif- <dig> a protein relative to the parental cell line
to explore the mechanistic basis for the observed differential expression of hif-responsive transcripts in culture, we measured the levels of hif-1α protein in ρ <dig> and parental cells by elisa . the background levels of hif-1α were found to be 3-fold higher in ρ <dig> cells compared to the parental line. hif-1α levels increased in the parental a <dig> line following treatment with cobalt acetate or incubation under hypoxic  conditions. in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells, hif-1α levels were increased modestly following cobalt treatment but did not appear to be changed by hypoxic treatment. however, the level of hif-1α protein does not solely determine its ability to induce gene expression, as post-transcriptional modifications are also known to modulate its activity  <cit> .

to further explore the possible functional consequences of hif- <dig> over-expression, we measured the levels of several hif-regulated gene products by western blot . the mt-co <dig> product was included in this analysis to demonstrate the absence of this mtdna-encoded protein in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells. in accordance with the expression data, we found that pgk <dig> and ddit <dig> protein levels were increased in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells . however, glut <dig>  protein levels were essentially unchanged in a <dig> and a <dig> ρ <dig> cells despite the fact that its transcript was  <dig> -fold more abundant  in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells. as could be expected, the incubation of either parental or ρ <dig> cells in the presence of cobalt or under hypoxic conditions led to increased levels of these hif-regulated proteins. the effect of cobalt was not as significant as that of hypoxia under these conditions. these data demonstrate that although baseline hif- <dig> activity is higher in ρ <dig> than parental cells, hif-regulated activity can be induced further in both cases.

decreased icosanoid metabolism and cytoskeleton gene expression in cultured a <dig> ρ <dig> cells
in parallel, we conducted separate go analyses on transcripts that were less abundant in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells  . the blood pressure regulation  and icosanoid metabolism  go categories were significantly enriched for such transcripts. the presence of multiple fibrinogen family members in the former category could reflect possible differences in cell adhesion in ρ <dig> cells. the icosanoid metabolism category could relate to the role arachidonic acid plays in the regulation of steroidogenesis and mitochondrial membrane permeability. it has been proposed that atp generated by oxidative phosphorylation plays a key role in the generation and export of arachidonic acid from the mitochondria  <cit> . through its role in leukotriene metabolism, arachidonic acid mediates the activity of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein , a key regulator of steroidogenesis. in addition, arachidonic acid can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation and alter mitochondrial membrane permeability  <cit> .

the intermediate filament go category was enriched for transcripts that were less abundant in ρ <dig> cells . krt <dig> plays a key role in maintaining the normal morphology of mitochondria  <cit> . interestingly, vim, another component of intermediate filaments shown to support mitochondrial morphology and organization  <cit> , is over-expressed in ρ <dig> cells. the dysregulation of intermediate filament genes in ρ <dig> cells could contribute to their aberrant mitochondrial morphology and/or represent cellular responses to rescue mitochondrial organization.

increased trna synthetase, mhc class i, and lysosome gene expression in a <dig> ρ <dig> xenografts
total rna from a <dig> or a <dig> ρ <dig> tumors  were also subject to gene expression profiling analysis . all  <dig> transcripts that were differentially expressed are listed in additional file  <dig>  these include  <dig> transcripts that were more highly expressed in the a <dig> ρ <dig> tumors and  <dig> that were more highly expressed in a <dig> tumors. three major functional categories emerged from go analyses of over-expressed genes in ρ <dig> xenografts . these categories were related to trna aminoacylation , mhc class i , and the lysosome .

the transcriptional induction of trna synthetases was previously highlighted in the analysis of cultured ρ <dig> and parental lymphoblasts  <cit> . recently, there is increased evidence that trna synthetases have functions additional to joining specific amino acids to their cognate trnas. these include the regulation of angiogenesis and inflammation  <cit> .

the over-expression of mhc class i peptides is consistent with a report that mhc i is over-expressed in fibroblasts from patients with mtdna defects as well as in cultured osteosarcoma ρ <dig> cells relative to their parental counterparts  <cit> . in that study, ifn-γ treatment enhanced mhc <dig> over-expression in cultured osteosarcoma ρ <dig> cells. thus, the over-expression of interferon gamma receptor  <dig>  we observed in a <dig> ρ <dig> xenografts  could play a role in further stimulating mhc class i peptide expression in these cells.

it has been proposed that mhc class i over-expression in cells with mutated mitochondrial proteins provides a mechanism by which the immune system can recognize and eliminate defective cells  <cit> . although ρ <dig> cells do not have dysfunctional proteins encoded by mtdna, the over-expression of mhc class i genes may simply reflect a mechanism for marking cells with defective mitochondrial function.

the over-expression of lysosome genes could relate to their function in removing defective mitochondria within cells through autophagy  <cit> . this could complement the immune surveillance mediated removal of cells with defective mitochondria discussed above. we speculate that the over-expression of lysosome-related genes could reflect increased numbers of lysosomes and/or simply the increased functional activity of existing lysosomes.

a <dig> ρ <dig> xenograft transcriptomes indicate decreased cell proliferation and glycolysis
mitosis  and spindle organization and biogenesis  were two major functional categories showing enrichment for down-regulated transcripts in a <dig> ρ <dig> xenografts . this would be expected given the lower proliferation rate of the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells relative to their parental counterparts . the enrichment in the actin binding  and cytoskeleton protein binding  categories could also reflect differences in growth rates. alternatively, they could relate to altered mitochondrial morphology, as discussed in our analysis of cultured ρ <dig> cells.

surprisingly, a <dig> ρ <dig> xenografts showed decreased expression in the glycolysis category . this would appear to be counter-intuitive given the fact that these xenografts do not express mtdna-derived transcripts  or mt-cox <dig> protein  and thus should have severely impaired oxidative phosphorylation. indeed, the  <dig> -fold increased abundance of pck <dig> in a <dig> ρ0cells could indicate higher levels of gluconeogenesis, consistent with prior reports in mtdna-depleted a <dig>  <cit> , 206b ρ0osteosarcoma  <cit> , and arpe <dig> ρ <dig> retinal pigment epithelial  <cit>  cultured cells. apart from the aforementioned lower growth rate of ρ <dig> xenografts, this probably reflects the general reduced abundance of hif-regulated transcripts  as compared to the parental a <dig> xenografts . this occurs despite the fact that hif-1α is over-expressed  along with two other well-established hif targets . as discussed earlier, this is consistent with the post-translational control of hif- <dig> α activity  and/or the activity of other transcription factors.

contribution of mtdna to gene expression profiles of cultured cells and xenografts
while gene expression differences between a <dig> cells grown in culture and in xenograft have been reported  <cit> , comparison for both parental and mtdna-deficient cells have not been previously performed. interestingly, a greater number of transcripts were differentially expressed due to growth conditions  than by mtdna status. importantly, infiltrating mouse cells have been demonstrated not to influence significantly gene expression profiles of tumor xenografts when using similar affymetrix human microarrays  <cit> . all  <dig>  transcripts that were differentially expressed in xenograft versus culture for the parental a <dig> line are listed in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig>  differentially expressed transcripts for the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells grown in xenograft versus culture are listed in additional file  <dig> . these results are borne out by hierarchical clustering analysis which first shows a clear separation of the gene expression profiles grown in culture versus xenograft and then separation according to mtdna status, based on gene expression data obtained from  <dig> probe sets whose coefficient of variation was greater than  <dig>  .

we calculated the relative fraction of the variance associated with mtdna status in the gene expression profiles from a <dig> ρ <dig> and parental a <dig> cells grown in culture and in xenografts . in particular, we focused on those transcripts for which over 50% of the variance  could be explained by mtdna status and where there was significant differential expression in any two of the pair-wise comparisons of a <dig> ρ <dig> and parental a <dig> cells grown in culture or in xenograft. overall, we discovered  <dig> transcripts  that met these criteria . table  <dig> provides a listing of a subset of these transcripts where at least 90% of the variance in gene expression was dependent upon mtdna status.

importantly, the probe set that was most strongly affected  by mtdna status measures the relative abundance of mt-nd <dig>  the only mtdna-encoded transcript represented in this microarray . mt-nd <dig> is not expressed in the a <dig> ρ <dig> cells in culture or in xenograft . this provided us with empirical proof that our sorting strategy was sensitive to detecting transcripts dependent upon mtdna status. overall, we found that the variance in the expression of transcripts within mhc- <dig>  and glucuronidation  go categories are all highly dependent upon mtdna status . these transcripts were more abundant in a <dig> ρ <dig> relative to the parental a <dig> cells. the mhc- <dig> and glucuronosyltransferase categories were previously discussed as having significance for the immune surveillance of cells with effective mitochondria and the detoxification of lipids that can accumulate due to defects in fatty acid metabolism. on the other hand, transcripts related to the protein complex assembly  and chromatin  go categories were highly dependent upon mtdna status and less abundant in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells relative to the parental a <dig> cells . this could reflect their slower growth rates relative to the parental cell line.

in addition, mtdna status affected multiple transcripts related to the above discussed epithelial-mesenchymal transition . over 50% of the variance in the expression levels derived from probe sets for the previously described snai <dig>  itgb <dig>  cdh <dig>  and fga genes could be explained by mtdna status. the expression levels of all these genes indicated a <dig> ρ <dig> cells have increased mesenchymal phenotypes relative to the parental a <dig> cells. however, the fold-changes in expression of these genes in ρ <dig> versus parental cells were greater in culture than in the tumor xenografts .

in contrast to genome-wide expression studies performed in yeast lacking mtdna , we observed no evidence for a strong dependence of the variance in peroxisomal gene expression  genes responsible for peroxisome assembly) due to mtdna status  <cit> . nevertheless, this does not preclude mtdna status affecting peroxisome function, through abundance and/or activity. for example, we observed that the mtdna status had a significant effect on phyh expression . phyh encodes a peroxisomal enzyme critical for the catabolism of phytanic acid, a branched chain fatty acid  <cit> . amacr, which also encodes an enzyme critical for phytanic acid metabolism, is also expressed higher in a <dig> ρ <dig> xenografts relative to a <dig> xenografts . interestingly, amacr, which localizes to both peroxisomes and mitochondria, is an emerging biomarker for prostate cancer  <cit> . given reports of frequent mitochondrial defects in prostate cancer  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that the over-expression of amacr in prostate cancer could be related to defective mitochondrial function. however, it should be emphasized that the mitochondrial defects in our mtdna-depleted a <dig> system will be more severe than those found in human tumors.

mtdna-dependent expression profiles show agreement with prior reports
it can be questioned whether the observed mtdna-dependent gene expression profiles are  shared amongst all cell lines,  unique to our system, or  reflect possible mutations in acquired in the nuclear genome of the ethidium bromide-treated a <dig> ρ <dig> cells. to begin to address these issues, we searched for previous reports of differential gene expression in cultured ρ <dig> cells relative to their parental cell lines. it is important to note that there is a limited literature on gene expression profiling in mtdna-depleted cell cultures  <cit>  and that there are no previous reports of gene expression profiling in mtdna-depleted xenografts. nevertheless, we found confirmatory evidence for our observed major categories of mtdna-dependent transcripts levels including: trna synthetases , mhc-related transcript , udp-glucuronosyltransferase , and hif1-α . furthermore, the fxy2d <dig>  and the vldr transcripts, whose levels were strongly dependent upon mtdna-status and over-abundant in a <dig> ρ <dig> cells , were found to be over-expressed in human fibroblasts with mutations in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial complex i genes  <cit>  and retinal pigment epithelial ρ <dig> cells  <cit> , respectively. similarly, metallothionein transcripts were over-expressed in fibroblasts containing mutated nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, in agreement with our observations in a <dig> ρ <dig> cell cultures  <cit> . thus, results from multiple laboratories testing different ρ <dig> cell cultures support the assertion that our current analyses at least partially reflect mtdna-dependent gene expression relevant to multiple cell types. future gene expression profiling experiments of mtdna-depleted cells generated using non-chemical-based protocols, such as expressing sirna against the tfam gene  <cit>  or a dominant negative form of the mitochondria-specific dna polymerase-gamma  <cit> , could provide valuable empirical data to assess our candidate mtdna-dependent gene expression profiles. ultimately, large-scale proteomic characterization of mtdna-depleted and parental cells will be necessary to rigorously assess possible functional consequences of differential gene expression  <cit> .

contribution of growth conditions to gene expression profiles
next, we calculated the relative fraction of the variance associated with growth conditions in the gene expression profiles from ρ <dig> and parental cells grown in culture and in xenografts. at first, we focused on those transcripts for which over 50% of the variance  could be explained by growth conditions and where there was differential expression in any of the pair-wise comparisons of ρ <dig> and parental a <dig> cells grown in culture or in xenograft. overall, we uncovered  <dig>  transcripts that met these criteria. in order to reduce transcript complexity, we focused on the subset of  <dig> transcripts  where growth conditions contributed to a robust 90% of the variance observed in the data set . table  <dig> lists a subset of these transcripts where at least 97% of the variance in gene expression was dependent upon mtdna status.

of the go categories enriched for transcripts whose expression was highly dependent upon growth conditions, only the nuclear rna splicing go category  were more abundant in xenografts relative to cultured cells . however, multiple go categories were enriched for transcripts whose variance was principally explained by growth conditions and were less abundant in xenografts relative to cell culture. these included categories related to mitochondrial function , glycolysis , electron carrier activity , purine metabolism , and the proteosome core complex  .

the decrease in mitochondrial transcripts encoded by the nuclear genome may relate to the relative oxygen deprivation in xenografts relative to cell culture which would cause cells to rely less upon oxidative phosphorylation for their energy needs. the fact that growth conditions play a larger role in the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes than the presence of the mitochondrial genome is not surprising if one considers the fact that ρ <dig> cells form mitochondrial structures in the absence of mtdna. furthermore, this is consistent with observations that there are no differences in the expression of nuclear-encoded oxidative phosphorylation genes in parental and mtdna-deficient osteosarcoma cells  <cit> . interestingly, we could not detect differential transcript levels of nuclear encoded mtdna polymerase , previously reported to be decreased on the protein level in hela ρ <dig> cells  <cit> , in any pair-wise comparison of experimental grouping performed in this study. however, we did find growth conditions accounted for 73% of the variance in gene expression  of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial rna polymerase polrmt, which was reported to be down-regulated on the protein level in response to mtdna depletion in hela cells  <cit> .

the above observations, also supported by kegg  pathway analyses of the same group of transcripts , indicate that both glycolysis and aerobic respiration-related genes are less abundant in xenografts relative to culture. this could relate to the cells being cultured in glucose-rich medium that does not reflect the situation found in vivo. in combination, decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in xenografts reflects lower energetic demands in vivo. likewise, the decreased abundance of transcripts related to purine metabolism in xenografts is likely related to slower growth rates in xenografts relative to culture. decreased purine metabolism could also reflect the absence of the super-physiological levels of glutamine present in cell culture media.

role of mtdna mutations in human disorders
a <dig> lung cancer cells provide an appealing model system to study mitochondrial function due to their ability to be grown in culture and in tumor xenografts. the potential role of mitochondrial function in cancer was first recognized by otto warburg when he observed that cancer cells show a characteristic shift in energy production from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis  <cit> . more recently, there has been increasing appreciation of the possible importance of inherited and somatic mtdna mutations in cancer  <cit> . based on the gene expression profiles observed in this study, ρ <dig> xenograft tumor models could be of particular interest in determining mtdna-mediated responses to specific cancer therapies, such anti-angiogenic agents.

in addition, ρ <dig> cells play a critical role in the production of cybrid  cell lines containing specific mutations in mtdna. while multiple groups have used this elegant system to study mitochondrial function in cultured cells , only recently have these cybrids been used in tumor xenografts  <cit> . gene expression profiling of such cybrids both in culture and in xenografts could provide valuable data to elucidate further the functional interactions between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
although growth conditions had a greater influence on gene expression profiles than the presence of active mitochondria, we identified mtdna-dependent gene expression profiles that are shared in cultured a <dig> cells and in xenografts. these profiles indicate that cells with mtdna alterations have distinct biochemical properties that make them well-suited for elucidating responses to physiological perturbations, such as changes in oxygen and glucose levels, and testing the effects of specialized classes of chemotherapeutic agents. in addition, our studies suggest that gene expression profiling of mtdna-depleted cells grown culture and in xenografts provide powerful means to investigate possible relationships between mitochondrial activity and gene expression profiles in normal and pathological cells.
