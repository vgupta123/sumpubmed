BACKGROUND
in the pre-genomic era, genes were identified and sequenced in a heuristic manner to address specific biological questions. after a long period of such heuristic exploration, many genes are now comprehensively identified as parts of genomic sequences determined in large-scale projects. with several relatively well-assembled genome sequences both for teleost fishes and tetrapods, one might expect that we have discovered almost all genes commonly possessed by vertebrates . this should be proven with care, however, especially for gene families whose members were identified and functionally characterized intensively in the very early phase of development of molecular biology. this caution is emphasized when we take into account a generalized view that diverse species possess similar gene repertoires, for well-characterized gene families, such as those containing many regulatory genes involved in animal development, namely 'toolkit genes' , such as hox genes  <cit> .

one of those is a group of genes containing vertebrate bone morphogenetic proteins   <dig>  bmp <dig>  and fly decapentaplegic  genes. these genes are members of the transforming growth factor  β superfamily, which encode proteins that are cleaved to be active extracellular signaling ligands  <cit> . the tgfβ superfamily contains other genes encoding signal proteins, such as bmp2- <dig>  growth differentiation factors , tgfβ, inhibins and activins . in vertebrates, bmp <dig> and - <dig> are involved in various developmental processes, such as axial patterning, tissue specification and organogenesis . in particular, there are several pioneering studies that highlighted the importance of this group of genes in understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie morphological changes during evolution .

in this study, we identified an uncharacterized relative of bmp2/ <dig> genes that is possessed only by teleost genomes, and designated it bmp <dig>  although additional gene repertoires unique to teleost fishes are often explained by the teleost-specific genome duplication , our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested that this gene diverged early in vertebrate evolution and is equidistant to both bmp <dig> and - <dig> . it should therefore be regarded as one of the duplicates that was generated early in vertebrate evolution, whose ortholog was lost in the lineage leading to the amniotes. through analyzing expression patterns of the zebrafish bmp <dig> gene, we propose possible scenarios that may explain the evolution of gene repertoires and functions.

RESULTS
in silico identification of a novel bmp2/ <dig> homolog in teleost genomes
a local blastp search using the human bmp <dig> gene as a query against downloaded available ensembl peptide sequences for all vertebrate species produced high similarity to a group of uncharacterized peptide sequences for teleost fishes , which was later designated 'bmp16'. the search against ensembl peptide sequences didn't find any possible ortholog to this gene for medaka, but its genome assembly contained a significantly similar unannotated sequence on chromosome  <dig>  at nucleotide positions 13805647- <dig> . for this putative medaka bmp <dig> ortholog, we also found transcript sequences, derived from embryonic cdna libraries, in ncbi dbest  that have identical sequences to this genomic region and show high similarity to bmp <dig> of other teleost fishes. including medaka, all five model teleost fish species with whole sequenced genomes possess a single bmp <dig> gene. we detected some amino acids shared only among teleost bmp <dig> sequences, but overall sequences in the mature tgfβ ligand domain, which is located at the c-terminus, were highly conserved between bmp <dig> and other tgfβ subtypes .

structural properties of bmp16
by means of rt-pcr, we amplified 5' and 3' cdna fragments of the zebrafish bmp <dig> . by assembling the two cdna fragments, we obtained a contiguous cdna sequence containing a small fraction of 5' utr, full protein-coding region and a full 3' utr, which was submitted to embl nucleotide sequence database under the accession number . in an alignment between two predicted transcript sequences currently available in ensembl  and our assembled bmp <dig> cdna, we found distinct differences in nucleotide sequences, probably due to putative mis-annotation of exons in the ensembl entries .

we then aligned our cdna with genomic dna sequences retrieved from ensembl, to find out correct exon-intron boundaries . it turned out that the differences between our and predicted ensembl transcripts originates partly from an incorrect assembly of genomic sequences, which is verified by our pcr amplification of the corresponding genomic region . our genomic sequence was also submitted to embl nucleotide sequence database under the accession number .

in the deduced amino acid sequences of bmp <dig>  it was found that six amino acid residues, out of nine that for human bmp <dig> interact with its receptor  <cit> , are rigidly conserved between all teleost fishes analyzed here .

in silico scan for locations of the bmp <dig> gene in the genomes of teleost fishes, except zebrafish, highlighted its linkage with leucine-rich repeat containing   <dig>  gem-associated protein   <dig>  splicing factor arginine/serine-rich   <dig>  reticulon   <dig> and relb genes in a approximately 500-kb long genomic stretch . in the human genome, their orthologs were found tightly clustered in a genomic stretch with a similar size on chromosome  <dig> .

molecular phylogenetic analyses: in or out?
our molecular phylogenetic analysis including the entire tgfβ superfamily for fly, amphioxus and human, suggested a high affinity of bmp <dig> to bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> . this is consistent with the observation that, in the multiple alignment, some amino acids were exclusively shared between bmp <dig> and bmp2/ <dig> . although this overall tree placed the bmp <dig> gene outside the bmp2/ <dig> group , a restricted phylogenetic analysis based on the maximum-likelihood  method with bmp <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and their phylogenetic neighbors provided a robust support for placement of bmp <dig> inside or basal to the bilaterian bmp2/ <dig> group . in this tree, bmp <dig> genes cluster with teleost bmp2a/2b genes. however, the statistical support for this grouping is low . we then constructed a more focused molecular phylogeny on bmp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  with more available sequences , including those of non-model vertebrate species, such as the sea lamprey  for which three bmp2/ <dig> homologues were already reported  <cit>  . importantly, unlike the previous tree inferences , this analysis allowed the employment of the amino acid alignment outside the tgfβ ligand domain that are conserved only within the bmp2/ <dig> subfamily . the ml method supported the tree topology where bmp <dig> is clustering with one of the sea lamprey genes . in this tree, bmp <dig> is more closely related to bmp16/pmbmps than to bmp <dig>  but the statistical support is not high .

to assess alternative scenarios for the origin of bmp <dig>  we conducted an exhaustive ml analysis with seven operational taxonomic units  . out of all  <dig> possible tree topologies, eight tree topologies including the ml tree have been revealed to be within 1σ of log-likelihood difference . the consensus topology of these eight tree topologies is shown in figure 5a. tree topologies suggesting scenarios where all gene duplications giving rise to bmp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> occurred after the lamprey-gnathostome split  were not supported with high statistical confidence, nor the scenario that gene duplications giving rise to bmp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> occurred before the lamprey-gnathostome split .

aall  <dig> tree topologies were sorted by Δlogl/se. abbreviations: bmp <dig>  gnathostome bmp2; bmp <dig>  gnathostome bmp4; bmp <dig>  teleost bmp16; pma, p. marinus pmbmp2/4-a; pmb, p. marinus pmbmp2/4-b; pmc, p. marinus pmbmp2/4-c; out, outgroup; se, standard error of Δlogl; rell bp, probability based on resampling of estimated log-likelihoods ; bpp, bayesian posterior probability; au, approximate unbiased test; sh, shimodaira-hasegawa test. for tree topologies supporting scenarios hypothesized in figure 5b and 5c, only those with the largest likelihood are shown, respectively.

gene expression analysis of bmp16
to characterize expression patterns of the zebrafish bmp <dig> gene, we performed in situ hybridization for embryos spanning from  <dig> hours post fertilization  to  <dig> days post fertilization . expression was not detected prior to early segmentation stages and was first clearly evident at  <dig> hpf in the primordium of the median fin fold, where expression remained detectable until  <dig> hpf . by  <dig> hpf, bmp <dig> is expressed in a region of the tail bud mesenchyme that dorsally and caudally flanks the midline precursor cells, i.e. the chordoneural hinge, in a crescent shaped domain . its caudalmost expression is in dorsal cells that form the neural keel, with stronger expression towards the center of the neural keel cells . more anteriorly, bmp <dig> transcripts are localized to the inner extremities of the cells in the neural rod . lower levels of expression are found in cells of the emerging midline structures  <cit>  . bmp <dig> is also expressed in the developing heart, where it was detected from  <dig> hpf onwards and with strong expression in both chambers at  <dig> hpf .

between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf, bmp <dig> is expressed in the apical ectodermal fold, a specialized epithelial structure homologous to the tetrapod apical ectodermal ridge , of the pectoral fins . around  <dig> hpf, bmp <dig> also starts to be expressed in a region of the midline endoderm at the level of the anterior extent of the pectoral fins . to better characterize these cells we compared bmp <dig> expression with that of the marker for the dorsal pancreatic bud, islet- <dig> , and found that bmp <dig> localizes to endodermal cells at the boundary between somites  <dig> and  <dig>  while isl- <dig> is expressed slightly more caudally at the somite 3- <dig> boundary . at  <dig> hpf, bmp <dig> expression continues to align with the midline , and by  <dig> hpf is found in an additional, more anterior patch of cells that is associated with the foregut endoderm, whereas the posterior expression domain marks the developing swim bladder  <cit>  . accordingly, at  <dig> dpf bmp <dig> is strongly expressed in the swim bladder as well as in the gut epithelium .

discussion
timings of gene duplications between bmp <dig>  - <dig> and -16
since the teleost-specific genome duplication was first proposed, many genes unique to teleost genomes have been attributed to this event. this event per se is one of the best systems to characterize the evolutionary impact of whole genome duplications  <cit> . however, our finding of the novel bmp <dig> genes unique to teleost genomes does not align with this framework. all teleost genomes examined so far have a single ortholog  to tetrapod bmp <dig>  while two bmp <dig> orthologs  are found in the zebrafish. notably, our molecular phylogenetic analyses did not place the bmp <dig> into either of bmp <dig> or bmp <dig> subfamilies . instead, the closer relationship of bmp <dig> to three lamprey bmp2/ <dig> homologs was supported . based on statistical evaluation of likelihood values, we conclude that the origin of bmp <dig> dates back to the earliest phase of vertebrate evolution. despite our additional attempt to characterize the timing of the gene duplication by comparing gene order in the flanking genomic regions  between teleost bmp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  no convincing evidence for chromosomal duplications and their timings was obtained, probably because of frequent chromosomal rearrangements in their adjacent genomic regions . overall, our analysis favors the scenario that all the gene duplications giving rise to bmp <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> occurred before the cyclostome-gnathostome split. if these three subtypes are products of the so-called two-round whole genome duplications, their timing is consistent with an emerging hypothesis that the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates already experienced these events  <cit> .

according to a previous study, the coverage of the available sea lamprey genome sequences should be sufficient for detecting at least one exon for any given gene  <cit> --consistently, fragments of the previously reported three sea lamprey bmp2/ <dig> homologs were detected. additionally, our effort to survey publicly available sea lamprey genomic and transcriptomic sequences failed to detect additional cyclostome bmp2/4/ <dig> homologs. therefore, after our identification of bmp <dig>  both the lamprey and gnathostomes possess three bmp2/4/16-related homologs. however, the most parsimonious phylogenetic scenario that postulates the smallest number of secondary gene duplications and losses  was significantly rejected . if we assume the topology of the ml tree in figure  <dig> to be correct, it suggests that only p. marinus bmp2/4-a is the genuine ortholog of bmp <dig>  and that the gnathostome ortholog for p. marinus bmp2/4-b and -c was secondarily lost in its early evolution. accordingly, we should also assume that cyclostome orthologs for gnathostome bmp <dig> and/or bmp <dig> are unidentified or secondarily lost. in the light of low statistical support for the ml tree, we cannot rule out other similar hypotheses . however, with the currently available dataset and traditional framework of molecular phylogenetics, the scenario for gene duplications and retentions of duplicates during early vertebrate evolution seems to be much more complicated than previously reported  <cit> . gene sampling for other early vertebrates will be a future task. in particular, the group of hagfishes, which diverged from the future lamprey lineage just after the cyclostome-gnathostome split  <cit> , might provide information for resolving deep divergence of bmp <dig> from others.

bmp2/4/ <dig> gene repertoires: teleost fishes and tetrapods
as well as between gnathostomes and the lamprey, our analysis has highlighted the contrast of gene repertoires between teleosts and tetrapods. in any tetrapod species for which whole genome sequences are available, bmp <dig> orthologs have not been found. the absence of this gene in the entire taxon tetrapoda was also confirmed by our intensive survey of ests in ncbi. judging from the maintenance of syntenic organization of genes surrounding the bmp <dig> gene even in species without its ortholog , the possible loss of this gene doesn't seem to have involved deletion of a large genomic portion. the most parsimonious explanation is that the bmp <dig> ortholog was lost from the genome in a small-scale event once at the basal lineage of tetrapods. a careful scan of sarcopterygian fish genomes  could narrow the time range of the gene loss.

another interesting observation is that even though the zebrafish genome contains two bmp <dig> orthologs , other model teleost fishes categorized in acanthomorpha seem to possess only one, namely bmp2b . our additional survey in all available est sequences for acanthomorpha did not detect any more unidentified bmp <dig> relative. this suggests that bmp2a is confined to at least some of species in otocephala , and the bmp2a ortholog was secondarily lost in the lineage leading to acanthomorpha. this line of evidence for gene losses underlines an importance of elaborate comparisons of gene repertoires even between relatively closely related animals. it is likely that more 'toolkit' genes involved in vertebrate development, which are normally considered to be present universally in all relevant genomes, are revealed to have experienced this type of evolutionary change, as shown in some previous studies .

roles of bmp <dig> during zebrafish embryogenesis: did redundancy permit the loss?
in contrast to the divergent nature of bmp <dig> from other bmp2/ <dig> members, the deduced amino acid sequences of bmp <dig> genes seem to be relatively conserved among teleosts, especially within acanthomorpha . we confirmed transcription of this uncharacterized gene in zebrafish with rt-pcr and in situ hybridization, and in medaka with a survey of publicly available ests. these data, together with the conservation of the majority of amino acid residues that are crucial for recognition by the bmp type i receptor  <cit> , suggest that bmp <dig> functions as an active ligand in the tgfβ signaling pathway in particular biological processes.

our analysis revealed bmp <dig> expressions in several different tissues and cell types during zebrafish embryogenesis, some of which are known to express other members of the tgfβ superfamily in tetrapods. in light of our molecular phylogenetic evidence of the loss of the bmp <dig> ortholog in the tetrapod lineage, one can ask whether its original functions might have been taken over by other members of the tgfβ superfamily in the tetrapods.

this assumption holds true for pectoral fins, because in addition to bmp2b and bmp <dig>  <cit> , several other bmp genes  are co-expressed in the zebrafish apical ectodermal fold. in addition, expression of bmp2a, bmp2b, bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> is up-regulated in the epithelium of the developing caudal fin fold  <cit> . the aer of tetrapod limbs also expresses a number of bmp genes . therefore, individual bmp subtypes are likely to act in a redundant fashion. the loss of the bmp <dig> ortholog in the tetrapod ancestor might have been compensated in the developing specialized epithelia of median fins and paired appendages by a redundancy of bmp gene function in these tissues.

similarly, bmp2b and bmp <dig>  as well as bmp <dig>  are commonly expressed in the developing zebrafish heart  <cit> . possible deleterious effects associated with the loss of the bmp <dig> ortholog in the tetrapod lineage could eventually have been compensated by the expression of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  and the recruitment of additional homologs along with the evolution of an advanced chambering system. accordingly, tetrapods not only express bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> during heart development, but also bmp <dig> and bmp <dig>  <cit> .

because the swim bladder and mammalian lungs share a common evolutionary origin  <cit> , it is likely that their development is controlled by shared regulatory pathways. in the mouse, bmp <dig> is expressed during lung development where it is initially found at high levels in the lung buds, followed by expression in the distal epithelial tips and with lower levels in the adjacent mesenchyme  <cit> . bmp <dig> promotes the development of distal epithelial cell types at the expense of proximal cell types  <cit> . accordingly, the proximal lung epithelium expresses the bmp <dig> antagonist, gremlin <dig>  which determines proximal lung epithelial cell fate through inhibition of bmp signaling. by regulating the proliferation, survival and morphogenetic activity of distal lung epithelial cells, bmp signaling plays an essential role in lung morphogenesis  <cit> .

in zebrafish, it has been shown that signaling through bmp2a/2b regulates the decision between hepatic versus pancreatic fate in the endodermal midline  <cit> . bmp signaling in adjacent lateral plate mesodermal tissues patterns the endoderm through direct contact, as disruption of coordinated cell movements between these tissues causes patterning defects in the endoderm and ceased proliferation and apoptosis of cells in the liver primordium that results from a failure of bmp2a expressing cells to properly contact the endoderm  <cit> .

comparably little is known about the roles of bmps during swim bladder development. however, in the zebrafish, the swim bladder expresses the protein related to dan and cerberus  gene , which encodes an antagonist of signaling through bmp2a/2b and bmp <dig>  <cit> . it will therefore be interesting to see whether bmp <dig> and prdc play comparable antagonistic roles during swim bladder development like bmp4/gremlin <dig> in the mouse lung.

interestingly, we observed bmp <dig> expression in the tail bud between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. although bmp2a and bmp <dig> are transiently expressed in a broad domain of the caudal trunk-forming mesoderm after the end of gastrulation  <cit> , neither gene is expressed at late stages of somitogenesis. due to its dynamic expression in the developing neural keel, it is possible that bmp <dig> plays a role during the ongoing neurulation process in the tail, a process that probably also involves bmp7a  <cit> . its expression in the zebrafish tail may correspond to that in the apical surface of the neural tube in tetrapods. in the mouse embryo, bmp <dig> together with bmp <dig>  are expressed in the surface ectoderm overlying the neural folds  <cit> . faure et al. showed that smad- <dig>  which transduces bmp signaling, is activated in cells of the opened neural tube as well as in the ectodermal cells covering the neural folds in 10-day mouse embryos, i.e. during neurulation of the trunk region  <cit> . these observations support the idea that bmp <dig> in teleosts and bmp <dig> and - <dig> in the mouse may serve similar functions during tail neurulation. interestingly, the zebrafish bmp <dig> is expressed in partially overlapping domains with notch1b and notch <dig> in the tail bud mesenchyme that forms the neural rod during segmentation stages  <cit> . it has been shown that ectopic expression of bmp <dig> in the xenopus tail bud leads to the formation of an extra tail-like outgrowth  <cit> . the formation of a neural tube in this structure is notch signaling-dependent  <cit> . it will therefore be of interest to define the possible genetic interactions that might exist between these signaling pathways during caudal neural keel development in the zebrafish.

shuffling of expression domains among bmp2/4/ <dig> genes
the bmp <dig> expression patterns, scrutinized above from the developmental point of view, can also be dissected from the phylogenetic point of view to shed light on how embryonic expressions for this group of genes have been shuffled during vertebrate evolution. as for the swim bladder-associated expression of bmp <dig> , our observation is the first evidence of involvement of a member of the tgfβ superfamily in its development. while neither zebrafish bmp2a/2b nor bmp <dig> are currently known to be expressed in the developing swim bladder  <cit> , a focused analysis on their expression patterns in the developing endoderm at the time of swim bladder formation might be required to determine whether or not one of these genes is involved in this process. this should reveal whether other members of the bmp2/4/ <dig> subfamily that duplicated prior to the evolution of the swim bladder were recruited for its development. nonetheless, as described above, mouse bmp <dig> is expressed in the developing lung, which is a homologous structure to the swim bladder  <cit> . so far, there is no report of lung-associated expression for bmp <dig> or - <dig> genes in non-mammalian vertebrates. although this might be a result of recent lineage-specific recruitment of paralogous genes in the morphogenesis of homologous structures, this endodermal expression might have already been possessed by the ancestral gene before the split of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> genes.

in contrast, bmp <dig> and - <dig> expression in fin/limb buds, heart and tail bud, where zebrafish bmp <dig> is expressed , are found in a more taxonomically broad set of vertebrates . it is highly likely that bmp <dig> expression in those tissues was inherited from the ancestral bmp2/4/ <dig> gene, with some lineage-specific exceptions in which some expression domains are absent .

on the other hand, zebrafish bmp <dig> expression is absent in many of the tissues where bmp <dig> and/or - <dig> are frequently expressed, such as in the central nervous system, otic vesicle, olfactory placode, neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme . moreover, the zebrafish bmp <dig> was not expressed in pre-gastrulation stages in which bmp <dig> and - <dig> are expressed in the ventral mesoderm to regulate dorsoventral axis specification  <cit> . this implies that after the gene duplication between bmp <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  bmp <dig> expression was secondarily lost in those tissues, and was instead recruited for swim bladder development.

even though in the molecular phylogenetic trees bmp <dig> is placed more closely to sea lamprey bmp2/ <dig> homologs than to jawed-vertebrate bmp2/ <dig> , a direct comparison of expression patterns between them shows that the only expression domain they have in common is the heart   <cit> . in addition to the heart, pmbmp2/4a is expressed in a wide variety of tissues where bmp2/ <dig> expression is usually observed in bony vertebrates, while pmbmp2/4b and -c expression is restricted to branchial arches  <cit> . in exploring the evolutionary history of bmp2/4/ <dig> expression patterns, this deviation in expression patterns of the sea lamprey homologs prevents us from drawing a clear-cut scenario--it would not be so surprising if early-branching lineages have accumulated a considerable number of secondary changes . information for missing early-branching lineages  might provide more clues about whether the variety of expression patterns originates from  frequent lineage-specific losses of expression domains from an ancestral template with a full set of domains, or  independent gains of similar expression domains in different lineages.

CONCLUSIONS
our scan in a public genome database identified a novel bmp2/ <dig> relative, bmp <dig>  confined to teleost fish genomes. we suggest that this gene duplicated from bmp <dig> and - <dig> early in vertebrate evolution, and that the absence of the tetrapod ortholog is due to the secondary loss in its basal lineage. this loss might have been permitted by the redundant expression patterns shared with other bmp subtypes in fin folds, heart, and tail bud, seen in the zebrafish. at the same time, this gene was revealed to be expressed in the swim bladder, which so far has not been shown to express any other bmp homolog. our study demonstrates the power of bioinformatic, phylogenetic approaches to newly identify unexplored genes responsible for crucial biological processes. in particular, an importance of making a similar type of efforts for other gene families to document unidentified genes and secondary changes of their expression patterns is underlined.
