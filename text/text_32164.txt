BACKGROUND
the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family of proteins is highly conserved and is found in bacteria, archaea and eukarya, and has recently been discovered in plants  <cit> . despite their ubiquity, no function for any member of the class has been clearly defined, although evidence has been obtained which suggests that, at least in certain microbes, there is a link with isoleucine metabolism  <cit> . all members of the class studied in detail are homotrimeric with subunits of 120– <dig> amino acids in length. the structures of several yjgf family members have been determined, the first two of which were published in  <dig>  namely yjgf from escherichia coli  <cit>  and yabj from bacillus subtilis  <cit> . these structures revealed a cavity, located at the subunit interfaces and decorated by seven totally conserved amino acids within the family  <cit> . this finding immediately suggested that this cavity could represent a binding site for a substrate or ligand. indeed, the site of substitution for the mercury derivative used to solve the structure of yabj was cys- <dig>  a reasonably well-conserved residue that lines this pocket. in total, the structures of  <dig> homologues have now been deposited in the protein data bank  and these are summarised in table  <dig>  only one of which shows a biologically significant ligand bound in this site. this is the structure of the human protein hp <dig>   <cit> , which contains at least one benzoic acid molecule per site forming bi-dentate interactions between its carboxylate moiety and the guanidinium group of the strictly conserved arg- <dig>  this structure contains three trimers per asymmetric unit and four of the nine possible sites also show an additional, weakly bound, benzoic acid molecule adjacent to the first, oriented in one of two possible conformations. it is notable that these crystals were obtained in the presence of  <dig>  m sodium benzoate, and thus the biological relevance of this interaction may be questionable.

recently, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the hi <dig> protein from h. influenzae  <cit>  revealed that 2-ketobutyrate and analogues of its cognate enamine, interacted with this cavity, suggesting that at least some of these proteins might bind keto acids. this finding supports a number of in vivo observations, which have pointed towards a role for some family members in l-isoleucine metabolism  <cit> .

during isoleucine biosynthesis l-threonine is deaminated to 2-ketobutyrate by the ilva protein. in yeast a mutation in one of the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family paralogues results in isoleucine auxotrophy and impaired mitochondrial maintenance  <cit> . in salmonella enterica strong evidence has been provided  <cit>  that shows when the yjgf gene is mutated, the specific activity of the final enzyme  on the biosynthetic pathway to l-isoleucine is significantly reduced, suggesting that yjgf acts at a post-translational level in controlling ilve activity. more recent data  <cit>  reaffirm the conclusion that yjgf interacts with a specific metabolite. taken together, these data suggest that at least some members of this large family of proteins might act as sensors of cellular 2-ketobutyrate levels. accumulation of 2-ketobutyrate results in toxicity towards cells and this has been proposed to result from competition with 2-ketoisovalerate, which is a precursor in coenzyme a biosynthesis  <cit> . consequently, cells may well have evolved a mechanism for sensing 2-ketobutyrate levels and altering metabolism to degrade this potentially toxic intermediate.

degradation of 2-ketobutyrate to propionate occurs via propionyl-coa and propionyl-phosphate intermediates with the generation of atp  <cit>  . this pathway is analogous to the fermentative metabolism of acetyl-coa. in enteric bacteria, coenzyme a-dependent cleavage of 2-ketobutyrate can occur both aerobically via pyruvate dehydrogenase and anaerobically via the glycyl radical enzyme pyruvate formate-lyase. escherichia coli also has a dedicated pathway for the anaerobic degradation of l-threonine or l-serine that is encoded by the tdc operon  <cit>  . the sixth gene of the tdc operon encodes a protein, tdcf, that is a member of the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family. the location of this gene within the tdc operon is strongly suggestive of a role in the degradation of 2-ketobutyrate. however, all enzymic steps on this pathway can be accounted for by other enzymes encoded within the tdc operon, together with phosphotransacetylase  <cit> , suggesting that tdcf might have a different function related to 2-ketobutyrate metabolism. in this study, we present crystal structures of tdcf in complex with a variety of ligands, most notably 2-ketobutyrate.

RESULTS
structure determination of tdcf
the first crystal structure of tdcf was determined at  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement using the structure of the paralogue yjgf  <cit>  as a template, as described previously  <cit> . there is one homotrimer per asymmetric unit, with the subunits tightly packed together around a non-crystallographic three-fold axis, as a result burying around  <dig> Å <dig> of accessible surface per monomer, as estimated by the protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies  server  <cit> . the trimer resembles an oblate spheroid with a pole-to-pole distance of approximately  <dig> Å and an equatorial diameter of approximately  <dig> Å . as expected, the tdcf structure is closely similar to those of the other yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family members that have been determined previously, with root-mean-square-displacements  in cα positions not exceeding  <dig>  Å after superposition . as the fold has been described extensively elsewhere  <cit>  only brief details will be given here. each  <dig> kda subunit comprises a single domain that contains a predominantly anti-parallel, six-stranded β-sheet against which are packed two short α-helices. the connecting loops on the outer surface of the trimer are long in comparison to the loops positioned at the centre of the protein, which are much shorter and tighter. the core of the trimer contains a triangular barrel-like structure, which is formed from twelve β-strands, with four donated from each monomer . this central cavity is filled with some  <dig> ordered water molecules. the six α-helices, two per subunit, decorate the periphery of the molecule.

the most significant structural features are the three symmetry-related solvent-accessible clefts, located at the interfaces between pair of subunits, close to the "equator" of the trimer. the clustering of well-conserved amino acids in and around these sites strongly suggests that they are functionally important. the three sites, which we shall refer to as sites a, b and c, are not crystallographically equivalent, and are thus subject to different crystal packing environments, with site a being the most occluded by neighbouring trimers, and site c being the most solvent exposed.

the binding of ethylene glycol
the original  <dig>  Å resolution as-isolated x-ray data set was collected at  <dig> k using a cryoprotectant solution containing 20%  ethylene glycol. during model building and refinement, it became apparent that whilst the electron density in site a was consistent with ordered water molecules, a more substantial region of elongated density was present in both sites b and c. this could be modelled convincingly as a single ethylene glycol molecule in each of the two sites making a single hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain of arg- <dig> . it was noted that the central part of the loop connecting β <dig> and β <dig>  which delineates one side of the cleft and bears the conserved residue tyr- <dig>  had elevated temperature factors, with ile- <dig> being poorly defined in the electron density maps. this was especially true for the loop adjacent to site a, which adopted a slightly more open conformation with respect to the loops in sites b and c that were partially closed over the ligand . only one other structure of a yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> homologue, that of tm <dig>  from thermotoga maritima, reports the use of ethylene glycol; although three molecules were resolved in this structure, they were all bound at surface sites away from the conserved ligand-binding pocket. since ethylene glycol makes only a single hydrogen bond with tdcf, it is likely that it binds with low affinity, and it is only seen in the structure because of its high concentration in the cryoprotectant.

the binding of a hydroxy amino acid
in all subsequent x-ray data collections, to preclude competition between ethylene glycol and any potential ligands for tdcf, ethylene glycol was substituted with peg  <dig> in the cryoprotectant solution. a data set was collected to  <dig>  Å resolution without the addition of any ligand, in order to visualise the structure of ligand-free tdcf. to our surprise, however, site c was clearly occupied by something other than water molecules. given the resolution and quality of the electron density, it was possible to place atoms into the density with some confidence. indeed, a good fit was achieved with a threonine residue, with the carboxylate making a bi-dentate salt-bridge to the side-chain of arg- <dig>  the amino group hydrogen-bonding to the carbonyl oxygen of arg- <dig>  and the hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonding to both the amino group and the carbonyl oxygen of cys- <dig>  as well as to the side-chain of glu- <dig>  however, the density for the side-chain of the threonine was noticeably weaker than for the rest of the residue and the temperature factors were marginally higher for these atoms after refinement. an alternative interpretation, with serine as the ligand with its side-chain in two alternative conformations of equal occupancy, gave a slightly better fit . moreover, the second side-chain conformation provides an additional hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of gly- <dig>  although a fully ligand-free tdcf structure was not obtained, this model did provide details of a vacant pocket  at high resolution .

the binding of 2-ketobutyrate
a further data set was collected to  <dig>  Å resolution, this time from a crystal soaked in  <dig> mm ketobutyrate. the resultant electron density maps showed clear density for a 2-ketobutyrate ligand in each of the three binding sites . as with the serine ligand, the carboxylate moiety of 2-ketobutyrate makes a bi-dentate salt-bridge to the side-chain of arg- <dig>  whilst the keto group forms two hydrogen bonds, one with the amino group of cys- <dig>  and the other with the carboxyl group of glu- <dig>  however, in order to provide a hydrogen for the latter interaction, the ligand would need to bind in the less stable enol form . the significance of this observation is not clear at present. curiously, there is a water molecule adjacent to the 2-ketobutyrate on the re-face of the enol moiety and approximately  <dig>  Å from c <dig> 

the binding of propionate and other ligands
after soaking a crystal in  <dig> mm propionate, x-ray data to  <dig>  Å resolution were collected. sites b and c were clearly occupied with a ligand, and a propionate molecule could be placed with confidence in both. again, the carboxylate group was salt-bridged to arg- <dig> .

soaking experiments were also performed using l-threonine and l-serine, and data sets to  <dig>  Å resolution were subsequently collected. in both cases, an area of positive difference electron density was present in site c that could be consistent with an amino acid, but further interpretation was not possible due to the poor resolution and quality of the data . a crystal soaked in propionyl-coa did not survive the process, raising the possibility that the specific binding of this ligand induces a conformational change that disrupts the crystal lattice. unfortunately, limited crystal availability precluded further soaking experiments.

roles of the conserved residues
members of the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family are characterised by seven totally conserved amino acids  <cit> , all of which line the inter-subunit ligand-binding pocket. these are tyr- <dig>  gly- <dig>  asn- <dig>  asn- <dig>  arg- <dig>  pro- <dig> and glu- <dig> . the importance of arg- <dig> is clear as it hydrogen-bonds to all ligands observed in the tdcf crystal structures, as well as to the benzoic acid moiety seen in the hp <dig>  structure  <cit> . glu- <dig> also forms key hydrogen bonds to the 2-ketobutyrate and to the putative serine ligand. in addition, glu- <dig> hydrogen-bonds to the main-chain carbonyl of residue  <dig> across the subunit interface and therefore may be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the pocket. asn- <dig> does not interact directly with any ligand, but may help to correctly orient arg- <dig> through two hydrogen bonds, and in so doing also help to maintain the structure of the pocket. tyr- <dig> and pro- <dig> form non-bonding interactions with the ligands, whilst gly- <dig> appears to be conserved purely on steric grounds: any residue with a side-chain would clash with other key residues, glu- <dig> in particular. the function of asn- <dig> is less clear as it lies some  <dig> Å away from the 2-ketobutyrate. it could play a role in mediating access to the pocket or may be involved in the binding of some other as yet unidentified ligand.

covalent modifications of tdcf
in the two structures determined at  <dig>  Å resolution, inspection of the fo-fc electron density maps showed that, in all copies of cys- <dig>  the sγ was surrounded by three peaks of positive density, that were too close to the atom to represent water molecules. this was modelled as a fully oxidised cysteine ie. cysteine sulfonic acid , which gave a good fit to the electron density after refinement . it was subsequently shown that cysteine sulfonic acid refined well at these positions in the two lower resolution structures as well. this modification is currently present in some  <dig> entries in the protein data bank but is likely to be present, though undetected, in other structures determined at medium to low resolution. the fact that the residue is fully oxidised suggests that it is unusually reactive, but since this modification is generally irreversible, it is most likely of no biological significance. furthermore, this residue is highly variable in the yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family, and it occurs in a surface loop of the protein, the sγ being approximately  <dig> Å away from the nearest 2-ketobutyrate.

a further modification was apparent at lys- <dig> in just the a chain of the 2-ketobutyrate-bound structure. this was modelled as a carboxylated lysine in two alternative conformations . this modification occurs in over one hundred pdb entries, and in some cases has a well-defined functional role, e.g. in coordinating a metal ion in the active centre of dihydropyrimidinase   <cit> . coincidentally, one occurrence of this modification is seen in the active site of transcarboxylase 5s subunit adjacent to a bound 2-ketobutyrate molecule   <cit> . although better conserved than cys- <dig>  this residue is located on the surface in helix  <dig> with its cα approximately  <dig> Å away from the nearest 2-ketobutyrate, and thus is unlikely to be functionally relevant. moreover, no evidence was seen for this modification in any of the other tdcf structures, although it is possible that this was not seen elsewhere due to disorder. neither the cys- <dig> nor the lys- <dig> modifications could be detected by mass spectroscopy on freshly prepared sample or dissolved crystals , which suggests that they may have arisen as artefacts after harvesting the crystals, and further supports the conclusion that they are not biologically important.

discussion
alignment of yjgf/yer057c/uk <dig> family members from different biological sources has identified seven totally conserved amino acid residues  <cit> . these conserved amino acids are found in a pocket located at the subunit interfaces of the trimer , and it has been suggested that they may form a substrate- or ligand-binding site. recently, using nmr spectroscopy and a ligand-screening approach parsons et al.  <cit>  identified six compounds that interacted with the hi <dig> protein from h. influenzae at, or near, this putative binding site. the ligand that showed the strongest interaction was 2-ketobutyrate , which is an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of l-isoleucine. some  <dig> residues were perturbed in the 15n-hsqc spectrum upon binding 2-ketobutyrate, but curiously these did not include the equivalents of residues arg- <dig> and glu- <dig>  in this study, we have demonstrated structurally that 2-ketobutyrate binds specifically to a new family member, tdcf from e. coli. all three ligand-binding sites were occupied in the crystal structure and the key residues identified to make hydrogen-bonding interactions with 2-ketobutyrate were arg- <dig> and glu- <dig>  both of which are highly conserved throughout the family. although the 2mfobs - dfcalc electron density maps for the side-chain of cys- <dig> were always clearly defined, showing a conformation directed away from the binding pocket , in most instances, there was some evidence in the difference electron density maps for one, or occasionally two, very minor alternate conformations directed either towards arg- <dig> or towards the site of ligand binding. in the latter cases, this would preclude ligand binding and thus indicate less than unit occupancy for the ligand. nevertheless, even in the vacant ligand-binding sites the predominant conformation was as shown in figure 3a. none of these alternate conformers was modelled in the structures. whether this residue has some role in mediating access to the pocket is not clear, but it is notable that the equivalent residue could not be clearly defined in the solution structure of hi <dig> from h. influenza, suggesting that it might also be able to adopt different conformations  <cit> . the corresponding cys- <dig> residue in the e. coli yjgf protein was observed to have a covalent modification that was proposed to be either thiosulphate or thiophosphate, perhaps also suggesting a role in ligand interaction  <cit> . indeed, the modified cys projects into the ligand-binding pocket of yjgf and hydrogen-bonds to arg- <dig>  in so doing, it overlaps the positions occupied by the ligands seen in the tdcf structures and thus could actually prevent ligand binding here . this position is occupied by a cysteine in only about half of the tdcf orthologues currently identified. notably, all of the orthologues predicted to bind 2-ketobutyrate or metabolites on the pathway to isoleucine biosynthesis . this was to be expected, since in the  <dig>  Å resolution as-isolated structure, both the sites associated with the b monomer are empty, whilst both are full in the 2-ketobutyrate-bound structure. the largest cα displacement of approximately  <dig> Å was for ile- <dig> in the β <dig> and β <dig> loop . recalculating the rmsd for monomer b with the exclusion of residues  <dig> –  <dig> inclusive, gave a much lower value of  <dig>  Å, indicating that the conformational changes are essentially restricted to the β <dig> – β <dig> loop. in general, this loop is poorly defined and more open for the ligand-free sites, whilst in the ligand-bound sites, it closes over the ligand and becomes more ordered.

in our initial structure of tdcf, the cryoprotectant ethylene glycol was shown to occupy two of the three binding sites, but this is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. subsequent experiments showed that propionate, l-serine and/or l-threonine could also occupy the binding sites. however, again not all of the binding sites were occupied. by contrast, full site occupancy was achieved using 2-ketobutyrate, indicating that it binds with higher affinity than the other ligands. taken together, these results strongly suggested that the subunit interface represents a binding site for a ligand or substrate that is an intermediate in the metabolism of l-threonine or l-serine. this is also in agreement with findings for other orthologues where it has been proposed that 2-ketobutyrate, or a metabolic derivative thereof, interacts with the binding site  <cit> .

we and others  <cit>  have analysed the ligand-binding pocket in detail, and through comparisons with other known structures have attempted to predict a catalytic function. although the fold of tdcf resembles that of chorismate mutase and the 2-ketobutyrate-binding pocket maps directly onto the active site of this enzyme, the important functional groups within the pocket are not conserved with this enzyme. in addition, some sequence similarity to 2-aminomuconate deaminases has been noted  <cit> , significantly, the equivalents of arg- <dig> and glu- <dig> being conserved, but when hi <dig> was tested for 2-aminomuconate deaminase activity, it proved to be inactive. the observation of a water molecule stacked against one face of the enol moiety of the 2-ketobutyrate is intriguing as it could take part in catalysis. in addition, the cluster of water molecules adjacent to the 2-ketobutyrate  could indicate a binding site for another substrate, or perhaps together with the space occupied by the 2-ketobutyrate, may represent the binding site for a much larger ligand. another possibility is that a cofactor binds adjacent to the 2-ketobutyrate. crude docking experiments with our tdcf structures suggest that a pyridoxal phosphate molecule could be accommodated, whilst thiamine pyrophosphate or coenzyme a  could not. nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that the latter two ligands induce large conformational changes that allow them to bind. however, investigations with hi <dig> showed that none of these cofactors induced chemical shifts in the 15n-hsqc spectrum of this protein  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the findings presented in this study strongly support the contention that 2-ketobutyrate is a physiological ligand recognised by tdcf. the tdcf gene is located in a multi-cistronic operon whose gene products have a role in the anaerobic degradation of l-threonine and l-serine. the first intermediate in the degradation of l-threonine or l-serine is the ketoacid, 2-ketobutyrate or pyruvate, respectively. pyruvate can be further metabolised via pyruvate formate-lyase or pyruvate dehydrogenase to acetyl-coa. 2-ketobutyrate can either be used as a substrate on the pathway to l-isoleucine or, under anaerobic conditions, can be metabolised to propionate via propionyl-coa and propionyl-p intermediates with concomitant generation of  <dig> atp . all the prerequisite enzymes for this fermentative route, with the exception of phosphotransacetylase are encoded by the tdc operon  <cit> . the only gene product of the operon whose function could not yet be assigned is tdcf. since to date no enzyme activity has been detected for any member of this protein family, we suggest, based on the current findings, that tdcf may be a post-translational regulator that controls the metabolic fate of l-threonine or the potentially toxic intermediate 2-ketobutyrate. depending on whether l-isoleucine is limiting or not for growth, tdcf, by sensing the levels of 2-ketobutyrate and forming a ternary complex with one or more of the enzymes of isoleucine biosynthesis or 2-ketobutyrate degradation, ensures that 2-ketobutyrate does not accumulate in the cell. experiments to determine putative protein-protein interaction partners of tdcf are in hand. a similar proposal for the function of the members of this protein family has been made previously  <cit> . this is consistent with the recent demonstration that yjgf appears to function at the post-translational level in controlling the activity of ilve, which catalyses the final transamination step on the l-isoleucine pathway in salmonella enterica  <cit> . the accumulation of 2-ketobutyrate has been proposed  <cit> , and genetically demonstrated  <cit> , to compete with 2-ketoisovalerate, the precursor of pantothenate synthesis, resulting in starvation for coenzyme a. metabolic poisoning by 2-ketobutyrate is prevented by its degradation aerobically via pyruvate dehydrogenase  <cit>  and anaerobically via pyruvate formate-lyase or tdce  <cit> ; these reactions are coa-dependent. this role of a sensor of 2-ketobutyrate would not only afford protection to cells from the toxic effects of 2-ketobutyrate accumulation and provide an additional means of energy generation, but also would ensure that sufficient 2-ketobutyrate was available for l-isoleucine biosynthesis.
