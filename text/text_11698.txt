BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus, a human commensal living on the skin and mucosa, can cause a broad range of infections including endocarditis, septicemia, skin infections, soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis. moreover, s. aureus is the leading cause of nosocomial infections  <cit> . the application of several new genotypic typing methods gave many new insights into the epidemiology and population structure of s. aureus  <cit> . recently, koreen et al. investigated a collection of  <dig> s. aureus isolates , which was recovered from  <dig> countries on four continents over a period of four decades as a representative of the breadth of diversity within s. aureus  <cit> . they used whole-genome micro-array analysis  as typing reference to evaluate the capability of several typing techniques, among them partial s. aureus protein a  gene sequencing. the spa repeat region consists of a variable number of 21– <dig> bp long repeats  varying in composition that result in different spa types.

previously it was shown that spa typing is fast, discriminatory, and very reproducible  <cit> . it was hypothesized by koreen and colleagues that by manual grouping of similar spa types this region contains evolutionary signals nearly comparable to whole-genome micro-array data  <cit> . until recently, however, no automated and objective algorithm existed to cluster different repeat regions. the based upon repeat pattern  implementation that is a heuristic variant of the newly described edsi algorithm  <cit> , was investigated in this study to infer the clonal relatedness of different spa types. we first calibrated the burp parameters using multilocus sequence typing  data from a representative strain collection as "gold standard" and then evaluated burp using the koreen et al. dataset.

methods
s. aureus strains  were used from our strain collection comprising  <dig> of the initial and most frequently to the spaserver reported spa types  <cit> . from these strains, mlst sequence types  were determined as previously  <cit> . sts that showed at least six of seven identical alleles were grouped into clonal complexes  using eburst  <cit> . burp – as implemented in the staphtype software v.  <dig>   – was used to cluster  spa types  <cit> . repeat-duplication and -excision in addition to substitution and base-insertion and -deletion events were taken into account when the relatedness of different spa types was calculated. burp offers two user-defined parameters that influence clustering: exclusion of spa types that are shorter than "x" repeats and the maximum number of costs "y" for clustering spa types into the same group. short spa types can be excluded from further analysis because their information content is limited and no reliable evolutionary history can be inferred. the costs account for the "steps" of evolution between two different spa types, whereas the algorithm tries to minimize these steps . to find out the optimal combination of these two parameters, clustering of all possible combinations of both parameters  was performed. a prerequisite was that the number of excluded spa types should be as low as possible and not exceed 10% of all investigated spa types. subsequently, the typing concordance  <cit>  between burp and eburst groupings were determined to elucidate the best parameter combination with the highest concordance on the one side and the lowest number of excluded spa types on the other. burp calibrated in this manner was finally used to cluster the strains from the study of koreen et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
in total, the  <dig> investigated strains exhibited  <dig> different sts. the eburst algorithm clustered the sts into  <dig> ccs  and  <dig> singletons . burp clustering of spa types using all possible parameter combinations and subsequent comparison with eburst ccs resulted in concordances ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. these concordances are illustrated in figure  <dig> using the visual-xsel  <dig>  software . to determine the optimal combination between the burp parameters, a graph showing the dependence of the concordance from the minimal repeat length of included spa types  for the different costs were drawn by ms excel xp. the overall highest concordance  lay on the cost value  <dig> curve . analyzing this curve, the closest integer to the first inflection point – representing the first local maximum – was chosen as the optimal combination of the burp parameters with "exclude spa types that are shorter than  <dig> repeats" and "spa types are clustered if costs are less or equal than 4". in this way a concordance of  <dig> % could be achieved . using these parameters, burp clustered the  <dig> spa types into  <dig> spa-ccs and  <dig> singletons. only  <dig>  spa types were excluded by using these parameters. in contrast, analysis of ungrouped spa types vs. eburst ccs resulted in  <dig> % concordance, only. a population snapshot of the  <dig> included strains after burp grouping is displayed in figure  <dig>  it shows clusters of linked spa types in spa-ccs, linked doublets, and individual unlinked spa types. in table  <dig>  exemplarily the spa-cc <dig>  its spa types, corresponding sts, and ccs is shown. in general, a high concordance between burp and eburst clustering can be observed. of the  <dig> spa types that were clustered in spa-cc <dig>  only three spa types were grouped into another cc and another three were judged as singletons by mlst.

spa types, their corresponding mlst sequence types , and clonal complexes  of spa-cc <dig> are shown. ano clonal complex was assigned for these singletons by eburst analysis, bthis st is preliminary named st <dig> and has the allelic profile  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

comparing whole-genome micro-array groupings  and spa-ccs of the  <dig> strains from the study of koreen et al. using the calibrated burp gave a concordance of  <dig> % – that is in the same range as reported. burp spa-ccs vs. manually grouped spa types resulted in  <dig> % concordance.

the underlying alignment model of burp takes repeat-duplication and -excision into account  <cit>  – in contrast to widely-used multiple alignment strategies like clustalw  <cit> . the proposed molecular mechanism of the evolution of such repeat regions is slipped-strand mispairing  during dna duplication  <cit> . the presence of those evolutionary events within the spa repeat region was already detected in vivo, when sequential s. aureus isolates from long-term pulmonary s. aureus colonization/infection of cystic fibrosis patients were spa typed  <cit> .

the high concordance of burp spa-ccs in comparison to eburst ccs using a diverse strain collection demonstrated that spa indeed contains long-term evolutionary signals. recent comparisons between spa-ccs and pfge clustering corroborated these findings  <cit> . in future, the integration of burp into the already established early-warning system for mrsa-outbreaks based on spa typing will help to detect clonal diversification during extended outbreaks  <cit> .

there are some limitations using spa-ccs for long-term analysis. first, the strains must be spa-typeable. having typed more than  <dig>  isolates, however, very few isolates  were not typeable – probably due to mutations within the primer binding regions. second, burp analyses are limited to spa types that pass the parameter of a certain number of repeats. however, when analyzing the spaserver content  comprising  <dig>  isolates with  <dig> different spa types, only  <dig>  of all spa types and  <dig>  of all submitted isolates are effected, respectively. finally, in very few instances, discrepancies can occur between spa and other typing methods as observed in this study and in two recent other publications  <cit> . these discrepancies are most probably due to recombinational events. large chromosomal replacements that give rise to such typing incongruences have been experimentally documented for two sts previously  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, burp is the first automated and objective tool to infer clonal relatedness from spa repeat regions. it is able to extract an evolutionary signal rather congruent to mlst and micro-array data.
