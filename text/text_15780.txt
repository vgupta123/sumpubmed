BACKGROUND
because of the watson-crick structure of dna – a paired with t and c with g – it is necessary that the number of as must equal the number of ts when the bases on both strands are counted. although, this equality does not have to be true for a single strand, chargaff's second law refers to the equality of a/t and c/g bases on a single strand  <cit>  and broadly speaking eukaryote genomes are free of intrastrand bias  <cit> . within this broad picture, a number of exceptions have been discovered at transcription start sites in plants and fungi  <cit> , animals  <cit> , and splice sites  <cit> . strand bias has been found for long regions of dna around actual and putative origins of replication  <cit> . analysis of nearby divergent genes has shown that both replication and transcription effects are important for strand bias in a range of eukaryotes  <cit> . strand bias for transcribed regions has been ascribed to transcription coupled repair  <cit> , but some categories of snps do not follow the pattern  <cit> . there is a weak  correlation between expression of human genes and strand bias  <cit> . in human genes, the strand bias has been shown to be confined to non-coding regions and accentuated at boundary regions  <cit> . by reversing the argument, strand bias can be used to find transcribed regions  <cit> : this method predicts many more transcribed regions.

this paper returns to the question of strand bias in bulk genomic dna, that is dna chosen at random from the entire genome. when the base composition of stretches of a dna strand are examined, it is found that for very long subsequences there is a strong negative correlation between  and  but for small subsequences this correlation has a small positive value.  is the number of guanine bases minus the number cytosine bases, and  is the difference between the number of adenine and thymine bases. this contrasts with animal chromosomes as a whole which have almost no strand bias. a species comparison shows that there is a strong effect for mammals and birds.

RESULTS
results for human at various sized windows
a sample of  <dig> fixed-length subsequences  were selected at random from the human genome and the correlation of the number of  bases with the number of  bases calculated. results for window sizes ranging from  <dig> bases to  <dig> mb are shown in the first column of table  <dig>  for small windows – under  <dig> kb – there is a small positive correlation of  with  so that the strand with more gs than cs has on average slightly more as than ts. however, for large windows an entirely different result obtains. for windows of  <dig> kb upwards there is a negative correlation between  and  and for large windows this correlation is strongly negative and the strand with more gs than as is overwhelmingly more likely to have fewer as than ts.

in each case the sample size is  <dig>  there is a smooth transition from very small to very large windows. the results for the masked genome are more pronounced than for the unmasked genome.

in case this result was an artefact of repeat elements in the genome, the analysis has been repeated on the sequence in which repeat elements were masked out by ns by repeatmasker  <cit> . the results are more pronounced and are shown in column two of table  <dig>  these results are illustrated in figures 1a and 1b which plot  against  for windows of size  <dig> bases and  <dig> kb respectively.

the correlation by window size given in table  <dig> is also plotted in figure 2: this figure shows the 95% confidence limits for these correlations. table  <dig> gives confidence intervals at selected values for the sample sizes used in this paper.

the limits are 95% confidence intervals which have been calculated from the fisher transformation as plus or minus two times the standard error.

the correlation coefficient is a measure of the scatter of the observations about a best fit straight line. a related but different question is the slope of this line: a note on this is given in additional file  <dig> 

one explanation for these results might be that in some regions of the genome there is a negative correlation and in others a positive correlation. in fact, this idea is not consistent with the analysis which is based on a random sampling of all the genome. however, to directly answer this point, a random sample of  <dig> windows of size  <dig> kb was taken from the masked human genome and from each window a  <dig> base subwindow was selected, with the position chosen uniformly from the large window. within the large and small windows the  versus  correlations are - <dig>  and + <dig>  respectively in line with the results in table  <dig>  the analysis was repeated on a subset of  <dig> large windows in which the bias was comparatively large, defined by |g - c| > median {|g - c|} and |a - t| > median {|a - t|}. for this subsample of large windows the correlation is - <dig> , and in the corresponding small windows the correlation is + <dig> . the point of this analysis is that the correlation from the subsample of small windows is similar to that in the full sample of small windows thus proving that opposite correlations in the large and small windows can coexist within the same region of the genome.

the transition between the positive correlation and the negative correlation is very smooth and takes place over a wide range of window sizes. the essence of the explanation of how this situation can exist is that given a large window where the same strand has a surplus of ts and gs, there is a slight tendency for ts and cs to separate from the gs and as. however, the statistics do not show a succession of small windows with clusters of these kinds in opposite orientation. the following analysis illustrates the situation with an example using a window size near the point where the correlation crosses over from negative to positive, although any window size could be used to illustrate the point. a sample of  <dig> windows of length  <dig> bases was taken and each window was divided into two: the upstream half and the down stream half, and various correlations were measured. let the suffix w refer to the sample of windows of length  <dig> bases; let the suffix  <dig> refer to the sample of windows obtained from the upstream half and let the suffix  <dig> refer to the sample of windows from the downstream half. the following correlations were found in the unmasked human genome:

a) correlation of w with w =  <dig> 

b) correlation of  <dig> with  <dig> =  <dig> 

c) correlation of  <dig> with  <dig> =  <dig> 

d) correlation of w with  <dig> =  <dig> 

e) correlation of w with  <dig> =  <dig> 

f) correlation of  <dig> with  <dig> =  <dig> 

g) correlation of  <dig> with  <dig> =  <dig> 

the trend shown in table  <dig> implies that the correlation of  with  in the combined window  is different from the correlations in the subwindows , and this can be shown directly by a statistical test: correlation  is statistically different from correlation  using a z test after a fisher transformation n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig>  z =  <dig> , two tailed test. the difference between  and  exists notwithstanding the high correlations at . although all the correlations  are positive, some values  are small enough to give room for some cancellation with increasing window size, leading to the correlation of  against  decreasing as the window size increases.

cross species analysis
these analyses have been repeated for those species for which sequencing has progressed to the point of giving a sequence for individual chromosomes: results for unmasked and masked genomes for two sizes of windows,  <dig> bases and  <dig> kb, are given in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the confidence intervals for these correlations can be estimated from table  <dig>  in each case, the sample size is  <dig> 

in each case the sample size is  <dig>  the figures in the difference column have a statistically significant difference from zero, ; for example z =  <dig> for human; n <dig> = n <dig> = 4000). the results are more pronounced for the higher organisms, with the result for chicken for  <dig> kb windows being close to  <dig> . note  for dog there is a small subpopulation which are outliers from the main part of the sample: when these observations are removed the correlation is - <dig> . the corresponding analysis on the previous assembly gave - <dig> .

in each case the sample size is  <dig>  the figures in the difference column have a statistically significant difference from zero, ; for example z =  <dig> for human; n <dig> = n <dig> = 4000). the difference column is more consistent than in table  <dig> 

the results for mammals consistently show the pattern set out above for human. the masked sequence shows a larger correlation than for wild type dna. for the representative marsupial, the opossum, the pattern changes slightly but the difference between the correlations in the two sized windows in the masked genome of the opossum is similar to other mammals. what happens for small windows varies from species to species but between the results for small and large windows there is an additive effect which is the same for each species. the correlations for chicken are - <dig>   and - <dig>   for the  <dig> kb window and the fact that there is almost no correlation for the smaller windows is consistent with there being a common difference between the two windows.

the results for fish and insects are weaker and less consistent than for mammals and the details are sensitive to whether or not the correlations are based on masked dna. although a larger sample of species would be valuable, these results show that there is some effect at work but it is not as strong or as consistent as for mammals and birds. for both vertebrates and invertebrates, there is a positive difference between the correlation at  <dig> kb and  <dig> bases. all of the differences are statistically highly significant: the least significant difference was found for the puffer fish in unmasked dna where the z score is  <dig> . c. intestinalis is representative of early chordates  <cit> , and there is a small difference between the correlations of the two sized windows which implies that this effect arose during this era  and has become larger over evolutionary time.

the clear exception to the categories described above is the more primitive c. elegans: in this case the correlation for  <dig> kb windows is positive and is greater than the correlation for the  <dig> base windows.

influence of gc%
to analyse whether the correlations are affected by the local gc%, each sample of subsequences was partitioned into three equal subsamples according to whether the gc% proportion of the subsequence was low, medium, or high. the correlation coefficients by this division by gc% for small  and large  window sizes for the masked genome are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

the sample size is  <dig> for the subsamples determined by gc%. confidence intervals may be estimated from table  <dig>  z values are based on the difference in the correlation coefficients after fisher transformation, n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig> 

the sample size is  <dig> for the subsamples determined by gc%. confidence intervals may be estimated from table  <dig>  z values are based on the difference in the correlation coefficients after fisher transformation, n <dig> = n <dig> =  <dig> 

the z values for the difference between correlations of different gc subsamples for  <dig> base windows are shown in table  <dig>  a number of values reach the traditional significance of p =  <dig>  at z =  <dig> , and for primates, e.g. human, chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, the correlation for the low gc sample is less than the mid gc sample and the low gc sample less than the high gc sample. however, the statistical results are not consistent across the species and the size of any effect is small. for the larger window size , shown in table  <dig>  the statistical significance is higher and more consistent: however, for this size of window, the absolute size of the effect is very small.

the main point is that the contrast between large and small windows for the correlation coefficient does not depend on the gc%. however, there is a complex interplay between many factors that might lead to small effects: for example the effect of neighboring bases on point mutation rates , transcription, gc% and gene placement, dna replication: these results are therefore presented as negative controls.

strand bias segments
the high correlations seen in large windows for mammals and birds can only occur if the same strand has an excess of gs and ts for most of the sampled window. in other words, there must be long-range correlations in base composition, and correlations up to several thousand bases have already been observed  <cit> . the simplest situation would be where the same strand had more ts than as for the entire chromosome, but this does not occur – the cumulative bias for an entire chromosome is small. this implies that between different regions of the genome there are break points which the long-range influence does not cross. these boundaries might either be sharp or soft: however, between these boundaries the dna would have a given bias on the same strand: in other words, the genomes of these animals have a segmentation structure. as discussed below, a possible explanation for the long-range correlation is dna replication which is asymmetric between the lagging and leading strands: the 5'-a+/t+-3' boundaries would correspond to origins of replication  <cit> .

isochores
in the light of this conclusion, it may be asked if there is any connection with isochores. isochores are regions of the genome where the gc% is roughly constant within the region: it has been noted that a frequency distribution of gc% in a sample of windows has a number of peaks corresponding to the gc% of the small number of types of isochores. references  <cit>  discuss isochores, including the debate about the statistical reliability of isochores: these references also give maps of isochores. the isochore map of the human genome  <cit>  has been used to analyse if strand bias depends on isochores. the boundaries of isochores in this map are given to the nearest  <dig> kb and therefore only results for  <dig> kb windows have been reported.

the main isochore analysis is how the correlation coefficient of  with  varies with the type of isochore: as isochore types are defined by their gc% this is also an analysis by gc% of isochore. a sample of windows of  <dig> kb was taken from the middle of isochores of at least this length, and allocated to one of five types of isochore using these gc% limits to distinguish the types:  <dig> %  <dig> %  <dig> %  <dig> % chosen as the midpoints of the modal values reported in  <cit> . the results for each subsample have been plotted in figure  <dig> together with confidence limits and show no relationship with the type of isochore.

a number of other possible relationships have also been explored. good quality isochores – that is isochores with a low variation of the gc% within the isochore-might be different from poor quality isochores. if isochores were strand bias segments then consecutive isochores should have opposite biases and so the strand bias from windows from consecutive isochores would be negatively correlated. windows which overlapped isochore boundaries might show different results from those taken from the middle of isochores. the strand bias might depend on how close the gc% of the sample window was to the whole isochore. it is possible that the results depend on whether the isochore was a good example of its type . none of these analyses suggested that there was any direct relationship between strand bias and isochores beyond that seen for the gc%. one result has been given below to summarise this group of analyses.

if isochores corresponded to strand bias segments then the strand bias on either side of the boundary would be of opposite sign. restricting the analysis to boundaries between isochores of at least  <dig> kb, and taking a pair of windows each of size  <dig> kb either side of this boundary, the correlation between  in the two windows was + <dig> . with n =  <dig>  the correlation coefficient is statistically significant from zero , but has the wrong sign to support the hypothesis. the positive correlation between isochores suggests the opposite conclusion that isochores do not affect the strand bias. the corresponding correlation for  was also + <dig> .

effect of transcription
it has been argued  <cit>  that strand bias is correlated with transcription: therefore an analysis was performed on the genome after it was divided into transcribed and non-transcribed regions. for each window size, one sample was taken where each window lies entirely within a transcribed region and a second sample taken where each window lies entirely within a non-transcribed region. all samples were of size  <dig>  an analysis of the  versus  correlation has been made for both the unmasked and masked genomes. the results for the human genome are shown in figures 4a and 4b. as a cross-check, the corresponding figures for mouse are given in additional file  <dig> 

for very large windows there are some regions which are too small for the windows to fit into. the proportion of the transcribed and untranscribed regions which can be sampled for a given window size is given in table  <dig>  it can be seen that this is only a consideration for the very largest windows and the window sizes plotted in figures 4a and 4b all refer to a substantial fraction of the type of region. similarly for large windows it is likely that different windows in the same sample will overlap. this does not affect the fairness of the estimate correlation coefficient: it does affect the estimate of the confidence intervals, but no adjustment has been made for this and it is clear that the broad conclusions are statistically sound.

based on sequence assembly ncbi <dig> = hg <dig> and ensembl  <dig> = ensembl september  <dig>  and coding genes.

although figures 4a and 4b  show a difference between the transcribed and untranscribed regions, there is a noticeable similarity between the two kinds of region: the contrasting correlations observed in small and large windows is a feature of both transcribed and untranscribed regions. for small window sizes the correlations in both kinds of regions take a small positive value. for intermediate window sizes around  <dig> bases upwards, there is a difference between the transcribed and untranscribed regions, with the untranscribed regions still showing a positive correlation, and the transcribed regions showing a negative correlation. for very large windows the correlations of both kinds of region are highly negative and are of similar size. at nearly all window sizes the untranscribed region shows the more positive correlation.

introns have also been compared with exons. individual exons  have been kept separate and have not been fused together. exons are comparatively short and, as table  <dig> shows, it is not possible to make an intron/exon comparison for long windows. correlations of the  versus  have therefore been calculated only for window sizes up to  <dig> bases: they are shown in figures 5a and 5b. the results for introns and exons are similar but correlations for introns are slightly more positive.

the analysis above uses the ensembl definition that exons include the untranslated regions of the mrna. a special case is the purely protein coding sequence within an individual exon: only a quarter of this type of sequence is accessible to windows  <dig> bases long. an analysis of windows up to this size showed no statistically significant difference from the corresponding results for exons: for example the correlation for window size  <dig> bases was  <dig>  for the unmasked genome, and  <dig>  for the masked genome . this analysis shows that the generally positive correlation seen for short windows is not the result of  observations coming from coding sequences. on the contrary, in this respect, coding sequences are similar to the other types of sequence.

causes
the literature has pointed to two possible causes of the bias observed in this paper, transcription and replication. in the context of eukaryotes, transcription is the more discussed and replication less so. dna replication would give the kind of strand bias found in the large scale analyses for reasons discussed previously  <cit> . the decisive consideration is that the strand bias occurs throughout the genome, which argues in favour of a genome wide process such as dna replication as being the direct cause.

the strand bias observed for transcribed and untranscribed regions are similar at both ends of the graph , suggesting that transcription is not the underlying cause. for intermediate sized windows, there is a marked difference between the transcribed and untranscribed regions, and this result is open to the interpretation that a transcription coupled process is an important modifier of the results at these scales. the results point towards a complicated relationship between chromatin organisation, dna replication, transcription and strand bias  <cit> .

the bias in small windows has received less attention in the literature. again there is a small difference between transcribed and untranscribed regions but transcription  is not the main point. it is proposed that dna evolution has some very local process which depends on the immediate neighbouring bases, either for the insertion of individual bases or the mutation of individual bases – this would have the effect of magnifying local random strand biases. in a larger scale region consisting of one dna replication unit  there would be an additional process which would consistently give a bias in the same direction and dominate the local effect. mutation rates of single nucleotides depend on their immediate neighbours  <cit> . many mutations, e.g. cg to tg or ca, do not affect the correlation between  and  when both strands are considered. it is a subtle point as to which mutations do affect this correlation, and this can only be proved by a detailed simulation. however, the following argument suggests that this effect would lead to a local positive correlation. as noted above a local positive correlation can coexist with a long-range negative correlation if the ts and cs are  clustered together and the as and gs  clustered together. using the notation r = a or g, y = t or c, the only mutations which make a difference to the number of clusters  of rs or ys are those of the form yry ↔ yyy . there are sixteen of these pairs e.g. tgc ↔ ttc. figure  <dig>  of  <cit>  has been used to estimate the rates:  <dig> of these mutations tend to the right hand side, two to the left hand side, two are in near equilibrium. in aggregate there is therefore a slight tendency for local clustering of the ts with the cs.

there is a broad relationship, at least in vertebrates, between body temperature  and the correlations shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  body temperature is not a precisely defined variable, as it varies with position in the body, daily and yearly cycles, age of the individual, and from individual to individual. for cold blooded animals the temperature will depend on the habitat. however it is noticeable that the most negative correlation is from chicken  – figures in brackets are for  <dig> kb windows  – which has a body temperature of around 40–42°c. the next most negative group of correlations is from mammals which have a body temperature around 37°c, e.g. mouse . the opossum has a lower correlation , but its body temperature is also lower - <dig> °c  <cit> . this trend is continued with the results of the three fish ,  and , and also with the results from the two insects  and . it is plausible that body temperature is a causative variable as one would expect this to affect dna mutation rates and there is a formula for mutations per site per unit time in terms of temperature and body mass  <cit> . the evidence suggests that the small window effect is little affected by body temperature and the large window effect is substantially affected by body temperature. the correlations from the small and large scale windows must have different causes and it is therefore plausible that the different causes are affected unequally by body temperature.

CONCLUSIONS
there is a contrasting strand bias in base compostion for large and small subsequences of dna sequences, with warm blooded animals showing a negative correlation for  versus  in large windows.

these correlations are independent of isochores in the human genome, and cannot be explained in terms of transcription. the strand bias can be explained by dna replication. the results imply that the genome of mammals and birds is composed of segments of alternating strand bias. the full story is likely to be a complex interaction between chromatin architecture, dna replication, transcription and strand bias, in line with recent interpretations  <cit>  that one type of strand bias boundaries are origins of replication with both frequency of gene placement and abundance of expression related to position with respect to these boundaries.
