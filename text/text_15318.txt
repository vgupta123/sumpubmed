BACKGROUND
the adenovirus e1a c-terminal binding protein  was identified as a cellular protein that specifically binds with the pldls-motif in e1a and regulates the transforming activity of e1a  <cit> . subsequent studies have shown that ctbp is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-repressor that is utilized by a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate transcriptional repressors  <cit> . ctbp1/ <dig> regulate expression of genes that control cell differentiation  <cit> , proliferation  <cit>  and apoptosis  <cit> , with critical consequences on oncogenesis  <cit> .

the ctbp <dig> locus codes for three splice variants - ctbp2-l , ctbp2-s and ribeye. ctbp2-l is localized in the nucleus while ctbp2-s and ribeye that lack a unique n-terminal region  present in ctbp2-l are cytosolic  <cit> . the ctbp <dig> ntr is acetylated by p <dig>  <cit>  and this modification is linked to the subcellular localization of ctbp <dig>  ctbp <dig> which lacks such a domain is believed to localize in the nucleus by alternate mechanisms including heterodimerization with ctbp2-l and interaction with nuclear transcription factors  <cit> . structural studies have revealed that ctbp <dig> is a dimer and the structure is substantially similar to that of 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases  <cit> . ctbp <dig> also has a similar structure . the n-terminal region and c-terminal region of ctbp form a hydrophobic cleft to interact with cofactors that contain motifs similar to the canonical ctbp-binding motif, pldls present in adenovirus e1a. in addition to the core pldls motif, adjoining sequences may also influence the affinity of interaction  <cit> .

in vitro studies have shown that dimerization of ctbp <dig> is required for interaction with e1a  <cit> . nad-mediated dimerization has been reported to enhance the transcriptional repression activity of ctbp  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether the ctbp monomer can interact with pldls-containing factors in vivo and mediate transcriptional repression. although ctbp <dig> mutants deficient in dimerization are defective in transcriptional repression, it is difficult to ascribe this lack of activity to co-factor recruitment since such mutants of ctbp <dig> are deficient in nuclear localization  <cit> .

transcriptional repression by ctbp proteins appears to be dependent on simultaneous interaction of ctbp with both a dna-binding repressor and a chromatin modifying enzymes, such as hdac  <cit> . importantly, the cleft region of ctbp <dig> appears to be involved in interaction of both pldls-motif factors and non-pldls factors  <cit> . while the pldls-dependent interaction between ctbp and repressors has been well-characterized, the interaction between ctbp and hdac remains unclear. since ctbps are dimers, the presence of two different cleft regions in the dimer would complicate the analysis of interaction of these factors with the cleft region. here, we have used a monomeric mutant of ctbp <dig> that is capable of nuclear localization under the control of the cognate nuclear localization signal  <cit> . we have discovered that the ctbp <dig> monomer can interact with a major ctbp-dependent repressor zeb as well as hdac and that the interaction of the two factors with the ctbp <dig> monomer was mutually exclusive. these results have led us to formulate a model by which the ctbp dimer could assemble repression complexes by simultaneous interaction with a pldls-motif factor and a non-pldls factor.

methods
cell culture, transfection, immunofluorescent staining, and luciferase assays
hela,  <dig>  mcf <dig> and ctbp1/ <dig> double knock-out mef <dig> cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. transfection reagent jetpei was used for transient transfection for luciferase assay, and lipofectamine  <dig> was used for transfection for co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses as previously described  <cit> . for luciferase assays, cells were transfected in 24-well plates in duplicates. average luciferase activity was plotted, with the control luciferase activity normalized to  <dig> . average deviation was plotted as the error bar. for co-immunoprecipitation analysis, cells were transfected in  <dig> mm dishes, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the flag antibody beads . when the hbh tag  was used, transfected cells were treated with  <dig> μm biotin for the duration of transfection, and immunoprecipitation was performed with the streptavidin-agarose beads . immunofluorescence analysis was performed with the cy3-conjugated flag antibody .

dss cross-linking
cells in 12-well plates were incubated with  <dig> mm dissuccinimidyl suberate   in the culture medium for  <dig> min. after washing with pbs, cells were lysed with  <dig> μl of 2× sds sample loading buffer and examined by western blots as described in the text.

plasmid constructs
the zeb  region coding for aa #680- <dig> containing the pldls-like motifs was pcr-amplified with primer n <dig>  and n <dig> , digested with bamhi/ecori, and cloned into the vector pgfp-e1a  <cit>  to generate pgfp-zeb <dig>  mutants of zeb <dig> were cloned similarly by using an overlapping pcr approach  <cit> . for expression of gst-zeb <dig>  zeb <dig> region was transferred from pgfp-zeb <dig> to a pgst vector at the xhoi/ecori sites. mutants of zeb <dig> were transferred to the gst vector by the same approach. rr-ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> mutants were generated based on the pfh-ctbp <dig> construct  <cit>  using the quick-change kit . the primers for rr-ctbp <dig>  were # <dig>  and # <dig> . the primer for gg-ctbp <dig>  was # <dig> . other ctbp constructs were described earlier  <cit> .

gst pull-out assay
gst fusion constructs were induced with  <dig> mm iptg for  <dig> h for expression of gst fusion proteins. lysates containing the desired gst fusion proteins were loaded onto glutathione-agarose beads in the binding buffer containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl ,  <dig>  m nacl,  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig>  mm dtt,  <dig>  mm pmsf, and the protease inhibitor cocktail . subsequently, purified h6-ctbp <dig> and h6-rr-ctbp <dig>  were incubated with the pre-charged glutathione-agarose beads in  <dig> μl of the binding buffer for  <dig> h at 4°c. after washing, bound ctbp <dig> proteins were examined by western blot with the ctbp <dig> monoclonal antibody and the gst fusion proteins examined by coomassie blue staining.

RESULTS
analysis of ctbp <dig> dimerization
first, we examined the role of various structural elements of ctbp <dig> in dimerization using the cross-linking approach. to validate this approach, we carried out western-blot analysis of hela cells exposed to the cross-linking agent dss . higher molecular weight bands that corresponded to dimers of ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> were readily detected while no such dimers were detected in untreated cells. we noticed a doublet in the position of the endogenous ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> dimers. although the exact reasons for the formation of such doublets are unknown, it may be possible that they are due to heterodimerization of ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig>  and/or cross-linking of ctbp to other cellular proteins. in addition, the high molecular weight band in lane  <dig> of fig. 1a in the absence of dss could be a non-specific band or an alternative high order form of ctbp <dig> that is resistant to denaturing sds-page conditions.

to examine the roles of the various ctbp <dig> domains in ctbp <dig> dimerization, flag-ha-tagged ctbp <dig> and mutants were transfected into hela cells. after dss cross-linking, cell lysates were examined by western blot analysis using the flag antibody. as shown , deletion of the unique ctbp <dig> n-terminal region  did not affect the extent of dimerization, but severely reduced the ability of ctbp <dig> to form higher order forms . mutations r147l/r169l  corresponding to the critical residues in the predicted dimerization interface of ctbp <dig>  <cit>  severely reduced dimer formation as well as other higher order forms of ctbp <dig> . despite the reported effects of nad-binding on ctbp <dig> dimerization, a mutation in the nad-binding motif of ctbp <dig>  did not affect ctbp <dig> dimerization by this analysis . similarly, a mutation within the pldls-binding cleft  that severely reduces interaction with various pldls-motif factors also did not affect dimerization.

to determine whether the rr-ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> mutants were capable of forming dimers under normal  conditions, hela cells were co-transfected with flag-ha tagged ctbp <dig> or various mutants, and their corresponding versions with a c-terminal hbh tag. the hbh tag contains a biotinylation signal sequence sandwiched between two  <dig> tags  <cit> . cell lysates were adsorbed with the streptavidin-agarose affinity beads, and the precipitated proteins examined by western blots as indicated. as shown in fig. 1c, wt ctbp2-hbh dimerized efficiently with the wt fh-ctbp <dig> , whereas the streptavidin-agarose beads did not pull out fh-ctbp <dig> alone . the rr-ctbp2-hbh mutant did not dimerize with fh-rr-ctbp <dig> . interestingly, by this approach gg-ctbp2-hbh was found to form a dimer with fh-gg-ctbp <dig> , but at a greatly reduced level compared to the wt ctbp <dig> . thus, the rr-ctbp <dig> mutant may have a reduced level of dimerization which is only detectible under cross-linking conditions. in contrast, the nad-binding mutant gg-ctbp <dig> remains capable of forming a dimer, which appears to be less stable under co-immunoprecipitation conditions and could be stabilized by cross-linking with dss .

co-factor recruitment by monomeric ctbp2
to examine the effects of ctbp <dig> dimerization and nad-binding on interaction with cellular and viral co-factors, flag-ha-tagged ctbp <dig> and the rr-ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> mutants were transfected into  <dig> cells, which express endogenous e1a, and ctbp <dig> complexes were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with the flag antibody. western blot analysis of the ctbp <dig> complexes showed that the dimerization mutant, rr-ctbp <dig> , and the mutant in the nad-binding motif, gg-ctbp <dig> , bound to zeb and hdac <dig> well. however, binding of mutant rr-ctbp <dig> to other factors was defective. in contrast, gg-ctbp <dig>  bound to other co-factors much less efficiently than the wt ctbp <dig> but much more efficiently than rr-ctbp <dig> . these results suggest that dimerization and nad-binding are both critical for ctbp <dig> interaction with co-factors. the reduced efficiency of gg-ctbp <dig> binding to most co-factors appears to be correlated with the reduced stability of the gg-ctbp <dig> dimer .

to compare co-factor binding by ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig>  fh-ctbp <dig> was also included in the analysis . as shown, ctbp <dig> bound to p <dig> and e1a more efficiently than ctbp <dig>  whereas ctbp <dig> bound to hdac <dig> more efficiently than ctbp <dig>  interestingly, deletion of the ctbp <dig> n-terminal domain  rendered ctbp <dig> to behave similarly to ctbp <dig>  thus, the unique n-terminal region  of ctbp <dig> appears to regulate ctbp <dig> interaction with co-factors.

previous results have shown that the unique ctbp <dig> ntr allows ctbp <dig> to be localized completely in the nucleus while ctbp <dig> lacking the ntr is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus  <cit> . to examine the role of dimerization for ctbp <dig> nuclear localization, flag-ha-tagged ctbp <dig>  rr-ctbp <dig>  and gg-ctbp <dig> were transfected into hela cells, and their subcellular localization detected with the flag antibody. as shown in fig. 2b, while the wt ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> were predominantly localized in the nucleus, rr-ctbp <dig> had significant cytoplasmic localization. previous analysis of a ctbp <dig> dimerization mutant suggested that it was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm  <cit> . thus, it appears that while the dimerization mutations reduced the efficiency of ctbp <dig> nuclear localization, the ctbp <dig> ntr remains functional in targeting the rr-ctbp <dig> mutant to the nucleus.

dimerization and nad-binding in ctbp <dig> repression of e-cadherin  promoter
transcriptional repression by ctbp <dig> and ctbp <dig> requires ctbp interaction with both dna-targeting transcription repressors, such as zeb  <cit> , and enzymes involved in chromatin modification/remodeling, such as hdac1/ <dig>  <cit> . since both rr-ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> interacted with zeb well , we examined the ability of these ctbp <dig> mutants to repress the e-cad promoter. although several different repressors have been implicated in repression of the e-cad promoter, zeb appears to play a dominant role  <cit> . ctbp <dig> wt or its mutants were co-transfected with the e-cad-luc reporter into the ctbp1/ <dig> double knock-out cell line, mef <dig>  luciferase assay showed that gg-ctbp <dig> retained significant repression activity, while rr-ctbp <dig> had no repression activity . thus, the ability of rr-ctbp <dig> to interact with zeb  appears to be insufficient for repression of the e-cad promoter.

binding of hdac and zeb to the ctbp <dig> monomer is mutually exclusive
we previously reported that ctbp <dig> repression of e-cad promoter was dependent on hdacs  <cit> . our results in fig. 2a indicated efficient interaction of hdac <dig> and zeb with rr-ctbp <dig> in co-immunoprecipitation studies. since rr-ctbp <dig> interacts with zeb but does not repress the e-cad promoter , it is possible that rr-ctbp <dig> interaction with zeb and with hdac is mutually exclusive. to examine this possibility, the zeb region , which contains three candidate pldls-like motifs, was cloned as a fusion construct, gfp-zeb <dig>  flag-ha-tagged ctbp <dig> or rr-ctbp <dig> was transfected into hela cells alone or together with gfp-zeb <dig>  lysates were immunoprecipitated with the flag antibody and the precipitated proteins analyzed by western blots . as shown, both ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> bound to gfp-zeb <dig> as expected . control co-transfection of rr-ctbp <dig> with gfp-cter, which expresses a gfp fusion protein containing the e1a c-terminal region encompassing the pldls motif  <cit>  showed that rr-ctbp <dig> bound to gfp-cter much less efficiently , consistent with the observation that rr-ctbp <dig> was defective in binding to cellular endogenous e1a in  <dig> cells . interaction of ctbp <dig> or rr-ctbp <dig> with gfp-zeb <dig> resulted in inhibition of interaction with the cellular endogenous zeb , but did not affect ctbp <dig> interaction with corest . rr-ctbp <dig> binding to hdac <dig> was severely competed by gfp-zeb <dig> , and was competed to a lesser extent by gfp-cter , consistent with the lower efficiency of rr-ctbp <dig> binding to gfp-cter. ctbp <dig> wt binding to hdac <dig> was competed to some extent by gfp-zeb <dig> . however, ctbp <dig> retained a higher level of hdac <dig> binding than rr-ctbp <dig> in the presence of gfp-zeb <dig> .

to substantiate the conclusion that zeb and hdac <dig> bound to rr-ctbp <dig> competitively, rr-ctbp <dig> was co-transfected with increasing amounts of gfp-zeb <dig> into hela cells and co-immunoprecipitation analysis was again performed . as shown, with increasing amounts of gfp-zeb <dig>  binding of endogenous zeb and hdac <dig> to rr-ctbp <dig> was progressively reduced. thus, the competition between zeb and hdac <dig> binding to rr-ctbp <dig> may be partly accountable for the defective transcriptional repression of the e-cad promoter by rr-ctbp <dig> .

interaction of zeb with the ctbp <dig> monomer requires multiple pldls-like motifs
the near normal interaction between rr-ctbp <dig> and zeb was in sharp contrast to the defective interaction between rr-ctbp <dig> and e1a . within the ctbp-interaction domain of zeb, there are three pldls-like motifs  - a central pldls motif, and a plnls motif on both sides. the middle motif is identical to the canonical ctbp-binding motif of e1a  <cit> . to directly examine the roles of the individual pldls-like motifs in interaction with wt ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig>  zeb <dig> region was expressed as a gst-zeb <dig> fusion protein. mutants of gst-zeb <dig> were constructed as shown in fig. 4a, to incorporate mutations in the pldls-like motifs. the dlm <dig> mutant contains dl→as mutations in the central pldls motif, the plm1/ <dig> mutant contains pl→as mutations in the two plnls motifs, and the plm1- <dig> mutant contains mutations in all three motifs.

gst-zeb <dig> and gst-e1a were first used for in vitro pull-out assays to examine their binding to h6-tagged wt ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig>  as shown in fig. 4b, while gst-zeb <dig> bound to both wt ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> efficiently , gst-e1a only bound to wt ctbp <dig> efficiently  but not to rr-ctbp <dig> . neither wt ctbp <dig> nor rr-ctbp <dig> interacted with the gfp-e1a-c* mutant , which carried a dl→as mutation within the pldls motif. these results are consistent with the observation in vivo that zeb bound to rr-ctbp <dig> at near normal levels, whereas e1a did not bind to rr-ctbp <dig> . thus, the ctbp <dig> monomer appears to preferentially interact with zeb both in vivo and in vitro.

gst-zeb <dig> mutants with mutations in various pldls-like motifs were also analyzed for their interaction with h6-ctbp <dig> and h6-rr-ctbp <dig> . for this analysis, comparable amounts of h6-ctbp <dig> and h6-rr-ctbp <dig> were used . in all lanes bound h6-ctbp <dig> and h6-rr-ctbp <dig> were examined on the same western blot, and were arranged as the top  and middle  panels for comparison. as shown, despite a small reduction in interaction between h6-ctbp <dig> and zeb101-dlm <dig> , h6-ctbp <dig>  interacted efficiently with the wt zeb <dig> , as well as the two mutants . in contrast, h6-rr-ctbp <dig>  bound to gst-zeb <dig> and mutants less efficiently than h6-ctbp <dig> . in particular, h6-rr-ctbp <dig> bound to gst-zeb <dig>  much better than the zeb101-dlm <dig> mutant . the zeb101-plm1/ <dig> mutant  bound to rr-ctbp <dig> only slightly less efficiently than the wt zeb <dig> . as expected, mutation of all three pldls-like motifs rendered zeb <dig> incapable of interaction with both the wt ctbp <dig>  and the rr-ctbp <dig> mutant . these results suggested that all three pldls-like motifs in zeb <dig> may contribute to the interaction with rr-ctbp <dig>  among the three motifs the central pldls motif appears to be most important.

nuclear targeting of gfp-zeb by ctbp <dig> monomeric mutant
we previously reported that ctbp <dig> promotes nuclear localization of a cytoplasmically localized e1a mutant  <cit> . gfp-zeb <dig> was localized throughout the cell in a diffused pattern , consistent with the fact that the zeb sequence does not contain a nuclear localization signal. coexpression of gfp-zeb <dig> and ctbp <dig> wt resulted in nuclear localization of gfp-zeb <dig> . interestingly, co-expression of gfp-zeb <dig> with rr-ctbp <dig> also resulted in nuclear localization of gfp-zeb <dig> , despite the reduced efficiency of nuclear localization for rr-ctbp <dig> compared to wt ctbp <dig> . it should be noted that rr-ctbp <dig> nuclear localization seems to be slightly enhanced by co-transfection with gfp-zeb <dig> . it might be possible that interaction of rr-ctbp <dig> with a pldls-containing partner helps stabilize the conformation of rr-ctbp <dig> to enhance the nuclear localization of rr-ctbp <dig>  in contrast, the subcellular localization of gfp-zeb-plm1- <dig> was only marginally changed by co-expression of wt ctbp <dig> , consistent with the observation that interaction of wt ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> with gst-zeb-plm1- <dig> was defective . although rr-ctbp <dig> interacted with gst-zeb-dlm <dig> in vitro much more weakly than wt ctbp <dig> , both wt ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> enhanced nuclear localization of gfp-zeb-dlm <dig>  suggesting that even a weaker interaction between rr-ctbp <dig> and gfp-zeb-dlm <dig> may be sufficient for enhanced nuclear localization of gfp-zeb-dlm <dig>  thus, both the ctbp <dig> dimer and ctbp <dig> monomer appear to be capable of promoting the nuclear localization of their interaction partners.

transcriptional repression by rr-ctbp <dig> when tethered to the promoter by gal <dig> fusion
to examine the functional correlation between ctbp <dig> interaction with gfp-zeb <dig> and ctbp <dig> transcriptional repression, zeb <dig> was expressed as a gal4-zeb <dig> fusion protein. co-transfection of gal4-zeb <dig> with the luciferase reporter, g5-mlp-luc, into mcf <dig> cells resulted in transcriptional repression . similarly, gal4-zeb-dlm <dig> was also active in repression, consistent with the ability of gst-zeb-dlm <dig> to interact with both the ctbp <dig> monomer and ctbp <dig> dimer . in contrast, gal4-zeb-plm1- <dig> did not repress transcription, possibly due to its defective interaction with ctbp.

when gal4-zeb <dig> was co-transfected with g5-mlp-luc into mef <dig> cells with ctbp1/ <dig> double knock-out, it did not repress transcription , consistent with the ctbp deficiency in mef <dig> cells. however, co-transfection of gal4-zeb <dig> with ctbp <dig> resulted in transcriptional repression. in contrast, co-transfection of gal4-zeb <dig> with rr-ctbp <dig> had a much lower transcriptional repression activity. these results are consistent with the observation that rr-ctbp <dig> binding to zeb and hdac <dig> is mutually exclusive . when gal4-zeb-plm1- <dig> was co-transfected with ctbp <dig>  a low level of transcriptional repression was observed. however, the level of activity was much less compared to that mediated by gal4-zeb <dig>  the transcriptional repression activity mediated by gal4-plm1- <dig> could be due to a low level of in vivo interaction between gal4-plm1- <dig> and ctbp <dig>  thus, the ability of gal4-zeb <dig> to repress transcription appears to be correlated with interaction of endogenous ctbp <dig> through the pldls-like motifs in gal4-zeb <dig> 

the ability of ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> to directly repress transcription was also examined by the gal4-tethering assay . as shown, both gal4-ctbp <dig> and gal4-rr-ctbp <dig> were active in repression of transcription. thus, once tethered to the promoter by gal <dig>  the ctbp <dig> monomer is capable of transcriptional repression. importantly, when the hdac inhibitor tsa was included during transfection, transcriptional repression by both gal4-ctbp <dig> and gal4-rr-ctbp <dig> was abolished. thus, gal4-tethered transcriptional repression by ctbp <dig> and rr-ctbp <dig> appeared to be mostly mediated by hdac.

discussion
the transcriptional repression function of ctbp corepressors appears to depend on simultaneous recruitment of dna-binding repressors and chromatin modifying enzymes by ctbp. ctbp interaction with dna binding repressors is usually mediated through pldls-like motifs in the repressors  <cit> . in some cases, it also involves an auxiliary motif known as the rrt motif present in repressors such as znf <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to our understanding of the mode of interaction of pldls-motif and pldls/rrt motif factors, the mode of interaction of chromatin modifying enzymatic constituents of the ctbp corepressor complex remains less well defined. a detailed mutagenesis study of ctbp <dig> has indicated that the pldls-binding cleft of ctbp <dig> plays a critical role in recruiting these factors  <cit> . certain amino acid substitution mutations within the cleft region of ctbp <dig>  <cit>  and ctbp <dig>  <cit>  affect interaction with both pldls-motif factors and hdac1/ <dig>  in an earlier study, we have attempted to investigate interaction of ctbp cofactors with a monomeric mutant of ctbp <dig>  <cit> . since ctbp <dig> monomeric mutants were excluded from the nucleus, we used a heterologous  nuclear localization signal to target such mutants to the nucleus. the interaction of most cofactors with such chimeric mutant was substantially increased suggesting that the observed interaction may not reflect the normal pattern of interaction possibly due to localization of the mutant in non-relevant nuclear sub-compartment. thus, our present analysis of cofactor interaction with the monomeric ctbp <dig> targeted to the nucleus via the cognate targeting mechanism appears to reflect the normal pattern of interaction.

we employed two different ctbp <dig> mutants, one with mutations in residues corresponding to residues of ctbp <dig> implicated in dimerization  and the other in the conserved nad-binding motif . since no direct structural data is available for these mutants, potential unintended effects of these mutations on ctbp <dig> structure may not be excluded. interestingly, both rr-ctbp <dig> and gg-ctbp <dig> bound to zeb and hdac <dig> to near normal levels . in contrast, gg-ctbp <dig> binding to other ctbp <dig> co-factors was greatly reduced, and rr-ctbp <dig> binding to these co-factors was mostly defective. these observations suggest that ctbp <dig> interaction with certain cofactors may be less dependent on dimerization or nad-binding, and raise the possibility that ctbp <dig> monomer may have unique functions. it should be noted that by dss cross-linking analysis, rr-ctbp <dig> still retained a small degree of dimerization . the possibility that the low level of dimerization is required for rr-ctbp <dig> to interact with zeb and hdac <dig> could not be excluded. examination of subcellular localization of ctbp <dig> and its mutants revealed that while gg-ctbp <dig> and wt ctbp <dig> assumed a predominant nuclear localization pattern, rr-ctbp <dig> had significant cytoplasmic localization. thus, although nad-binding does not appear to be critical for ctbp <dig> nuclear localization , it significantly affects ctbp <dig> interaction with co-factors other than zeb and hdac <dig>  the reduced efficiency of rr-ctbp <dig> nuclear localization may be partially accountable for the reduced interaction of rr-ctbp <dig> with zeb .

the observations with the mutant of ctbp <dig> in the nad-binding motif, gg-ctbp <dig>  revealed important clues to transcriptional repression by ctbp <dig>  the dimerization of the gg-ctbp <dig> mutant was normal as judged by dss cross-linking . however, by co-immunoprecipitation analysis the gg-ctbp <dig> mutant dimerized at a greatly reduced efficiency compared to the wt ctbp <dig> . these results seem to be consistent with the hypothesis that nad-binding induces conformational changes in ctbp to stabilize ctbp dimerization  <cit> . in ctbp1/ <dig> double knock-out mef <dig> cells, retrovirally-expressed gg-ctbp <dig> had similar activity as the wild type ctbp <dig> in e-cad promoter localization and e-cad transcriptional repression, whereas rr-ctbp <dig> expressed in this fashion was unstable and could not be analyzed . these results are consistent with the finding that gg-ctbp <dig> binding to zeb and hdac <dig> was nearly normal , and gg-ctbp <dig> remains capable of transcriptional repression in transient reporter assays . although e-cad transcriptional repression by ctbp <dig> does not appear to require nad-binding by ctbp <dig>  it is possible that under certain physiological conditions nad-binding by ctbp <dig> becomes important for the transcriptional repression activity of ctbp <dig>  importantly, since gg-ctbp <dig> binding to co-factors other than zeb and hdac <dig> was severely reduced, it is expected that ctbp <dig> regulation of other potential candidate target genes is more dependent on nad binding than repression of e-cad.

two important results have emanated from our present study with the monomeric ctbp <dig> - 1) ctbp <dig> co-factors have varying degrees of requirements for ctbp <dig> dimerization and nad-binding, and 2) the interaction of hdac and pldls-motif factors with ctbp <dig> monomer might be mutually exclusive. the interaction between ctbp <dig> monomer and zeb appears to be dependent on three pldls-like motifs. mutational analysis of these motifs in zeb suggest that the central pldls motif is most critical, while the two flanking plnls motifs appear to play auxiliary roles . it is important to note that the pldls motif in e1a is identical to the central pldls motif of zeb, and yet the gfp-e1a-cter fusion protein interacted with the ctbp <dig> monomer much more weakly than gfp-zeb <dig> , suggesting that auxiliary motifs may contribute to the unique binding activity of zeb. our results on zeb binding with ctbp <dig> monomer agrees well with a previous report on zeb binding with ctbp <dig> and repression assays, where all three sites were found to be required for efficient ctbp-binding and full repression activity  <cit> . thus, the unique arrangement of the three pldls-like motifs in zeb appears to contribute to the ability of zeb to interact with the ctbp <dig> monomer. it seems possible that the two plnls motifs in zeb may function as low affinity nucleation sites and the central pldls motif may function as the high affinity site for stable interaction with ctbp <dig> 

it is possible that presence of two or more binding motifs among the ctbp binding factors may be more prevalent than previously recognized. for example, the presence of a plnls motif and the rrt motif in znf <dig> facilitates interaction with the ctbp dimer  <cit> . the possibility that a similar mode of interaction may be used by riz, znf <dig>  <cit>  and wiz  <cit>  has been pointed out. our present study shows that the pldls and plnls motifs of zeb are functionally redundant for interaction with the ctbp <dig> dimer. two different divergent pldls-related motifs of ebv ebna3b have been reported to synergize for binding with ctbp  <cit> . more recently a second binding site has been identified in adenovirus e1a, in addition to the pldls motif  <cit> . presence of divergent and functionally redundant ctbp-binding motifs in transcription factors may regulate transcription by context-dependent recruitment of ctbp and chromatin modifying enzymes.

our current analysis of cofactor interaction with the ctbp <dig> monomer has revealed new insights into the mechanism of the hdac-dependent repression of the e-cad promoter by ctbp <dig>  zeb and hdac <dig> appeared to compete for interaction with the ctbp <dig> monomer since co-expression of the ctbp <dig> monomer with gfp-zeb <dig> severely hindered hdac <dig> interaction with rr-ctbp <dig> . hdac <dig> interaction with rr-ctbp <dig> was progressively reduced by increasing amounts of gfp-zeb <dig> . this may account for the lack of repression of the e-cad promoter by the ctbp <dig> monomer . a ctbp <dig> monomer anchored to the e-cad promoter through interaction with zeb may not be able to recruit repressive enzymes such as hdac <dig> to the promoter. however, anchoring of the ctbp <dig> monomer onto a promoter through gal <dig> fusion rendered the ctbp <dig> monomer capable of transcriptional repression , consistent with the conclusion that after gal <dig> anchoring of rr-ctbp <dig> to the promoter, the ctbp <dig> monomer remains capable of recruiting hdac. although gal <dig> functions as a dimer, it is expected that the gal4-rr-ctbp <dig> "quasi" dimer is structurally and functionally different from the natural ctbp <dig> dimer, and the ability of gal4-rr-ctbp <dig> to repress transcription resides in the ability of rr-ctbp <dig> to recruit hdac.

our results are consistent with the hypothesis that strong interaction of pldls-motif factors such zeb with the ctbp <dig> monomer may preclude interaction of the ctbp <dig> monomer with hdac . these results also lend support to the model of transcriptional repression by ctbp <dig> , in which ctbp <dig> normally interacts with a dna-bound repressor through one ctbp <dig> monomer, and recruits a dna modifying enzyme, such as hdac through the other ctbp <dig> monomer. in this context, it remains possible that interaction of one ctbp <dig> monomer with a repressor, such as zeb, may help facilitate recruitment of hdac through the other ctbp <dig> monomer.

CONCLUSIONS
1) ctbp <dig> monomer retains ability to interact with zeb but this interaction does not result in transcriptional repression.

2) ctbp <dig> monomer interaction with zeb involves three pldls-like motifs, each of which contributes to interaction to various extents.

3) a mutant in the nad-binding motif of ctbp <dig> seems to interact with zeb normally and repress e-cad transcription normally.

4) ctbp <dig> monomer interaction with zeb and hdac is mutually exclusive.
