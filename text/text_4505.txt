BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen responsible for respiratory tract infections, septicaemia and meningitis. several virulence factors contribute to colonization and early infection processes  <cit> . sialidases from pathogenic bacteria are considered as key virulence factors, as they remove sialic acid from host cell surface glycans, unmasking certain receptors to facilitate bacterial adherence and colonization. all s. pneumoniae clinical isolates investigated to date possess prominent sialidase activities. three sialidases, nana, nanb and nanc, are encoded by s. pneumoniae genomes. a study of sialidase genes in clinical pneumococcal isolates identified nana, nanb and nanc to be present in 100 %, 96 % and 51 % of these strains, respectively  <cit> . pneumococcal strains with knockouts of nana or nanb, and studied in mouse models, show that both proteins are essential to s. pneumoniae infection of the respiratory tract and sepsis  <cit> . nana, specifically, has been shown to play an important role in host-pneumococcal interactions in the upper respiratory tract  <cit> , and is involved in biofilm formation  <cit> . it has also been shown to desialylate competing bacteria such as neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae, potentially giving s. pneumoniae an advantage in shared bacterial niches  <cit> . furthermore, the nana from s. pneumoniae has also been shown to promote inflammation by disrupting sialic acid based recognition of cd <dig> by siglecg in mice   <cit> .

from amino acid sequence comparison of bacterial sialidases, nana is modular by nature and its domain organisation is similar to other known bacterial sialidases . the enzyme contains a catalytic domain flanked by an n-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain  that is downstream of a signal sequence, followed by a region of predicted disorder. at the c-terminus, there is a region rich in proline, glycine, threonine and serine containing a sequence of  <dig> amino acids repeated three times contiguously followed by an lpxtg anchor sequence. subsequent analysis of multiple pneumococcal strains showed that the nana gene is highly diverse, mainly in truncations in the c-terminal region, but that the n-terminal cbm and catalytic domain are conserved  <cit> . two studies have reported the importance of nana in allowing s. pneumoniae to adhere to and invade the blood–brain-barrier , through the use of human brain microvascular endothelial cells . in particular the n-terminal cbm domain  was found to be the critical determinant of this event  <cit> . both of these studies showed that the catalytic activity of nana only played a minor role in the adhesion/invasion event, with one study showing that the n-terminal cbm was also involved in the induction of neutrophil chemo-attractants il- <dig>  cxcl- <dig> and cxcl- <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic of the nana domains



we recently cloned the n-terminal cbm domain of nana  and carried out a glycan array screen that showed the domain binds to sialic acid  <cit> , and as such is a family  <dig> cbm as defined in the cazy database  <cit> . we have also engineered multivalent forms of this domain, designed to adhere with high affinity to sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract, and have shown that they prevent infection from influenza viruses in a mouse model. preliminary analysis of immunomodulators during this influenza study supports the ability of this domain to stimulate the immune system in mice, specifically il-1β, mip- <dig> , ifn-γ and tnf-α  <cit> .

to date, only the catalytic domain of nana has been studied structurally, and is the subject of small molecule inhibitor studies . here we describe the crystal structure of the s. pneumoniae nana cbm <dig> domain, hereafter named spcbm. crystal structures of spcbm, complexed with α <dig> -sialyllactose  and α <dig> -sialyllactose  are also described. the structure of spcbm is compared to other known cbm <dig> structures showing that it shares a similar fold. in contrast to the other cbm <dig> domains, spcbm has a deep water-filled pocket adjacent to the n-acetyl moiety of sialic acid and surrounded by a positively charged surface. in the crystal structures, the acidic pocket is partially occupied by a lysine residue from a symmetry-related molecule. the structure of spcbm suggests that it may recognise a second receptor that may be responsible for the induction of chemokines, and the bbb invasion event.

RESULTS
structure overview
all residues  of the expressed cbm were clearly identifiable in the spcbm crystal structure. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the native structure constitutes a central β-sandwich , a β-hairpin on one side of the sandwich, an α-helix present between the β-sheets and a c-terminal α-helix packing against the β-sandwich. when compared to other cbm <dig> structures, spcbm is structurally homologous to cbm <dig> modules from c. perfringens nanj ; rmsd  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα’s  <cit> , s. pneumoniae nanb ; rmsd  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα’s  <cit> , m. decora nanl ; rmsd  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα’s  <cit> , and v. cholerae nanh ; rmsd  <dig>  Å for  <dig> cα’s  <cit> . the superposition of spcbm with these structurally homologous domains is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> overall structure of the spcbm. cartoon representation of the spcbm in two orientations, coloured in rainbow colours from blue at the n-terminus to red at the c-terminus

ligand binding site
for the complexed structures, both 3’sl and 6’sl were co-crystallized with spcbm. there are no significant conformational changes between the apo spcbm structure and the complexed structure, and superimposition of the apo and holo structures gives an rmsd of  <dig>  Å over all cα atoms for both 3’sl and 6’sl. difference electron-density maps of both 3’sl and 6’sl molecules, in complex with spcbm, are clearly defined , particularly the sialic acid moiety of each sialoside. in the 3’sl and 6’sl complexes, the protein structures are highly similar, giving an rmsd of  <dig>  Å for all of the cα atoms while the sialic acid moieties of the ligands are completely superimposable. the lactose moieties of the 3’sl and 6’sl, however, point in opposite directions . in 3’sl, lactose does not interact with the protein, although o <dig> of the glucose moiety interacts with o <dig> of sialic acid. in 6’sl, glucose o <dig> interacts with the side chain of asp <dig>  for both ligands, the lactose b-factors are significantly higher than the corresponding sialic acid moiety.fig.  <dig> 3’sl and 6’sl co-complexed with spcbm. a stereo view of fo-fc map of 3’sl co-complex contoured at  <dig> σ level. b stereo view of fo-fc map of 6’sl co-complex contoured at  <dig> σ level. c stereo view of 3’sl  bound to the spcbm substrate-binding site



for spcbm, the residues that are involved in the interaction are mainly donated from the concave surface formed by the β-hairpin and three β-strands . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the carboxylate group of neu5ac forms a bidentate interaction with arg <dig>  a common feature in proteins that bind sialic acid. arg <dig> also interacts with one of the carboxylate oxygens of neu5ac. other neu5ac atoms make additional interactions with spcbm: o <dig> interacts with the side chain of glu <dig> as does the n <dig> of the acetamido group; the o <dig> carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group interacts with asn209; the glycerol o <dig> hydroxyl oxygen interacts with the imidazole nitrogen of trp <dig>  phe <dig> provides a hydrophobic platform supporting the glycerol carbons  that are ~4 Å away, and also forms part of the hydrophobic pocket accommodating the acetamido methyl group. a number of water molecules are seen to bridge interactions between neu5ac and the protein. details of the major interactions between spcbm and ligand are listed in table  <dig> fig.  <dig> stereo view of neu5ac binding sites of spcbm. 3’sl is shown in yellow carbon atoms and waters are shown in magenta. spcbm residues that are involved in the interaction are shown in stick representation with green carbon atoms. hydrogen bonds are shown as black dotted lines



acidic cavity adjacent to sialic acid binding site
a striking feature of the protein is a deep, negatively charged cavity adjacent to the sialic acid binding site . this pocket is formed by four residues , and is occupied by a lysine from a symmetry-related molecule . interestingly, a region immediately adjacent to this pocket and to the sialic acid binding site is highlighted by the results of the meta-ppisp server as a likely protein interaction site . no other protein binding sites on spcbm are predicted, and no such sites are predicted on the cbms of nanb, nanl or nanh. nanj cbm has a low-scoring patch in a region that overlaps with the corresponding patch on spcbm.fig.  <dig> potential functional cavity of spcbm. a the surface electrostatic view from the top of the binding site of spcbm and a cavity adjacent to the active site, which is occupied by a lysine from a symmetry related molecule . b close-up view of the interaction between the lysine and the protein. the solvent-accessible surface of spcbm is coloured based on the electrostatic potential from − <dig>  to + <dig>  kt/e, calculated using the apbs tool in pymol  <cit>

discussion
cbm <dig> domains have been described structurally for other sialidases from vibrio cholerae nanh  <cit> , clostridium perfringens nanj  <cit> , s. pneumoniae nanb  <cit>  and macrobdella decora nanl  <cit> , with sialic acid binding only visualised in the first two. the cbm <dig> domains all share a common lectin β-sandwich fold with two antiparallel β-sheets containing five and six strands, in addition to other secondary structural elements. the sialic acid binding site is located in the concave surface of the five-stranded sheet, although the nature of the ligand interactions in the sialic acid complexes with v. cholerae nanh and c. perfringens nanj are quite different and the binding sites are at different locations on the concave surface.

in their description of c. perfringens nanj, boraston et al. pointed out that there appear to be two subfamilies within the cbm <dig> family, one typified by c. perfringens nanj and the other by v. cholerae nanh  <cit> . the structure of spcbm confirms that it belongs to the subfamily that includes c. perfringens nanj and also s. pneumoniae nanb and m. decora nanl cbms.

previous reports mentioned that certain sialic acid binding residues from c. perfringens nanj cbm  were conserved in closely related cbms from s. pneumoniae nanb and m. decora nanl but differed in nana cbm. however, an alignment based on the spcbm structure reveals that these residues are, in fact, conserved and correspond to nana residues glu <dig> and arg <dig>  other residues in the immediate area  are also conserved and form very similar interactions as arg <dig> and tyr <dig> in nanj. in s. pneumoniae nanb, residues corresponding to nana glu <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and tyr <dig> are conserved and adopt very similar positions to that of nana, suggesting that nanb is likely to bind sialic acid in a similar manner.

the binding mode in the region of the glycerol moiety is somewhat different in nanj cbm and spcbm. in spcbm, a hydrogen bond is formed between trp <dig> and the c- <dig> hydroxyl, whereas the corresponding residue in nanj  cannot make this interaction, instead forming a different h-bond to the glycerol group via asn <dig>  the space filled by this asn side chain, along with the adjacent residue tyr <dig>  is not occupied by any residues in the corresponding area of spcbm or nanb, creating a more open binding pocket in the streptococcal proteins.

from binding affinity analysis, the dissociation constant, kd for spcbm-3’sl interaction was found to be in the affinity range similar to that measured for the isolated cbm <dig> from v. cholerae nanh interacting with 3’sl  as determined by surface plasmon resonance   <cit> . this suggests that the sialic acid binding pocket of both cbm40s may be similar. on examination of the residues involved in sialic acid binding by vccbm  <cit> , both cbm40s involve a comparable number of direct and water-mediated interactions that target the sialic acid moiety alone, despite the overall topology of the binding sites being different between them.

besides the classic function of binding to sialic acid, nana was reported to enhance the s. pneumoniae interaction with human brain microvascular endothelial cells  via an adhesin function of nana-cbm, which can potentially facilitate the entry of bacterial pathogens into the central nervous system , even with little contribution of the sialidase activity  <cit> . however, it is still not completely clear which receptor in the hbmecs is important for this process, and how it could be recognized by nana-cbm. in the current study, the surface electrostatic view shows that there is a deep, negatively charged cavity with positively charged surface next to the sialic binding site , which is not present in the other family  <dig> cbms. of the four amino acids that form the cavity, only glu <dig> is conserved, whereas gln <dig>  asn <dig> and asn <dig> are present in a region of sequence that exhibits low homology in family  <dig> cbms, suggesting that this surface feature is exclusive to s. pneumoniae nana. the four residues interact with a lysine from a symmetry related molecule . therefore, it is possible that this region is important for s. pneumoniae nana cbm interaction with a host cell receptor. this proposed interaction site for a binding partner for nana cbm is supported by the output of the metappisp web server, which combines results from three different methods for predicting protein-protein interaction sites. the predicted region lies directly adjacent to the sialic acid binding site and the acidic pocket.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have determined the structure of the isolated form of cbm from s. pneumoniae nana, which has been identified as a family  <dig> cbm due to its ability to bind the terminal sialic acid of glycoconjugates. our findings suggest that this domain may enhance the virulence of nana by targeting and binding to a variety of linkage-independent sialic acid receptors that line the surface of respiratory epithelial cells. further experiments to determine the nana binding partner are ongoing. the spcbm domain, in addition to showing promise as a bio-therapeutic against respiratory pathogens  <cit> , is a potential drug target and may be exploited as part of a combinatorial drug design approach to inhibit nana attachment and catalysis.
