BACKGROUND
pigeon lactation was first noted in the literature in  <dig> when john hunter described pigeon milk as being like “..granulated white curd”  <cit> . this curd-like substance is produced in the crop of male and female pigeons and regurgitated to the young. like the mammary gland, the pigeon crop undergoes significant changes to the tissue structure during lactation. several histological studies have characterised these changes and determined that pigeon milk consists of desquamated, sloughed crop epithelial cells  <cit> . the process of pigeon milk production begins when the germinal cell layer of the crop rapidly proliferates in response to prolactin  <cit> , and this results in a convoluted, highly folded epithelial structure that then coalesces as it out-grows the vasculature, to form the nutritive cell layer that is sloughed off to produce the milk. this nutritive cell layer contains lipid-filled vacuoles  <cit> . the lipid content of pigeon milk consists mainly of triglycerides, along with phospholipids, cholesterol, free fatty acids, cholesterol esters and diglycerides  <cit> . the triglyceride content decreases across the lactation period, from  <dig> % of total lipid at day one, to  <dig> % at day  <dig>  whereas the other lipids increase, which suggests the cellular lipid content decreases towards the end of the lactation period, but the cell membrane-associated lipids remain constant  <cit> .

several studies have investigated the differences in gene expression between ‘lactating’ pigeon crop tissue and non-‘lactating’ crop tissue  <cit> . nearly three decades ago, horseman and pukac were the first to identify that mrna species differ in response to prolactin injection in the crop  <cit> . specifically, they identified and characterised gene expression and protein translation of the prolactin-responsive mrna anxicp <dig> and the non-prolactin-responsive isoform, anxicp <dig> <cit> . in addition, a recent global gene expression study in our laboratory  <cit>  showed that genes encoding products involved in triglyceride synthesis and tissue signalling were up-regulated in the ‘lactating’ crop. we proposed that the evolution of the processes that result in the production of pigeon milk has built upon the more general ability of avian keratinocytes to accumulate intracellular neutral lipids during the cornification of the epidermis  <cit>  in order to produce a nutritive substance for their young  <cit> .

the mechanism of avian epidermal cornification and lipid accumulation is not well-characterised. however, studies have shown that antibodies against mammalian cornification proteins, which are relatively well-characterised, can cross-react with avian and reptilian species  <cit> , which suggests similarities in cornification proteins amongst vertebrate species. cultured chicken keratinocytes have been shown to express beta-keratins , alpha-keratins  and the cornified envelope precursor genes envoplakin and periplakin, as well as accumulating neutral lipids  <cit> . mammalian keratinocytes differ from avian keratinocytes in that they are unable to accumulate intracellular neutral lipids  <cit> , and can express alpha-keratins  but not beta-keratins, which expanded from early archosaurians  <cit> . there are many cornification-associated proteins characterised from mammalian epidermal tissues. the proteins that form the cornified envelope include keratins, s <dig> proteins, small proline-rich proteins , late cornified envelope  proteins, annexins, involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, desmoplakin, envoplakin, periplakin, trichohyalin, cystatin a, elafin and repetin  <cit> . trans-glutaminase enzymes, some of which require cleavage by proteases and an increase in intracellular calcium concentration to become active, cross-link the cornified envelope proteins to form a ceramide lipid-coated protective barrier to the epidermis  <cit> . many of the cornified envelope genes are present in the “epidermal differentiation complex”  which was first identified on chromosome 1q <dig> in humans  <cit> . interestingly, the edc region has been identified in an avian species , and is linked to the genes for beta-keratins, but lacks the lce proteins  <cit> .

here we present an analysis of the pigeon crop transcriptome to show that pigeon milk production involves a specialised cornification process and de novo synthesis of lipids that accumulate intracellularly.

RESULTS
differentiation of the ‘lactating’ crop
immunohistological analysis of the proliferating cells of the pigeon crop in its resting state and during nesting demonstrated the morphological changes that occur in preparation for pigeon milk production . as the crop changed in preparation for lactation, the number and depth of rete pegs increased and the lamina propria became progressively more extended and narrow, which increased the surface area of the crop. during lactation the crop was highly proliferative, which resulted in the accumulation and sloughing of large tracts of cornified epithelium . all lactating parents in this study  fed their young every four hours over the lactation period. histology revealed a cycle of production and turnover of cornified epithelium over the four-hour period . the squabs milk intake reduced gradually toward the end of the lactation period, which lasted approximately fourteen days.

analysis of transcriptional changes over the lactation period compared to non-‘lactating’ crop revealed no differentially expressed probes at pre-hatch , large differences at hatch  and 2 days post-hatch  , and no difference above what could be expected by chance  at 10 days post-hatch   . any effect of sex was ruled out by comparing males to females at non-‘lactating’ and ‘lactating’ time points. there was no difference above what could be expected by chance .

cornification genes are differentially expressed in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop
analysis of cornification-associated genes in the draft pigeon genome identified an epidermal differentiation complex  on scaffolds  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . transcriptional analysis of these edc genes and other cornification-associated genes in the pigeon crop at time points  <dig> and + <dig> revealed differential expression of  <dig> genes in  <dig>  + <dig> or both ‘lactating’ pigeon crops compared with non-‘lactating’ crop . thirteen of these genes were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. notably, the majority of cornification-associated genes up-regulated in the ‘lactating’ crop were keratins, constituting eight of the thirteen up-regulated genes. five of these eight keratins were beta-keratins and three were alpha-keratins. conversely, eight of the  <dig> down-regulated cornification-associated genes were alpha-keratins, and none were beta-keratins. phylogenetic analysis of the beta-keratins , which were all part of the pigeon edc  separates them into several groups. feather, claw and scale keratins share a common ancestor related to chicken beta-keratin, from which feather keratins  formed their own clade, and claw  and scale keratins  formed another monophyletic clade. putative pigeon keratins formed three more clades not containing a chicken homolog, and orf 683_ <dig> formed a clade of its own. genbank ids of keratins with the highest amino acid identity to the pigeon keratins are found in additional file  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of the alpha-keratins separates them into type i and type ii . seven type i keratins and two type ii keratins were down-regulated, and two type ii keratins were up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop . notably, all of the type i putative pigeon keratins were constrained to scaffold <dig>  whereas the type i keratins included  <dig> putative genes on scaffold <dig> and two on scaffold <dig> . all of the chicken alpha-keratins had a closely related putative pigeon homolog.

aside from keratins, there were several other differentially expressed cornification-associated genes in the pigeon crop. up-regulated cornification-associated genes in the ‘lactating’ crop at  <dig> and + <dig> timepoints included transglutaminase  <dig> , s100-a <dig>  and the pigeon lactation-specific transcript, cp <dig> , and its isoform cp <dig> . probes on exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of transglutaminase  <dig> were up-regulated , whereas probes on exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated , which suggests it is likely to be alternatively spliced in the pigeon crop. the transglutaminase genes transglutaminase 6-like and tissue transglutaminase were also down-regulated by 2-fold and  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold, respectively. several of the s <dig> genes were down-regulated in the ‘lactating’ crop by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold, including s100-a14-like, s100-a16-like, s100-a9-like, s100-a <dig> and s100p . the annexin genes annexin a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> were down-regulated by  <dig>  to 21-fold . the envelope precursor protein-encoding genes desmoplakin, periplakin, envoplakin, epiplakin and sciellin and cystatin a were all down-regulated in the ‘lactating’ crop by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold .

the proteases calpain- <dig>  and calpain  <dig> isoform  <dig>  were up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop, whilst calpain- <dig> was down-regulated by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold. cathepsins h, c, b-like, s, z, l and d were all down-regulated by between  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold.

the epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial peptide encoding gene beta defensin  <dig> was up-regulated by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold in ‘lactating’ crop at timepoints  <dig> and + <dig>  respectively .

differential expression of cornification-associated genes in the cornified epithelial cells of the pigeon crop
analysis of differentially expressed cornification-associated genes revealed that six genes were up-regulated and none were down-regulated in the cornified cell layer compared to the underlying cell layers . the most highly up-regulated gene was cornulin , followed by cp <dig> . ly, transglutaminase 6-like , annexin a <dig> , s100-a9-like , and s100-a16-like  were up-regulated in cornified cells.

triglyceride synthesis is up-regulated in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop
examination of lipid droplets in ‘lactating’ pigeon crop showed that lipid was present throughout the differentiated epithelium, and was perinuclear . to investigate whether lipids could potentially be synthesised de novo, the expression of genes linked to milk lipid synthesis in the mouse mammary gland  <cit>  were examined in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop. thirty-four mouse mammary gland-linked lipid synthesis genes were differentially expressed in the pigeon crop, including  <dig> variants of genes investigated in the mouse study. expression patterns of milk lipid synthesis genes were similar in pigeon crop and mouse mammary gland, although pigeon crop expressed different variants of many genes of the triglyceride synthesis and fatty acid synthesis pathways in comparison to the mouse mammary gland. in particular, the triglyceride synthesis genes agpat <dig> and dgat <dig> were up-regulated in the lactating mouse mammary gland compared to pregnant mouse mammary gland  <cit> , whereas agpat <dig>  agpat <dig> and dgat <dig> were up-regulated in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop compared to non-‘lactating’ crop. the fatty acid synthesis gene elovl <dig> was up-regulated in lactating mouse  <cit> , whereas elovl <dig> was up-regulated in ‘lactating’ pigeon crop. the lactating mouse mammary gland showed up-regulation of  <dig> different fabp gene variants, whereas the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop up-regulated only fabp <dig>  both lactating mouse and pigeon crop showed up-regulation of the same fatty acid transporter gene, slc27a <dig>  the fatty acid translocase, cd <dig>  and down-regulation of fatty acid transporter slc27a <dig> 

discussion
this is the first genome-wide pigeon crop transcriptome study to investigate the molecular mechanism of pigeon milk production. here we show that differential expression of cornification-associated proteins and de novo lipid synthesis genes in the pigeon crop during lactation contribute to a highly specialised process that leads to the production of pigeon milk.

in preparation for lactation, the pigeon crop increases in surface area through an increase in rete pegs and extension of the lamina propria . this hyperplasia followed by desquamation results in large numbers of lipid-rich differentiated cells accumulating in the crop lumen, in the form of a curd-like substance, which provides nourishment for the young . although the process of terminal differentiation, from the basal layer through to the desquamated layer takes days in mammals  <cit> , it appears that the epidermal cells of the pigeon crop undergo a terminal differentiation program within the space of four hours. we have previously described this histologically  <cit> . the 1004-fold up-regulation of cornulin and 15-fold up-regulation of transglutaminase  <dig> , both late epidermal differentiation markers  <cit> , in the cornified cell layer of the ‘lactating’ crop demonstrates the presence of terminally differentiated cells in the lactating pigeon crop epithelium.

up-regulation of several beta keratins and three alpha keratins in the ‘lactating’ crop  suggests an important function for keratin in the formation of pigeon milk. beta-keratins are specific to archosaurians  <cit> , and are found in the pigeon edc , whereas alpha-keratins are ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. phylogenetic analysis of the putative pigeon beta-keratins places the majority of up-regulated beta keratins in claw and scale beta keratin groups . beta-keratins have been suggested to have evolved from alpha-keratins to form a new class of matrix proteins that have a structural role in cornification  <cit> . hence, it appears that in addition to alpha-keratins, beta-keratins have an important structural role in ‘lactating’ pigeon crop cells. unlike alpha-keratins, beta-keratins form their own filament-matrix structures  <cit>  which negates the need to express matrix proteins to form cornified beta-keratin epidermis. the down-regulation in ‘lactating’ crop of the typical mammalian cornified envelope precursors desmoplakin, envoplakin, periplakin, sciellin and cystatin a  suggests that beta-keratins could play an alternative role to these matrix proteins in the ‘lactating’ crop.

alpha-keratins are cross-linked to matrix proteins by transglutaminase enzymes, which are activated by proteolytic cleavage and increased intracellular calcium concentration  <cit> . s <dig> proteins play a role in the establishment of the calcium gradient in epithelial cell layers  <cit>  and can also be substrates for transglutaminase themselves  <cit> . both transglutaminase and s <dig> protein-encoding genes are up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop . interestingly, prostate transglutaminase  is differentially expressed in ‘lactating’ crop. putative exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated, while seven other putative exons were up-regulated,  which suggests there could be multiple splice variants; this is the case for human transglutaminase  <dig> in cancer tissues  <cit> . in addition, transglutaminase  <dig>  which is expressed in mammalian cornifying epithelium  <cit>  is up-regulated . this is in contrast to mammalian cornifying tissues that express transglutaminases  <dig> and  <dig> in addition to transglutatminase  <dig> <cit> . the up-regulation of the proteases calpain- <dig> and calpain  <dig> isoform  <dig> in the ‘lactating’ crop  could suggest a role for these enzymes in the proteolytic activation of transglutaminases  <dig> and  <dig>  as calpains are thought to activate transglutaminase  <dig>  <cit> . additionally, cathepsin d has been suggested as an activator of transglutaminase, but this does not appear to be the case in the pigeon crop, as cathepsin d and six other cathepsin genes are down-regulated .

in addition to being a substrate for transglutaminase, s <dig> proteins can interact with annexins and form part of the cornified envelope  <cit> . s100-a <dig> is up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop, as are the pigeon lactation-specific annexin gene cp <dig> and its isoform cp <dig> , which could indicate roles for these genes in the formation of the cornified envelope. cp <dig> is expressed 20-fold higher in cornified cells of the ‘lactating’ crop, which suggests it has a function in the cornified cells, along with the s <dig> protein-encoding genes s100-a16-like and s100-a9-like .

accumulation of neutral lipids in keratinocytes is a unique trait of avian species  <cit> . the pigeon makes use of this ability in the crop to produce a lipid-rich milk  <cit>  for the young. it was suggested by garrison and scow  <cit>  that the lipids in pigeon milk were sequestered from another organ due to the increase in lipoprotein lipase activity in the prolactin-stimulated crop. we have also shown previously that there is up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidation of imported triglycerides  <cit> , and in this study we found that lipoprotein lipase was up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop . however, the current study showed that lipid synthesis in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop is a combination of importation and de novo synthesis of lipids, and results in the perinuclear accumulation of neutral lipid droplets .

table  <dig> shows that genes involved in triglyceride synthesis in the mouse mammary gland during lactation  <cit>  are also differentially expressed in the ‘lactating’ crop. the majority of genes involved in de novo lipid synthesis in the mouse are also expressed in the pigeon, but there are three gene variants that are expressed in the pigeon and not in the mouse. the pigeon expresses agpat <dig>  agpat <dig> and dgat  <dig> , whereas the mouse expresses agpat <dig> and dgat <dig> <cit> , which suggests that both the mechanism of lipid synthesis and crop cornification in the pigeon varies from that of mammals. the differences in the specific combinations of genes expressed may be reflected in the differences in triglycerides produced by each species. amongst mammalian species there are differences in the fatty acid composition of milk triglycerides  <cit> . however, a comparison of the major fatty acid components of pigeon milk; oleic acid, linoleic acid and palmitic acid  <cit> , reveals these are also the major fatty acid components of mammalian milk fat. there is a difference in the expression of elovl genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in the mouse mammary gland and in the pigeon crop . in mouse and human, the elovl <dig> gene is up-regulated during lactation  <cit> , whereas the pigeon crop up-regulates elovl <dig> during lactation . it has been shown that de novo synthesis of fatty acids in the mammary gland can change in response to dietary availability  <cit> . therefore, the difference in elovl gene expression between mammals and pigeons could be due to differences in the dietary availability of triglycerides/fatty acids in the pigeon diet. elovl <dig>  up-regulated in ‘lactating’ crop, has been shown to have high elongation activity on c16: <dig> long chain fatty acids, and also some activity on c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> long chain fatty acids  <cit> , which are the major fatty acid components of pigeon milk. this suggests that a large proportion of pigeon milk fatty acids could be synthesised de novo in the crop. one of the major differences between pigeon milk fatty acids and mammalian milk fatty acids is the lack of very long chain fatty acids, which are synthesised de novo by elovl <dig>  <cit> .

here we have shown that pigeon milk is the result of a specialised cornification process that produced large numbers of lipid-laden, cornified cells with a very rapid four hour cycle of hyperplasia followed by desquamation in the ‘lactating’ pigeon crop.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has expanded our knowledge of pigeon milk production, in particular, the mechanism of cornification and lipid production in the crop. pigeon lactation is a highly specialised process that utilises the normal keratinocyte cellular processes to produce a targeted nutrient solution for the young at a very high turnover rate.
