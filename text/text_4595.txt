BACKGROUND
the apolipoprotein l <dig> gene  has been the focus of considerable interest in recent years because of the discovery of two coding genetic variants  that dramatically increase recessive risk of kidney diseases among african americans  . interestingly, these variants are specific to african ancestry populations, in which they are common. it is thought that these variants rose to high frequency because they provide protection from african sleeping sickness, although it has been suggested that selection for the g <dig> allele may reflect a broader protective effect against pathogens  <cit> . while the association between apol <dig> variants and kidney disease has been confirmed for nephropathies of differing etiologies, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  <cit> , hiv-associated nephropathy  <cit> , hypertension-attributed end-stage kidney disease   <cit> , severe lupus nephritis  <cit> , and chronic kidney disease  progression  <cit> , the biological mechanism by which apol <dig> variants influence renal function has not been elucidated. understanding the underlying relationships could have significant impact as it may suggest treatment options for those with  these risk variants.

high density lipoprotein cholesterol  has been positively associated with kidney function and inversely with ckd risk  . the atheroprotective properties of the hdl particle may also protect glomerular cells from damage and subsequent kidney dysfunction . in a preliminary analysis, our group has shown that the association between hdlc and estimated glomerular filtration rate , differed depending on the genotype at rs <dig> which, along with a snp in near-perfect ld , defines the apol <dig> g <dig> haplotype  <cit> . specifically, among individuals with the gg genotype for rs <dig> , higher hdlc was associated with lower egfr, while there was no association among those without this genotype. the initial observation was made in the howard university family study , a study of aas designed to be representative of the general aa population living in washington, dc. to further understand this relationship, we evaluated the apol1 × hdlc interaction in aa from two additional studies: the natural history of apol1-associated nephropathy study   <cit>  and the atherosclerosis risk in communities study   <cit> .

methods
participants and design
this analysis included aa individuals from the howard university family study , the natural history of apol1-associated nephropathy study , and the atherosclerosis risk in communities study . briefly, hufs is a study of aa that was designed to be representative of the general population of aa living in washington, dc  <cit> . nhaan is a study of aa first-degree relatives of patients with non-diabetic eskd  <cit> . aric was designed as a multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis and recruited individuals aged 45– <dig> years in forsyth county, nc; jackson, ms; the suburbs of minneapolis, mn; and washington county, md  <cit> . this analysis only includes aas from this study. aric data was accessed through the database of genotypes and phenotypes   <cit>  , specifically the geneva substudy , through an approved request for controlled-access data. included studies were approved by the institutional review boards of howard university , wake forest school of medicine , and, for aric, the university of north carolina at chapel hill, johns hopkins university, university of mississippi medical center, wake forest university, university of minnesota, brigham and women's hospital, and baylor college of medicine. individuals with t2d or ckd  were excluded from analysis given dyslipidemia associated with these conditions.

measurements
in all studies, hdlc was determined using standard enzymatic procedures . serum creatinine levels were determined using a buffered kinetic jaffé reaction without deproteinization on a cobas integra  <dig> plus analyzer  for hufs. in nhaan, serum creatinine was measured using creatinase enzymatic spectrophotometry . for aric, serum creatinine levels  were determined using the modified kinetic jaffé method  <cit>  . for all studies, egfr was calculated according to the race- and gender-specific chronic kidney disease collaboration equations  <cit> .

genotyping
genotyping at the apol <dig> locus has been previously described for both hufs  <cit>  and nhaan  <cit> . for aric, imputed genotype data for rs <dig> was accessed , as well as genome-wide genotype data  for the calculation of african ancestry proportion. the “best guess” genotypes based on the imputation were used in the analysis. in hufs, population structure was assessed by principal component analysis using eigensoft  <cit> , with the first pc, which represents african ancestry proportion, retained as previously described  <cit> . african ancestry proportion was calculated using ancestry informative markers in nhaan. in aric, african ancestry proportion was estimated using admixture  <cit>  with k =  <dig> and random markers. hapmap <dig> yri and ceu samples were added to the aric samples to improve the estimations.

statistical analyses
hdlc was log-transformed in all analyses. as in the previous analysis, rs <dig> was coded recessively: those with the gg  genotype were compared with individuals with the ag or aa genotypes. the interaction between hdlc and rs <dig> was evaluated in a linear regression model with a multiplicative interaction term . in each model evaluating the interaction term, terms for the main effect of hdlc and rs <dig> were included. the presented pinteraction is the p-value for the hdlc × rs <dig> term. the multiplicative interaction term was calculated using mean-centered variables to avoid collinearity. all models were adjusted for age, gender, bmi, genome-wide proportion african ancestry, and study along with the random effect of family . all analyses were conducted using sas  <dig>  . figures were produced using data from a least squares means statement within the models , such that the models predicted egfr given a particular value of hdlc  and genotype  with all other terms set to their mean values. the points obtained from these conditions were then plotted using r . while all models used log-transformed hdlc as a predictor, to produce a more easily interpretable figure, the log of clinically meaningful hdlc values were input into the ls means statement and figure axes describe the relationship in mg/dl.

in previous analysis, an interaction between hdlc and the g <dig> variant  on egfr was not observed; however, as most studies of apol <dig> evaluate the combined genotype of g <dig>  and g <dig> as the total number of variant alleles at this locus, we also investigated the combined genotype and g <dig> separately, as follows. first, we modeled the interaction term as described above, but with the apol <dig> risk genotype defined as those with two copies of variant alleles for either g <dig> or g <dig> . for comparison, we also modeled the interaction term rs <dig>  × hdlc. as the g <dig> allele was not available in aric, these models only included hufs and nhaan participants.

RESULTS
included participants are described in table  <dig>  the frequency of the gg genotype in hufs was similar to what was observed among aas in the exome sequencing projects . the frequency in nhaan was more than twice that, consistent with ascertainment of first-degree relatives of patients with non-diabetic eskd enriching for the genetic risk factor. in aric, the gg frequency was lower than expected. although the imputation score for this variant was good , this distribution may reflect the fact that rs <dig> was imputed in aric . the distribution of egfr was consistent with an age effect, with higher values observed in the studies with younger participants. as expected given national statistics for aas, mean bmi for each study indicates a high degree of overweight and obesity, with substantially higher mean bmi observed among women.table  <dig> participant characteristics by study

the association between hdlc and egfr varied based on genotype . among the  <dig> individuals with the gg genotype, a steep inverse association between hdlc and egfr was observed . in contrast, among the  <dig> individuals with the aa or ag genotype, a positive association was observed . notably, among those with rs <dig> aa/ag, the observed hdlc-egfr association was similar to what we previously observed among non-african ancestry individuals  <cit> . when each study was considered separately , similar interactions were observed in hufs  and nhaan . the association in aric, however, was quite different , with the slope of the association greatly attenuated among gg individuals compared to what was observed in hufs and nhaan. given that participants in aric were older than in hufs and nhaan, we hypothesized that the difference in the interaction might be a function of age. we tested this hypothesis in the full sample with an interaction term for hdlc × rs73885319 × age, with age represented as a binary variable contrasting those ≥55 years with those <55 years. the 3-way interaction term for hdlc × rs73885319 × age was statistically significant . when individuals ≥55 years were excluded, the association in aric was more similar to what was observed for hufs and nhaan ; however, there were only  <dig> gg individuals remaining, and the interaction did not reach statistical significance . when hufs, nhaan, and aric were jointly analyzed excluding older individuals, the interaction was similar to that in the full set, but more statistically significant .fig.  <dig> association between egfr and hdlc by rs <dig> genotype in african americans. plots from a model of egfr as predicted by rs73885319 × hdlc, adjusted for rs <dig>  hdlc, age, bmi, sex, genome-wide proportion african ancestry, study , and the random effect of family. a. all african americans; b. howard university family study ; c. natural history of apol1-associated nephropathy study ; d. atherosclerosis risk in communities study

apol <dig> effects are generally described in terms of “number of risk variants,” a collapsing of variation at the g <dig> and g <dig> haplotypes. rs <dig>  evaluated in this study, effectively captures the g <dig> haplotype, as the other g <dig> snp, rs <dig>  is in near-perfect ld with rs <dig> . we also considered g <dig> separately and with g <dig>  in this analysis. these analyses were limited to the hufs and nhaan datasets . no interaction was observed with the g <dig> haplotype . when number of apol <dig> risk variants were evaluated, the interaction was weaker than was observed with rs <dig> on its own . the results from this coding are consistent with the dilution of the rs <dig> interaction by including g <dig> table  <dig> evaluation of the interaction between apol <dig> risk variants and hdlc on egfr among african americans1

to be sure that the recessive coding of rs <dig> was appropriate, we also evaluated the addition of an interaction term for heterozygotes  to the model . the regression coefficient  for the rs <dig> ag × hdlc term was neither intermediate  nor similar to that of the rs <dig> gg × hdlc term . it was not statistically significant  and the inclusion of this term did not affect the size or significance of the rs <dig> gg × hdlc term; thus, we feel confident that the interaction pertains only to individuals with the gg genotype, and the recessive coding best fits our data.

to evaluate the robustness of the rs73885319 × hdlc findings to analytic strategy, we conducted sensitivity analyses. first, since dyslipidemia frequently occurs jointly with t2d and ckd, individuals with these conditions were excluded to limit their influence on hdlc. when these individuals were included, the interaction remained statistically significant, though attenuated . second, the choice of an appropriate kidney function measure can be debated. while we describe results using egfr as estimated by the chronic kidney disease collaboration equations  <cit> , similar interactions were observed when using egfr calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease study equations  <cit>  or with serum creatinine concentration . finally, there was no difference in rs73885319 × hdlc interaction by gender .

discussion
in  <dig>  african american participants from three independent studies , we demonstrated that the association between hdlc and egfr is significantly influenced by the kidney risk genotype  at rs <dig> in the apol <dig> gene. among the  <dig> individuals with the gg genotype, a steep inverse association between hdlc and egfr was observed. in contrast, among the  <dig> individuals with the aa or ag genotype, hdlc was positively associated with egfr. the mechanism underlying this apol1 × hdlc interaction is not clear. a potential explanation that has been recently suggested  <cit>  is that rs <dig> directly or indirectly leads to qualitative changes in the hdl particle that render it dysfunctional in terms of its protective properties. while hdl is generally characterized as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant particle, under certain conditions, including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus , metabolic syndrome, and kidney disease , it loses some of its beneficial properties, potentially becoming pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant. the generally protective function of the hdl particle is attributed to its role in reverse cholesterol transport as well as to the lipid and protein components of which it is composed. hdl is a heterogeneous macromolecular complex that contains more than  <dig> proteins and peptides, more than  <dig> lipid species, and several micrornas  <cit> . the distribution of these components is responsive to a variety of biological changes, such as inflammation and oxidative stress  <cit> . during the acute phase response, for instance, hdl was shown to have reduced apoa-i levels and paraoxonase activity and increased ceruloplasmin   <cit> . hdl proteomic remodeling was observed in patients with coronary artery disease; compared to the hdl from healthy individuals, the hdl from patients had higher apoc-iii and lower clustering, and stimulated endothelial pro-apoptotic pathways  <cit> . in the nurses’ health study and the health professionals’ follow-up study, hdl proteomic differences, specifically apoc-iii presence or absence, determined the direction of association between hdl and cardiovascular disease risk, with the hdl/apoc-iii complex associated with increased risk  <cit> . with such findings, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that the measurement of hdlc, the cholesterol content of the hdl particle, is simply a proxy for particle number, and does not represent the particle’s proteome and lipidome, which may be more important in terms of disease risk. it is expected that studies evaluating the content of hdl particles in a more refined way would be informative for the interaction observed in this study.

differences in the rs73885319 × hdlc interaction were seen by age. an older age could represent increased oxidative stress and inflammation, among other factors. while we were not able to further evaluate the underlying mechanism of this difference in these studies, one potential explanation is that aging influences the composition and/or function of the hdl particle in ways that are relevant for this interaction. aging has been previously associated with decreased hdl-mediated reverse cholesterol transport  <cit> , hdl antioxidant activity  <cit> , and pon <dig> activity, irrespective of changes in pon <dig> or hdlc concentration  <cit> . thus, in the context of hdl with decreased protective capacity as observed with aging, apol1-influenced changes to hdl quality may be more difficult to detect.

it would be reasonable to suspect that the observed modification of the association between hdlc and egfr by rs <dig> may be relevant for cardiovascular disease risk, as hdlc has generally been associated with improved cardiovascular health and apol <dig> kidney disease risk variants have been associated with increased cvd risk  <cit>  . it may be hypothesized that if rs <dig> contributes directly or indirectly to qualitative changes in the hdl particle that alter the relationship between hdl and kidney function, those changes might also affect the association between hdlc and cvd-related outcomes in unexpected ways. given the uncertainty regarding the underlying biological mechanisms that this statistical interaction captures, it is difficult to speculate what may be observed.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study confirms and extends the earlier observation that the association between hdlc and egfr differs depending on rs <dig> genotype at the apol <dig> kidney disease locus. among individuals with the rs <dig> gg  genotype, higher hdlc was associated with lower egfr, while a positive association was observed among those without this genotype. in this analysis, a modulatory effect of age on the rs73885319 × hdlc interaction was observed, such that the interaction was attenuated among older individuals. functional studies are needed to reveal the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this interaction.
