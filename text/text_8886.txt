BACKGROUND
mycobacterium bovis, bacilli calmette-guérin  has been widely administered to newborns throughout the world showing to be effective in the prevention of childhood tuberculosis  but not in the reactivation of pulmonary disease or human immunodeficiency virus-associated tb. development of a more effective, standardized, affordable vaccine with durable activity and fewer side effects has been considered a major international public health priority. the need to develop new vaccines is supported by some recent information: 1- data on the natural history and immunology of infection with m. tuberculosis; 2- reanalysis of the role of nontuberculous mycobacteria in protection against tb; 3- the understanding of bcg limitations; and 4- the development of molecular techniques that have permitted the identification of immunodominant antigens and new methods of antigen delivery. vaccine types under investigation against tb include attenuated or enhanced live whole-cell, inactivated whole-cell, subunit, virus-vectored and dna vaccines, followed by several immunization strategies, as prime-boost protocols. several of these candidate vaccines have demonstrated activity in animal models that is equal or superior to that of bcg, and trials in human subjects are currently under way  <cit> .we have previously demonstrated that a dna vaccine encoding the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein  protected mice and guinea pigs from challenge with a virulent strain of m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and cured previously infected mice when administered as naked dna by intramuscular injection  <cit> . we have also shown that the therapeutic use of dna-hsp <dig> in combination with antimycobacterial drugs shortens the duration of the tb treatment, improves the treatment of latent tb infection, and is effective against multi-drug resistant tb  <cit> .

in spite of some isolated negative experimental results  <cit> , dna vaccines have in general proved to be safe and well tolerated in preclinical and clinical studies  <cit> . the naked plasmid dna molecules have not caused any adverse effects on the biochemical and hematological blood values and have caused neither detectable organ pathology nor systemic toxicity  <cit> . in addition, there has been no evidence of autoimmunity, development of anti-nuclear or double-stranded dna antibodies, or plasmid dna  integration into chromosomes  <cit> . although this approach has been shown to be highly effective in several experimental models, in general a large amount of pdna administered several times is required to induce this protective immune response. the injection of naked pdna could lead to its degradation resulting in a reduced transfection efficiency into apcs  <cit> . moreover, in early studies of dna vaccines, experimental data showed that rodents injected with foreign genes expressed antigens, produced antibodies, showed cell-mediated immune responses and achieved protective and long-lasting immunity  <cit> . however, as these vaccines moved into primate studies and human safety trials, excitement waned. in primate trials, naked dna failed to generate a successful response  <cit> . similar results were observed in our own studies: when we tested the ability of the naked dna-hsp <dig> preparation to prevent tb infection in cattle, we did not observe the immunogenicity seen in our mouse model . we have therefore pursued various strategies that allow the use of lower amounts of pdna with the preservation of the immune protective effects and a simplified vaccination scheme.

recent approaches to improving the performance of dna vaccines involves the use of a wide range of adjuvants and delivery systems  <cit> . our group has been working on an improvement of dna-hsp <dig> vaccination using a drug delivery system. we have previously shown that the intramuscular injection of plga  microspheres containing  <dig> μg of dna has controlled tb in mice and guinea-pigs  <cit> . another strategy for dna delivery is the utilization of cationic liposomes. since the description of liposome in  <dig> by bangham et al.  <cit> , several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this structure as a delivery system for drugs, peptides, proteins, and dna. currently, liposomes are recognized as efficient immunoadjuvants, improving the immune response to various antigens  <cit> . as drug carriers, liposomes are biocompatibile, easy to prepare, and have several formulations that have been approved for clinical application  <cit> . gregoriadis and colleagues  <cit>  developed a functional cationic liposome entrapping a dna vaccine encoding the s  region of the hepatitis b surface antigen , that induced an effective immune response. these liposomes had a 16: <dig> μmol epc:dope  ratio and the cationic lipid dotap  in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> μmol, with the mean diameter of  <dig> nm. nonetheless, when the dna was complexed on the surface of liposomes with the above-mentioned composition, the resulting liposomes were too large  and could not be used in the in vivo assays  <cit> . by making changes to these protocols, we achieved a 10: <dig> molar charge ratio  in our liposomes, which resulted in a mean diameter around  <dig> μm. these liposomes were evaluated using different immunization routes and doses to detect the level of protection against m. tuberculosis challenge. our results showed that the cationic liposomes when complexed with dna-hsp <dig>  had similar effects to naked dna regarding protection against tb. two main advantages of our new formulation are the 16-fold reduction of the amount of dna used and the one-time administration by a non-invasive intranasal route. remarkably, histological examination of the lungs in animals immunized with comp-hsp <dig> has revealed minimal granulomatous lesions with evidence of lesion healing and airway remodeling after challenge. we believe that this strategy can be applied to vaccination against tb in a single dose or in prime-boost protocols, with the potential to positively impact the control of this infectious disease.

RESULTS
liposomes are cationic, with different morphologies and appropriate mean size for use in in vivo assays
 mean ± standard deviation . liposome composition- epc:dotap:dope 50:25: <dig> molar. liposomes containing dna-hsp <dig> at molar charge ratio 1: <dig> . diameter measurements were done in independent samples: n =  <dig> for liposomes complexed with dna-hsp <dig> and n =  <dig> for liposomes entrapping dna-hsp <dig> and empty liposomes.

 percentages refer to distribution number-weighted of particles.

 mean ± standard deviation . zeta potential measurements in three independent samples 

the zeta potential of the structures was similar and showed positive values, indicating that the colloidal structures were cationic . these results indicate that for a 10: <dig> molar charge ratio , the association of dna does not influence the zeta potential. both the colloidal structures were stable in terms of mean diameter and size distribution during storage at 8°c, for  <dig> months .

transmission electron microscopy using negative-staining techniques were used to investigate the morphology of the structures. figure  <dig> represents the electronic micrograph of the three liposome preparations. the results confirm our previous evaluation of mean diameter and size distribution. the empty liposomes  appear to be spherical with diameter similar to the main population  <dig> nm obtained by pcs. the larger structures observed in the figure 1a could be generated by aggregation due to the dehydration-rehydration process and are in accordance with the second population identified by pcs and dynamic light scattering measurements. in comparison to entr-hsp <dig> , the micrographs of comp-hsp <dig>  show the much higher density of dna associated with the surface of liposomes. the images also demonstrated that comp-hsp <dig> liposomes are larger structures than entr-hsp <dig> liposomes, confirming the mean diameter and size distribution measurements.

liposomes are non-cytotoxic when added to cell cultures
as our main goal was to perform in vivo assays with liposome formulations in mice, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of these structures compared to naked dna . using the mtt assay, j <dig> cells were transfected with each of the liposome formulations  or with naked hsp <dig> showing more than 60% of cell viability even with high concentrations of dna . since our formulations exhibited no difference in toxicity when compared with naked dna, except for the highest concentration analyzed for blank  liposome and entr-hsp <dig>  these carriers were selected to perform in vivo assays with the dose of  <dig> μg of pdna.

immunization with liposomes carrying dna-hsp <dig> induces antibody production of th <dig> pattern
since the liposomes were not toxic to cells, we analyzed the immunogenic potential of our structures beginning with the evaluation of antibody production after immunization. thirty days after injection with four doses of naked dna or a single dose of liposomes, we analyzed the presence of two subtypes of anti-hsp <dig> antibodies in serum of balb/c mice. as shown in figure  <dig>  naked dna induced a mixed pattern of immune response as previously observed, with igg <dig> and igg2a production. interestingly, we observed a polarized pattern of antibody production after immunization with cationic liposomes carrying hsp <dig>  with exclusive igg2a subtype production using only  <dig> μg of dna, suggesting a th <dig> immune response pattern. however, this igg2a level was lower than the level induced by naked dna immunization.

the route and dose of immunization drive the level of protection against m. tuberculosis
although a single intramuscular dose of entr-hsp <dig> or comp-hsp <dig> induces modulation of the immune system, these formulations do not prevent tb infection in mice when compared with the classic dna vaccine . the next step was to evaluate the protection against m. tuberculosis using different doses and routes of immunization. we attempted to improve the activity of liposomes by using two intramuscular doses of these preparations. this strategy showed a slight colony forming units  reduction, but overall it was not effective. however, when we delivered comp-hsp <dig> intranasally in a single dose  a higher protection was observed, with a significant reduction of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  log in the bacterial load between the saline group and comp-hsp <dig>  this cfu reduction was the same as we observed when we vaccinated intramuscularly with four doses  of naked hsp <dig> and also similar to results with bcg immunization . thus intranasal delivery of comp-hsp <dig> afforded effective protection in mice using a lower dna dose. additionally, four doses of naked hsp <dig> delivered intranasally did not induce reduction of bacilli number in the lungs .

protection conferred by comp-hsp <dig> was followed by histological examination
histological analysis of lung sections from the saline control group  showed tissue damage caused by severe inflammation, with few lymphocyte infiltrations and high numbers of foamy macrophages. in contrast, mice that were immunized with comp-hsp <dig> exhibited smaller pneumonic areas with a cell infiltrate containing a predominance of lymphocytes and macrophages. moreover, the morphometric analysis  showed that 70% of the lung was damaged in the saline control group, while in mice immunized with comp-hsp <dig> lung damage was reduced to 30%. these effects of liposome immunization were comparable to those induced by naked hsp <dig> and bcg.

the protection of comp-hsp <dig> could be related to a th <dig> skewed immune response
since certain cytokines play an important role in the immune response to m. tuberculosis, we investigated the pattern of cytokine production in the lungs of mice from saline controls and mice immunized according to protocols that had shown protection, e.g., naked dna and comp-hsp <dig>  when mice were challenged with m. tuberculosis, we observed a th <dig> cytokine pattern with an increase of ifn-γ, il- <dig> and il- <dig> production when compared to uninfected animals . however, immunization with naked hsp <dig> and comp-hsp <dig> induced a significant increase of ifn-γ and a significant decrease in il- <dig> compared to saline control mice. il- <dig> expression was not altered by these immunization protocols. additionally, we did not observe differences in il- <dig> production among the groups .

discussion
our group has focused on the heat shock protein produced by mycobacterium leprae  as a vaccine antigen against several pathologies including tb, leishmaniasis  <cit> , diabetes, arthritis  <cit>  and cancer. the success of hsp <dig> vaccination in these different diseases reflects its effectiveness as an immunodominant antigen, and also suggests that it possesses hsp-dependent properties, such as causing the formation of peptide-hsp complexes  <cit> . when dna-hsp <dig> was used to vaccinate mice intramuscularly it elicited an effective immune response only at high dna doses, which we postulate were necessary because of the loss of a considerable amount of injected pdna via deoxyribonuclease degradation. to circumvent this problem, drug carriers such as microspheres or liposomes have been developed which protect dna from extracellular enzymes and could improve dna vaccination results.

here we showed that cationic liposomes could be used as delivery system for low doses of dna-hsp <dig>  causing protection equivalent to that of naked dna against m. tuberculosis. most important were the findings that the use of liposomes resulted in a 16-fold reduction in the amount of dna used in the immunization and that this could be administered in a single dose through a non-invasive route.

the physico-chemical characterization of liposomes containing dna entrapped or complexed on the surface demonstrated that these structures have positive zeta potential. this cationic characteristic supports dna delivery to the cells since the driving force for the binding of lipid structures to the negatively charged cell membrane is electrostatic  <cit> . furthermore, different dna-liposome association methods produced liposomes with different characteristics of mean diameter and morphology. our findings are in accordance with the studies of perrie and colleagues  <cit> , which described the dna localization in dehydrated-hydrated vesicles obtained by entrapping or complexing methods. the entrapping process distributes the dna along the bilayers and the complexing concentrates the dna on the external surface of the vesicle. however the mean size obtained in our study with complexed dna on the liposome surface was smaller than previously reported  <cit>  due to our modified protocol, rigid temperature control  and intense vortexing.

in vitro studies showed that our liposome preparations are safe with low cytotoxicity even at high concentrations. also, in vivo studies showed that the immunization with liposomes skewed the antibodies production to igg2a without igg <dig> production, suggesting a polarization to th <dig> pattern of immune response. this profile is similar to previous data of our group injecting plga microspheres carrying dna-hsp <dig> plus trehalose  <dig> '-dimycolate  by intramuscular route  <cit> . results from immunization with naked hsp <dig> showed a mixed antibody response and levels of igg2a antibodies than seen with the liposome delivery system. these differences could be related to the amount of dna, the different doses or to the immunization route. however, the liposomes are the delivery vehicle of choice as they elicited th <dig> polarization without the use of additional adjuvant.

our analysis of different immunization protocols showed that one intramuscular dose  did not promote a significant reduction in cfu number . however, all groups immunized twice with liposome exhibited a slight reduction in bacterial growth, suggesting that the constituents of liposomes may have intrinsic immunostimulatory properties. to analyze a new route of delivery, we used the immunization through the nasal mucosa that provides a simple, non-invasive route to deliver dna vaccines stimulating mucosal immunity  <cit> . while this worked effectively for our liposome bearing dna-hsp <dig>  the intranasal delivery of naked dna was ineffective. possibly naked dna was destroyed by physical and chemical mucosal barriers that abrogate the gene transfection including endonucleases, enzymes present on mucus, low ph and fast elimination by ciliate epithelium  <cit> , a scenario that can be circumvented by liposomal carriers. furthermore, cationic liposomes have been proved to enhance immune response against pathogens  <cit>  including m. tuberculosis  <cit>  when administered intranasally. comp-hsp <dig> intranasal instillation conferred a significant impairment in bacilli growth that was comparable to  <dig> μg of naked dna injected by intramuscular route.

since the lipids and molar ratio of both liposomes were similar, the reason that only comp-hsp <dig> immunization achieved effective protection could be due to where the dna resides. the higher exposure of dna on the liposome surface in comp-hsp <dig> may favor the interaction of cpg motifs present in plasmid dna with receptors such as endogenous toll-like receptor  <dig>  leading to an activation of antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . another feature to be considered is that the diameter of the liposomes could influence the macrophage phagocytosis process, as showed by volle et al.  <cit> , which established a relation between the size of synthetic particles and phagocytosis efficacy, a result confirmed in rat alveolar macrophages  <cit> . related, we observed that mice immunized with larger particles  caused a significant reduction of cfu from infected lung tissue, suggesting that comp-hsp <dig> delivery improved the dna capture by immune competent cells. however, additional studies are required to test this hypothesis.

in addition to protecting against bacterial growth, new vaccines need to be evaluated for their ability to maintain the integrity of the tissues involved in the pathology. in our study, comp-hsp <dig> vaccination preserved the pulmonary parenchyma  and reduced tissue inflammation . therefore, liposomes complexed with dna-hsp <dig> showed the ability to stimulate the immune system in a manner that resulted in bacilli reduction and lung preservation. these effects could be due to cytokines present in the pulmonary parenchyma, as high levels of ifn-γ were detected in mice immunized with both naked hsp <dig> and comp-hsp <dig> . this finding suggests that comp-hsp <dig> is a promising vaccine, since a th <dig> immune response could be important for the development of protective immunity against m. tuberculosis infection  <cit> . on the other hand, production of the regulatory cytokine il- <dig> was reduced in vaccines that conferred effective protection against m. tuberculosis infection , when compared to non-immunized mice. this is particularly interesting because the role of il- <dig> in tb is controversial, since it has been reported that il-10-/- mice are not protected from infection  <cit>  while others showed that increases of il- <dig> expression leads to a down regulation of the immune response against tb  <cit> . indeed, our group recently showed that the evaluation of many immunological parameters is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying the immune response against tb  <cit> . in our model, it seems that a combination of the increase of ifn-γ expression and a decrease of il- <dig> expression improves the immune response leading to bacilli reduction and lung parenchyma preservation.

the utilization of cationic liposomes as a drug delivery system represents an advance for vaccine technology, which has been growing in recent years. liposomes delivering amphotericin b is used in the therapy of visceral leishmaniasis patients with great efficacy  <cit> . okada and colleagues showed 100% of survival in a cynomolgus monkey model infected with m. tuberculosis, using bcg plus dna-hsp <dig> vaccine carried by liposomes  <cit> . moreover, several articles pointed out the effects of dna-hsp <dig> immunization in different protocols and a study has been done to achieve an effective, cost-convenient and safest vaccination scheme . additionally, two dna vaccines for veterinary use  are in the market and there are several reports showing the safety of dna vaccines when tested in preclinical and clinical trials  <cit> . we recently tested dna-hsp <dig> vaccine in a phase i/ii clinical trial in cancer patients and the results showed no toxicity or autoimmunity reactions . considering that liposomes are currently used in medical products and dna vaccines are under development, their combination in tb vaccination offers a promising approach to fighting this disease.

CONCLUSIONS
here we showed effective protection against tb with a single immunogen delivered by a safe and efficient carrier system without any additional adjuvant. we achieved a 16-fold reduction in the plasmid dna amount administered in only one dose with the additional advantage of using a non-invasive route of administration . the data presented here show the importance of the proper association of the delivery method and the optimization of the route and dose used for immunization.
