BACKGROUND
cystic fibrosis  is a common inherited genetic disorder, caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  protein  <cit>  which is expressed in many different cells. in the lung, the derived chloride transport defect leads to altered airway physiology including impairment of mucociliary clearance, production of plugs of thick mucus and impaired innate immunity  <cit> . these defects predispose the cf patient to microbial colonization and thus, to infections that tend to become chronic. the likelihood of contracting chronic infections increases with age and pseudomonas aeruginosa becomes the dominant infecting microorganism, with a colonization percentage varying from  <dig> to 100%  <cit> .

recently, stenotrophomonas maltophilia has gained considerable attention as an important emerging nosocomial pathogen able to cause infections in debilitated and immunocompromised patients, as well as in cf patients  <cit> . colonization of the pulmonary tissues occurs in approximately one third of cf patients, nevertheless, there is controversy as whether s. maltophilia colonization leads to a poorer clinical outcome or morbidity  <cit> . persistent colonization by p. aeruginosa and the attendant damage of the epithelial mucosa by released pseudomonal exoproducts may increase the probability that s. maltophilia will colonize the respiratory tract of cf patients and significantly contribute to the progressive deterioration of their pulmonary functions  <cit> . however, the mechanism of pathogenicity enabling s. maltophilia to establish infection and chronic colonization of the respiratory tract of cf patients remains largely unexplored.

biofilm formation is increasingly recognized as an important bacterial virulence trait contributing to disease progression in cf and other diseases of the respiratory tract associated with chronic infections. biofilm growth is believed to protect bacteria from natural immune defenses, as well as from the actions of several antibiotic compounds  <cit> . p. aeruginosa strains isolated from the sputum of cf patients display morphologic and physiologic characteristics suggestive of in vivo biofilm formation, including over a 1000-fold increase in antibiotic resistance and a significant ability in evading host defense factors  <cit> .

s. maltophilia has been recently reported to be able to adhere to cultured epithelial respiratory cells, as well as to produce biofilm on a variety of abiotic surfaces  <cit> . in particular, s. maltophilia strains isolated from cf patients were shown to be able, although with striking differences, to adhere to and form biofilm on polystyrene  <cit> . since information on the ability of s. maltophilia to grow as biofilm in cf airway tissues is scarce, in the study described in this paper we evaluated, by quantitative assays and microscopic analysis , the ability of cf s. maltophilia strains to adhere, invade and form biofilm on cf-derived ib3- <dig> bronchial epithelial cell monolayers. moreover, the role of flagella in adhesiveness on ib3- <dig> epithelial cells was also evaluated by the construction of two independent s. maltophiia flii deletion mutants that were used to infect cultured monolayers. some of the results of the present study have been previously presented in the form of an abstract at the 18th european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases  <cit> .

RESULTS
s. maltophilia is able to adhere to and form biofilm on ib3- <dig> cell monolayers
we used ib3- <dig> human bronchial cf-derived cells to investigate the ability of s. maltophilia to adhere to and form biofilm. confluent ib3- <dig> cell monolayers were independently infected with the  <dig> cf-derived s. maltophilia strains chosen for this study ; both the adhesiveness and the ability to form biofilm were measured by determining the number  of bacteria  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection, respectively. growth curves, obtained with bacteria grown in mh broth, showed no significant differences in the mean generation time between isolates .

caption and abbreviations:aages shown are in years at the time of strain isolation. b chronic infection is defined as the presence of two or more positive cultures for s. maltophilia in a year. pa: p. aeruginosa; ca: c. albicans; sa: s. aureus; na, not available.

all s. maltophilia strains tested were able to adhere to ib3- <dig> cells after  <dig> hours of incubation, with significantly different levels of adhesiveness among the strains . s. maltophilia strains obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> showed the highest levels of adhesiveness , significantly higher if compared to that of the other strains .

with regard to biofilm formation, as judged by the number of cfu recovered after  <dig> hours of incubation, s. maltophilia strain obgtc <dig> produced the highest amount of biofilm  , a value significantly higher if compared to the other strains tested . no significant correlation was found between adhesiveness and the amount of biofilm formed .

clsm observation of ib3- <dig> cell monolayers infected for  <dig> or  <dig> hours with s. maltophilia showed no significant differences in cellular detachment with respect to control, thus confirming the integrity of exposed ib3- <dig> monolayers. furthermore, after  <dig> hours of infection, both sem and clsm analysis revealed clusters of s. maltophilia cells scattered across almost all ib3- <dig> cells . clsm analysis showed that microcolonies were embedded in extracellular matrix whose amount was significantly increased following infection . these morphological observations are strongly suggestive of s. maltophilia biofilm formation on ib3- <dig> cells.

flagella are involved in s. maltophilia adhesion to ib3- <dig> cell monolayers
s. maltophilia has been shown to produce flagella implicated in the ability of bacteria to adhere to polystyrene  <cit> . to assess the role of flagella on the ability of s. maltophilia to adhere to ib3- <dig> cell monolayers, the adhesiveness of flii mutant derivatives of s. maltophilia strains obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> was evaluated and compared to that of their parental wild-type strains by infecting ib3- <dig> cell monolayers, as described above. obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> were selected because they were the most adhesive in our group of strains . as reported in figure  <dig>  the loss of flagella significantly  decreased bacterial adhesiveness, if compared to that of their parental strains. we recovered  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu chamber- <dig> from ib3- <dig> cells infected with the obgtc <dig> flii mutant vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu chamber- <dig> of the parental strain, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu chamber- <dig> from cells infected with obgtc <dig> flii mutant vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu chamber- <dig> of the parental strain.

contrary to wt strains, exposure of ib3- <dig> cells to obgtc <dig> and - <dig> flii mutant strains for  <dig> hours disrupted cell monolayer. thus, results about biofilm formation by mutant strains are not available.

s. maltophilia is able to adhere to and form biofilm on polystyrene
we then tested the ability of our s. maltophilia strains to adhere to and form biofilm on polystyrene plates. all twelve strains were found to adhere to and form biofilm on polystyrene plates, although with striking differences among strains . considering adhesiveness, the od <dig> values  ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . in particular, adhesiveness of strain obgtc <dig>  was significantly higher than that of strains obgtc <dig>  obgtc <dig>  and obgtc <dig> . adhesiveness to polystyrene plates of the different strains did not correlate with their degree of adhesiveness to ib3- <dig> cells . with regard to biofilm formation, the od <dig> values ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . in particular, biofilm formed by strain obgtc <dig>  was significantly higher than that produced by strains obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> . again, the ability to form biofilm on polystyrene plates of the twelve strains was not significantly correlated to their ability to form biofilm on ib3- <dig> cell monolayers . on the other hand, the results of the crystal violet staining showed a statistically significant positive correlation  between adhesiveness and ability to form biofilm .

s. maltophilia internalizes within ib3- <dig> cells at low levels
to ascertain whether our strains of s. maltophilia are able to enter ib3- <dig> cells, bacterial internalization was evaluated by a classical antibiotic exclusion assay. due to high-level of gentamicin resistance, only  <dig> strains were tested for invasiveness. gentamicin was highly effective on inhibiting the growth of the s. maltophilia strains  and was proved to be not toxic for ib3- <dig> cells even when they were exposed up to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  as assessed by the xtt assay .

the results of the invasion experiments indicated that all strains tested were able to invade ib3- <dig> cells, albeit at a very low level. viable intracellular bacteria represented only a minor fraction of the total bacterial input used to infect cell monolayers.

internalization rates  were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> % for obgtc <dig>  obgtc <dig>  obgtc <dig>  obgtc <dig>  and obgtc <dig>  respectively. internalization levels  were not significantly related to adhesion levels  .

swimming and twitching motilities are not involved in s. maltophilia adhesion to and biofilm formation on ib3- <dig> cells
the motility of our twelve s. maltophilia clinical isolates was assessed by swimming and twitching assays, as described in materials and methods. s. maltophilia strains exhibited a very broad range of motility . ten out of  <dig>  strains showed swimming motility, ranging from  <dig> mm  to  <dig> mm . strains obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> did not exhibit swimming motility. all strains were able to move by twitching, ranging from  <dig> mm  to  <dig> mm . neither swimming nor twitching motility significantly correlated with adhesiveness to or biofilm formation on ib3- <dig> cells . as expected, both obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig> flii deletion mutants failed to show swimming motility .

pre-exposure to p. aeruginosa influences s. maltophilia adhesion to ib3- <dig> cell monolayers
it has previously been hypothesized that s. maltophilia colonization of pulmonary tissues of cf patients may be dependent on previous infections by strains of p. aeruginosa which, probably releasing not yet characterized exoproducts, induce damages of the pulmonary mucosa which may favor s. maltophilia colonization  <cit> . to get further insight on this phenomenon, we first infected ib3- <dig> cell monolayers with p. aeruginosa reference strain pao <dig> for  <dig> hours at 37°c , then rinsed three times with pbs, and finally incubated the cells with s. maltophilia strain obgtc <dig>  for further  <dig> hours. as control, we used monolayers separately infected with the two strains. the results obtained are summarized in figure  <dig>  when monolayers were separately infected,  <dig> hours-adhesiveness of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> to ib3- <dig> cells was significantly higher than that of s. maltophilia obgtc <dig> . however, when ib3- <dig> cell monolayers were first infected with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and then infected with obgtc <dig>  adhesiveness of s. maltophilia obgtc <dig> was significantly improved, if compared to that of monolayers infected with only strain obgtc <dig> . moreover, when monolayers were concomitantly infected with both strains the adhesiveness of s. maltophilia obgtc <dig> was significantly higher than that of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> , even higher than that showed when monolayers were infected with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> for  <dig> hours , thus suggesting that the presence of s. maltophilia obgtc <dig> negatively influences p. aeruginosa pao <dig> adhesiveness.

discussion
although recent clinical evidence highlights an increase in the frequency of isolation of s. maltophilia from respiratory tract of cf patients, the role of this microorganism in the pathophysiology of cf lung disease, as well as patient-to-patient spread, have not yet been clearly elucidated  <cit> . moreover, the correlation between s. maltophilia persistent lung colonization and reduced pulmonary function first reported by karpati et al  <cit> , has not yet been confirmed by further studies  <cit> . on the other hand, the increased isolation of s. maltophilia from the sputa of cf patients has become a cause of concern in the cf community, as the organism is highly resistant to many of the antibiotics prescribed in cf management  <cit> .

because of its increasing clinical relevance, its high level of antibiotic-resistance, and the paucity of information on its specific role in the pathogenesis of cf lung infections, new information regarding the interactions between s. maltophilia and cf airway tissues are of paramount importance. to our knowledge, this is the first study which evaluated the ability of cf-derived s. maltophilia clinical isolates to adhere to and form biofilm in experimental infection experiments using the cf-derived bronchial epithelial ib3-1cell line.

employing an in vitro static culture model, by using electron and confocal microscopy and determining the number  of attached bacteria at different time points post-infection, we showed that all the twelve studied cf-derived s. maltophilia isolates were able, although at different levels, to adhere and form biofilm when co-cultured with ib3- <dig> cell monolayers. such results suggest that these characteristics might be highly conserved among s. maltophilia strains isolated from cf patients. electron and confocal microscopy revealed s. maltophilia structures typical of biofilm formation on almost all bronchial ib3- <dig> cells. in particular, the overall cellular areas occupied by bacteria and their numbers are suggestive of the formation of microcolony, a finding reminiscent of the "flat" biofilm phenotype produced by p. aeruginosa, significantly different from the "mushroom-like" phenotype  <cit> . electron microscopy photographs revealed that s. maltophilia adhered to ib3- <dig> cells loses its cell profile, probably due to the presence of extracellular matrix. in fact, clsm examination showed microcolony embedded in extracellular matrix whose production was significantly increased following exposure to s. maltophilia.

the ability of s. maltophilia to form biofilm on ib3- <dig> cells may contribute to explain why s. maltophilia tends to produce persistent infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease despite intensive antibiotic treatment  <cit> . in this context, it is worth mentioning that some antibiotic-resistant s. maltophilia strains may persist in cf patients pulmonary tissue for up to  <dig> years, and that many patients are colonized at the same time with multiple strains of s. maltophilia  <cit> .

invasion of epithelial respiratory cells has been reported for cf-derived s. maltophilia clinical isolates  <cit> . we have recently reported that, with the exception of an environmental s. maltophilia isolate  all the cf-derived strains assayed were able to invade a <dig> cells  <cit> . in the present study we evaluated the ability of twelve s. maltophilia cf isolates to invade ib3- <dig> cells, by classical invasion assays. the results obtained clearly indicated, for the first time, that s. maltophilia cf isolates were able to invade ib3- <dig> cells, albeit at a very low level . since strains presented a significant degree of heterogeneity in internalization efficiencies, it might be possible to hypothesize that s. maltophilia entry within ib3- <dig> cells may be strain-dependent. together with the ability to form biofilm, the capability of s. maltophilia to enter ib3- <dig> might also explain the tendency of this microorganism to become persistent within cf pulmonary tissues, since within intracellular compartments it could find protection against host defenses and the reach of antibiotics. moreover, internalization may likely influence the modulation of the inflammatory response of the infected host.

it has been reported that flagella could act as adhesins which play a role in bacterial binding to host mucosal surfaces as well as to abiotic surfaces  <cit> . to study the role of flagella in the adhesiveness of s. maltophilia, we generated two independent mutants presenting a deletion encompassing the flii gene of s. maltophilia strains obgtc <dig> and obgtc <dig>  flii encodes a substrate-specific atpase , an enzyme necessary to provide energy for the export of flagellar structural components in a wide range of bacterial species  <cit> . swimming ability of the two mutant strains was almost completely abolished . when co-cultured with ib3- <dig> cell monolayers, the two mutants showed a reduced capacity to adhere to ib3- <dig> cells, if compared to that of parental wild type strains . further, we showed that neither swimming nor twitching motilities were significantly associated to adhesion to or biofilm formation on ib3- <dig> cells. thus, taken together, our results suggest that although flagella must play some role in s. maltophilia adhesiveness, regardless of their functionality, other structures must also be involved in this phenomenon, since the flii mutation only attenuates, but not abolishes, the ability of s. maltophilia strains to adhere to ib3- <dig> cells.

we were not able to assess the role of flagella in s. maltophilia biofilm formation since exposure of ib3- <dig> monolayers to flii- mutant strains caused their disruption already after 6h-exposure. further investigations are warranted to explain this apparent increased virulence following the loss of motility.

a number of methods have been developed for cultivation and quantification of biofilms  <cit> , but no standardized protocol for assessment of biofilm formation has been established so far. nevertheless, the microtiter plate method remains among the most frequently used assays for investigation of biofilm formation, and a number of modifications have been developed for the cultivation and quantification of bacterial biofilms  <cit> . since s. maltophilia biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces is generally considered less relevant than biofilm formation on cultured epithelial cells or in vivo, in this study we assayed biofilm formation onto an abiotic surface and compared the results to the ability of our s. maltophilia strains to form biofilm on ib3- <dig> cells, as assessed by quantitative colony counts. in agreement with previously reported experiments  <cit> , all the twelve s. maltophilia clinical isolates tested were able to form biofilm on both polystyrene and ib3- <dig> cultured epithelial cells. however, no correlation was found between quantitative biofilm formation on the abiotic surface and qualitative biofilm formation on cultured cell monolayers, thus suggesting that the microtiter plate assay may not be predictive of the ability of s. maltophilia to form biofilm in vivo. several explanations may account for this discrepancy. the crystal violet assay is surely a less specific method, and it is likely that the dye might also stain negatively charged extracellular molecules, including cell surface molecules and polysaccharides present in the extracellular matrix in mature biofilms, thus influencing the outcome of the test. further studies are certainly needed to clarify this point.

recent studies from different laboratories have highlighted the importance of interspecies bacterial interactions in influencing bacterial virulence and response to antibiotic therapy, both in pulmonary infections of cf and non-cf patients  <cit> . in cf patients, there are several lines of evidence indicating the presence of a mosaic of diverse bacteria so that infections of cf pulmonary tissues are usually considered always polymicrobial  <cit> . recently, ryan et al.  <cit>  have reported that the presence of s. maltophilia significantly influences, as through the synthesis of a diffusible signal factor, the architecture of p. aeruginosa biofilm formation and augments its susceptibility to polymyxins, recently re-introduced into clinical practice as anti-pseudomonal agents.

in general, s. maltophilia is very often co-isolated with p. aeruginosa from cf patients  <cit>  and it has been hypothesized that infection by p. aeruginosa may enhance the chance of s. maltophilia to colonize cf pulmonary tissues  <cit> . if this is true, it is reasonable to hypothesize that p. aeruginosa might enhance the ability of s. maltophilia to adhere to and/or invade cf pulmonary tissues. in order to analyze this possibility we first infected ib3- <dig> cell monolayers with reference p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain, and then with s. maltophilia strain obgtc <dig> . the results obtained showed that while p. aeruginosa pao <dig> binds more efficiently to cell monolayers than does s. maltophilia obgtc <dig>  a previous exposition of ib3- <dig> cell monolayers to p. aeruginosa pao <dig> significantly improves s. maltophilia adhesiveness; therefore, it suggests a synergistic relationship between these pathogens similarly to what reported by saiman et al.  <cit>  who found a synergistic relationship between p. aeruginosa and p. cepacia. demonstrating this, most  of s. maltophilia-positive cf patients considered in the present study was found to have been infected in the past with p. aeruginosa .

CONCLUSIONS
although the pathogenic role of s. maltophilia in cf lung disease is unclear and subject to controversy, the results of the present study suggest that this microorganism should not be considered just a bystander in cf patients. in this respect, we have shown that : i) s. maltophilia is able to adhere to and invade cf-derived ib3- <dig> cultured bronchial epithelial cells; ii) the ability of s. maltophilia strains to form biofilm and to invade epithelial cells might account for the persistence and the systemic spread of this opportunistic pathogen in cf patients; iii) a previous infection by p. aeruginosa may have an impact on s. maltophilia colonization of cf pulmonary tissues.

further experiments using in vivo models which more closely mimic cf pulmonary tissues are certainly needed to validate the relevance of our results. furthermore, our model may be useful to study the different stages of the intricate relationships between s. maltophilia and the cf airway epithelium, if compared to the abiotic model method. this may help in the development of new strategies for preventive and/or therapeutic intervention against the factors that trigger cf airways colonization by s. maltophilia.
