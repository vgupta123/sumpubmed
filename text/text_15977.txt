BACKGROUND
alternative splicing in the brain has gained significant attention recently and may be important for a vast number of processes  <cit>  such as synaptic function  <cit>  and learning and memory  <cit> . examples of alternatively spliced genes include the d <dig> receptor gene  <cit> , the corticotropin releasing hormone  receptor genes  <cit>  and the cannabinoid receptor genes  <cit> . a limitation to the study of the roles of the various splice variants in brain function is that very often specific ligands or inhibitors are lacking. furthermore, transgenic approaches may be both costly and time consuming, and/or depend on viral delivery which may induce immune responses  <cit> .

single stranded dna or rna antisense oligonucleotides  that target rna transcripts can be used to manipulate gene expression in different manners. dna:rna or rna:rna hybrids can be cleaved by rnase h resulting in knockdown of gene expression. a similar effect can be achieved via steric hindrance of the ribosomal complex by an aon resulting in mrna translation arrest and blocking of protein expression  <cit> . a third mechanism involves the hybridization of an aon to intronic/exonic inclusion sequences of primary rna transcripts, thus rendering specific exons inaccessible to the splicing machinery and leading to skipping of the exon  <cit> . in a similar fashion, aons can hybridize to intronic/exonic exon exclusion sequences and result in inclusion of target exons  <cit> .

to date, modulation of splicing by aons has been used as a potential treatment approach for several diseases, including duchenne muscular dystrophy  and models of spinal muscular atrophy   <cit> . effective protein restoration in dmd via exon skipping has been shown in patient derived cell cultures, animal models,  is their inability to cross the blood-brain-barrier of adult animals  <cit> . nevertheless, when aons are applied directly to the cns via intracerebroventricular  or intrathecal administration, the results show considerable potential  <cit>  and long-lasting effects  <cit> . in this study we evaluated the efficacy and occurrence of immune-related side effects after a single local aon injection in the central amygdala of the mouse brain. as proof of principle, we targeted steroid receptor coactivator- <dig> , a gene that codes for two splice variants, src-1a and src-1e, which only differ in one exon . src- <dig> can act as a coregulator of glucocorticoid receptor  dependent transcription  <cit> , as well as of other nuclear receptors  <cit> . the src- <dig> splice variants show differential activity and distribution in the brain  <cit> . the splice variants have been shown to exert opposite effects on the gr-mediated regulation of the crh gene  <cit> .

we targeted exon  <dig> of the src- <dig> gene  using aons, examined their cellular uptake by different cell types, exon skipping efficacy over time and potential immunostimulatory effects. for cellular uptake and potential immunostimulatory effects we used an aon targeting human dystrophin that has no known targets in the murine genome, in order to investigate the target-independent physico-chemical properties of 2-o’-methyl modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. our results showed adequate uptake by cells in the cea and translocation into the cell nucleus, combined with detectable isoform switching until at least  <dig> days after a single injection and a practically complete lack of immunostimulatory effects compared with vehicle injection.

RESULTS
cellular uptake
in order to investigate the cell types and intracellular destination of 2-o’-methyl phosphorothioate aons we performed immunofluorescent detection of crh , neun and hoechst after local injection of an aon targeting human dystrophin, which has no known targets in the mouse. our results showed that fluorescently labeled aons were taken up by neurons in general, as well as neurons expressing crh in the cea, and also translocated into the cell nucleus . quantification showed that  <dig> % ±  <dig>  of the cells that had taken up the aons was neun positive. this indicates that the aons can indeed be taken up by neurons in the brain and translocate to the nucleus where splicing events take place.

aon detection
in order to determine the stability of aons in the brain after local injection we measured the intensity of the green fluorescence originating from the fluorophore conjugated to aons in the brains of animals sacrificed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after a single injection with an aon targeting human dystrophin. fluorescence intensity did not differ significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> days but subsequently decreased over time to less than 50% in  <dig> days . after  <dig> days, fluorescence intensity remained stable until the last detection time point,  <dig> days post-injection. in these calculations only green signal colocalized with hoechst  was taken into account, thus restricting our analysis to a functionally relevant subcellular compartment.

diffusion of aons
in order to investigate the specific targeting of a selected brain region we measured the diffusion of the aons around the injection site. our results indicated a well localized targeting of about  <dig>  mm <dig> .

lengths in μm, volumes in mm <dig>  data shown as mean ± sem.

immunostimulatory effects
we analyzed two different markers for microglia activation  and one marker for astrocytes . cd- <dig> is a marker of activated microglia, whereas iba- <dig> is a constitutive marker of microglia  <cit> . we compared aon-injected  to saline-injected animals  <dig> and  <dig> days after the injections. moreover, we included an untreated group of animals to assess the effects of the injections. no differences were observed between saline and aon treated animals at either time point . aon uptake was also observed in a subset of gfap positive astrocytes . little or no uptake by microglia was observed.

isoform switching
in order to determine the efficacy of aons treatment on exon skipping in the brain we used qpcr analysis to measure the expression ratio of the two isoforms in the cea,  <dig> and  <dig> days after a single injection with either an aon against src-1e or a control-aon. three days after the injection the src-1a:src-1e ratio showed a 2-fold shift in favor of src-1a in the group injected with aons against src-1e, in comparison to the control-aon injected group. however, total src- <dig> expression was not different between the groups . seven days after injection the expression ratio was still significantly higher in the animals injected with aons against src-1e  without a difference in total src- <dig> expression. as an additional control for specificity, mrna for gr  was not significantly different between the groups either at the 3- or the 7-days time point. in view of previously reported upregulation of src- <dig> in src- <dig> knockout mice  <cit> , we determined src- <dig> mrna. we did not find a significant difference between the two groups regarding src- <dig> expression  <dig> days post injection. src- <dig> expression was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for animals injected with aons targeting src-1e and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for animals injected with human dystrophin = <dig> , p> <dig> ).

discussion
in this study, we investigated the efficacy in aon-mediated isoform switching, aon uptake by different cellular types and the putative immunostimulatory effects of aons, in order to evaluate their potential use as a tool in experimental brain research.

our results showed that it is possible to alter the expression ratio of the two src- <dig> isoforms with a single injection of aons targeting exon  <dig> of the transcript of src-1e. three days after the injection the isoform expression ratio showed a 2-fold increase in favor of src-1a, whereas  <dig> days after a single injection of aons the respective difference was approximately  <dig> -fold in favor of src-1a. in order to confirm that this was a genuine effect and was not influenced by downregulation of total src- <dig> we also investigated total src- <dig> expression in the two groups, which was shown to be comparable and not significantly different at both time points. we also investigated the expression of gr to control for possible differences as a consequence of off-target non-homologous binding of the aons. we selected gr as an additional control, because src- <dig> is involved in gr-dependent pathways. our results showed that gr mrna expression is not significantly different between animals injected with either an aon targeting src-1e or a control aon  <dig> or  <dig> days after a single injection. this finding indicates no difference in non-homologous targeting between the specifically targeted and the control aons and is also relevant for future experiments attempting to unravel the role of src- <dig> and its isoforms in gr dependent pathways as any effects can be attributed solely to src- <dig> isoform switching. since src- <dig> has been shown to be upregulated in the absence of src- <dig> during development  <cit> , we investigated its expression  <dig> days after injection in order to rule out an effect of src- <dig> isoform switching on src- <dig> expression. we did not find src- <dig> upregulation, which is in line with the absence of effects on total src- <dig>  although a larger-scale transcriptome and/or proteome analysis would be necessary to investigate all potential off-target effects of the aons used in this study  <cit> , our results from total src- <dig>  src- <dig> and gr mrna expression indicate high specificity. in addition, since aons do not obligatorily interfere with endogenous pathways, unlike sirnas, they cannot saturate the cellular mirna machinery  <cit> , thus avoiding a source of off-target effects.

regarding the effect size of the aons’ efficacy, it is important to note that the dissected area, particularly at longer distances from the injection site may contain cells that did not take up aons. for the group treated with aons against src-1e that would mean a dilution of the effect. therefore, the actual efficacy of exon skipping could well be higher than observed.

the detection of isoform switching  <dig> days after a single injection of aons allows animals sufficient time for post-operational recovery and performance of additional experiments, for instance, behavioral experiments. in addition, we were able to detect fluorescence of aons up to  <dig> days after injection, which is probably accompanied by isoform switching to some extent, although the decrease of the expression ratio of the two isoforms between  <dig> and  <dig> days indicates that the effect size may decrease over time. if longer lasting effects are required, potential solutions may involve higher doses and repeated or continuous administration  <cit> . persisting effects have been shown even  <dig> months after termination of continuous infusion of aons for  <dig> days in the ventricles of the brain  <cit> , and even single administration may have long-lasting effects  <cit> .

astrocytosis and microglia activation may confound any findings in relation to brain function. we found no differences in the immune responses caused by a single injection of aons or a single injection of sterile saline  <dig> or  <dig> days after the injections. the time course of astrocytosis and microgliosis that we observed both in vehicle and aon treated animals was similar to what has been previously reported for saline injections  <cit> . it is unlikely we have reached a plateau in immune responses with saline, since it has been shown in the past that administration of lipopolysaccharide causes substantially stronger immune responses than saline  <cit> . immunostimulatory effects that have been observed in other studies may have been caused by the vehicle used  <cit> , or immune responses elicited by simulation of toll-like receptors  through the phosphorothioate backbone of the aons  <cit> . however, 2-o’-modifications may act as tlr antagonists  <cit> , which may account for the lack of immune responses in our study , as well as in others  <cit> . hua et al.,  <dig> reported an upregulation of iba- <dig> mrna expression after continuous infusion for  <dig> days of 2-o’-methyl modified aons but not of 2-o’-methoxyethyl aons compared to saline. this discrepancy between the current study and the study of hua et al. may be due to the different experimental setup. the current study used a local single injection of ~ <dig> μg of aons instead of a continuous icv administration of  <dig> μg or more per day for  <dig> days that induced significant upregulation of iba- <dig> in the spinal cord, or  <dig> μg or more that was necessary to induce significant upregulation of iba- <dig> in the brain. administration of  <dig> μg of aons per day was not enough to cause significant iba- <dig> upregulation in the brain. although it is difficult to compare final local concentrations of the two approaches, our results show that we probably remain well within the “safe” range regarding the induction of immune responses. nevertheless, this indicates that side effects of aon treatment may also depend on design, dose, frequency or delivery of treatment and one should be aware of potential risks  <cit> .

before aons can exert their effect, it is crucial that they cross the cell membrane and the nuclear membrane, since splicing takes place in the nucleus  <cit> . how aons are taken up and how they are transported to the nucleus is not known. it has been shown in models of dmd that because of the lack of dystrophin protein, affected muscle cells can more easily take up aons due to the altered properties of their muscle fiber membranes and a more open endothelium  <cit> . however, mechanisms of aon uptake by intact neurons in the cns are probably different and may involve utilization of trafficking pathways for cellular uptake of aons including absorptive endocytosis, pinocytosis and clathrin-, caveolin-, actin-, dynamin- dependent and -independent pathways  <cit> . moreover, aon cellular uptake may exploit the natural pathways of cell-to-cell nucleic acid transportation that may be also involved in micro-rna transportation  <cit> . it is very likely that different physical and chemical properties of aons depending on their chemistry, 2-o’-modifications and length may also be determining factors for the manner and efficiency of uptake  <cit> . the aon chemistry used in the current study has been shown to be advantageous for nuclear uptake  <cit> .

we also showed that cells of interest in the cea can take up aons; neun and crh positive cells represent neurons and cells expressing crh, a hormone crucial for fear conditioning and orchestration of stress responses in the brain  <cit> , and a putative target of src- <dig> mediated regulation  <cit> . neun positive cells account for the majority of cells taking up aons. moreover, we observed sporadic aon uptake by astrocytes and little or no by microglia. the low uptake by microglia cells may be due to either the properties of those cells, or the fact that they seem to arrive at the injection site probably after aons have been already taken up by other cells. the fraction of aon-positive astrocytes was substantially lower than for neun-positive cells. other studies suggested that in primates aon uptake by astrocytes may be more substantial  <cit> . on the other hand, gfap staining visualizes only part of the total population of astrocytes  <cit>  since some astrocytes do not express gfap  <cit> . hence, it is possible that gfap negative astrocytes may have taken up aons. to summarize, based on our findings we can conclude that generally neurons in the brain take up aons, without, however, being able to rule out the possibility that different populations of neurons may display uptake at different rates, efficiencies or even complete lack of aon uptake. in the injected areas in the cea, though, the vast majority of neun positive cells take up aons.

it is important to mention that we did not detect the aons directly, but rather the fluorophore with which they were labeled. since this can be cleaved off, it would be possible that we detected fluorophores that were not bound to the aons. however, that is not likely since uptake takes place very rapidly after injections, when little or no degradation of the aon-fluorophore complex is expected. moreover, the considerable effect on exon skipping  <dig> and  <dig> days after an injection indicates aon activity which coincides with detection of fluorescence in the cells. for this study we made the assumption of equal stability between the two aons.

although the addition of a fluorophore increases hydrophobicity, hence cellular trafficking, it also increases its size. therefore, the diffusion we observe here might be an over- or an underestimation of what it would be without the fluorophore attached. importantly, efficacy has been shown to be similar between labeled and unlabeled aons  <cit> . finally, our measurements of the diffusion of the aons indicate that a specific brain region can be targeted with minimal leakage to adjacent areas. the diffusion observed here is likely a function of the targeted area, the volume and aon concentration and the injection rate and it may not be possible to directly extrapolate to other situations. nevertheless, one would assume that with an optimal combination of volume and concentration smaller regions may also be targeted with reasonable specificity.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have shown that it is possible to induce specific exon skipping and subsequent isoform switching of src- <dig> in the cea without noticeable adverse effects. our future work will address the functional consequences of src- <dig> isoform switching, as well as the many additional genes that are potential targets of such. this use of isoform switching with aons has great potential that it must be considered not only in cases where it can restore aberrant gene expression and function, but also as an important molecular tool for manipulation of gene expression that constitutes an alternative to rna interference or knock-out models.
