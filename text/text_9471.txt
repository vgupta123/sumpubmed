BACKGROUND
heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans  that decorate proteoglycan core proteins vary in chain length, net charge, and charge distribution, making them quite heterogenous. this is due, in large part, to post-translational addition, then removal, of sulfate groups to various positions on the constituent monosaccharides, orchestrated by a battery of enzymes in a tissue- or cell-specific manner  <cit> . this level of complexity and potential regulation afforded by the proteoglycan system can, therefore, be considered relatively high.

the gag heparan sulfate has an important role in regulating cell function by serving as a co-factor, or co-receptor, in growth-factor  interactions. indeed, without available heparan sulfate proteoglycans , growth factor activity would be limited; during development, heparan sulfate  deficiency is lethal  <cit>  while targeted disruption of normal hs post translational modification results in a structurally altered hs and lethality, with kidney, lung, and skeletal defects  <cit> .

the most highly studied and well-understood of the interactions between hspgs and gfs is that between heparan sulfate and fibroblast growth factors  <dig> and  <dig> , two closely related members of a large fgf family  <cit> . fgfs are mitogenic for a variety of cell types, promoting differentiation and wound healing  <cit> . the crystal structure of the ligand/receptor complex for fgf- <dig> and the fgf receptor  has been determined, clarifying the importance of heparin  as a co-receptor in dimerization of the growth factors and their receptors leading to activation  <cit> .

native perlecan  is an extracellular matrix proteoglycan with three hs side chains linked to a large core protein of approximately  <dig> kda in  <dig> recognizable domains which, themselves, are comprised of subdomains  <cit> . domain  <dig> of perlecan  comprises only a small fraction of the native perlecan encoding an approximately  <dig> kda protein core with the primary sequence potential for three o-linked gag chains. while the c-terminus of pln.d <dig> is known to have sequence homology with an sea module that is also found in a related hspg, agrin, and in regions of other biomolecules receiving extensive o-linked glycosylation  <cit> , the tertiary structure of pln.d <dig> is not known.

the hs of pln.d <dig> is reported to promote cell adhesion  <cit> , to promote proliferation and/or differentiation  <cit> , and to bind and deliver growth factors  <cit> . independently, there is strong scientific support and rationale for a role of perlecan in angiogenesis or neovascularization  <cit> . interference between fgf or vegf and perlecan hs binding has been shown to diminish the functional activity of these gf's  <cit> .

numerous growth factors are being tested as therapeutic agents  <cit>  and some are currently commercially available. it is reasonable, therefore, that increased levels of soluble hs proteoglycan delivered concomitantly with certain growth factors would lead to enhanced growth factor activity in a physiological manner and be of value in wound management and healing.

while recombinant mouse  <cit>  and human  <cit>  perlecan d <dig> have been partially characterized, here we provide characterization of two human pln.d <dig> recombinants generated from adenovirus or plasmid dna expression.

methods
construction of pln.d <dig> transgene
perlecan d <dig>  was cloned by reverse-transcriptase extension of total human endothelial cell rna using perlecan specific primers, then amplified by pcr and cloned into pcdna  <dig> +  incorporating amino acids 1- <dig> or 1- <dig> . in each clone a kozac-like sequence  was strengthened by inserting cca immediately 5' to the native ccatg at - <dig> relative to the start codon . the native secretory leader sequence was not modified. a 6×-his tag was added to the c-terminus of each clone for identification. sequence identity of the full-length domain  <dig> clone compared to the hspg <dig>  was confirmed. dna stocks were prepared with qiagen endonuclease free maxiprep kits.

construction of pln.d <dig> adenovirus
pln. <dig> or pln. <dig> transgenes were subsequently cloned into an adenoviral expression construct with a cmv- <dig> promoter . adenovirus with a pln.d <dig> transgene  were isolated using a virakit adenomini- <dig> system .

synthesis of rhpln.d1
hek  <dig> cells were grown on  <dig> mm culture dishes in dulbecco's modified eagles medium  with  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  ph  <dig> , and supplemented with 10%  fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig>  mg/ml streptomycin  at 37°c with 5% co <dig> in a humidified incubation chamber. hek  <dig> cells were cultured to 90% confluence then transfected with lipoplexes containing pln.198-pcdna <dig> + or pln.247-pcdna <dig> + and lipofectamine <dig>  in 1: <dig>  or 1: <dig> μg dna: μg lf2k standard ratio and following the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of serum. cells were incubated for  <dig> days following transfection and conditioned media containing secreted protein was collected.

alternatively, hek  <dig> cells cultured to 90% confluency were infected with pln.198-ad or pln.247-ad at tcid <dig>  <dig> × 107/ml and incubated for  <dig> days to express protein.

conditioned media containing secreted protein synthesized by either method was collected and separated from cellular debris by centrifugation for  <dig> min at 5k rpm and 4°c and then filtered through a  <dig>  μm filter prior to anionic exchange chromatography.

purification of high mr rhpln.d1
filtered media was diluted 10× into binding buffer  and bound to a hitrap anion exchange column  connected to an aktaprime fplc at  <dig> ml/min. the column was washed to a flat baseline, without tween- <dig>  and bound contaminants were removed by a continual wash with 10% elution buffer  until a flat baseline was reached. remaining bound rhpln.d <dig> was eluted from the column with a  <dig> ml gradient to 100% elution buffer at  <dig>  ml/min collecting  <dig> ml fractions and monitoring absorbance at  <dig> nm.

analyzing the fractions by techniques described below, fractions containing the high molecular weight , glycosylated protein were pooled and the buffer was exchanged to  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig>  by repeated dilution and concentration using  <dig> ml centricones  with  <dig> kda mwco. after anionic exchange chromatography and pooling of heterogeneous fractions, enriched high mr rhpln. <dig> from  <dig> ml conditioned medium generated by adenovirus yielded  <dig> ml of  <dig> μg/ml protein as determined by abs <dig> using a calculated extinction coefficient of  <dig> m-1cm- <dig> for the recombinant. enriched high mr rhpln. <dig> from  <dig> ml conditioned medium yielded  <dig> ml of  <dig> ug/ml as determined by abs <dig> and a calculated extinction coefficient of  <dig> m- <dig> cm- <dig>  plasmid transfection generated approximately  <dig> fold less recombinant than adenoviral infection, per volume conditioned media. for storage, 1% glycerol was added to the protein stock and protein was stored at -20°c.

western blot
proteins were separated on a 12% sds-page gel at  <dig> v and transferred to nitrocellulose utilizing a biorad mini transblot system at  <dig>  amp for  <dig> mins. the blot was blocked in  <dig>  mm kcl,  <dig>  mm kh2po <dig>   <dig> mm nacl, and  <dig>  mm na2hpo <dig>  containing  <dig> mm sodium azide and  <dig> % tween  <dig>  for  <dig> min at room temperature and with agitation. the blot was then incubated in primary antibody csi 001- <dig>  overnight at 4°c with rocking, washed in pbs-tween, and incubated in goat-anti-mouse ap conjugated secondary antibody  for  <dig> hr at 4°c with rocking. after washing, the blot was developed with sigmafast bcip/nbt tablets dissolved in ddh2o and imaged on a kodak gellogic  <dig> imaging system.

stains-all/silver
acidic and/or glycosylated pln.d <dig> was visualized by sds-page and stains-all staining enhanced by silver nitrate similar to the protocols of goldberg and warner  <cit> . proteins were separated on a 12% sds-page gel, and the gel was washed for  <dig> mins in  <dig> ml of 25% isopropanol with  <dig> solution changes to remove the sds. the gel was then incubated in  <dig> ml of stains-all staining solution  overnight in a light-tight box at room temperature with agitation. the stain was removed, and the gel was destained in  <dig> ml of 25% isopropanol maintaining light tightness until the background was a light pink and protein bands could be discerned. the gel was imaged on a kodak gellogic  <dig> with transmitted white light for  <dig>  ms exposure with an f-stop of  <dig> . after imaging, the gel was allowed to fade by light in 25% isopropanol intermittently exchanged with ddh2o to a clear background. the gel was then washed thrice with ddh2o and incubated in  <dig> ml of freshly prepared  <dig> mm agno <dig> for  <dig> mins, rinsed three times in ddh2o, and developed with  <dig> ml of  <dig>  m na2hco <dig>   <dig> % formaldehyde after rinsing the gel twice quickly with approximately  <dig> ml of the same solution. the development reaction was stopped with 10% acetic acid. the gel was again imaged using the gellogic  <dig> 

elisa
enzyme linked immunosorbant assays  were performed in polystyrene microtiter wells. proteins were coated overnight at 4°c onto the surfaces in pbs and  <dig> mm sodium azide . all wells were then blocked and washed in pbs-tween. primary murine antibodies were applied in pbs-tween at a concentration of  <dig>  μg/ml overnight at 4°c. secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase  were applied at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> h then ap activity was monitored at  <dig> nm by hydrolysis of the substrate 4-nitrophenylphosphate  in  <dig> mm tris, ph  <dig>  with  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> using a bio-tek instruments, inc. μquant spectrophotometer . apparent dissociation constants  were derived by solid-phase with elisa as previously described  <cit>  and presented with standard deviation.

mass spectrometry analysis
maldi-tof mass spectrometry was performed after tryptic digestion of rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> purified protein. enzymatic digestion with trypsin   was carried out for sixteen hours at 37°c. peptide solutions were then extracted using two washes of  <dig> μl of a 50/ <dig> solution of 5% formic acid and acetonitrile for thirty minutes. supernatants were collected and dried down in a savant speedvac. samples were resuspended in  <dig> μl of  <dig> % formic acid. c <dig> ziptips  were used to desalt peptide mixtures before analysis. an aliquot  of each digest was loaded onto a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> μm i.d. c <dig> reverse-phase cartridge at  <dig> μl/min. after washing the cartridge for  <dig> min with  <dig> % formic acid in ddh <dig>  the bound peptides were flushed onto a  <dig> cm ×  <dig> μm i.d. c <dig> reverse-phase analytical column with a  <dig> min linear 5-50% acetonitrile gradient in  <dig> % formic acid at  <dig> nl/min. the column was washed with 90% acetonitrile- <dig> % formic acid for  <dig> min and then re-equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile- <dig> % formic acid for  <dig> min. the eluted peptides were passed directly from the tip into a modified microionspray interface of an applied biosystems-mds-sciex   <dig> qtrap mass spectrometer. eluted peptides were subjected to a survey ms scan to determine the top three most intense ions. a second scan  determined the charge state of the selected ions. finally, enhanced product ion scans were carried out to obtain the tandem mass spectrum of the selected parent ions  over the range from m/z 400- <dig>  spectra were centroided and de-isotoped by analyst software, version  <dig>  . these tandem mass spectrometry data were processed to provide protein identifications using an in-house mascot search engine  against the ncbinr human protein database.

circular dichroism of rhpln.d1
cd was performed on  <dig>  μm rhpln. <dig> or  <dig>  μm rhpln. <dig> in  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig>  using a jasco j- <dig> spectrometer at 20°c,  <dig>  mm pathlength cell,  <dig> accumulations,  <dig> nm steps, and from  <dig> to  <dig> nm. buffer was the baseline and was subtracted from the protein spectrum. all spectra were computationally smoothed and filtered  with the jasco spectra analysis software. estimations of helix and strand content were calculated with raussens method http://perry.freeshell.org/raussens.html.

growth factor ligand blot
rhpln.d <dig> samples were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for  <dig>  hr at  <dig>  amp. after blocking, blots were incubated in  <dig>  μg/ml rhfgf- <dig>  in pbs-tween overnight at 4°c with rocking. blots were washed in pbs-tween and incubated in  <dig> μg/ml anti-fgf-biotin antibody  for  <dig> hr at 4°c with rocking, then washed in pbs-tween, and incubated in  <dig> μg/ml streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase  for  <dig> hr at 4°c with rocking. blots were then developed and imaged as described in the section western blots above.

glycosidase digestion
enriched pln.d <dig> was digested with heparinase i, ii , and iii  and with chondroitinase abc  overnight at 37°c with  <dig> mu of enzyme/μg pln.d <dig> in  <dig> mm hepes,  <dig> mm nacl, ph  <dig> . controls of undigested protein were also incubated in the same manner. digested samples were examined by mab 001- <dig> western blot and stains-all/silver sds-page applying  <dig>  μg protein/lane.

ligand binding elisa
the ligand binding assay was a variant of the elisa in which dilutions of ligand  were allowed to bind to a ligand binding protein such as rhpln.d <dig> that had been coated onto the wells in pbs-n <dig>  the bound ligand was then detected with biotin-conjugated mab specific for hfgf- <dig> which was followed by a streptavidin-ap conjugate and developed as described for elisa. apparent kd were derived as previously described  <cit>  in these assays using serial dilutions of ligand with even amounts of coated ligand binding protein. results are accompanied by standard deviation.

growth factor dot blots
growth factors rhfgf- <dig>  rhvegf <dig>  rhvegf <dig>  rhpdgf-bb, rhegf, rhigf, rhfgf- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  and rhbmp- <dig> were bound to nitrocellulose at  <dig> ng utilizing a biorad dot blot apparatus. blots were blocked in pbs-tween and incubated in  <dig> μg/ml rhpln. <dig> or rhpln. <dig>  in pbs-tween overnight at 4°c with rocking. alternatively, some blots were incubated in heparinise iii digested rhpln. <dig>  overnight at 4°c with rocking. after washing, blots were incubated in  <dig> ug/ml rhpln.d <dig> primary antibody csi 001- <dig> in pbs-tween overnight at 4°c with rocking. blots were then washed and incubated in  <dig> ug/ml goat-anti-mouse ap conjugated secondary antibody for  <dig> hr at 4°c with rocking. blots were then developed and imaged as described.

baf <dig> proliferation assays
proliferation of fgfr1c-expressing baf <dig> cells were monitored via mts reagent and absorbance at  <dig> nm with the addition of  <dig>  nm rhfgf- <dig> and titration of rhpln. <dig>  baf <dig> cells were maintained in rpmi  <dig> medium containing 10% v/v fbs, 10% v/v wehi-3bd conditioned medium and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. for the mitogenic assays, the baf <dig> cells were transferred into il- <dig> depleted medium in low serum for  <dig> h prior to experimentation and seeded into 96-well plates at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well in the presence of fgf- <dig> , heparin  and either hcaec perlecan  or rhpln. <dig> . cells were incubated for  <dig> h in 5% co <dig> at 37°c and the amount of cells present was assessed using the mts reagent  by adding to the cell cultures for  <dig> h prior to measuring the absorbance at  <dig> nm.

huvec proliferation assays
huvec were purchased from lifeline cell technologies, inc. and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions with lct vasculife engs medium including all supplied lifefactors . for proliferation studies, low passage number cells  were seeded in  <dig> well plates directly into experimental medium at  <dig> cells/well in  <dig> μl assay medium, lct vasculife engs containing only selected lifefactors . experimental conditions included  <dig> ng/ml of growth factor  in assay medium with dilutions of enriched rhpln. <dig> or rhpln. <dig>  cell count was measured after  <dig> hr incubation by conversion of dojindo's cck <dig> dye with  <dig> hr incubation on live cells. resulting absorbance of the converted substrate was measured at  <dig> nm in a parallel microtiter plate. measurements were adjusted for background with measurements taken from control media.

RESULTS
anion exchange chromatographic separation of rhpln.d <dig> by gag level
hek  <dig> cells were infected with the pln.247-ad or the pln.198-ad and the conditioned medium was subjected to anion exchange chromatography with a linear nacl gradient to  <dig> m . testing the hypothesis that retention on the anionic exchange column through increasing ionic strength of the elution buffer would be characterized by an immunopositive rhpln.d <dig> with increasing gag chain length, we sampled a broad range of immunopositive fractions by western blot using the anti-pln.d <dig> mab csi 001- <dig> . in the eluant, we found that the immunoreactive species with the lower net apparent kda  eluted earliest  and that increasing salt eluted rhpln.d <dig> species with increasing gag length and greater apparent kda. the early fractions of each recombinant were characterized by highly immunoreactive, minimally glycosylated species, the lowest approximately where the unglycosylated core of pln. <dig>  and pln. <dig>  was expected to migrate. beyond  <dig> ml, eluting from approximately  <dig>  m nacl, these lower mr species were absent while a broad range of immunoreactivity spanning 30- <dig> kda upward  or 50- <dig>  eluted, gradually increasing in apparent mr through  <dig> ml . the range of apparent kda in these higher mr fractions suggested a recombinant species with gag chains totalling  <dig> kda to > <dig> kda in rhpln. <dig>  or average individual chain sizes of 8- <dig> kda, assuming glycosylation of the  <dig> sgd linkage sites within rhpln. <dig>  the higher mr fractions of pln. <dig> did not appear to be glycosylated as extensively, with estimated gag chains of 3- <dig> kda again assuming glycosylation at each of the three sgd regions in rhpln. <dig>  the synthesis of rhpln. <dig> in huvec culture resulted in matching data . similar data were also produced when the hek  <dig> cells were transfected instead with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding the pln. <dig> transgene .

while it appeared by immunoblot with mab 001- <dig> that the overwhelming majority of both rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> were poorly glycosylated, the use of protein staining in companion stains-all gels  or silver stain  demonstrated that the more extensively glycosylated species constituted the majority of recombinant in the eluant, suggesting that the csi 001- <dig> mab had been more reactive with rhpln.d <dig> species having undeveloped or shortened gag chains.

native pln not detected in high mr rhpln.d <dig> preparation
to support the hypothesis that the csi-001- <dig> immunoreactive species eluting in relatively high salt were recombinant and not native pln.d <dig>  we pooled the fractions from 34- <dig> ml containing only high mr rhpln.d <dig>  reduced the salt by buffer exchange, then aliquots were immobilized in microtiter wells and elisa performed with a panel of anti-perlecan antibodies . these data indicated that the perlecan core was recognized only by the anti-d <dig> core antibody csi 001- <dig> but not by the anti-d <dig> antibody 7b <dig>  nor the anti-d <dig> antibody a7l <dig>  nor the anti-d <dig> antibody csi 001- <dig>  the recombinant pools were each found to have cs glycosylation recognized by mab cs <dig>  while mab 10e <dig> recognized the predominately unsulfated hs epitopes  <cit> . interestingly, mab csi 001- <dig> , that is known to recognize domain  <dig> of native perlecan , poorly recognized the truncated recombinants rhpln. <dig>  and rhpln. <dig>  relative to mab csi 001- <dig> .

mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-digested purified rhpln. <dig> resulted in the identification of several pln.d <dig> fragments  but no other perlecan domains were detected. however, analysis of western blots with gels developed with silver or stains-all suggested that the higher mr fractions selected for pooling and analysis had minor levels of contaminating proteins . by mass spectrometry of enriched rhpln. <dig> or rhpln. <dig>  only three other minor protein contaminants were identified, presumably from the use of fetal bovine serum in the growth medium: bovine lumican, bovine hemoglobin, and bsa .

circular dichroism
the cd spectra of the pln. <dig> and pln. <dig> differ slightly , likely due to the probable cysteine knot structure at the c-terminus of pln. <dig>  analysis of the spectra by raussens method predicts pln. <dig> to be  <dig> % helical,  <dig> % strand,  <dig> % coil, and  <dig> % turn, and pln. <dig> to be  <dig> % helix,  <dig> % strand,  <dig> % random coil, and  <dig> % turn.

cs and hs decorate rhpln.d <dig> but not together
to assess the relative contributions of cs and hs to each of the recombinants, aliquots of the high mr rhpln.d <dig> preparations were digested with heparinases i, ii, or iii, or with chondroitinase abc, or with mammalian heparanase . by western blot, treatment with heparinase i or ii produced no measurable change in the staining pattern in either of the recombinant pools . treatment with heparinase iii resulted in the appearance of low mr species similar to those seen early in the elution profile . treatment with chondroitinase abc resulted in significant loss of the major pln.d <dig> immunoreactivity and a more dense low mr band. treatment of the recombinant proteoglycans with the combination of heparinases and chondroitinase abc resulted in further elimination of the higher mr immunoreactivity, and greater density in the low mr band. treatment with mammalian heparanase did not demonstrate a clearly observable specific activity against the recombinant pools by this assay . in summary, data from these experiments suggested that recombinant synthesis of different pln.d <dig> variants in these two different cell types generated similar hs and cs levels. also, it is important to note that digestion with either heparinase iii or chondroitinase abc did not produce intermediate bands of immunoreactivity or silver staining between the high mr rhpln.d <dig> and the dominant digest products ; this suggested that the core proteins were either fully decorated with hs  or fully decorated with cs , and that there were negligible hybrids.

fgf- <dig> binding is mediated by rhpln.d <dig> hs but not cs
knowing that a significant proportion of the rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> was glycosylated with hs, we tested the hypothesis that the rhpln.d <dig> would bind fgf- <dig>  applying rhfgf- <dig> in solution to the electrophoretically separated recombinant pools that had been immobilized on a nitrocellulose blot , the fgf- <dig> bound specifically to the rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig>  further, digestion with heparinase iii, but not chondroitinase abc, mostly eliminated fgf binding to the enriched rhpln.d <dig> in this system.

solid phase binding analysis of rhfgf- <dig> to the rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> demonstrated an estimated kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm for each, which was similar to binding of rhfgf- <dig> with a commercial hspg  . binding was the same when capturing the rhpln.d <dig> in the high mr preparations onto a solid-phase anti-perlecan mab 001- <dig> ensuring that binding of fgf- <dig> to the enriched high mr pln.d <dig> was a result of binding to the rhpln. <dig> and not a contaminant .

rhpln.d <dig> hs mediates binding to several growth factors
nitrocellulose immobilization of several growth factors and immunoblot analysis confirmed binding of rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> with the growth factors rhfgf- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  rhbmp- <dig>  rhpdgf-bb, and vegf <dig> . a significant reduction in binding signal for each resulted from pre-treating the rhpln.d <dig> with heparinase iii  suggesting some gf affinity for hs. no binding with rhfgf- <dig>  or rhegf, rhigf, bmp- <dig>  and vegf <dig>  was detected by these methods. results were similar using the rhpln. <dig> .

mitogenic activity of rhpln. <dig> and rhpln.198
a mitogenic dose response to rhpln. <dig> by huvec in low-serum growth medium occurred . using baf <dig> cells, which have a limited mitogenic response to growth factors and express only the fgfr1c receptor, we demonstrated rhpln.247-dependant mitogenicity through the fgf-2/fgfr1c activation pathway . similar results were obtained with rhpln. <dig> also demonstrating a dose-dependent synergistic response of huvec to rhpln. <dig> in the presence of constant rhfgf- <dig> levels .

discussion
graham et al had demonstrated that a human perlecan domain  <dig> recombinant from hek  <dig> cells was 67% hs, but that a fusion of domain  <dig> with the large c-terminal globular protein egfp resulted in a 100% hs recombinant, similar to what is typically found in the native perlecan  <cit> . also, doege et al showed a predominately hs decoration of recombinant pln.d <dig> when expressed with domains ii and iii in cos- <dig> cells  <cit> . it appears, therefore, that structural changes to the c-terminus of domain  <dig> of perlecan can have a qualitative role in the post-translational glycosaminoglycan decoration of the core, and it is all the more interesting that the rhpln. <dig> and the rhpln. <dig>  which are different by  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus, were similar in their cs/hs ratio of approximately 2: <dig>  further, by gel analysis of glycosidase-treated recombinants  using both western blot , silver stain and stains-all , recombinant was shown to be predominately synthesized with either only hs glycosylation or only cs glycosylation, but not with both, similar to the two pools of rhpln.d <dig> previously demonstrated using the mouse perlecan, one having only hs and the other containing cs  <cit> .

it is postulated that the action of two separate enzymes dictates whether a beta-galnac or alpha-glcnac linkage is formed following the linker tetrasaccharide, hence initiating a cs or hs gag, respectively . in our work, separate pools of homogenous gag types may have derived from variable, or more labile, tertiary structures of the truncated core proteins that favored either hs or cs enzymatic initiation. alternatively, signals for specific hs or cs initiation, possibly relating to differential transit through the golgi, were removed in truncation resulting in balanced populations of hs or cs species initiated in either the golgi or trans-golgi network, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, the relatively higher proportion of cs-pln.d <dig> in our enriched pools may be due to lower intravesicular ph, where more acidic vesicles are more likely to result in relatively less hs and relatively more cs  <cit> . accordingly, the calculated pi of the rhpln.d <dig> is an acidic  <dig>  as compared to a pi of  <dig>  for the full length perlecan core.

these data demonstrated synthesis of recombinant pln.d <dig> with highly heterogenous gag chains contributing approximately 6- <dig> kda to the rhpln.d <dig> core, consistent with the hs chain length previously estimated in rhpln.d <dig> characterized elsewhere  <cit>  but greater than what had been estimated for recombinant mouse pln.d <dig>  also expressed in hek  <dig> cells  <cit>  or in cho k <dig> cells  <cit> . in anion exchange chromatography, we hypothesized that recombinant pln.d <dig> would elute primarily by degree of sulfation, though what we found was that the species with the lower net apparent kda  eluted earliest. with increasing salt eluted rhpln.d <dig> species with increasing gag length and greater apparent kda. this would also suggest an overall similarity throughout each of the synthesized recombinant populations with regard to net sulfation.

not only does the primary sequence of pln.d <dig> permit both hs and cs  <cit> , but the cell type in which pln is produced can influence the gag composition; mixed forms have been seen in ehs tumor cells  <cit> , and glomerular epithelial cells  <cit> . sulfation patterns on perlecan can also vary significantly depending on the cell type, and endothelial cells, including huvec, have previously been shown  <cit>  to synthesize a perlecan with relatively less fgf- <dig> binding activity than other cell types, emphasizing the potential value of in situ post-translational modification with the use of recombinant biologics for therapy.

typical interactions between fgf- <dig> and hs proteoglycans has been reported to range from kd =  <dig>  nm for syndecan- <dig>  <cit>  to kd =  <dig> nm for the secondary phase of binding to huaec perlecan  <cit> , to kd =  <dig> nm for hs recovered from mouse embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> . our estimated kd of  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm for fgf- <dig> binding to both rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> synthesized by hek  <dig> cells was similar in magnitude and virtually identical to the apparent net affinity of rhfgf- <dig> for a commercial hspg. these data support the hypothesis that the quality of the hs decorating the rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> are quite similar.

while cs of rhpln.d <dig> has been shown to bind rhfgf- <dig>  <cit> , in our system, chondroitinase abc insignificantly affected the rhpln. <dig> or rhpln. <dig> binding to fgf- <dig>  our data suggested that hs participated in fgf- <dig> binding to the rhpln.d <dig> synthesized in hek  <dig> cells while cs did not significantly contribute to the gf binding, similar to data reported for a pool of mouse pln.d <dig> produced in a similar cell line  <cit> . baf <dig> cells are an il- <dig> dependent and hspg deficient myeloid b cell line which have been stably transfected with either fgfr1c or fgfr3c  <cit> . the data presented here clearly demonstrated a strong co-receptor activity of the rhpln. <dig> with the rhfgf- <dig> signalling through the fgfr1c. interestingly, mitogenic dose dependence of rhpln. <dig> in baf <dig> cell culture supplemented with fgf- <dig> was also in the presence of low-level heparin. while the fgf-2/heparin combination provided no mitogenic effect, the fgf-2/rhpln.d <dig> combination in the presence of the heparin was highly mitogenic, highlighting the functional difference between the recombinant hspg and heparin resulting from qualitative and quantitative differences in sulfation.

there is good evidence that the hs proteoglycans interact with several growth factors such as the vegfs and bmps via the hs chains  <cit> . data presented support this potentially broad role of hs gags in mediating gf activities and support the possibility of enhanced growth factor function in wound healing through the use of recombinant hs proteoglycans.

currently, no structural data exists for pln.d <dig> and the limited sequence identity of pln.d <dig> with other known structures causes difficulty in modelling of the full domain. the sea domain, approximately  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminus of pln. <dig>  suggests a mixed α-helix and β-sheet configuration. the cd data presented for rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> confirm that hypothesis. rhpln. <dig> spectral analysis demonstrated a difference with rhpln. <dig> in the amount of helix vs. strand, which may be due to the  <dig> additional amino acids forming a c-terminal cysteine knot.

assessment of the enriched recombinant pools using two different antibodies known to recognize domain  <dig> of perlecan  provided additional evidence that the proteoglycan pool was predominately recombinant d <dig> without detectable native d <dig>  support for this derives from published work showing mab a <dig> to react relatively strongly with native perlecan d <dig>  while reacting very weakly with a pln.196-egfp c-terminal fusion protein  <cit> . further support was obtained in our labs with immunoblots demonstrating a significantly reduced binding signal from the a <dig> mab relative to the a <dig> mab for various rhpln.d <dig> species  and elisa data showing poor a <dig> reactivity against rhpln. <dig> and strong reactivity with full-length endothelial perlecan, while a <dig> reacted strongly to both the native full-length perlecan and the truncated recombinant . therefore, contaminating levels of native perlecan within the enriched recombinant preparations would have also been detected with the a <dig> antibody, but were not.

pln.d <dig> plasmid expression has been used to generate relatively high levels of small, soluble, stable recombinant hs proteoglycan. while the benefits of inserting an alternative leader sequence have been described  <cit> , we found that use of the cmv promoter with the native leader sequence had the potential for excellent expression of rhpln. <dig> and rhpln. <dig> from both the adenoviral and plasmid expressions systems, by both hek cells and huvecs. while we did not test constructs with the minimal native kozak-like sequence for ribosome binding, we suspect that improvement of the kozak sequence also contributed to a relative high expression level for these recombinant proteoglycan constructs.

CONCLUSIONS
as more is presented and understood about proteoglycan synthetic pathways and their controlling factors, the applicability and usefulness of a secreted, functional, soluble, relatively small-sized recombinant hs proteoglycan should increase. with consistent synthesis and recovery of a hs-decorated rhpln.d <dig> pool that has the potential to bind and activate growth factors, the use of pln.d <dig> as a research tool and therapeutic adjunct for a number of indications is possible and currently in testing.
