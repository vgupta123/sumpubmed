BACKGROUND
many marine invertebrates have a pelagobenthic life cycle and biofouling by many of these species has a considerable economic impact in marine environments  <cit> . consequently, it is essential to understand the mechanisms regulating the transition between the free-living planktonic larvae and the benthic adult stage. the barnacle balanus amphitrite  <cit>  is a sessile gregarious species that is a model organism for both fundamental and applied larval settlement studies due to its invasive behaviour, its worldwide distribution, and the relative simplicity of manipulating its reproduction in the laboratory. the life cycle of b. amphitrite is characterized by the presence of six planktonic naupliar stages  followed by a non-feeding larval stage, the cyprid, that is specialized to explore the substratum in order to locate a suitable place for permanent attachment. a number of behavioural studies have shown that b. amphitrite cyprids respond to biotic and abiotic factors as they explore the substratum  <cit> . to date however, the paucity of genomic information available for this organism has hindered in-depth mechanistic studies of the surface colonization process.

expressed sequence tag  surveys are fundamental for discovering new genes  <cit>  and they represent an essential step for the molecular characterization of the species of interest. in addition, est-derived information supports genomic sequence annotation by suggesting intron/exon boundaries and the existence of previously undescribed transcription units; consequently, mrna sequences are invaluable in comparative genomics  <cit> . we have therefore prepared an un-substracted cdna library from adult b. amphtrite to identify the most expressed genes within the first few hundreds ests. we hope that the application of molecular probes developed from this est library, in combination with standard methods for behavioural analysis, will allow us to better understand the timing and intensity of gene expression during different life history stages of b. amphitrite. furthermore, few studies have investigated the regulation of the pelagobenthic life-cycle at a molecular level  <cit> , despite its broad distribution in marine invertebrates  <cit> . barnacles are good candidates to become a model system for this purpose, and the development of new molecular tool for these organisms could help to answer fundamental biological questions related to marine life.

quantitative real-time pcr  is regarded as the most sensitive and reliable method to determine levels of mrna transcription  <cit> . the application of qrt-pcr has proved particularly useful for comparative studies, where the expression of genes of interest  in different samples is measured against the expression of endogenous reference genes . this normalization procedure is fundamental to minimize inherent variability introduced during the rna extraction or the reverse transcription steps  <cit> . ideally, rgs should both maintain a stable transcription level in all cells, tissues or individuals under investigation and should not be influenced by the experimental conditions. unfortunately, many studies have shown that universal rgs for data normalization do not exist and for this reason, the selection of the best rgs should be validated for every new qrt-pcr assay  <cit> .

here, we describe the first characterization of the b. amphitrite transcriptome that is based on the creation of an est library from adult individuals. the sequencing and annotation of  <dig> clones provides the background for further analysis of life-cycle regulation in this organism. we also established a qrt-pcr assay to monitor gene expression in different developmental stages and in individuals exposed to morphogenetic cues. the ability of  <dig> b. amphitrite transcripts to normalize qrt-pcr data was determined by comparing relative quantities obtained from cdnas representing  <dig> different samples and  <dig> developmental stages. the software genorm  <cit> , bestkeeper  <cit> and normfinder  <cit>  were used to obtain an estimation of the expression stability of each gene and, by comparing the results, to identify the most suitable genes for qrt-pcr data normalization in b. amphitrite.

RESULTS
annotation of sequences from the ests library
balanus amphitrite is one of the most extensively studied barnacles and has been suggested as a candidate genetic model for larval settlement and metamorphosis  <cit> . recently, thiyagarajan and qian used a proteomics approach to investigate settlement regulation in this organism  <cit> . however, they argued that the lack of deposited gene sequences hindered a full appreciation of their results. the creation of an adult b. amphitrite cdna library, the sequence of  <dig> clones  and the detection of  <dig> singlets and  <dig> tentative contiguous  sequences  is thus an important first-step towards understanding the molecular ecology of this barnacle. among the  <dig> different genes we report,  <dig> appeared to be of mitochondrial origin and  <dig> showed similarities with previously published ribosomal sequences. gene ontology entries  <cit>  revealed that the main categories of the genes found in our library appear to be involved in electron transport, protein biosynthesis, catalytic activity, metal ion binding, metabolism and the biogenesis of structural elements such as muscle and cuticle . approximately 38% of the unique sequences we obtained have been functionally annotated and a corresponding gene name proposed, and informative annotation has been given for an additional 18%. of the remaining ests, 8% had a blast match with uncharacterized transcripts and 37% showed no appreciable similarity to previously published sequences. this distribution of ests among known/uncharacterized/unknown genes does not differ substantially from that found in recent est surveys on other marine invertebrates  <cit> . we also determined several transcripts that were highly similar to sequences derived from the deposited complete mitochondrial genomes of the two barnacles megabalanus volcano and tetraclita japonica.

vector clipped ests longer than  <dig> nucleotides and with an e-value > e- <dig> were functionally annotated whenever possible. blast hits with e-values < e- <dig> were included in the unassigned proteins. unknown ests in our dataset are those with no match in sequence databases. these ests were considered to be of genomic dna origin as it is unlikely that the highly conserved mitochondrial gene would not result in a blast hit.

fragment assembly generated a total of  <dig> tc comprising  <dig> ests. sequences belonging to  <dig> different tcs were particularly frequent in our library, with the most common being an unassigned mitochondrial gene partly similar to 16s rrna , followed by cytochrome c oxidase subunit i , cysteine proteinase , cytochrome c oxidase subunit ii , cytochrome b , a ribosomal rna internal transcribed spacer , cytochrome c oxidase subunit iii  and the elongation factor 1-Î± . the longest tc generated was  <dig> nucleotides and translated for the18s rrna gene. considering the  <dig> unique sequences we obtained, a total of  <dig> had a match in the ncbi nucleotide database. a taxonomic subdivision of the first hit produced by these  <dig> transcripts showed that  <dig> of them matched sequences from barnacles. the remaining sequences were represented among insects, vertebrates, arachnids, plants, fungi and various other groups . to annotate b. amphitrite's genes, the proposed nomenclature for drosophila melanogaster was used as a guide  and the corresponding gene symbol established in d. melanogaster was used when possible. however, in a slight departure, we decided to use the prefix mt- to identify mitochondrial genes.

validation of best reference genes for qrt-pcr
our main interests focus on elucidating those genes involved in barnacle settlement. in this respect, qrt-pcr is particularly suitable to monitor how external cues, such as environmental variables, the presence of conspecific individuals or the occurrence of biofilm and/or of certain microorganisms, influence gene expression prior to and during settlement and metamorphosis. since most of the annotated ests we found represent highly expressed housekeeping genes, this suggests that information from a few hundred clones derived from a cdna library is sufficient to validate rgs for subsequent qrt-pcr studies.

we selected  <dig> potential rgs and designed pcr primer pairs to them . these genes were chosen either because they were commonly used for other organisms or because they were often found in the est library and their functional description indicated they might be useful candidate genes. of the  <dig> primer pairs we tested, three  produced pcr artefacts and therefore were discarded from our analysis without attempting to design new primer pairs for them as we considered a total of  <dig> genes to be adequate for our analysis. primer efficiencies of the remaining  <dig> rgs varied between 84% and 100% . to obtain reliable results it is important to achieve equivalent pcr efficiencies for the reference genes and the gene of interests. therefore, pairs with a comparatively lower efficiency  were kept in our analysis as they can be useful when investigating gois for which it is difficult to design primers with high efficiency.

the expression levels of rgs were obtained from qrt-pcr reactions in the form of threshold cycle  values . the  <dig> ct values collected for each primer pair were derived from the two biological replicates of the seven developmental stages under investigation . these samples were initially considered independent and the data they generated were analyzed with genorm  <cit> , bestkeeper  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit>  to determine the most steadily expressed genes. it can be argued that two biological replicates are not enough for statistical analysis, and this is the case for many biological systems  where at least five replicates should be performed. in our investigation, however, the rna was extracted from ten  to hundreds of pooled individuals, so that the rna could be considered an average sample of the developmental stage analysed. in our opinion, the high correlation found between the two biological replicates, at least for the most stably expressed genes , confirmed our expectations.

the software genorm provides a ranking of the tested genes based on their stability measure , determining the two most stable rgs or a combination of multiple stable genes for normalization. the value m represents the mean pair-wise variation between a gene and all other tested candidates. the gene with the highest m is then excluded from the analysis and the calculation is repeated in a stepwise fashion that allows genes ranking until the best two genes are found. according to genorm, the two most stable genes in our assay were mt-nd <dig> and mt-cyb , with an m value of  <dig> . the threshold value m for considering a gene to be unsuitable for data normalization is suggested to be â¥  <dig>   <cit> . low values of the pair-wise variation v between two sequential normalization factors containing an increasing number of genes showed it was unnecessary to include another rg in our protocol . however, as mt-nd <dig> and mt-cyb are both contained in the mitochondrial genome, it may be advisable to include a nuclear gene in the normalization strategy. in this case, genorm suggested that either act or ef1a should be used.

we excluded the highly variable tuba sequence from the analysis using bestkeeper  <cit> , which can only consider  <dig> rgs. since any gene calculated by bestkeeper to have a standard deviation > <dig> can be considered inconsistent, we also excluded cp <dig>  from the final calculation of the bestkeeper index. this index is a representation of the average over/under-regulation of all genes together in every developmental stage. the rg that best correlated with the bestkeeper index was mt-acp, followed by rpl <dig>  ef1a and mt-cyb . in other words, mt-acp appeared to be the best candidate to represent the overall modulation of expression of the  <dig> rgs analysed. however, mt-acp was also the least stable gene  and this was likely to influence the index to which it correlated. nevertheless, the most stable gene, resulting from the bestkeeper analysis, was again mt-cyb, followed by mt-nd <dig> and rpl <dig> .

normfinder attempts to identify the optimal normalization gene among a set of candidates and provides a measure of the stability of genes' expression in different groups and at the same time estimates any bias in the expression of the genes between the groups based on two-way anova  <cit> . when all data were analysed together, the most stable rg candidates in our essay using normfinder were mt-cyb , rpl <dig>  and mt-acp , as shown in figure  <dig>  we then repeated the analysis grouping samples by developmental stage to assess intergroup variability. in this case, the best genes that allows comparison of different developmental stages and/or treatments in b. amphitrite, which was the goal of this study, were mt-cyb , mt-nd <dig>  and mt-acp , suggesting that these are the most suitable genes for data normalization. a last examination was performed adding the data to normfinder as two subgroups . as a result, the software produced the same gene ranking by their stability values, showing a very low variability between replicates, which was also confirmed by further statistical analysis; pearson correlation coefficients of biological replicates for all rgs tested ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> , with  <dig> genes out of  <dig> showing a significant correlation at the  <dig>  level . although the use of only  <dig> data points may affect the examination, our results suggested that the implemented protocol is effective in capturing meaningful differences in gene expression throughout b. amphitrite development.

as a general consideration, although genorm, bestkeeper and normfinder have the same aim, they employ different strategies to calculate the most stable genes and it is unlikely that they will give the same results. for example, looking at the absolute ranking of best genes, mt-acp scored 5th, 9th and 3rd. however, its stability values as determined by the tree software do not change substantially from that of the genes ranked closely  was  <dig>  and that of act  was  <dig> ). finally, it was noted that ct values for the best rgs tended to increase during the life cycle. this was particularly evident with the cdna derived from adult barnacles, which required ~ <dig> to  <dig> more cycles to reach the pcr exponential phase in comparison to the cdna from larvae that had just hatched . while we cannot exclude the possibility that the genes analysed are down-regulated in the adult stage, this trend could also be explained by the presence of reverse transcription inhibitors that concentrate or are synthesized in later stages of b. amphitrite development, as rt-inhibitors are known to be one of the main sources of variability in qrt-pcr experiments  <cit> . although the ct value shifts remained in an acceptable range, it may be advisable to include a reference assay to rule out the presence of inhibitors. this is commonly achieved by adding an aliquot of the rna under investigation to a well characterised exogenous rna and measuring the effect on the amplification of the cdna derived from the latter  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
balanus amphitrite is already established as a model organism to study the pelagobenthic life cycle. here, we have presented the first cdna library sequenced from adult b. amphitrite. we are currently generating three further normalized est libraries for the developmental stages of nauplius i, cyprid and adult, and we estimate that another  <dig>  sequences will be available soon. the addition of this genetic information will serve as an invaluable tool to investigate gene expression in barnacles. the three programs implemented to analyse qrt-pcr results indicated that tuba, tubb and cp <dig> are unsuitable genes for data normalization. they also showed that mt-cyb itself, and the pair mt-cyb â mt-nd <dig>  were the genes expressed most stably throughout life cycle of b. amphitrite, and so we recommend their use as reliable reference genes in future qrt-pcr experiments. other genes that performed well in our analyses were mt-acp, rpl <dig>  mt-nd4l, ef1a, ubc and act.
