BACKGROUND
during the life cycle of eukaryotic cells, dna replication is restricted to a specific time window, the s phase. several control mechanisms ensure that each chromosomal dna sequence is replicated once, and only once, in the period from one cell division to the next. following s phase, replicated chromosomes separate during mitosis  and segregate in two nuclei that are then endowed to two newborn cells at division. two gap phases, called g <dig> and g <dig>  separate cell birth from s phase and s phase from m phase, respectively.

when depleted of growth factors, mammalian cells leave g <dig> to enter a reversible quiescent state, referred to as g <dig>  <cit> . upon growth factor refeeding, signal transduction pathways are activated, ultimately leading to s phase onset. a major control point in the g0/g <dig> to s transition has been first identified by pardee  <cit> , who called it the restriction  point. it is defined as the point of the cell cycle in g <dig>  after which a cell can enter s phase after removal of growth factors. it occurs at a specific time in g <dig> after re-addition of growth factors, before initiation of s phase. quiescent cells, before reaching the r point, need continual feeding of nutrients, mitogens and survival factors; in contrast, past the r point, they are irrevocably committed to divide independently from the continuous presence of growth factors in the medium  <cit> . a control point responding to nutrient availability but with otherwise similar properties, exists also in lower eukaryotes, such as the budding yeast, where it has been named start  <cit> .

the restriction point r operates stringently in normal cells, but it is defective in cancer cells that accumulate mutations resulting in constitutive mitogenic signaling and defective responses to anti-mitogenic signals that contribute to unscheduled proliferation  <cit> . mutations that affect the execution of the restriction point mainly occur in two classes of genes: proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . in normal cells, the products of proto-oncogenes act at different levels along the signaling and regulatory pathways that stimulate cell proliferation. mutated versions of proto-oncogenes are able to promote tumor growth. of the more than  <dig> proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been identified, most function in signal transduction to mimic effects of persistent mitogenic stimulation, thereby uncoupling cells from environmental cues  <cit> . their signaling pathways converge on the cycle machinery controlling the passage through the g <dig> phase, by inducing g <dig> cyclins and overriding cdk inhibitors, preventing cell cycle exit, and ultimately perturbing checkpoint controls  <cit> . in the wealth of known oncogenes, many findings indicate that pathways controlled by two tumor suppressor genes, rb and p <dig>  have been found to be the most frequently disrupted in cancer cells  <cit> . indeed, inactivation of these two tumor suppressor genes results in dysfunction of proteins that normally inhibit cell cycle progression, resulting in either continued proliferation or unscheduled re-entry into the cell cycle, two properties characteristic of most cancer cells  <cit> . also the nucleo/cytoplasmic localization of key cell cycle players is relevant: for instance, enhanced cancer aggressiveness has been found to be linked to a preferential cytoplasmic localization of the cdk inhibitor p27kip <dig>  <cit> .

the aim of the present report has been to construct a mathematical model of the molecular events that bring a normal quiescent mammalian cell to overcome the restriction point and to enter into s phase. the idea that the logic of cell cycle control is substantially conserved from yeast to mammalian cells is widely accepted  <cit> . besides, considering relevant the nucleo/cytoplasmic localization of cell cycle players, that is not taken into focus even in recent mathematical models of the g <dig> to s transition in mammalian cells  <cit> , we gave specific attention to this aspect in modeling the dynamics of s phase entrance. by using as a framework the model of the g <dig> to s transition in budding yeast developed in our laboratories  <cit> , we present here a computational network model of the dynamics of entrance into s phase of quiescent, normal mammalian cells that is based on extensive data-mining  and constrained by accompanying experimental data obtained on murine fibroblasts synchronized by serum starvation and stimulated by serum addition to enter s phase. the model allows us to identify the molecular mechanism that underlies the r point, yields specific predictions and gives new insights on the role that the availability of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases  may have on the entrance into s phase.

RESULTS
building a mathematical model of the g <dig> to s transition network for mammalian cells
the data-mining, conducted in order to construct the network of the molecular events that characterize the transition from quiescence into s phase, is described in detail in the appendix. the relevant players of the network that we considered are: two cyclin/cdk complexes, i.e. cyclin d1/cdk <dig>  and cyclin e/cdk2; one cki inhibitor; the transcription factor e2f and its inhibitor rb. the nucleo/cytoplasmic localization and the regulatory kinases/phosphatases of this pathway were also taken into account. the following classes of events have been considered:  production and degradation of mrnas and proteins;  formation of dimeric and trimeric protein complexes;  nucleo/cytoplasmic localization of the compounds, transport processes being described like reactions, ;  cell growth in terms of volume increase; and hence  concentration changes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. the resulting network was drawn using the notation of cell designer  <cit>   and the corresponding ode-based mathematical model was derived . it describes the dynamics of how different molecular species interact with each other and how they shuttle between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.

in essence, the time courses of the network can be summarized as follows . the first relevant events involve the interplay between the growth-dependent cyclin d, and a generic cki whose properties more closely resemble those of p27kip <dig>  that has been directly linked to cancer  <cit> , while the role of p21cip <dig> in cell cycle was not considered. cki is endowed to each newborn cell at the end of the previous cycle and plays a dual role, being involved both in inhibition of activity – and promotion of translocation – of cyclin d1/cdk <dig>  and of cyclin e/cdk <dig> complexes. in keeping with the notion that cki-deleted cells are able to translocate cdk-containing complexes in the nucleus, both complexes are able to translocate in the nucleus either in the cki-bound or unbound-form. as cyclin d <dig> builds-up following addition of growth factors to quiescent cells, the cyclin d1/cdk <dig>  complex moves to the nucleus, either alone or bound to cki. upon phosphorylation of rb by nuclear, cak-phosphorylated cyclin d1/cdk <dig> , the e2f/rb complex starts to dissociate and e2f-dependent productions of cdc25a, cyclin e and of more e2f free begins. for simplicity, we assume that all newly-made cdc25a and e2f will move into the nucleus. hence, nuclear production rates of these proteins  sum-up transcription, mrna export to the cytoplasm, translation and nuclear translocation of the mature protein. only for cyclin e synthesis and export refer to mrna production, and a separate translation step is modeled in the cytoplasm.

as cyclin e synthesis proceeds, the cyclin e/cdk <dig> complex builds-up and goes to the nucleus, alone or assisted by cki. nuclear cyclin e/cdk <dig> is sequentially phosphorylated by wee <dig> and cak. after activation by cdc25a, that removes the wee1-catalyzed inhibitory phosphorylation, cyclin e/cdk <dig> completes rb phosphorylation. cyclin e/cdk <dig> then is taken to phosphorylate a generic activator of the onset of dna replication  that triggers initiation of dna replication.

an experimental analysis of the entrance into s phase of quiescent mammalian cells
in order to have available an experimental set of data useful to constrain the parameter estimation of the mathematical model described in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig>  nih3t <dig> murine fibroblasts, brought to quiescence by a  <dig> hours serum deprivation and stimulated by serum addition for another  <dig> hours, were analyzed. in the cell population the overcoming of the r point starts at  <dig> hours and is almost completed at  <dig> hours , while the entrance into s phase starts at 8– <dig> hours and is completed at  <dig> hours , following the pattern described in literature  <cit> . the heterogeneity with which cells overcome the r point and enter into s phase is most likely due to the limiting concentration of "competence" factors, like pdgf  <cit> , which are required to rescue the cells from the quiescent state stimulating them to grow and to activate the pathways needed to resume proliferation  <cit> . adding 10% serum, the concentration of "competence" factors is limiting: therefore, the interaction of growth factors with their cognate cellular receptors follows a first order kinetics  <cit> . enough exposition to the competence factors contained in the serum allows a cell to overcome the r point and to enter into s phase a fixed time after execution of the r point. in order to fit experimental data we must remember that while each individual cell shows a switch-like response for r point overcoming and entrance into s phase , cells in a population interact with growth factors according to a first-order kinetics. assuming a half-life of  <dig> hrs , satisfactory fitting  can be obtained for experimental data . this analysis indicates that overcoming of the r point at the individual cell level takes place after  <dig> hrs in the presence of the competence factors present in serum and that  <dig> hrs later s phase starts.

then, the content of several cell cycle proteins was estimated  by western blot analysis . it is clear that quiescent cells  are characterized by very low levels of cyclin d and cyclin e, by sizable levels of cdk <dig>  cdk <dig> and cki p27kip <dig>  at 4– <dig> hrs the level of cyclin d substantially increases, while that of p27kip <dig> starts to decrease. at 6– <dig> hrs cyclin e starts to be detectable, while p27kip <dig> disappears almost completely. the localization analysis  indicates that in quiescent cells the great majority of p27kip <dig> is localized into the nucleus, while cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> are localized both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.

parameter estimation, computational analysis and simulated dynamics of key players during the g <dig> to s transition
the model was constrained to fit the observed experimental behavior of the g <dig> to s transition  and of relevant players considered in the network . rate constants and values at the beginning of the simulations  were derived considering both the experimental values described above and literature data as described in the appendix. cells resume growth with their characteristic exponential rate  as soon as growth factors are added. results of a  <dig> hours simulation of the g <dig> to s transition are reported in figure  <dig>  levels of both cdk <dig>  and cdk <dig>  show little change over the time frame considered in our simulations , consistently with experimental data . the rise in cyclin d <dig>  is a quite early event and is followed a few hours later by a rise of cyclin e . has to be noted that since we are simulating the g <dig> to s transition and not a full cell cycle, time courses of some variables become meaningless after entrance into s phase. simulation results for cki  show progressive time-dependent degradation. similarly, the level of p27kip <dig> appears to diminish smoothly within the first part of the serum-stimulation experiment, then it disappears almost completely as shown by both western blot and immunofluorescence . the final output of the g <dig> to s simulation, i.e. the phosphorylated s phase activator starts to be present at 8– <dig> hours , consistent with the timing experimentally determined. in summary, considering both the final output of the system  and the dynamics of selected key components, the dynamics of the system are in agreement with experimental data shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> and with literature data discussed in more detail in the appendix.

simulated localization of cycle proteins and complexes
immunofluorescent localization data shown in figure 3b indicate that cyclins, cdks and cki can be detected in the nucleus. indeed, in order to be able to phosphorylate their targets, cdk-containing complexes must efficiently reach the nucleus, i.e. a sizable fraction of each complex must be present within the nucleus. figure  <dig> reports the simulated fraction of nuclear cyclin d  and cyclin d-containing binary and ternary complexes  in the upper row, while the bottom row displays the simulated fraction of nuclear cyclin e  and cyclin e-containing binary and ternary complexes . both cyclins and their complexes are efficiently transported to the nucleus, despite the fact that at time  <dig> cyclins are found only in the cytoplasm where they are synthesized, indicating that the transport kinetics implemented in the model are able to efficiently drive the system.

the carrier-function of cki: gene dosage effects
it has been reported that p27kip <dig> over-expression correlates with cell cycle arrest  <cit>  and, conversely, that its degradation is a key pre-requisite for entry into s phase  <cit> . at the same time, a role for ckis in promoting nuclear transport and/or assembly of cyclin/cdk complexes has also been shown  <cit> . such a dual role has been incorporated in our model since:  only nuclear cyclin/cdk complexes – but not cyclin/cdk/cki complexes – are able to phosphorylate relevant substrates and  cyclin/cdk/cki ternary complexes enter the nucleus 5-fold faster than corresponding cyclin/cdk binary complexes . as noted above, in our model the entrance into s phase is accounted for as phosphorylation of the s phase activator, assuming the s phase entrance to be proportional to the level reached by the phosphorylated activator at the end of the simulation, i.e.  <dig> hours after "serum stimulation". accordingly, figure  <dig> reports the effects of changing cki concentration on s phase entrance, when the rate constants for nuclear transport of ternary cyclin/cdk/cki complexes are the same , 5-fold higher  and 25-fold higher  than those of the binary cyclin/cdk complexes. cki concentration is shown on a log scale, taking as  <dig> the cki concentration used in our reference set. if the cki has no transport-promoting effect, i.e. if cyclin/cdk/cki ternary complexes enter the nucleus as fast as the corresponding cyclin/cdk binary complexes, increasing cki concentration has a purely negative effect on the entrance into s phase . the inhibitory effect is partially overcome when cyclin/cdk/cki ternary complexes enter the nucleus 5-fold  or 25-fold  faster than corresponding cyclin/cdk binary complexes. the s phase promoting effect is more evident at lower cki concentration and is completely lost at a relative concentration of  <dig> or higher when s phase entrance is completely shut-off, regardless of whether there is any advantage for the transport of the ternary complexes over the binary complexes or not.

comparison of simulated and experimental overcoming of the restriction point
the r point was experimentally determined as follows. quiescent cells were exposed to serum for variable periods of time and then transferred to serum-free medium. the fraction of brdu-positive cells was measured at the end of the incubation period  and is plotted in figure 2a in correspondence of the time spent in the presence of serum. while cells exposed for only  <dig> hours were not able to enter s phase, almost 40% of cells stimulated with serum for  <dig> hours were brdu-positive, i.e. entered s phase when assayed at  <dig> hours, after  <dig> hours of serum starvation.

the corresponding computational experiment involved running the simulation with parameters and starting conditions reported in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  for different times, stopping the run, and re-starting it with cyclin d synthesis shut-off, cyclin d degradation increased and cki synthesis turned-on , to simulate growth factor removal. starting conditions of the second part of the simulation for all variables corresponded to those reached when "on" condition simulation was first stopped. ability to enter s phase was estimated as described in the previous paragraph. values of the phosphorylated s phase activator at the end of each  <dig> hours run  are plotted as a function of the simulation time in the "on" condition.

CONCLUSIONS
the cell cycle is a complex process that allows eukaryotic cells to replicate dna and partition it into two daughter cells. its regulation is exceedingly complex and must take into account – and integrate – intracellular and extracellular signals. multi-cellular organisms must also coordinate cell cycle of their component cells in order to keep harmonic and functional arrangement of tissues and organs. such a coordination mostly take place within the g0/g <dig> phase at a point called the restriction  point  <cit> . alteration in the r point and ensuing inability to coordinate entry into the cell cycle with mitogenic and nutritional signals leads to unregulated proliferation and ultimately to cancer  <cit> .

such a central physio-pathological role of cell cycle has stimulated a wealth of computational studies aimed to capture the logic of its functioning through mathematical analysis of the specific molecular mechanism involved in the process. different mathematical models, specifically focused on the g <dig> to s transition in the mammalian cells, have been reported  <cit>  and each one uses a specific approach and/or focuses on specific components to simulate the cell cycle dynamics. these include models published by: kohn  <cit>  whose core module is the e2f-prb complex; aguda and co-workers  <cit>  whose r point model involves both d-type and e-type cyclins, and their cognate kinases cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  the inhibitor p27kip <dig>  and the mitogenic signals in the r-point transition; qu and collaborators  <cit>  in  <dig>  whose model considers multiple phosphorylation sites for the components involved in the regulation of the g <dig> to s transition, which is a crucial point in the cell cycle process and strengthens the involvement of e2f1/prb and cdc25a in r point execution; swat and co-workers  <cit>  whose model considers only few components in the g1/s transition, but they aim to identify the small feedback loops in the regulation process of the r-point transition in terms of bifurcation analysis; haberichter and collaborators  <cit>  whose model is based on the presence of an unknown "modifier" that activates cdk <dig> in response to metabolic signals; similar to the proposal of tyson and novak  <cit>  they assign an important role in the g <dig> to s transition to a-type cyclins, that are reported in literature to be required more for the execution – rather than for the onset – of s phase  <cit> .

a generic model for the restriction point control of the mammalian cell cycle was presented by novak and tyson in  <dig>  <cit> . neither their model, nor subsequent extensions  <cit>  nor the other cell cycle models presented so far explicitly consider nucleus/cytoplasm localization.

the major novelty of the mathematical model of entry of quiescent mammalian fibroblasts into s phase upon stimulation by growth factors that we present here is the explicit account of the nucleo/cytoplasmic localization of cell cycle players that shuttle between the two compartments as well as of cell growth. consistently with the notion that the core cell cycle machinery appears to be conserved in all eukaryotes, from yeast to human  <cit> , our mathematic model is based on the network of the g <dig> to s transition in budding yeast  <cit>  that explicitly considers nucleus/cytoplasm localization. besides, the choice of parameters of our model has been constrained by experimental data obtained on murine fibroblasts synchronized by serum starvation and stimulated by serum to enter s phase, while the several models previously described  <cit>  were based only on theoretical considerations or experimental data taken from literature.

it is worthwhile to underline similarities and differences among the g <dig> to s network of budding yeast  <cit>  and mammals . the yeast model incorporated two ckis, while only a single cki is considered in the present mammalian model. as outlined above, the single cki more closely resembles p27kip <dig>  whose role in cell proliferation and cancer is well established, purposefully neglecting p21cip <dig> and inhibitors of the ink family  <cit> . both models incorporate a dual  role for a cki, namely sic <dig> in budding yeast and p27kip <dig> in mammals. functional equivalence between yeast and mammalian cyclin complexes in our models is as follows: cln3/cdk <dig> to cyclin d/cdk <dig> ; clb <dig> /cdk <dig> to cyclin e/cdk <dig>  slightly different from that proposed by other authors  <cit> . in the mammalian model, no equivalent of the yeast cln <dig> /cdk <dig> complex is present, given the fact that the cln/cdk complexes play a major role in promoting budding, that is a yeast-specific process. functional equivalence between yeast and mammalian cyclin/cdk complexes have been reported by other authors. in the yeast model  <cit>  and in the present one, a relevant role is played by cyclin/cdk phosphorylation of functionally equivalent inhibitors  that originates a free transcription factor  that drives transcription of genes required to enter s phase. while the molecular logic is the same, some mechanistic details differ, since a single kinase  phosphorylates whi <dig> in yeast, while cyclin d/cdk <dig>  and cyclin e/cdk <dig> sequentially phosphorylate the rb inhibitor in mammals.

simulations of the model allows to recapitulate events happening from growth factor stimulation  and shows successive building-up of cyclin d and cyclin e with a timing consistent with the experimental ones. active complexes are found in the nucleus at appropriate times and building-up of the phosphorylated s phase activator is also consistent with experimental data. removal of the growth factor  allows to construct a restriction point curve that is similar to the one experimentally determined. it should be noted here that experimental curves are obtained on a cell population, i.e. they represent the fraction of brdu-positive cells, while simulated curves not only refer to a single cell, but they do not show the  onset of s phase, but phosphorylation of a s phase activator whose continuous accumulation will allow trigger  entry into s phase.

cki inhibitors have been proposed to define thresholds for cyclin/cdk activity by setting levels that cyclin-cdk complexes must exceed to become active  <cit> . according to this notion, cell cycle progression or arrest would depend on relative concentration of inhibitors and cyclins: a decrease in cyclin/cdk components or an increase in inhibitor levels would prevent the accumulation of inhibitor-free cyclin/cdk complexes, thus inhibiting cell cycle progression. the sensitivity analysis reported in figures  <dig> and  <dig> is consistent with this notion, but also strongly underlines the biological relevance of the shuttling role of the cki indicating that our model is going to test on a quantitative basis this assumption. figure  <dig> indicates that the effect brought about by cki overexpression is strictly dependent on whether or not the cki is promoting nuclear translocation of cyclin/cdk containing complexes. figure  <dig> shows that cki-related constants , that positively promote formation of the cyclin d/cdk <dig>  complex, affect negatively e2f-rb . constants k <dig> e k <dig> also affect the time course of the production of the phosphorylated s phase activator, i.e. the final output of our system. together, these results show that alterations of the cki dynamics  deeply affects the ability of quiescent cells to respond to growth factors.

further development of the model may include a more sophisticated mathematical analysis of rb phosphorylation. our current model only implements two sequential phosphorylations, while patterns of rb phosphorylation are quite complex . thanks to their ability to act as signaling switches and counting mechanism  <cit> , implementation of multisites protein phosphorylation of rb may contribute to render the g <dig> to s transition steeper and closely resembling an "on/off" switch  <cit> . the same effect would be obtained by direct implementation of the molecular mechanism linking phosphorylation of the s phase activator to s phase triggering that involves its association with the origin recognition complex  at replication origins and subsequent recruitment of other initiation factors, like the mcm proteins  <cit> .
