BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus sensu lato comprises eight species of gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria with greatly varying pathogenic potential. b. cereus sensu stricto, which was discovered in  <dig> as a bacterium occurring ubiquitously in nature  <cit> , contains probiotic as well as pathogenic strains. the latter are mostly associated with food-borne illness characterized by diarrhea or vomiting, but occasionally b. cereus is responsible for severe infections, e.g. endophthalmitis or meningitis  <cit> . the emetic type of b. cereus food poisoning is caused by ingestion of the small, cyclic and heat-stable toxin cereulide  <cit> . the three most important and well-known enterotoxins are the non-hemolytic enterotoxin , hemolysin bl  and cytotoxin k . b. thuringiensis produces insecticidal parasporal protein crystals of cry  and/or cyt  proteins that are mostly encoded on plasmids. occasionally b. thuringiensis have been found to cause human infections very similar to b. cereus  <cit> . b. anthracis is the best known human and animal pathogen of the b. cereus group and was demonstrated to be the causative agent of anthrax by robert koch in  <dig>  <cit> . the anthrax-associated plasmids pxo <dig>  and pxo <dig>  have been found in a few b. cereus strains such as b. cereus g <dig> and b. cereus biovar anthracis ca  <cit>  with a similar pathogenic potential as b. anthracis. b. weihenstephanensis is psychrotolerant and able to grow below  <dig> °c  <cit> . occasionally, this species houses the emetic toxin cereulide  <cit> . the psychrotolerant b. mycoides is closely related to the other b. cereus sensu lato species , but it can easily be distinguished by its rhizoidal colonial growth  <cit> . to our knowledge, no infections by b. mycoides have been reported, but it carries both nhe and hbl and its cytotoxicity was shown  <cit> . within b. mycoides a group of bacteria with a clearly distinguishable fatty acid profile was recognized and described as b. pseudomycoides  <cit> . in  <dig>  a highly enterotoxic and rare variant of cytotoxin k, cytk- <dig>  was discovered in b. cereus nvh 391– <dig>  a strain responsible for severe food poisoning. this strain was published in  <dig> as the type strain of the new species b. cytotoxicus on the basis of presence of the cytk- <dig> gene, its thermotolerance , a distinctive fatty acid profile, dna-dna hybridization and multilocus sequence typing   <cit> . the eighth member of b. cereus sensu lato was isolated in japan in  <dig> but has been described as a separate species b. toyonensis only recently  <cit> . interestingly, it is a commercially available probiotic . b. toyonensis was distinguished from other b. cereus sensu lato type species by pairwise calculations of the average nucleotide identity .

while the trend in prokaryotic species distinction is moving towards comparison of entire genomes  <cit> , differentiation of the closely related b. cereus species is still based on the presence or absence of phenotypic characters. it has been reported that species affiliation of b. cereus group strains often does not match the phylogenetic relatedness  <cit> . one reason for such discrepancies may be the exchange of virulence plasmids between species. plasmids pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> encoding the anthrax toxin complex and the poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule are found not only in b. anthracis, but also in some b. cereus strains  <cit> . the b. cereus cereulide synthetase gene cluster is also located on a large pxo1-like plasmid  <cit>  and is not restricted to a single lineage within b. cereus sensu lato  <cit> . some of the b. thuringiensis insecticidal cry genes are encoded on plasmids  <cit>  and can spread via horizontal gene transfer  among b. cereus sensu lato. therefore, the transfer of a single plasmid from one species to another species may result in a change of species affiliation.

several studies have addressed the general possibility of hgt among b. cereus sensu lato, obtaining controversial results. b. cereus and b. thuringiensis isolates have been studied by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  resulting in a high variety of closely related electrophoretic types, evidence of extensive recombination between species and a low degree of clonality  <cit> . mlst analyses revealed that b. anthracis is a homogeneous and clonal cluster within b. cereus sensu lato, while b. cereus and b. thuringiensis are of higher diversity  <cit> . similar studies have been conducted with a different set of housekeeping genes for mlst, amplified fragment length polymorphism  and genomic comparisons, concluding that hgt involves chromosomal genes and is probably mediated by transposable elements  <cit> . other studies conclude from mlst, aflp, mlee and genomic data that chromosomal recombination events are generally rare, but appear more often among b. cereus/b. thuringiensis, while only plasmids are transmitted by hgt . hgt among distantly related bacteria can be inferred by several approaches  <cit> , but these are difficult to apply when bacteria as closely related as b. cereus sensu lato are investigated  <cit> . conflicting results are therefore not surprising.

while horizontal spread of virulence plasmids is not unusual, little is known about the lateral transfer of chromosomal b. cereus virulence factors  <cit> . therefore, this work aims to systematically evaluate the prevalence and distribution of enterotoxin genes within b. cereus sensu lato, with a focus on horizontal versus vertical gene transfer as well as toxin gene duplication and loss. as an indispensable prerequisite for this task we inferred the phylogeny of b. cereus sensu lato strains based on  <dig> genomes  as well as stable mlsa  phylogeny constructed from seven housekeeping genes of the b. cereus core genome.

RESULTS
de novo sequencing of  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains
in this study whole genomes of  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains with different enterotoxic potential  have been sequenced.  <dig> of them are known members of b. cereus sensu stricto that were either isolated from food or associated with food poisoning cases. b. cereus # <dig>  has been isolated from mouse gut  and b. cereus ip <dig>  is a commercially available probiotic strain   <cit> . additionally, b. mycoides wsbc  <dig> , and b. cytotoxicus cvuas  <dig>   <cit>  were added, because only very few genomes of these species are publicly available. detailed sequencing and assembly data are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  assembly sizes of the newly sequenced strains ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp  and were compared to genome sizes of published b. cereus sensu lato strains. it has been discussed controversially whether well-adapted pathogenic bacteria generally contain smaller genomes  than environmental isolates  <cit> . in our study, some b. cereus sensu lato genomes seem to support this hypothesis of a reduced genome size in pathogens, such as b. anthracis , b. cytotoxicus  and some of the enteropathogenic strains we sequenced. these showed smaller genomes than environmental and innocuous strains . however, several exceptions like the enterotoxic nhe reference strain b. cereus nvh 0075– <dig>  support the notion that genome size does not correlate with pathogenicity.table  <dig> genome size and pathogenicity of  <dig> de novo sequenced b. cereus sensu lato strains


























strains are sorted by assembly size. classification in high/low enterotoxic strains was determined by using a vero cell assay  <cit> . n. d.: not determined



after assembly, the new sequences were screened for the presence and location of virulence determinants and housekeeping genes and used for whole-genome comparison as well as multi-locus sequence analysis.

whole genome comparison confirms seven phylogenetic groups
for taxonomical purposes, and in order to analyze horizontal gene transfer, the construction of a phylogenetic master tree which depicts the assumed “true” phylogenetic relationships of the organisms studied as correctly as possible is mandatory. towards this end, we constructed an mlsa tree  based on concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping genes  <cit>  from the b. cereus sensu lato core genome. the topologies of trees calculated on the basis of individual housekeeping genes are highly similar to this master tree but partially lack resolution due to different levels of conservation . the overall mlsa tree topology was confirmed by an analysis of whole-genome pairwise ani comparison, visualized by a neighbor network . pairwise comparison of ani versus pairwise distances of the seven concatenated housekeeping genes correlated nicely . these results were additionally confirmed by whole-genome snp-based phylogeny . all three methods showed highly similar tree topologies and confirmed that the mlsa tree should correctly display the strain phylogeny of the  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains included in this study.fig.  <dig> mlsa-based species relationship within b. cereus sensu lato. a: the phylogenetic tree  was calculated using the concatenated sequence of seven housekeeping genes from  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains. arrow: suspected first appearance of cytk- <dig>  empty arrows: suspected origin of nhe

based on a more limited mlst approach, using partial gene sequences only as well as a different set of genes than we applied in our mlsa analysis, cardazzo et al.  <cit>  concluded that reticulate evolution of housekeeping genes should be an important factor of b. cereus evolution. based on our whole genome and mlsa analysis we cannot exclude limited reticulate evolution within the seven housekeeping genes used in our study but we suggest that, apparently, this does not mask the strain phylogeny of our b. cereus strain set.

seven phylogenetic clusters of b. cereus sensu lato have been reported previously  <cit>  and these appear also in our data set. the whole genome analysis reveals that these seven phylogenetic groups are separated by at least  <dig> % ani. it has been proposed to use average nucleotide identity between genomes for bacterial species delineation  <cit> . the current species distinction states that a group of strains belonging to one species must have >  <dig> % ddh similarity, <  <dig> °c Δtm, <  <dig> % mol g + c difference of total genomic dna and >  <dig> % 16s rrna identity  <cit> . a boundary of 94– <dig> % ani corresponding to ~  <dig> % ddh similarity was proposed  <cit> . phylogenetic groups within b. cereus sensu lato can be distinguished with a species boundary of  <dig> % identity . when comparing strains that do not belong to the same phylogenetic group with each other, ani values are in the range of 80– <dig> %. our data therefore suggest that seven genomospecies exist within b. cereus sensu lato.fig.  <dig> correlation of pairwise distance of concatenated housekeeping genes with whole genome ani values. a: correlation of whole-genome ani and pairwise distance of seven concatenated housekeeping genes of all  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains. intra-cluster values  are depicted in black, all inter-cluster values in grey. pearson’s correlation of all values is r <dig> =  <dig> . b and c: intra-cluster comparison of whole-genome ani and pairwise distance of seven concatenated housekeeping. cluster affiliation  according to species tree . strains that are difficult to sort into a distinct genomospecies are named and marked by circles. b: clusters i, iv – vi can be distinguished at an ani species boundary of ≥  <dig> %. cluster i: ani  <dig>  %, pairwise distance  <dig>  substitutions per site. cluster vii: ani  <dig>  %, pairwise distance  <dig>  substitutions per site. c: clusters ii and iii cannot be discerned on the basis of the comparisons presented: strain b. cereus f528/ <dig>  is affiliated to cluster iii by mlsa  and whole-genome snp analysis , but to cluster ii by ani 



b. cereus sensu lato species affiliation reviewed
the distribution of the strains investigated in this study confirms the observation  <cit>  that many existing species affiliations do not match the genomic relationships . cluster iv contains mesophilic pathogenic b. cereus and b. thuringiensis and one b. weihenstephanensis strain. the presence of a unique cspa signature is described as being specific for psychrotolerant b. cereus sensu lato   <cit> , but the psychrotolerant cspa-signature could not be detected in b. weihenstephanensis fsl r5- <dig> . thus, this strain is likely incorrectly classified as b. weihenstephanensis. cluster iii comprises b. anthracis, emetic and non-emetic b. cereus and b. thuringiensis. while it is almost impossible to distinguish between cluster iii b. cereus and b. thuringiensis isolates , b. anthracis is an easily discernable monophyletic group in the species tree. in cluster ii potentially pathogenic psychrotolerant strains like b. cereus rivm bc  <dig>  <cit>  are found that are closely related to cluster iii.

however, three phylogenetic groups can be matched easily to three species. cluster v is clearly separated from all other phylogenetic groups and includes the type strain of the recently described species b. toyonensis bct- <dig> which differs from other b. cereus sensu lato type strains . all isolates belonging to the phylogenetic group v should be renamed as members of b. toyonensis  <cit> . both b. toyonensis bct- <dig> and the newly sequenced b. cereus ip <dig> are commercially available probiotics, toyocerin® and bactisubtil®  <cit> , respectively. thus, the almost clonally related bacillus strains of cluster v might also be feasible as probiotics for animal feeding but the distribution of enterotoxin genes  probably renders this species also a human pathogen. cluster i is constituted by b. pseudomycoides  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of housekeeping genes clustered b. mycoides rock3- <dig>  together with b. pseudomycoides dsm  <dig>  in cluster i. based on these data we suggest that this strain should be renamed as b. pseudomycoides after confirmation by fatty acid profiling. strains of clusters i and vii  show the greatest distance to all other members of b. cereus sensu lato.

occurrence of virulence genes
to gain an overview over the distribution of virulence genes,  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains, including our de novo sequenced strains, were analyzed . all b. cereus strains possess the nhe genes. we analyzed the presence of the toxin genes hbl, cytk and ces and found that  <dig> % of the  <dig> strains contained hbl and  <dig> % of these possess a second hbl operon. cytk- <dig> appears in  <dig> %, cytk- <dig> in  <dig> % and the emetic gene cluster ces in  <dig> % of all strains. cytk- <dig> is far more frequent in b. thuringiensis strains  than in the rest of b. cereus sensu lato . these results match a study from  <dig> that investigated  <dig> uncharacterized b. thuringiensis strains. all of them harbored the nhe genes,  <dig> % hbl and  <dig> % cytk- <dig>  displaying about the same potential to cause diarrhea as b. cereus  <cit> . the combined presence of nhe, hbl and cytk occurs more often among diarrheal  than among food-borne b. cereus sensu stricto strains   <cit> . we find that  <dig> % of the  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains contain all three enterotoxins.

evolution of hbl
massive horizontal transfer of hbl
hbl is not an essential operon, since only  <dig> % of  <dig> strains contain hbl, which appear rarely in cluster iii and are absent from b. cytotoxicus  . a comparison of the concatenated hblcdab gene tree with a species tree consisting of all  <dig> hbl-containing strains shows vastly different topologies . all phylogenetic clusters except cluster v are mixed which is evidence for massive horizontal transfer of the enterotoxin operon hblcdab, both between and within phylogenetic groups.

it has been speculated that hblcdab is part of a large  <dig> kb transposon  <cit> . a detailed comparison of putative transposon regions including hbl or hbla of the  <dig> hbl-containing strains sequenced de novo in this work is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  however, while half of the hbl operons are inserted within the uvrc gene as described earlier  <cit> , in the other strains neither insertion sites nor length of the inserted region or adjacent genes are conserved.

ancient origin of hblcda
phylogenetic trees represent the species evolution only if orthologous genes are compared which have not been transferred laterally. in contrast, paralogs result from gene duplications  <cit> . after several generations it becomes increasingly difficult to recognize paralogs, especially when gene loss is involved. it has been known that two distinct homologs of hbl exist in b. cereus  <cit> . the more abundant version of hblcdab occurs in  <dig> % while the second, truncated hbla operon  is present in  <dig> % of the investigated strains. six of the de novo sequenced and assembled strains contain two versions of hbl and/or nhe. we confirmed the existence of duplicated enterotoxin operons by comparison of coverage depths over operons and their respective background contigs as described in . the duplication of hblcdab as well as the subsequent loss of hblb must be an ancient and unique event which occurred early in the evolution of b. cereus sensu lato since all hblcdaa genes cluster together and are clearly separated from hblcda  despite the fact that they are scattered over five phylogenetic clusters. subsequently, hblcdaa appears to have been deleted in various lines of the species group . while hblcdab was subject to extensive horizontal gene transfer , hblcdaa seems to have been transferred vertically due to a much more conserved tree topology . it has been shown that hblb is not essential for enterotoxic activity, because hblcdab mrna synthesis appears to terminate within the hblb gene  <cit> , which might be a pseudogene  <cit> . hblcdaa is located on plasmid in the four strains b. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki ybt- <dig> , b. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki hd- <dig> , b. thuringiensis serovar chinensis ct- <dig>  and b. thuringiensis serovar thuringiensis is <dig> , but the detection of plasmid-location may increase with an ongoing completion of genomes.fig.  <dig>

functional constraints in the evolution of hbl
while horizontal transfer of the hblcdab operon is frequent, intra-operon recombinations are extremely rare. only five statistically significant recombination events within the set of  <dig> strains could be detected  and all of these occurred exclusively within their respective phylogenetic group. intra-operon recombinations between different phylogenetic groups have probably been removed by negative selection. dna sequence identities of hbl between b. cereus sensu lato strains are quite high . thus, hbl is more conserved than nhe or even housekeeping genes in b. cereus sensu lato . both, high sequence conservation and rare intra-operon recombination, suggest that the interaction between hbl components might be quite specific, thus constraining sequence variation. this assumption is supported by experimental studies of the interaction of hbl and hbla proteins. both operons encode a functional toxin. however, despite their high similarity, not all hbl/hbla components are exchangeable to form functional toxins  <cit> .

horizontal transfer of cytk
the third diarrhea causing agent is the single-component chromosomally encoded toxin cytk, which is a hemolytic, dermonecrotic and β-barrel pore-forming enterotoxin  <cit> . two variants of cytk are known.  <dig> % of the amino acid sequence of cytk- <dig> is identical to cytk- <dig> and cytk- <dig> is also able to form pores in planar lipid bilayers, but it shows only  <dig> % of cytk- <dig> toxicity  <cit> . the gene cytk- <dig> occurs in  <dig> % of the strainset and only the two b. cytotoxicus strains  possess cytk- <dig>  we detected cytk- <dig> in strains of clusters ii – v, which might have acquired this toxin gene via lateral transfer prior to splitting into clusters ii, iii and iv  from the b. cytotoxicus phylogenetic line where the cytk ancestor may have originated. it may have been lost subsequently in some strains of clusters ii and iii. in contrast, a recent horizontal transfer of cytk- <dig> to a few cluster v strains seems to have occurred . lateral transfer of cytk can also be inferred from a direct comparison of the cytk tree with the species tree of all  <dig> cytk-containing strains .

massive horizontal transfer and sequence variation of the virulence regulator plcr
the expression of many virulence factors in b. cereus is regulated by the pleiotropic transcriptional activator plcr   <cit> . the promoters of genes regulated by plcr show a highly conserved palindromic recognition site , which occurs in the promoter regions of nhe, hbl  <cit>  and cytk  <cit> . several other proteins were discovered that are under control of plcr, such as two-component sensors, chemotaxis proteins, transporters, cytoplasmic regulators and cell wall biogenesis proteins. this indicates that plcr is a global regulator and a key component in adaptation to  environment  <cit> . the gene phylogeny of plcr hints to lateral transfer within  <dig> b. cereus, b. anthracis and b. thuringiensis strains  <cit> . our comparison of the plcr gene phylogeny of  <dig> strains of all species of the b. cereus group  with the b. cereus sensu lato species tree  confirms a low degree of conservation of plcr  and a surprisingly low similarity of both trees. these grossly conflicting topologies may be a result of both frequent horizontal transfer and rapid divergent evolution of plcr driven by a variety of environmental selection pressures. the papr gene is encoded less than  <dig> bp downstream of plcr and shows a phylogeny highly similar to plcr . papr is the quorum sensing peptide necessary for activation plcr and part of the plcr regulon  <cit> . the genomes of b. pseudomycoides dsm  <dig> , b. mycoides rock3- <dig>  and b. mycoides rock1- <dig>  do not contain papr, which might cause reduced pathogenicity of cluster i strains.fig.  <dig>

plcr was experimentally inactivated in b. cereus and b. thuringiensis by a number of mutations  <cit>  including deletions, additions, nonsense mutations, high diversity, and mutations in papr or opp, genes necessary for plcr activation. inactivation of the plcr regulon and a subsequent non-hemolytic phenotype also occur naturally. in b. anthracis a nonsense mutation after  <dig> bp leads to a truncated protein, while in b. cereus biovar anthracis a c-terminal frameshift results in a four amino acids longer protein, both completely inactivate the plcr regulon  <cit> . the b. cereus biovar anthracis plcr mutation also occurs in b. cereus isp <dig> . c-terminal plcr gene extensions appear in b. cytotoxicus , b. pseudomycoides  and b. weihenstephanensis , but their function is yet unknown. the dna binding domain helix-turn-helix motif is located in the n-terminal part of the active protein, the regulatory domain in the c-terminal region  <cit> . the greatest sequence variation is found in the 3′ end of plcr . while binding to the recognition site requires a highly conserved protein structure, the regulatory function obviously tolerates a higher sequence variation. hence, this might be a way of allowing fast adaptation to changing environmental or host conditions by modulating transcriptional activation of specific plcr-controlled genes without unnecessary inactivation of the entire regulon.

evolution of nheabc enterotoxin genes
ancient origin of nhe and recent horizontal gene transfer of the nhe variant nhea
while no duplications of cytk or plcr could be found, a very rare second nheabc operon was noticed in four of the  <dig> b. cereus sensu lato strains investigated . two b. cereus strains  and two b. weihenstephanensis strains  possess a second nheabc variant which we term nhea. in b. weihenstephanensis kbab <dig>  the nhea operon is part of the  <dig> kb plasmid pbwb <dig>  the other three nhea copies could not be located on a similar plasmid, but were shown to be genuine duplications . the nhea operon contains all three nhe genes, is actively transcribed, albeit not in all strains , and we found a putative plcr recognition site upstream of nheaa . nhea operons differ greatly from all known nhe , including b. cytotoxicus’ nheabc that was until now considered the only major and most distantly related variant. nhea might have resulted from two relatively recent, but separate hgt events into two strains of clusters ii and vi, since cluster ii and cluster vi nhea are two clearly distinct variants. the donor strains harboring the two nhea versions have not yet been identified, but sequence comparison shows that their nhea must have separated very early in the evolution of the b. cereus group . apparently, the nhea operon is not stably integrated in the genome since several strains in both phylogenetic groups ii and vi seem to have lost it shortly after acquisition . nhea and hbla might be starting points for the evolution of new pore-forming enterotoxins in b. cereus sensu lato, analogous to the suspected development of hbl and nhe themselves from an ancient ancestor by gene duplication  <cit> .fig.  <dig>

strictly vertical transmission of nheabc
a phylogenetic tree of the concatenated nheabc genes was calculated  and compared with the mlsa species tree . surprisingly, their topology is almost identical. some strains contain more distantly related nhe sequences, such as b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides  or b. cytotoxicus nvh 391– <dig> with only 72– <dig> % dna sequence identity to other nhe operons  <cit>  . we suggest that no significant recombination of distantly related nhe operons has occurred. after discovering the strictly vertical transmission pattern of nheabc, recombination within the nhe operon was investigated in more detail. in the set of  <dig> concatenated nheabc genes  <dig> statistically proven intra-operon recombination events could be detected, but these occurred only between closely related nhe regions, which keeps recombination derived variation small . furthermore, and most significantly, nhe occurs in all known b. cereus strains without exception, which may be evidence for an important function of the operon. it is noticable that nhea is the most highly conserved gene of the nhe operon .

while nhe components and their interactions are currently analyzed extensively  all studies have been focused on the pore-forming activity. however, in nhea an enlarged β-tongue structure was found  <cit>  which, despite its similarity to clya and hblb, might be involved in a protein-protein interaction associated with an unknown function. if an unknown function exists, balancing selection may have resulted in a co-evolution of nhe with a  interacting factor. such an interaction would impose certain constraints on the nhea structure, allowing recombination between closely related nhe copies but leading to the observed absence of horizontal gene transfer between distantly related strains in order to prevent a fitness loss. we speculate that the strictly vertical evolution, the rare and unstable occurrence of nhe copies and high sequence conservation may be evidence for an additional function of nhe. while the existence of such a hypothetical function can be predicted based on our phylogenetic analysis, further experimental investigation certainly is necessary.

evolution of enterotoxin genes and risk assessment
while b. anthracis is considered non-enteropathogenic due to the deactivated plcr-regulon  <cit> , b. cereus and b. thuringiensis are known to be enterotoxic  <cit> . b. weihenstephanensis strains also carry enterotoxin genes. while this psychrotolerant species is not known to be involved in outbreaks – probably due to reduced toxicity at elevated temperatures  – it is listed as a risk level  <dig> organism in germany. the enterotoxicity of b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides is unknown, but our results and other studies confirm that nhe, hbl and cytk can be found in strains of both species  <cit> . b. toyonensis and other ‘probiotic’ b. cereus strains have been used as feed additive. however, their toxic potential is controversially discussed and some are not licensed in the eu . our results confirm the presence of nhe and hbl in probiotic strains b. toyonensis bct- <dig>  and b. cereus ip <dig> , as well as cytk in two other strains of the species. the pathogenicity of a b. cereus sensu lato strain is, most probably, influenced by additional virulence factors such as sphingomyelinase, hemolysin ii and metalloproteases . some b. toyonensis strains contain npra , sph  and inha  virulence genes. additional virulence factors can also be found in b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides strains. since hgt is wide-spread among b. cereus sensu lato, we consider it difficult to categorize a species of this group as non-pathogenic per se. the evolutionary analysis of pathogenicity factors may give reason to initiate a reconsideration of the current enteropathogenicity risk assessment strategies of the whole b. cereus group.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that seven concatenated housekeeping gene sequences depict species relationships in b. cereus sensu lato as accurately as whole-genome comparisons. many potentially probiotic b. cereus strains form a clearly distinguishable phylogenetic line within b. cereus sensu lato , which we propose to designate as b. toyonensis named according to the type strain. however, species affiliation of strains is contradictory in many cases. the phylogenetic analysis of this study, therefore, calls for a reassessment of this group’s taxonomy. lateral transfer of virulence genes hbl, cytk, nhe and plcr within b. cereus sensu lato appears to be constrained only by preservation of gene function, which leads us to hypothesize that the strictly vertical transmission of nhe operons is caused by a second, unknown but fitness relevant function of nhe. we note that evolution of the three b. cereus enterotoxin operons is shaped unexpectedly different. furthermore, ancient diversification of nhe and hbl operons and propagation of hbla suggest a potential to develop new enterotoxin variants. the distribution of pathogenicity factors and frequent recombination among b. cereus sensu lato phylogenetic groups should be taken into account during risk assessment of the currently valid species of this group, especially concerning probiotic b. toyonensis and b. mycoides strains.
