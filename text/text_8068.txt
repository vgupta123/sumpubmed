BACKGROUND
sexual dimorphism is a common phenomenon in humans and many non-human primate species, such as chimpanzees and rhesus macaques. it is exhibited in a variety of physical characteristics, such as body size, brain size, hair color and skeletal structure, as well as the central nervous system   <cit> . for cns, the most obvious sexual dimorphism is the size of the brain. among numerous primates, males have larger brains than females; in humans for example, on average the total brain volume of males is about 11 % larger than in females. similar differences also exist for regional brain volumes: total grey matter volume , and cerebellum volume  . brain size dimorphism is curiously prominent in apes and humans as well as in some old world monkey species such as macaques, but no brain size dimorphism is present in new world monkeys  or prosimians   <cit> . this disparity suggests that the origin of brain size dimorphism in primates is a relatively recent event, one that occurred after the split between old and new world monkeys about  <dig> million years ago. brain size dimorphism also exists in many non-primate mammalian species  <cit> , suggesting multiple origins of this phenomenon during evolution.

one of the hallmarks of primate evolution, and particularly the origin of humans, is an ever-increasing brain size. to date, most studies on brain evolution have focused on understanding the genetic basis of the between-species divergence of brain size among primates, especially between humans and non-human primates  <cit> . these studies have found a series of genes regulating brain size. in humans, truncated mutations of these genes would cause a rare human genetic disorder, primary microcephaly , which is characterized by a severe reduction of brain size as well as mild to severe cognitive impairment  <cit> . the genes purportedly related to mcph include brit1/mcph <dig> , wdr <dig>  , cdk5rap <dig>   <cit> , cep <dig>  <cit> , aspm  <cit> , cenpj  <cit> , and stil  <cit> . interestingly, all seven mcph genes encode centrosome or spindle pole proteins taking part in proper centrosome or mitotic microtubule organization  <cit> , indicating their important roles during neurogenesis. likewise, gene knockout mouse models of three mcph genes  all resulted in marked reduction in brain size .

of the seven identified mcph genes, four were previously shown to have undergone rapid evolution at the protein sequence level due to darwinian positive selection during primate evolution, suggesting that these genes contributed to the evolution of the primate brains, and by extension human brains  <cit> . among humans, previous studies showed that sequence variations in three of these mcph genes  are associated with brain size and structure, but in a sex dependent manner  <cit> , implying that mcph genes may be in some way regulated by sex hormones. if accurate, it stands to reason that the sex-dependent differences in the expression of these genes may contribute to the sexual dimorphism in the brain sizes observed among humans and certain nonhuman primates. although no reliable data is available to indicate the assumed difference of sex hormone levels in the brain between males and females, it was reported in humans that puberty time  plays an important role in shaping up the difference in brain development between males and females . unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms that would explain this effect are still unknown.

estrogen is known to be a key regulator of development of female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics, but it also plays a role in neural functions by engaging in signaling on synaptic proteins, connectivity and synaptic function  <cit> . it has three forms, including estradiol, estriol and estrone, among which estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. the estrogen receptor  is a member of the steroid/nuclear receptor super-family of transcription factors that is required for mediating estrogen-induced responses  <cit> . while a large number of genes can be regulated by estrogen  <cit> , it has never been tested whether mcph genes are direct targets of estrogen. in this study, we investigated the regulation of estradiol on the seven mcph genes, and found that four of them  can be regulated by estradiol. we then examined the effects of estradiol on the promoter activity of these four mcph genes and found that estradiol is capable of suppressing the promoter activities of these mcph genes in both humans and nonhuman primates, and moreover that this suppression mechanism may contribute to the differential development and sexual dimorphic size differences observed between the male and female primate brains.

RESULTS
identification of estrogen responsive elements in four microcephaly genes
to determine whether estradiol could regulate the seven currently known microcephaly genes , we conducted a search of the potential ere  sites in gene promoter regions. four genes  contain predicted half ere sites  in their promoters   <cit> . in total, there are two predicted half ere sites in aspm , six in cdk5rap <dig> , three in mcph <dig>  and two in wdr <dig> . sequence alignments of the promoter regions of representative primate species and mouse indicated that the predicted half ere sites are, in general, conserved among human and nonhuman primates , implying functional constraints on these half ere sites. however, for aspm and mcph <dig>   <dig> out of the  <dig> half ere sites are not conserved in marmosets .fig.  <dig> identification of half eres in the mcph gene promoter sequences. the half eres were mapped based on the gene’s translational start site



to test whether the predicted half ere sites are functional, we cloned the promoters of the four genes  into luciferase vectors and then assayed their capacity of modulating promoter activity in response to estradiol treatment of the transfected hek293t cells. the 17-β-estradiol  was used. we found that e <dig>  could regulate the promoter activities of all four microcephaly genes, significantly repressing the promoter activities with the presence of erα . on average, the down-regulation levels of the four mcph genes were 39 % for mcph <dig>  43 % for wdr <dig>  19 % for aspm and 23 % for cdk5rap <dig>  we further tested different e <dig> dosages , and the results remained the same .fig.  <dig> e <dig> represses the promoter activities of four mcph genes. a quantification of repressive activity of aspm gene and the aspm- <dig> and aspm- <dig> deletion mutants using luciferase reporter gene assay. b quantification of repressive activity with deletion mutations of half ere sequence at − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> - <dig> - <dig> and − <dig> upstream of the cdk5rap <dig> translation start site and cdk5rap <dig> gene using luciferase reporter gene assay. c quantification of repressive activity with deletion mutations of half ere sequence at − <dig>  − <dig> and − <dig> upstream of the mcph <dig> translation start site and also mcph <dig> gene, using luciferase reporter gene assay. d quantification of repressive activity with deletion mutations of half ere sequence at − <dig> and − <dig> upstream of the wdr <dig> translation start site and wdr <dig> gene using luciferase reporter gene assay. the hek293t cells were transiently transfected with vector containing human erα



functional validation of half eres using mutant assays
in order to clarify whether e2’s regulation on the mcph genes is mediated by direct interaction between e <dig> and the predicted half ere sites, we designed a mutant assay by deleting the half ere sites in the promoters. for aspm, when either of the two half ere sites was deleted, the repressive effect disappeared , indicating that the two half ere sites are necessary for aspm’s response to e2’s regulation. similarly, for cdk5rap <dig>  among the six half ere sites, three showed loss of the repressive effects but the other three did not , while one of the two half ere sites for wdr <dig> appeared to be necessary for e2’s regulation . taken collectively, the mutant assay demonstrated that the regulation of e <dig> on the four mcph genes is mediated by interaction with the half ere sites. interestingly, we did not observe a graded phenotype of the loss of repression in the mutant assays, an implication of a possible cooperative effect among the half ere sites.

e <dig> represses endogenous mcph gene expression
given the observed repression of the promoter activities of the four mcph genes in the reporter gene assays, we tested the effects of e <dig> on endogenous gene expression. the hek293t cells capable of expressing estrogen receptors  <cit>  were used to quantify mrna expression of the four mcph genes under e <dig> treatments . the results showed that all four mcph genes were down-regulated endogenously in the hek293t cells following e <dig> treatments of 24 h  . the same effect was also seen in the e <dig> treated mcf <dig> cells and k <dig> cells  . additionally, time course analysis using k <dig> cells revealed the same pattern , suggesting that e <dig> can repress the promoter activity of the four mcph genes.fig.  <dig> endogenous mcph gene expression measurement in human cells treated by e <dig>  a-c quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  measure effects of e <dig> deprivation  and e <dig>  on endogenous aspm, cdk5rap <dig> mcph <dig> gene expression in hek <dig>  mcf <dig> and k <dig> cells, normalized to actin. aspm, cdk5rap <dig>  mcph <dig> and wdr <dig> gene expression levels in e2-deprived cells were set as a level of 1-fold expression level. d aspm, cdk5rap <dig>  mcph <dig> and wdr <dig> mrna were determined by real-time quantitative pcr in k <dig> cell lines . the promoter activity was measured as the ratio of luciferase activity, which was normalized by setting the value of the control  as  <dig>  all histograms represent the mean ± sd of at least three independent experiments, and each experiment contains three repeats. 



interspecific comparison of e2’s repressing effects in different primate species
to test if the observed e <dig> regulation of the mcph genes is conserved across other primate species, we cloned the promoters of the four mcph genes from chimpanzees and macaques  and tested their response to e <dig> treatments. similar to the results of the human genes, promoters from all four mcph genes in both chimpanzees and macaques showed repressed activity under e <dig> treatments , with the exception of a non-significant repression of the macaque aspm promoter .

furthermore, we used a neural cell line  and tested all four primate species including marmosets. we observed a similar pattern, in which the repression effects are conserved across humans, chimpanzees and macaques that are known to exhibit sexual dimorphism . in marmosets, wdr <dig> and cdk5rap <dig> also showed the repression effects , but aspm and mcph <dig> did not  because their half ere sites are not conserved in marmosets . this observation is consistent with the fact that marmosets do not have brain sexual dimorphism  <cit> .fig.  <dig> e <dig> suppresses the promoter activities of mcph genes in sk-n-sh cells. a-d quantification of promoter activity of aspm, cdk5rap <dig>  mcph <dig> and wdr <dig> using luciferase reporter gene assay. the sk-n-sh cells  were transiently transfected with vector containing human erα



between-sex gene expression comparison in the human brain
to trace the dynamic change of expression of the mcph genes during brain development, we used currently published human brain transcriptome data  to construct the expression curve of each mcph gene . the results showed that there might be potential expression differences between males and females for mcph <dig> and cdk5rap <dig> . further investigation of these genes, particularly mcph <dig> and cdk5rap <dig> are warranted.

discussion
estrogen is well known to influence numerous sexual dimorphic traits in both humans and several other primates, but its role in brain development has never been clearly articulated. previous association analysis in humans indicated that three of the brain size regulating genes  contain sequence variations significantly associated with brain size, but more provocatively that the associations are sex-dependent  <cit> , suggesting that sex hormones may be involved in the regulation of mcph genes, and by extension brain size. among the seven mcph genes, four contain half ere sites in their promoters. interestingly, these half ere sites are generally conserved in those primates exhibiting sexual dimorphism, suggesting they play functional roles in these species, including in humans. both the reporter gene assay and endogenous expression analysis showed that e <dig> was able to suppress the expression of these four mcph genes, implying a potentially novel role of estradiol in the observed differences in male and female brain sizes among primates. the mutant assay indicated that the repressive effect of e <dig> was mediated by its direct interaction with the predicted half ere sites. given these results, it is likely that a majority of the currently known brain size regulating genes  in primates is regulated by estradiol, providing a potential molecular mechanism that explains brain size dimorphism in humans and nonhuman primates.

the four tested mcph genes are all expressed in the neuroepithelium during fetal development and encode proteins that influence proliferation of neurons in the ventricular zone of the developing brain  <cit> . hence, it is likely that the sex difference is established early in development because the size of the neural progenitor pool determines brain size during fetal brain development  <cit> . a previous report showed that sex-related differences in brain structure are determined mainly by the hormonal environment present during embryonic development  <cit> . using published rnaseq data of human fetal brains , we found a large number of differentially expressed genes  between males and females. in constrast, there are only  <dig> such genes in the adult brains with little overlap  with those in the fetal brains  <cit>  , supporting the speculated early establishment of sex difference in brain development. additionally, puberty time also plays an important role in postnatal brain development  <cit> . it was shown that mean volume of the medial temporal lobe increases in adolescent boys but decreases in adolescent girls with the progression of puberty  <cit> .

also, it was traditionally argued that females reach puberty earlier than males, therefore, would withdraw earlier from somatic development. our findings suggest that the female hormone estrogen may serve as one of the key factors causing the between-sex difference of the brain.

a recent study indicated that the sequence evolution of mcph <dig> is associated with the evolution of sex dimorphism of anthropoid brain mass  <cit> . consistently, in humans, mcph <dig> shows a potential between-sex expression divergence at two developmental stages   when the levels of estradiol are presumably higher in females than in males. a similar pattern was also seen in cdk5rap <dig> during adulthood . however, these potential differences need further tests. no between-sex difference was detected for the other two mcph genes  . the difference in effect of estradiol suggests that regulation on the mcph genes by estradiol is likely dependent on spatial-temporal interactions between estradiol and its targets during brain development, though again, more targeted follow-up studies may prove useful in clarifying this possibility. given the proposed role of mcph <dig> in brain size dimorphism, this may explain why new world monkeys like the common marmoset do not exhibit brain size dimorphism  <cit>  because two of the three half ere sites of mcph <dig> are not conserved in the common marmoset , and no repression effect by estradiol was detected .

to date, molecular evolution studies have found that four of the seven known mcph genes—aspm, cdk5rap <dig>  cenpj and mcph1—evolved rapidly in primates due to darwinian positive selection, which is associated with the enlargement of the brain during primate evolution and human origin  <cit> . for example, the signal of positive selection on mcph <dig> was previously inferred in the common ancestor of great apes and humans as well as in the human lineage  <cit> . surprisingly, the results of our study here found that three of these fast-evolving mcph genes overlapped with the four mcph genes under estradiol regulation, suggesting that natural selection may favor parallel changes of both brain size change and brain size dimorphism. this fits quite well with what we already know, that estradiol is essential for brain development and it can promote neurite growth and regulate synaptic patterning  <cit> . ultimately then, when natural selection pushes the enlargement of the brain, it may be that it tends to act on genes already under estradiol regulation, and our results suggest that it does so potentially by suppressing the expression of brain size related genes in females  <cit> .

it should be noted that besides the mcph genes tested in this study, there might be other mcph genes or unknown regulatory factors contributing to brain sexual dimorphism in primates. for example, the male sex hormone  may play a role in brain sexual dimorphism. also, why natural selection would favor a relatively smaller brain size in females is not clear. one possible explanation is the differential social roles of males and females that would lead to differential selective pressures during evolution. more evidence needs to be collected to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that estrogen could down-regulate four of the known brain size regulating genes. this suppression effect may contribute to between-sex difference in brain size in humans and nonhuman primates with brain sexual dimorphism, suggesting that sex hormones may play an important role in primate brain evolution.
