BACKGROUND
the tumor suppressor p <dig> mediates the cellular response to dna damage by triggering cell cycle arrest and dna repair or by evoking cellular senescence and apoptosis
 <cit> . these functions of p <dig> are essential for preserving genomic integrity and preventing neoplastic transformation. loss of p <dig> activity, either by functional inactivation of its pathway or by gene mutation, is a frequent event in the onset and progression of many human malignancies
 <cit> . p <dig> function is also critical to the efficacy of cancer therapies that generate dna damage, such as radiation and chemotherapy, and defects in p <dig> are often associated with therapy resistance
 <cit> .

within cells, levels of p <dig> protein are tightly controlled by several regulatory feedback loops that direct its stability and degradation. one major regulator of p <dig> is the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase mdm <dig>  p <dig> transcriptionally activates mdm <dig> expression and mdm <dig> targets p <dig> for degradation by the proteasome
 <cit> . this interaction keeps p <dig> levels low under unstressed conditions. in response to cellular stress, p <dig> is activated through upstream kinases that induce post-translational modifications and disrupt the p53-mdm <dig> interaction, allowing p <dig> to accumulate in the nucleus and induce the expression of target genes that mediate the cellular stress response
 <cit> .

dna double strand breaks  are particularly dangerous lesions for metazoan cells, as they can promote tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal translocations and genomic instability upon misrepair
 <cit> . a complex molecular machinery recognizes the presence of free dna ends and induces the rapid activation of the kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated 
 <cit>  . among the substrates of atm is the histone variant h2ax, which is phosphorylated around the break site and serves as a binding platform for mediator proteins that propagate the dna damage signal.

activated atm subsequently phosphorylates and stabilizes p <dig>  which shows a series of highly regulated, undamped pulses in single cells upon induction of dsbs. the amplitude and duration of p <dig> pulses is independent of the damage dose, whereas the number of pulses increases with higher damage
 <cit> . these dynamics are a consequence of the feedback architecture of the p <dig> network. in addition to the p53-mdm <dig> feedback, a second feedback mediated by the phosphatase wip <dig> leads to periodic inactivation of atm after a pulse of p <dig> accumulation
 <cit> . this allows cells to evaluate the state of their genome and re-initiate the response if damage persists
 <cit> . moreover, p <dig> pulses after dsb induction are excitable: a complete p <dig> pulse of uniform amplitude and duration is induced independent of the strength of the damage signal
 <cit> . several theoretical studies have suggested potential physiological roles for p <dig> pulses
 <cit> . recently we have shown that, indeed, the dynamical behavior of p <dig> carries information that controls cell fate. cells that experience p <dig> pulses undergo temporary cell cycle arrest and recover from the damage, while cells in which p <dig> shows a non-oscillatory, sustained response undergo apoptosis or senescence
 <cit> .

although much insight has been gained into the molecular mechanisms that regulate p <dig> pulses in response to dsbs
 <cit>  and their functional role
 <cit> , little is known about the quantitative relationship of dna damage and p <dig> induction. specifically, is there a fixed threshold of damage that is necessary for activating a p <dig> response? western blot analysis of atm phosphorylation in irradiated cells suggested that atm is activated in a highly sensitive manner. damage doses estimated to generate one or two dsbs were sufficient for a partial activation of atm, and doses that generated more than twenty dsbs evoked a complete atm response
 <cit> . similarly, it was shown that cells are released from an atm-mediated g <dig> checkpoint when less than approximately  <dig> dsbs remain
 <cit> . the sensitivity of the p <dig> pathway was measured by introducing serial dilutions of restriction enzymes or linearized double-stranded dna molecules into cells that were subsequently assayed for p <dig> function. from these studies, it was estimated that a solitary dsb might suffice to activate a p <dig> response
 <cit> .

however, measurements in previous studies averaged over populations of cells or estimated dynamics from fixed cells. remarkably, identical cells in a uniformly damaged population exhibit a large heterogeneity in their p <dig> response, with cells showing a variable number of pulses
 <cit> . it is conceivable that this variation arises from differences in the cells’ number of breaks or rates of repair. to gain a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the number of dsbs and p <dig> activation and to investigate the cause of heterogeneity in the p <dig> response, we established a cellular system that expresses fluorescent reporters to quantify both dna damage and p <dig> dynamics in the same living cell.

RESULTS
quantification of dsbs and their rate of repair in individual living cells
to quantify dna dsbs in single cells, we used a fluorescent reporter system based on the mediator protein 53bp <dig> . 53bp <dig> localizes to chromatin regions adjacent to dsbs within minutes after damage and forms foci that are discernable by light microscopy. these foci can serve as markers for the number and location of dsbs
 <cit> . we established a clonal human mcf <dig> breast carcinoma cell line that stably expresses mouse 53bp <dig> fused to the fluorescent protein mcherry and verified that 53bp <dig> foci co-localize with the canonical marker for dsbs, γ-h2ax . to follow the dynamics of dsbs over time, we performed live-cell time-lapse microscopy of reporter cells after treatment with ionizing radiation . using optical sectioning, deconvolution and automated image analysis, we quantified the number of 53bp <dig> foci at regular intervals  for a period of  <dig> hours post-irradiation . our analysis showed that the number of 53bp1-mcherry foci in a cell decreases with time. the decay in the number of foci was fitted to an exponential model  and the half-life of 53bp <dig> foci was calculated for each cell
 <cit> . we found that individual cells in a uniformly irradiated population acquire different initial numbers of 53bp <dig> foci  and vary in their kinetics of repair . note that the main cellular outcome following dsbs is g <dig> and g <dig> arrest and not apoptosis, even in response to high levels of damage .

to validate that the decay in the number of foci represents repair , we confirmed that the distribution of the number of foci at  <dig> hours post irradiation is similar between cells that were imaged frequently  and cells that were imaged only at  <dig> hours post irradiation . in addition, we treated cells with a specific small molecule inhibitor of dna-pk 
 <cit> . this abrogated dna repair by non-homologous end joining and led to a slower disappearance of foci, as dna damage can be repaired only by homologous recombination in the presence of this drug . taken together, our results show a large heterogeneity in the induction and repair of dna damage in identical cells exposed to the same damage dose.

determining the quantitative relationship between dsbs and activation of p53
induction of dna damage leads to activation of the p <dig> network. to quantify the dynamics of p <dig> accumulation in single cells, we used a fluorescent reporter of p <dig> . in previous studies, we have shown that the p53-venus fusion protein faithfully reports the dynamics of endogenous p <dig> in mcf <dig> cells
 <cit> : high doses of ionizing radiation induce a series of uniform p <dig> pulses . mcf <dig> cells harbor an amplification of the ppm1d/wip <dig> gene locus and express relatively high levels of the phosphatase wip <dig>  potentially affecting p <dig> dynamics
 <cit> . to ensure that p <dig> pulses are not limited to cells with high levels of wip <dig>  we established our fluorescent p <dig> reporter system in a <dig> lung cancer cells and immortalized non-cancerous rpe <dig> cells and followed p <dig> dynamics post-damage . in both cell lines, we detected p <dig> pulses similar to mcf <dig> cells. moreover, p <dig> pulses have been previously reported in additional cell lines and in vivo using a p <dig> reporter in mice
 <cit> , suggesting that p <dig> pulses are not limited to the mcf <dig> cancer line, but represent a general cellular response to dsbs.

our quantification of dsbs in individual cells showed a large heterogeneity in the induction and rate of repair between cells exposed to the same damage dose . is there a comparable heterogeneity in the p <dig> response? to test this, we treated cells with varying doses of the radiomimetic drug neocarcinostatin  and quantified the number of p <dig> pulses. as previously reported, higher levels of damage led on average to higher numbers of p <dig> pulses. however, even at high damage doses, cells showed a large variability in the p <dig> response .

we, therefore, asked whether the variability in the p <dig> response can be explained by the heterogeneity in the induction and repair of dbss. to quantify the relationship between p <dig> pulses and dsbs we added the p53-venus reporter to cells expressing the 53bp1-mcherry reporter . we also added a fluorescent reporter for histone h2b  for obtaining a uniform nuclear signal that can aid with the automated segmentation of nuclei. we then treated cells with ionizing radiation and quantified the dynamics of dsb repair and p <dig> accumulation in individual cells over a time period of  <dig> hours . we found that all cells show active repair. however, many cells still had residual breaks even  <dig> hours after irradiation. as expected, these cells show a continuous series of p <dig> pulses . we also observed cells that apparently repaired all damage by  <dig> hours post irradiation. surprisingly, these cells showed a heterogeneous p <dig> response: some cells continued to show p <dig> pulses , while in others, p <dig> returned to its basal level once repair was complete . the variability in the number of p <dig> pulses was only poorly correlated with the initial number of breaks post damage .

to analyze in more detail the relationship between dna damage and the induction of a new p <dig> pulse during the repair process, we quantified the number of dsbs after a p <dig> pulse in each individual cell and correlated it with the presence or absence of a subsequent pulse in the expected time frame . we found that cells showing a subsequent p <dig> pulse tended to have higher levels of dna damage . however, the distributions of retained damage between cells that showed a subsequent p <dig> pulse and cells that did not were broadly overlapping, and we were unable to observe a fixed threshold number of dsbs that determine whether p <dig> will pulse or not.

as we were unable to determine a fixed threshold of dsbs for the induction of p <dig> pulses during repair, we used an alternative approach: we generated a distribution of induced dsbs by treating cells with a range of low ncs doses and correlated the amount of damage to the induction of a p <dig> response . using ncs instead of ionizing radiation allowed us to treat cells directly on the microscope and quantify dsbs before and immediately after damage without a significant time delay in image acquisition. moreover, we were able to finely titrate the amount of damaging agent to preferentially generate low numbers of dsbs, close to the previously suggested threshold levels
 <cit> . we have previously shown that the kinetics of dsb repair following ncs treatment are similar to those observed after γ-irradiation
 <cit> .

to analyze the relationship between dna breaks and the induction of p <dig>  we measured the number of dsbs and p <dig> pulses in more than  <dig> cells post dna damage. cells were binned according to the number of dsbs, and the fraction of cells that induced a p <dig> pulse in each bin was plotted . we expected to see a clear distinction between non-responding and responding cells at a defined threshold level of dsbs. surprisingly, what we observed instead was a linear relationship between dna damage and the p <dig> response: with higher amounts of damage, the fraction of cells responding with a p <dig> pulse increased continuously. this observation suggested that the amount of dna damage in each cell determines the probability of activating a p <dig> response. for intermediate levels of breaks the p <dig> response is heterogeneous between cells; for example, only about 50% of cells with  <dig> breaks show a p <dig> pulse.

the decision to activate a p <dig> pulse depends on previous exposure to dna damage and additional cell-intrinsic factors
previous single cell studies have shown that heterogeneity in cellular behavior can be based on different phenomena
 <cit> ; some cellular processes behave as stochastic systems based on the random fluctuations of their molecular components . other processes are influenced by the cellular state, for example cell cycle phase
 <cit> . to test whether the decision to activate a p <dig> pulse at intermediate amounts of dsbs is entirely stochastic, we treated cells with an initial low dose of damage and after six hours re-damaged them with the same damage dose . we first compared the fraction of cells showing a p <dig> pulse  in response to the first ncs treatment with the fraction of cells showing a pulse  after the second ncs treatment . surprisingly, we found fewer cells showing a pulse in response to the second treatment . moreover, the fraction of cells showing a pulse after the second treatment  did not exceed the fraction of cells showing a second p <dig> pulse in response to only one treatment , although the dna damage was largely repaired at this point . this suggests that during the first phase of the response  the p <dig> pathway does not reset and becomes desensitized to a second treatment. a similar behavior was recently reported for the activation of nfκb in response to repeated treatments of tnfα
 <cit> . we next asked whether the cells that do show a pulse after the second treatment are also the ones that showed a pulse after the first treatment. our analysis revealed that the probability of showing a second pulse was higher in cells that reacted upon the first stimulus . taken together our analysis shows that the generation of a p <dig> pulse in response to a distinct number of dsbs is not entirely stochastic; it is affected by previous exposure to stress and may be influenced by additional internal cell-specific factors.

which internal cellular factors may affect the decision to pulse or not?
we tested three cellular processes that could potentially influence the sensitivity of the p <dig> response: rate of dna repair, the level of p <dig> itself and the cell cycle phase. first, we tested if the induction of p <dig> pulses is influenced by the activity of the cellular dna repair machinery, which is reflected in the kinetics of repair. cells that achieve rapid recognition and repair of dsbs may not initiate a p <dig> pulse in response to damage, while cells that are slower in their response to dna dsbs may activate p <dig> to induce cell-cycle arrest and allow additional time for repair. to test this hypothesis, we plotted the fraction of cells inducing a p <dig> pulse binned according to their half-lives of dsbs . the lack of correlation between the rates of repair and the probability of activating p <dig> post damage indicates independence of the p <dig> response from the efficiency of the repair machinery.

we previously showed that p <dig> is frequently activated in proliferating cells
 <cit> . as these spontaneous pulses of p <dig> activate negative feedback mechanisms, the sensitivity of the p <dig> network may depend on its previous activation state. indeed, we saw here that previous exposure to dna damage desensitizes the p <dig> response . we, therefore, analyzed whether p <dig> absolute levels pre-damage influence the activation of p <dig> pulses post-damage. we found that cells with high initial p <dig> levels prior to ncs tended to have a lower probability of inducing a p <dig> pulse post-damage . however, the limited correlation between both parameters indicates that basal p <dig> levels per se are not a good predictor for the subsequent p <dig> response. note that since p <dig> initial levels were determined by measuring a single time point prior to ncs, cells with low levels of p <dig> might have just completed a p <dig> pulse and may still be in a desensitized state.

finally, we tested if activation of p <dig> post-damage is determined by the cell cycle phase
 <cit> . it is possible that cells in different cell cycle phases vary in their sensitivity to dna damage and have distinct thresholds of dsbs necessary for activating p <dig>  to investigate this, we imaged damaged cells to quantify the dynamics of their dsb repair and p <dig> activation. we then calculated the cell cycle phase of the imaged cells by measuring their dna content using diamidino-2-phenylindole  staining . we found that cells that induce a p <dig> pulse and cells that do not activate a p <dig> response had similar cell cycle distributions . to explore if different cell cycle phases vary in the threshold number of dsbs required to induce p <dig>  we binned cells according to their initial numbers of dsbs and plotted both the fraction of cells inducing a p <dig> pulse and the proportion of s/g <dig> cells for each bin . we found a uniform proportion of s/g <dig> cells across all bins indicating that cells in different cell cycle phases do not differ in their thresholds for activating a p <dig> pulse.

discussion
our data indicate a linear relationship between the amount of dsbs in a cell and the probability that p <dig> will pulse. however, even for a fixed number of breaks, some cells show a pulse and others do not. such heterogeneity in the response of individual cells has been frequently observed in other biological systems. for example, in response to low doses of the tumor necrosis factor, tnfα, nuclear localization of the transcription factor nfκb is only observed in a few cells. with higher doses of tnfα, more and more cells respond to the input
 <cit> . while the factors responsible for cell-cell variability were successfully identified for some biological systems
 <cit> , in many cases the origin of heterogeneous cellular responses remains elusive.

one potential cause of heterogeneity between cells in the cellular response is that cells receive varying amounts of input, for example, ligands or drugs. here, we directly measure the input each cell receives by enumerating the number of dsb. however, we found large variations in the induction of p <dig> even between cells that have similar numbers of dsbs, suggesting that it is not the level of dsb per se that explains the cell-cell variability in the decision to activate a p <dig> pulse.

by looking at the same cell in response to two rounds of dna damage we showed that the p <dig> pathway does not reset after the response to the first stimulus, even when most of the damage is repaired. this indicates that the decision to activate a p <dig> pulse is affected by previous exposure to damage. in addition, the probability to show a second pulse was higher in cells that also had a pulse in response to the first stimulus suggesting that the decision whether to activate p <dig> in response to low amounts of dsbs is not entirely stochastic, but is likely affected by the internal state of individual cells. although our analysis of the three cellular processes most likely to affect the sensitivity of the p <dig> network  did not reveal a major influence, there are other factors that may contribute to setting individual thresholds for p <dig> activation. such factors might include the expression of key proteins that regulate p <dig>  such as the negative regulator mdm <dig>  the stimulus provided by dsbs may not be sufficient to initiate a p <dig> pulse in cells that express high levels of mdm <dig>  interestingly, it was recently reported that tumor growth factor β  signaling attenuates the p53-mediated stress response
 <cit> . other signaling pathways may interact with p <dig> as well. using our experimental system, it would now be feasible to alter the signal state of cells systematically and determine the sensitivity of the p <dig> response.

our analyses showed that some cells do not activate p <dig> even at high levels of dna damage. one possibility for this observation is that the induction of p <dig> in response to dsbs is highly deregulated in cancer cells. it will be important to determine if normal, non-transformed cells are more uniform in their p <dig> response and show activation of p <dig> at a low number of dsbs. similar investigations carried out in multiple tumor cell lines will enable an understanding of their potential to uniformly induce p <dig> in response to dna damage and will provide insights into their sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapeutic treatments.

in this work we looked at the relationship between dsb and p <dig> induction, and the variation between cells, in an unperturbed system. one question that arises from our study is whether this relationship can be altered when dna repair is inhibited. this is especially important as major pharmaceutical companies have begun significant projects attempting to inhibit specific proteins in dna repair pathways, with the goal of using dna repair inhibitors in combination with dna-damaging treatments to prevent repair and trigger death or cell cycle arrest. the same question can be asked in the opposite direction – how does perturbation of p <dig> dynamics affect the rate of repair? recent studies from our group and others have shown that the dynamical behavior of p <dig> encodes critical cell-fate decisions
 <cit> ; hence, understanding how perturbations of p <dig> and key repair proteins will provide new and important insights for the treatment of tumors with different genetic profiles and repair deficiencies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we combined a reporter for dsbs with a fluorescent reporter for p <dig> and quantified the level of damage and the dynamics of p <dig> in the same, living cell. we found a linear correlation between the number of dsbs and the probability for activating a p <dig> pulse; more dsbs increase the probability that a cell will have a p <dig> pulse. however, there was no distinct threshold of damage for inducing a p <dig> response. by re-damaging cells we showed that the decision to activate p <dig> is not entirely stochastic but is determined by both previous exposure to dna damage and additional internal cell-specific factors. however, cell cycle phase, the initial levels of p <dig> and the rate of repair are not major determinants of this decision. the use of fluorescent reporters to quantify dna damage and p <dig> levels in live cells now presents powerful tools for providing an integrated quantitative understanding of their complex interrelationships in normal and cancerous cells.
