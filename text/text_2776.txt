BACKGROUND
the banana , including sweet and cooking bananas, is the number one tropical fruit, with a global production exceeding  <dig> million tons in  <dig>  it is also a staple food for more than  <dig> million people  <cit> . largely due to technological requirements for transportation and agronomic performances, 45% of world consumption relies on a single genotype , which is susceptible to the main musa diseases  <cit> . it is therefore urgent to breed new, disease-resistant genotypes that can be cultivated with less pesticide.

musa is a monocot with four known genomes  and a relatively small genome size of 500- <dig> mb in its haploid state. two species, m. acuminata  and m. balbisiana genomes  participate to most edible triploid bananas and contain an a and b genome, respectively.

musa textilis from australimusa section  and m. schizocarpa , carrying t and s genomes respectively, are involved in few edible cultivars <cit> . cultivated triploid clones  are difficult to cross because of sterility, polyploidy, high heterozygosity, interspecificity and low gamete fertility, thus limiting banana improvement  <cit> . sterility is generally associated to genome structural heterozygosity. these structural differences likely contribute to crossing barriers within the species. consequently, the musa acuminata complex has been divided into seven "translocation groups"  <cit> .

the most widely distributed type is designated the "standard" or "central" group, because of its broad distribution in the m. acuminata species and in other musa species  <cit> . in m. acuminata, microcarpa subsp., banksii subsp. and most malaccensis subsp. share this structure. the other six groups  are defined on the basis of chromosome pairing during meiosis. within each group, wild accessions share the same chromosome structure and are structural homozygotes, in contrast to most cultivated accessions. in previous characterizations, the inversions were not likened to "translocations", even if chromosome segment inversions was suspected  <cit> . the fertility of all cultivars is altered by their structural heterozygosity and sterility increases with the number of rearrangements/structural differences  <cit> .

despite the importance of a well established genetic map to sustain banana genetic improvement at diploid and triploid levels, this tool is presently lacking because of difficulties with musa in developing a mapping population free of any structural rearrangement. the previous efforts  <cit>  highlighted the likely presence of rearrangements but did not provide an interpretation in terms of the structure of the affected chromosomes.

the first mapping experiment with musa produced a non-saturated genetic map  <cit> , which exhibited  <dig> linkage groups with  <dig> markers, among which 36% significantly deviated from mendelian segregation . in that study, the f <dig> parent, selfed to generate the segregating progeny, was shown to be heterozygous for two reciprocal translocations. the second map was drawn from  <dig> individuals coming from a selfed m. acuminata diploid "m53". it displayed  <dig> linkage groups and also distorted markers  <cit> . the third map featured  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> ; 59% of the  <dig> markers were skewed  and the f <dig> hybrid used to generate the f <dig> population carried at least two translocations, if not three. pseudo-linkages could have led to the establishment of oversized linkage groups comprising distorted markers supposed to be involved in the structural rearrangements  <cit> .

a fourth map was to generate a refined m. acuminata parental map that could serve as a dense reference musa genetic map containing the  <dig> expected linkage groups. mapping was performed using a f <dig> population of diploid musa acuminata genotypes. the female parent was the wild m. acuminata 'borneo', subsp. microcarpa, supposed to be a structural homozygous. the male parent was the cultivar m. acuminata 'pisang lilin', subsp. malaccensis, exhibiting a northern malayan/standard heterozygous chromosomic structure  <cit> . therefore, the structural heterozygosity of the progeny, named borli population, should be limited to a unique rearrangement. this work was enabled by combining methodological approaches  with analytical approaches  to determine the structure or large chromosomal rearrangements and their location in the genetic maps of the parents of the population.

RESULTS
meiotic configuration
like many banana cultivars, the male parent m. acuminata 'p. lilin' contained structural chromosome rearrangements, while the wild female parent m. acuminata borneo, is supposed to be free of any.

meiotic preparations of borneo and p. lilin were analyzed. they both displayed some pollen mother cells  with normal chromosome pairing forming  <dig> bivalents  and some pmcs showing some degree of multivalent pairing. borneo showed one cell displaying one trivalent and one tetravalent , one cell displaying one pentavalent  and one cell displaying a hexavalent . on this basis, we infer that borneo has at least two structural polymorphisms linking three pairs of chromosomes. this was not expected because borneo, which is a seeded wild accession with good male and female fertility, was described as structurally homozygous  <cit> .

i: monovalent - ii: bivalent -- iii: trivalent -- iv: tetravalent -- v: pentavalent -- vi: hexavalent.

*: iv open x shape; ** iv open y shape. pmc: pollen mother cells

meiotic configurations of the p. lilin parent revealed less complex features. the presence of various cells with only one trivalent  as well as one cell showing an open tetravalent  led us to tentatively assume one structural polymorphism in p. lilin. in addition, the bridge observed in one pmc at anaphase-i  suggested the presence of one chromosome fragment inversion. it is noteworthy that no "closed tetravalent" was observed in these preparations. therefore, it is not possible to establish the presence of a true translocation across chromosomes. the meiosis observations on p. lilin are consistent with previous work  <cit>  on this same clone that also drew the conclusion of an inversion.

marker polymorphism
ssr markers
the ssr marker polymorphism in parents was tested for the  <dig> primer pairs selected . two hundred and fifty-six primer pairs generated pcr amplicons, among which  <dig> had polymorphism detected, and exhibited clear and unambiguous single-locus amplification on the parents.

of these  <dig> ssr markers tested, the  <dig> ssr markers defined on m. acuminata "gobusik" have been extensively used in mapping  <cit>  and diversity analysis  <cit> . the other ones are newly defined. this may explain that 76% of the former were mapped, while only 43% of the latter were usable.

borneo was less heterozygous than p. lilin. of the  <dig> mapped ssr, borneo displayed  <dig> heterozygous patterns  as opposed to  <dig> for p. lilin ;  <dig> of the segregating markers segregated in both parents , while  <dig> ssr markers segregated only in borneo and  <dig> ssr markers in p. lilin. genotyping data are available on gcp registry http://gcpcr.grinfo.net/index.php?app=datasets&inc=files_list.

dart markers
the two parents and  <dig> progenies were hybridized on dart array. four hundred and eighty-five markers were found to be polymorphic out of the  <dig> present on the array . among the  <dig> markers,  <dig> could be attributed to a linkage group but were impossible to map . among the  <dig> darts markers that were mapped,  <dig>  were contributed by borneo only,  <dig>  were contributed by p. lilin only, while  <dig>  were contributed by both parents. in the reference map,  <dig> fully identical markers, probably resulting from redundancy, were discarded. genotyping data are available on the gcp registry http://gcpcr.grinfo.net/index.php?app=datasets&inc=files_list.

anchorage between parental maps
the attribution of markers to one of the two parents enabled development of two parental maps. as a first step towards a tentative synthetic map avoiding parent-specific pseudolinkages, the two parental maps were compared at different lod scores using  <dig> common markers  serving as anchors. the congruence between parental linkage groups was best at lod  <dig>  for borneo and lod  <dig> for p. lilin . five consensus linkage groups  were identified on the basis of the full co-linearity of the anchor markers. for the other groups, marker alignments or groupings differed between the parental maps. at lod  <dig>  the borneo markers homologous to markers of plg <dig> split into two groups. they still split at lod  <dig> , but some of them aggregated with markers homologous to those of plg  <dig>  the groups blg <dig>  blg <dig> and blg  <dig> in the borneo map built at lod  <dig>  lump into a major group in the p. lilin map  even up to lod  <dig>  at lod  <dig>  the p. lilin map exhibited  <dig> linkage groups and the grouping was no longer consistent with the borneo representation.

loci labeled with asterisks showed distorted segregation . brackets] indicate segments with highly distorted markers . in ssr names, mmacir has been abbreviated to cir, mmecir to ecir.

the map based on borneo female parent had  <dig> linkage groups that were delineated at lod  <dig>  with  <dig> markers  . the map spanned about  <dig> cm, with an average marker spacing of  <dig>  cm. the largest linkage group comprised  <dig> markers whereas the smallest encompassed  <dig> markers. of the  <dig> segregating markers initially tested,  <dig> darts remained ungrouped and mmacir  <dig> was removed.

regarding the p. lilin parent, the map obtained at lod  <dig> comprised  <dig> markers of the  <dig> initially tested , distributed in  <dig> main linkage groups  . the map spanned about  <dig> cm with an average marker spacing of about  <dig>  cm. the markers were not uniformly distributed, one major group  comprising  <dig> markers. sixteen markers remained ungrouped, including  <dig> ssrs and  <dig> darts. four more dart markers  were removed because they disrupted the order of the linkage groups .

segregation distortions
twelve percent of the markers deviated from the expected mendelian ratio  on the borneo female parent , whereas this percentage reached 24% with the p. lilin male parent . so, borneo exhibited half the rate of highly distorted markers of p. lilin. the distortions were of the same order of magnitude for ssr and dart markers.

skewed segregations affected different linkage group segments of the parental maps. for example, markers segregated without any distortion on blg  <dig>  blg  <dig> and blg  <dig>  whereas half of the markers were highly distorted on plg 1+2+ <dig>  similarly, markers on the homologous borneo group followed mendelian ratio  while one segment on plg  <dig> showed strongly skewed marker segregations . conversely, borneo was affected by highly skewed markers on the segmented blg  <dig> while the corresponding loci on p. lilin exhibited weaker distortions . among the most highly significant distorted segments , allelic ratios of the markers varied from 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> depending on the linkage group and sometimes on the location within a linkage group.

linkage group tree representations
adapted tree analyses provide an alternative representation of linkage groups. trees have been drawn from simulated data of different features of chromosomal rearrangements . it was applied to all p. lilin parental linkage groups defined by joinmap®  <dig> at lod  <dig>  figure  <dig> summarizes the different patterns obtained from the observed data. most of the p. lilin linkage groups displayed figures of homologous chromosomes  with alignment of markers along the nj tree similar to that of figure 3-a, even for plg  <dig>  which displayed skewed segregations. two atypical nj trees were observed for plg  <dig>  and plg  <dig> +  <dig> +  <dig> .

concerning plg  <dig>  we propose that a nested inversion pattern differentiates the two homologous chromosomes . this inversion should fit the observed cytogenetical inversion features. when this possibility was subjected to nj tree analysis, we observed a good homology between the observed and simulated trees .

the representation of plg 1+2+ <dig>  is more complex. the homologs of the anchor markers from blg  <dig> and blg  <dig> are tightly linked, while the homolog markers of blg  <dig> are loosely linked to those of blg  <dig> and blg  <dig>  actually, the aggregation of plg  <dig>  looked very similar to those of independent groups artificially grouped at lod  <dig>  probably indicating a pseudo-linkage due to skewed markers  <cit> , and plg  <dig> is independent from plg  <dig> and plg  <dig> 

in contrast, the pattern of markers from plg  <dig> and plg  <dig> suggests a "translocation" of markers from plg  <dig> into plg  <dig> in proximal location. the rearrangement is non-reciprocal as the nj tree  would display three arms instead of four in case of reciprocity as observed in prunus  <cit>  and derived from a simulation as shown in figure 3-d. furthermore it looks like the typical y image of figure 3-c. the best hypothesis would be the existence of a duplication, as suggested by wilson  <cit> , of a segment of plg  <dig> into plg  <dig> , but not a true translocation  <cit>  as we neither observed the segregation ratio nor the genotyping profiles expected with a translocation. this hypothesis of segment duplication, associated with lethality of the type of gamete containing the duplicated segment in heterozygous configuration  is also consistent with the observed allelic pattern and allelic frequencies and is in agreement with meiosis configurations . the expected mendelian segregation  observed at the ends of plg  <dig> and plg  <dig> might result from higher recombination rates in telomeric segments  <cit>  associated with the progressively decreasing rearrangement effect on segregation ratios with increasing distance from the inserted segment. furthermore, the genetic distance observed between markers within this duplicated segment is low, as found in other studies  <cit> ;  <cit> . taking into account this low recombination frequency in the duplicated segment and the increasing frequencies of recombination from the inserted segment to the chromosome ends, the theoretical and observed nj trees  are very similar.

on plg  <dig>  we observed highly skewed markers  especially at the end of the linkage group, while corresponding markers on the same borneo group are not distorted . these distortions are located in segments that are collinear when mapping with joinmap®  <dig> and that also align along the nj tree representation . therefore we propose as a hypothesis that this region may be subjected to gene selection, meiotic drive or epigenetic effect rather than affected by structural rearrangements.

overall, based on nj tree analysis, allele segregations and cytogenetical studies, we propose the presence of two structural rearrangement events for p. lilin. the first is assumed to be a segment duplication of plg  <dig> into plg  <dig> , instead of a translocation. the second can be a translocation of a plg  <dig> segment into itself . figure  <dig> presents a putative map of p. lilin integrating these structural rearrangements.

for borneo, at lod  <dig> , representations given by the nj tree seem to indicate a translocated segment from blg  <dig> to blg  <dig> . to reproduce the pentavalent or hexavalent pairing features  observed on meiosis plates , we need to decrease the grouping lod score down to  <dig> . in this case, parts of blg  <dig>  blg  <dig> and blg  <dig> are associated. nevertheless, even in this case, we did not find any chromosome rearrangement model that could explain the very high distortions  observed on homolog markers of plg  <dig>  while blg  <dig> and blg  <dig> did not display any. furthermore, all homologous markers of plg  <dig> only aggregate at lod  <dig>  the third group indicated by cytogenetical studies is still not clearly found, nor is the kind of rearrangement that can lead to such a feature.

synthetic map
a final synthetic map was constructed at lod  <dig> . it was first established from the aligned parental linkage groups described above . for the remaining linkage groups, the grouping and the marker alignments kept as skeleton were chosen from the parent assumed to be free from any structural rearrangement on the considered linkage group. the absence or presence of putative structural rearrangements was assessed with nj tree representation and segregation analysis. priority was given to linkage groups exhibiting a linear nj tree and mendelian segregations. a few cases of linear nj tree with limited distorted segregation were also retained.

from the  <dig> initial dart markers,  <dig> fully identical markers were discarded and  <dig> dart markers remained ungrouped. five ssr markers and  <dig> darts associated with structural rearrangements in one parent were discarded from this reference map because they disrupted its construction . therefore, some markers present in the parental maps are absent from the reference map. the observed recombination frequency between two markers, one located in the structural rearrangement and one outside, aggregates the results of two different situations: one is linkage, the other one is independency. in practice, the recombination frequency is the mean of recombination of linked markers  and of independent markers  in the reference map. consequently, these markers disrupt both the calculation distances between markers and the ordering when compared to data obtained from the non-rearranged parent.

altogether, this synthetic map includes  <dig> markers  among which  <dig> are anchor markers. it is divided into  <dig> linkage groups covering  <dig> cm. the markers are distributed with a mean of  <dig> markers per linkage group and an average marker spacing of  <dig>  cm.

discussion
this study reports an important effort in marker development and linkage analysis. ssrs provide co-dominant, multi-allelic, locus-specific markers which simplify both the construction of each parental genetic map and the comparison between the two parental maps. dart provide dominant markers which are generally well-distributed in the genome and very cost-effective  <cit> . they efficiently contribute to map saturation and they constitute an asset that can easily be used for other materials in the future. the main difficulty of our study was the general occurrence of segregation distortions and the risk of pseudolinkages.

distortions from expected mendelian segregation have been observed in both inter-specific and intra-specific derivatives with different magnitudes. they can have multiple origins, including structural rearrangements  <cit> .

in the genus lens, for example, distorted markers were observed in different linkage groups, but only one translocation was detected by cytogenetical studies and pollen viability analysis; its location was defined on the basis of marker locations in different crosses  <cit> . in helianthus,  <cit> , reciprocal translocations were described by conjugating observations of abnormal pairing in meiosis, studies on pollen viability and mapping data. the latter revealed an abnormally large linkage group covering close to half of the map. nevertheless, the causes of the observed segregation distortions often remained unclear. in prunus inter-specific crosses skewed markers were located on a reciprocal translocation  <cit> . the hypothesis was validated by studying pollen fertility in the segregating progeny and by cytogenetical observations during meiosis. most examples show that an array of methods is generally needed to differentiate between the different causes of segregation distortion.

in musa, earlier studies did not determine the causes of segregation distortion  <cit> . our use of nj tree representations helped sort between the segregation distortions linked to structural rearrangements and those due to other phenomena such as gene selection, meiotic drive or epigenetic transmission effects. this use led to identification of one likely case of local direct selection on plg <dig> and a couple of likely structural rearrangements.

earlier cytogenetic studies of meiosis in p. lilin  <cit>  described this cultivar as a structural heterozygote featuring one translocation and at least one inversion on the basis of trivalents and bridges. in subsequent observations, dodds and simmonds  <cit>  and shepherd  <cit>  suggested that one of the exchanged segments contains a small sub-terminal inversion, but wilson  <cit>  stressed that no closed tetravalent was observed and suggested a duplication rather than a translocation. our interpretation features a duplication between plg  <dig> and plg  <dig> and an inversion within plg 10; it is therefore fully in line with earlier inferences.

the structural status of borneo is less clear. early cytogenetical studies described borneo as a structural homozygote  <cit> , in consistency with its full fertility; yet some rearrangements are suspected as well as the presence of a unit with "one of both arms rather short"  <cit>  our cytogenetic observations suggested that it is heterozygous for at least two rearrangements involving three linkage groups. some bac-fish experiments should be undertaken, as was done for m. acuminata  <cit> , among the parents of an f <dig> mapping population 'calcutta 4' and 'madang'  <cit>  in order to physically assess the nature of the rearrangements. based on our results, the investigations should focus first some of the linkage groups highlighted above: plg <dig>  plg <dig>  blg  <dig>  blg  <dig> and blg  <dig>  this is possible with the availability of several bac libraries  <cit> .

in our effort to produce a saturated map of musa, we initially meant to study a progeny involving one structurally homozygous parent. the unexpected structural heterozygosity of borneo induced additional complexity; yet it is likely that the rearrangement patterns involved different chromosomes and did not overlap in the two parents. thus, we think our synthetic map can be a valuable reference for a m. acuminata genetic map. whether this map corresponds to a "standard structure"  <cit>  representative of the ancestral state requires confirmation with other mapping studies involving other germplasm compartments. the finding of structural heterozygosity in the "wild" borneo challenges the idea that the wild forms have developed several genome arrangements in distinct populations, identified as subspecies, which then cause sterility and favor domestication among hybrids. borneo belongs to the microcarpa subspecies and has been found recently  <cit>  to include some bansksii subsp. alleles, indicating probably an intersubspecific origin. the structural heterozygosity in this case should be sufficiently limited to not affect fertility.

it may be difficult to establish the ancestral configuration by comparing only a genome forms; the use of a b genome representative as an outgroup will certainly be helpful.

the case of the relation between linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> in p. lilin sheds light on particular aspects of structural polymorphisms in banana. our current interpretation is the duplication of a segment featuring at least fifteen markers, including eight ssr loci, even if the breakpoint on plg <dig> should be refined more precisely. coding the markers/alleles as co-dominant  or as dominant  in the segregation data does not modify the global size of the segment: these markers span on about  <dig> cm in p. lilin. in contrast, they span on about  <dig> cm in borneo.

if the cause for the distortions and the pseudolinkages is indeed this duplication, it implies that p. lilin has three copies of the loci involved in the duplication. yet no case was found where one of these loci displayed three distinct alleles, meaning that the duplication features a haplotype that is conserved along a segment which spans  <dig> cm in the borneo configuration. this would mean that this duplication is recent enough for bearing no trace of ssr mutation nor of recombination with other haplotypes. p. lilin is clearly incompletely fertile, but it was sufficiently fertile to produce the large number of progeny that we analyzed. we cannot exclude that this configuration is unique to p. lilin, neither can we exclude it from a wider group of wild accessions that exchange genetic material. this leads to the question of the population dynamics of structural heterozygosity: if a heterozygous configuration leads to genetic map constrictions, and if it does not hamper reproduction, a fraction of the progeny that is again heterozygous should display the same genetic constriction. this could induce specific linkage disequilibrium in the area of rearrangement. therefore, it can be worth testing whether this type of evidence, namely linkage disequilibrium among stretches of markers, can help infer the distribution of structural rearrangements in the whole species.

as a more direct route, strong segregation distortions induced by structural rearrangements can also be monitored using small-sized progenies  and be subjected to the neighbor joining approach that we have used.

CONCLUSIONS
we present here the first dense genetic map of m. acuminata with the expected eleven linkage groups, on the basis of a synthesis between two parental maps featuring distinct patterns of segregation distortions. this map can serve as a tentative reference for further studies. it displays  <dig> ssr and  <dig> dart loci, covering  <dig> cm with an average density of one marker for  <dig>  cm.

it will be central in further analysis of the genome of musa. current projects plan a complete sequencing of the a genome of a particular doubled haploid derived from pahang, a malaccensis genotype. in that project, density of the genetic map will be further increased.

this synthetic map is also accompanied with hypotheses for structural rearrangements and selection pressures which occur in the two parents, with more precision in p. lilin. our understanding of these rearrangements is not complete, but our findings do provide testable hypotheses for molecular cytogenetic studies for visualizing structural polymorphisms. it is clear that more genome structure analyses are needed for understanding the patterns in the a genome, which are very important for breeding activities. the ssr markers provide a framework for selecting polymorphic markers for new mapping studies, whereas the dart markers will efficiently complement a loose ssr selection for efficiently filling potential gaps. therefore, new maps can be quickly generated when new progenies are available. a complementary ad hoc effort could also be needed to develop co-dominant markers which can reveal dosage effect in order to help resolve patterns which involve structural rearrangements.
