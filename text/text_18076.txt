BACKGROUND
onchocerciasis  is a disease caused by onchocerca volvulus, a filarial worm transmitted by the bite of black flies. onchocerciasis ranks fourth among the causes of blindness and visual impairment in developing countries  <cit> . inbrazil, about  <dig> % of the population needs treatment, all of whom reside in a vast single focus , bordering venezuela  <cit> .

simulium guianense appears to be the main vector in this focus  <cit> , but its biology is not well studied. saliva of hematophagous arthropods contains a vast array of pharmacologically active compounds that act as anticlotting, antiplatelet, vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory compounds. some functional and biochemical characterizations have been previously obtained with salivary gland homogenates  of simulium vittatum, such as anti-fxa  <cit> , antithrombin  <cit> , apyrase  <cit> , hyaluronidase  <cit> , vasodilators  <cit>  and immunomodulators  <cit> .

recently, sialotranscriptomes  of nearctic and neotropical black flies have revealed transcripts related to the functions previously described  <cit> . analysis of salivary transcriptomes of bloodfeeding arthropods--including different genera of mosquitoes  <cit> , sand flies  <cit> , biting midges  <cit> , black flies  <cit> , ticks  <cit> , bed bugs  <cit> , triatomines  <cit> , tse tse flies  <cit>  and fleas  <cit> --have found a great diversity of protein families in different arthropods and suggested a fast evolution of several of these salivary protein families, possibly resulting from their host's immune pressure. thus, because of this great diversity, many salivary proteins do not show sequence similarities to other known proteins. this also reflects the independent evolution of blood feeding within insects, which occurred approximately  <dig> times within this group  <cit> .

evidence suggests that the infraorder culicomorpha originated from a single bloodfeeding ancestor during the triassic, over  <dig> million years ago , with some families having lost this lifestyle  <cit> . black flies appear as more basal of the culicomorpha with regard to the medical importance in this clade. in contrast, the infraorder psychodomorpha, which includes sand flies, probably had a very early origin and isolated phylogenetic position  <cit> . data suggest that, alternatively, the blood feeding behavior could have evolved independently in each family of the nematocera  <cit> .

the simuliidae family contains  <dig>  named species,  <dig> of which are fossil, and is widely distributed to all biogeographic regions  <cit> . their meal source is based on warm-blooded animals including man, cattle, and birds, but also reptiles  <cit> . in this work, we compare the sialotranscriptome of female s. guianense with those of other black flies available in the non-redundant  protein database of the national center for biotechnology information  database: simulium vittatum  and simulium nigrimanum .

we present the analysis of a set  <dig>  cdna sequences out of  <dig>  that yielded good sequence quality,  <dig> % of which were associated with secreted products. we describe  <dig> coding sequences--mostly full length--the majority of which were confirmed by tryptic digestion/mass spectrometry . most salivary proteins found have no known function. our results should help to understand the molecular evolution of black flies to blood feeding, characterize the role of some protein families associated with sugar feeding, and contribute to our understanding of the role of the simulium saliva in the transmission of o. volvulus. it also consists of a platform for mining novel antihemostatic compounds and vaccine candidates against filariasis.

RESULTS
cdna library characteristics
a total of  <dig>  clones out of  <dig>  that were sequenced yielded good quality sequences and were used to assemble a database that yielded  <dig> clusters of related sequences,  <dig> of which contained only one est. the consensus sequence of each cluster is named either a contig  or a singleton . as indicated before  <cit> , this paper uses "cluster" or "contig" to denote sequences derived from both consensus sequences and singletons. the  <dig> clusters were compared using the program blastx, blastn, or rpsblast  <cit>  to the nr protein database of the ncbi, a gene ontology database   <cit> , the cdd of the ncbi  <cit>  and a custom-prepared subset of the ncbi nucleotide database containing either mitochondrial or rrna sequences.

as indicated in our previous work  <cit> , "because the libraries used are unidirectional, three-frame translations of the dataset were also derived, and open reading frames starting with a methionine and longer than 40-aa residues were submitted to the signalp server  <cit>  to help identify putatively secreted  proteins. the est assembly, blast, and signal peptide results were loaded into an excel spreadsheet for manual annotation and are provided in additional file  <dig> "

four categories of expressed genes derived from the manual annotation of the contigs were created . the s category contained  <dig> % of the clusters and  <dig> % of the sequences, with an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. this value is 46% larger  than that seen in s. vittatum, where only 51% of ests encode s proteins, and  <dig> % larger than in s. nigrimanum .

the housekeeping  category had  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the clusters and sequences, respectively, and an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster. one singleton was classified as a transposable element , constituting less than  <dig> % of the ests or contigs. tes are a common finding in hematophagous sialotranscriptomes and most probably reflect regulatory transcripts repressing transposition rather than active transposition  <cit> . transcripts with matches to te were also found in s. nigrimanum sialotranscriptome  <cit> . finally,  <dig> % of the clusters, containing  <dig> % of all sequences, were classified as unknown , because no functional assignment could be made. this category had an average of  <dig>  sequences per cluster, and most of these consisted of singletons. a good proportion of these transcripts could derive from 3'or 5' untranslated regions of genes of the previous two categories, as was indicated for a sialotranscriptome of anopheles gambiae  <cit> .

s class of expressed genes
inspection of additional file  <dig> indicates  <dig>  ests associated to secreted products that were characterized to several families, including ubiquitous proteins families such as antigen- <dig>  kunitz domain-containing polypeptides, trypsin, amylase/maltase, apyrase, hyaluronidase, and lysozyme. insect-specific families, such as aegyptin and d7/obp superfamily, were also found. about  <dig> % of all secreted products revealed exclusively simulium-specific families, where the svep family contained  <dig> % of the sequences. others simulium-specific families were found such as collagen-like peptide, poly-q mucin, and glycine histidine-rich. some of these families  were found in previous transcriptomes from black flies  <cit> . novel putative families were deorphanized in s. nigrimanum.

h genes
the  <dig> clusters  attributed to h genes expressed in the salivary glands of s. guianense were further divided into  <dig> subgroups according to function . not surprisingly for an organ specializing in the secretion of polypeptides, the two larger sets within the h category were associated with protein synthesis machinery  and energy metabolism . this pattern was also observed in other sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects  <cit> .

exceptionally, the protein synthesis class revealed a significant increase of 38% more ests in s. guianense compared with s. vittatum . this increase was also observed in relation to s. nigrimanum , but it was not significant statistically .

we have arbitrarily included a group of  <dig> ests  with  <dig> clusters in the h category that represent highly conserved proteins of unknown function, presumably associated with cellular function. previously, sialomes of s. vittatum and s. nigrimanum described 24% and 27% of ests to this category, respectively. here, s. guianense also revealed an increase of  <dig> % and  <dig> % more ests than the species described above, respectively, which was statistically significant only in reference to s. nigrimanum . they are named "unknown conserved" in additional file  <dig>  these sets may help functional identification of the "conserved hypothetical" proteins as previously reviewed by galperin and koonin  <cit> . the complete list of all  <dig> gene clusters, along with further information about each, is given in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

analysis of the s. guianense sialome
several clusters of sequences coding for h and s polypeptides indicated in additional file  <dig> are abundant and complete enough to extract novel consensus sequences. a total of  <dig> novel sequences-- <dig> of which code for s proteins-- are grouped together in additional file  <dig>  with this database, we characterized the proteome via analysis of sds-page separated proteins that were tryptic digested and submitted to ms/ms analysis . the results of this experiment are integrated within the description of the deduced proteins from the transcriptome analysis. here, we used proteome analysis to confirm  <dig> of the  <dig> protein families found in this sialotranscriptome , which are described in more detail below. the reader is here informed that the introduction of the diverse protein families may contain text previously used in our publications on simulium sialomes  <cit>  and such text will appear in "quotes".

functional classification of s families from s. guianense
ubiquitous families or domains
enzymes
several transcripts found in the sialotranscriptome s. guianense encode proteins with sequence similarity to several secreted enzymes such as glycosidase, serine proteases, hyaluronidases, apyrase, adenosine deaminase , and destabilase. they can be associated with blood feeding, sugar feeding, or both, as follows:

glycosidases
"amylases and maltases are ubiquitous enzymes that help digestion of carbohydrates and are commonly found in sialotrancriptomes from nematocera including mosquitoes, biting midges, sand flies, and black flies  <cit> . these enzymes can be recognized by the kog motif  <dig>  named alpha-amylase." the proteome of the mosquito an. gambiae has  <dig> members of this family, one of which  is expressed in the sgs  <cit> . the proteome of ae. aegypti contains  <dig> such enzymes, at least two of which are expressed in their sgs  <cit>  while culex quinquefasciatus has  <dig> such enzymes, with two also expressed in their sgs  <cit> . additional file  <dig> presents two truncated gene products coding for glycosidases . glycosidases of s. guianense have 79% sequence identity to other described black fly enzymes . phylogenetic analysis of the s. guianense protein sequences together with their closest blast matches against the nr database indicates that the two s. guianense proteins group into different clades with strong bootstrap support . sg- <dig> groups to other simulium enzymes, to a salivary sand fly enzyme, and to drosophilids, as indicated by clade i . sg- <dig>  on the other hand, groups with a second set of simulium enzymes and, with 76% bootstrap support, to culicine mosquitoes and salivary biting midge enzymes, <cit>  as shown by clade ii . notice that the mosquitoes, black flies, and culicoides sequences each group within subclades having strong bootstrap support, as expected. a third clade of mosquito-only enzymes  is also obtained, which merges without strong bootstrap support to clade ii. interestingly, the mosquito enzymes in both clades ii and iii have all been previously described in salivary transcriptomes, suggesting a common origin of these sugar-hydrolyzing enzymes in the ancestral fly originating mosquitoes, black flies, and biting midges. these results indicate that the two s. guianense sequences appear to be a product of ancient gene duplication, sg- <dig> from clade i being the most ancient, as it groups with enzymes of brachycera, while the two salivary gene products from culicine mosquitoes appear to derive from a gene duplication after the split of the culicidae. the sequences of the glycosidases sg- <dig> and sg- <dig> found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense were confirmed by proteome analysis within the fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, just above the 49-kda standard .

serine proteases
"serine proteases are commonly found within hematophagous insect sialomes  <cit>  except in sand flies, where it was only found in the phlebotomus ariasi sialome  <cit> . this family has an important role in the immune system, acting as prophenoloxidase activators or in digesting skin matrix components such as in an elastase function, or hydrolyzing host blood-clotting components such as fibrinogen/fibrin, or activating plasminogen  <cit> . in ae. aegypti, transcripts coding for serine protease with the cub domain were reported, indicating specialized substrate recognition  <cit> ." the sialotrancriptome of s. guianense allowed the identification of transcripts coding for three secreted serine proteases varying with predicted mol wt between  <dig>  and  <dig> kda, which may derive from three polymorphic genes. alignment of representative members of these three gene products from s. guianense  with their best blast matches  produces a phylogram indicative of one clade that is related to mosquito and fruit fly sequences with strong bootstrap support  and one additional simulium-specific clade, the latter containing two sub clades. this simulium-specific clade is quite divergent, having only 27% or less identity to their best diptera match, indicating fast evolution of this clade. the sub-clades  each contain one enzyme from each of the simulidae thus far analyzed for their sialotranscriptome, indicating conservation of these threee salivary expressed genes in black flies. an additional s. nigrimanum sequence is also found in this simulium-specific clade, indicating that a fourth gene may be expressed in this fly. the serine protease proteins found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense were confirmed by proteome analysis within the fractions f <dig> and f <dig>  located near the 28-kda marker, consistent with its predicted  mature weight of these proteins .

hyaluronidases
hyaluronidases are enzymes that cleave hyaluronic acid, which is a main component of the extracellular matrix in vertebrates. this enzyme was first described in saliva of new world lutzomyia longipalpis  <cit>  and thereafter in the sgs of several other old and new sand fly species  <cit> . it was also reported in s. vittatum  <cit> . hyaluronidases also have been described in the sialotranscriptome of c. quinquesfaciatus  <cit>  and glossina morsitans morsitans  <cit> . interestingly, although phlebotomus papatasi and phlebotomus dubosqui sghs displayed hyaluronidase activity, no such transcripts were found in their cdna libraries  <cit> . hyaluronidase transcripts were also absent from s. vittatum and s. nigrimanum sialotranscripomes  <cit> . here, we found one full-length sequence  coding for a protein with  <dig>  mol wt and pi  <dig>  matching the pfam <dig> domain named "glyco_hydro_ <dig>  hyaluronidase" with an e value of 1e- <dig>  the nr database of the ncbi revealed identities above 43% to hyaluronidases from lu. longipalpis and phlebotomus arabicus in addition to matching other insect enzymes from pediculus humanus and some vespids; however, these non-dipteran sequences were only 34% identical at the aa sequence level. fourteen tryptic peptides obtained by ms/ms had matches to hyaluronidase protein within fraction  <dig>  just above the 38-kda standard and consistent with the predicted 37-kda mature mol wt of this protein .

apyrase
"this enzyme hydrolyzes atp and adp to amp and orthophosphates and has been commonly found in blood feeding arthropods, where it has been suggested as a typical case of convergent evolution  <cit> . because adp and atp are important activators of platelet and neutrophils, apyrase activity removes these agonists of hemostasis and inflammation  <cit> . different genes have been described for this activity such as members of the 5'-nucleotidase family in mosquitoes and triatomines  <cit> , the cimex-type apyrase family in bed bugs and sand flies  <cit>  and the type cd- <dig> protein family in fleas  <cit> . expression of this enzyme in mosquitoes has helped to understand the feeding preference in anopheles, aedes, and culex genus  <cit> . as culex has birds as the primary source of blood and does not face the platelet barrier, members of this genus reveal little or absent expression of this enzyme  <cit> ." in black flies, this enzyme activity was previously described in sghs from several species with different degrees of anthropophy or zoophilic, gonotrophic cycle and vector or non-vector status, revealing dependence on ca+ <dig> or mg+ <dig> ions for activation and with positive association to species with confirmed vector status for o. volvulus  <cit> . while we do not know the origin of black fly salivary apyrases, transcripts coding for members of the 5'-nucleotidase family have been previously described in s. vitattum and s. nigrimanum  <cit> . studies in black fly sialotrancriptomes also revealed an increase in the expression of putative apyrase transcripts in s. nigrimanum when compared with s. vittatum, with statistically significant difference   <cit> . the 5'-nucleotidases are ubiquitous enzymes usually found bound to the extracellular face of biologic membranes through a glycophosphatidyl-inositol phosphate anchor  <cit> . however, salivary secreted enzymes of mosquitoes  <cit>  and triatomine bugs  <cit>  lack the carboxyterminal domain where the glycolypid is anchored, allowing their secretion. here, we found  <dig> transcripts coding for the putative salivary apyrase of s. guianense . alignment of the putative apyrase of s. guianense with their simulid homologs plus vertebrate sequences known to be membrane anchored reveals the lack of the carboxyterminal site for the glycolipid anchor in s. guianense , as was also found for other simulium putative apyrases  <cit> , indicating the s. guianense enzyme to be secreted. fifty-eight tryptic peptides were deducted by ms/ms with matches to apyrase protein  originated from fraction  <dig>  located just below the 62-kda standard .

adenosine deaminase 
ada transcripts, although previously found in sialotranscriptome of mosquitoes and sand flies, <cit>  here appear for the first time in black fly sialotranscriptomes. ae. aegypti salivary homogenates hydrolyze adenosine  to inosine, and then to hypoxantine plus ribose, with enzymatic activities in saliva and sghs  <cit> . recombinant ada from p. dubosqi was shown to have potent activity  <cit> . here, we found a singleton est producing one truncated sequence with 68% identity with ae. aegypti ada. puzzlingly, ado is a powerful antiplatelet and vasodilator, and the presence of a salivary ada should be considered non-adaptative; however, ado is also a potent inducer of mast cell degranulation, and for this reason it may be in the insect's interest to remove this product. interestingly, p. papatasi does not codify transcripts to ada but contains ado and amp in its saliva, which acts as the main salivary vasodilator  <cit> .

destabilase
"this enzyme is an endo-ε--lys isopeptidase, which cleaves isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminase  between gln glutamine γ-carboxamide and ε-amino groups of lysine and was first described in the saliva of leeches. its activity leads to dissolution of stabilized fibrin  <cit> . destabilases are members of the lysozyme superfamily of proteins  <cit> ." a 3' truncated singleton est is 86% identical to s. nigrimanum destabilase . it is still unknown whether salivary homogenates of black flies have destabilase activity.

protease inhibitor domains
serine protease inhibitors 
serpins were previously reported in sialomes of ae. aegypti, ae. albopictus, ochlerotatus triseriatus and lu. longipalpis. the gene coding for the protein gi| <dig> in ae. aegypti represents the main salivary anticlotting protein in this mosquito with specificity to fxa  <cit> , having as homologue the protein gi| <dig> in ae. albopictus. targets of others serpins found in mosquito sialotranscriptomes are unknown  <cit> . here, we found one singleton est  coding for a 3' truncated serpin with 60% identity to a homologous serine protease inhibitor from ae. aegypti and an. gambiae. serpins have not been found in black fly sialotranscriptomes, possibly because these flies use kunitz-domain proteins as anticlotting agents.

kunitz-domain protease inhibitors
"kunitz domain-containing proteins are associated with protease inhibitors and so far have been found in sialotranscriptomes of nematocera black flies and biting midges but not in mosquitoes, sand flies, or bloodsucking hemiptera. kunitz domain-containing proteins, however, are abundant in tick sialotranscriptomes." hematophagous arthropods secrete protease inhibitors that can act in specific points of the coagulation cascade, mainly against thrombin or factor xa . this activity has been previously described in sghs of several black fly species such as s. vittatum, s. ochraceum, s. argus, and s. metallicum  <cit>  and culicoides midges  <cit> . the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense contains a typical single kunitz protein deducted from three ests . this protein has its best blastp match to its homologous s. nigrimanum  and s. vittatum  proteins. previously, s. vittatum salivary homogenates were shown to have potent fxa inhibitory activity, but its molecular nature remains unknown  <cit> . salivary homogenates of s. guianense also inhibited the same target of the coagulation cascade . it is possible that the fxa inhibitor of simulium resides in a kunitz domain-containing protein. two tryptic peptides obtained by ms/ms matching kunitz-domain protein  were found within fraction  <dig>  located just below the 6-kda standard .

ubiquitous protein families
immunity-related products
in this group, we found full coding sequences to two ubiquitous antimicrobial peptides: lysozyme and cepropin. these families are commonly found in hematophagous arthropods, and their presence was previously reported in black fly sialotrancriptomes  <cit> .

the s. guianense sialotranscriptome revealed  <dig> ests coding for members of the lysozyme family , where several possible alleles of the same gene were identified. s. guianense salivary lysozyme is 79% identical to s. nigrimanum salivary lysozyme and 52% identical to its closest mosquito relative . lysozyme activity in s. guianense was confirmed to exist in sghs . this activity was described in both male and female mosquitoes  <cit> . seven tryptic peptides deducted by ms/ms had matches to lysozyme protein  within fraction  <dig>  located just below the 6-kda standard .

cecropins are small secreted basic proteins of  <dig> kda mol wt, rich in aliphatic aas, mainly val, with highest conservation in its carboxy terminal region. ten ests from the s. guianense sialotranscriptome code for two closely related, possibly allelic, cecropins. these cecropins, as expected, have their best matches to other simulium and mosquito cecropins. the cecropin peptides  found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense were confirmed by proteome analysis within the fraction  <dig>  located just above the 3-kda marker, consistent with the predicted 3-kda mature mol wt of this protein .

antigen- <dig> family
"this ubiquitous family belongs to the wider cap superfamily  <cit> . most members have no known function, but a few have been related to pathogen defenses in plants, as toxins in snake and lizard venoms  <cit> , as a platelet aggregation inhibitor in a tabanid fly  <cit> , and as a possible inhibitor of the classical pathway of complement activation in the stable fly  <cit> ." members of this family are found in all nematoceram sialotranscriptomes  <cit> . the annotated an. gambiae proteome reveals  <dig> proteins for this family,  <dig> of which are expressed in the sgs  <cit> . similarly, the ae. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus proteome have over  <dig> members of the family, of which at least  <dig> are expressed in their sgs  <cit> . the s. guianense sialotranscriptome reveals two clusters coding for cap family members. the phylogram resulting of the alignment of the two s. guianense proteins with their  <dig> best blastp matches from the nr protein database  reveals one clade of bloodsucking nematocera with relatively strong bootstrap support , and strong bootstrap support for the sub-clades containing each of the four families. interestingly, all members of this clade  were found in sialotrancriptomes, suggesting a common salivary ancestor for this particular cap-coding gene within nematocera. the s. guianense protein sg- <dig> is outside this clade and may represent an additional simulium gene member of the cap family that has been recruited for a salivary function. thirty tryptic peptides deducted by ms/ms had matches for an antigen- <dig> protein  within fraction  <dig>  located just above the 28-kda marked, near the predicted 30-kda mature mol wt of this protein .

yellow family
this family is insect-specific in eukaryotes and received this name due to mutation of a gene that induces a yellow phenotype in drosophila, resulting from the disruption of melanin formation. in nematocera, this family is abundantly expressed in sand flies and has been suggested as important markers of vector exposure  <cit> . s. guianense reveals only one est to yellow protein with a match to yellow of c. quinquesfaciatus . interestly, s. vittatum also reveals one transcript to the yellow family  <cit> . the function of this protein in simulium remains unknown.

ml domain family
s. guianense contains one transcript coding for a protein containing the ml domain, which was not previously reported in black fly sialomes. this domain is implicated in lipid recognition, particularly in the recognition of pathogen-related products, but could also have a lysosomal function  <cit>  and thus have a housekeeping function. it has an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold similar to that of e-set. the blast to nr database suggests similarity to niemann-pick type c- <dig> putative from an. aegypti  and similarities to mpa <dig> allergen from nasonia vitripennis . the function of this protein in s. guianense remains unknown.

lipocalins
lipocalins are proteins widely distributed in animals and plants. this protein family is highly expressed in triatomines, such as rhodnius prolixus, triatoma infestans  <cit> , triatoma brasiliensis  <cit>  and dipetalogaster maxima  <cit> . in triatomines, lipocalins are reported as carriers of nitric oxide, kratagonists  of biogenic amines, ado nucleotides, and thromboxane a <dig>  as well as inhibitors of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin and as allergens  <cit> . we found two ests coding for different lipocalins . the deducted aa sequence of both transcripts matches human apolipoprotein in the swissprot database. if secreted in saliva, these proteins are candidates for agonist lipid binding.

insect-specific families
aegyptin family
this protein family, commonly found in sialotranscriptomes of mosquitoes, was first named as 30-kda aedes allergen  <cit>  and as ge-rich protein  <cit> . it has revealed high levels of expression in the sialotranscriptome of anopheles funestus  <cit> . functional analyses of an ae. aegypti family member, named aegyptin, as well as a member from an. stephensi, have demonstrated its function as an antagonist of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and as a useful tool for inhibiting platelet-collagen interaction in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . previous black fly sialotranscriptomes have revealed proteins similar to aegyptin, supporting the common origin of hematophagy in mosquitoes and black flies as proposed by grimaldi and engel  <cit> . here, we found  <dig> ests of the s class  coding for what appear to be alleles of a single gene similar to aegyptin-like proteins, showing 60% identity to aegyptins from sialotranscriptomes of black flies and 35% to mosquito homologs. the alignment revealed ge-rich regions mainly in the middle of the sequences . thirty-seven tryptic peptides obtained by ms/ms had matches to aegyptin protein  within fraction  <dig>  located just above the 28-kda marker, consistent with predicted  mature weight of this protein .

diptera secreted protein from conserved insect family
five proteins found in sialotranscriptome of s. guianense were similar to secreted protein from insects. this family was previously described in s. nigrimanum sialotranscriptome. they vary between  <dig> and  <dig> kda mol wt with pi  <dig>  to  <dig> . the best matches to the nr database showed similarities to several families of diptera  and hymenoptera  maintaining a low degree of conserved aa. the phylogram suggests at least four different genes to exist in s. guianense. pattern-initiated psi-blast  using the initiation pattern g-x--x--x--x--x--x--x--x--x--x-- shows the diversity of this protein family within insects .

laminin-like secreted salivary protein found in simulium and culicoides
laminin-like proteins have been suggested to be extracellular matrix proteins  <cit> . the s. guianense sialotranscriptome revealed one truncated protein  with four ests coding to a s. vittatum homolog  and to a culicoides nubeculosus protein with 32% identity. two tryptic peptides obtained by ms/ms had matches for laminin-like protein within fraction  <dig>  just above the 62-kda standard .

d7/obp superfamily
"the odorant-binding protein family is ubiquitous in insects. the d <dig> protein family, specific to bloodsucking nematocera, is recognized as a member of the obp superfamily  <cit>  but it contains two additional α-helices  <cit> . short and long forms of the d <dig> family exist in which one or two d <dig> domains exist in the same protein, producing proteins with mature mol wt of ~ <dig> or ~ <dig> kda. in simulium, an extra-short family with ~ <dig> kda is also found, reminiscent of sand fly salivary proteins, which also have an ultra-short form but bear no similarities to the black fly proteins at the aa level  <cit> . "the s. guianense obp/d <dig> sequences were grouped in the three subfamilies described below.

long d <dig> family: two proteins with two obp domains are recognized in the s. guianense sialotranscriptome. when searched against the nr database using blastp, these proteins only produce significant matches to other simulium proteins, but all three produce two matches each to the pfam pbp_gobp domain when using the tool rpsblast, one in the first half and the other in the second half of the protein. a third truncated protein has only one obp domain but matches long d <dig> proteins of s. nigrimanum. long d <dig> proteins had tryptic peptides deducted by ms/ms within fractions f <dig> and f <dig> near the 28-kda standard, consistent with the predicted  mature weight of these proteins .

d <dig> 16-kda family: two s. guianense proteins containing one obp domain were found. sg- <dig> produces significant similarities only to other simulium proteins, but sg- <dig> additionally retrieves obp from c. quinquefasciatus. tryptic peptides were deducted by ms/ms matches to d <dig> 16-kda proteins within the fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  just above the 6-kda marker .

ultra-short d <dig> proteins : this was the most expressed family within the d7/obp superfamily, encompassing  <dig> ests . all clusters contain signal peptide, suggesting secreted proteins. these data suggest the existence of at least four genes coding for ultra-short d <dig> proteins  and several possible alleles. only sg- <dig> was deducted by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just below the 6-kda marker .

simulium-specific families
of the  <dig>  ests of the s class,  <dig> ests are specific to simulium, encompassing  <dig> specific families. some families from s. nigrimanum were deorphanized, and a new family coding to kunitoxin-like proteins was first found in insect sialotranscriptomes. more details of these families are described below.

svep vasodilator family
"this family is specific to black flies and was originally described in sghs of s. vittatum, when it was named simulium vasodilator erythema protein  because it produced a prolonged vasodilation when tested in rabbit skin  <cit> . a recombinant protein  was expressed and functionally characterized as a potent vasodilator, possibly activating atp-dependent k+ channels  <cit> . this property has an important role during blood feeding and was suggested as one key compound of the competence vector of these flies in the transmission of onchocerca parasites  <cit> ." sialotranscriptomes of two black fly species identified svep to belong to a diverse multigene family with at least five genes for each species  <cit> . the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense also revealed proteins homologous to svep, totaling  <dig> ests with identities to other simulium sveps varying from  <dig> to 70%. alignment of members of this family showed sequences with similar sizes but with few conserved aas. comparative phylogenetic analysis of all svep proteins, after  <dig>  <dig> bootstraps grouped the majority of the members of s. vittatum in a specific clade  with 80% bootstrap support . the phylogram indicates at least three genes and several either recent gene duplications and/or alleles coding to members of this family . the protein sg- <dig> shares clade ii, with 92% of bootstrap support, with its homologous s. nigrimanum proteins. ests coding for sg- <dig> or very closely related proteins represent more than 50% of the sequences coding for svep members in this sialotranscriptome. clade iii groups only sveps from s. vittatum and s. nigrimanum without bootstrap support. clade iv reveals a possible case of gene duplication or expression  of a very polymorphic gene from s. guianense, and the last clade  groups two clusters  of s. guianense with its homologous s. nigrimanum , which appear completely distinct from other svep proteins. this scenario indicates that at least two genes  have common ancestors with s. nigrimanum and a third gene could have given rise to the increased of expression of this protein family, shown in clade iv, possibly with many recent gene duplications. interestingly, s. guianense has  <dig> ests coding for svep , more than double those of s. nigrimanum  and more than three times those of s. vittatum . these increases are highly significant, having scores of χ <dig> =  <dig>   and χ <dig> =  <dig>   to s. nigrimanum and s. vittatum, respectively. all sequences of svep proteins found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense were confirmed by proteome analysis within fraction  <dig>  located just above the 14-kda marker, consistent with the predicted  mature weight of svep protein .

h-rich, acid proteins of simulium
this protein family is known by its repeats of histidine, proline, glutamine, and glutamic acid residues. the repeat nature of these proteins had been suggested to interact with matrix proteins--possibly collagen--and function in a manner analogous to mosquito aegyptins, which inhibit collagen-induced platelet aggregation  <cit> . it is also possible that the his repeats act as antimicrobials by chelating zn or other trace element ions  <cit> . the black fly s. vittatum revealed this family to be the most abundant protein family expressed in its sialotranscriptome, with four repeat regions in its sequences   <cit> . similarly, mosquito and culicoides sialotrancriptomes also contain proteins with pro-his and gly-his repeats, but no other sequence similarities. the s. guianense sialotranscriptome has  <dig> % of all its secretory ests coding for members of this family, having above 70% identity to their homologous s. nigrimanum proteins. alignment  shows that the s. guianense sequences, together with their homologous s. nigrimanum proteins, contain one repeat region coding for pro-lys-pro residues, whereas in s. vittatum, the lys residue is substituted by gln. the phylogram of this protein family , when added to mosquito and culicoides sequences, reveals that all simulium sequences indicate  a common ancestor with 93% bootstrap support, with s. guianense sharing the same branch with s. nigrimanum .

mucins
"mucins are low-complexity proteins rich in serine and threonine residues. they are frequently found in sialotranscriptomes of bloodsucking arthropods such as mosquitoes  <cit> , biting midges  <cit> , bed bugs  <cit>  and black flies  <cit> . while these proteins' biologic function is not completely known, they have been suggested to provide protection to internal parts of the salivary ducts and also to have antimicrobial functions. they are commonly expressed in moist epithelia, where they offer protection  <cit>  in addition, mucins are modified post-translationally, and their mature forms have n-acetyl-galactosamine residues  <cit> ." two types of simulium-specific mucins are found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense, as follows.

simulium mucin family
nine proteins  in the s. guianense sialotranscriptome code for simulium mucin. their coding sequences have high amounts of ser + thr residues, varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, and from 40- <dig> galactosylation sites are predicted by the netoglyc server  <cit> . although similar sequences were found in the sialotranscriptome of s. nigrimanum, members of this family were absent in s. vittatum. alignment of the s. guianense and s. nigrimanum sequences reveals extensive similarities and identities along the whole sequence, but the phylogram clearly distinguishes s. guianense and s. nigrimanum specific clades . the variation among the s. guianense sequences may result from splice variants, polymerase slippage on nucleotide repeats, or multiple genes. several tryptic peptides were deduced by ms/ms with matches for simulium mucin within fraction  <dig>  and to fraction  <dig>  .

acid mucins proteins similar to basic 7- <dig> simulium family
the sialotranscriptome of s. nigrimanum reported small basic proteins  with mature weight varying from  <dig> to  <dig> kda and above 65% identity to orphan proteins found in the sialotranscriptome of s. vittatum  <cit> . the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense revealed  <dig> proteins  with best matches to members of this family--from both s. vittatum and s. nigrimanum--at a 50% identity level; however, these sequences code for acid, not basic, proteins  , with  <dig> to  <dig> potential galactosylation sites. notably, the s. guianense proteins have an extended central domain containing gly-ser repeats that vary in size among the proteins, which may reflect polymerase slippage among closely related genes . the phylogenetic tree cluster produces monospecific branches indicative either of single polymorphic genes or, alternatively, of multiple genes that possibly interact, producing gene conversions .

simulium collagen-like family
previous sialotranscriptomes of black flies reported specific proteins named as simulium collagen-like that are rich in pro-gly residues  <cit> . homologs to this family were found in the sialotranscriptome of s. guianense, with  <dig> clusters containing  <dig> ests . these  <dig> clusters are variations of only three sequences, which were aligned with their simulium homologs  to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in figure  <dig>  alignment revealed relatively conserved aas in the length of the sequence, with some gaps due to the longer sequences from s. vittatum. the phylogram maintains monospecific clades, as seen before for the mucin families . several tryptic peptides were deducted by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just above the 28-kda standard, above the predicted  mature weight of these proteins .

sv  <dig>  kda family
members of this family were first found in the sialotranscriptome of s. vittatum coding for proteins with  <dig>  kda mol wt  <cit> . later, sialotranscriptome of s. nigrimanum added six more transcripts to this family, suggesting it to be a divergent multifamily gene from simulium  <cit> . sequences from s. guianense maintain 60% identity to its homologous s. nigrimanum protein and 50% to the s. vittatum protein, coding for basic proteins  with mature weight varying from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda. alignment revealed low levels of conserved aas and at least four genes to s. guianense proteins of this family, marked as clades i-iv on figure  <dig>  several tryptic peptides were deducted by ms/ms in the fractions f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  and f <dig>  these fractions are located in the gel just above the 14-kda marker and just above the 3-kda marker. these results are consistent with the predicted  mature weight of these proteins .

basic 7- <dig> simulium family
the s. guianense sialotranscriptome added two more proteins  with six ests to this family coding to basic proteins  and  <dig> kda, with more than 59% similarities to their homologous s. nigrimanum and s. vittatum proteins. tryptic peptides were found by ms/ms within fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  just below the 6-kda standard . their function remains unknown.

simulium  <dig> -kda family
five more transcripts were added to this family, which appears highly conserved in sialotranscriptomes of simulium. their sequences code to acidic proteins  with  <dig> kda of mature weight and are devoid of cysteines. these peptides have unknown function.

simulium basic  <dig> -kda family
the cluster sg- <dig>  codes to a basic peptide of  <dig> kda mol wt and above 50% identity to their homologous proteins from s. vittatum and s. nigrimanum. this protein family also does not contain any cys residues on the mature peptide. four tryptic peptides originated from sg- <dig> were deduced by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just below the 6-kda standard, consistent with the predicted  mature weight of this protein .

simulium basic 13-kda
sg- <dig> added three more ests to this family, and has ~ 40% identity to other simulium proteins. they do not match other known proteins in any of the nr, go, kog, cdd, pfam, or smart databases. two tryptic peptides were deduced by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just below the 14-kda standard and consistent with the predicted  mature weight of this protein .

5-cys simulium family
this family received this name because it contains five cys in their sequences. one protein with nine ests is here reported in the s. guianense sialotranscriptome coding to an acid protein  with 14-kda mol wt and above 60% of identity to homologs found in simulium sialotranscriptomes. three tryptic peptides were deduced by ms/ms within fraction f <dig>  just below the 6-kda standard .

families deorphanized from s. nigrimanum. six additional protein families were characterized in common between s. nigrimanum and s. guianense, and no other known protein. they do not produce significant matches to others proteins in the nr database, and have thus deorphanized these s. nigrimanum proteins.

deorphanized s. nigrimanum 8- <dig> cys w family. this family is so named because their members contain from  <dig> to  <dig> conserved cys and trp in their mature sequences. the sialotranscriptome of s. nigrimanum revealed two distinct subfamilies, one containing  <dig> cys and  <dig> conserved trp and other containing  <dig> cys and  <dig> trp. this last group was suggested as a candidate protein in the etiology of pemphigus foliaceus due its similarity to proteins annotated as junctional adhesion molecules  <cit> . the s. guianense sialotranscriptome added two more proteins to this family , which contain  <dig> cys and  <dig> or  <dig> trp. these proteins were confirmed by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just below the 14-kda standard, near their predicted  mature weights . the function of this protein family remains unknown.

the sialotrancriptome of s. guianense added three more proteins  with  <dig> ests to the acid 28-kda family. page ms/ms results reported many tryptic peptides for these proteins within fraction f <dig>  just above the 28-kda marker , in accordance with the predicted  mature mol wt of these proteins. one protein  with nine ests was added to simulium basic 28-kda family. this protein  had several tryptic peptides deducted by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  consistent with a mass near  <dig> kda . the protein family named as 19-kda family, first seen in s. nigrimanum, was deorphanized with two proteins  with  <dig> ests coding for basic proteins of  <dig>  mw and signal peptide in their sequences. tryptic peptides were found by ms/ms within the fraction  <dig>  located just above the 14-kda standard and consistent with the predicted  mature weight of this protein . other putative secreted peptides were also deducted from the s. guianense sialotranscriptome, such as the cluster sg- <dig>  coding to basic protein of 8-kda mol wt that has 70% identity to the orphan protein of the s. nigrimanum sialotranscriptome previously named 8-kda basic protein family. five tryptic peptides were deducted by ms/ms within fraction  <dig>  just below the 6-kda marker . the smaller peptide found in this cdna library also represents one case of deorphanization with two ests in cluster sg- <dig> matching members of the sn basic  <dig> -kda family.

proteins currently unique to s. guianense
novel peptide similar to kunitoxin
the s. guianense has two clusters  coding to novel peptide distantly similar  to the snake peptide kunitoxin  <cit> . they are cys-rich and were suggested as protease and serine protease inhibitors in snake venom glands  <cit> . although the snake peptides have a typical kunitz domain, this domain is not identified in the black fly protein. kunitoxin inhibits plasmin and thrombin, blocks l-type calcium channels, and forms part of the neurotoxic complexes with pla <dig> molecules  <cit> . no similar sequences have been found so far in any previously described sialotranscriptome. together, the black fly family grouped eight ests coding for this secreted basic peptide with 8- <dig> kda. the page/ms/ms run reported four tryptic peptides for the kunitoxin-like protein at fraction  <dig>  coincident with a well-stained band between  <dig> and 6-kda standards .

CONCLUSIONS
sialotranscriptomes of hematophagous insects have revealed a large number of putative novel proteins, helping to understand the role of saliva in blood feeding, sugar feeding, and transmission of distinct parasites. in the last  <dig> years, two black fly sialotrancriptomes were described. the sialome of s. guianense represented the first from a species with confirmed vectorial status for onchocerciasis. black flies had their origin ~ <dig> mya , based on the fossil record  <cit> , and currently are among the best studied diptera, with  <dig>  species named,  <dig> of which are fossil  <cit> . their blood feeding mode has been proposed as a plesiomorphic character in the culicomorpha appearing during the triassic ~ <dig> mya and diverging in the late jurassic. based on tectonic plate movement, we believe that neotropical black flies share a distant common origin with neartic species, because union of the americas only occurred during the cenozoic, after the irradiation of mammals. thus, it is probable that this common black fly ancestor originated before the irradiation and expansion of mammals  <dig> mya and probably had birds or reptiles as their blood source, and this origin has indeed been maintained in some species; however, others could have diverged to feeding on mammals, including humans, conferring a level of plasticity  inside the simulidae family. for example, s. nigrimanum was found to have both feeding behaviors in different places. conversely, s. guianense has a high degree of anthropophily and was incriminated as the main vector of river blindness in the focus that includes brazil and venezuela   <cit> . this plasticity seen in the choice of host could be accompanied by gene duplications and fast evolution in several protein families.

here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of protein families found in the sialomes of three black flies from different subgenera: s. vittatum , s. nigrimanum  and s. guianense . notice that the last two are more closely overlapping in their characteristics. it is also important here to clear the taxonomic status of these species, mainly because s. nigrimanum shares the same geographic distribution as s. guianense, except for s. nigrimanum absence within the amazon region. currently, some authors  <cit>  group both species into the trichodagmia subgenus of simulium, while--based on phylogenetic analysis--others have determined  <cit>  that s. guianense belong to a different subgenus, thyrsopelma, and elevated the subgenus to genus .

independent of this taxonomic confusion, it is clear from the phylogenetic analysis containing the black fly species that, in the majority of cases, proteins from s. nigrimanum grouped with strong bootstrap support with those of s. guianense while excluding from the same sub clade the s. vittatum homologs, an expected result from the biogeography of the species. on the other hand, the number of families that were found exclusive of neotropical flies is entirely shared except for the s. guianense kunitoxin family, suggesting a relatively recent common ancestor between these south american flies.

it is important to note the increased expression in s. guianense of some proteins families such as d <dig>  svep, and other protein families specific to simulium , suggesting it to be associated with the anthropophilic and vectorial status of s. guianense in the transmission of onchocerciasis. indeed, the autogenous s. vittatum has the least expression of salivary secreted proteins and lacks many of the families found in the neotropical flies. s. nigrimanum was recently suggested as a potential vector of onchocerciasis  <cit> .

from a conservative perspective, we confirmed the presence of ubiquitous salivary protein families such as antigen- <dig>  yellow, ml domain, lipocalin, lysozyme, cecropin, serpin, kunitz domain, serine protease, hyaluronidase, apyrase, glycosidase, ada, and destabilase within the simulium genus; however, four of these protein families  were exclusive to the s. guianense sialotranscriptome. kunitz-domain proteins were seen in all black fly sialotranscriptomes. probably this family is responsible for the anticoagulant activity previously related to sghs in s. guianense  <cit> .

insect-specific protein families such as aegyptin, d <dig> family , and diptera secreted protein from conserved insect family and were found in all black fly sialotranscriptomes. the protein laminin-like was found only in s. guianense and s. vittatum sialotranscriptomes.

as expected, s. guianense contained several protein families previously found only in the sialotranscriptomes of s. nigrimanum and also s. vittatum such as the svep, h-rich acid proteins, acid mucin proteins similar to basic 7- <dig> simulium family, simulium collagen-like, sv  <dig> -kda family, 5-cys simulium family, basic 7- <dig> simulium family, simulium  <dig> -kda family, simulium basic  <dig> -kda family, and simulium basic 13-kda family. except for svep, a vasodilator, none of these proteins' function is known. it is possible that some of these families share the same function. additionally, the s. guianense sialotranscriptome revealed protein families previously found exclusive to s. nigrimanum such as the simulium mucin, 28-kda basic simulium family, acid 28-kda family, 19-kda family, sn 8- <dig> cys w family, 8-kda basic protein, and sn basic  <dig> -kda family, none of which have a known function. we also identified proteins currently unique to s. guianense such as a novel peptide similar to kunitoxin commonly found in venom of snakes. transcripts associated with sugar feeding, such as glycosidases, show a common ancestor in the diptera ; however, immune-related products such as trypsins appear phylogeneticaly more expanded relative to dipterous and non-dipterous insects such as lepidopterans. in mosquitoes, trypsin activity was suggested as the first line of defense against microorganisms during feeding  <cit> . s. guianense also has this activity confirmed by in-gel protein digestion assays from sghs  and possibly could conserve the same function in black flies. finally, our results contribute to understanding the role of simulium saliva in the transmission of o. volvulus and in the evolution of the salivary proteins in black flies. it also consists of a platform for mining novel antihemostatic compounds, epidemiologic markers of vector exposure, and vaccine candidates against filariasis.
