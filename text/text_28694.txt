BACKGROUND
mitotic progression and assembly of the bipolar mitotic spindle are regulated by several serine/threonine protein kinases, including members of the cyclin-dependent kinase , polo-like kinase , aurora, and nima-related kinase  families  <cit> . the founding member of nek family, the nima kinase of aspergillus nidulans, contributes to multiple aspects of mitotic progression including the timing of mitotic entry, chromatin condensation, spindle organization and cytokinesis. mammals contain a large family of eleven neks, the catalytic domain of which is evolutionarily related to that of nima  <cit> . nek <dig> has a central role in centrosome maturation and disjunction  <cit> , whereas nek <dig> and nek <dig> have been proposed to contribute to ciliary function  <cit> . besides nek <dig>  nek <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were also described to participate in centrosomal regulation  <cit> . nek <dig>  nek <dig>  <cit>  and nek <dig>  <cit>  are involved in the control of mitotic spindle formation, acting together in a mitotic kinase cascade, with nek <dig> being upstream of nek <dig> and nek <dig>  <cit> . nek kinases are also described as related to pathologies, particularly cancer, presenting thereby interesting potential chemotherapeutic targets  <cit> . recently, hnek <dig> was described to have its transcript, protein, and/or kinase activity levels highly elevated in a number of tumors and human cancer cell lines, indicating an important role for hnek <dig> in tumorigenesis  <cit> .

structurally, neks in general are characterized by having a conserved n-terminal catalytic domain, followed by a nonconserved c-terminal regulatory domain that varies in size and structure. however, nek <dig> and nek <dig> are significant exceptions to this, in that they are the smallest of the kinases and consist only of a catalytic domain with a relatively short n-terminal extension  <cit> . although they share significant similarity with each other, being ~86% identical within their catalytic domains, the n-terminal extensions are not conserved, and it has been suggested that they may play a role in differential regulation of the kinases  <cit> .

the mechanisms of regulation of hnek <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> kinases are currently unknown, and elucidating this pathway would provide relevant knowledge on early mitotic events as well as new hints for drug design and cancer therapy. however, hnek <dig> and hnek <dig> are the only nima-related kinases for which structures have been reported  <cit> . in this context, we present here the first low resolution three-dimensional structure of hnek <dig> protein in solution. saxs experiments, together with sec-mals and comparative molecular modeling revealed a monomeric mostly globular, though slightly elongated conformation for hnek <dig>  with a flexible disordered n-terminal domain.

RESULTS
human nek <dig> is predicted to be phosphorylated at various sites and has an unfolded short n-terminal domain
human nek <dig> amino acid sequence was analyzed considering its secondary structure, disordered regions, conserved motifs and putative phosphorylation sites by upstream kinases, resulting in a linear representation of its main structure predictions . these analyses were also performed for hnek <dig>  for which the crystallographic structure was recently determined  <cit> , in order to validate our results .

our consensus of secondary structure was scored by the number of times  the predicted secondary structure element  scored positive from five predictions using different databases: predictprotein/prof  <cit> , psipred  <cit> , sspro  <cit> , sopma  <cit>  and gor <dig>  <cit> . in summary, the secondary structure analysis suggested that hnek <dig> was composed of approximately 34% α-helices, 12% β-strands and 54% coils. our hnek <dig> consensus of predicted secondary structure is 80% identical to the author-approved secondary structure in pdb  .

in the case of the disordered regions predictions, our consensus was obtained following the same criteria as for the secondary structure predictions, except that we used here nine different databases: foldindex  <cit> , globplot russell/linding  <cit> , pondr vl-xt  <cit> , dispro  <cit> , iupred  <cit> , disembl hot-loops, disembl remark- <dig>  disembl loops/coils  <cit> , and vsl2b  <cit> . from this analysis, we were able to identify a short high scored segment of disorder covering the majority of hnek <dig> n-terminal extension before its catalytic domain, which we are calling here the regulatory domain. this characteristic is also present in our hnek <dig> consensus of disorder predictions and in its crystal structure  <cit> , where amino acids 1- <dig> are missing residues  and amino acids 20- <dig> are coils. notably, we found that hnek <dig> unfolded short n-terminal region is important to mediate interactions with diverse partners  <cit>  and, since hnek <dig> and hnek <dig> are similar in their catalytic domain sequences , but different in their n-terminal extensions  , it is possible that both proteins depend on their disordered n-terminal domain to regulate the interactions with specific/different partners.

for phosphorylation analysis, netphosk  <cit>  and netphos  <cit>  databases were used to predict phosphorylation sites , and together with in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation data  <cit> , they were used to assign tyrosine, threonine and serine residues as putative phosphorylation sites for hnek <dig> and hnek <dig> . this analysis shows a variety of high score phosphorylation predictions for hnek <dig>  interestingly, there are four predicted sites localized in hnek <dig> n-terminal domain , and one of them  also described to be phosphorylated in vivo  <cit> , suggesting that this is an important phosphorylation-regulated region.

secondary structure analysis
the secondary structure content of hnek <dig> was analyzed by circular dichroism  spectroscopy. figure  <dig> shows the cd spectra of recombinant wild-type hnek <dig> fused to a 6xhis-tag recorded at 4°c. purified protein presents negative ellipticity in the far-uv, with minima at  <dig>  and  <dig> nm . this spectrum is typical of many globular proteins  <cit>  and suggests a high content of α-helices, since this secondary structure is characterized by minima around  <dig> and  <dig> nm. deconvolution of the cd spectrum using the cdnn software  <cit>  indicated approximately  <dig> % of α-helices,  <dig> % of β-strands,  <dig> % of beta-turns and  <dig> % of random coils. deconvolution using another software, k2d  <cit> , indicated a similar amount of secondary structure elements: approximately 41% of α-helices, 17% of β-strands and 42% of coils. we also estimated the quantity of α-helix structure by the evaluation of the cd spectrum signal at  <dig> nm, according to corrêa and ramos,  <dig>  <cit> , resulting in  <dig> % of α-helices. compared to our predictions, wild-type hnek <dig> showed a very similar content of α-helices , β-strands  and coils . in conclusion, both the in silico prediction and the experimentally derived data are in reasonable agreement, since they demonstrate an expected high α-helical content for hnek <dig> 

comparative molecular modeling of human nek6
the absence of a three-dimensional structure of hnek <dig> and the increasing interest in studying nek proteins within the context of drug design strategies prompted us to construct a homology model for the aforementioned protein. here, we are interested in the activation loop mutant hnek <dig>  the activation loop is a centrally located loop, typically 20- <dig> residues in length, that provides a platform for the peptide substrate. activation of most protein kinases usually requires phosphorylation of a residue in this loop, which leads to a rearrangement of the loop and increase in enzymatic activity  <cit> . in hnek <dig>  s <dig> is an important residue, which phosphorylation leads to an increase in the activation status of the kinase  <cit> . the activation loop has the capacity to undergo large conformational changes when the kinase switches between inactive and active states, adopting distinct conformations in different kinases when they are inactive , a fact that has recently been exploited to great medical benefit  <cit>  and which makes our hnek <dig> mutant an interesting target to be studied.

to obtain a homology model of the hnek <dig> protein, the crystallographic structure of hnek <dig>  available in the protein data bank   <cit> , was used as a template. both proteins share about 77% identity in primary sequence alignment, being ~86% identical in their catalytic domain sequences . several homology/comparative modeling tools were used as described in the "methods" section of this article. in order to choose the best predicted model, stereochemistry quality analyses were done to check for φ and ψ torsion angles using the ramachandran plots. a comparison of the results indicated that the model generated by swiss-model  <cit>  is more acceptable than those generated by the other programs . the swiss-model homology model is shown in figure  <dig>  the ramachandran plot  showed  <dig> % residues in the most favourable regions,  <dig> % in additional allowed regions,  <dig> % in generously allowed regions and  <dig> %  in a disallowed region. as compared to the 2wqm template, these values were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. it is important to keep in mind that the template has relatively long regions  where the phases could not be solved by x-ray crystallography. consequently, the homology modeling may not be so accurate in these regions, although the high identity of the target-template sequences makes the whole model plausible. the results revealed that the majority of the amino acids are in a φ-ψ distribution consistent with right handed α-helix and reliable to be a good quality model . more details of the validation of the predicted structure results and its quality assessment using prosa  <cit>  are displayed in the additional material section . no abnormalities were observed in the validation process, which indicated a good model for the protein.

our hnek <dig> model generated by swiss-model  <cit>  shows a short region of α-helix composed of twelve residues  following the conserved dlg motif, with high score . a helical structure following the dfg/dlg motif is also present in hnek <dig> structures   <cit>  and in other kinase families, such as inactive forms of both the egfr kinase  <cit>  and src/hck  <cit> . therefore, although the activation loop is missing in the electron density map of hnek <dig>  a short helical structure is possibly present in hnek <dig>  which was predicted in the model generated by swiss-model  <cit> .

human nek <dig> is a monomeric mostly globular, though slightly elongated protein in solution, as revealed by saxs
to study hnek <dig> molecular structure, in addition to our homology modeling, we also performed saxs  experiments for the recombinant 6xhis-hnek <dig>  saxs is a very useful technique for the determination of overall size, shape and oligomerization status of the macromolecules in solution  <cit> . figure 4a shows the corrected and normalized experimental scattering curve and theoretical fitting of data by using the program gnom  <cit> . the guinier region providing an rg value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å is shown in the inset. the p function resulting from these calculations is shown in figure 4b, with an inset showing the kratky representation of the intensity curve. the kratky plot indicates a slightly globular conformation for 6xhis-hnek <dig> in solution, although, as expected, the same plot also indicated the presence of flexible regions in the structure, possibly the n-terminal region and the activation loop. the p function shows that the protein conformation is slightly elongated. the maximum dimension  value obtained was approximately  <dig> Å and the rg value calculated from the p function was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, in close agreement with that calculated from the guinier approximation. using bsa as a standard sample, the molecular mass of 6xhis-hnek <dig> estimated from the saxs data was ~ <dig> kda. this value indicates that the protein is a monomer in solution, since the theoretically calculated molecular mass of the monomer was ~ <dig> kda . the molecular mass and consequently the monomeric nature were also confirmed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering .

the low-resolution models obtained from the saxs data by the combination of ab initio calculation and rigid body modeling methods are presented in figure  <dig>  the calculated homology model of the mutant hnek <dig> was used in the rigid body calculation. we displayed two typical models of the set of results  and a superposition of all  <dig> models  obtained in different and independent runs of the program bunch  <cit> . in spite of the flexibility of the n-terminal region, the nsd values of the pairwise comparison of the models obtained ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , which shows the stability of the independent calculations. in order to further compare the resulting models with the information contained in the saxs curve, we also calculated one average molecular envelope of the  <dig> models  and compared with the filtered average models obtained from the two sets of  <dig> purely ab initio model calculations .

analytical size-exclusion chromatography reveals variations in human nek <dig> conformation dependent on its phosphorylation status
analytical size-exclusion chromatography  was performed for five variants of recombinant hnek <dig> fused to a 6xhis tag: wild-type hnek <dig> , activation loop mutant hnek <dig> , kinase domain of wild-type hnek <dig> ), and dephosphorylated wild-type and mutant hnek <dig> d). interestingly, the dephosphorylated wild-type and mutant proteins, which were co-expressed with lambda phosphatase, were eluted at equal elution volumes , showing the same stokes radius of ~ <dig>  nm, while the more phosphorylated wild-type hnek <dig> showed a larger radius of ~ <dig>  nm and the partially phosphorylated mutant hnek <dig> showed an intermediate radius of ~ <dig>  nm . as expected, 6xhis-hnek <dig> showed the smallest radius of ~ <dig>  nm. wild-type hnek <dig> elution curve also showed a smaller peak corresponding to a population of higher molecular weight, possibly due to aggregates. it is interesting to compare the stokes radius estimated by sec for 6xhis-hnek <dig>  with the radius of gyration determined by saxs . the resulting ratio rg/rs for this protein is ~ <dig>  and, as rg/rs ratios are reported to vary from  <dig>  for homogeneous spheres, up to values nearing  <dig> for extended coils and prolate ellipsoids  <cit> . this reinforces our results that hnek <dig> has a slightly elongated conformation, with a flexible unfolded n-terminal domain contributing to this shape.

sec was also coupled to mals , which is an useful technique to measure the weight average molecular masses  of the eluted proteins, as described in the methods section. as expected, wild-type and mutant hnek <dig>  dephosphorylated or not, showed a mw of ~ <dig> kda, while the kinase domain showed a mw of ~ <dig> kda . this corroborates our experimental data from saxs for 6xhis-hnek <dig> and the theoretically calculated molecular masses for all hnek <dig> variants, showing that hnek <dig> is a monomer in solution.

these results suggest that, although having the same molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda, wild-type hnek <dig> is purified from bacteria more phosphorylated than its mutant variant, mainly because of their different activation/autophosphorylation status, as described by meirelles et al.  <cit> , and these different phosphorylation degrees may cause changes in protein conformation and compactness, resulting in changes in their stokes radii. this was better visualized for both proteins when dephosphorylated by lambda phosphatase, which promoted smaller radii and, possibly, more compact or less hydrated conformations. it seems that an increase in phosphorylation induces a structural change that increases the apparent size or shape of hnek <dig>  in fact, in most kinases, the activation loop is phosphorylated when the kinase is active, which stabilizes it in an open and extended conformation that is permissive for substrate binding  <cit> . this phosphorylated extended conformation may therefore contribute to the increase in hnek <dig> stokes radius. all hnek <dig> variants were submitted to sec-mals twice, using two different buffers , and the same stokes radii for each protein were obtained in both measurements. figure  <dig> shows the results from sec-mals using the buffer containing  <dig> mm nacl, and tables  <dig> and  <dig> show all the results obtained from both measurements.

thermal denaturation shift assays were also performed for the five recombinant hnek <dig> variants described above. the results revealed a slightly higher stability of wild-type hnek <dig> compared to the activation loop mutant . this may be explained by the fact that, in many kinases, like pka, phosphorylation of the activation loop cause global stabilization of the active site  <cit> , and molecular dynamics simulation of cdk <dig> has demonstrated a decrease of b-factors throughout the molecule upon phosphorylation  <cit> . a model was proposed that dephosphorylation of the activation loop leads to mutual repulsion of the positive charges that were bound to the phosphate, which leads to the destabilization of the magnesium-binding loop, movement of the αc-helix out of the active site, disturbance of the hydrophobic spine, and loosening of the n-lobe, thereby providing an explanation of the protein kinase stabilization induced by phosphorylation  <cit> . this may therefore also reflect a higher stability for the wild-type hnek <dig> compared to its activation loop mutant in thermal melting measurements.

CONCLUSIONS
our data presents the first low resolution 3d structure of hnek <dig> protein in solution. saxs experiments show that hnek <dig> is a monomer of a mostly globular, though slightly elongated shape, which was also confirmed by analytical sec-mals experiments. these also showed that hnek <dig> conformation is dependent on its activation/phosphorylation status, a higher phosphorylation degree corresponding to a bigger stokes radius. thermal denaturation shift assays revealed a slightly higher stability of wild-type hnek <dig> compared to the activation loop mutant hnek <dig>
