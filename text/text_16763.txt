BACKGROUND
stromal cells are connective tissue cells that support the functional part of an organ. the fibroblast  is the prime representative of a stromal cell type. mesenchymal stem cells are adult, self-renewing multipotent progenitors that also inhabit the stromal compartment . a population of stromal cells that demonstrate stem cell capabilities liable to be isolated from the bone marrow and from other diverse human tissues , is what we know as the mesenchymal stromal/stem cell population   <cit> . specific traits that lead to the separation of uncommitted stages from differentiated ones are not yet conclusively deciphered. nevertheless, the expanded settlement along the body of mscs, the easiness of in vitro culturing, their differentiation capabilities, and their contained immuno-modulatory capacities have empowered them to be used in regenerative medicine for restoring the matrix or cellular elements of damaged tissues or for diminishing inflammatory or immune reactions. for these reasons, the mscs have been also included in many recent cell therapy trials  <cit> .

cellular phenotypes can be defined by the expression and active contribution of specific genes. therefore, many genome-wide profiling studies have been undertaken to answer unresolved questions over specific cell types. in the case of human mscs, differentially expressed genes have been explored in pioneering studies by wagner et al.  <cit>  using global gene expression profiling. different probe methodologies and discrepant experimental and analytic protocols interfere in the comparison between separate reports. however, as technology has been progressing, cell gene signatures have improved in sensitivity and specificity.

to characterise the specific identity features of mscs, we took advantage of multiple accessible transcriptomic data gathered from different cell types with different degree of commitment. at the same time, we undertook a de-novo study based on new experimental data, generated to investigate the nature of mscs and the inherent changes associated to their different tissue origins, variability that tissue-mscs retain even during the first culture expansion stages  <cit> . as a whole, the data collection produced to feed the performed study included  <dig> samples selected from public databases, a self-produced dataset of  <dig> samples analysed with high-density exon microarrays, and an additional set of six samples analysed with rna deep-sequencing technology. the construction of a large transcriptomic framework of human stromal cells, together with their most related cell types, have facilitated to identify the relative differences and similarities between them.

analysing the global gene expression profiles with a robust approach, we have been able to identify a polished signature comprising the common msc lineage features in a set of  <dig> up-regulated genes. functional linkage among signature genes also established the basal mesenchymal routines that cells normally trigger in their lifetime. specific genes associated to each tissue were also scrutinised, specially the cytokine and the cd patterns. we have further explored the transcriptome of the bone marrow population of mscs  and investigated the potential interactions with their niche-mates, the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells . the exchanged signals and cross-talk interactions between these two, determines the establishment of the functional bone marrow microenvironment. finally, by overlapping the results of our extensive data-driven exploration with other published signatures in a state-of-the-art compendium, we rescued genes that appear frequently reported, underlying the value of the mscs characterisation presented.

RESULTS
cytological variations of stromal cells from different origins
primary cultures of stromal cells isolated from different origins included: mscs from adipose tissue , mscs from bone marrow  and mscs from placental tissue ; as well as fibroblasts  from dermal tissue. under the microscope, the fibroblastic spindle-shape of stromal cells appeared clearly manifest along the study cultures . some peculiarities in cell morphology may certainly be appreciated between stromal cells from different tissue origins. the placental mscs were the longest, similar to fibroblasts. bm and ad-mscs were difficult to distinguish and had a more irregular morphology in culture, with cells that mixed fusiform shapes with less elongated star shapes.fig.  <dig> characterization of mscs following the isct criteria. a microscope photographs of human stromal cells in culture taken at passage three: phase contrast micrographs seen at 4× and 10×. b-c analysis of population doubling times: b boxplot of the doubling time distributions per stromal cell culture; c wilcoxon test results of contrasted doubling times between stromal types. . labels for stromal cell types: ad = adipose tissue msc; bm = bone marrow msc; pl = placental msc; fib = dermal fibroblasts. **significant p-values under  <dig> . d-e boxplots of normalized scatter intensities collected from flow-cytometry immunophenotyping assays using  <dig> different markers: cd <dig>  hladr, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig>  




in terms of cell growth rates, population-doubling times were significantly shorter on fibroblasts, followed by pl-mscs and later ad- and bm-mscs. between these last two, no significant differences were found. wilcoxon test p-values point out the differences in growth rate between cultures . the complete data collected from cultures is available in additional file 1
.


the intensity of standard cd markers detected by flow cytometry assays in different stromal cells is presented in comparative boxplots in fig. 1d. cd <dig> showed the strongest signal and, strikingly, the highest in fibroblasts and the lowest in pl-mscs among the cellular classes. cd <dig> together with cd <dig> resulted the most discriminating for fibs from the rest of the msc populations. of less variability resulted cd <dig>  been similar to ad- and bm-mscs, and expressed stronger in pl-mscs and fibs. cd <dig> showed similar expression along all cell populations. forward scatter and side scatter measures also denoted differences . these cytometric parameters showed that fibroblasts are the smallest and less internally complex cells.

. confirmatory microscopic snapshots of tri-lineage differentiations of the three tissue-mscs are also supplied in additional file  <dig>  to address the transcriptomic study of all these cell types, the produced and verified primary cultures of stromal cells were used to generate an in-house de-novo gene expression dataset.

meta-analysis of multiple sample series of mscs and other related cell types
to begin the identification of human mesenchymal stromal cells, we first searched in multiple public databases to find a collection of datasets that could be assembled and analysed in a common framework. in this way, we integrated several transcriptomic data series and carried out a meta-analysis study on them. we first explored the genome-wide expression profiles to better visualise the relationships of mscs to differently related cell types: from same lineage derived osteoblasts, adipoblasts, chondroblast or fibroblasts, to lineage flipped hematopoietic progenitors  and differentiated cells , and cells from foetal origin.

the meta-analysis study approach allows increasing the number of samples available, thus improving the robustness of the results. in our case, a meta-set of  <dig> expression microarrays from  <dig> independent data series were selected through a discriminating process that included a total initial collection of more than  <dig> samples . a benchmark of several biological backgrounds was created, including samples from the mesenchymal lineage, together with samples from the hematopoietic lineage. cells from the hematopoietic system presented a well-characterised immunophenotype that defined each cellular population along the maturation process. this brought a well-known system that served as distant control group to compare the less phenotypically characterised cells from the stromal lineage. differentiated cells of both lineages, even from unrelated tissues, were included whenever available, to provide a broader profiling.

the transcriptomic profiles produced provide a view of the relationships between cells, considering differences and similarities as distances or proximities that the cells exhibit, associated to the functional backgrounds they come from. a non-supervised hierarchical clustering analysis of global expression, based on pearson correlations, is represented in the heatmap in fig. 2a. the heatmap shows that hematopoietic  and mesenchymal  lineages fall clearly separated in two main clusters. samples from foetal origin, included inside both lineages, are segregated from their other relatives. in this way, the distribution of samples is primarily associated to the cellular lineage, as well as their differentiation state and tissue of origin. a very similar biologically distributed clustering is preserved when performing a principal component analysis . information contained in the principal components is exposed in fig. 2b and c. a 3d plot in fig. 2b displays the distribution of  <dig> samples within the space of the three first components of the pca using genes as variables. the cumulative variance explained by these three components is  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. a meaningful reading of these pca results is the agreement between the unsupervised clusterisation –based on the whole genome expression– and the biological cell types studied. the main variance accumulated in the first pc primarily explains the cellular lineage variation. the second and third pcs further explain the cell type specificity intrinsic to each lineage. using samples as variables, another pca was done and the cumulative variance explained by the first components was: pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc1 + pc <dig>  <dig> % and pc1 + pc2 + pc <dig>  <dig> %. the biplot presented in fig. 2c shows the two principal components representing 88% of the variability. thus, pc <dig> and pc <dig> account for the main separation between the two types of cellular lineages: stromal cells in one part and hematopoietic cells in the other. the coherence with biology of sample distributions also manifests that batch-effects are not relevant in the data. thus, the pre-processing and normalisation steps have been well accomplished, making the collection suited for upcoming differential expression comparisons and further integrative analysis .fig.  <dig> meta-analysis of mscs and related cell types. a sample-to-sample heatmap of  <dig> microarrays that includes mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineage cells. clustering of samples relies upon euclidean distances derived from the pairwise calculation of the pearson correlation between the expression vectors of each sample. in the right panel: the hematopoietic lineage samples are shaded in red and mesenchymal lineage samples are in yellow. the colour scale represents shorter to larger distance: from dark red to dark blue. b 3d plot of pca based on the gene expression of the stromal and hematopoietic cells studied. each dot represents a sample microarray from the repertoire of  <dig> and includes the global gene expression for each sample. c

clustering and pca analyses performed over the global expression profiles show that the transcriptomes appear associated by their biological context of origin, with a clear segregation between the hematopoietic cell lineage and the mesenchymal cell lineage, as well as clear proximity of the different cell types assigned to the mesenchymal lineage: adipoblasts, chondroblasts, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. an interesting result is the way differentiated cells cluster with respect to the progenitor cells. lymphocytes get a position separated from their hematopoietic progenitors. however, fibroblasts do not appear very much segregated from other stromal cells in this comparison, and mesenchymal samples gather closer than the samples from hematopoietic cells. this proximity occurs even considering that most of the mscs included here come from the bone marrow; however fibroblasts come from the dermis, two distant tissues that do not seem to mark as important differences in terms of whole gene expression as the distance observed between the stromal and the hematopoietic progenies.

with respect to the samples of foetal origin, in the case of hspcs there is a clear difference between the foetal and adult origin, but in the case of mscs the expression profiles are much less different . the larger difference observed in the case of hspcs should be expected, since it is known that human foetuses have a different hematopoiesis to adults because prenatal hematopoietic stem cells are formed in multiple anatomical sites , and they only colonise the bone marrow at birth to establish a normal hematopoiesis during postnatal life. in this way also, the lymphocytes and the immune system are still not fully developed in the embryonic stages and foetal erythrocytes express several specific proteins, like “foetal haemoglobin”, that are not present in adult blood.

transcriptomic homology between mscs from different tissue origins, fib and hspcs
since the first descriptions of mscs in the bone marrow  <cit> , many tissues have been disclosed as sources of mscs: muscle, skin, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood, wharton’s jelly, placenta, etc. we focused the following analyses to the characteristics that the different tissue basements confer to mscs. we produced an in-house genome-wide expression dataset with mscs from three different tissue origins. the platform affymetrix human exon  <dig>  was used since it allowed the expansion of the range of gene loci assayed from ~17 k  to ~20 k genes.

cultured populations of mscs from adipose tissue , bone marrow  and placenta  were submitted to genome-wide expression profiling, together with skin fibroblasts  and hspcs as contrast cell types. as shown in the preceding results, fibroblasts present a close relationship to the populations of mscs and the rest of the stromal lineage cells. on the other hand, hspcs provide a different lineage contrast related to stem cells, but not to the mesenchymal lineage.

principal component analysis of the  <dig> samples  reproduced the behaviour observed in the meta-analysis: clear segregation of hspcs from the mesenchymal lineage, and close association of fibroblasts to the rest of the mscs from the three different tissues. the cumulative variance explained by the  <dig> components here represented was:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %. in addition, another pca including only mscs and fibroblasts reveals a clearer separation of the cell types, showing the fibroblasts in a most-compacted cluster with less sample-to-sample variability than the rest of the mscs . the cumulative variance explained in this case was: pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc1 + pc <dig>  <dig> % and pc1 + pc2 + pc <dig>  <dig> %.fig.  <dig> analysis of tissue-mscs in a de-novo dataset of  <dig> microarrays. a 3d plot of pca performed for samples of all the cells under study  using the whole gene expression profiles. b 3d plot of pca performed only with the stromal cell samples  removing the hematopoietic cells. c heatmap of semi-supervised clustering based on the  <dig> cd marker genes. 




to observe the system through a narrower window, we performed a semi-supervised clustering analysis considering only the collection of  <dig> cd genes, defined as clusters of differentiation targetable for cell immunophenotyping . these known cell surface marker proteins allow the display of cell relationships focusing on the currently available phenotypical knowledge. the corresponding dendrogram in the upper margin of the heatmap  shows that the cellular entities were well segregated, the replicates were not mixed with each other, whilst the three subtypes of tissue-mscs were closely clustered. interestingly, bm-mscs and not fibroblasts are the first population more separated within the stromal repertoire when cd markers are used for sample clustering. analysis of the samples clustering based on all-genes  indicates that bm-mscs are within the tissue-mscs cluster . these broad clustering analyses based on the whole genome-wide expression profiles show only the main trends, but deeper analysis of the specific genes activated in each cell type and subtype should be performed to achieve better definition of stromal cells phenotype and understand their similarities to other cells.

differential expression  signatures that define tissue specificity of mscs
going further within the transcriptomic profiling and as a way to evaluate the similarity between mscs, we tackle the idea of establishing the number of differentially expressed  genes as a measurable value of cell population distances. first, we present the results derived from the meta-analysis of  <dig> samples obtained from  <dig> different published datasets, that included a collection of  <dig> bm-msc samples . these analyses were done using a re-sampling method  that allows finding the most stable differential expression gene signatures. three main contrasts were designed to compare bm-mscs against other cell types:  bm-mscs versus hspcs,  bm-mscs versus skin fibroblasts, and  bm-mscs versus osteoblasts. a summary describing all these comparisons and the de outcomes is included in additional file  <dig>  this approach yielded a value of  <dig> de genes between bm-mscs and fib, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated in bm-msc. the contrast between bm-mscs and hspcs yielded  <dig> de genes . as expected, broadly used msc markers cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were found up-regulated along the listed genes. table  <dig> presents  <dig> cd marker genes found in the complete list of significant genes. when we crossed lists of up-regulated genes in bm-mscs from both contrasts , one cd marker gene  and two transcription factors  remained in the intersection. the mcam glycoprotein gene  has been postulated as a marker of mscs population in the sub-endothelial niche within the bone marrow  <cit> .table  <dig> cd marker signature defined for bm-mscs

to better prove the value of the differential expression signatures obtained, we used again the re-sampling tool to perform exploratory tests upon some training samples of the microarray collection. unrelated mesenchymal samples following osteogenic induction, either in vivo or using certain effector molecules, were submitted to the re-sampling process . these re-sampling analyses yielded inconsistent numbers of differentially expressed genes between conditions, with no significant outcome in some cases . such anomalous results could be due to the comparison of very similar cell types –that would not have any significant gene change– or the comparison of very heterogeneous and disperse cellular states. the heterogeneity could come from stochastic responses to the different stimulus that were applied to the stromal cells studied  . these results prove the high sensitivity of the method to sample alterations, and, thus, the robustness to find the most stable genes in each differential expression contrast. this stability also adds value to the signatures obtained by re-sampling, i.e. the ones produced in the first and second contrasts .

an enrichment analysis directed to explore the functional and biological meaning of the differentially expressed genes in mscs is included in table  <dig>  when compared to hspcs, certain functions are enriched in the bm-mscs gene signature: blood vessel development, vesicle localisation, cell migration, cell death regulation. moreover, hematopoiesis and leukocyte activation processes are enriched in hspc genes. significantly, in the comparison with fibroblasts, more bm-msc genes appear annotated to bone development tasks  and skeletal fibre organisation . by contrast, fibroblasts showed a clear enrichment in genes related to the organisation and function of the extracellular matrix.table  <dig> functional enrichment analysis of de genes obtained from the meta-analysis approach

differential expression  analyses were also performed in our in-house controlled dataset, which includes mscs from three different sources. figure 4a and b show two red-green heatmaps where the intensity increases proportionally to the number of de genes between each contrast performed. the upper panel  includes the hspcs, that are removed in the lower panel  to strengthen the comparisons between stromal cell types. in this comparison, the strongest differences were observed between pl-mscs against all other stromal cells. this result may reflect the foetal nature of the placental cells. the opposite occurs for ad-mscs, which show the lowest number of de genes. this may indicate that this cell subtype in the adipose niche needs to prompt fewer specific genes to perform their tissue-specialised tasks.fig.  <dig> differential expression analysis from the de-novo study of  <dig> microarrays. a heatmap of distances measured as the number of differentially expressed genes between each cell type. red scale accounts for up-regulated genes in the cell type labelled in the right panel; whilst green intensities represent down-regulated genes. the more intense the colour, the greater the distance between cell types involved. b same as a, but hspcs were removed to improve the visualisation of the differences between stromal cell types. c-d-e tables presenting the number of differentially expressed genes per pair-wise comparison, indicating the up-regulated genes in each type . f

the exact number of de genes for all the pair-wise comparisons are presented in three tables in fig. 4c, d, e. an additional contrast class, formed by the three tissue msc samples, is also included in these analyses. this ‘all-mscs’ class shows  <dig>  de genes against hspc, but only  <dig> de genes against fib. these numbers may be considered a distance measurement between the cellular entities studied. such values are similar and proportional to the measures obtained in the meta-analysis of public datasets, strengthening the reliability of our biological observations.

the described results bring forward the question of which genes might be specifically associated to each tissue origin of the mscs analysed. to withdraw the potential tissue specific genes, we extracted the common de genes of each msc class across different comparisons. intersections of de gene lists are presented in venn diagrams in fig. 4f, where we only include the genes that were up-regulated in the comparisons of the indicated cell type with the others, for example for ad-mscs:  <dig> genes versus pl-mscs,  <dig> genes versus pl-mscs and  <dig> genes versus fib. from all these intersections we observed that, proportional to de values, pl-mscs present the largest list of tissue specific genes and ad-mscs the shortest:  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, differentially expressed in all the comparisons against the rest of stromal cells. these genes encountered in the intersections will be very specific to each tissue-msc. the lists corresponding to these genes are provided in table  <dig>  some genes found are: vcam <dig>  in bm-mscs; ncam <dig>  and dnam <dig>  in pl-mscs; ppapdc1a in ad-mscs ; twist <dig> and twist <dig> in fib   <cit> .table  <dig> tissue specific gene signatures: list of genes appearing differentially expressed in each tissue-msc and fibroblasts when contrasted to each other

cytokine-receptor mapping based on expression patterns
tissue-repair processes mediated by mscs has been proven in many cases as an effect of secreted growth factors, cytokines, and other signalling molecules  <cit> . cytokines have the capacity to trigger the signalling cascades from cell-to-cell within a tissue. the data presented in this work allow us to study the expression patterns of cytokines along populations of tissue-mscs.

within the bone marrow niche, cytokines forge the interactions within the two major inhabiting stem cell populations: hematopoietic and stromal. using our meta-analysis data frame, we have looked for cytokines among the genes up-regulated in bm-mscs and in hspcs, and mapped them over the cytokine to cytokine-receptor interactions . in fig. 5a, several mesenchymal-to-hematopoietic crossed interactions from the kegg pathway have been represented .fig.  <dig> cytokine expression patterns of mscs. a cytokine interactions between bm-mscs and hspcs. differentially expressed cytokines in bm-mscs  and hpcs  were coloured over the interaction map, highlighting the potential interactions established between the two cell types in the bone marrow. a complete mapping over the cytokines kegg pathway can be seen on additional file  <dig>  b heatmap clustering of microarrays samples based on the cytokinome intensity patterns. a gene cluster has been selected per stromal cell class. stars denote double positive cytokines also found in the intersection of the corresponding differential expression contrasts




the search across the meta-analysis dataset yielded  <dig> cytokine genes among  <dig>  bm-msc up-regulated genes . within the same dataset,  <dig> cytokines were found among  <dig>  hspc up-regulated genes . interestingly, hspcs showed expression of a greater bunch of cytokines than mscs, which were named cytokine ‘drugstores’  <cit> . previously described critical interaction pairs, like cxcl12–cxcr <dig> or kitlg–kit, were present in our interaction map. from the set of  <dig> bm-msc cytokines found in the meta-analysis,  <dig> appeared also differentially expressed in the comparison of bm-mscs versus hspcs in our de-novo study. these cytokines are: acvr <dig>  bmpr1a, bmpr <dig>  ccl <dig>  il13ra <dig>  osmr, pdgfrb, tgfbr <dig>  tnfrsf11b, tnfrsf12a and vegfc.

going further, we wanted to identify the potentially tissue-specific cytokines of each stromal cell subtype. we applied a hierarchical semi-supervised clustering analysis over the cytokine panel using the expression profiles of the  <dig> stromal samples from the de-novo dataset. figure 5b accounts for the 50% most variable cytokines across all sample classes. clusters showing predominant expression in just one class of stromal cells, according to their tissue of origin, have been highlighted. for the bone marrow, cytokines cxcl <dig> and lepr lead the profile of a 7-gene cluster. associated to the placental tissue, the cytokine pattern highlights tnfsf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and pdgfc. finally, kit and bmp <dig> genes resulted over-expressed factors in the skin-derived fibroblasts.

mesenchymal lineage expression core signature
the hematopoietic cellular element , present in both transcriptomic datasets studied, is the common non-mesenchymal element of the cellular populations analysed. we have used this out-of-lineage population as contrast group to generate a mesenchymal lineage expression signature. genes found up-regulated in each comparison of the tissue-mscs  against the hspc set were matched together . common genes up-regulated in all mscs versus hspcs were selected, obtaining  <dig>  shared by the three tissue-mscs included whithin the in-house dataset. from this signature,  <dig> genes overlapped with the bm-msc up-regulated genes from the meta-analysis and with the previously characterised msc gene footprint defined by our group using rna-seq  <cit> . therefore, we can consider this set of  <dig> genes as the most conservative core of differentially expressed genes in mscs, i.e. the genes that compose a well defined “mesenchymal lineage expression signature” .fig.  <dig> mesenchymal lineage signature. a venn diagrams showing the cross-flow of differentially expressed genes from the three approaches presented that contrast mscs to hspcs. colour code for tissue-mscs: bm , pl , ad . b summary table of enrichment in biological terms : metagroup refers to a functional cluster that gathers functionally associated genes from the mesenchymal lineage signature. the same mg colour code is applied in the network. the value silhouette width measures the closeness between biological terms within each metagroup. the higher the silhouette width, the more closely related are the metagroup terms. p-values give the enrichment significance to each metagroup. c functional network. ball-nodes represent genes. links represent functional association between genes based on shared biological annotations. squared nodes represent the metagroups of genes sharing functional annotations. conservation information per gene  has been implemented under a yellow-blue scale, from less to highly conserved scores, respectively




as significant elements that support the value of the signature, we can highlight some of the mesenchymal specific genes included in it: stromal standard biomarkers thy <dig>  and nt5e , transcription factor snai <dig> , several collagen molecules involved in the stroma , and the bmp receptors  involved in the differentiation and specification of mesenchymal precursor cells. moreover, together with snai <dig>  this msc lineage signature includes  <dig> other transcription factor genes: arid5b, creb <dig>  epas <dig>  fhl <dig>  gtf2e <dig>  gtf2ird <dig>  id <dig>  lmo <dig>  taf <dig>  tead <dig>  tulp <dig>  and znf <dig> 

biological processes prompted by these  <dig> genes were unravelled applying functional enrichment analysis tools. the geneterm-linker functional analysis tool provided a non-redundant clustering of biological terms to which the signature genes were annotated. the table in fig. 6b shows a summary of the results . nine clusters of enriched biological terms and functions  were found. significantly, functions related to bmp signalling, osteoblast differentiation, mesoderm formation, collagen fibril organization and extracellular matrix structure, appeared among the biological enriched annotations.

to validate the generated mscs signature, we performed another principal component analysis over our de-novo produced dataset of  <dig> microarrays  using only the  <dig> genes included in the mesenchymal lineage expression core signature . the outcome of this pca shows a cumulative variance explained by the genes in the first  <dig> components of: pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc <dig>  <dig> % ; and a cumulative variance explained by the samples in the first  <dig> components of: pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc <dig>  <dig> %, pc <dig>  <dig> % . these two figures show that the separation between hematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages is more strongly marked compared to the previous pca done with the whole transcriptomic signal using the  <dig> meta-analysis microarray dataset . the plots also show that the pca based on the  <dig> genes of the mscs signature provides much better separation between the cell subtypes than the pca based on the whole gene expression signal of the  <dig> exon microarray samples of this study . clusters are better defined now, and pc <dig> allows an evident separation of the stromal cell samples, including a  <dig> % explained cumulative variance. moreover, the fibroblast samples come apart in a cluster separated from the tissue-msc samples. this is an interesting new perspective, considering that the analyses previously performed with the whole transcriptome in different sample sets were not able to provide such clear segregation.

mscs functional gene network
we built a functional network founded on the metagroups recruited from the enrichment analysis  for better analysis and visualisation of the meaningful associations between the  <dig> msc genes. genes are linked to the metagroups in which they are annotated; in other words, the graph displays clusters of genes sharing similar biological annotations and functional roles  <cit> . genes  linked by edges to metagroups  reflect the membership to a specific functional group and show the sharing of common biological roles with other genes. in this bipartite network, the metagroups act as hubs denoting integrative roles within the mesenchymal core signature. some metagroups can share many genes with others, but other metagroups are more exclusive. in this way, a general overview of this functional gene network  indicates that the first metagroups , include more specific mesenchymal-stromal functions , and appear more detached to the rest of functional metagroups. by contrast, mg <dig> and mg <dig>  are more promiscuous, with greater overlap and many edges cross-linking multiple genes. the functional annotations for these metagroups are more diffuse or general .

regarding the genes, some are included in many functional metagroups, as itga <dig> , revealing a more central role. in fact, this gene is connecting five metagroups in the network: mg <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cd49e fibronectin receptor is known as essential for the cell attachment to the extracellular matrix ; but, intracellularly, it is involved in the formation of adhesion complexes with cytoskeleton proteins and in the activation of kinases that regulate signaling of growth, division, survival, differentiation, migration or apoptosis. the multiple regulatory functions that this protein integrates endorsed the network position that it presents. likewise, another gene central element is the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase , which is found as acting as connection point for several metagroups: mg <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this enzyme lies upstream of the map kinases pathway and is essential for signal transduction. other genes connecting more than two metagroups in the network are: actn <dig>  gja <dig>  ilk, myof, pdgfrb, pdlim <dig>  rab2a, sort <dig>  vcl.

to add another layer of information, we also investigated whether genes connecting separate functions within this mesenchymal lineage network  might present higher or lower evolutionary conservation. to achieve this, we incorporated sequence conservation information, based on the exonic coding regions, to each gene of the functional network. additional file  <dig> contains the calculated conservation scores of the complete list of genes. in the network, the conservation is displayed as the node colour, scaled from orange to blue, from least to most conserved genes, respectively. as a whole, we observed that the less conserved genes  belong only to one functional metagroup , but the most conserved are usually connected to several functional metagroups . this is a trend consistent with the idea that conserved genes may be more multi-functional, since they are more ancient and can acquire new roles along evolution. for example, we identified cask as a highly conserved gene that links mg <dig> and mg <dig>  this gene encodes a membrane-associated calcium/calmodulin-dependent guanylate kinase . the known functions of cask indicate that it is a scaffold transduction protein located at synapses in the brain that contributes to neural development, maintains the morphology of neuron dendritic spines, and regulates cellular interactions at the presynaptic site. it is clear that this protein detected in mscs will have other functions in the stromal niche, showing that it is a multi-functional gene. among the less conserved genes we found, for example, cdkn2b, cdc42ep <dig>  ccl <dig>  lamp <dig>  sts and thy <dig> . the presence of the mscs marker cd <dig> in this list might indicate that more recently evolved genes may also be more specific within the mesenchymal signature.

mscs gene coexpression network
the network presented in fig. 6c corresponds to a functional gene network derived from the enrichment analysis perforrmed with the  <dig> gene signature obtained for the mscs. to complement this network analysis, we also built a coexpression network derived from the transcriptomic data, i.e. from the expression values of the  <dig> genes along the exon arrays in  <dig> samples of the different cell types studied . we calculated the coexpression using the pearson correlation, and we applied a stringent cutoff to select the pairs with correlation coefficient r ≥  <dig>  to identify the most correlated gene pairs. we provide an additional file  <dig> presenting this network. in this analysis, we highlight the genes that correspond to known cd markers  and to transcription factors  to better illustrate possible interesting links. some genes like the receptors fgfr <dig> and pdgfrb are highly connected in both networks , indicating that they are relevant to the nature of the mscs. to allow a more detailed exploration of the coexpression network built, we provide a cytoscape file that includes all the interactions derived from the correlations and it incorporates  <dig> genes and  <dig> interactions .

figure 6a presents the genes detected as commonly overexpressed  in the contrast of all the mscs versus the hspcs, which provided an intersection set of  <dig> genes. as a contrast to this common set, we also investigated the genes and gene functions that were specific to each subtype of msc. to do this, we selected the genes found overexpressed in each tissue-msc when compared with the other stromal cell types. these comparisons provided:  <dig> genes for ad-mscs,  <dig> genes for bm-mscs and  <dig> genes for pl-mscs; and correspod to the gene lists derived from the union of the data represented in the venn diagrams in fig. 4f. these three gene lists were submitted to a functional enrichment analysis to identify their biological meaning using david functional enrichment tool . a first view of these results , shows that these lists include genes that correspond to a set of common biological terms: signal peptide, extracellular matrix, glycoprotein and secreted protein; that correspond to functions that are enriched in all the tissue-mscs but not in fibroblasts, indicating that these cells have a tendency to produce much signaling and secreted proteins, often present in the extracellular matrix. looking for more specific functional profiles, we observed that ad-mscs and bm-mscs showed a strong enrichment for terms like skeletal system development or embryonic skeletal system development, that indicate a closer association with bone differentiation and skeleton maintenance. we also observed that homeobox genes  were highly present within these functional annotations, together with other genes like: acvr2a, alpl, gas <dig>  mgp, tgfb <dig>  tgfb <dig>  tgfbr <dig>  several of these genes are related to calcium homeostasis and bone morphogenesis or to growth and differentiation in specific cellular contexts; highlighting the functional similarity of the mscs coming from bone marrow or adipose tissue.

overlapping with other reported mscs gene signatures
once we analysed human msc expression profiles and outlined several stromal cell-, tissue- or lineage-associated gene signatures, we searched public databases and publications to find which genes were previously reported using similar approaches. in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  several human msc transcriptomic studies have been summarised, and the reported msc gene signatures ordered and compared to the outcomes of our study. the overlapping proportions with different datasets are variable, but the similarity is rather significant, being aware of the technological chages along time, the differences in expression platforms as well as the use of different data handling protocols. in this way, we found several genes included in our mscs lineage signature that repeatedly appeared in gene lists produced in similar published works. table  <dig> presents a featured overview of the overlap of the mscs lineage signature proposed with other studies . some of the genes in these genesets are already known as phenotypical hallmarks of the mesenchymal identity, like the biomarker cd <dig> . others are known actors in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions: igfbp <dig>  ddr <dig>  lox, loxl <dig>  <cit> . another gene present in several of the published lists derived from msc studies is smurf <dig>  an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that seems to cooperate with smad <dig> in preventing myofibroblast differentiation via tgfbeta receptor destabilisation  <cit> . rhoc is another interesting gene product that encodes a member of the rho family of small oncogenic gtpases, and promotes reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton, thus regulating cell shape, attachment and motility. finally, plod <dig> is an enzyme that catalyses the lysyl-hydroxylation in collagen peptides, critical for the stability of inter-collagen crosslinks. all these biological functions are deeply related to the stromal cells niche supporting the value of the mscs lineage signature found.table  <dig> review of gene signatures previously published for mscs and comparison with the proposed msc lineage signature of  <dig> genes

as a contrast inside the stromal lineage, we also found genes that appear to be specifically associated to mscs but not expressed in fibs . these genes show interesting roles, for example: the family of hox regulatory factors  involved cell differentiation, cell adhesion/migration and cellular development; or several collagen molecules highly expressed in mscs . these contrasts also reveal specific up-regulated genes just in fibs, like kit, and genes of the mmp family  that were also found in the set of  <dig> genes that we assigned to be fibroblast-specific .

discussion
mesenchymal stromal/stem cells phenotyping
the term “mesenchymal stromal/stem cell” summarises a complex cellular entity that can be isolated from diverse tissues in the human body, sharing similar morphology, growth conditions, cytometric patterns and in vitro differentiation capacity. despite these parameters that have been agreed and standardised for mscs  <cit> , a detailed biomolecular profiling of this cell type is lacking; and it is common to find fluctuations in the identification of these cells and in the reports of gene or protein markers assigned to them. in fact, many research articles about their specific phenotypic markers have been published . multiple efforts have been undertaken to discover biomarkers that allow homogeneous isolation of these cells. despite these efforts, the field is still open to deeper molecular characterisation. in this work, we have conducted a broad genomic-based approach that provides a data-driven characterisation of the genes activated in the msc phenotype, reinforcing some already proposed knowledge and providing new insights inaccessible to previous procedures .

previous studies on primary stromal cells and the bone marrow niche
several relevant publications  have contributed to the characterisation of the cellular and molecular components of the bone marrow niches  where the hscs reside, proliferate, mobilise or differentiate. the main consideration we need to be aware of is the fact that all this information comes from experiments in vivo in “mice”. therefore, the advances of these reports cannot be directly extrapolated to the human bone marrow microenvironment. however, these studies are of broad interest to contextualise previously described interactions from mice into the human hematopoietic niche. we discuss these and other related studies that provide information about the transcriptomic profiling of mscs.

the highly expressed chemokine cxcl <dig> is a potent attractant and retainer of both hscs and mscs, critical for maintaining hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells  in a quiescent state. cxcl <dig> abundant reticular cells  were first shown to guide a depletion of hscs when the cxcl <dig> gene was knocked-down, as well as severely impair the adipogenic and osteogenic capacities of these stromal cells  <cit> . moreover, deletion of car cells reduces the number of b-lymphoid progenitors  <cit> . this hsc niche-related cytokine was shown as expressed in cd146+ perivascular mesenchymal cells in humans  <cit> , with capacity to generate osteoblastic cells and promote hsc maintenance.

niche cells for hsc maintenance are marked by nestin , an intermediate filament protein found in self-renewing mesenchymal stem cells   <cit> . nes+ cells express very high levels of cxcl <dig>  futhermore, pdgfrα+/sca1+  cells have been suggested to comprise bone marrow mscs  <cit> . in fact, the frequency of cfu-f, a hallmark of mscs, in prx1+ pαs cells is much greater than that reported for nes+ cells, suggesting that prx1+ cells are indeed mesenchymal progenitors  <cit> .

apart from highly expressing car cells and mscs, other stromal cells committed to osteogenic lineage or endothelial cells also express cxcl <dig>  though in lower levels. several studies have evaluated the functional impact of cxcl <dig> removal in different stromal populations of the niche  <cit> , thus defining distinct specialised niches for hsc maintenance, hsc retention, and the generation of certain lymphoid progenitors. deletion of cxcl12+ in osteoprogenitors  causes a significant reduction of t- and b-cell production, and fewer early lymphoid progenitors. leptin receptor  is present in perivascular sinusoidal stromal cells that express high levels of stem cell factor , which was previously reported as essential for hsc maintenance  <cit> . lepr is also involved in a novel hematopoietic pathway that is required for normal lymphopoiesis. another role has been suggested for cxcl <dig>  derived from lepr-marked cells, that was related to the retention of hscs rather than to their maintenance. this role comes from the observation that reduction of cxcl <dig> expression within the sinusoidal stromal compartment does not alter hsc or progenitor numbers, but induces the mobilisation of hscs and progenitors to the spleen and peripheral blood.

through analysis of the data generated by our work that showed overexpressed genes in different human tissue-mscs compared to hspcs, we can derive several interesting observations related to the markers identified in mice studies:  we show the presence of cxcl <dig>  lepr, kitlg in the specific expression of bm-mscs;  cxcl <dig>  but not lepr, was also overexpressed in ad-mscs;  pl-mscs did not show overexpression of cxcl <dig> or lepr;  pdgfa, pdgfc, pdgfrb and pdgfra are generally expressed in mscs from all the tissues studied;  rna-seq data showed a strikingly higher expression level of the nestin gene  in human pl-mscs compared to bm-mscs  <cit> .

consistent finding of cds to mark the mscs
the study of mscs in primary cultures implies the growth in heterogeneous populations with unknown proportions of differently committed cells. thus, expressed genes may strongly vary from culture to culture, setting the reason why signature or biomarker characterisation is sometimes irreproducible. in other words, it produces an increased rate of false positives in differential expression and a reduced true positive rate. the present work addressed these problems applying several strategies to solve them:  integration of multiple datasets including a large number of samples of our interest collected from different studies;  construction of an adequate cell biology framework with a well-distilled and contrast-minded sample cell types selection;  application of robust re-sampling techniques to find stable and reproducible signals. in this way, de genes yielded by the multiple analyses produced steady and reliable expression signatures. the genes selected may not be the most strongly expressed for a sample category in a single test. instead, they presented a rather constant differential expression pattern along the samples, significantly surpassing the iteraction tests. thus, despite possible variability in the samples, genes presenting subtle changes stable along samples, were preferably captured. proof of the methodology success is given by the retrieval of official msc cd marker genes  in the bm-msc signature .

cd <dig>  stands steadily over-expressed in bm-msc cultured populations when they are repeatedly compared to hematopoietic progenitors and dermal fibroblasts. analogous expression profiles had been observed by other molecular techniques and independent signatures  <cit> . covas et al.  <cit>  reported a close transcriptomic relationship between cd146+ perivascular cells from bm-mscs; also segregating them from fibroblasts, which did not expressed it. moreover, it has been observed that therapeutically applied bm-mscs preserve a population of cd146+ perivascular cells. another  <dig> cds out of the  <dig> listed in the bm-msc signature have been used as molecular markers for msc and other stem cells    <cit> . considering the correlation with previous knowledge, novel interest may be focused on the other highly confident cds presented in this work. these molecules may compose the distinctive body of cds available for bm-mscs .

the fibroblast in the stromal cell context
pedemonte et al. published an extensive transcriptomic study using mouse mscs and related cell types  <cit> . a collection of  <dig> microarrays from many tissues and cell types allowed the allocation of the mesenchymal lineage in a comprehensive panel of lineages. interestingly, the closest cell type that clustered with bm-mscs was the fibroblastic type . a transcriptomic-based study was also reported by chang et al., that provided an unsupervised comparative analysis and clustering of human fibroblastic populations obtained from different sites of the human body  <cit> .

the stromal cells studied here presented clear differences between them, attributed mainly to their tissue-linked origins. differences observed between the fibroblasts and the mscs categories are not large, although the fibroblasts are considered the stromal type with the highest expected degree of differentiation. this means that the msc populations that we are investigating, in terms of their trancriptome, are a much closer cell type to the fibroblast than initially expected. our flow cytometry data also supported the similar expression of cds between mscs and fibroblasts. this similarity has been previously reported  <cit>  and haniffa et al. even proposed that fibroblast and mscs are functionally equivalent  <cit> . controversial results about the differentiation potential of fibroblasts toward adipoblasts, chondroblasts or osteoblasts, keep the fibroblast cell under questioning . the work from alt et al.  <cit>  encountered human skin fibroblast cultures capable of differentiating and forming cfus in vitro. as the separation between mscs and fibroblasts seems small, we found more fruitful the contrasts of mcss isolated from different tissue origins against hspcs to extract a mesenchymal multilineage defining gene catalogue.

mesenchymal lineage signature
we collected the gene sets found to be up-regulated in mscs relative to hematopoietic stem cells from all of the performed contrasts:  the three contrasts from the tissue-specific mscs versus hspcs , and  the  <dig> re-sampled contrasts obtained through the meta-analysis approach of bm-mscs versus hspcs . these gene sets were analysed, to find the overlapping, and also compared with the genes found “on” in the mscs footprint   <cit> . following this integrative approach, we were able to delimit an expression core of  <dig> common genes that support and maintain the multipotency of the mesenchymal lineage. the functional enrichment of this msc gene signature indicates a strong osteogenic association of the genes, that has been postulated as the most frequently chosen path of the cellular commitment programs for mscs. moreover, it has been observed that the osteogenic potential capacity is lost the last when a progressive in vitro model of multipotency is established  <cit> .

charbord and colaborators  <cit>  defined a large gene signature  whose expression is associated to the support of the hematopoietic niche. this signature inluded most of the aforementioned genes related to the bone marrow niche. we compared the charbord signature with the up-regulated genes detected in each of our tissue-mscs . the number of genes matching each overexpressed gene-list was:  <dig> genes in ad-mscs,  <dig> in bm-mscs, and  <dig> in pl-mscs. this result indicates that the bm-mscs are the closest to the described hematopoietic niche, and are closely followed by ad-mscs and pl-mscs. however, a recent publication by reinisch and colaborators  <cit>  stated that only bm-mscs, and not other tissue-mscs, were capable of developing an endochondral ossification of human cells in a mice model that was preceded by the formation of a functional hematopoietic niche. our data may be compatible with this notion if we consider that just 4– <dig> genes can make a significant difference, although proper experimental testing with these genes will be the only way to prove the specificity of the bm-mscs versus other subtypes.

some genes derived from the network reconstruction
aided by the graphical view of a network, genes that behave like hub connectors of functions could be uncovered, opening the door to new potential regulators of the mesenchymal system. for example, sort <dig> gene  occupies a hub position between three functional metagroups that connect vesicle trafficking, tyrosine phosphorylation signalling and molecular processes usually altered in cancer . the protein encoded works as a sorting receptor in the golgi apparatus required for protein transport to the lysosomes. interestingly, it has been shown that sort <dig> promotes mineralisation of the extracellular matrix during osteogenic differentiation by scavenging the extracellular lipoprotein lipase produced by adipocytes  <cit> . this gene might be an actor of the fine equilibrium between differentiation paths.

transcription factors
transcription factors  are the principal regulators of fate decision. in the msc lineage signature we found  <dig> tfs: arid5b, creb <dig>  epas <dig>  fhl <dig>  gtf2e <dig>  gtf2ird <dig>  id <dig>  lmo <dig>  snai <dig>  taf <dig>  tead <dig>  tulp <dig>  znf <dig> . two of these tfs have enrichment in transcription factor binding sites  in the promoters of a significant number of targeted genes within the  <dig> msc signature: creb <dig>  and tead <dig> . tf snai <dig> has been largely documented as a central booster of mesenchymal phenotype, as occurs along emt processes   <cit> . snai <dig> transcriptionally represses expression of e-cadherin, but may act as an activator depending on the biological context. recently, it has been intricately related to osteoblast maturation through interaction over runx <dig> and cxcl <dig> promoters  <cit> . another nine factors are accompanying snai <dig> into this signature, including id <dig> . id <dig> is a helix-loop-helix  protein that can form heterodimers with other hlh proteins, thus preventing them to bind their target dna regulatory regions. it is known that id <dig> inhibits the skeletal muscle and cardiac myocyte differentiation by seclusion of e2a-complexes from e-box enhancer of muscle creatine kinase. in our data, id <dig>  together with pawr , was robustly overexpressed in bm-mscs relative to fibroblasts. pawr is a pro-apoptotic wt1-interacting protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor. pawr induces apoptosis by activation of the fas pathway, and co-parallelly by inhibition of nfkb in certain cancer cells, specifically prostate cancer. intriguingly, snai <dig>  id <dig> and pawr have been generally discovered by their function as transcriptional repressors.

tissue-specific msc genes
differences between stromal populations derived from various tissues are becoming more evident, and represent a source of heterogeneity within the mesenchymal phenotype. all stromal cells are essentially able to differentiate into the three mesenchymal fates in vitro, although they do not follow the same molecular paths. the cells seem to keep expression “memory” of source-specific genes that travel along during the differentiation process  <cit> . recent transcriptomic studies developed in murine endothelial cells from a plethora of tissues have also manifested the tissue-specificity of their molecular signatures, heterogeneity that is explained by their function in maintenance and regeneration of the different microenvironments  <cit> .

using our in-house dataset to contrast tissue populations against each other, we were able to describe a repertoire of tissue-specific genes from four tissue stromal populations: bone marrow, placental and adipose tissue mscs also in addition to dermal fibroblasts. curiously, ad-msc showed the lower numbers of differentially expressed genes in the comparisons with the other mscs, showing the smallest number of exclusively adipose tissue genes when compared to the rest of the stromal cells . these result resemble those found by jaager and co-workers  <cit>  , who suggested that the switch of stromal lineage to adipocyte-specific cell type require fewer genes than the switch to osteoblast- and chondrocyte-specific cell types. this apparently less specific msc could sustain a less functionally specialised msc in the adipose environment or possibly a more dormant cellular state.

going further in the tissue-specificity analysis, cd and cytokine patterns of stromal cells were also studied. cd <dig>  appeared overexpressed exclusively in bm-mscs. it has been long known that this marker is associated to bone marrow stromal cells. moreover, a population of human cells with overexpression of two genes, vcam1+/stro1++, have been shown to develop bone tissue in vivo following ectopic transplantation to mice  <cit> . vcam <dig> becomes down-regulated by cleavage during g-csf mobilisation of hspcs, conferring it an implied function in maintenance of the hematopoietic niches  <cit> . other transcriptomic reports have also listed cd <dig> as expressed in bm-mscs  <cit> . all these data pinpoint this gene as a bm-msc specific gene. beyond the bone marrow, other cd markers have been discovered for placental mscs; like for example cd <dig>  that has been previously linked to highly clonogenic mscs   <cit> .

another singular result from the tissue specificity analysis is the higher expression of twist <dig> and twist <dig> in dermal fibroblasts. the same outcome was previously associated to steady osteo-progenitor states of mscs  <cit> . twist <dig> and twist <dig> have been implicated in cell lineage determination and differentiation, therefore they may be up-regulated in more differentiated and committed stromal cells, as the fibroblasts are  <cit> . their strong presence in skin fibroblasts compared to other stromal types involves a role in fate determination and more probably in the restriction of other differentiation paths. in fact, low expression of these genes has been correlated with low osteogenic differentiation potential.

cytokines clustering around each tissue also defines the microenvironmental cues of specific signalisation. we found lepr gene is specifically expressed in our human bm-mscs. lepr is the receptor for leptin, an adipocyte hormone that regulates body weight through fat metabolism, and has a role in hematopoietic pathways. in mice, sinusoid-associated leptin receptor + cells maintain hspc perivascular residence in the bone marrow  <cit> . in this way, lepr+ stromal cells are key regulators of marrow homeostasis and the main bone producers in the adult mouse  <cit> . as far as we know, the expression of lepr in humans had not been explicitly reported before.

ccr <dig>  activation by ccl <dig>  as other receptor and cytokine partners found between hspcs and bm-mscs, mobilise monocytes during inflammatory responses and also seem to promote mobilisation of mesenchymal cells out of the marrow  <cit> . activin receptors acvr <dig> and acvr <dig> also appear to be expressed in mscs in the bone marrow. type i and ii receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding and transduce signals of bmps and other tgfbeta family members. a mutation in acvr <dig>  is causative of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a disease that progresses with heterotopic ossifications in muscles, tendons, ligaments and general connective tissues. the mutation confers constitutive activity to the bmp type i receptor and sensitises mesenchymal cells to bmp-induced osteoblast differentiation and bone formation  <cit> . as a new finding, the production of the inhibin ligand by hspcs  may be controlling the balance of differentiation of mscs toward osteoblasts. functional experiments are needed to unravel the interplay effects of this pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
many molecular studies have shed light into the origin, identity and function of stromal cell populations within the bone marrow, although most of the knowledge has been only assayed on mouse models. the bulk of human mscs currently in use for clinical therapies present a phenotype only partly described to date. through the data provided in this work and the analytic methods developed, we were able to obtain a detailed profile of the transcriptional phenotype of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells. relationships based on transcriptomic distances were explored among different tissue-stromal cells and with other non-mesenchymal related cell types. to extract the common traits of the inherently heterogenic population of cultured mscs from the bone marrow we applied a re-sampling protocol over a large integrated compendium of genome-wide expression data samples. we also extended the view to the interconnecting wires with hematopoietic housemates, performing a detailed comparison of the genome-wide expression profiles of mscs and hspcs. up-regulated genes in the mesenchymal lineage against the hematopoietic lineage yielded a signature of  <dig> genes. functional relationships were decrypted and potential regulatory genes of lineage commitment were postulated. genes proposed for markers of stromal phenotype have been revised, including those that are cd markers, cytokines or regulatory elements like transcription factors. tissue-specific gene expression sets associated to some stromal cell subtypes  were also uncovered. finally, all the gene signatures and profiles depicted in this work are provided open to new investigations that may expand the understanding of the mesenchymal cell biology.
