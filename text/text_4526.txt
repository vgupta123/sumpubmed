BACKGROUND
breast cancer, the most common neoplasm, is the leading cause of cancer-induced death in women worldwide  <cit> . surgery combined with adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, may have increased the patient survival rate in some way. unfortunately, advanced and recurrent breast cancer still has very poor prognosis due to the primary or secondary resistance to chemotherapy drugs. chemo-resistance that limits the therapeutic potential of anticancer drugs, resulting in failure of cancer treatment, still remains the main obstacle in terms of successful treatment of breast cancer  <cit> . therefore, novel effective attempts to overcome chemo-resistance are urgently needed in order to improve the outcome of patients with advanced and recurrent breast cancer.

the mechanism of chemo-resistance is very complex, but the overexpression of some atp-binding cassette  transporters and cancer stem cells, are two main causes of chemo-resistance .interestingly, recent studies have shown that sal-like  <dig>  gene, a member of the mammal homologs of drosophila homeotic gene spalt, is shared by stem cells with tumor cells promoting their proliferation and conferring drug resistance on them. sall <dig> gene maps to chromosome 20q <dig> in human and encodes zinc-finger transcription factor maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells through a variety of signaling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modulators . and sall <dig> gene mutations are known to cause okihiro syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease involving dysplasia of multiple organs  <cit> . in mice, sall <dig> homozygous knockout is embryonic lethal, and ma et al.  <cit>  reported that sall <dig> can function as an oncogene in leukemogenesis by using a transgenic mouse model with sall <dig> overexpression in most organs. thereafter, salll <dig> aberrant expression in hematopoietic stem cells, in the leukemic cells of aml patients, and in some solid tumors has been reported by various groups . up-regulating sall <dig> in cancer cells can promote their proliferative and invasive abilities. the overexpression of sall <dig> in tumor patients often correlates with adverse progression and poor prognosis. besides, the expression of sall <dig> is higher in drug resistant primary acute myeloid leukemic patients than those from drug-responsive cases. sall <dig> characterizes a feature of drug resistance through the maintenance of side population cancer stem cells and affects the side population cells by regulation of abc drug transport genes abcg <dig> and abca <dig> in leukemic cells  <cit> . in liver cancer, sall <dig> also enhances chemo-resistance by up-regulating abcg <dig>  <cit> . in endometrial cancer, however, sall <dig> promotes tumor chemo-resistance by activating c-myc to regulate mdr1/p-gp  <cit> . furthermore, silencing sall <dig> can enhance the chemo-sensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer drugs in liver cancer, endometrial cancer and lung cancer  <cit> . nevertheless, studies on the relation between sall <dig> and drug resistance and chemotherapeutic sensitivity in breast cancer are still lacking.

the human breast cancer resistance protein  is encoded by abcg <dig> gene and it is a member of the g subfamily of the large abc transporter superfamily  <cit> . mdr <dig>  also named abcb <dig>  encodes p-glycoprotein and it is one of the earliest abc transporters to be identified. the high expression of mdr <dig> was found in the majority of breast cancer tissues and human breast cancer drug-resistant cells  <cit> . p-gp and bcrp were considered to be responsible for the majority of drug efflux in human cancer. a rise in their expression had something to do with a poor prognosis in many types of cancer. c-myc gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved basic transcription factor and its overexpression is closely linked to chemotherapy resistance. in addition, overexpression c-myc can up-regulate the expression of bcrp in human mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . therefore, we are interested in determining whether p-gp, bcrp and c-myc are related with sall <dig> involved in chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer.

in this study, we confirmed that sall <dig> was overexpressed in the drug resistant cell line, mcf-7/adr, and we down-regulated sall <dig> gene in mcf-7/adr through the lentiviral-mediated short hairpin rna  interference system. then we examined the effects of sall <dig> in mcf-7/adr cells on proliferation and sensitivity to doxorubicin hydrochloride  in vitro and in vivo, and explored the possible molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, to provide experimental evidence for the potential application of sall <dig> gene as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.

cell cycle analysis
mcf-7/adr cells infected by the recombinant lentiviruses or not were inoculated into  <dig> well plates for 48 h. then, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in cold pbs, and fixed in 70 % ethanol at 4 °c overnight. next, the cells were washed and resuspended in cold pbs and incubated in a solution of 10 mg/ml rnase and 1 mg/ml propidium iodide  at 37 °c in the dark for 30 min. finally, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry . the percentage of cells in the g <dig>  s, and g2/m phases was determined using cell quest acquisition software .

experimental animals
this study was approved by the ethics committee of xinhua hospital of shanghai jiaotong university,school of medicine, china. female balb/c nude mice, 4–6 weeks old, were purchased from shanghai slac laboratory animal co., ltd. . the mice were housed in groups of five in specific pathogen-free conditions following the guidelines of laboratory animals and the ethics committee of xinhua hospital, affiliated to shanghai jiaotong university. to explore the effects of sall <dig> on tumor growth and drug resistance in vivo, mcf-7/adr cells  stably expressing lv-shrna suspended in 150 ul pbs were subcutaneously injected into the right axilla of the mice. on day  <dig>  these mice carrying xenograft tumor of mcf7/adr cells infected with lv-shsall <dig> were randomly divided into two groups . the first group received an intraperitoneally  injection of ns every 3 days and the other group were administered an i.p. injection of admh  every 3 days. simultaneously, these mice carrying xenograft tumor of mcf7/adr cells infected with lv-shnc were also randomly divided into two groups  and subsequently treated as the lv-shrna group. on day  <dig>  all nude mice were anesthetized with co <dig>  and the tumor tissue was excised from mice and weighed.

RESULTS
sall <dig> is overexpressed in chemo-resistant breast cancer cell line mcf-7/adr
to assess the role of sall <dig> in the drug resistant breast cancer cells, we detected the endogenous expression of sall <dig> in the normal mammary epithelial cell line hbl- <dig> and five breast cancer cell lines including mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  sk-br- <dig>  zr-75- <dig> and mcf-7/adr by qrt-pcr and western blot. mcf- <dig>  mda-mb- <dig>  sk-br- <dig> and zr-75- <dig> cell lines are sensitive to chemotherapy drugs such as anthracycline, taxane and so on. but mcf-7/adr cells are resistant to many drugs, despite the diversity in their chemical structures and mechanisms of action. and it was established from mcf-7cell line by exposing to adriamycin with stepwise increasing concentration  <cit> . the relative expression level of sall <dig> was significantly higher in mcf-7/adr cells compared with that in the other five cell lines . and the results of western blot of sall <dig> were consistent with the results of mrna . previously, gain- and loss-of-function studies have revealed that overexpression of sall <dig> was correlated with chemo-resistance in myeloid leukemia, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and liver cancer. taken together, these results illustrate that sall <dig> may also play an important role in regulating the resistance to chemotherapeutics in breast cancer.fig.  <dig> expression of the transcription factor sall <dig>  in breast cell lines. a mrna levels of sall <dig> expressed in the indicated cell lines were evaluated by quantitative real-time pcr . data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation  of at least three independent experiments. **p <  <dig> , when compared to mcf-7/adr cells; and b protein levels of sall <dig> were evaluated by western blot in the indicated cell lines



knockdown of sall <dig> inhibits cell proliferation
to explore the effects of sall <dig> on the chemo-resistant breast cancer, we established a lentiviral system expressing shrna to transfect mcf-7/adr cells. the transfection efficiency was confirmed by qrt-pcr  and western blot .sall <dig> mrna detection in the cells showed the shrna sequence targeting sall <dig> significantly inhibited sall <dig> expression compared with the con group . on the contrary, the negative control sequence  did not show statistically effect on the target gene . the results of western blot of sall <dig> also coincided exactly with the results of mrna. these data suggest that we have successfully down-regulated sall <dig> in mcf-7/adr cells by the approach lentivirus-mediated shrna interference.fig.  <dig> down-regulation of sall <dig> inhibits proliferation and changes cell cycle distributions in mcf-7/adr cells. a mrna levels of sall <dig> in the indicated cells were assessed by qrt-pcr ; and b growth curves of mcf-7/adr cells and c the relative proliferation rate of the cells with or without sall <dig> knockdown ; and d cell cycle distribution in percentages of different groups ; and e effects of sall <dig> on the mrna levels of cyclind <dig> and cdk <dig> genes. gapdh was used as the referral gene. ; and f the levels of indicated proteins, gapdh was used as the loading control, and the experiments were performed in triplicate



by comparing the growth curves of mcf-7/adr cells with or without sall <dig> knockdown, sall <dig> knockdown seemed to significantly inhibit the cell viability. the cell viability in sall <dig> knockdown group was significantly lower than that in the con group at the third day , and the inhibitory effect on cell viability became more obvious at the fourth and fifth day . the relative proliferation rate also indicated cell proliferation was markedly reduced in lv-shsall <dig> group since the third day when compared to the con group .but there was no observable difference between the con group and the lv-shnc group . according to those data, sall <dig> knockdown may exert a significant influence on mcf-7/adr cell viability and proliferation.

arresting cell cycle progression can inhibit the proliferation of cells  <cit> . to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of sall <dig> on the cell proliferation, we examined the cell-cycle analyses in mcf-7/adr using flow cytometry, and the results showed that knockdown of sall <dig> significantly changed cell cycle distributions in mcf-7/adr cells by increasing the percentage of cells in the g <dig> phase accompanied with reducing the percentage of cells in the s and g2/m phase , demonstrating typical cell cycle arresting at the g <dig> phase. in terms of all of the detected indices, there were no difference between the lv-shnc group and the con group . these findings are consistent with the previous reports that down-regulation of sall <dig> suppresses the growth of cancer cells and induces g <dig> phase arrest  <cit> . we also evaluated the levels of cycle-related proteins cyclind <dig> and cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  by qrt-pcr and western blot analysis. cyclind <dig> is one of the main factors in cell cycle regulation  <cit> , which binding with cyclin-dependent kinase, then leading g <dig> phase cells into s phase and promoting cell proliferation. a significant decrease of mrnas and proteins  was observed in mcf-7/adr cells in the target gene knockdown group , indicating that knockdown sall <dig> induced g <dig> phase arrest in these cells. these results suggest that sall <dig> has an impact on the proliferative activity of the resistant breast cancer cells through cell cycle arrest.

silencing sall <dig> re-sensitizes mcf-7/adr cells to admh in vitro
silencing sall <dig> in mcf-7/adr cells evidently enhanced its sensitivity to admh. as shown in the table  <dig>  the ic <dig> values of admh at  <dig> and 48 h in the lv-shsall <dig> group decreased from  and  umol/l to  and  umol/l, respectively. and ri also became apparently lower than that in the con group . besides this, a marked inhibition of colony formation ability was observed in the colony formation assay. the colony count and area were smaller in lv-shsall <dig> group . and the anova test indicated there was a synergistic effect of sall <dig> knockdown and admh treatment on inhibition of colony formation ability . the results mentioned above suggest that knockdown sall <dig> can re-sensitize mcf-7/adr cells to admh and reduce it growth.table  <dig> the analysis of the ic <dig> and ri of mcf- <dig> and mcf-7/adr cells towards admh

the cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs is associated with the dose which can be accumulated in the cells  <cit> . in order to investigate the potential mechanisms of sall <dig> and drug resistance of mcf-7/adr cells, we detected intracellular accumulation rate of admh in mcf-7/adr and parental mcf- <dig> cells. as shown in fig. 4a, c, a markedly higher intracellular accumulation of admh was observed in the cells of lv-shsall <dig> group compared with the con group . moreover, we also found that the intracellular accumulation of admh in the verapamil pretreated cells was higher in mcf-7/adr cells. but the admh accumulation rate was similar in parental mcf- <dig> cells with verapamil pretreated or not . furthermore, the anova test indicated that knockdown of sall <dig> had synergy with verapamil to increase admh accumulation rate in mcf-7/adr cells .we also investigated the effect of sall <dig> on membrane transporters, bcrp and p-gp, as well as c-myc by qrt-pcr and western blot. with sall <dig> knockdown, the expression of both c-myc and abcg2/bcrp in mcf-7/adr cells decreased significantly . but with sall <dig> knockdown, the expression of mdr1/p-gp only had a slight declining tendency, when compared to the con group . in other words, the function of abcg <dig> and c-myc in sall4-knocked-down mcf-7/adr cells was effectively inhibited, while the function of mdr1in sall4-knocked-down mcf-7/adr cells was not significantly inhibited. verapamil is a competitive inhibitor of both p-gp and bcrp, and they are abc trans-membrane efflux proteins sharing the ability to actively extrude drugs and toxins out of the cells, which may conduce to increasing the drug resistance in cancer cells. admh is the substrate of both p-gp and bcrp. the intracellular accumulation rate of admh will increase when anyone of the trans-membrane proteins is inhibited. in view of this, we assumed that the accumulation rate of sall4-knocked-down mcf-7/adr cells was higher than the cells without sall <dig> knockdown due to abcg2/bcrp down-regulation. and the accumulation rate of sall4-knocked-down mcf-7/adr cells was increased again by verapamil treatment caused by mdr1/p-gp inhibition. this was consistent with yhee et al.  <cit> , who reported drug accumulation rate increased in mcf-7/adr cells by p-gp inhibition. however, the results of mcf- <dig> cells were not in agreement with rogalska et al.  <cit> , who reported that doxorubicin accumulation rate in mcf- <dig> cells preincubated with verapamil increased higher. the reason for this difference probably was that the concentration, 5-umol/l of admh, was a supersaturated concentration for mcf- <dig> and the membrane transport proteins cannot continue extruding admh out of cells in our experiment. according to these data, we speculated sall <dig> conferred breast cancer cells on drug resistance, at least partly through manipulating abcg <dig> and c-myc genes. knockdown sall <dig> of mcf-7/adr cells can enhance intracellular admh accumulation, leading to a higher therapeutic effect of admh.fig.  <dig> admh accumulation rates of mcf-7/adr and mcf- <dig> cells and effects of sall <dig> on abcg <dig>  mdr <dig> and c-myc. a, b the intracellular accumulation of admh in the tested cells was analyzed by flow cytometry, and c, d the intracellular accumulation of admh in percentages of different groups. all data were from three independent experiments. **p <  <dig> , when compared to the con group; and e effects of sall <dig> on the mrna levels of indicated genes. gapdh was used as the referral gene. all data were from  <dig> independent experiments. **p <  <dig> , when compared with the con group; and f effects of sall <dig> on the levels of indicated proteins. results were representative of  <dig> independent experiments. gapdh was used as the loading control



sall <dig> down-regulation re-sensitizes drug-resistant tumor to chemotherapy in vivo
to investigate the effects of sall <dig> down-regulation on tumor growth and drug resistance in vivo, stroke-physiological saline solution  or admh  were intraperitoneally injected into nude mice carrying subcutaneous mcf-7/adr tumor every 3 days for up to 20 days. the tumors removed from these animals were shown in fig. 5a, and their mean weights were provided in fig. 5b. the results showed an obvious inhibition of tumor growth in mice with sall <dig> knockdown compared with the lv-shnc group . and the anova test indicated sall <dig> knockdown had potent synergy with admh to suppress the tumor growth in vivo . those were consistent well with the results of colony formation assay in vitro that knockdown of sall <dig> can reduce the chemo-resistance and proliferation of mcf-7/adr cells.fig.  <dig> knockdown of sall <dig> re-sensitizes the in vivo tumor to chemotherapy. a tumors were excised from the animals and photos of them were presented to show the sizes of the resulting tumors; and b tumors were weighed. ***p <  <dig> , when compared to the lv-shnc group



in order to increase the efficacy of breast cancer therapy, it is of great importance to identify candidate genes that are essential in cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance. sall <dig>  a stem cell factor plays vital roles in development and tumorigenesis. its expression has been previously linked with tumor treatment status and drug resistance. sall <dig> knockdown affects tumor growth in various malignancies including breast cancer. however, whether up-regulation of sall <dig> is related with chemo-resistance of breast cancer and the underling mechanisms remained unclear. in this study, using multidrug resistant breast cancer cells mcf-7/adr and its parental mcf- <dig> cells, we demonstrated that sall <dig> was overexpressed in mcf-7/adr cells. knockdown of sall <dig> in mcf-7/adr decreased its proliferation and induced g <dig> phase arrest accompanied by down-regulation of cell cycle related proteins . analyses of the ic <dig> values and resistance indices indicated knockdown of sall <dig> enhanced the chemo-sensitivity of mcf-7/adr cells to admh. the observed difference in cytotoxicity and intracellular accumulation of admh might be related to the inhibition of sall <dig> affecting the function of bcrp, c-myc and p-gp. the strongest suppression of tumor growth in vivo observed in sall <dig> knockdown combined with admh group suggested knockdown of sall <dig> and admh had synergistic inhibition of tumor growth. in summary, our study provided solid evidence that knockdown of sall <dig> can significantly inhibit the proliferative captivity and reverse the drug resistance of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo; and these results suggest that sall <dig> interference may have a profound effect on the chemotherapy of breast cancer.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study suggests that knockdown of sall <dig> inhibits the proliferation of mcf-7/adr cells through arresting the cell cycle in the g <dig> phase and that down-regulation of sall <dig> reverses the drug resistance of breast cancer by reducing the expression of abcg <dig> and c-myc. however, further mechanisms of sall <dig> affecting tumor growth and drug sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy are required to investigate.
