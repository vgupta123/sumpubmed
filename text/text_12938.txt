BACKGROUND
microbes have been considered as potential control agents for termites, as alternatives and adjuncts to chemical control measures. termite behavior and grooming mechanisms present limitations to the effectiveness of termite microbial control  <cit> , though it is suggested that combining pathogenic strains with other strains and with insecticides may improve efficacy  <cit> . behavior of mound building termites was found to limit spread of an isolate of metarhizium anisopliae throughout the colony, with repellency being the primary inhibitory factor  <cit> . a formulation of another strain with reduced repellency was shown to kill nests of nasutitermes exitiosus termites by baiting in limited field trials. the microbes in this study were chosen because of evidence of their causing mortality to termites or other insects and are here screened for their degree of non-repellency.

m. anisopliae, when tested against the subterranean termite reticulitermes flavipes, was found to cause alarm, aggregation and defensive reactions among termites that were untreated  <cit> . other fungi caused a lesser degree of alarm response which was followed by grooming and isolation of the infected termites. in addition, m. anisopliae was found to repel the formosan subterranean termite , coptotermes formosanus, in tree-based mulches, however some of the repellency may have been attributable to substances from the mulches  <cit> . although, potential for m. anisopliae as a control agent for termites was demonstrated when, in a test of eight entomopathogenic strains against the subterranean termite c. gestroi, m. anisopliae was found to be the most virulent  <cit> . a novel strain of m anisopliae was found to cause significantly greater mortality of fst alates and workers than a previously commercialized strain  <cit> .

isaria fumosorosea is an entomopathogenic fungus that has been previously shown to cause significant mortality to fst  <cit> . i. fumosorosea is formulated in a wettable powder suitable for delivery with keratin foam. the keratin foam was developed as a biologically compatible delivery mechanism for termite microbial control agents  <cit> . species of paecilomyces sect. isarioidea are synonymous with isaria <cit> .

bacillus thuringienis is known to produce compounds toxic to some insects and to be pathogenic to others. because bacillus strains produce spores there is potential that this microbe will tolerate the nest environment of the termite, and produce infectious propagules in the soil and termite nest environment inhabited by termites. b. thuringiensis berliner has caused mortality of the termite nasutitermes ehrhardti <cit> . bacillus isolates have been identified in the gut of c. formosanus, indicating the ability of the genus to survive, and potentially cause mortality of the termite  <cit> .

termite antennae play a significant role in grooming  <cit> . termites without antennae did not remove conidia of i. fumosorosea and m. anisopliae as efficiently as did termites with antennae. also, termites reared individually were more susceptible to microbial infection than were termites reared in groups and subject to grooming by nestmates  <cit> . to effectively control termites using microbes it will be critical to select pathogens that are capable of not only causing mortality but also withstanding detection and removal. microbial strains that are both virulent and non-repellent have a greater likelihood of being spread within a termite nest and controlling termites in the field. results are described here for virulence and non-repellency of potential microbial control strains.

RESULTS
a concern when applying microbial control agents is whether they will repel the target insect rather than infect and kill them. studies with termites in the laboratory show the ability of microbial agents to kill termites, however few of these experiments have been translated to the field  <cit> . fst are known to remove infected nestmates from the nest and to partition infected areas of the nest and this has the potential to limit availability of inoculum  <cit> . by selecting strains of fungi and bacteria that are pathogenic and also not repellent to termites, the probability of applying a microbial agent that functions successfully in the field is increased.

i. fumosorosea is known to cause mortality of insect pests  <cit> . a fermentation method was developed to produce stable spores in an inert powder which can be wetted, thereby inducing germination, prior to application  <cit> . this powder formulation has been combined with a biologically-compatible foam to permit expansion of the pathogen into the carton nest of termites  <cit> . foam expansion increases exposure of termites to the fungal pathogen carried therein. i. fumosorosea was previously shown to kill termites which were exposed directly to the dry formulation powder  <cit> . to more closely approximate field application of a wet microbial agent, termites were exposed to the spores in a liquid solution, as opposed to a dry formulation. the termites were transferred from the liquid to dampened filter paper, which served as a moisture and nutrient source, for incubation and enumeration of mortality. by day  <dig> the  <dig> and  <dig> spores/ml treatments caused  <dig>  ± 0% and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality, respectively . upon calculating the analysis of variance it was determined that the  <dig> treatment was not significantly different from the control which caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality on day  <dig>  on day  <dig>  the control had reached  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality, while the  <dig> and  <dig> concentrations had reached  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively. all three mortality rates were significantly different from each other on day  <dig>  on day  <dig>  the  <dig> and  <dig> concentrations caused mortality rates of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and 100 ± 0%, respectively, which were not significantly different from each other, but they were both significantly different from the control mortality rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %.

m. anisopliae strain nrrl  <dig> was isolated from dead fst alates and was found to be pathogenic to both fst alates and workers  <cit> . spores were previously introduced to termites by individual inoculation  <cit> . using the liquid exposure method it was found that on day  <dig> the  <dig> spores/ml concentration caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality, which was significantly higher than the  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality exhibited by the control and the  <dig> spores/ml concentration, respectively . on day  <dig>  the control and  <dig> spores/ml concentration were again not significantly different at  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively, while the  <dig> spores/ml concentration caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality. by day  <dig> the  <dig> spores/ml concentration had killed 100 ± 0% of the termites and the  <dig> spores/ml treatment, at  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality, was still not significantly higher than the control mortality which was  <dig>  ± 0% .

b. thuringiensis strain  <dig> was selected from a culture collection for evaluation against fst. it was originally isolated from diseased insect larvae. neither of the bacillus treatments caused significantly higher mortality than the control on days  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> . on day  <dig> the mortality rate was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the control,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the <dig> treatment and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the  <dig> treatment. on day  <dig> the control caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality,  <dig> cells/ml caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % mortality, and  <dig> cells/ml caused 10 ±  <dig> % mortality. on day  <dig>  the mortality values for the control, the  <dig> and  <dig> treatments were  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively.

each of the microbial agents was evaluated for the degree of non-repellency toward termites. non-repellent agents are less likely to be detected and avoided by termites, thereby increasing the probability of causing a pathogenic effect  <cit> . termites were tested by exposure to the three microbes in sand, soil and sawdust. the number of fst remaining in tubes containing an entomopathogen was compared to the number of termites remaining in control tubes following 24 hrs in a paired choice test. repellency was evident by termite foraging behavior in treated arenas differing significantly from termite behavior in untreated controls. non-repellency was reported as no statistical difference between the numbers of termites in tubes.

there were no significant differences when termites were exposed to i. fumosorosea at either  <dig> spores/g or  <dig> spores/g in any of the substrates . at a concentration of 108 m. anisopliae spores/g, an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  termites remained in the treated sand tubes while  <dig>  ±  <dig>  remained in the controls, but the difference was not significant. with some treatments, ex. i. fumosorosea and m. anisopliae in soil and sawdust, more termites remained in treated tubes after 24 h exposure than in control tubes, but none of the treatments was significantly different from its respective control. based on these data the fungi i. fumosorosea and m. anisopliae were shown to not be repellent to fst in sand, soil or sawdust.

when termites were exposed to b. thuringiensis strain  <dig> the effect of both cells and spores was determined. all treatments were applied at a concentration of  <dig> propagules/g. with cells in sand or soil, the treated tube values were not significantly different from the controls . with cells in sawdust, the difference was highly significant with only  <dig>  ±  <dig>  termites remaining in the treated tubes compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in the control tubes . these values indicated that the b. thuringiensis cells were strongly repellent to fst in sawdust. fst were also exposed to a b. thuringiensis culture in which the cells had formed spores due to nutrient deprivation. neither the soil nor sawdust treatments were significantly different from the respective controls, indicating that b. thuringiensis in these treatments was not repellent to fst. b. thuringiensis was also tested for its effect on fst as a mixture of cells and spores. the culture was incubated in media with a diluted nutrient source and the formation of spores was observed microscopically over time. the termites were exposed when the culture was as close as possible to 50% vegetative cells and 50% spores. in sand, the cell/spore treatment resulted in significantly more termites remaining in the control tubes compared with the treated tubes. neither the soil or sawdust treatments were significantly different from the controls.

CONCLUSIONS
of the microbes tested, i. fumosorosea demonstrated the highest rate of mortality when termites were exposed to the spores in liquid. this is consistent with previous mortality studies that showed a significant pathogenic effect of this fungus against fst  <cit> . in this study i. fumosorosea was also found to not repel termites in a paired choice test in sand, soil or sawdust. for any microbial agent to be effective as a termite control agent the cells or spores must not be repellent, as repellency will result in detection and avoidance by the members of the colony  <cit> . i. fumosorosea has the added advantage of being produced as a stable powder  <cit> . this fungus has also been formulated in a biologically-compatible foam suitable for application to termite nest environments  <cit> . the foam has the potential to be used with m. anisopliae and other microbial agents.

of the microbes tested, b. thuringiensis cells were found to repel termites only when in sawdust, and in the combination of cells and spores in sand. the remaining treatments, cells in sand and soil; spores in sand, soil and sawdust; and a combination of cells and spores in soil and sawdust, were not repellent to fst. however, when termites were exposed in liquid to the bacterium it was found to not be significantly pathogenic.

based on the data reported here the fungi tested were found to not be repellent to fst. both strains are pathogenic to this species of termite and have potential to control it in the field. the bacillus strain had the lowest rate of mortality and, when exposed as cells in sawdust or as a combination of cells and spores in sand, was repellent to fst. of the three microbes tested it would be the least likely to be selected for further development. the method reported here can be used to screen other bacillus strains, and other potential bacterial entomopathogens, for mortality of fst in liquid. using this method more closely approximates the liquid-based application which will ultimately be used in the field. the fact that the i. fumosorosea and m. anisopliae strains tested were pathogenic to fst and were here found to not repel termites makes them viable candidates for control of fst.
