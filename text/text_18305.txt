BACKGROUND
proteins within a homologous family usually share a 'general' function while functional specificities may vary within a family. proteins belonging to subgroups  may evolve slightly different functions and different substrate specificities while maintaining an overall function of a family. positions that are conserved within subsets of closely related proteins in a given family, but are variable between the subsets, are likely to be involved in functional specificity  <cit> . these sites generally determine the protein specificity either by binding to specific substrate or through interaction with specific protein partner. in many cases, comparative techniques allow one to assign common specificity to groups of proteins, and thus provide data for analysis of specificity determining residues in protein sequences  <cit> .

several computational techniques have been designed to predict specificity determining sites. the evolutionary trace method identified invariant specific residues by partitioning the phylogenetic tree into subgroups of similar sequences  <cit> . various site-specific conservation scores have been offered to distinguish conserved functionally important sites from the background of neutral changes, such as relative entropy, mutual entropy or "sequence harmony"  <cit> . other methods have overcome the limitation of requirement of pre-defined subgrouping by simultaneous identification of optimal groups and specific conserved positions  <cit> . in our previous study  <cit>  we reported a method that encodes the specific conservation pattern within and between subfamilies using amino acids' physico-chemical properties and the evolutionary rates.

despite several recent efforts, successful prediction of specificity determining sites  still remains to be a difficult task. on one hand, the lack of success might be caused by the limited availability of experimentally characterized subsites which, in turn, can make the methods to be biased toward the prediction of certain types of subsites. moreover, the specificity may be affected by subtle changes in residue stereochemistry which can be difficult to detect and in many cases subsites are located on flexible or disordered loops that are difficult to characterize. therefore, a comparative analysis of subsite prediction methods on a larger, comprehensive dataset will provide a reliable evaluation revealing the weak and strong points of each method. additionally, a meta-prediction approach combining the results from best performing methods would be also useful for identification of new potential subsites. it should be mentioned that division of protein families into subfamilies is also a crucial step and requires careful manual intervention. however, reasonable success of several recent methods  <cit>  is encouraging to advocate use of automated subgrouping in specificity site prediction.

in this study, prediction performances of almost all available methods were tested and validated using a comprehensive dataset comprising  <dig> protein families for which experimental data are available for subsites. several additional potential subsites were also predicted by combining the results of methods showing the best performance on the benchmark of  <dig> families , speer  <cit>  groupsim  <cit>  and multirelief  <cit> . potential subsites, commonly predicted either by all three best methods  or by any two  can be excellent targets for mutagenesis studies to reveal specificity determining sites. we also showed that the analysis of structural characteristics of actual and predicted subsites might provide the means to validate the prediction accuracy.

RESULTS
performance evaluation of subsite prediction methods
multiple sequence alignments of  <dig> families  were used to identify actual subsites. experimentally supported subsites  from these families were considered as gold standards for the evaluation of performance of five prediction methods, namely speer  <cit>  groupsim  <cit>  and multirelief  <cit> , sdppred  <cit>  and spel  <cit> . the prediction sensitivities of these five methods are shown  as receiver operating characteristics  curves where sensitivity is plotted against the error rate . rocn statistics for individual methods are also provided in table  <dig>  as can be seen from figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  speer, groupsim and multirelief clearly perform better than the other two methods with their sensitivities at 5% error rate being  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . similar trend is also observed in pr  curves where precision  for each method is plotted on the y-axis, and recall  is plotted on the x-axis . it should be mentioned that the spel method does not take full advantage of the curated subfamily clustering provided in the validation testset since spel performs the clustering automatically along with the subsite identification. if there is no information on subfamilies, the automatic clustering is advantageous, but this is not within the scope of our paper to analyze such cases.

prediction of potential subsites and their structural properties
based on the performance assessment using the validation dataset  three best performing methods, namely speer  <cit>  groupsim  <cit>  and multirelief  <cit>  were further employed to identify new potential subsites. results  from these three methods were compared and sites that were commonly predicted by all three methods  or by any pair of methods  were selected as new potential subsites. additional file  <dig> provides a list of such  <dig> new potential subsites  for all families.

since the sets of c <dig> and c <dig> sites do not include actual subsites and are not assigned any combined rank and score , it is difficult to validate the performance of the ensemble approach. to estimate the performance, we defined subsites predicted by three or two methods . altogether we identified  <dig> such c <dig> and  <dig> c <dig> sites, calculated the pr statistics and compared it with each individual method . expectedly, c3' and c2' sites provide better reliability  than sensitivity  compared to individual prediction methods.

distribution of spatial distances
understandably, experimental validation is the most authentic verification process for the predicted subsites. but, in the absence of such rigorous protocol one alternate way would be to examine structural features which are characteristic for actual subsites  and to compare them with the characteristic structural features of predicted subsites.

structural properties of actual and predicted subsites
important structural characteristics such as solvent accessibility, secondary structural content and hydrogen bonding patterns of actual and predicted subsites were analyzed and compared. figure  <dig> shows the solvent accessibility, secondary structure content and hydrogen bonding patterns of actual subsites , c <dig>  and c <dig>  sites. overall, the distributions of structural properties of potential subsites are not very different from that observed for actual subsites or all sites. as can be seen from this figure, subsite prediction methods tend to over predict sites in beta-strands and under predict sites in solvent accessible areas and coils which are less evolutionary conserved than protein cores.

examples of predicted subsites
actual and potential subsites are shown for four protein families in figure  <dig>  for the idh_imdh family, speer, groupsim and multirelief identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> actual subsites, respectively, at 15% error rate. however, three other sites  were commonly predicted by all three methods . figure 4a maps the actual subsites along with sites that were commonly predicted by all three  or any two methods  onto 3d-structure of a representative protein from idh_imdh family. spatial mapping of the potential subsites shows that two  of the three c <dig> sites, reside within close distance  with respect to the specific cofactor nadp  or specific ligand, isocitrate . in addition, five c <dig> sites  are also found to be less than  <dig> Å apart in space from the nadp or isocitrate molecule.

for nucleotidyl cyclase family both actual subsites were identified by speer, groupsim and multirelief within 15% error rate . eight potential c <dig> sites and three c <dig> sites fall within  <dig> Å distance from the specific activator  or p-site inhibitor molecules .

speer and groupsim successfully predicted both actual subsites  for the serine protease family while multirelief failed to identify one subsite  within 15% error rate. however, there are seven sites besides actual subsites that were commonly predicted by all three methods. figure 4c provides a representative structure of trypsin with the actual subsites and commonly predicted subsites . all c <dig> sites reside less than  <dig> Å apart from the specificity determining serine residue  whereas three c <dig> sites reside within  <dig> Å from the serine residue.

finally, nine c <dig> and seven c <dig> sites were identified for the lactate-malate dehydrogenase  family. figure 4d shows a representative structure of lactate dehydrogenase complexed with cofactor, nad  and ligand, oxamate. predicted c <dig> and c <dig> sites were also projected onto the lactate dehydrogenase structure. 3d structural images were generated using the pymol software  <cit> .

prediction of potential subsites using automatic family clustering
to check whether the use of automatic family clustering and the lack of manual curation would affect the subsite prediction accuracy, we predicted subsites for six protein families obtained from proteinkeys database  that have automatically defined subgroups with at least three protein sequences. three best performing prediction methods  were applied to this testset to identify potential new candidate subsites for specificity determination . since there is no information on the actual subsite locations for the automatically determined alignments from "prediction testset", we applied structural analysis of c <dig> and c <dig> sites which, as was shown in the previous section, may be indirectly used to validate the subsite prediction accuracy. potential subsites for the six families as suggested by common prediction of all three methods or any two methods are listed in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig> c <dig> and  <dig> c <dig> sites were identified for the six families. these identified c <dig> and c <dig> sites could be extremely important in determining the specificity and therefore can be ideal target for mutagenesis experiments. figure  <dig> provides projection of these predicted c <dig> and c <dig> sites onto representative structures from six families. commonly predicted c <dig> and c <dig> sites are shown in space filling model and are colored in green and blue, respectively. 3d structural images were generated using the pymol software  <cit> .

spatial distances among the c <dig> and c <dig> sites were also analyzed. it has been observed that 90% of c <dig> sites are located within  <dig> Å distance with respect to each other  whereas 80% of c <dig> sites reside within  <dig> Å distance. overall, we observed similar distributions of structural properties of potential  subsites from prediction testset and c <dig> and c <dig> sites identified from validation testset . one exception is the solvent accessibility which tends to be larger for potential sites from the prediction testset.

discussion
it is extremely difficult task to detect features that are responsible for protein functional divergence and further differentiate evolutionary changes leading to new specificities. indeed, despite numerous efforts in predicting the specificity determining sites, the accuracy remains limited as most methods are not sensitive enough to detect small variations between subsites. an alternate approach to the underlying problem has been examined here, where several prediction methods were simultaneously employed for detection of subsites within protein families. this ensemble approach combining best performing methods not only validates the performance of the available prediction methods but, also provides reliability of the new prediction. the performance of five methods, namely, speer  <cit>  groupsim  <cit> , multirelief  <cit> , sdppred  <cit> , and spel  <cit>  were evaluated in  <dig> well studied protein families. these families provide accurate alignments, reliable subgroup identifications and the locations of subsites. although all methods identified majority of actual subsites, speer, groupsim and multirelief performed better and reached reasonable sensitivities of 54%, 38% and 40% at 5% error rates. importantly, several other sites  were commonly predicted by three best performing methods  or by any pair of methods . these sites might also be important in determining the specificity and therefore can be ideal targets for mutagenesis experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of structural characteristics first showed that if we use an ensemble of three best methods, the distance distribution of potential subsites has a higher similarity to the distribution of actual subsites for distances less than  <dig> Å. interestingly, we observed a smaller fraction of c <dig> and c <dig> sites at larger distances compared to the actual subsites. we observed a similar distribution pattern while studying the coevolution of subsites in our previous work  <cit>  with 40% of coevolved subsite pairs located at distances more than  <dig> Å. possible explanations for this long-range evolutionary coupling can include the possibility of allosteric regulation, or formation of nonsymmetrical homodimers. as judged from the comparison of distance distributions, the subsites which are closer to each other in space seem to be easier to predict by existing methods. the analysis of hydrogen bonding, solvent accessibility and secondary structure content showed that, overall, distributions of structural properties are quite similar for actual and potential subsites indicating their similar involvement in determining the specificity in protein families.

further, new potential subsites were predicted for six other protein families where subgrouping of the sequences was done by an iterative automated clustering optimization procedure. even though the actual subsites were not available for these families, we were able to observe certain similarities of structural features between predicted and actual subsites which might point to their functional relevance.
