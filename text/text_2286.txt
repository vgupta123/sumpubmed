BACKGROUND
repeated sequences are the most abundant components of many eukaryote genomes. they account for approximately 25 % of the fruit fly  genome  <cit> , 50–69 % of the human genome  <cit>  and nearly 90 % of the maize  genome  <cit> . repeated sequences in eukaryotic genomes vary in their structure, organization and location in chromosomes. the primary criterion is often their distribution profile in chromosomes, that is, their organization in stretches of tandem repeats or as interspersed copies.

the most highly repeated sequences generally lie near or within centromeres and telomeres. tandem repeats within a chromosome segment may contain tens to several thousands of units. these are composed of two main types: 1) stretches of n repeats at telomere ends  <cit> , and 2) satellite dnas composed of tandem repeated units of  <dig> to a few thousand bp. eukaryote genomes may contain one or more families of satellite dna. the sequence of the repeated units and the abundance of each family are generally specific to each species  <cit> .

another type of tandem repeat, found in the inner regions of the chromosome arms, are the simple sequence repeats ; these may be divided into several groups. the first group includes short stretches of tandem repeats with low complexity sequences that are dispersed along chromosomes. this group has further been subdivided into three types depending on the complexity of the repeated unit. the first type are simple repeats, stretches of a and t or c and g nucleotides. the second type gathers micro and minisatellites ) that are  <dig> to 10 bp.  or  <dig> to 60 bp.  long sequence repeats  <cit> . the final type are segmental duplications, these result from the duplication of chromosome segments and are often associated with tandemly repeated genes such as those encoding ribosomal rna  and immunoglobulins. in this last repeat type, when the number of tandem repeats varies between individual alleles within a species they are know as copy number variations   <cit> .

the dispersed nature of a large subsection of repeats is generally the result of their ability to move from one locus to another using a variety of transposition mechanisms including “cut-and-paste”. furthermore, these repeats may also be amplified within chromosomes by transposing using a “copy-and-paste” mechanism. the diversity, origin and classifications of these repeats is the subject of ongoing research . however, the vast majority of dispersed repeated sequences in eukaryotes are likely to be transposable elements . tes so far described in avian genomes can be grouped into four groups based on their sequence organisation . three of these groups include tes that use rnas as a transposition intermediate and have previously been classified as class  <dig> elements. in this case the rna molecule is transcribed from a genomic copy that will later be reverse-transcribed into a dna molecule during, or prior to, insertion at a new chromosomal site. the first of these are the ltr retrotransposons tes and endogenous retroviruses. these contain long terminal repeats  and three open reading frames that encode a group-specific antigen , a reverse transcriptase , and a retroviral envelope protein . the second group of tes that use rnas as a transposition intermediate are the non-ltr retrotransposons, also known as retroposons or long interspersed elements . these tes have no terminal repeats and two open reading frames that encode proteins similar to the gag and rt proteins mentioned above. the third te group that uses an rna intermediate are the short interspersed elements  that are derived from the transcripts of host genes that encode structural rna molecules . sines are not able to move autonomously but rely on the transposition machinery of certain non-ltr retrotransposons. the fourth, and final group of tes do not use an rna intermediate for movement. instead, they use a single or a double-stranded dna molecule as a transposition intermediate  <cit> . this intermediate is either excised or produced by dna replication from a genomic copy and then inserted at a new chromosomal site. these tes, commonly known as dna transposons, were previously gathered in what was called class  <dig> elements. we will refer to them here as "terminal inverted repeats " elements because they display terminal inverted repeats at their ends.

because repeats are often abundant in eukaryotic genomes, annotating them requires considerable effort. tes are a particular challenge because eukaryotic genomes generally contain between tens to hundreds of different te “species” and the abundance of each one may vary considerably. despite this diversity, only a few individual copies within some of these “te species” are actively transposed. the vast majority are inactive remnant copies with sequences that have accumulated a number of nucleotide mutations and rearrangements over time, depending on the age of each “te species” in its host genome. there is currently no reliable and validated strategy for locating and annotating repeats in eukaryotic genomes. this problem has recently been the subject of a call for benchmarking of methods for annotating transposable element in order to optimize reporting of the efficiency of each method and to clarify the nature of the problems encountered  <cit> . the three most commonly used approaches are: library-based methods, signature-based methods, and de novo consensus methods . repeatmasker  is the most widely used library-based method in genome sequencing projects  <cit>  and is typically used in association with repbase, a repeat library that is freely available to academics  <cit> . the tes of numerous genomes have been annotated with rm and a private, inaccessible, library at the institute for system biology   <cit> . the main limitation of such library-based approaches is that the annotations depend very heavily on the quality of the reference database, including completeness and accuracy of the consensus sequences. by contrast, signature based methods focus on traits that are unique to certain tes or repeats. for example, the program ltr finder detects specific dna organization patterns as well as a chain of signatures  specific to retroviruses to detect ltr-retrotransposons  <cit> . tandem repeat finder , another signature method tool, is dedicated to detecting all types of uncomplicated tandem repeats such as simple repeats, microsatellites, minisatellites and satellite dnas  <cit> . finally, dna de novo consensus methods combine a range of detection tools. the repet package is a pipeline that uses both de novo and signature-based methods  and may be used to include a library-based step  <cit> . de novo consensus methods such as repet have been limited until now by their need for powerful resources for calculation and storage which has restricted their application to small eukaryotic genomes . however, advances with computing clusters and a recent repet update have opened the way for the use of this software package with larger genomes such as those of vertebrates.

our work has focused on the analysis of repeats in the smallest vertebrate genome : the red jungle fowl  gallus gallus. avian genomes  are composed of a several macrochromosomes , and many microchromosomes   <cit> . the rjf genome was the third vertebrate genome to be sequenced and is one of the few vertebrate genomes for which a physical map was used to construct the first version of the genome model called galgal <dig>  <cit> . this genome model was then improved in several steps  until the release of galgal <dig> in november  <dig>  <cit> . none of these models may be considered to be definitive, new updates are regularly published, and galgal <dig> must be considered only as an imperfect model of the actual rjf genome. the size of the rjf genome, its c-value which reflects the amount of nuclear dna in the haploid genome, has been estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg by reassociation kinetics  <cit>  and flow cytometry . comparison of the rjf genome size to galgal <dig> can be accomplished by converting the c-value to an absolute number of bp  <cit> . this yields a size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  gbp for the rjf genome while that of the galgal <dig> model is only  <dig>  gbp , a size difference of  <dig> mbp . the origins of this size difference may come from various sources. first, there are likely to be missing sequences in the galgal <dig> model because nearly all the regions overlapping the megacentromeres  <cit>  and megatelomeres , and their neighbouring satellite dnas  <cit>  are absent from the model. this has been estimated to account for approximately 8 % of the rjf genome . furthermore, galgal <dig> does not appear to contain tandem repeats encoding the 18s- <dig> s-28s  and 5s  rrnas  <cit> . this represents approximately 1 % of the rjf genome. a third possible source of the size difference is that features that are located in at-rich, gc-rich, or regions containing short motifs are not always properly represented in libraries based on illumina technology . such sequences are likely responsible in part for the  <dig> unassembled chromosomes in galgal <dig>   <cit> . they could also be the source of chromosome  <dig>  and explain the small size of chromosome  <dig>  because of its high repeat content. this may also be responsible for the fact that most of the other chromosomes in galgal <dig>  are smaller than those of the rjf genome  <cit> , and probably for the fact that avian genomes lack at least some of the ~ <dig> protein-coding genes that are present in all mammals .fig.  <dig> sizes of chromosomes in galgal <dig>  backgound areas in pink indicate macrochromosomes and those in green indicate microchromosomes. note, the chromosome numbering set up in caryology does not form a decreasing series in size with galgal <dig> for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  lge <dig>  and lge <dig> are two linkage groups whose scaffolds are assembled in two chromosomes but currently have no assigned microchromosomes. the  <dig> assembled chromosomes plus the two sex chromosomes w and z and the two lge contain a total of  <dig> , <dig>  mbp. there is also a u chromosome not shown in the graph which contains all the unplaced scaffolds 



a clear understanding of the reasons behind the size differences between the galgal <dig> model and the rjf genome is important in order to understand where the model has failed and how it might be improved. reassociation kinetics indicate that the rjf genome contains approximately 32 % repeats  <cit> . as the galgal <dig> model lacks centromere sequences, telomere, the clusters encoding the rrna and a part of the satellite dna, the total rate of repeats in the genome model is estimated to be between 22–24 %. successive investigations, mainly using the rm library based method, have reported repeat percentages that have gradually increased over time:  <dig>  % in  <dig>  <cit> , 8 % in  <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig>  % in  <dig>  <cit>  , but are still significantly lower than those calculated from dna reassociation kinetics. this suggests that the analysis of repeats in the galgal <dig> assembly needs further investigation.table  <dig> proportion of repeated sequences reported in the chicken

we have re-investigated the status of repeats in the galgal <dig> assembly using mainly a de novo annotation strategy that involves several complementary methods of detection and annotation. we detected repeats in the galgal <dig> model in numbers that are closer to those predicted by physicochemical data. analysis of these new annotations sheds new light on the genome in terms of how its components are organised, including te diversity, distribution, and dynamics. finally, we discuss the benchmarking of various methods used in our investigations in the hope of stimulating debate that may lead to the definition of a gold standard for annotating repeats in assembled genome models.

RESULTS
evaluating the proportion of repeats in the galgal <dig> model in silico
it is important to be able to accurately assess the amount of repetitions in order to properly annotate a genome. dna reassociation kinetics can be used to estimate a conservative proportion of repeats. indeed, the 22–24 % repeat proportion estimated for the rjf is only a minimal value because its calculation is limited by two parameters in the experimental procedure  <cit> . first, the ability of this technique to detect repeats in a genome depends on the length of the fragments used . second many of the repeated sequences in a genome such as that of the rjf are old  <cit> . because these old repeats are likely to have drifted significantly over time it may be assumed that a certain proportion of them will be recovered in the unique component of the dna reassociation kinetics results. in some cases, studies that used more stringent reassociation conditions found an average repeat rate of 13 % in the rjf genome  <cit> . an advantage of some in silico approaches is that they can detect very short sequences. indeed, these methods can be calibrated to be insensitive to the minimum size of repeated sequences as well to their sequence divergence. we selected two such methods, p-clouds  <cit>  and red  <cit>  .

the overall proportion of repeats in the galgal <dig> model detected with p-clouds  and red  were similar, but were also approximately 50 % higher than the values obtained with dna reassociation kinetics. as positive controls we tested the reliability of both methods using two published genomes with well-established repeat content: anopheles gambiae  and drosophila melanogaster . analysis of these genomes was facilitated by the fact that their “te species” sequences are well-conserved. we found that in these control genomes red was the most appropriate program for calculating a reliable rate of repeats because it recovered a substantially larger proportion of previously annotated repeats  than p-clouds  .

strategy for detecting and annotating repeats in galgal4
our approach for accurately estimating the repeat content of the galgal <dig> model was based on published data and analysis of individual repeat types . the resulting strategy  was organized into five steps. first used the program red to estimate the total number of repeats  <cit> . second, trf was used to analyse ssrs  <cit> . third was the te annotation, which demanded the most investment of resources. we used the software package repet  because it has been extensively tested and had been shown to be more efficient than the repeatscout  <cit>  and repeatmodeler  <cit>  packages. we were aware that repet annotations do not always recover 100 % of annotations calculated by the other two packages  <cit> , but decided that these were ultimately only small differences. furthermore, we found that even these small differences were minimized by our use of trf prior to repet, which we found to be more efficient at locating ssrs than either the repet. we performed the repet analysis in three successive detection steps  in order to dig deeper for fragmented repeats than rm. our fourth step in the annotation strategy was to annotate the dark matter  as proposed by maumus et al   <cit> , using a library containing all repeated copies longer than 500 bp detected in step  <dig> and the teannot program  <cit>  rather than repeatmasker   <cit> . for our final step we used the available annotation of cnvs in galgal <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> strategy for detecting and annotating repeats in galgal <dig>  our strategy comprised five successive steps:  <dig>  definition of the number of repeats;  <dig>  number of ssrs;  <dig>  number of tes;  <dig>  definition of dark matter;  <dig>  definition of cnvs. the final products of each of these  <dig> steps were stored in the bed or gff annotation files . arrows show the chronology of events in the processes in each step. black ellipses show the various states of the genome analysed; blue boxes indicate the programs used; green boxes indicate the intermediate library produced by a given process; red boxes indicate the end of a process before editing the bed or gff annotation files. the purple box in step  <dig> indicates the source of the annotation file used for cnvs



profiles of ssrs in galgal <dig> 
the proportion of ssrs in the galgal <dig> model has been estimated, using rm, to be  <dig>  %  <cit> . we reinvestigated this number by examining the diversity and number of microsatellites using the fasta program of the gcg computer package  <cit>  and sputnik  <cit>  while those of satellite dnas were investigated using a variety of molecular approaches . using trf, which can detect ssrs with repeated units from 1 bp to  <dig> kbp, we found that the assembled genome contained  <dig>  % ssrs and the unassembled genome contained  <dig>  % ssrs, for a total coverage of  <dig>  % in the galgal <dig> model. these proportions are at least twice as large as those found with rm . we then went on to look at the features of each type of ssrs. we identified  <dig> ssr types based on the complexity of their repeated unit sequence: simple repeats, microsatellites, minisatellites, and tandem arrays with repeated units of 60 bp. to  <dig> kbp. long that were selected when they were composed of at least  <dig> repeats. we divided these large tandem arrays into two categories: large tandem repeats  and satellite dnas . the coverage of the various types of ssrs in chromosomes indicated that the overall densities of simple repeats and microsatellites were similar. in contrast, minisatellites and tandem arrays were more abundant in some of the galgal <dig> chromosomes  and more similar in others . the proportions of the various categories of ssrs are summarized in table  <dig> and their features are shown in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> percentages of ssrs found using isb annotation or trf in the galgal <dig> model

de novo detection and annotation of dispersed repeats 
the repet pipeline was used to detect repeats and produce annotations. it is composed of two sub-pipelines, tedenovo that detects repeats using a de novo method based on the repetition of sequences, and teannot that produces annotations using a combination of programs and post-processes . we used an iterative strategy involving three runs of the repet pipeline to completely annotate galgal <dig>  and a version of the galgal <dig> model from which the ssrs in chromosomes and a  <dig> mbp satellite dna composed of ~ <dig> kbp repeated units in the z chromosome had been removed  <cit> . the first run  reported  <dig> consensuses  corresponding to repeated sequences. these were filtered with teannot to eliminate residual redundancy between consensuses  and those which had no full-length copy in galgal <dig>  the resulting  <dig> consensuses  were then used to annotate galgal <dig> to extract the annotated repeats and calculate a reduced version of the galgal <dig> model. the second repet run  was run using the reduced galgal <dig> model and produced  <dig> consensuses . these were filtered and  <dig> new consensuses were selected . libraries 1f and 2f were merged in step  <dig> of repet , and filtered manually to remove redundant sequences as well as sequences corresponding to tandem repeats and segmental duplications . finally, these libraries were filtered using teannot and resulted in  <dig> consensuses that were reduced to  <dig>  by manual curation to eliminate consensuses corresponding to pseudogenes. the final annotation of galgal <dig> was calculated with library 3f using teannot and revealed a te coverage of  <dig>  % .fig.  <dig> coverage of tes and dm annotations in galgal <dig> chromosomes. a percentage coverage of each chromosome by repeats resulting from the repet annotation . b percentage coverage of each chromosome by te segments resulting from the dm annotation . in a and b

detection and annotation of highly divergent repeats, mining the dark matter 
genomic dark matter may be defined as “all intergenic sequences, irrespective of functionality or expression” . scientific interest in dark matter was triggered by the discovery of non-coding rnas  that could regulate gene expression. several reports have shown that dark matter is a source of ncrna and that it can cause disease when it malfunctions . today’s studies on dark matter are designed to annotate non-coding rnas using rna-seq, cdna sequencing, tilling arrays or to annotate cis-regulatory dna elements using dnase-seq  <cit> . because genomes have undergone bursts of te production during their evolution and because these tes are actively repressed  <cit> , dark matter could also be considered as a graveyard containing very different, recombined te copies. repeats with sequences that are well conserved can be annotated using default values in the repet pipeline. we used a library containing all repeated copies of the repet annotation and the teannot program to access the dm, the older and/or fragmented te segments . our aim was to use a population of genomic copies as a probe to detect more divergent repeats . computational constraints obliged us to select only te copies >500 bp . the  <dig>  copies used at this step each originated from one of  <dig> consensuses calculated by repet. annotation of the dm increased the te coverage in the galgal <dig> model to  <dig>  % .

finishing the repeat annotation
a characteristic of teannot output files is that each te copy  can be split into several annotations linked to different consensuses belonging to a single te model. we prepared an inventory of te copies in galgal <dig> by processing the final annotation with gfftools to resolve and merge stacked  and juxtaposed annotations. the minimal te copy size was set at 20 bp, 4-bp larger than that of the oligo used as a motif to study repeats in red and p-clouds and 10-bp larger than that used in the isb annotation.

post processing the dm increased te coverage by ~45 %, with the  annotation covering  <dig>  % of galgal <dig> . this proportion of te coverage may be compared to the  <dig>  % coverage in the isb te annotation  <cit> . almost all  dm annotations  were new and only  <dig>  % of them extended existing repet annotation . the sum of ssr and  coverages suggests that there are at least  <dig>  % repeats in galgal <dig>  but this estimate was corrected by intersecting ssrs and  annotations using bedtools software . because  includes 1 % coverage by ssrs, the amount of annotated repeats was  <dig>  %, which was  <dig>  times more dense than the isb annotation  <cit> . intersections were also calculated with the cnv annotation  <cit> , as were those obtained with red and p-clouds. these revealed that ~ <dig>  % of low-repeat sequences , corresponding to cnvs, could be added to the  <dig>  % of repeats, for a total of  <dig>  % repeated sequences in galgal <dig>  looking for the intersection between the red or p-clouds annotations with other annotations  led to embarrassing results regarding the ability of these two methods to reliably calculate the total amount of repeats in a eukaryotic genome. we found that 30 % of the  annotations  were not identified by red and 53 % of the red annotations  had no counterparts among the , ssrs and cnv annotations . these results are even more damning for p-clouds since 72 % of the annotations had no counterparts among the , ssrs and cnv annotations .fig.  <dig> features of annotations calculated by red, repet, and rm. a venn diagram showing the overlaps between the annotation files calculated with red , trf , and repet , and cnvs  <cit> . values correspond to coverage percentages in galgal <dig>  b distributions of annotations sizes calculated with red, trf  and repet , and those of the cnvs  <cit> . dm annotations were split into two batches corresponding to dm annotations that extend pre-existing annotations produced with the same te model  and those that are new . c size distributions of line, ltr, tir and ssr annotations calculated with rm together with those obtained with repet or trf for the same categories. vertical axes in a and b indicate log <dig> in bp. the red lines in the box plot indicate the median value, the ends of grey boxes the quartile  <dig> and  <dig> values, the ends of whisker the 10th and 91st percentiles of the size distribution, and the black stars the highest and the values above or below the  <dig>  interquartile range respectively within  <dig>  interquartile range of the highest or the lowest quartile



as the fragmentation of annotated copies could lead to artefacts during the teannot step we investigated the quality of the de novo  annotations. first, we examined the size distribution of annotations resulting from red for the overall amount of repeated sequences, trf for the ssrs, repet for the tes, teannot for the dm and  and the cnv . this revealed that the range of annotation sizes calculated by red covered the sum of those of the other  <dig> categories and that 90 % of the te copies were 20 bp. to ~1100 bp. the size distributions of annotated copies for each kind of repeat were then compared to those of the isb annotations . the size distributions of line annotations were similar to those of the isb, while those of the ltr, tir and ssr repeats were smaller. this was expected since dm annotations were derived from more fragmented te copies. next, we analysed the diversity of repeats described in the  annotations, their commonalities the isb annotations and the quality of the annotation. this revealed that the coverage patterns by each te type of  <dig> chromosomes  were very different from those of other chromosomes . these different profiles are perhaps due to the small size of the galgal <dig> model chromosome  <dig> , to the greater amount of ltr-retrotransposons in chromosomes  <dig> and w, or perhaps to the non-random distribution profile of some tes. these and similar issues are discussed below.

diversity and features of te models in the  annotation
ranking dispersed repeats within a te “species” or repeat
each te or repeat “species” in libraries such as repbase or that of the isb is defined by a consensus sequence. this consensus sequence may be thought of as the sequence closest to an averaged sequence from a population of copies originating from a single genome. potential protein coding capacity may also play a role in defining these consensus sequences. the methods used to calculate these nucleic acid and protein consensus sequences have not been published by the isb. because these consensus sequences cannot represent all sequence variation they are of limited value for detecting tes. platforms such as dfam  <cit>  were developed to circumvent this issue by using a library of hidden markov models that is set up from existing populations of sequenced elements to annotate genomes. although dfam improves significantly the sensitivity and takes better account of te sequence variations, it is still of limited use for detecting the diversity of rearrangements of tes such as the non-ltr retrotransposons and, to a lesser extent, some ltr-retrotransposons and dna transposons.

we have borrowed the concept of the te model developed by the creators of the program repeatexplorer  <cit>  to describe a “te species”. this concept is also included in the philosophy of repet  <cit> . it assumes that a te model is composed of a main consensus sequence  plus all the consensuses detected as variants. using this concept, our final 3f library contains  <dig> consensuses distributed among  <dig> te models . the final clustering steps were performed manually using information from sequence databases because blastclust in tedenovo does not calculate models that are consistent with the galgal <dig> sequences. our  <dig> te models were in striking contrast to the isb annotation  <cit>  that describe  <dig> different te consensuses . the many repbase and isb consensuses corresponding to non-gene repeats  was partly due to fragmentation of a significant number of repeats intp several consensus sequences associated with a single te species. thus,  <dig> of our te models were split into  <dig> different repbase and isb consensuses . furthermore, there were  <dig> repbase and isb te consensuses involved in the isb annotation  <cit>  that were found in  <dig>  annotations covering 2 % of the genome without any equivalent among our  <dig> te models. conversely,  <dig> of our models had no corresponding sequence in repbase/isb tes.table  <dig> features and diversity of te models found in the galgal <dig> model based on the repet and dm annotations  after stack resolving and merging stacked and juxtaposed annotations

te models in the  annotation
our results confirmed those of previous studies  <cit>  that showed that there were three main types of tes in the galgal <dig> model genome with very different coverage values : non-ltr retrotransposons , ltr retrotransposons , and dna transposons .

the galgal <dig> model contained a single "species" of non-ltr retrotransposon, cr <dig>  these were the most abundant tes with  <dig>  copies representing  <dig>  % of the  annotation . in the light of the above analysis, we re-investigated their diversity and found  <dig> sub-families .

copy numbers of the  <dig> other models of tes and repeats varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  and together represented  <dig>  % of the repet annotation. twenty one “species” of ltr-retrotransposons were found in the repet annotation of galgal <dig> . these were present as copies with two ltrs or solo ltrs resulting from the loss of the inner part of the ltr retrotransposon by recombination between the ltrs of each inserted element   <cit> , or both forms. we found no copies corresponding to complete, internally deleted, or partly truncated element of six models of solo ltrs . but the repet annotation identified new ltr-retrotransposon “species”. this included the retrocalimero, retrosaturnin and retrotux , and  <dig> species of old ltr-retrotransposons  of which only large internal fragments with damaged frames coding for the gag, rt and/or env proteins remain in the galgal <dig> chromosomes. we retained the division into four te models as previously proposed for dna transposons  <cit>  , keeping in mind that they originated from only two species of dna transposons. galluhop was an internally deleted form of mariner1_gg, and charlie-galluhop resulted from the insertion of one galluhop element into a charlie element before amplification of this chimeric element by a charlie-mediated transposition within chromosomes. we also found  <dig> consensuses within  <dig> te models  whose sequence features did not match those of one of the three types described above or with any other known eukaryotic te  <cit> .fig.  <dig> sequence organization of retrocalimero , retrosaturnin  and retrotux . red boxes indicate 361-bp ltrs in retrocalimero , 334-bp ltrs in retrosaturnin  and 498-bp ltrs in retrotux . cyan boxes indicated polypurine tracts just upstream of the 3' ltr. yellow boxes indicate regions of interrupted coding frames for gag or rt detected on the sense strand. the green boxe in c locates a coding frame for gag on the anti-sense strand. we found interrupted frames encoding an rt on the sense strand and a gag-like protein  on the anti-sense strand in the inner regions of retrotux. nucleic acid sequences are shown in additional file 9




these  <dig> te models were completed manually using published data  <cit> . this identified four more te “species” whose low copy number in galgal <dig> made them undetectable using other annotation strategies . two ltr elements, the rous sarcoma virus and the avian myelocytomatosis virus, were integrated as single complete copies into chromosome  <dig>  we also found several repeated segments corresponding to an inner region of the rous sarcoma virus genome in chromosome  <dig>  three ancient ltr-retrotransposons appear to have become domesticated in neogenes; these were found near the origin of the ens <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes  <cit> , the ovex <dig> gene  <cit>  and the map1-like gene  on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. we also found remnant copies of dna transposons, such as a polinton te  <cit>  on chromosomes  <dig> and z. these remnant sequences still contained interrupted frames coding for an rve integrase and a megaviridae-like major capsid protein on chromosome  <dig>  and dna polymerases b on chromosome  <dig> and z . these regions are conserved in chromosomes  <dig> and z of the meleagris gallopavo  genome; the coding frames for the dna polymerase b on the z chromosome are the easiest to elucidate . there were also traces of a wide variety dna transposons within  <dig> neogenes coding for transposase derived proteins, all of which must have emerged before the evolutionary separation of the mammalia and sauropsida lineages .

differences between isb and  annotations
as indicated above, the results of our  and isb annotations were not in complete agreement .  <dig> repbase and isb te consensuses involved in the isb annotation had no equivalent in our te models. we investigated these differences to compare how the two methods annotated loci, followed by determining the quality of the isb annotations that had no annotation by our procedure . the main conclusion was that the annotations calculated with library-based methods depend heavily on the quality of the library used. a library that is not composed of well-curated consensuses tends to force and fragment annotations.

the current view of the chromosome organization with respect to tes  <cit>  is that macrochromosomes display protein-coding genes and te densities that are respectively lower and higher than those of the microchromosomes. in an attempt to verify these features we investigate the depletions or the over-representations of tes, genes, scaffold/matrix attachment region  elements and cpg islands in macrochromosomes and microchromosomes using permutation tests . the analyses were conducted in terms of numbers of copies  or coverage , both of which produced similar results. we then used these  <dig> dna elements together with chromosome size to show that there were not two, but at least three types of chromosomes that had at least four features. the first group was composed of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and z, the largest chromosomes, with more tes and s/mars  and fewer protein-coding genes and cpg islands than expected by chance . the second group included chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with fewer tes and cpg islands and more protein-coding genes than expected , but with a number of s/mar elements that varied significantly from one chromosomes to another . the third group contained all the smallest chromosomes, these were poorer in tes and s/mars , but richer in protein-coding genes and cpg islands than expected . chromosomes w and lge <dig> were two notable exceptions that did not fit into these  <dig> chromosome types. they had features of both macrochromosomes, rich in tes and cpg islands, and microchromosomes, chromosome size, number of protein-coding genes, and smars .fig.  <dig> graph showing the expected and observed numbers of copies of tes , genes , s/mar  and cpg islands  in galgal  <dig> chromosomes. each box was calculated from  <dig> permutations and represents the 98 % distributions obtained per chance. red crosses above the boxes indicate over-representation of the element in the chromosome and blue crosses under-representation . pink backgound areas indicate macrochromosomes and green areas indicate microchromosomes. all galgal <dig> chromosomes were analysed except chromosome  <dig>  which was too small 



these features of the rjf chromosome organization were then used to investigate the distribution of tes with reference to protein-coding genes , cpg islands and s/mars . we checked the te distribution between exons, other protein-coding genes and intergenic regions in the galgal <dig> chromosomes using te annotations resulting from step <dig>  and the final  annotations . whichever way it was examined ), the general trend was that tes were more abundant in intergenic regions, the exception were the repeats of the undetermined_group_ <dig>  which were abundant in exonic regions once the most divergent copies  were included in the calculation. both our annotations and those of the isb found that the abundance of te copies in exons were similar. the  annotations  showed that there were more te copies  in exons than in the isb annotation  or the te annotation alone  and  <dig>  % for coverage in both. this suggested that the rate at which ancient and more recent te copies became recently exonized is similar to those reported for mammalian genomes .fig.  <dig> coverages of tes in galgal <dig> chromosomes with respect to the numbers of genes , cpg islands and s/mar . histograms in a and b show the coverages of te copies annotated by repet and those of the  annotation in each chromosome. the names of each of the  <dig> models are indicated in the left margin. the  <dig> bars near the abscissa describe data for the  <dig> te models , those of the isb annotations , and the proportions of the exonic, genic and intergenic regions in galgal <dig> . a grey background indicates one of the four te types in galgal4: line, ltr, tir and u . the name is shown in the right margin. histogram in b shows the proportions of tes . background areas in green indicate te data from the isb annotation, light purple indicates the repet  annotations, and blue indicates the  annotations. the bar  near the abscissa shows the proportions of exons, introns and intergenes in galgal <dig>  in a, b and c, the exons  are shown in red, genes are in yellow and the intergene regions are in green. a purple vertical bar indicates the size of the intergene regions in galgal <dig>  the histogram in d represents the coverage/percentages of cpg islands, s/mar elements and tes inserted in cpg islands and s/mar elements , the 3-kbp distal and 3-kbp proximal ends of cpg islands and s/mar elements  and in the rest of the chromosomes 



there were  <dig>  cpg islands  and  <dig>  s/mar  in galgal <dig>  the abundance of tes in two kinds of elements and their  <dig> kbp proximal and distal regions  were similar to those in the rest of the genome. this is very different from the human and mouse genomes, where regions containing s/mar are enriched in tes  <cit>  and cpg islands are enriched in sines  <cit> .

we concluded that tes are more abundant in the intergenic regions of the rjf genome and are no more concentrated in cpg islands and s/mar than in the rest of the genome. we determined the densities of all tes. every te species chromosomal distributionwas investigated because the data in fig.  <dig> indicated that the distribution patterns of some te species in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and w were quite specific.

te distributions between and within galgal <dig> chromosomes
a survey of global te density  indicated that chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  lge <dig>  z and w contained more te copies than the other chromosomes. the profiles of te species seem to be strikingly different from one species to another. we first found that the global density in cr <dig>  was similar to the global te density, except in chromosome w. the picture was very similar for each of the  <dig> cr <dig> sub-families . the densities of cr1-c, cr1_f, cr1-g were greater in chromosomes  <dig> and w than were those of cr1-d, cr1_gg, cr1-y and cr1_like, which were close to those of chromosomes  <dig> to  <dig>  the density of cr1-h was elevated only in chromosome w.fig.  <dig> te density in galgal <dig> chromosomes. histograms of te model densities calculated for all galgal <dig> chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig> . a, all te models, b, cr <dig>  c kronos, d retrocalimero, e, putative_ltr_group  <dig> and f, charlie. the number of copies for each dataset are indicated in parentheses. results for all other te models are shown in additional files  <dig> and 15




we identified six other te density profiles . the first profile contains cr1s and one other element, hitchcock . the te species in the second and third profiles are found in most chromosomes; they may be super-abundant , or less abundant  relative to chromosome size. the fourth density profile included twenty ltrs and five undetermined_group_ <dig> to  <dig> species; the putative_ltr_group <dig> is the exception. these were present in many chromosomes at low density, but were abundant in chromosome w and one or more other chromosomes  <dig>  lge <dig> and lge <dig> . the fifth and sixth density profiles each contained just one element, the putative_ltr_g <dig>  is only present in half the chromosomes and z rep elements are mostly concentrated on the z and w chromosomes .

we looked for te hot spots using permutations tests . global analysis of all te models showed that the chromosomes richest in tes  are those that also contain many te hot spots. the global profile of hot spots for cr <dig> elements, like the density profiles, is very similar to that of all models , except for chromosome w. however, the hot spot profiles for the eight cr <dig> sub-families were different . we found that five ltr species had no hot spots in galgal <dig> . this suggests that their distribution is driven only by certain chromosomal features, not by specific regions. the hot spots of other ltr species are generally on chromosome w , except for the putative_ltr_group <dig> , whose hot spots were only on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the hot spot profiles of the remaining te species  were all concentrated on the largest chromosomes , but could be very different from one to another .fig.  <dig> density of te hot spots in galgal <dig> chromosomes. histograms of te hot spot density calculated for all galgal <dig> chromosomes, except chromosome  <dig> . hot spot are defined  using permutation assays with a all te models, b kronos, c putative_ltr_group <dig>  d retrocalimero, e charli and f mariner1_gg. the number of copies for each dataset are indicated in parenthesis. results for all other te models are shown in additional files  <dig> and 17




we found that distribution of our  <dig> te species along the chromosomes varied between species. most ltr elements were found on chromosome w, but other than that the distributions of the remaining te species did not seem to reflect any preferences for insertion in the galgal <dig> model. our analysis suggests that most rjf tes are likely ancient elements that contain significant numbers of point mutations and are thus probably inactive. this in turn suggests that the te species distributions result both of the insertion preference of each te species and the ability of the rjf genome to eliminate or conserve them during evolution, depending on the region where each te is inserted. we cannot examine this topic any further using the chicken recombination maps because these data are not available for the rjf. calculations from domestic breeds cannot be directly used for the rjf genome since they differ from one breed to another  <cit> , and the extent to which the sizes of the genomes and non-gene regions in between rjf and domesticated lines differ has not yet been evaluated. there is a strong correlation between gc richness and chromosome recombination rates  <cit> , but we find no such correlation between the gc content and local te densities in chromosomes. the forces driving the density and hot spot profiles of each of the  <dig> te models in galgal <dig> are therefore due to something other than ectopic recombination.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has succeeded in its two main objectives. first, we have developed a general strategy for annotating  repeated sequences in a model of an avian genome. second, we have used this strategy to annotate the repeated sequences in galgal <dig> using repeat models that can directly be used to annotate the rjf genome.

ins and outs of our approach to annotate repeats in eukaryotic genomes
our study suggests that before investing manpower and resources into genome annotation, researchers would to well to calibrate their annotation strategy using existing information on the size of the real and model genomes, as well as on estimates of repeat amounts. here, the size of the real genome was estimated from data on several species in various databases  <cit> . we used a k-mer method to calculate the genome size where data were not available, as was done recently with cephalopoda species  <cit> . the reliability of this new approach needs to be tested on both avian and mammal models once the program is available. reassociation kinetics data are particularly valuable because tools such a p-clouds and red are unreliable for estimating the total proportion of repeats in galgal <dig>  while implementation of our annotation strategy required a significant investment in time and computer resources, it enabled us to annotate the repeats in galgal <dig> more reliably than using rm. our annotation strategy has shown that there are more repeats  and less te diversity  in galgal <dig> than previously reported  <cit> .

our results confirm that de novo approaches for annotating repeats are more efficient than library-based method and are less likely to produce artefactual annotations. we found that at least some of the isb annotations  are probably artefacts. this is a fault shared by all library-based methods, which tends to force the search for sequence matches that vary greatly in size to consensuses present in the reference sequence library. this fault can be amplified when many heterospecific te sequences are available and the reference library contains no specific repeated sequences. nevertheless, previously published data and repbase were useful. indeed, in our hands repet was able to produce many consensuses  that would have been difficult to manage without any idea of their putative organisation in sub-families, thanks to the many described cr <dig> non-ltr retrotransposons in galgal <dig>  their 5' truncation profiles, and ages. therefore we suggest that anyone wanting to use a similar annotation strategy on other models shoulf perform preliminary analyses of non-ltr retrotransposons  before implementing the current version of the repet pipeline.

the galgal <dig> genome model was released in january  <dig>  <cit> , just as we were preparing the final version of our manuscript. this new version contains  <dig>  gbp, close to the c-value  and has fewer ambiguities . its greater size is due to the discovery of about  <dig> new genes . repeat annotation with rm revealed that galgal <dig> has  <dig>  % satellite ssrs and  <dig>  % tes, for a total of  <dig>  % repeated sequences. these repeated sequences were annotated using the approach and models described above. results and gff files are available at http://chicken-repeats.inra.fr/. they indicate that are  <dig>  % ssrs and  <dig>  % tes; our annotation gives the total amount of these repeated sequences as  <dig>  %. we verified the distributions of tes in the inter-gene and intra-gene regions and found results similar to those presented here in fig. 8a and c .

new insights provided by a deeper repeat annotation
in addition to the number of repeats and te diversity, our annotation update modifies the landscape of repeats in the rjf genome. first, even though further investigations will be required to evaluate their exact sizes  <cit> , the sum of the 4–8 % of centromere and telomere sequences to the  <dig>  % of repeats found in galgal <dig>  is not far off from the real rjf genome . although the rjf genome contains fewer repeats than most mammal genomes, this repeat content is nearly a 3-times greater than previous estimates, similar to the repeats in chiroptera  genomes  <cit> . the distributions of repeats in avian chromosomes differ from those in other vertebrate genomes in at least two ways. first, there are many different, small families of satellite dnas interspersed along chromosome arms in addition to repeats in megacentromeres and megatelomeres, and these satellite dnas are more abundant in small chromosomes. this distribution of satellite dnas might in fact label each small chromosome with something like a satellite dna code. these labels might even be involved in chromosome recognition and influence the physical separation of small and large chromosomes that occurs during cell division in birds  <cit> . second, none of the  <dig> te species found in galgal <dig> are randomly distributed along chromosomes. most of them are arranged in specific patterns that suggest that they were not randomly inserted into chromosomes during evolution, and conversely were not randomly eliminated from chromosomes.

this brings us to the idea that tes are inactive in present-day chicken. recent data indicate that few te species are active in mammals and insects and that some are involved in development and differentiation pathways . it would therefore appear that inactive tes are an avian characteristic, as these pathways are also present in sauropsida species. our annotation indicates that there are at least three active tes in the chicken genome. the first is eav-hp, an ltr element that was shown recently to have been active in the chicken  <cit> . the other two are in elements that were until recently considered to be neogenes coding for transposases, thap <dig> and pgbd <dig> . these two genes are present and active in every vertebrate species and were recently shown to transpose, in trans, non-autonomous related tirs in the human genome  <cit> .

thus the importance of tes in avian genomes is far from completely elucidated; the most abundant te species may well not be the most interesting candidates for studying genome rearrangements during development.
