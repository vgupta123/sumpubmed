BACKGROUND
humans infected by enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  suffer from gastroenteritis. sometimes they develop hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic uremic syndrome which can cause kidney failure  <cit> . treatment of an ehec infection with antibiotics is under debate since this can increase the risk for the hemolytic uremic syndrome  <cit> . therefore, much effort should be put into prevention of transmission. however, this is complicated due to the low infectious dose of less than  <dig> bacterial cells  <cit> . infection sources are multiple  <cit> : bacteria can persist and reproduce in soil, dung, water or other environmental niches, eventually causing fresh produce to be contaminated  <cit> . typical vectors for ehec outbreaks include spinach, apple juice, unpasteurized milk, lettuce, but also meat products such as sausage  <cit> . a large outbreak in japan  <dig> caused more than  <dig> infections and was due to contaminated radish sprouts  <cit> . fenugreek sprouts  caused a severe outbreak with more than  <dig> infected and  <dig> dead in germany in  <dig>  the sprouts were contaminated with a related bacterium, escherichia coli o104:h <dig>  <cit> . thus, the spectrum of environmental niches of pathogenic e. coli is quite large, ranging from water, single cell organisms to plant and lower animals and vertebrates  <cit> .

gene regulation of ehec has been studied under individual conditions using microarrays or related techniques . however, microarrays are limited, especially when examining rare or highly abundant transcripts or unknown genes. new methods in transcriptome analysis such as strand-specific rna-seq using next generation sequencing  technologies have a much higher resolution  <cit> . to date, only a few studies examined bacterial pathogens . in this work, we applied strand-specific rna-seq to ehec to identify genes involved in environmental and plant persistence with a special focus on hypothetical genes.

about one third of the genes of ehec are still annotated as hypothetical. hypothetical proteins are defined as genes that have no homology to any other predicted protein in any species  <cit>  and the function of these genes is largely unknown. after sequencing a new genome their existence is predicted by annotation tools, e.g., glimmer  <cit>  or genemarks  <cit> . at this stage, there is no experimental evidence for the expression of these genes. a characterization of all hypothetical genes at the current rate would take decades  <cit> . however, transcription studies allow confirmation of the activity of hypothetical genes, pre-characterize and remove them from the hypothetical category  <cit> . the expression of some hypothetical proteins of ehec has already been reported in single environmental studies, e. g., during heat shock  <cit>  or in adhesion to bovine epithelial cells  <cit> . however, global approaches, which cover a large environmental spectrum to identify functional hypothetical genes, are still missing. we therefore sequenced the transcriptomes of several ehec-cultures from a high diversity of conditions strand-specifically to derive transcriptional patterns and global trends.

RESULTS
sequencing statistics
in order to test the reproducibility of the sequencing process, two technical replicates of barcoded libraries of two conditions were generated, spinach medium and lb-nitrite. after cdna-synthesis the libraries were split and treated independently and the rpkm values of each replicate were compared. the correlation coefficient r <dig> was analyzed as described in haas et al. <cit>  in reads per gene. since the correlation was excellent , as had also been observed for other ngs experiments , we combined those technical replicates for further expression analysis. next, biological reproducibility was tested by sequencing replicates of the lb reference and the radish sprout condition on two different sequencing platforms solid and illumina. despite massive differences in library making techniques and in the sequencing strategy of both platforms, we obtained a high correlation of r <dig> =  <dig>  . this verified that the observed changes in gene regulation were not due to technical or experimental artifacts.figure  <dig> 
comparison of technical and biological replicates. a: the technical replicate was generated from spinach medium by splitting the libraries before pcr of solid sequencing. the mapped counts were normalized and are given in fragments/gene according to haas et al. . the correlation coefficient r
 <dig> is virtually  <dig> . b: biological replicates for lb medium are shown. they were sequenced on two different platforms, the solid  <dig>  system and the illumina miseq sequencer, to exclude technical artifacts of one platform. the correlation coefficient r
 <dig> is  <dig> .



taking all sequencing results together,  <dig>  million high quality reads mapped to the ehec genome and to the plasmid po <dig> . since total rna contains up to 95% rrna  <cit> , this rna species was depleted before sequencing. however, averaged over all conditions,  <dig> % of the sequenced rna is remaining rrna . about  <dig> % of all reads mapped to the plasmid . the plasmid is  <dig>  bp in length, which is about  <dig> % of the  <dig> ,445 bp genome. assuming a comparable transcription of genome and plasmid encoded genes, we calculate the number of plasmid po <dig> in a single bacterial cell to be in parity with the genome.table  <dig>

background transcription and silent genes
random transcription, also called background transcription or transcriptional noise, has been reported in ngs studies of prokaryotes and eukaryotes . single reads distribute all over the genome and are found in coding regions, non-coding regions and antisense to annotated genes. most of such reads apparently do not form transcriptional units, i.e. they do not originate from non-annotated genes for most cases. it is unclear whether the reads occur due to background noise introduced during deep sequencing experiments or whether they are caused by the low information content of bacterial promoters, resulting in “sloppy” transcription  <cit> . to see whether such reads mapped simply by chance to the ehec genome, the rna-seq data of lb medium in this study was mapped to the mouse y-chromosome . out of  <dig> million reads, only one matched to the mouse genome sequence, thus all reads appear to be specific.

generally, transcriptional noise is disregarded as non-functional. however, background transcription interferes with the detection of weakly transcribed genes. several attempts were made to estimate a threshold to consider a gene as being active. filiatrault et al. <cit>  used proteomics data to estimate a threshold for an active gene in comparison with rna-seq. mortazavi et al. <cit>  already estimated an upper bound of background noise in mouse transcriptomes by estimating the rpkm of all regions outside of exons or other transcribed regions, but this inevitably includes non-annotated genes causing a higher upper bound. however, mostly cut-off values have been selected intuitively. for instance, beaume et al. <cit>  defined a gene as being significantly active if its transcription is higher than  <dig>  of the average sequencing coverage. the disadvantage of all methods applied hitherto is that weakly transcribed genes are below the threshold.

to detect weakly transcribed genes an estimate of a threshold of background transcription was performed for ehec in order to define a gene as being active. to derive such a threshold value, the background transcription level under different conditions was observed using manually selected regions of the genome which are devoid of annotated genes and any conspicuous transcriptional patterns. these regions comprise a total of  <dig>  bp or about 2% of the genome . table  <dig> lists the rpkm values of background transcription for each condition. the average rpkm value for all conditions, including the biological replicates, is  <dig>  . in order to see if the “rpkm of the background transcription” is dependent on the sequencing technology used , we analyzed an additional data set from ehec prepared according to the illumina technology . the average background rpkm of  <dig>  was found to be in a similar range compared to the eleven conditions sequenced with the solid technology. thus, the mean level of background transcription compares to a 750 bp stretch of dna covered by one read in a sequenced library of  <dig> million reads in ehec.

for each gene, the probability whether its reads result from background or from activity above background, was calculated . of  <dig>  annotated genes, the activity of  <dig>  was found to be significantly above background , thus they do not originate from the noise .

filtering for transcriptionally inactive genes at any of the conditions studied, we found only  <dig> inactive genes which is about  <dig> % of the annotated genes . these genes are covered by no read under any of the conditions investigated.  <dig> % of the silent genes are hypothetical genes, indicating a potential over-annotation. on the other hand, some hypothetical genes might only be active at conditions not yet probed.we considered a gene as being regulated if its logfc was ≥  <dig> or ≤ − <dig> under at least one condition. accordingly, the number of regulated genes is about 4% higher for the known genes compared to the hypothetical genes .figure  <dig> 
percentage of regulated hypothetical and known genes. the category of hypothetical genes includes all genes that are annotated as hypothetical protein . all other genes are included in the category of known genes . we consider a gene as regulated if its logfc is ≥  <dig> or ≤ − <dig> in at least one condition. a gene is silent if the rpkms in all conditions are below the threshold for random transcription. consequently, silent genes are also not regulated.



overall comparison of transcriptomes
it was observed that the number of active genes differs for different conditions . in feces, the number of active genes is more than  <dig>  genes lower compared to sprouts, although both conditions have about the same sequencing depth. this is important since differences in numbers of active genes could have originated from different sequencing depths as this influences the chance of finding a transcript. we show that such an effect of the sequencing depth does indeed influence the number of genes which will be defined as active : the number of active genes asymptotically reaches saturation with an increase in sequencing depth. the same pattern was observed by haas et al. <cit> , also for ehec edl <dig>  vivancos et al. <cit>  show a similar effect for rna-seq in mycoplasma pneumonia and mus musculus. however, the sequencing depth for ehec grown on radish sprouts and feces is about the same. therefore, the major difference observed must be of biological significance. we assume that survival of ehec on radish sprouts requires a larger number of active genes than persistence in cattle feces since the cells have to deal with many environmental factors such as differing water activities, osmotic stress, radiation, temperature changes and low nutrient contents which are not present in cattle feces.figure  <dig> 
correlation of sequencing depth and number of active genes. active genes are defined as genes with a probability ≤  <dig>  to originate from background transcription. additionally, the number of active genes is shown with an rpkm of  <dig> . an averaged correlation for each data set is shown using a logarithmic trend line.



with only  <dig> active genes, lb-antibiotics has the lowest number of active genes of all. in comparison, the reference condition lb displays around  <dig> active genes . admittedly, lb-antibiotics has the lowest sequencing depth of all. however, as can be seen from figure  <dig>  the number of active genes is disproportionately low. after antibiotic treatment the cells elongate several times their original cell length. the indirect block of dna synthesis influences their regulational pattern. genes of many different pathways are turned off. we visualized this transcriptional pattern of lb-antibiotics in the heat map distance tree . the up-regulated genes  and down-regulated genes  do not form the regulatory clusters observed in the other ten conditions: lb-antibiotics forms an outer group . the extreme stress leads to most severe transcriptomic differences. interestingly, it is the only lb-condition not clustering together with the other lb-based experiments. the four conditions that do not originate from lb medium, i.e. spinach medium, minimal medium, and feces, show a more related regulational pattern. radish sprouts are closer to the conditions which originated from lb medium. we assume the high similarity of minimal medium and spinach medium as being due to a low nutrient content in both conditions. lb-ph <dig> and lb-nitrite have the most similar transcriptomic pattern, despite lb-nitrite being slightly acidic .figure  <dig>

transcriptional activity of hypothetical genes
we examined the transcriptional regulation of the  <dig> protein-coding genes  for the genome and plasmid in ehec . out of these genes,  <dig> are not in cogs , have a general function prediction only or are annotated as hypothetical . of the annotated genes on the genome,  <dig> % are hypothetical. table  <dig> shows a summary of active hypotheticals for each condition. in total,  <dig> % of them are active in at least one condition . formerly, most experiments using e. coli refer to standard lb at ph <dig> or minimal medium. we hypothesized to find additional uniquely up-regulated hypothetical genes under non-standard laboratory conditions. concentrating on highly regulated genes by using very stringent cut-off thresholds only , we found  <dig> hypothetical genes in lb with antibiotics,  <dig> in minimal medium,  <dig> in feces, nine on radish sprouts, and nine in spinach medium. in contrast, three hypothetical genes are active in lb at 15°c, three in lb at ph <dig>  two on solid lb, one in lb with nitrite, and none on lb at ph <dig> . we performed a blast search  to evaluate the taxonomic distribution of these genes. hits with an e value threshold of 10− <dig> or lower were taken as indicator for the maximal taxonomic distribution of this gene. according to this definition,  <dig> hypothetical genes are present only within the genus escherichia,  <dig> within enterobacteriaceae,  <dig> within proteobacteria,  <dig> within bacteria, and  <dig> within “cellular organisms”, respectively.table  <dig>

transcription of virulence genes
the lee  pathogenicity island comprises  <dig> genes responsible for the attachment of ehecs to mammalian host cells and effacing lesions  <cit> . table  <dig>  summarizes their regulation. the most prominent up-regulated lee gene is the secreted effector protein gene espz  in minimal medium . it interacts with several host proteins . the extremely high transcription level of espz in minimal medium is quite surprising since it is the only medium completely lacking host cell related compounds. most other lee genes encoding the type iii secretion system  , some translocated proteins like espg , esph , intimin , transcriptional regulators , and the chaperone cesd  also display high transcript levels  in minimal medium and are also active in lb-antibiotics .table  <dig>

furthermore,  <dig> non-lee encoded, virulence associated genes  <cit>  were found to be up-regulated in the absence of a host . several of them locate to prophages and are secreted effector proteins. similar to the lee encoded genes, expression levels of most of these  <dig> additional genes are highest in lb medium. the remaining, especially in feces, have logfcs between  <dig> and  <dig> under other conditions compared to lb. we assume that lb’s ingredients, a tryptic digest of casein and yeast extract from autolysates, mimics vertebrate host-like conditions. stress, like alkaline ph and nitrite, completely represses the induction of all lee genes and many other virulence genes. furthermore, these virulence-associated genes appear not to be active on radish sprouts as well as in spinach medium at the time point of harvest. though ehecs are known to proliferate on plant surfaces  <cit> , the ttss seems to play no role in a prolonged ehec-plant interaction.

gene expression in the presence of antibiotics
lb-antibiotics is the condition with the lowest number of active genes. among the highly up-regulated genes , 70% originate from prophages cp-933h, cp-933k, bp933w, cp-933c, cp-933x, cp-933u, and cp-933v. interestingly, lb-antibiotics is the condition with the highest number of hypothetical genes being induced. sixteen of the  <dig> highly antibiotic-induced hypotheticals are encoded by prophages. z <dig> and z <dig> are from prophage cp-933h and have high similarities to phage tail fiber proteins. the other  <dig> genes originate from different prophages and their function is unknown. however, they were also active after treatment with norfloxacin  <cit> . z <dig> was also identified after a human infection using the in vivo-induced antigen technology . for the other hypotheticals, no experimental data exist. by a bioinformatic approach, z <dig> was identified as a secreted effector protein, espy5’  <cit> . while most prophages of escherichia coli o157:h <dig> are regarded to be defective, asadulghani et al. <cit>  reported that these phages are still inducible. antibiotics activate the sos-response, thereby inducing phage replication. therefore, it is not surprising that a higher number of phage-borne hypothetical genes are active.

it is known that the treatment of an ehec infection with antibiotics may potentiate the severity of the disease. among clinically applied antibiotics, the combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole seems to be the worst choice  <cit> . interestingly, this antibiotic mixture strongly induces transcription of cp-933v and bp-933w. these two phages encode the shiga-toxins which contribute essentially to the clinical symptoms of an infection  <cit> . their activation provides a direct explanation for the high rate in clinical complications. furthermore, the lee pathogenicity island is also active in lb-antibiotics . in some studies, a connection of the regulation of phages and the lee pathogenicity island was found . phage-encoded regulators have effects on the activity of ttss and lee genes respectively.

the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is considered a major reservoir of escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> . however, no transcriptomes under this condition have been reported. we could detect several genes up regulated in feces compared to lb . a highly up-regulated gene in cattle feces is glgs with a logfc of  <dig> . it is a central gene in glycogen metabolism: this metabolite accumulates under starvation  <cit> . other highly active metabolic enzymes are idi , a key enzyme of isoprenoid pathways, and caia . the latter is involved in the metabolism of l-carnitine, a ubiquitous compound in eukaryotic tissues, which is metabolized to γ-butyrobetaine in e. coli <cit> .table  <dig>

many up-regulated genes are either involved in macromolecule-protection or associated to membrane stress. one example is the up-regulated phage shock regulon pspedcba  which is known to respond to certain stress conditions such as phage attack, heat shock, hyperosmotic stress, or exposure to hydrophobic organic solvents  <cit> . further, the co-chaperones dnak  and dnaj  are active in feces with logfcs of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. these chaperones are essential for the folding of newly synthesized proteins or refolding of misfolded proteins  <cit> . a similar function in disaggregation and reactivation of proteins has the chaperone clpb . a high logfc of these chaperone genes should indicate cellular stress. other active stress related genes include tus, encoding a dna replication termination protein  <cit> , furthermore, yebg, which is involved in dna-damage repair, and in addition the ibpab operon, which plays a role in the recognition of aggregated proteins  <cit> .

membrane stress is indicated by cpxp , a small protein located in the periplasm. the protein interacts with the cpx-regulon, a two component signal transduction system responsible for sensing envelope stress  <cit> . htpx, a member of the σ <dig> heat-shock regulon, is involved in the degradation and dislocation of unassembled membrane proteins  <cit> . the highest up-regulation of this gene in feces indicates the presence of membrane stress. interestingly, many of the up-regulated hypothetical genes in cattle feces also contain membrane domains.

hypothetical genes active in cattle feces
thirteen hypotheticals are only induced in cattle feces with a logfc higher than  <dig> . z <dig> and z <dig> are unknown genes which have never been reported to be active under any condition before. as in radish sprouts, several up-regulated genes are involved in biofilm formation, e.g. ycdt. interestingly, the hypothetical gene z <dig> is similar to membrane proteins, probably involved in the uptake of host derived compounds. z <dig> has high similarities to uidc of escherichia coli e <dig>  belonging to the uidrabc operon which is involved in the metabolism of glucuronate, a molecule present in the gut  <cit> . furthermore, there is experimental evidence based on in vivo-induced antigen technology  for escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  that z <dig> is also active during human infection  <cit> .

in summary, most of the highly active genes in cattle feces are connected to membrane stress or involved in the protection or reactivation of proteins. based on these findings we suggest that ehec may be under considerable environmental stress in the colon of ruminants.

after growth on radish sprouts ,  <dig> genes have significantly different transcript levels  compared to lb medium. a distinctive pattern of genes with high transcription levels includes genes active in the degradation of fructose fruakb , trehalose otsab , and arabinose araahgf , including z3511-z3513/z <dig> . ehecs are able to utilize these plant-specific carbon sources. plants are known to exudate certain carbon sources and other substances from their roots to maintain a certain microbiome, which in turn provides the plants with micronutrients  <cit> .figure  <dig>

response to stress
we assign azoreductase azor  to the stress related genes. azo dyes are a class of colorants used in chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. they are carcinogenic and can cause severe environmental problems  <cit> . bacterial azoreductases can reduce these dyes in a nadh dependent reaction  <cit> . however, azo dyes are human made compounds. the environmental role of azoreductase is unknown  <cit> . as we measured high levels of transcripts on sprouts , we speculate on a role of this enzyme in detoxification of secondary plant metabolites directed against, or modulating, the bacterial microbiome. indeed, liu et al. <cit>  found that azor protects e. coli against thiol-specific stresses caused by electrophilic quinones.

up-regulation  of aquaporin aqpz  on radish sprouts may indicate hypoosmotic stress  <cit>  since aquaporins are proteins conducting water , but only about one quarter of the bacterial species possess an aqpz homolog. the role of aqpz in osmotic regulation is under debate due to conflicting data . however, tanghe et al. <cit>  hypothesize that transport of other small uncharged molecules besides water may play a role associated with certain lifestyles or ecological niches.

a membrane stress response  <cit>  of ehec on sprouts is supported by the high activity of the phage shock genes pspabc and pspg  with logfcs between  <dig> and  <dig> on radish sprouts, perhaps indicating that secondary plant metabolites secreted by the radish sprouts may impair membrane integrity. further, we identified an up-regulated membrane protein  and a quercetinase homolog . the flavonoid quercetin is widely distributed in plants and potentially toxic. thus, yhhw may be involved in its detoxification  <cit> .

another up-regulated gene  indicative of a stress response is the acid shock protein precursor asra . this small protein localizes in the periplasm and is further processed to a 8 kda fragment, which is the active form of this proposed chaperone  <cit> . it appears that low ph is only a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, to induce asra as it is not active in acidified lb-nitrite. in addition, osmotic stress also induces asra <cit> .

finally, naru  encodes a protein forming a single channel for nitrate uptake and nitrite extrusion  <cit> . it is strongly up-regulated  on radish sprouts and only to a logfc of  <dig>  in lb-nitrite.

adhesion to the plant surface
curli fiber genes are associated with adhesion to plants . these fimbriae-like structures are a major factor for the formation of biofilms and adhesion to surfaces  <cit> . the highest activity of these six genes csggfedba  was determined on radish sprouts . an additional indicator for adhesion to radish sprouts is the up-regulation of bsss , a regulatory gene for biofilm formation  <cit> . the increased transcription level of curli-related genes together with bsss corroborates the hypothesis of fink et al.  <cit>  that lettuce leaves are colonized by using curli fibers and by fine tuning biofilm formation.

we identified nine hypothetical genes in radish sprouts with a logfc higher than  <dig>  which are only active on sprouts . one of those, yjfy, was already found induced on lettuce leaves  <cit> . this gene is also active in biofilm growth  <cit> . we found additional hypotheticals that play a role in biofilm formation, which are summarized in table  <dig> including references for them.figure  <dig>

radish sprouts as a reservoir of ehec?
sprouts were inoculated with  <dig> × 102 cfu/g plant ehec and grown for several days. the growth curve in figure 5a illustrates that ehec grows very well on the plants, reaching  <dig> × 107 cfu/g plant, apparently without affecting the plant phenotype. as shown above, ehec expresses many unique genes when it thrives on the plant surface, including adhesin, membrane proteins, transport proteins, metabolic proteins and a variety of stress response proteins. we conclude that radish sprouts are a suitable habitat for ehec to proliferate. however, this experiment reflects a mono-association of ehec and radish sprouts and, therefore, does not yet allow a conclusion whether plants in general serve as a natural reservoir of ehec.

ehec as “vegetarian”?
obviously, ehec is able to survive and proliferate on and in plants. this has now been shown several times by different groups . however, after ehec had been described as a pathogen in  <dig>  it was dubbed “hamburger disease”, since many outbreaks were related to undercooked minced meat. for quite some time more or less the only reservoir considered for pathogenic enterobacteria was meat, milk, and products thereof  <cit> . however, in hindsight, a possible “vegetarian” life style of ehec should have been considered years ago, since ehec contains genes to metabolize different sugars : fruakb for fructose, otsab for trehalose, and araahgf for arabinose. using blast, we found that plant pathogens or plant associated genera, such as ralstonia, xanthomonas, erwinia, rhizobium, and dickeya also contain such operons. next, ehec forms biofilms on plant surfaces using curli. again, species of rahnella and serratia contain csga. the quercetinase homolog yhhw found in ehec is also present in pectobacterium carotovorum, and serratia proteamaculans. stress related ehec-genes induced while growing on sprouts, such as asr and pspabcg, are found in burkholderia gladioli, and pectobacterium species. finally, as shown in this paper, azor is induced in ehec when growing on radish and azor-homologs are found in species of serratia, erwinia, pectobacterium, and dickeya. taking together, it would be quite interesting to scan the ehec-genome for homologous genes from other bacteria, which are known to be induced in the respective niche of each bacterium and to see, if ehec can thrive in this niche as well and which genes are induced. strand-specific transcriptomes supply an excellent technique to substantiate such hypotheses.

CONCLUSIONS
distinguishing weakly transcribed genes from background transcription is a general problem in ngs transcriptomics. our proposed statistical method is based on the data of the actual experiment, thus also takes the sequencing depth into account. genes are classified into “active” or “inactive”, based on a sound statistical evaluation and not on arbitrarily chosen threshold values of reads or rpkm. we sequenced biological replicates of transcriptomes using the solid and the illumina system and showed a high correlation between both approaches, confirming that the solid and illumina system produce equivalent data. this is interesting insofar as pcr-artifacts and other biased reactions during library preparation are a possible source of the uneven coverage of a given gene with reads. however, when comparing relative transcription , these effects apparently tend to cancel each other out. otherwise, there would be no or only weak correlation between data gained with the solid and the illumina system.

we discovered a unique set of active genes for each condition tested and, remarkably, most genes of ehec appear to be active under at least one condition. indeed, under environmental conditions more hypothetical genes were found to be active than in standard lab media. this is not too surprising, since growth of e. coli in standard medium has been examined over and over again. interestingly, only a minority of genes  were not active under any condition tested by us. we therefore suggest that the general assumption that large numbers of genes are over-annotated in bacterial genomes may be wrong. in addition, such genes might be active in habitats not yet probed. finally, azor exemplarily shows that transcriptome profiling still is and will be a powerful technique to find new roles for genes. azor was formerly only known to destroy artificial azo-dyes, but its high induction on plants suggests a detoxification role in nature. this finding provides an entry point to test natural plant substances for azor induction and to observe growth  of an Δazor mutant to further elucidate the behavior of ehec and other pathogens in nature. similarly, other highly induced or repressed genes are now new candidates for a detailed functional description.
