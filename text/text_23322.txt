BACKGROUND
apricot  is a typical drupe of the family rosaceae with eight pairs of chromosomes   <cit> . cultivated apricots are widely cultivated around the world  and apricot production has a relatively high economic value. apricot fruit has rich nutritional value, including dietary fiber, organic acids, vitamin c, carotene, and trace elements  <cit> . furthermore, the kernel is a natural plant protein resource, which used as medicine and food  <cit> .

the pericarp develops from the ovary, and the innermost layer is the endocarp. the hardened endocarp has a vital role in seed protection and dispersal in some important economic fruits, such as peach, apricot, plum, almond, cherry, mango, olive, and coffee  <cit> . in plant evolution, the function of the heavily lignified endocarp is to ensure secure environment for seed development  <cit> . endocarp hardening is a significant trait of mature drupe fruits. it is caused by the secondary wall formation and lignin deposition  <cit> . biochemical analysis has found that the endocarps of olive and peach contained much more lignin than poplar stem  <cit> , suggesting that a relatively extreme degree of secondary wall formation occurs in fruit endocarp tissues. lignin is an aromatic polymer that is widely found in the secondary walls of plants, as well as most enzymes and regulatory steps in the lignin biosynthetic pathway  have been identified  <cit> . endocarp lignification in arabidopsis has been adequately studied in relation to dehiscence, and even the transcriptional regulatory network has also been examined  <cit> . for drupe fruits, ryugo  <cit>  observed the regulation of lignin biosynthesis and accumulation in peach stones in the early 1960s. lignification in peach endocarp is a highly coordinated process, which has been shown by subsequent developmental studies  <cit> . recently, a transcriptional network dominated by nac and myb genes was observed in a well-conserved regulatory pathway, which causes arabidopsis dehiscence or peach endocarp formation  <cit> , and plays an essential role in the secondary wall formation and lignification via stimulating the pathway. furthermore, several mads-box genes involved in the formation of fruit endocarp, including shp <dig>  shp <dig>  stk, and ful were identified  <cit> . these tfs co-function with ind, alc  <cit> , and rpl  <cit>  to stimulates endocarp differentiation.

however, there is wide variation in the phenotypes of prunus endocarps, such as thickness, hardness, and brittleness of almond endocarps. the endocarp of “split pit” peach does not seal along the suture, leaving the seed severely exposed to pests and disease  <cit> . callahan  <cit>  found a natural “stoneless” plum in a wild-type p. domestica, which had imperfectly developed endocarp resulting in a partially naked seed. china has a great wealth of germplasm genetic resources of apricot that have important breeding values  <cit> . ‘liehe’  apricot is an extremely rare cultivar that originated in linyuan city of liaoning province and was introduced into national germplasm repository for plums and apricots  in the  <dig>  <cit> . the endocarp of le apricot is thin, soft, and cleavable, and some seed partially exposed . both flesh and kernel have a tasty flavor and aroma.fig.  <dig> morphology and structure of mature fruit and endocarp of le and jg apricot in this study. left: le apricot with thin, soft and cleavable endocarp; right: jg apricot with thick, hard and complete endocarp. the scale in this figure was 5 mm




this study investigated the mechanisms of endocarp development and phenotype formation, using illumina sequencing and expression pattern analysis of candidate genes in apricot fruits during the stages of endocarp development and lignification.

RESULTS
differences in endocarp development in le and jg apricot
the growth of le apricot fruit was compared with jg apricot. the horizontal and vertical diameter of the two cultivars increased continuously during fruit development. growth patterns were similar, with formal double-sigmoid growth curves . the equation of two apricot cultivars and their first derivatives were also similar . in addition, the transcript level of aco <dig> and pepck divided the development of two apricots into same four stages . based on these patterns and fit equations, apricot fruit growth was assessed at four growth stages: s <dig>  first exponential growth stage ; s <dig>  slow-growth stage ; s <dig>  second exponential growth culminating in fruit ripening stage ; s <dig>  fruit ripening stage . the changes in the growth pattern during fruit development in le and jg apricot were almost the same.fig.  <dig> the changes of weight and growth curves of le and jg apricot during fruit development stages. in a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  points and solid lines represent actual measured values, and the dotted line represent fit curves of equation. in a <dig>  b <dig>  c <dig>  two different lines are fit curves of the first derivative of equations. numbers under the x–axis indicate the days after full bloom. s <dig>  first exponential growth stage; s <dig>  slow–growth stage; s <dig>  second exponential growth culminating in fruit ripening stage; s <dig>  fruit ripening stage. error bars indicate the standard deviation of ten biological replications. label: ‘*’ means the significant differences at p <  <dig>  by dmrt




flower buds, flowers and young fruits of le and jg apricot were examined to investigate the features of the innermost layer of the apricot ovary . the innermost wall of the flower bud and flower ovary were smooth and normal, even in the early endocarp of young fruit with no obvious differences. however, at  <dig> dafb, endocarp of le apricot started to cleave, and these areas increased along with the progression in fruit development, which occurred in virtually each replicate sample of le apricot. endocarp thickness was significantly different after  <dig> dafb subsequently , when cleaving areas of endocarp became more obvious in le apricot .fig.  <dig> observation of development and lignification of the endocarp in le and jg apricot. a microscopic observation of flowers and young fruits of two cultivars, the scale was 2 mm. b observation of lignin deposition in two cultivars’ fruit, the scale was 5 mm. c changes of endocarp vertical sectional areas in le and jg apricot. ‘ca’ represent the cleaving areas of le endocarp. d changes of endocarp lignin content in le and jg apricot. e changes of endocarp thickness in le and jg apricot. f the carve of first derivative of the endocarp thickness equation. numbers under x–axis indicate the days after full bloom. error bars indicate standard deviation of ten biological replications. label: ‘*’ means the significant differences at p <  <dig>  by dmrt




the lignin deposition process was discernible from fruit transverse sections  showing color reaction between the phloroglucinol and lignin . the lignin deposition process began at the tip of the endocarp and gradually completed over 25 days . interestingly, le cultivar exhibited incomplete areas of endocarp that had little or no lignification . the thickness and lignin content were significantly lower in le endocarp, which estimated by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively; out of that in jg endocarp . thus the differences in endocarp development and lignification were significant.

illumina sequencing and assembly
the le endocarp cleaving occurred at  <dig> dafb and rapidly increased at  <dig> dafb . thus, rna from these two fruits stages of le and jg apricot was used for rna-seq, with two replicates per fruit, which generated  <dig> , <dig>  raw reads. after removing low-quality reads and trimming adapter sequences,  <dig> , <dig> remained . the assembly data were confirmed by an n <dig> value  and average length . the number of transcripts  was  <dig> , constituting  <dig> % of the total, with average lengths of  <dig>  bp . transcripts assembled  <dig>  genes from le and jg apricot. among these genes,  <dig>  had lengths of ≥1000 bp, constituting  <dig> %  of the total . length distribution of all genes is shown in table <dig> table  <dig> summary of rna–seq and de novo assembly of p. armeniaca l. unigenes

functional annotation and identification of unigenes
based on the sequence similarity,  <dig>  genes were matched to the japanese apricot and peach genome databases . all of these genes were aligned using blastx  searches against the nr, swiss-port, go, cog, and kog protein databases, and kegg pathway databases. a total of  <dig>   genes had more than one match, and  <dig> % were annotated to the nr database . among the annotated genes in the nr database,  <dig> % had an e-value ≤ <dig>  e− <dig> and showed very strong homology to the gene sequence in the database. the remaining  <dig> % of genes had an e-value ranging from  <dig>  e− <dig> to  <dig>  e− <dig> . we further analyzed the blast results in the nr database and investigated the best-hit species distribution, and the top two matched plant species were p. mume  and p. persica  .table  <dig> summary of assembled p. armeniaca l. unigenes

the functions of predicted genes were classified by go analysis. a total of  <dig>  genes annotated in the go database were categorized into  <dig> functional groups, belonging to three main go ontologies: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions . ‘metabolic process’ , were dominant among the functional groups.

in addition, assembled genes were searched against the cog database to estimate the gene function . in general,  <dig> putative proteins were clustered into  <dig> functional categories. among these categories, ‘general function prediction only’  accounted for the largest amount, followed by ‘replication, recombination and repair’  and ‘transcription’ . in addition,  <dig> % of assembled genes were assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism, reflecting the large amount of secondary metabolites that were present in the apricot. the ‘nuclear structure’ , ‘cell motility’ , and ‘chromatin structure and dynamics’  accounted for the least amounts.fig.  <dig> cog classification of assembled p. armeniaca l. unigenes




we used the kegg pathway database to search the functional networks of biological interactions. in total,  <dig> genes were identified in the kegg database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the majority of genes was classified into pathways for ‘carbohydrate metabolism’ , ‘translation’ , ‘amino acid metabolism’ , or ‘folding, sorting and degradation’ . biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites matched  <dig> genes.

the expression patterns of the genes among le <dig>  le <dig>  jg <dig>  and jg <dig> were calculated using the fpkm method. a total of  <dig> degs were identified by comparing the four libraries in paired comparisons, as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the most prominent library was le1_vs_jg <dig>  in each library, le1_vs_le <dig>  le1_vs_jg <dig>  jg1_vs_jg <dig>  and le2_vs_jg <dig> had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> degs respectively. four libraries had  <dig> common degs and  <dig> degs in le1_vs_le <dig>  as well as  <dig> degs in le1_vs_jg <dig>   <dig> degs in jg1_vs_jg <dig>  and  <dig> degs in le2_vs_jg <dig>  these results indicated that early fruit development of apricot is a highly active process, and key genes that are related to endocarp development were significantly expressed.fig.  <dig> degs statistics and venn diagrams between different cdna libraries. red color indicates up–regulated expression of degs; green color indicates down–regulated expression of degs. l <dig> and j1: the degs were generated from le relative to jg cultivar at  <dig> dafb; l <dig> and j2: the degs of le relative to jg cultivar at  <dig> dafb. jg was always control sample




transcript differences between le and jg apricot
endocarp cleaving and incomplete lignin deposition in the fruit of le apricot were highly complex phenomena that caused by a series of biological processes, including many genes acting synergistically, collaborating in regulating various pathways. however, the phenylpropanoid pathway is undoubtedly one of the most important. endocarp hardening occurs via secondary cell wall formation and lignification. in the phenylpropanoid pathway, p-coumaryl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and coniferyl alcohol are the end products that form the different types of lignin monomers  <cit> . from the kegg enrichment analysis, phenylalanine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and hormone signal transduction were the foremost pathways and contained the most number of degs in le1_vs_jg <dig> . thirty-four degs associated with the phenylalanine pathway were differentially expressed.

the expression level of genes which involved in phenylpropanoid pathway was down-regulated in le compared with jg cultivar, in both the replicates and development stages . these included genes encoding shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  , caffeic acid o-methyltransferase  . among the seven annotated peroxidase  genes, two were down-regulated  in le relative jg cultivar. cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase   in particular, were involved in lignin biosynthesis and catalyzed the final step specific to the production of lignin monomers  <cit> . the expression level of cad was always down-regulated in le relative to jg cultivar during s <dig> stage. the fold change data of each selected candidate gene in the phenylpropanoid pathway are shown in fig.  <dig>  and detailed information is presented in table  <dig> table  <dig> degs between le and jg apricot that involved in phenylpropanoid pathway

several tfs were identified that mediated the endocarp development, including shp and stk. alc and ind promoted endocarp differentiation and negative regulation was achieved by ful and rpl. meanwhile, nst <dig>  nst <dig>  and several myb-box genes are associated with secondary wall formation and lignin biosynthesis. by the rna-seq, the majority of these tfs and genes were identified and showed in fig.  <dig>  the expression of shp, ful, and myb <dig> were up-regulated in le relative to jg cultivar. however, stk, myb46– <dig>  myb46– <dig>  and nst <dig> were down-regulated significantly in le compared with jg cultivar .table  <dig> degs between le and jg apricot that involved in secondary wall biosynthesis




we used common expression patterns to further analyze the degs between le and jg apricot at  <dig> and  <dig> dafb. based on this method,  <dig> degs were placed into seven clusters . most of the candidate degs was categorized in either cluster  <dig>  or cluster  <dig> . compared with jg apricot, the expression of degs of le apricot was up-regulated in cluster  <dig>  and some degs were present as chs <dig>  f3h, cslg <dig>  csla <dig>  katam, arr <dig>  and arr <dig> . conversely, the expression of degs such as dfr and xth <dig> in le apricot was down-regulated in cluster  <dig> fig.  <dig> common expression analysis based on degs expression patterns. left: numbers under the x-axis indicated different sample, numbers under the y-axis indicated the log <dig>  right: red color represents higher log <dig> data of genes; green color represents lower log <dig> data of genes. black color represents log2 =  <dig>  le1– <dig> and le1– <dig> indicate two biological replications of le at  <dig> dafb; le2– <dig> and le2– <dig> indicate two biological replications of le at  <dig> dafb; jg1– <dig> and jg1– <dig> indicate two biological replications of jg at  <dig> dafb; jg2– <dig> and jg2– <dig> indicate biological replications of jg at  <dig> dafb




there was a linear correlation  between rna-seq data and qpcr in our study . tfs  and key candidate genes could regulate fruit endocarp growth, development, and lignification . these genes involved in the biosynthesis of plant hormones , phenylpropanoid pathway , flavonoid biosynthesis , and cellulose-related pathway . stk, nst <dig>  ga3ox <dig>  hct, comt and cad were down-regulated and myb <dig> was up-regulated in le apricot, compared with jg, in rna-seq data and gene expression, respectively. furthermore, pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant association between cad expression and endocarp thickness in le apricot at the  <dig>  level. hct expression and lignin content also showed the same result . the special endocarp development and lignification in le were caused by the effects of several tfs and genes involved in phenylpropanoid pathway.fig.  <dig> qpcr analyses of selected candidate genes involved in this study. light–colored bars indicate le apricot; dark–colored bars indicate jg apricot. numbers under the x–axis indicate the days after full bloom. label: ‘*’ means the significant differences at p <  <dig>  by dmrt




discussion
the hardened endocarp has a vital role in seed protection and dispersal in some important economic fruits, such as peach, apricot, plum, almond, cherry, mango, olive, and coffee  <cit> . endocarp hardening is a significant trait of fruit matures of any types of drupes, which caused by the secondary wall formation and lignin deposition  <cit> . phenylpropanoid biosynthesis played a crucial role in endocarp lignification in both le and jg apricot. sequence analysis of transcriptome revealed a series of differentially expressed genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, such as 4cl, hct, comt and cad. knockout of 4cl in arabidopsis had no significant effect on either lignin content or monomeric composition  <cit> . however, rnai silencing of hcl in arabidopsis and radiata pine reduced lignin content and changed the monomeric composition  <cit> . in comt antisense leucaena leucocephala, the lignin content was reduced to 72% by decreasing 60% of omt activity  <cit> . cad <dig> made a significant contribution to the synthesis of coniferyl alcohol, and down-regulated cad <dig> in wild-type tobacco has a moderate impact on g unit content of the non-condensed lignin fraction  <cit> . cad activities were drastically reduced in null mutants of arabidopsis , and affected sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity in these mutants. atcad-d had an significant influence on lignin content and proportion of conventional s lignin  <cit> . in le cultivar, expression of 4cl were up-regulated, yet expressions of hcl and comt were down-regulated, which relative to jg cultivar . in particular, cad expressed down-regulated in le apricot compared with jg, in both rna-seq data and relative gene expression . these results indicated that thickness and incomplete endocarp are unlikely to result from mutation of one specific phenylpropanoid pathway gene. in fact, expression levels of cad and hct had significant correlation with endocarp thickness and lignin content in le apricot . these genes or tfs may be responsible for the defects in endocarp development and lignification in le apricot.


shp, stk and nst <dig> were specifically expressed in endocarp of peach. in exocarp and mesocarp, the negative regulator ful exhibited a high expression level. however, the expression of ind and alc was insignificant  <cit> . in arabidopsis stk shp <dig> shp <dig> triple mutants, the integuments were changed into carpel-like structures leading to complete sterility  <cit> . over-expression of ful caused no lignin deposition in valve tissues in arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore, in tomato, over-expression of ful <dig> lead to a thinner pericarp, and reduced stem cell layer  <cit> . in a split pit resistant variety of peach, shp expression was low, however in the sensitive variety, ful expression was significantly elevated  <cit> . our analysis found that stk, shp, and ful were discovered in degs, but ind and alc were not. expression of shp and ful had significant different between le and jg at  <dig> dafb, while stk remained down-regulated during the s <dig> stage significantly. rna-seq data and qpcr analysis reflected that shp, stk, and ful were highly expressed and essential for endocarp development . ind directly activates ga3ox <dig>  which is an indispensable enzyme catalyzing the last step of gas biosynthesis in the separation layer of arabidopsis. ind induces gas accumulation to degrade della protein, resulting in release alc  <cit> . in atga3ox <dig> atga3ox <dig> double mutants of arabidopsis, synthesis of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin were suppressed obviously  <cit> . nst <dig> and nst <dig>  have been proven as master switches that regulate the secondary wall biosynthesis and lignification in arabidopsis  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . in the transcriptional network, the downstream transcription factor mybs is activated by nst <dig> and snd <dig>  and multiple genes are involved in secondary wall biosynthesis  <cit> . in nst <dig> mutants, valve margins were obvious in the absence of the secondary wall, meanwhile in nst <dig> nst <dig> double mutants, only vascular vessels conserved secondary wall formation  <cit> . the snd <dig>  and vnd1– <dig>  vnd6– <dig> were not detected as degs in this study. the expression levels of vnd <dig> were always lower in le relative to jg cultivar at  <dig> and 21 days after full bloom . nst <dig>  the domain of that regulates biosynthesis of secondary wall, lignin and xylanase always had low expression levels in le fruit . this might be one of the main cause of cleaving and thinning of endocarp in le apricot. hence, nst <dig> was regarded as an essential candidate gene in the development and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in endocarp of le apricot. myb <dig> is also a decisive master switch and atmyb <dig> was reported to be a direct target of anac012/snd1/nst <dig>  <cit> , which adjusted secondary cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . dominant repression or over-expression of myb <dig> has a considerable effect on secondary wall thickening of fibers and vessels and biosynthesis of lignin and cellulose  <cit> . we identified two differentially expressed myb <dig> . in addition, myb <dig> could activate the expression of myb <dig>  myb <dig>  and myb <dig>  <cit> , and the myb <dig> protein sequence was highly similar to that of myb <dig>  <cit> . atmyb <dig> regulates the expression of c4h, so that atmyb <dig> could negatively regulate several genes implicated in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  <cit> . trans-activation assays and transgenic studies also show that myb <dig> appears to be a negative regulator of snd <dig> expression  <cit> . interestingly, myb <dig> was extraordinary up-regulated in le, and expression of c4h down-regulated  only in le fruit. myb <dig> of apricot might also play an important part in negative regulating the lignin biosynthesis in the secondary wall.

common expression pattern analysis provided a new understanding of the expression and function of degs, and combines pathways with multiple candidate genes, which were related to the flavonoid pathway and cell function . chs <dig> and f3h expressed higher level in le than jg, which may cause by considerable down-expression of cad. however, dfr had a down-regulated expression. among  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig>  cslg <dig>  and related genes, csla <dig>  <cit>  and katam had significant higher level expression in le during stage s <dig> and s <dig> relative to jg cultivar. furthermore, arr <dig> and arr <dig> regulators appeared to act as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling  <cit> , and showed significantly up-regulated expression in le apricot.

CONCLUSIONS
our results implied that cleaving of endocarp in le apricot started at  <dig> dafb, and this area increased during fruit development. the thickness and lignin content of the mature le endocarp was only  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, compared with jg endocarp . rna-seq to sequencing and de novo assembly of the fruit transcriptomes of two cultivars of p. armeniaca  showed discrepancies in development and lignification of the endocarp and explained the cleaving of endocarp in le apricot. the degs and qpcr analysis data  identified differentially expression genes involved in tfs  and phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and hormone pathways , consistent with endocarp phenotype and lignin content. our results indicated that tfs especially nst <dig>  may regulate genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. besides, low expression level of nst <dig> may inhibit the endocarp development and lignification of le apricot.
