BACKGROUND
soil salinity-alkalinity is one of the major environmental challenges limiting crop productivity globally. for example, the western songnen plain of china, which has  <dig>  million ha of sodic land, is one of the three major contiguous sodic soil regions in the world. understanding the molecular basis of plant response under saline-alkaline conditions will facilitate biotechnology efforts to breed crop plants with enhanced tolerance to high saline-alkaline. root is an important organ for carrying water and mineral nutrients to the rest of the plant. as the primary site of perception and injury for salinity and alkaline stress, roots provide an ideal target for study of the molecular mechanism underlying plant saline-alkaline stress tolerance and adaptation  <cit> .

soybean is rich in nutraceutical compounds, e.g., isoflavone and saponins. its high symbiotic nitrogen fixing capacity  helps to replenish soil nitrogen. therefore, soybean is an ideal crop for crop rotation and intercropping. wild soybean exhibits much higher adaptability to suboptimal  natural environment compared to the cultivated soybean. the wild soybean  line used in this study can germinate and set seed in the sodic soil at ph <dig>  and survive in the nutrient solution with  <dig> mmol/l nahco <dig>  the physiological stress response of wild soybean has been described previously  <cit> . the obvious advantage of wild soybean over other extremophile model plants is that it can be directly compared with soybean cultivar to generate useful information for elucidation of plant stress tolerance and adaptation.

high throughput technologies, such as microarray, have been used to examine the gene expression patterns under various environmental cues in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> . although studies on plant sodic stress has been conducted in perennial plant leymus chinensis  <cit> , puccinellia tenuiora  <cit> , limonium bicolor  <cit>  and tamarix hispida  <cit>  using cdna array, the dynamic expression change under sodic stress is not yet available. currently, commercialization microarrays are only available for a small number of species. therefore, hybridization using a microarray for a closely related species was used and has demonstrated feasible, without discernible loss of information  <cit> . ji has demonstrated that feasible to investigate the wild soybean's gene expression profile using the affymetrix® soybean genome genechip® based on the high similarity between the two allied species by comparison between the est sequences of glycine soja and glycine max  <cit> .

in the present study, we analyzed the transcriptome changes in glycine soja roots under nahco <dig> treatments using affymetrix® soybean genome array. our objectives were threefold:  to identify genes regulated by alkaline stress,  to identify genes co-regulated in a similar pattern and their dynamic change over the course of stress treatment, and  to identify the expression feature of gene family and their function category.

RESULTS
transcriptome profiling data
the data discussed in this publication have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and are accessible through geo series accession number gse <dig> 

the assessment of duplicated microarray experiments using correlation analysis was shown in additional file  <dig>  the pearson coefficients ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . a total of  <dig> probe sets were considered present, among which  <dig> showing consistent expression patterns in the replicates  <  <dig> ) were used in the following analysis.

validation of microarray data by real-time quantitative pcr
the real-time quantitative pcr  expressions of  <dig> candidate genes relative to a reference gene, gapdh, were compared with microarray expression in figure  <dig>  although the magnitude of the transcript abundance varied between the microarray and qrt-pcr, the patterns were similar. this indicates that the cross-species hybridization obtains real expression values of glycine soja's genes.

identification of genes differentially expressed throughout the nahco <dig> stress
a total of  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed in roots under saline-alkaline stress   and their distribution at each time point was illustrated in figure  <dig>  comparisons of the kinetics of changes in expression patterns revealed four features. first,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> probe sets were significantly differentially expressed  under nahco <dig> stress at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively. the number of differentially expressed genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of total genes. the number of significantly differentially expressed genes peaked at  <dig> h and decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> h. this result is the same as the pattern found in puccinellia tenuiflor  <cit>  and limonium bicolor  <cit>  that the frequency of genes showing differential expression at  <dig> h is higher than that at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h. these suggest that the gene expressions change considerably after  <dig> h alkaline stress. in addition, it is noteworthy that the total number of differentially expressed genes and the dynamic patterns of up-regulated genes are similar to arabidopsis transcriptome profile under salt stress but differed from that under cold, drought or osmotic stimuli  <cit> . this further suggests that plants have distinctive mechanisms in coping with ionic and physical stress. second, genes up-regulated showed a trough at  <dig> h whilst, to a different extent, genes down-regulated showed a peak at  <dig> h. this indicates a biphasic response of this organ to alkaline stress, and  <dig> h is the turning point. third, almost no observable changes of transcripts were detected until after  <dig> h stress treatment. we found that it takes three hours for the roots to respond to sodic stress at transcription level. this might attribute to the timescale of molecular concentration and modifications . cellular response to extracellular signals was reported to be a time-sequential process  <cit> . the process is most likely distributed over hours and requires the involvement of both protein signaling and gene regulation. processes including changes of mrna concentrations, protein complex formation, translocation in space, conformational changes or their molecular modifications, occur on different timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds  via seconds and minutes  up to hours and days for gene expression kinetics and/or even years by epigenetic regulation. fourth,  <dig> probe sets were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. moreover, the number of down-regulated genes was greater than that of the up-regulated genes at each time point, which is contrary to the arabidopsis profile under abiotic stresses  <cit> . we presume that this may attribute to the concomitant na+, high ph, co32- and hco3- in the nahco <dig> solution. under multiple stress condition, plants suffer more severe injury than that of a single stress.

the venn diagram  showed that the number of specifically up-regulated genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of total genes at each time point. only two probe sets were constantly up-regulated and  <dig> were constantly down-regulated at  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h. one of the two up-regulated probe sets  encodes a putative phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase , which is nodule-enhanced and regulated throughout nodule development  <cit> . this protein also increases in response to increasing intracellular ph in arabidopsis  <cit> . the other one  encodes an uncharacterised protein containing regulator of chromosome condensation  domain. the rcc <dig> protein is known to be involved in the maintenance of chromatin conformation, in regulation of chromosome condensation, and in monitoring and signalling of dna replication  <cit> . the constant up regulation of this gene, which is similar to arabidopsis subjected to cold and oxidative stresses  <cit> , indicates that adjustment of chromosome structure is needed under stress condition. the number of specifically down-regulated genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of total genes at various time points.

co-expression analysis of stress regulated genes
time course analysis using a method described by storey  <cit>  revealed  <dig> probe sets  displaying significantly changed expression . hierarchical clustering of averaged expression value from two biological replicates identified  <dig> distinctive patterns for the  <dig> genes .

k-means clustering was conducted to analyze the co-expression setting and  <dig> clusters with coordinated expression patterns were identified . these clusters reflected the general trends and key transitional states during nahco <dig> stress. gene lists for each cluster, including normalized expression values, can be found in additional file  <dig>  clusters i, ii and iv contain genes down-regulated after  <dig> h, but up-regulated at different time points. differ from the other two clusters; genes in cluster iv were down-regulated after  <dig> h. clusters iii, v and viii contain genes up-regulated after  <dig> h, but down-regulated after  <dig> h. genes in cluster viii were up-regulated after  <dig> h and genes in cluster vii exhibited a more dramatic decrease after  <dig> h. in cluster vi, genes exhibited a minor decrease after  <dig> h.

functional categorization and pathway of differentially expressed genes
out of the  <dig> significantly changed probe sets, we assigned at least one go term to  <dig> probe sets based on sequence similarity. the distribution of functional categories is showed in figure  <dig>  as seen,  <dig> go over-represented  categories were: metabolism signal transduction, energy, transcription, secondary metabolism, transporter, disease and defence. these biological processes were affected by the sodic stress treatment.

to understand the relationship between response time points of transcripts and their biology meanings, go enrichment analysis  and mapman  <cit>  visualization were conducted. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  genes participate in signal transduction and secondary metabolisms were over-represented at earlier time points . these secondary metabolisms related genes, which significantly participate in phenylpropanoid, simple phenols, flavonoids, lignin and lignans, and non-mevalonate  pathway, were presented up-regulated under sodic stress . phenylpropanoid metabolism was found induced under stress   <cit> . similar to the signal transduction process, these secondary metabolisms might generate a cascade response for their early induction after stress treatment.

genes involved in metabolism, secondary metabolism, disease and defence, cell structure, intracellular traffic were induced after  <dig> h and genes involved in energy production were decreases after  <dig> h. furthermore, genes responsible for signal transduction, transcription and transporter were decreased at later time point . signal transduction and intracellular traffic were decreased at  <dig> h, while energy was induced. these observations were further supported by a more specific comparison of metabolism using mapman. this analysis showed up-regulation of several biosynthetic pathways at  <dig> h, such as terpenes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids & phenolics, tca, sucrose metabolism, lignin and lignans and non-mevalonate  pathway . the number of genes participate in secondary metabolism were found more at  <dig> h than that at  <dig> h . a further investigation was done to the ja synthesis . it was observed that lipoxygenases and oxophytodienoate reductase were up-regulated at  <dig> h, indicating that the ja synthesis pathway participates in the early response to sodic stress. several biosynthetic pathways were down-regulated at  <dig> h, such as cell wall modification, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids & phenolics and lipids metabolism pathways . a custom mapman pathway image was generated and ap2-erebp, wrky, bzip, myb and myb related, c2c <dig> and c2c2-co-like transcript factors were decreased at  <dig> h . protein synthesis were induced after  <dig> h, and most of them were plastidic, misc and proteins in the nucleotide .

the above analysis revealed a cascade process: 1) firstly, signal transduction and secondary metabolism were induced at  <dig> h; 2) as a result, metabolism, disease defense, cell structure and intracellular traffic were induced at  <dig> h; 3) after that, signal transduction, transcription and transporter decreased after  <dig> h; 4) later on, signal transduction, secondary metabolism and intracellular traffic was induced at  <dig> h, and decreased at  <dig> h; 5) after a long period of stress treatment, protein synthesis and energy were induced at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively.

detailed descriptions of genes participate in signal transduction and transcription are as follows:

signal transduction
approximately,  <dig> probe sets representing various signalling proteins, such as 14-3- <dig>  protein phosphatase, small gtpases, and protein kinases, calmodulin-binding family proteins, were up-regulated at  <dig> h and down-regulated after  <dig> h. stress tolerance or susceptibility in plants is a coordinated action of various genes including those signalling pathway components  <cit> . as expected, protein phosphatase and protein kinase were over-represented at earlier time points because reversible protein phosphorylation is a central mechanism in cellular signal transduction and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . calmodulin-binding family protein, such as calcium-dependent protein kinase or calmodulin-like domain protein kinases  are essential sensor-transducers of calcium signalling pathways in plants  <cit> . their up-regulation at the early stage endorsed the trigger of downstream components to cope with the stressful condition.

it is noteworthy that members of the 14-3- <dig> family protein were also up-regulated at the early stage of nahco <dig> stress. 14-3- <dig> family proteins, for its specific phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding activity  <cit> , are thought to be involved in a large range of abiotic signalling processes and to interact with many regulatory proteins like transcription factors, plasma membrane h+-atpase, ion channels, ascorbate peroxidase  and abscisic acid   <cit> .

transcription factors
as above, two processes, transcription and transport, emerged at earlier time points. probe sets up-regulated before  <dig> h were listed in additional file  <dig>  according to the putative annotation assigned by homology search with genes in arabidopsis gene regulatory information server  <cit> ,  <dig> transcription factors representing  <dig> different families were found to be induced at earlier stage of stress treatment . these transcription factor families were compared  to identify families playing main roles at earlier stress response.

plant wrky transcription factor superfamily are known to be involved in biotic  <cit>  and abiotic stress  <cit>  response, and in developmental processes  <cit> . however, their roles in mediating plant alkaline stress response are largely unknown. recently,  <dig> gmwrky genes were identified from soybean  <cit> , and  <dig> probe sets representing  <dig> wrky family members were quickly induced at early time point before decreasing at later time points. this pattern was similar to wrkys expression pattern in response to other biotic or abiotic stresses in numerous plant species  <cit> .

similar to the wrky superfamily, ap2-erebp family are well known for their important functions in plant growth and development, especially in hormonal regulation and in environmental stress response  <cit> . our results showed that transcripts encoding ap2-erebp family proteins increased drastically after  <dig> h, and rapidly decreased after  <dig> h of stress treatment.

although a member of gras family proteins seems to be involved in development and other processes, such as rhizobial nod factor-induce  <cit> , short-root movement <cit> , ga <dig> induction  <cit>  and drought stress  <cit> , very little is known about their physiological roles under saline or alkaline stress. the stress modulated expression of gras genes suggested they may be important in nahco <dig> stress response. a full list of gras family proteins in soybean still needs to be identified systematically.

in addition, the bzr <dig> and bes <dig> protein regulate subsets of br-responsive genes as downstream signalling components  <cit>  and are considered to mediate responses to other stimuli as well. the ethylene-insensitive3-like  transcription factor, which participates in ethylene signalling pathway  <cit> , was also induced at the early stage of nahco <dig> stress treatment.

14-3- <dig> proteins are known to regulate several cellular processes and therefore are called as general regulatory factors   <cit> . we found that grf family genes were up-regulated from  <dig>  to  <dig> h, and decreased after  <dig> h. recent investigation of 14-3- <dig> gene expression profile showed that they are also regulated by salt stress  <cit>  and alkaline stress  <cit> .

micrornas
several stress-specific micrornas have been identified in plants under various abiotic stresses, including nutrient deficiency  <cit> , drought  <cit> , cold  <cit> , high salinity  <cit> , uv-b radiation  <cit>  and mechanical stress  <cit> . some microrna targets are stress-related genes, suggesting that micrornas play important roles in plant stress response  <cit> .

a blastn  <cit>  search against  <dig> pre-micrornas in mirbase   <cit>  identified  <dig> micrornas in the microarray, among which  <dig> were called present and were modulated by nahco <dig> stress. hierarchical clustering using the average expression value of these  <dig> micrornas identified  <dig> distinctive patterns as illustrated in figure  <dig>  mir <dig>  mir1507a, mir1507b and mir156a were reduced after  <dig> h and increased after  <dig> h. mir <dig> targets two cu/zn superoxide dismutases  and was reported to decrease dramatically under oxidative stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . mir156a was increased under salt stress in arabidopsis, and targets  <dig> sbp family transcription factors which play essential role in vegetative phase change and root development  <cit> . mir1507a and mir1507b were known to be involved in nitrogen fixation in soybean nitrogen-fixing nodules  <cit> . similar to the observation in arabidopsis  <cit> , mir167c and mir2108b were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> h. mir166a, mir <dig> and mir2108a form a cluster with distinctive dynamic pattern . mir <dig> has been reported to be salt stress regulated and target to argonaute <dig>  which is related to plant development  <cit> . the stress modulated mirnas suggest their possible roles in alkaline stress.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comprehensive transcriptome profiling analysis of wild soybean root under alkaline stress. the current knowledge about plant alkaline stress response is limited and we provide a list of genes showing dynamic expression change under nahco <dig> stress. functional characterization of these genes highlights the common and distinctive mechanisms underlying plant response to alkaline and other abiotic stress. most of the alkaline-modulated genes are involved in metabolism, energy, signal transduction and transcription. some molecular processes, such as signal transduction, secondary metabolism, and regulation of transcription, were induced at earlier time points. genes involved in these processes accomplished their regulatory mission and decreased after  <dig> h. as a result, protein synthesis and energy metabolism were induced. these data indicate that the cellular pathways respond to the nahco <dig> stress as a cascade process.
