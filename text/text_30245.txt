BACKGROUND
gene targeting is the process by which exogenously delivered dna is used to modify a genomic target by homologous recombination. since in human cells the spontaneous frequency of homologous recombination is on the order of 10- <dig>  the gene targeting approach is not efficient enough to be applied for clinical use  <cit> . however, several reports indicate that sequence-specific nucleases, which induce a site-specific double strand break in the target dna, can increase gene targeting efficiency up to  <dig> -fold  <cit> ; this approach is thus particularly useful for manipulating primary human cells with therapeutic potential  <cit> . although there has been considerable excitement about the potential application of zinc finger nucleases, since these enzymes allow highly specific, targeted genome modification in live cells  <cit> , several reports show the off-target cleavage sites of these nucleases, highlighting the risk of using this approach  <cit> . therefore, the search for new tools to improve the efficiency of gene targeting is still very important. recently, the induction of a site-specific single-strand nick significantly increased gene targeting  <cit> . our previously published studies show that the overexpression or nuclear permeation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein rad <dig> strongly increases homologous recombination and gene targeting in hela cells  <cit> . an alternative method of homologous recombination mediated gene targeting consists of exploiting the recombinogenic nature of the adeno-associated virus  vector genome  <cit> . the aav single stranded  dna genome contains two overlapping open reading frames flanked by two inverted repeated sequences , the only elements required in cis for replication and integration. the rep open reading frame codes for rep proteins essential for dna replication, integration and packaging. the cap codes for the proteins essential for capsid formation  <cit> . vectors based on aav, which deliver single-stranded, linear dna genomes, are able to efficiently introduce many types of mutations into homologous target loci at a frequency approaching 1% in mammalian cells, and are currently used as gene targeting vectors  <cit> . however, using this method, each homologous targeted event occurs within ten random integrations  <cit> . recently, by combining aav technology with zinc finger nucleases, the efficiency of gene targeting increases up to 6% but most integration events still occur outside the target locus, most likely in naturally occurring dna double-strand breaks  <cit> .

moreover, aav-mediated gene targeting has been reported to be less dependent on the extent of homology between the vector and the genome target than other methods  <cit> . notably, the presence of the itrs flanking the gene targeting construct determines increased homologous recombination frequencies  <cit> .

when aav rep proteins are expressed, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to replicate the ssdna genome  <cit> . the proteins rep <dig> and rep <dig> are necessary for aav replication and for site-specific integration  <cit> . rep proteins interact with the rep-binding element and the terminal resolution site sequences located within the itrs, to create a nick that may increase the integration  <cit> .

in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, gene targeting is very efficient; it occurs at a frequency of 2–3% and can be increased up to 25%, whereas random or non-homologous integration is reported to be less than  <dig> %  <cit> . yeast is an excellent genetic model for understanding the mechanisms and pathways involved in homologous and non-homologous recombination  <cit> . moreover, yeast has been recently used as a system for studying the potential of a new genome editing approach for site-specific mutagenic and multiple allele replacement  <cit> .

we decided to use the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to evaluate whether the presence of itrs in the integrating plasmid and the expression of aav rep proteins have an effect on gene targeting and random integration. the aim of this study was to assess whether the use of aav sequences or expression of rep proteins could be a feasible and valuable tool for increasing gene targeting or decreasing random integration.

RESULTS
the presence of itrs decreased the random integration of a gene targeting construct
aav vectors are often used for gene targeting experiments in mammalian cells also in combination with zinc finger technology  <cit> . several studies indicate that aav mediated gene targeting is affected by homologous recombination genes and that the aav integration can be dependent on non-homologous end joining  <cit> ; however, to our knowledge no comparative study has been performed to understand the role of itrs and rep proteins in gene targeting and random integration. thus, to study the effect of itrs on yeast gene targeting, we constructed a novel vector called paavlul, containing the lys <dig> gene interrupted by ura <dig> gene and flanked by the itrs . as shown in figure 1b, the gene targeting fragment from the paavlul was generated by two different restriction enzymes in order to keep the itrs flanking both ends of the fragment, or not.

overall, gene targeting was not affected by the presence of itrs ; however, the random integration increased by almost threefold when itrs were not present . thus, when itrs are present, the gt/ri ratio increased fifty fold because the random integration decreased . southern blot analysis of genomic dna of eleven ura3+lys2+ random integration clones derived from yeast transformed with itrs-carrying fragments indicated that ten clones have a single ura <dig> integration . although the size of the band is higher than the size of the aav construct  , three clones out of ten have no itrs as detected by the hybridization of the blot with itr probe . moreover, three clones have two or more copies of the construct, one detected with ura probe  and two detected with itr probe . clone  <dig> integrated two copies of the dna fragment, but only one copy contained itrs. we considered “rearrangements” those bands which were detected by only one probe  or those with a size smaller than raav . we can conclude that in six out of eleven clones  some rearrangement occurred. in order to better understand whether these rearrangements are due to itrs, we analyzed the genomic dna of fourteen ura3+lys2+ random integration clones derived from the transformation with no itr carrying-fragment. figure  <dig> shows that nine out of fourteen clones  contained a single copy of the fragment  and there was no band lower than  <dig>  kb . to make sure that itrs are really not present in the genomic dna, we hybridized the filter with the itr probe. no bands were detected . this result suggests that no rearrangement has occurred in absence of itrs. finally, we sequenced the junctions in order to see where the gene targeting construct was randomly integrated. by using two primers starting from the two portions of lys <dig> gene in the fragment, we were able to sequence four junctions; three junction sites were located on chromosome ii right next to the lys <dig> locus and one junction was on chromosome xvi. the precise analysis of the sequence did not reveal any preferred junction site. however, it is possible that the homology between the fragment and the genome drives non-homologous integration. our results clearly indicate that the presence of itrs flanking the homologous sequence in the gene targeting fragment decreased random integration in yeast but determined a higher number of rearrangements.

the expression of rep proteins increased aav integration of a non-homologous fragment carrying itrs
as rep <dig> produces a site-specific ssdna nick in the itr, we thought that this ssdna nick could affect both gene targeting and random integration. we used a yeast strain stably expressing all the rep proteins to determine the effect on both gene targeting and random integration of the itrs carrying fragment. the expression of rep proteins is shown in the western blot in figure 4a. when the integration fragment shared homology with the genomic target , both gene targeting and random integration were not affected by the expression of rep proteins . however, when there is no homology between the fragment and the genome locus , the rep expression significantly increased random integration . presumably, the ssdna nick at the level of itr may be repaired through non-homologous recombination, resulting in an increase in random integration of the vector. southern blot analysis of the genomic dna extracted from a total of twelve clones derived from transformation of the yeast strain stably expressing rep proteins was performed to check the number of stably integrated plasmid copies. it is interesting to note that eleven out of twelve clones contained at least two copies of the fragment . this may be important for gene therapy application, where it is preferable to avoid vector random integration in order to prevent rearrangements.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the itrs and rep proteins may affect aav genomic random integration when no homology between the vector and the genome is present, and that rearrangements occur. conversely, the presence of the aav itrs at both ends in a gene targeting construct sharing homology with a genomic locus could have an impact on the application of this strategy by significantly decreasing random integration.
