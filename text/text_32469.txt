BACKGROUND
flowering plant  seeds are chimeric structures which contain tissues whose cells have unequal genomic contributions from the maternal and paternal parents  <cit> . within arabidopsis thaliana seeds the diploid embryo is comprised of cells containing nuclear genomes inherited equally from the maternal and paternal parents. in contrast, the triploid endosperm contains two maternally inherited nuclear genomes and one paternal genome. in addition, these two fertilisation products are surrounded by a maternally derived diploid seed coat  <cit> . the triploid endosperm is a terminally differentiated structure which nourishes the developing embryo, while the diploid maternal seed coat plays key roles in supporting the development of the seed and the embryo it harbours  <cit> . the interactions between these different tissues and genomes during seed development in plants remain poorly understood  <cit> , despite the fundamental economic importance of angiosperm seeds. for any given gene, the relative and absolute contribution of each seed tissue to overall transcript levels in the seed can be difficult to determine.

an important consequence of the unequal contributions of male and female genomes to the chimeric seed is that seed development can be affected by genome dosage and parent-of-origin effects  <cit> . such maternal effects include sporophytic maternal effects from the maternally derived seed coat and gametophytic maternal effects derived from the female gametes. gametophytic maternal effects on seed development can be due  to general dosage effects in the endosperm;  to deposition of maternal transcripts expressed prior to fertilization in the egg and central cell that give rise to the embryo and endosperm, respectively; or  to epigenetic regulation of genes via genomic imprinting, whereby autosomal genes are uniparentally expressed post-fertilisation in a parent-of-origin-specific manner  <cit> .

genomic imprinting has been predominantly described in mammals and flowering plants where it occurs in nutritive tissues  and the developing embryo, although the latter is rare in plants  <cit> . while there are many theories regarding the evolution of genomic imprinting in mammals and plants, some focus on imprinting arising due to a 'parental conflict' over resource allocation  <cit>  or due to a necessity to limit gene dosage of key genes during early development  <cit> .

many imprinted genes  have been identified and intensively studied in mammalian species  <cit> . until recently , only  <dig> imprinted genes had been reported across all flowering plant species,  <dig> of them in arabidopsis thaliana . imprinted genes have been identified using a range of different strategies, including: mutant screens for maternally-controlled seed abortion ; screens for genes regulated by the fis polycomb group complex ; microarray analyses searching for genes showing similar responses to known imprinted genes ; endosperm mrna profiling , and via a combination of microarray profiling and allele-specific expression analysis on endosperm from reciprocally crossed inbred lines . using cdka; <dig> fertilized seeds which lack a paternal genome contribution to the  central cell, shirzadi et al  used microarray profiling to identify agl <dig> as a maternally expressed imprinted gene amongst the  <dig> genes differentially regulated in the absence of a paternal genome  <cit> . the advent of next generation sequencing based transcriptomics has facilitated the recent identification of additional imprinted gene candidates in arabidopsis thaliana seeds  <cit> . hsieh et al   <cit>  identified  <dig> confirmed imprinted genes  in f <dig> hybrid seeds  from ler- <dig> × col- <dig> reciprocal crosses. again using next generation sequencing approaches, wolff et al   <cit>  have identified  <dig> candidate imprinted genes in f <dig> hybrid seeds  from bur- <dig> × col- <dig> reciprocal crosses of which  <dig> were confirmed in both cross directions . hence, 'next generation' sequencing studies are now being employed to identify putative imprinted genes  <cit> .

an indirect approach for the identification of novel imprinted genes has been conducted based on identification of differentially methylated regions  as candidate imprinting control regions   <cit> . genes acting as modifiers of genomic imprinting have also been identified in plants and include met <dig>  <cit> , ddm <dig>  <cit>  and dme  <cit> . for example, the 5-methylcytosine dna glycosylase gene dme is preferentially expressed in the central cell of the female gametophyte and can regulate the expression of some imprinted genes in the endosperm through demethylation of their icrs  <cit> . in mutant dme endosperm icrs remain methylated and as a result some imprinted genes are misregulated, which facilitates their detection  <cit> .

while there are a number of genome-wide profiling approaches that can be used to identify allele-specific expression, there are several significant challenges for the definition of novel imprinted genes  <cit> . to distinguish between allele-specific expression effects that are either parent-of-origin dependent  or independent, it is necessary to demonstrate the parent-of-origin dependency of uniparental expression at imprinted loci by analysis of reciprocal f <dig> hybrid offspring. furthermore, where maternal-specific expression is detected in a plant seed, it is necessary to distinguish between seed coat versus endosperm  expression, and also to distinguish between transcripts maternally deposited in the egg and/or central cell versus transcripts generated post-fertilisation in the developing endosperm and/or embryo  <cit> . while imprinted genes displaying clear mutant phenotypes  on seed development can facilitate interpretation of such loci as imprinted  <cit> , many of the imprinted genes identified to date do not display any obvious mutant phenotype in seeds  <cit> . in some instances, promoter:reporter constructs have been used to identify cis-regulatory regions that are required for imprinting  <cit> , while only one study has demonstrated post-fertilisation nascent uniparental de novo transcription of an imprinted gene in the endosperm  <cit> .

the choice of transcript profiling platform is an important consideration for identification of novel imprinted genes. microarrays are dependent on genes being expressed at a level sufficient to be detectable via hybridization and complementary strategies are necessary to also detect imprinted genes that may be lowly expressed. hence, in this study we chose cdna-aflp  <cit>  for genome-wide screening for novel imprinted genes. although an early generation transcript profiling technology, as a pcr-based technology, cdna-aflp allows the amplification of even lowly expressed transcripts and can identify uniparentally expressed transcripts for all cases where there is a restriction site polymorphism between the parental alleles. to facilitate genome-wide cdna-aflp expression profiling, we have developed a gene-identifying bioinformatic software program, genfrag, which can determine the identity of genes displaying parent-of-origin specific cdna-aflp expression profiles.

our analysis of allele-specific expression of  <dig> transcript-derived fragments  in an experimental design based on the generation of reciprocal f <dig> hybrids seeds allowed the identification of  <dig> genes displaying maternal-specific expression . the maternal specific expression of some of these megs may be due to genomic imprinting. within these  <dig> maternally expressed genes,  <dig> represent genes that display higher relative and absolute expression levels in the endosperm relative to the maternal seed coat. hence, the detection of maternal-specific expression of such genes in f <dig> hybrid seeds  <dig> days after pollination  is consistent with such genes being subject to genomic imprinting in the developing endosperm. four of these  <dig> megs have proximal differentially methylated regions  in seed endosperm from wild-type and dme mutant backgrounds that may represent candidate imprinting control elements . for the three top ranked candidates  we confirm maternal-specific expression in f <dig> hybrid seeds  <dig> dap and characterise the control of their allele-specific expression at different developmental stages, and in different genetic and mutant backgrounds. overall, we have identified a range of novel megs in arabidopsis thaliana seeds, from which we further demonstrate that three are novel maternally expressed imprinted genes in arabidopsis thaliana seeds.

RESULTS
cdna-aflp expression profiling of arabidopsis thaliana siliques containing f <dig> hybrid seeds detects  <dig> uniparentally-expressed tdfs
to identify genes which are uniparentally expressed in f <dig> hybrid seeds within siliques of arabidopsis thaliana we employed a genome-wide cdna-aflp transcriptome profiling approach. at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap, rna samples were generated from siliques containing f <dig> hybrid seeds generated via reciprocal crosses between the accessions col- <dig> and ler- <dig>  these three stages correspond to developmental stages from the late globular  to early and late heart stages  of embryo development within the seed. these stages of embryo development were chosen to mitigate against the possibility of detection of maternally deposited long-lived rnas in the egg cell and/or central cell, and also because zygotic expression from both parental alleles is evident at these developmental stages  <cit> . in these samples, maternally expressed genes may be detected from either the silique or f <dig> seed tissues, and within the f <dig> seeds from either the maternal seed coat or the fertilisation products .

aflp was performed on cdna derived from rna samples following restriction digestion with a frequently cutting enzyme  and a rare cutting enzyme  . fragments were ligated with adapters complementary to the restriction sites of the enzymes. to reduce the complexity of the mixture of fragments, a series of pcr amplifications were performed to generate subsets of fragments using selective primers. these selective primers share a common sequence, which corresponds to the adapters and a section of the restriction sites but are differentiated by one or two additional nucleotides at the 3'end, called selective nucleotides .

the cdna-aflp generated transcript derived fragments  were run on an abi3130xl capillary analyser and visualized with fluorescently labelled probes to accurately estimate their size . a total of  <dig>  tdfs were detected across the three time points . the tdfs ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  and an average of  <dig> bp was visualized per sample. of the  <dig>  tdfs screened,  <dig> showed a polymorphism between cdna derived from the reciprocal crosses between the two different accessions  with sizes ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp. maternally expressed alleles were found in approximately equal numbers when each of the two accessions were used as the maternal parent in a reciprocal cross . for example, at the  <dig> dap time-point,  <dig> maternally expressed col- <dig> alleles were detected in the col- <dig> × ler- <dig> cross, while  <dig> maternally expressed ler- <dig> alleles were detected in the reciprocal ler- <dig> × col- <dig> cross. the numbers of maternally expressed tdfs detected were similar across the three developmental stages indicating consistency of maternal-specific transcription during early silique development. for each polymorphic allele , only one fragment is detectable from each restriction digestion event as only those tdfs proximal to the poly-a tail were isolated for analysis. hence for each of the two accessions there is no redundancy within the number of tdfs detected at each time-point.

to identify uniparentally expressed genes, cdna-aflp profiles for these  <dig> polymorphic tdfs were compared between those obtained from siliques containing reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds  and those obtained from the equivalent cross between plants of the same accession . the samples at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap were used to filter for tdfs which displayed uniparental expression for at least two of the stages sampled. this strategy allowed the identification of  <dig> uniparentally expressed tdfs. all  <dig> of the uniparentally expressed tdfs displayed a maternal-specific expression pattern .

direct identification of genes based on tdf size and the selective nucleotides of each primer combination using the genfrag bioinformatics program
to identify the genes that produced the maternal tdfs detected in arabidopsis thaliana siliques containing f <dig> hybrid seeds , we developed a bioinformatics program called genfrag. genfrag is designed to allow in silico identification of sequences of tdfs produced by cdna-aflp using publicly available cdna and est libraries . using these resources, genfrag is designed to simulate the steps of the cdna-aflp in silico by scanning existing arabidopsis thaliana genome information for dual restriction enzyme cutting sites . given the fragment size  and the selective nucleotides added to the primers used to generate the tdf, genfrag can identify the corresponding sequence of a tdf and thereby the identity of the gene corresponding to the tdf. the genfrag software is developed as open source software and is freely available for use online at: http://www.nem.wur.nl/uk/research/bio/.

genfrag-based identification of  <dig> genes from the set of  <dig> maternally expressed tdfs
genfrag was used to identify genes corresponding to the  <dig> maternal specific tdfs . to increase selectivity, we incorporated an option into genfrag to only return the last matched fragment in a 5'-3' sequence i.e. the fragment closest to the poly-a tail of the mrna. we combined this adaptation with a stringent range of  <dig> bp deviation between the observed size of the tdf when run on the capillary analyser and the size predicted in silico for a candidate sequence. using these conditions, genfrag was able to determine unique sequence  matches for  <dig> of the  <dig> maternally expressed tdfs identified . of the remaining tdfs,  <dig> matched sequences shared by more than one gene and therefore could not be uniquely distinguished , while the remaining  <dig> could not be matched to any genes using the genfrag approach . the lack of identification of these  <dig> tdfs may be due to aberrant enzyme restriction and/or incomplete coverage of the arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome. the  <dig> unique sequence tdfs were matched to genes by blast searching the arabidopsis thaliana genome . this allowed us to unambiguously identify  <dig> maternally expressed genes in arabidopsis thaliana siliques containing f <dig> hybrid seeds . gene ontology enrichment analysis of the  <dig> maternally expressed genes did not reveal any significant enriched terms . our set of  <dig> megs did not include the known imprinted genes from arabidopsis thaliana, however, this is not surprising as most of these  <dig> megs have few snp differences between the alleles from different accessions, and where they do, the snps do not disrupt the restriction sites that are scanned by the cdna-aflp technique using these restriction enzymes . for instance, there are no col-0/ler- <dig> snps in the coding sequence of the maternally expressed imprinted gene medea. the  <dig> genes we identify represent novel maternally expressed genes .

 <dig> maternally-expressed genes were identified from transcript-derived fragments generated by cdna-aflp of hybrid a. thaliana siliques.  <dig> tdfs were identified using genfrag on the basis of their size and the selective nucleotides of the primer combinations used to generate them. these were matched to the  <dig> genes listed by blastn against a. thaliana genome . nine genes which have been reported as preferentially endosperm-enriched  are marked in bold.

 <dig> candidate imprinted genes in which the observed maternal expression is predominantly derived from higher transcript levels in the endosperm relative to the maternal seed coat
the  <dig> maternally expressed genes  were detected in siliques containing reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds where the maternal-specific expression could be derived from the silique, the maternal seed coat, the endosperm and/or the embryo. seed expressed genes which are predominantly maternally expressed in the endosperm from  <dig> dap  are excellent candidates for regulation by genomic imprinting. it was recently shown that embryo development up to the globular stage does not depend on de novo transcription while endosperm development requires active transcription following fertilization, suggesting that maternally deposited rnas do not play a predominant role in the endosperm  <cit> . thus, mrnas detected in the endosperm at ≥  <dig> dap are most likely to be derived from de novo transcription post-fertilization. to identify which of the  <dig> maternally expressed genes are predominantly expressed in the endosperm at high expression levels, we used a publicly available expression dataset  where the relative expression levels of genes in the seed coat and endosperm tissues  of seeds at the globular stage of embryo development  have been assessed.

from the  <dig> maternally expressed genes, we could identify  <dig> genes which had strong signals of expression in the  <dig> dap seed. eleven genes were not detected as they did not have probes in the array dataset used, or their probes also matched another gene. nine genes were not expressed in seeds and therefore may be good candidates for silique specific megs. comparing the expression levels between the endosperm and the seed coat, we found three megs which were exclusively expressed in the seed coat but no megs which were absent from the seed coat but were expressed in the endosperm. however, twenty-nine megs showed expression in both the endosperm and the seed coat. we considered that if maternal-specific expression can be demonstrated in seeds for megs where the majority of the expression level signal is from the endosperm, that such a pattern would be strongly indicative of a maternally expressed imprinted gene in the endosperm. biallelic expression in the endosperm should also be easier to detect in such cases. hence, for these twenty-nine megs, we aimed to identify genes where the majority of the expression detected in the seed is due to the endosperm fraction. we selected the  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> that showed higher expression in the endosperm compared to the seed coat and ranked these genes based on the absolute difference of expression levels between the highest expressing endosperm fraction and the seed coat . we reasoned that genes displaying the highest levels of expression in the endosperm of  <dig> dap seeds were least likely to be genes where maternal-specific transcripts detected could be due to maternal deposition of transcripts in the central cell  <cit>  or transferred from the maternal seed coat as has recently been proposed  <cit>  i.e. we focussed on genes which are highly expressed in the endosperm relative to the maternal seed coat. as a complementary approach, we also compared these genes on the basis of relative transcription levels . for these megs with significantly higher expression levels in the endosperm when compared to the seed coat, maternal-specific expression detected in reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds at  <dig> dap is consistent with regulation via genomic imprinting in the endosperm. using these approaches, we chose the three top ranked genes as measured by total enrichment of expression in the endosperm, atcdc <dig> , pde <dig>  and ms5-like  as our strongest imprinted candidates for further investigation. although pde <dig> and ms5-like were less highly expressed in the endosperm in total, they were also the most highly ranked genes as measured by ratio of endosperm:seed coat expression  and as noted in table  <dig> have previously been reported as preferentially endosperm-expressed in a microarray study performed by day et al.  <cit> . hence we consider all three of these megs to be principally expressed in the f <dig> endosperm relative to the maternal seed coat.

laser capture microdissection  and qrt-pcr confirm expression of atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like in arabidopsis thaliana seed
to validate the expression patterns of the three top ranked imprinted gene candidates atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like, we used laser capture microdissection  to microdissect arabidopsis thaliana seeds  of accession ler- <dig> into endosperm , seed coat  and embryo  fractions. the three lcm tissues were screened by qualitative end-point rt-pcr to investigate tissue-specific expression of each gene within the seed at  <dig> dap, which confirmed that all three genes are indeed expressed in arabidopsis thaliana seeds . transcripts were detected in both the seed coat and endosperm for all three genes, while atcdc <dig> and ms5-like were also detected in the embryo. although this qualitative rt-pcr analysis provided no indication of relative expression levels in each of the three distinct parts of the seed, it served to independently confirm that the three genes are indeed expressed in seed tissues at  <dig> dap in the tissues predicted by the seed gene network expression database .

to determine how the expression levels of these genes in seeds varied over the time-course covered by our cdna-aflp experiment, we performed qrt-pcr on seeds at different time-points  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> days after manual pollination. the existing data for whole-seed expression levels in ws- <dig>  predicted that expression of ms5-like and cdc48a would increase through development . in our qrt-pcr analysis, we found that this expression pattern was conserved in both col- <dig> and ler- <dig> seeds  indicating that for these genes there is little effect of accession background on total expression levels. however, we also found increased expression of pde <dig> at the 5- <dig> dap time-point in both accessions, which differed from the ws- <dig> data  .

to preclude any differences on expression levels that could be due to a hybrid background, we also measured expression of pde <dig> within reciprocal col- <dig> × ler- <dig> crosses at the  <dig>   <dig> and 5- <dig> dap time-points and again found increased expression through seed development . this suggests that the expression patterns of these three seed-expressed genes, which are similar in both parental accessions, are not significantly altered in their f <dig> hybrid offspring, although transcript levels of pde <dig> might be slightly higher at  <dig> dap in the col- <dig> × ler- <dig> cross direction. because expression increases throughout development, and was, in contrast, lower in pre-fertilized ovules , this suggests that the expression we have detected is due to de novo post-fertilisation transcription and not maternal deposition of long-lived rna transcripts from the central cell and/or egg cell to the post-fertilisation endosperm and/or embryo, respectively.

the maternally expressed seed genes atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like are subject to gene-specific imprinting in different genetic backgrounds
genomic imprinting can be 'gene-specific'  or 'allele-specific'   <cit> . to validate the three top-ranked genes as maternally expressed imprinted genes and to test for gene- vs allele-specific imprinting, we identified snps in the coding regions of each gene between the col- <dig> and c <dig> accessions, and between the col- <dig> and bur- <dig> accessions. we sequenced cdna from reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds  to detect any evidence of mono-allelic expression patterns consistent with regulation of the genes by genomic imprinting. to confirm the effects in both of the genetic backgrounds used for cdna-aflp, we also sequenced snps in cdna from f <dig> hybrid seeds  of ler- <dig> × col- <dig> crosses for pde <dig> and ms5-like. in all cases, we found that atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like were maternally expressed in f <dig> hybrid seeds at  <dig> dap . while binary imprinted expression  was observed for atcdc <dig> and pde <dig>  ms5-like displayed preferential expression of the maternally inherited allele . this indicates that the imprinted status of these three genes, like their expression levels , is conserved across divergent accessions and that they likely represent cases of gene-specific imprinting.

as a more general validation of the cdna-aflp approach to detect maternally expressed seed genes, we chose six further genes predicted to be expressed in seed tissues and sequenced snps in cdna generated from col- <dig> × c <dig> and c <dig> × col- <dig> f <dig> hybrid seeds at  <dig> dap. in all six cases, we validated maternal-specific expression. we have therefore validated 9/ <dig> = 17% of the genes identified as uniparentally expressed by cdna-aflp as megs .

for the top ranked imprinted gene atcdc <dig>  we also quantified the extent of imprinting using quantification of allele specific expression by pyrosequencing , a technique based on real-time pyrophosphate  detection  <cit> , which allows precise relative quantification of snp frequencies . quasep was performed on the maternally expressed imprinted gene atcdc <dig> using cdna collected from reciprocal col- <dig> × c <dig> f <dig> hybrid seeds . the known imprinted genes fwa and phe <dig> were used as controls , which confirmed maternal-specific  and paternal-specific  expression patterns for these two imprinted genes, respectively  <cit> . phe <dig>  the non-imprinted endosperm-expressed homologue of phe <dig>  was used as a biallelic control . we found that in f <dig> hybrid seeds at  <dig> dap the relative expression level from the maternally inherited allele of atcdc <dig> was 100%  and  <dig> %  indicating that atcdc <dig> displays maternal-specific expression . although atcdc <dig> is subject to expression in the seed coat, it displays high expression levels in the chalazal endosperm , which is consistent with post-fertilisation transcription in the endosperm rather than a scenario of deposition of maternal transcripts in the central cell. thus, the expression pattern of atcdc <dig> is consistent with atcdc <dig> being a novel maternally expressed imprinted gene in the endosperm of arabidopsis thaliana seeds.


expression of imprinted genes in endosperm of seeds at later developmental stages
in a recent study, hsieh et al.   <cit>  screened for novel imprinted genes in 7- <dig> dap seed from reciprocal crosses between col- <dig> and ler- <dig>  the differences between the numbers of uniparental tdfs identified by cdna-aflp at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dap , with only  <dig> uniparental tdfs detected at multiple developmental stages, suggests some temporal dynamism in the regulation of imprinting in arabidopsis thaliana seeds which could potentially explain the lack of overlap between our results and those of hsieh et al.  <cit> . to test this, we investigated whether the megs we had identified at  <dig> dap remained monoallelic or became biallelic at later developmental stages. our results indicate that in cdna from  <dig> dap seed, paternal alleles were more highly expressed than at  <dig> dap for all three of the genes . in the case of atcdc48a, this rendered the expression fully biallelic, whilst the maternal allele was still preferentially expressed for ms5-like and pde <dig> . at the  <dig> dap time-point, while all three genes are expressed from the embryo and endosperm, the relative and absolute contributions of each tissue to total transcript levels in the  <dig> dap seed are not known. hence, the increased expression of the paternal allele observed in the  <dig> dap seed could arise from loss of imprinting and/or a shift in the relative proportion of embryo versus endosperm tissues amounts in the  <dig> dap seed . in the latter scenario, the meg could remain imprinted in the endosperm tissue, but be masked by a biallelic expression signal from the more abundant embryo tissue at  <dig> dap. the expression of both alleles would be likely to preclude their identification at the p< <dig>  cut-off used for most gene identifications by hsieh et al.  <cit> . we also considered the concordance between our dataset and a further next-generation sequencing screen performed by wolff et al.  <cit>   and found no overlap either with our screen or with that of hsieh et al.  <cit>  . we also found very little overlap  between imprinted genes detected by these two studies and differentially methylated regions  previously predicted by gehring et al.  <cit> . this prompted us to consider the possible existence of unidentified dmrs which could act as imprinting control regions  associated with our imprinted genes.

identification of dmrs at the atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like loci
while the imprinting control regions  of imprinted genes in mammals often overlap with differentially methylated regions , the genome-wide distribution of dmrs means that only some of these are likely to be icrs  <cit> . in plant genomes, icrs that coincide with dmrs have been identified for the imprinted genes fwa  <cit> , phe <dig>  <cit> , and mpc  <cit> . as noted above, however, they have not been detected for many other imprinted genes, and induction of imprinting by many putative dmrs  <cit>  remains unconfirmed . using available methylation data for wild-type and dme endosperm  <cit> , we searched for dmrs in the genomic vicinity of the maternally expressed imprinted loci atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like.

we identified dmrs that could potentially act as icrs for pde <dig> and atcdc <dig>  by analysing expression data derived from endosperm of the wild type and endosperm of seeds deficient for a maternal dme allele  <cit> . these were retrieved from arrayexpress and the percentage of methylation at cytosines situated between the genes immediately upstream and downstream of the gene bodies calculated. a dmr was located  <dig> bp downstream of atcdc48a containing  <dig> cytosines, of which  <dig> are hypermethylated in dme . four dmrs were located upstream of pde <dig> at distances of  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp ,  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  . no obvious dme-dependent dmrs could be identified in the genomic neighbourhood of the imprinted gene ms5-like . we also analysed our entire portfolio of candidate imprinted genes  for potential dmrs in their vicinity. in contrast to our three top ranked imprinted genes, we could only identify dmrs for two additional genes out of the other  <dig>  namely at1g <dig>  and at2g <dig>  . overall, these data suggest that the imprinted ms5-like gene is less likely to be regulated via a methylation-dependent mechanism than the imprinted genes atcdc <dig> and pde <dig> 

expression levels of imprinted genes atcdc <dig> and pde <dig> are regulated by methylation pathways
in order to confirm whether dna methylation changes are associated with altered expression levels of our novel imprinted genes, we performed qrt-pcr on cdna derived from seedlings of met1- <dig> plants and found that there is a significant aberrant induction of the imprinted megs atcdc48a and pde <dig> in met1- <dig> mutants . in concordance with the failure to detect a candidate dmr for ms5-like, no such induction occurred for this gene . interestingly, however, seeds generated by fertilising wild-type arabidopsis thaliana with pollen from met1- <dig> plants did not cause a reactivation of the paternal allele of any of the three genes . the maternal fis-complex has also been recently shown to regulate imprinting of certain megs  <cit> . however, for the three imprinted loci of focus in this study, we found that fertilising fis <dig> plants with wild-type pollen did not lead to any loss of imprinting either . overall, this could imply that the proximal dmrs we have identified do not function as icrs for these imprinted loci. alternatively, it may suggest the existence of a subset of imprinted megs in which imprinted status and expression levels are regulated via a met1- and dme/fis-independent pathway. the lack of response of these three genes to these epigenetic modifier pathways offers a further explanation for the failure of hsieh et al.  <cit>  to detect atcdc48a, ms5-like and pde <dig> as imprinted megs, as their filtering approach compared numbers of sequence reads in wild-type crosses with those crossed to such epigenetic modifier backgrounds.

discussion
in comparison with current knowledge of genomic imprinting  in mammalian genomes, the study of genomic imprinting in plants has been hindered by the low number of imprinted genes that have been reported and studied to date. in this study, we have sought to address this by identifying novel imprinted genes in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and considering our results in the light of screens performed by others, and of current theories concerning the regulation of imprinting in plants.

in this study, we have conducted a genome-wide allele-specific expression analysis screen using cdna-aflp to identify  <dig> maternally expressed tdfs from a total of  <dig> polymorphic allele-specific tdfs. some of these may represent candidate maternally expressed genes regulated by imprinting in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. to identify the genes represented by each tdf, we developed a novel bioinformatics software program called genfrag which can directly identify genes  based only on the size of the tdf and the selective nucleotides of the primers used to generate the tdf. although cdna-aflp is an early generation transcriptomics platform, as a technique it has some distinct advantages over probe hybridisation based approaches such as microarrays. these advantages include:  applicability to any species ,  low cost and reproducibility,  small amounts of rna template needed,  detection of lowly expressed genes and  high specificity to distinguish closely related genes  <cit> . however, one of the most time-consuming steps in the cdna-aflp technique is the excision of tdfs from gels so that the tdf can be sequenced . to increase the throughput of gene identification in cdna-aflp experiments involving species with sequenced and well annotated genomes , we developed the genfrag bioinformatics software program.

there have been previous efforts to develop bioinformatic approaches to improve the efficiency of aflp techniques. the large amount of dna sequence data available for several species has been used for in silico predictions of virtual transcript profiles. tailor-made software, such as aflpinsilico  <cit>  and genest  <cit> , allow high-throughput identification of aflp and cdna-aflp tdfs for arabidopsis thaliana and globodera rostochiensis, respectively. these in silico approaches were also developed to enable experiment simulations, decreasing the time needed for aflp optimisation, and the number of samples which need to be processed  <cit> . the genfrag program developed in this study is designed to facilitate high throughput direct identification of genes from cdna-aflp experiments with fully sequenced well-annotated genomes such as that of arabidopsis thaliana. we have made the genfrag program freely available to the research community at: http://www.nem.wur.nl/uk/research/bio/.

in our study to identify novel imprinted genes in arabidopsis thaliana, we applied the genfrag program to the  <dig> tdfs displaying a maternal-specific expression pattern, and could thereby identify  <dig> maternally expressed genes  in arabidopsis thaliana . by filtering for expression within seeds and enrichment within endosperm tissues, we ranked  <dig> megs on the basis of the absolute difference of their expression levels between the seed coat and the endosperm . the identification of ms5-like and pde <dig> was also supported by alternative approaches i.e. comparison with the dataset of day et al.  and ranking by ratio of endosperm/seed coat expression . for any given gene expressed in the developing seed, it is difficult to separate both the absolute and relative contributions of the different seed tissues, especially given their differing ploidies  and the differences in cellular/nuclear abundance for the different tissues . as the contributions to total transcription are normalised against units of rna no direct determination of the absolute contributions from each seed tissue is possible. however, we can demonstrate that biallelic expression in the seed is detectable at the developmental stage we sample through use of a biallelic endosperm expressed gene  as a positive control . our approach does have the advantage of allowing a focus on highly expressed genes, whose transcripts in seeds  <dig> dap are least likely to have been maternally deposited in the central cell prior to fertilisation. the endosperm is transcriptionally active immediately following fertilization, such that maternally deposited, long-lived rnas are unlikely to play an important role  <cit>  or be found at high levels in endosperm tissues  <dig> dap. this contrasts with the early development of the embryo, where expression in the embryo is maternally-biased , with paternal alleles subsequently becoming reactivated at the later globular stages of embryo development  <cit> . hence, the top ranked endosperm-enriched genes identified in our study can be considered to be the most likely imprinted genes .

a striking finding in our study is that there is little overlap in terms of genes detected between all of the different screens for imprinted genes in arabidopsis thaliana conducted to date, including our study . possible explanations for such lack of overlap can include  use of different accessions ;  use of samples from different developmental stages ;  use of different filtering criteria;  use of different experimental approaches for isolation of seed, embryo and endosperm tissues and rna from each tissue; and  use of different transcriptome profiling platforms and bioinformatic pipelines. in this study we demonstrate that the imprinted genes we have identified are unlikely to be detected at the later developmental stage used by hsieh et al.  <cit> , whilst the lack of overlap between the next-generation sequencing approaches of hsieh et al.  and wolff et al.  <cit>  is likely contributed to the analysis of different time points  and different accessions . there is some overlap  between the rna sequencing approach of  <cit>   and a screen for genes regulated by dmrs in col-gl x ler- <dig> crosses  <cit>  suggesting that dmrs may control gene-specific imprinting for a limited number of loci, and/or that their ability to do so may vary according to different genetic backgrounds. although it seems likely that all these approaches have identified imprinted genes it would seem that detection of imprinted loci  may be dependent upon accessions , developmental stages sampled and experimental methodology. these factors may introduce significant variation between the results of different studies. given the increasing numbers of allele-specific expression effects being detected in plants, it may be opportune for the imprinting research community to develop some common standards for the definition and validation of imprinted genes in flowering plants .

for the top three ranked genes atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like, using lcm, we could independently detect expression of these genes in  <dig> dap seed tissues  . for atcdc <dig> and pde <dig> we also confirmed that expression was low in pre-fertilized ovules but increased during the course of seed development , which is consistent with these genes being subject to post-fertilisation expression in the developing seed . we confirmed that all three of these endosperm-expressed genes are maternally expressed in  <dig> dap reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds from different accessions and hence represent novel cases of gene-specific imprinting in arabidopsis thaliana . while atcdc <dig> and pde <dig> are subject to binary imprinted expression, ms5-like shows a preferential maternal expression pattern of imprinting  <cit> , as some paternal expression is also detected . although the expression levels of ms5-like were similar in col- <dig> and ler- <dig> , and in the pattern determined for ws- <dig> , the extent of imprinting did vary, with the c <dig> and bur- <dig> alleles displaying a greater extent of imprinting when paternally inherited.

icrs of imprinted genes often overlap with dmrs. hence, we considered that our top-ranked imprinted genes atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like might contain candidate dmrs in their genomic vicinity and that, if so, these could be candidate icrs. we could identify dmrs upstream of pde <dig> and one dmr downstream of atcdc <dig> that could potentially act as icrs . however, the difference in methylation between wild-type and dme endosperm did not reveal any dmr for ms5-like . expression of dme in the central cell leads to hypomethylation of the maternal genome. however, the methylation data used  <cit>  represent the global methylation status of both the maternal and paternal genomes of the endosperm. this could explain why no dmr could be identified for ms5-like. control of imprinting at the ms5-like locus may be independent of dna methylation, or be regulated by a dmr far distal to the gene. methylation-independent imprinting has been observed for some imprinted loci in mammals  <cit>  and histone methylation by polycomb group proteins has been shown to regulate several imprinted genes in plants  <cit> . our results indicate that lack of met <dig> in the male gamete has no effect on imprinting of atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like in the developing seed. in contrast, we find that lack of met <dig> leads to overexpression of atcdc <dig> and pde <dig> in vegetative leaf tissues. no effects of lack of met <dig> in vegetative tissues were observed for ms5-like. taking into consideration the recent findings of  <cit>  and previous reports showing that pcg complexes regulate imprinting  <cit> , we also tested for possible effects of the maternal fis-complex on regulation of the three maternally expressed imprinted genes and found that fertilising fis <dig> plants with wild-type pollen did not lead to any loss of imprinting. hence, alternative epigenetic pathways are likely to regulate imprinting of ms5-like. such regulation can neither be ruled out for atcdc <dig> and pde <dig>  further characterization of the imprinted atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like loci will provide opportunities for increasing our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of genomic imprinting in angiosperms.

the maternally expressed imprinted gene, atcdc48a, is a homohexameric aaa atpase chaperone implicated in cell cycle control and cell proliferation. cdc48/p <dig> represents a highly conserved protein which plays a role as an initiation factor for dna replication in many species  <cit>  and has been shown to be essential in a wide range of multicellular and unicellular organisms  <cit> . in plants, the cdc48a protein has been shown to physically interact with the somatic embryogenesis receptor like kinase  <dig>  protein  <cit> . the arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three cdc <dig> loci, atcdc48a , atcdc48b  and atcdc48c . atcdc48a can functionally complement cdc <dig> mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , and loss of the pux <dig> negative regulator of atcdc <dig> leads to accelerated plant growth due to increased cell division and expansion  <cit> . additional studies in arabidopsis thaliana conducted with t-dna knockout lines of atcdc48a have demonstrated that homozygous null seedlings are viable until  <dig> days old but die shortly thereafter. it was also demonstrated that null atcdc48a alleles have a drastically reduced transmission efficiency through the male gametophyte   <cit> .

our results indicate that atcdc48a is maternally expressed and subject to genomic imprinting in the developing seed  . although the imprinting status of the maize homolog of atcdc48a has not yet been determined, it is possible that imprinting of the maize homolog of atcdc48a  could be responsible for the dosage effects on cell-cycle progression observed in endosperm from interploidy crosses of maize  <cit> . while a clear role for atcdc <dig> in the control of dna replication in plant cells has not yet been established, our findings that atcdc <dig> is a maternally expressed imprinted gene in developing endosperm resonates with a role in controlling proliferation as suggested for imprinted genes by the parental conflict theory  <cit> .

less is known from a functional perspective regarding the other two imprinted genes identified in this study. the ms5-like maternally expressed imprinted gene has sequence similarity to male sterile  <dig> , a gene that has been shown to be essential for male meiosis in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . ms5-like also displays sequence similarity with the sulphur deficiency-induced gene atsdi <dig>  <cit> .

the maternally expressed imprinted gene pde <dig> is annotated as a pigment defective embryo  mutant in the seedgenes database  <cit> . the nuclear encoded pde <dig> locus encodes the tic <dig> protein which is a component of the protein import apparatus of the inner envelope of the chloroplast  <cit> . the identification of a maternally expressed imprinted nuclear gene which encodes a protein product targeted to the maternally-inherited chloroplasts could be suggestive of selection for imprinting at nuclear loci where strong control by maternally-inherited alleles of chloroplast function is essential  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have identified  <dig> maternally expressed genes in siliques containing reciprocal f <dig> hybrid seeds. we have developed and employed a novel bioinformatics tool called genfrag to facilitate higher-throughput analysis of cdna-aflp experiments on organisms with well-annotated sequenced genomes. we ranked the  <dig> maternally expressed genes according to their relative expression levels in the endosperm versus seed coat tissues at the globular embryo stage and chose the three top-ranked imprinted candidate genes for further investigation. we confirmed expression of the three candidates in  <dig> dap seeds by lcm rt-pcr and further confirmed maternal-specific expression of the three genes in  <dig> dap f <dig> hybrid seeds generated with different arabidopsis thaliana accessions. taken together, our results indicate that atcdc <dig> is a maternally expressed imprinted gene in the developing arabidopsis thaliana seed, and is likely imprinted in the endosperm and perhaps the embryo. confirmation of imprinted maternal expression was also demonstrated for the other two top-ranked genes pde <dig> and ms5-like. where present, dmrs for each of the three imprinted genes and the  <dig> maternally expressed genes in table  <dig> were identified and posited as putative icrs. however, analysis of the imprinted atcdc <dig>  pde <dig> and ms5-like loci with the candidate modifiers met1- <dig> and fis <dig> indicates that the regulation of imprinting at these three genes is independent of dna methylation and the fis-complex. overall, our study identifies novel maternally expressed genes in arabidopsis thaliana seed and validates three genes  as novel maternally expressed imprinted genes in arabidopsis thaliana seed. further analysis of the genes identified here and by others will accelerate efforts to increase our understanding of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and evolution of imprinted genes in flowering plants.
