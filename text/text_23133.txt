BACKGROUND
schistosomiasis is considered among the most important of the tropical diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality, ranking only behind malaria  <cit> . international efforts are underway to sequence the entire genomes of two of the three major schistosome species, s. mansoni and s. japonicum  <cit> . it is anticipated that an enhanced understanding of the schistosome genome will aid in the control of this disease, including the development of vaccines and new anti-parasite medications  <cit> . up to half of the schistosome genome may be composed of repetitive sequences, including ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons, mobile genetic elements that transpose through an rna intermediate . mobile genetic elements are drivers of genome evolution  <cit> . in addition to this role, from a practical perspective mobile genetic elements offer potential as transgenesis vectors  <cit> . problematically, however, their interspersed, repetitive nature can impede progress during genome sequencing using shotgun sequencing approaches through the confounding effects of their repetitions on sequence assembly algorithms  <cit> . for these and other reasons, we and others have been characterizing the retrotransposons of the schistosome genome  <cit> . here we report a novel non-ltr retrotransposon termed sr <dig>  a member of the rte clade of non-ltr retrotransposons, from the genome of s. mansoni. based on the multi-copy, interspersed nature of sr <dig>  and the presence of other rte elements characterized previously from the genomes of schistosomes, it appears that members of the rte clade may be the most common and successful of the non-ltr retrotransposons to have colonized the genomes of these metazoan parasites.

RESULTS
new retrotransposons identified in bacterial artificial chromosome 49_j_ <dig> from the genome of s. mansoni
blastn searches revealed the presence of reverse transcriptase -encoding sequences in the s. mansoni bacterial artificial chromosome  number 49_j_ <dig>  <cit> , the entire sequence of which has been deposited in genbank with accession number ac <dig> by el sayed and co-workers  <cit> . annotation provided with genbank ac <dig> indicated that the sequence included in bac 49_j_ <dig> is from chromosome  <dig> of the genome of s. mansoni. inspection of the nucleotide sequence of bac 49_j_ <dig>  of ~ <dig> kb in length, indicated the presence of a number of discrete retrotransposons. one of these encodes a novel long terminal repeat  retrotransposon, which we have described in a recent report  <cit>  . in addition, at least three non-ltr retrotransposons appeared to be located in bac 49_j_ <dig>  one of these appeared to be a degenerate copy of an sr <dig> element. sr <dig> elements are non-ltr retrotransposons of the rte clade  <cit>  which are present in high copy  in the genome of s. mansoni  <cit> . this fragment of sr <dig> was located between nucleotide residues numbers  <dig>  and  <dig>  of bac 49_j_ <dig> and, more specifically appeared to be located within intron number  <dig> of the gene encoding cytosolic zn/cu superoxide dismutase  <cit> . as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the cu/zn superoxide dismutase gene is present in bac 49_j_ <dig> between residues  <dig>  and  <dig>  of bac 49_j_ <dig>  the copy of sr <dig> in the intron of the cu/zn superoxide dismutase gene is ~ <dig>  nucleotides  in length, and included regions encoding the retrotransposon rt domain . over the putative rt-encoding region, the sequence was 47% identical to the rt sequence of sr <dig>  at only ~ <dig>  kb in length, and since full-length copies of sr <dig> are ~ <dig> . kb in length  <cit> , this appears to be a truncated copy of sr <dig> that is unlikely to be autonomously mobile. in like fashion to the location of this truncated copy of sr <dig>  copies of other sr <dig> elements  have been identified previously in introns of other s. mansoni protein encoding genes  <cit> .

sr <dig> represents a new family of non-ltr retrotransposon from the genome of s. mansoni
in addition to the fugitive ltr retrotransposon  <cit> , and the truncated copy of sr <dig>  at least two other retrotransposons were readily identifiable in bac 49_j_ <dig>  the first of these was located between nt  <dig> and  <dig>  , and the second between nt  <dig>  and  <dig>  . comparison of the sequences of these two prospective retrotransposons revealed that they were closely related to one another and appeared to represent discrete copies of a novel family of retrotransposons. we have termed the new retrotransposon sr <dig>  whose phylogenetic analysis indicated a new family of the rte clade of non-ltr retrotransposons . .  for convenience of description, we refer here to the copy of sr <dig> resident between nt  <dig> and  <dig>  of bac 49_j_ <dig> as sr3-left and the other copy between nt  <dig>  and  <dig>  as sr3-right, because they are located on the left and right sides of the bac as in figure  <dig>  the full-length sr3-left and sr3-right elements were comprised of a single, read through open reading frame  encoding two functional domains similar to apurinic-apyrimidic  endonuclease  and rt, in that order. the element terminated with a short repeat sequence,  <dig> or  <dig> . the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the sr3-left and sr3-right copies are provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

the sequence of  <dig>  bp long sr3-right element translated into a single, deduced open reading frame  of  <dig> amino acid residues that did not include any apparent frameshift or stop codon mutations . by contrast, the deduced orf of sr3-left was interrupted by stop codons at amino acid positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the orf . sr3-right has a longer terminal repeat unit than sr3-left,  <dig> compared with  <dig>  which accounts for the difference in total lengths of the two copies .  and the sjr <dig> retrotransposon  of s. japonicum, with the deduced orfs of both sr3-left and sr3-right revealed that the similarity extends well beyond the predicted orf of  <dig> deduced amino acids of sr3-right . whereas this suggests the possibility of premature stop codon in the sr <dig> copies presented here, it may also simply reflect phylogenetic relatedness in the carboxy-terminal encoding regions and 3'utrs of these elements.) nonetheless, sr3-left and sr3-right are very similar to each other in sequence, with the orfs region exhibiting  <dig> % identity and  <dig> % similarity over the predicted orf of  <dig> residues . together, these findings suggest that both sr3-left and sr3-right are full-length copies and, moreover, that sr3-right is an intact, putatively functional and active copy, capable of autonomous retrotransposition activity. it was remarkable not only that two copies  of this retrotransposon reside in close proximity to each other in the region of the s. mansoni genome represented by bac 49_j_ <dig>  but also that both copies are full-length and intact or close to intact. most copies of non-ltr retrotransposons are 5'-truncated, due to deficits in their elongation processes, and generally include deletions or insertions , and are thereby rendered inactive  <cit> .

four other non-ltr retrotransposons have been reported from the genome of s. mansoni. these are sr <dig> and perere, discrete members of the cr <dig> clade, and sr <dig> and perere- <dig>  members of the rte- <dig> clade  <cit> . sr <dig> was dissimilar to these non-ltr retrotransposons reported previously from the genome of s. mansoni: when compared with the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf of sr <dig>  sr <dig> shared  <dig> %/  <dig> % amino acid sequence identity/similarity with sr <dig>  perere shared  <dig> %/ <dig> % identity/similarity, sr <dig> shared  <dig> %/ <dig> % identity/similarity and perere- <dig> shared  <dig> %/ <dig> % amino acid sequence identity/similarity with sr <dig> . together, these differences indicated that sr <dig> was a novel element distinct from these other schistosome non-ltr retrotransposons.

sr <dig> represents a new member of a family of the rte- <dig> non-ltr retrotransposons
the predicted rt domain of sr <dig> was aligned with orthologous domains of numerous other non-ltr retrotransposons including representatives from  <dig> clades of non-ltr retrotransposons, as defined by eickbush and colleagues  <cit> . phylogenetic comparison of the rt domains of these diverse elements revealed that the closest relatives of sr <dig> were shr <dig> from s. haematobium and perere- <dig> from s. mansoni, with close identity also to ac <dig> element from branchiostoma floridae, sr <dig> from s. mansoni, sjr <dig> from s. japonicum and also to rte- <dig> from caenorhabditis elegans , placing sr <dig> in the rte- <dig> clade of non-ltr retrotransposons. in like fashion, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the en domain of eight clades of non-ltr retrotransposons. the topography of the en tree, and the position of sr <dig> within the rte clade, was similar to the topography represented on the rt-based tree, confirming both the inclusion of sr <dig> as an rte clade element and that sr <dig> and sr <dig> were discrete families of rte-like retrotransposons . indeed, in the en tree, sr <dig> was more closely related to rte- <dig> of c. elegans than to sr <dig> of s. mansoni .

structure of sr3
youngman et al.  <cit>  provided the first report of a rte retrotransposon, from the genome of c. elegans. rte clade elements display a broad host range, having been described from numerous invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, and from algae and flowering plants  <cit> . rte- <dig> encodes a  <dig> -amino-acid orf containing both apurinic-apyrimidic endonuclease and reverse-transcriptase domains. a possible first orf of only  <dig> amino acids overlaps with the larger orf and may be the site of translation initiation. members of the rte clade are characterized by unusually short 3' untranslated regions that are predominantly composed of at-rich trimer, tetramer, and/or pentamer repeats  <cit> . rte-derived sine elements are also found in mollusc and flatworm genomes.

in addition to the demonstration by phylogenetic analyses targeting both the rt and en domains that sr <dig> is an rte like element, we compared the structural motifs and domains of sr <dig> with rte- <dig> of c. elegans and sr <dig> of s. mansoni in order to confirm the identity of sr <dig> as an rte clade non-ltr retrotransposon. first, the three elements were of generally similar length;  <dig>  bp for rte- <dig> of c. elegans  <cit> ,  <dig>  bp for sr <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig>  kb for sr3-right. second, the length of the orf was somewhat similar;  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> amino acids for rte- <dig>  sr <dig>  and sr <dig> respectively. the rte- <dig> and sr <dig> elements may also contain a short orf upstream of the major orf, although this has not been confirmed by functional analysis  <cit> . third, the 3'-utrs of rte clade elements are usually short in length and terminate in several tetrameric or pentameric, a-rich repeats. sr <dig> conformed to rte- <dig> in this regard, with sr <dig> exhibiting a short 3'-utr of  <dig> bp in length and terminating with several copies of the tetramer, taag .

a schematic comparison of the structures of rte- <dig>  sr <dig>  sr <dig>  cr <dig>  and an sr1-like element, perere- <dig>  <cit> , is presented in figure  <dig>  in summary, the sr <dig> elements of s. mansoni conform in all respects to the generalized structure of the rte clade of non-ltr retrotransposons. moreover, as with other rte elements, sine-like elements reported from schistosomes may be derived from sr3-like elements  <cit> .

sr <dig> is present in genomes of other schistosome species
investigation of sr <dig> sequences in the genomes of other human schistosomes by blast search analysis revealed many sequences similar to sr <dig> in the transcriptomes of s. japonicum . in addition, when the nucleotide sequence of sr3-right was employed as the query in blastx analysis against the genbank non-redundant database, sr3-like sequences were identified within introns  <dig> and  <dig> of the gene encoding s. haematobium acetylcholinesterase    <cit> . the two copies are similar in sequence , both copies are 5' truncated, and both include regions encoding the rt domain of the retrotransposon . the fragment within intron  <dig> was located between nt  <dig> – <dig> , and the fragment in intron  <dig> was located between nt  <dig> – <dig> . the predicted rt domain of the sr <dig> like element from s. haematobium  was included in the phylogenetic tree presented in fig.  <dig> and was found to be phylogenetically similar to sr <dig> from s. mansoni. the presence of sr <dig> elements in other schistosome species can be explained by vertical transmission from a progenitor schistosome species  <cit> , given that vertical transmission is the expected route of transmission of non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> .

numerous copies of sr <dig> are interspersed throughout the genome of s. mansoni
southern hybridization analysis revealed that multiple bands of digested genomic dna of s. mansoni hybridized to the sr <dig> specific probe, indicating the presence of numerous copies of sr <dig> in the s. mansoni genome . hybridization to the gdna fragments released by double enzyme digestions revealed an even more smeared pattern , clearly suggesting that sr <dig> elements have interspersed throughout the genome of s. mansoni. in addition, a bioinformatics analysis using the approach of copeland et al.  <cit>  was used to estimate copy number of sr <dig> by comparisons with reference copy number estimates of other mobile genetic elements and genes reported previously. blastn searches were undertaken using the nucleotide sequences of these reference genes and the complete nucleotide sequence of sr3-right. because the construction of the s. mansoni bac library  involved partial digestion of the genomic dna with hind iii  <cit> , genes without hind iii sites will be underrepresented in the bac end sequences. accordingly, since sequenced bac ends from this library constitute a large proportion of the genomic s. mansoni sequences in the public domain, we used only genes containing hind iii sites as reference sequences. as shown in table  <dig>  the number of hits for sr <dig>   <dig>  was higher than the number of hits for the single-copy cathepsin d gene  and for three high copy number retrotransposons boudicca , sr <dig> , and sr <dig>  but lower than that for the multiple-copy 28s ribosomal rna gene  . although it is difficult with these available data to obtain a good estimate of the number of copies, however a comparison with the other  <dig> retrotransposons would give a tentative copy number for sr <dig> of between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

sr <dig> is transcribed in all developmental stages of s. mansoni
the nucleotide sequences of the full length of sr3-left and sr3-right elements were employed as query sequences for blast searches of the genbank est database of s. mansoni sequences. the database includes more than  <dig>  est sequences from six developmental stages of s. mansoni – egg, miracidium, cercaria, germball , schistosomulum, and mixed sex adults  <cit> . significant hits were found to ests from all six of these stages . representative accession numbers of the positive matches are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  along with brief details of the regions where the matches were located and statistical significance of the matches. in brief, positive ests spanning all of the 5'utr, 3'utr, en and rt were located in most of these developmental stages. based on these findings, it appeared that sr <dig> was expressed in developmental stages throughout the life cycle of s. mansoni.

sr <dig> integration sites
in order to investigate the nature of integration sites or target sequences of the new retrotransposon within the schistosome genome, five kilobases of nucleotide sequences flanking the 5'- and 3'-utrs of both sr3-left and sr3-right were employed as queries to search the genbank non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases, and the gss and est entries for s. mansoni. these searches revealed no significant matches to any sequences encoding genes of schistosoma species . however, they did reveal that sr <dig> elements appear to target at-rich sites, as indicated in figure  <dig>  a similar preference to l <dig> retrotransposons within the human genome  <cit> . more specifically, the average at content of the integration sites of the  <dig> copies of sr <dig> shown in figure  <dig> was  <dig> % at. whereas target site specificity does not appear to be stringent for sr <dig>  it can be expected to reflect the recognition sequence of the sr <dig> endonuclease. for example, l <dig> elements apparently integrate at numerous sites in the genome because the endonuclease of l <dig> preferably cleaves dna at the short consensus sequence, 5'-tttt/a-3', where/designates the cleavage site  <cit> .

to propagate, non-ltr retrotransposons employ their en and rt enzymes respectively to nick a genomic target site and reverse transcribe the retrotransposon, integrating the element into a new genomic locus  <cit> . this process is termed target-site-primed reverse transcription. for the l <dig> elements in the human genome, a new l <dig> insertion is usually flanked by short direct repeats derived from the target dna locus upon l <dig> integration  <cit> . these repeats are called target site duplications , and can range from several to several hundred nucleotides in length  <cit> . interestingly, both sr3-left and sr3-right are flanked by tsds of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively; tagtggctaatct for sr3-right and cgctcttaaa for sr3-left . the presence of these tsds provides further indication, along with their intact structure, of recent activity of these two copies of sr <dig> localized in bac 49_j_ <dig> . apparently unlike sr <dig>  and certainly unlike l <dig>  some other clades of non-ltr retrotransposons exhibit extreme target site specificity, the well-known examples being the r <dig> and r <dig> elements which are found exclusively in the ribosomal rna genes of insects  and nematodes  or in simple repeats   <cit> .

nonetheless, as noted above, we have detected the presence of sr <dig> of s. haematobium within introns of the ache gene  <cit> , and in addition, other rte elements have been reported from gene-rich sites of the schistosome genome. the degenerate copy of a non-ltr retrotransposon, sr <dig>  <cit>  in bac clone bac 49_j_ <dig> has integrated into intron  <dig> of the zn-cu superoxide dismutase  gene of s. mansoni . sr <dig> from schistosomes has been recorded from several other target genes including  <dig> kda glutathione s transferase  <cit> , cathepsin d  <cit>  and the utr of heat shock protein  <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the rte- <dig> retrotransposon of c. elegans was found inserted in the intron of pim related kinase- <dig>  gene  <cit> . thus, although sr <dig> and other rte clade retrotransposons do not exhibit tight target site specificity, they seem to prefer to integrate into at-rich sites and, in addition, are frequently found in introns and other-non coding areas of protein encoding gene loci.

CONCLUSIONS
a new non-ltr retrotransposon, sr <dig>  is reported from the genome of the human blood fluke schistosoma mansoni. numerous copies of sr <dig> are interspersed throughout the s. mansoni genome, and given the apparently intact sequence of the sr3-right copy of sr <dig> located in bac 49_j_ <dig> and the presence of transcripts from at least six developmental stages of s. mansoni, sr <dig> appears to be an active or recently active retrotransposon. this element is also present in the related human schistosomes, s. haematobium and s. japonicum. based on phylogenetic comparisons of both the reverse transcriptase and endonuclease domains, sr <dig> represents a distinct family of rte elements, discrete from the sr <dig> family described previously from schistosomes  <cit> . while there are numerous non-ltr retrotransposons in the schistosome genome, most elements so far described belong either to the rte clade or cr <dig> clades  <cit> , both of which are considered to be more advanced clades of non-ltr retrotransposons with progressive features including lack of target site specificity and an orf encoding endonuclease and reverse transcriptase, respectively  <cit> . the presence of these and the apparent absence of some other clades of non-ltr retrotransposons should be informative in understanding the influence of mobile genetic elements in shaping the schistosome genome and its evolution and in studies of the phylogeny of schistosomes and related taxa. finally, for studies with transgenesis of schistosomes, it may be possible to adapt an active copy of sr <dig> – such as sr3-right – for the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome genome in similar fashion to the adaptation of l <dig> elements of humans for studies on the movement of line elements in cultured human cell lines  <cit> .
