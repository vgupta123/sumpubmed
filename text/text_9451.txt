BACKGROUND
rice is both a food crop and a model system for scientific research. while the wild plant arabidopsis has become the paramount model plant system, the spectrum of its traits cannot address fundamental questions of crop plant domestication and performance, therefore, an efficient experimental system based on a crop plant is needed. at the time of this publication, rice is the only crop for which complete genome sequence has been made available  <cit> . to realize the full potential of rice genomics, however, an appropriate genomic toolbox must be assembled. while methods such as expression profiling, proteomic and metabolomic analysis can provide insight into the function of genes and pathways, a complete analysis of function must involve disruption or modification of gene action.

several approaches are available for the functional inactivation of rice genes. tagging has been achieved with endogenous  <cit>  and introduced transposons  <cit> , and with the t-dna of agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> . the growing tagged gene databases will provide knock-outs for a majority of rice genes  <cit> , but a substantial number will be missed. such an outcome is exemplified by the tagging resources available in arabidopsis  <cit> , where even  <dig>  tags leave more than 10% of the genes untagged  <cit> . while the probability of tagging a gene increases with the number of available tags, it does so asymptotically and with some sequence bias  <cit> , and the efforts to extend the database produce diminishing returns.

another method exploits rna interference  <cit> , triggered by expression of transgenic hairpin repeats homologous to the gene target. the efficacy of this approach, however, can vary  <cit>  and transgenic technologies may hinder field-testing because of regulatory and containment considerations. given these limitations, the ability to use traditional mutagenesis techniques coupled to efficient targeting of genes would be advantageous. fast neutron mutagenesis can generate small to medium size deletions in genomes. li and colleagues exploited this strategy in rice to develop a pcr-based method that identified smaller-than-expected amplicons due to the presence of a deletion  <cit> . while this approach is potentially quite powerful, the mutants were rare and it is unclear if large populations with a sufficient density of medium sized deletions can be generated to make the process efficient. further, deletions will most likely lead to a complete loss of gene function, making them unsuitable for studying the functions of essential genes.

chemical mutagens have been used for forward genetic screens in a variety of organisms . compounds such as ems and mnu induce single nucleotide changes by alkylation of specific nucleotides  <cit> , resulting in mutations that are high in density and essentially randomly distributed  <cit> . therefore, a relatively small population of individuals can provide an allelic series that includes a variety of missense changes with differing effects on protein function, and nonsense or splice site changes that cause truncation of the gene product. tilling   <cit>  is a general reverse genetic technique that uses traditional chemical mutagenesis methods to create libraries of mutagenized individuals that are later subjected to high throughput screens for the discovery of mutations  <cit> . mutations are identified by enzymatic cleavage of pcr amplified heteroduplexed dna followed by band visualization using fluorescent end-labeling and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the generality of the mutagenesis and the mutation discovery methods allow application of this approach to most organisms. indeed, tilling results have been reported for a variety of plants and animals  <cit> . the application of tilling to rice, however, has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining a population with a sufficiently high mutation density  <cit> . here we describe progress in the tilling of rice. two different mutagenic treatments were used to generate two pilot scale mutant libraries, which were screened for mutations in  <dig> gene targets. a total of  <dig> nucleotide changes were identified. based on this work, we conclude that a sufficient density of mutations can be obtained and detected by this method to create an efficient, large-scale mutation discovery service for rice.

RESULTS
tilling population development
to till rice, we chose a seed mutagenesis strategy analogous to what was used for tilling arabidopsis  <cit> . in this strategy, seeds are soaked with mutagen, and each fertile seedling defines a line harboring unique mutations . to avoid mosaicism in the m <dig> generation, plants are self fertilized and m2s are grown. only one m <dig> individual from each m <dig> is selected for dna extraction. this avoids sampling the same mutation in tilling screens. mutagenesis was performed using protocols that were previously established for grasses  <cit> . while ems has been the mutagen of choice for many tilling projects  <cit> , a relatively low number of ems-induced mutations were reported for the indica rice variety ir <dig> when treated with  <dig> % and 1% ems  <cit>  and initial ems treatments of the reference japonica variety nipponbare resulted in insufficient seed germination due to toxicity . we therefore decided to test if alternative mutagens might provide a higher density of mutations with less toxicity to the treated seeds. a mutagenesis protocol using a combination of sodium azide plus methyl nitrosourea  was selected. this mutagen has been previously used for forward genetic screens of barley  <cit> . a previously developed population in the japonica variety m- <dig> using  <dig> mm az- <dig>  mm mnu  was examined and shown to have a low mutation density . preliminary tests indicated that concentrations of mnu above  <dig> mm caused a large drop in germination and in viability of germinated plants . based on this, a combination of  <dig> mm az- <dig> mm mnu was chosen for mutagenesis of nipponbare. in addition, extended washing of seeds treated with ems enabled the development of a nipponbare population mutagenized with  <dig> % ems.

detection of mutations
for tilling, we designed gene-specific primers that target selected regions of the rice genome . forward-strand primers were end-labeled with irdye  <dig> dye and reverse-strand primers with irdye  <dig> dye. we followed the standard high throughput tilling protocol for mutation discovery  <cit> . after pcr amplification, products were denatured and annealed to form heteroduplexes between complementary strands. heteroduplexes were then cleaved using a crude celery juice extract  <cit> , and the products were size-fractionated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels using a li-cor dna analyzer. cleaved heteroduplexes produced two smaller molecular weight products, one labeled with irdye  <dig> and the other with irdye  <dig>  whose sizes added up to the size of the full length product .

for both the az-mnu and the ems populations,  <dig> unique individual samples were selected for screening. we have previously reported robust discovery of mutations using pooled dnas from eight individuals  <cit> . we therefore chose to pool samples eightfold for rice tilling. prior to pooling, genomic dnas were normalized to a standard concentration. to shorten the time for validation of putative mutations, we used a two-dimensional arraying strategy whereby every individual is represented in two distinct eightfold pools and  <dig> unique individuals are screened in  <dig> lanes . a mutation will then produce signals in two gel lanes, whose positions allow deconvolution of the pools and provide the identity of the individual harboring the mutation . after discovery on a tilling gel, the identity of each change was determined by sequencing.

a total of  <dig> nucleotide changes were identified in the az-mnu and ems populations . we obtained multiple mutations from each target. the mutations in osdreb provide an example of an interesting allelic series that is anchored by a predicted severe loss of function  and contains six other missense changes . to estimate the density of mutations for each population, we divided the total number of mutations identified by the total base pairs screened. we previously reported a diminished ability to detect mutations in the terminal  <dig> base pairs of each end of the amplicon  <cit> . therefore, we subtracted  <dig> base pairs from the size of each amplicon to obtain the effective screening window size. to determine the total number of base pairs screened, we added the adjusted size of each amplicon and multiplied by the total number of samples screened. for each population,  <dig> , <dig> base pairs were interrogated for mutations . we estimate a density of ~ <dig> mutation/ <dig> kb for the  <dig> % ems population and 1/ <dig> kb for the population treated with az-mnu. these mutation densities are ~threefold higher than have been previously observed for treatments with a lower concentration of mutagen  <cit>  .

we compared the mutational spectrum obtained through tilling with the spectrum of natural polymorphisms identified by in silico comparison of sequences from japonica and indica varieties  <cit>  . in the case of chemically-induced mutations, frequent transition changes are expected because both ems and mnu alkylate predominantly g residues and result in gc->at changes  <cit> . comparison of observed to expected ratios of gc->at changes to all other changes indicated that these changes did not result from sampling natural variation  as would be expected if the changes we observed had resulted from contamination. we conclude that most or all changes were induced through mutagenesis.

discussion
there are two critical steps in tilling: mutagenesis and high throughput mutation discovery. for a successful reverse genetics service, it is paramount to achieve a satisfactory mutation density. the experience of the seattle tilling project is that a library of mutagenized individuals is optimally suited for tilling when in average at least one mutation is found per li-cor gel run. with samples pooled eightfold in a two dimensional array and an amplicon size of  <dig>  kb, efficient tilling requires a population with a mutation density of ≥  <dig> mutation/ <dig> kb. mutation rates should increase with increasing mutagen concentration, but developing a well-mutagenized population can be challenging because diverse species and even varieties of the same species display a different response to mutagenic treatments  <cit> . for example, doses of mutagen that result in high lethality of the treated seed in one species, such as barley  <cit> , may not yield the high mutation density that is seen with much less lethality in another species, such as arabidopsis  <cit>  or wheat  <cit> . we experienced such a difficulty with rice, where multiple attempts resulted in unsatisfactorily low mutation densities . although desirable, estimating the mutation rate from phenotypic analysis of m <dig> individuals is not simple. in arabidopsis it is possible to reliably score embryo lethals, a phenotype resulting from deficiency at any of hundreds of genes. this measure has been incorporated in routine mutagenesis for tilling  <cit> . embryo lethality, however, is not as easily ascertained in rice and there is uncertainty on what other phenotypic indicators should be used. for example, the frequency of albino mutants is surprisingly high  in rice populations that had a suboptimal mutation rate as determined by tilling  <cit> . through optimization of mutagenesis treatments and by choosing the highest mutagen concentration compatible with acceptable seed survival, we have succeeded in achieving a satisfactory mutation rate. nipponbare populations treated either with  <dig>  % ems or by sequential soaking in  <dig> mm sodium azide and  <dig> mm mnu, showed a similar density of putative mutations detected by tilling, ~1/ <dig> kb. this mutation density is well suited to high-throughput mutation discovery. comparison of phenotypic versus molecular mutation rates in these populations should provide phenotypic markers for assessing future tilling populations.

the spectrum of observed changes differs from what was observed in arabidopsis, maize, and wheat  <cit> . in these systems, ems-induced changes were mostly gc->at transitions, as expected from the frequent alkylation by ems of guanine residues  <cit> . in our ems-treated rice population, we found 70% gc->at, 11% at->gc, 4% gc->ta, and 15% at->ta. this is not very different from the spectrum of mutations observed in a forward screen in drosophila, which were respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> %   <cit> , and is consistent with the mutational spectrum reported by tilling of barley  <cit> . rice, therefore, might differ from arabidopsis, maize, and wheat in its mutagenic response to ems. there is less information on changes induced in plants by sodium azide and mnu, and no information on the combined action of the two mutagens. both transitions  and transversions were observed after sodium azide treatment in barley  <cit> . mnu induced predominantly gc->at transitions in bacteria  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . the analysis of the changes induced by both the ems and az-mnu treatment argued against the hypothesis that natural polymorphisms introduced by contamination of the nipponbare population could be responsible for the observations. it is possible, nonetheless, that polymorphisms introduced through pollen or seed contamination might be responsible for a minority of the observed changes. this is the case in the arabidopsis population used successfully by the seattle tilling project where rare contaminants have been observed to introduce polymorphisms in multiple genes in the same individual  <cit> . in such cases, however, occasional concurrent mutations found either in the same gene of the same individual, or in other genes of the same individual are expected  <cit> . for example, based on the poisson distribution, the probability of obtaining two mutations in the same individual of either ems- or az-mnu-treated populations after screening  <dig> genes ×  <dig>  bp of dna is  <dig> . an increasing number of concurrent mutations are of course less and less likely to be caused by the mutagenic treatment. once an appropriate p-value threshold is crossed, usually requiring the screening of two or three dozen genes, these rare contaminants can be flagged and eliminated from subsequent tilling searches. in the case of these populations, even if we assume conservatively that all concurrent or non-gc->at changes are due to contamination, and remove them from the counts, the resulting mutation rates  are still satisfactory and suitable for high throughput tilling. a tilling service for the rice community is planned and will be accessible at the following url: .

CONCLUSIONS
we have applied the tilling method to the model crop rice and have identified two different mutagenic treatments that provide a suitably high density of mutations  to consider developing rice for a high throughput tilling service. from this pilot-scale experiment with  <dig> target genes, we were able to identify  <dig> nucleotide changes, most of which were inferred to be induced by mutagen treatment. one nonsense mutation and  <dig> missense mutations were identified, six of which are predicted to be damaging to protein function. the estimated mutation density is at least twofold greater than previously reported for rice and comparable to that reported for arabidopsis.
