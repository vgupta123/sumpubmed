BACKGROUND
brassica napus  is cultivated all over the world for the production of vegetable oil, animal feed and biodiesel. at present, developing high-yielding cultivars is one of the most important tasks of rapeseed breeders. yield of rapeseed is determined by three components: silique number , seed number per silique  and thousand seed weight   <cit> . sn and sps determine the total number of seeds per plant. path analysis identified that tsw has the greatest effect on seed yield, followed by the number of pods per plant  <cit> . sps and tsw are influenced by silique length , seed density , silique breadth , silique thickness  and silique volume . silique related traits showed significant relationships between each other, such as sl has a significant positive relationship with sps  <cit> . therefore, improving seed yield through coordination between these traits is an important breeding goal.

the silique traits are all complex quantitative traits controlled by polygenes and highly influenced by environmental conditions. application of molecular markers for qtl mapping has proved to be a powerful genetic approach to dissect quantitative traits. in recent years, qtl analysis of silique traits, such as sl, tsw, sps and sd has been carried out using different populations in b. napus . more recently, a major qtl on chromosome a <dig> simultaneously affects tsw and sl in b. napus was isolated by fine mapping and association analysis  <cit> . li et al.  report the cloning and characterization of bnac <dig> smg7b on c <dig>  a major qtl that controls sps in b. napus  <cit> . in addition, sb, st and sv are also important silique characteristics for seed yield. adamskia et al.  found that seed size correlated with oil and protein contents, and large seeds normally have better adaptability during germination  <cit> . larger values of sl, sb and st lead to larger sv, and this may lead to larger seed size and stronger photosynthesis. however, there has been little research concerning sb, st and sv so far.

several consensus maps have been constructed by integrating different linkage maps based on common molecular markers , and qtl hotspots for many agronomic traits in b. napus have been identified, including flowering time  <cit> , seed yield  <cit> , oil content  <cit> , heterosis-related traits  <cit>  and plant height  <cit> . zhou et al.  carried out in silico mapping to integrate  <dig> qtls, which increased the density of targeted qtl-linked markers and validated the stable existence of qtls across different populations  <cit> . comparison of qtl position and validation of conserved qtls through map integration is of great significance for breeders to utilize qtls effectively.

although qtls for silique traits have been identified , the candidate genes related to these qtls have not been fully elucidated. comparative mapping among related species is a powerful tool for genetic studies of transferring genomic information from the well-studied species to those more genetically complicated  <cit> . nowadays, much effort focused on comparative analysis between brassica and arabidopsis. for example, raman et al.  conduct a genome-wide association study for flowering time in b. napus and identify seven single nucleotide polymorphism markers were detected within  <dig> kb regions of arabidopsis candidate genes, including bnflc.a <dig> accounts for ~23 % of natural variation in diverse accessions  <cit> . numerous of predicted genes for other traits were obtained, such as phosphorus homeostasis  <cit>  and sps  <cit> . to facilitate the utilization of qtls for the brassica community, comparative mapping among b. napus, arabidopsis, b. rapa and b. oleracea genomes is necessary to obtain candidate genes, and the released b. rapa, b. oleracea and b. napus genome information may accelerate map-based cloning .

a large population, a high-density genetic map and replicated experiments in multiple environments are considered as three key factors for increasing statistical power and precision in detecting qtls  <cit> . in our previous study, kn doubled haploid  population was derived from a cross between ‘kenc-8’ and ‘n53-2’, which contained  <dig> lines  <cit> . this population also showed high phenotypic variation for silique related traits. using kn dh population, the aim of this study was to detect qtls for sl, sb, st, sps, sv and sd in multiple environments, and to study the relationships among these traits . we also constructed a consensus map to perform qtl comparisons between different populations, and identified candidate genes through comparative genome analysis.

RESULTS
trait variation and correlation analysis among different silique traits
the phenotypic performance and frequency distribution of the silique traits in wuhan  and dali  were analyzed . the phenotypic data of these traits all showed continuous distributions. there was high phenotypic variation and transgressive segregation in the kn population, suggested that the segregation pattern of these traits in diverse experiments fitted a normal distribution and were suitable for qtl analysis . for instance, kn dh lines had maximum  and minimum  values of st, whereas the st of parental lines were  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm in 10dl . however, the parents do not always rank in the same way in some trials, such as the sl in 10dl, 11dl and 12dl environments , the possible reason was that the phenotypic data of the trait was similar and it had a sampling error.fig.  <dig> phenotypic variation of silique traits in kn dh lines and their parents. the numbers  <dig> and  <dig> represent kenc- <dig> and n53- <dig>  respectively. yield related traits were measured as: silique length , silique breadth , silique thickness , seed per silique, silique volume , seed density 



the results of correlation and linear model analysis among the seven traits are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  sl and sps showed significant positive correlations with five other traits, excluding tsw. sps and sd had the highest positive correlation coefficient  among all seven traits. tsw had significant positive correlations with sb, st and sv, suggesting that tsw could be increased by improving sb, st and sv. thus, information on the associations among tsw, sl, sb, st, sps, sv and sd is useful for breeders selecting a desirable genotype.table  <dig> phenotypic correlations among silique related traits, seed yield and yield-related traits in kn population

fig.  <dig> genetic linkage map and the locations of qtl for silique traits in kn map. the  <dig> linkage groups with qtls are represented by vertical bars designated as a1-a <dig> in a genome and c1-c <dig> in c genome, based on multiple anchor markers located on each chromosome. the loci names are listed on the right of the linkage groups, and the position of loci is shown on the left side of linkage groups, given in cm. the identified qtls associated with the seven silique traits are indicated by bars with various backgrounds to the left of each linkage group. 



sixteen identified qtls for sl were detected with the phenotypic variation explained  in the range of  <dig>  %– <dig>  % . the  <dig> identified qtls were integrated into  <dig> consensus qtls , and two  and one  consensus qtls were detected in three and two microenvironments, respectively. among these identified qtls, qtl qsl-a6- <dig> showed the largest pve of  <dig>  % and had the lod value of  <dig>  . in order to identify its effect, genotypes of the dh population were collected for the closely linked marker cb <dig> on a <dig> of this qtl. in 10dl and 13wh, dh lines carrying the ‘n53-2’  had an average length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , while dh lines carrying the ‘kenc-8’  had an average length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. there was no significant difference when comparing lines carrying ‘b’ with lines carrying ‘a’ , and the non difference between the alleles based on cb <dig> could be due to recombination between the markers and the causative genes.table  <dig> effect analysis of qtls relative higher phenotype variance explanation for the silique related traits

for sb,  <dig> identified qtls were obtained with pve ranging from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  % . finally, these  <dig> identified qtls were integrated into  <dig> consensus qtls, including each two consensus qtls were detected in three and two microenvironments . qtls cqsb-c6- <dig> and cqsb-c6- <dig> with pve >10 % were considered as major qtls, as they were repeatedly detected in three microenvironments . among the identified qtls, qsb-c6- <dig> had the highest pve and had a relatively high lod value of  <dig> . to identify its effect, genotype data of the dh population for the nearest marker e4m5- <dig> on c <dig> was collected, and a similar result for sl was observed .

for st,  <dig> identified qtls were obtained with pve of  <dig>  %– <dig>  % . the  <dig> qtls were integrated into  <dig> consensus qtls, and two qtls were detected in two microenvironments . qtl qst-a9- <dig>  with the highest pve of  <dig>  %, was closely linked with marker e8m13– <dig> on a <dig>  and the phenotypic data of dh lines carrying ‘a’ alleles was significantly smaller than lines carrying ‘b’ alleles, suggesting that alleles responsible for increasing st existed in the male parent ‘kenc-8’ .

for sv,  <dig> identified qtls with pve of  <dig>  %– <dig>  % were obtained . the  <dig> identified qtls were finally integrated into  <dig> consensus qtls, including one and three qtls were detected in three and two microenvironments, respectively . qtl cqsv-c6- <dig> that integrated from qsv-c6- <dig> , qsv-c6- <dig>  and qsv-c6- <dig>  was considered as a major qtl. further investigation revealed that the phenotypic data of lines carrying ‘a’ and ‘b’ alleles of tightly linked marker na12a <dig> on c <dig>  showed significant differences. the average sv was significantly larger in lines carrying ‘a’ alleles than ‘b’ alleles, suggesting that the genes responsible for increasing sv exist in the female parent ‘n53-2’ .

eight qtls for sps with pve within the range of  <dig>  %– <dig>  % were obtained , and then were integrated into six consensus qtls. qtl cqsps-c6- <dig> was detected in three environments , which was integrated from qsps-c6- <dig>  qsps-c6- <dig> and qsps-c6- <dig> with pve of  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. qtl qsps-c6- <dig>  was closely linked with marker cb <dig> on c <dig>  and further analysis revealed that the related phenotypic data of lines carrying ‘a’ alleles had significantly more sps, on average, than lines carrying ‘b’ alleles. this suggests that the genes increasing sps existed in the male parent ‘n53-2’ .

for sd, six qtls were identified with pve of  <dig>  %– <dig>  % , none of these were considered as major qtl. the six identified qtls were integrated into five consensus qtls. only cqsd-c6- <dig> was detected in two microenvironments .

forty-two qtls for tsw were detected in eight experiments, and  <dig> consensus qtls were obtained, and three and six consensus qtls were detected in four and two microenvironments, respectively   <cit> . the pve of these qtls were within the range of  <dig>  %– <dig>  %. qtls cqsw-a7- <dig> and cqsw-c1- <dig> were two major qtls with pve >10 % in two different experiments, respectively.

detection of pleiotropic unique qtls for silique related traits
there were significant phenotypic correlations among the seven traits , which was also reflected by the genomic location and the effects of the corresponding qtls. a trait-by-trait meta-analysis revealed that the  <dig> consensus qtls for the seven traits  were integrated into  <dig> unique qtls . among them,  <dig> unique qtls have pleiotropic effects and control at least two traits . these unique qtls were generally classified into two kinds: unique qtls integrated from qtls with the same direction of additive effect, and qtls with opposite additive effect directions . for instance, uqc6- <dig> obtained from qtls controlling six silique related traits except for sl with positive additive effect , which was in accordance with the significant positive correlations among these traits. however, uqa2- <dig> belonged to the second kind, the additive effect of cqsps-a <dig>  was negative while cqsw-a2- <dig>  was positive , which might explain the negative phenotype correlation between sps and tsw. in addition, qtl uqc6- <dig> was integrated from qtls controlling sv, sl, tsw and sps that exhibited the same direction of parental contribution. this result might explain the negative but low correlation between sps and tsw, and the positive but low correlation between sl and tsw.table  <dig> the list of  <dig> pleiotropic unique qtl for silique related traits in kn population

consensus map construction and qtl comparison
five mapping populations  were selected for construction of consensus map and qtl comparison . for exact comparisons among populations, qtls collected in each population were used in the first round of meta-analysis to obtain consensus qtls . the kn dh map was treated as a reference map, and the markers and qtls were projected from the five chosen populations onto the kn map. finally, a consensus map containing  <dig> markers was constructed, with the exceptions of a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> that lacked a common marker . a total of  <dig> consensus qtls, including  <dig> on the a genome and  <dig> on the c genome, were located from the chosen five populations . finally,  <dig> qtls , including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> qtls controlling sl, sd, sps and tsw were aligned to the consensus map, respectively . the number of aligned qtls on each chromosome ranged from one  to  <dig> .

for tsw, qtls with overlapping cis among different populations were observed on a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> . for the other six traits, no common qtls were detected among the different populations. on chromosome a <dig>  four qtls were projected from tn and ss populations. qtls ss-qsl-a <dig> and cqsps-a <dig> were co-localized in the ci of  <dig> – <dig>  cm. on chromosome a <dig>  three qtls were projected from tn onto kn, and qtl tn-qtsw-a2- <dig> had an overlapping ci with cqsb-a <dig>  eleven qtls were projected from tn, hy and be onto kn on a <dig>  among them, tn-qtsw-a3- <dig> and cqsw-a3- <dig>  and tn-qtsw-a3- <dig> and cqsb-a3- <dig> were co-localized with overlapping cis. qtls tn-qtsw-a3- <dig>  tn-qtsw-a3- <dig> and be-cqsps-a <dig> had overlapping cis with cqsw-a3- <dig>  on chromosome a <dig>  two qtls were projected from the tn population and tn-qtsw-a4- <dig> co-localized with cqsb-a <dig> and cqsw-a <dig>  four qtls on chromosome a <dig> were projected from tn onto the consensus map, with cqsps-a <dig> and tn-qtsw-a5- <dig>  and cqst-a5- <dig> and tn-qtsw-a5- <dig> co-localized. on chromosome c <dig>  one qtl was aligned from tn with an overlapping ci with cqsd-c9- <dig> and cqst-c9- <dig>  two qtls were projected from the qn population on chromosome c <dig>  while no qtl was detected on c <dig> in the kn population . in addition, on a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  ss, tn, qn and qn had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> projected qtls, respectively, and all of them differed from the qtls detected in the present study. compared with the abovementioned five populations,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consensus qtls might be the first detected for sb, st and sv, while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> consensus qtls for sl, sps, sd and tsw were potential new qtls, respectively . especially for sl and sd, qtls on a <dig> and c <dig> might be the first detected. these conserved qtls repeatedly detected in different populations might provide target qtls for breeders and map-based cloning of genes contributing to these silique traits in b. napus, and newly detected qtls might increase our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of these traits.fig.  <dig> qtl comparison of the seven traits among different populations. qtls obtained in kn dh population are shown on the outside circle. the inside circles represent qtls projected from the tn, ss, be, qn and hy populations, respectively. different traits are indicated by bars with various backgrounds . the grey traits indicated that qtls detected in different population were co-localized



comparative genome analysis and candidate gene identification
on the basis of the distribution of  <dig> conserved chromosomal blocks of arabidopsis described by schranz et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> blocks and  <dig> islands in the kn dh map were identified with respect to the arabidopsis genome according to  <dig> markers with known sequence information  <cit> .

all of the qtls with cis containing homologous genes were separately compared to the physical genomic regions of b. rapa  and b. oleracea  . based on the map alignment between arabidopsis and b. napus, a total of  <dig> orthologs of  <dig> genes that controlled these silique traits in arabidopsis were mapped onto the synteny blocks and islands , and  <dig> genes were located in the ci of  <dig> qtls . among the  <dig> genes, several were shown to have a relationship with the seven silique traits, including exs, gasa <dig>  ant, ttg <dig> and ap <dig>  especially on chromosome c <dig>  gene atagp <dig>  and cul3b  were associated with unique qtls controlling sv, sd, st and sw. the atagp <dig> mutant could lead to fewer siliques, less seed production and several abnormalities in cell size, number, shape and packing  <cit> . cul3b is essential for normal embryogenesis  <cit> . at the same time, sequences of these genes available for b. rapa and b. oleracea were also mapped onto related chromosomes .

discussion
in the present study, the genetic basis for the six silique traits  at qtl level was performed in the kn dh population containing  <dig> lines, possibly the largest population yet used to perform qtl mapping for silique traits. sl is known to be positively correlated with sps  <cit> , and the same result was also obtained in the present study. no significant positive relationship was observed between sl and tsw, which differed from previous results  <cit> . the most persuasive explanation for the phenomenon was that the population used in the present study was different from other published populations, and each mapping population might carry different alleles for silique related traits and represent its own genetic background. for example, yang et al.  indicated that sl was significantly correlated with sw, using a ril derived from a cross between an ems mutant with extremely long sl and sw, and an inbred line with regular sl and sw  <cit> . by comparison, the kn population for sl and sw showed high phenotypic variation but the two parents showed no significant difference. to date, little research has been conducted on sb, st and sv and their relationships with other yield-related factors. in this study, sl, sb and sv all showed significant positive relationships with sps and sd . the present results revealed that sps was significant negatively correlated with tsw, as also observed by zhang et al.   <cit> . it is noteworthy that all the six silique traits in the present study showed highly and positively correlated with the level of seed yield , suggesting that at least some of the underlying genetic determinism or same genes are shared across the formation and development of these traits. these silique traits colud be served as important traits for section of high yield cultivar for breeding purpose. these results suggest that coordinating the balance among these agronomic traits of b. napus was the premise of ensuring the high and stable yield production.

fine mapping and map-based cloning are efficient ways to dissect the genetic bases of quantitative traits and to identify genes underlying these traits. qtls with large pve and can be detected in different environments are more suitable for fine mapping and map-based cloning  <cit> . integrating qtl results across different environments can determine which qtls are less influenced by environmental factors, and can help to isolate environment-specific qtls  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> stable consensus qtls expressed in at least two microenvironments, and  <dig> environment-specific qtls were obtained . the high proportion of environment-specific qtls suggested a large impact of the natural environment on silique-associated traits. most of them had minor effects with low lod scores. it is clear that use such minor qtls for mas or clone such qtls via fine mapping is unlikely. however, these qtls provide an important genetic resource for further research  <cit> . the explanation for the existence of stable qtls was that they could be responsible for main genetic effects with high lod scores, as qtls with major effects are more likely to be stable across multiple environments  <cit> . in the present study, three qtls with pve > 10 % controlling sb  and sv  were identified in at least three microenvironments in dl . in addition, cqsb-c6- <dig> and cqsb-c6- <dig> were both integrated from three identified qtls detected in dl and with mean additive effects of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . these results showed that when alleles from ‘kenc-8’ existed in the two qtls, the sb could increase about  <dig>  mm in dl. these kinds of qtls might be worthy of attention when doing mas for developing varieties with special adaptability. in addition, unique qtl uqc6- <dig> would be the most interesting for breeding. the uqc6- <dig> could control as much as six traits except for sl, which were all with positive additive effect. compared with the seed yield and oil content qtls detected in the same population, uqc6- <dig> was co-localized with the major qtl for seed yield , which was repeatedly detected in three environments  <cit> , and was also co-localized with the qtl  for seed oil content consistently expressed in four environments  <cit> . among the two parents of kn dh population, ‘kenc-8’ was the parental of the variety ‘zayou59’ released in  <dig> in china, and ‘n53-2’ was a dh line with seed oil content >50 %  <cit> . qtls detected in kn population could be used in breeding, not only for developing high-yielding cultivars, but also for increasing seed oil content.

although the genetic determinism of these silique traits remain largely unknown in rapeseed, correlation analysis with the same dh population may provide some insights. most pairs of traits showed significant phenotypic correlations in this study, which was also reflected by the genome location and effects of qtl detected. many qtl clusters were observed on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> . with the overlapping cis of qtls controlling different traits,  <dig> unique qtls that controlled at least two traits were obtained and the unique qtl  could control as much as six traits . co-localizations between qtls for some traits were expected such for sb/st/tsw due to the correlation . this were also in agreement with the pleiotropic unique qtls, such as uqa9- <dig> and uqc6- <dig> control the three traits simultaneously, and uqa3- <dig> and uqa7- <dig> have effect on sb and tsw, and uqa3- <dig> and uqc6- <dig> effect sb and st simultaneously, and uqc9- <dig> have effect on st and sw . previous studies on silique traits also demonstrated the existence of pleiotropic qtls in b. napus  <cit> . in addition, the consistency of qtl loci on the chromosome for various traits may facilitate selection efficiency by selecting markers closely associated with these traits. furthermore, if the direction of the additive effect of the qtls were the same, selection would be easier and more effective, such as for qtls clustered in the same region of c <dig> .

in general, a consensus map is a powerful tool to validate conserved qtls across populations. to compare qtls detected in different populations, a consensus map containing  <dig> markers was constructed . to our knowledge, there are few reports concerning qtl analysis for sb, st and sv, and the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consensus qtls in the present study might be new qtls. compared with  <dig> projected qtls from other five maps, three qtls for tsw were the same as those identified in previous studies, including cqsw-a3- <dig>  cqsw-a3- <dig> and cqsw-a <dig>  in addition,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consensus qtls for sl, sps and sd observed in the present study were differed from those of the other five populations, and hence might considered as potential new qtls. the detected qtls for sl had very high pve, reaching  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % on a <dig>  <cit> , while no qtl for sl was obtained on a <dig> in the present study, possibly due to only minor differences in sl between the two parents. comparison among different populations would also facilitate an assessment of intraspecific variation for these qtls.

the establishment of comparative mapping between arabidopsis and b. napus is a powerful tool to identify candidate genes underlying qtls  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> candidate genes were assigned to the cis of  <dig> qtls , and several of these genes were shown to have a relationship with the six silique traits. studies have revealed that the genes ant, arf <dig> and toc <dig> underlying qtls exist on chromosomes a1–a <dig>  <cit> , whereas ant underlying qtls aligned on a <dig> and c <dig> was observed in the present study. fan et al.  detected qtls for tsw on a <dig>  which might correspond to ttg <dig> and mini <dig>  <cit> , whereas ttg <dig> underlying qtls was aligned on a <dig> and a <dig> in the present results. as well as ant, ttg <dig> and mini <dig>  gene exs that controlled embryo development was aligned in the cis of qtls controlling sps  <cit> . gasa <dig>  which positively affected both seed size and total seed yield, was located in the ci of a qtl controlling tsw  <cit> . ap <dig> was found underlying qtls controlling tsw on a <dig> and sl on c <dig>  and ap <dig> mutants could produce larger seeds than wild type  <cit> . on a <dig>  iku <dig> controlling seed size was located in the ci of qtls controlling sps and st  <cit> . genes fis <dig> and mea were aligned in the cis of qtls controlling sps and st on a <dig> and qtls controlling sl and st on a <dig>  respectively. these two genes repressed seed development in the absence of pollination  <cit> . on c <dig>  cul3a was associated with qtls controlling sl, which is essential for normal embryogenesis  <cit> . atagp <dig> and cul3b were associated with unique qtls controlling sv, sd, st and sw; and the atagp <dig> mutant had fewer siliques, less seed production and several abnormalities in cell size, number, shape and packing  <cit> . compared with currently published b. napus genome information, related b. napus genome information was also obtained. these findings provided useful resources on candidate genes for seed yield improvement.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> individual qtls for six silique traits , and then integrated these qtls into  <dig> consensus qtls by meta-analysis. among them, all of the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> consensus qtls for sb, st and sv might be the potential new qtls because few qtls for these traits were reported in b. napus. after compared with five published populations,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> potential new consensus qtls for sl, sps and sd were obtained. by in silico mapping analysis, we identified  <dig> candidate genes underlying  <dig> qtls for silique related traits. our results provided useful information into the regulatory model for the control of silique in b. napus.
