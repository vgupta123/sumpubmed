BACKGROUND
fruit trees, like most perennial woody plants, have a long juvenile phase before flowering and fruiting . studies of the mechanisms involved in juvenile development and the juvenile to adult phase transition are vital for shortening the juvenile phase and accelerating the breeding of economically beneficial traits in woody plants, especially in apple trees. rootstock breeding is an important aspect of fruit breeding, since many apple trees are propagated by grafting a scion on a rootstock, such as t <dig> and m <dig>  shortening the rootstock’s juvenile phase is necessary for early flowering and fruiting of several scion varieties  <cit> . presently, china produces more apples than any other country in the world and up to 90% of the rootstocks are bred using seed propagation  <cit> . malus hupehensis, which originated in pingyi, shandong province, is an important apple rootstock that undergoes apomixis at a rate greater than 95%  <cit> .

many species have long juvenile vegetative phases. this may be associated with the biological processes involved in hormone synthesis and metabolism, carbohydrate synthesis and metabolism, and photosynthesis  <cit> . it has been reported that carbohydrates play an important role in the reproductive development of olive trees,  <cit>  and that the squamosa promoter binding protein -box genes spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> control morphological changes in arabidopsis reproduction  <cit> . transgenic experiments in populus trichocarpa and arabidopsis, indicate that the terminal flower  <dig>  gene expression level affects the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase  <cit> . additionally, other genes, including the mads-box family of transcription factor  genes in citrus, are involved in the juvenile to adult transition  <cit> . these control mechanisms represent a preliminary understanding of the molecular base of the transition from juvenile to adult phase in plants.

micrornas  play an important role in the regulating the juvenile to adult phase transition in annual plants  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis thaliana, high levels of mir <dig> reduced the expression levels of spl tfs, which activated suppressor of constans  <dig> , leafy , agamous-like  <dig> , fruitfull  and apetala <dig>  genes that regulate the transition from juvenile to adult phase  <cit> . mir <dig> acts in several pathways that control different aspects of vegetative development and play an important role in the juvenile phase  <cit> . mir <dig> down-regulates glossy <dig> expression, which promotes the vegetative phase change in maize  <cit> . in perennial woody species, related studies on the molecular mechanisms of phase change have been performed  <cit> . the overexpression of mir <dig> in transgenic populus × canadensis reduced the expression of mir156-targeted spl genes and mir <dig>  and drastically prolonged the juvenile phase  <cit> . the increase in ssmir <dig> and decrease in ssmir <dig> during plant rejuvenation showed that these two mirnas affect phase transition in sequoia sempervirens <cit> .

plant hormones are known to play an important role in the juvenile to adult phase transition and in plant flowering  <cit> . currently, the mirna-mediated regulation of plant growth, development and flowering through phytohormone crosstalk and other developmental processes mainly involves six classes of phytohormones, auxin , cytokinin , abscisic acid , gibberellic acid , ethylene  and jasmonic acid   <cit> . it was reported that ga accelerates flowering through the degradation of transcription repressors, dellas, and that dellas directly bind to mirna156-targeted tfs , which promote flowering by activating mir <dig> and mads-box genes  <cit> .

we determine if mirnas are involved in hormone regulation during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in apple trees. additionally, we investigated the complex hormonal and mirna-mediated regulatory networks in which the mirnas associated with phase transition control plant growth, development and the transition to flowering.

methods
plant material and rna isolation
leaf samples from the apple demonstration nursery of yangling modern agriculture technology park , shaanxi province of china , were collected directly into liquid nitrogen. in june, ‘adult phase’  leaves were collected as mixed samples from the tops of  <dig> 6-year-old m. hupehensis  rehd. trees and ‘juvenile phase’  leaves were collected from the base. since m. hupehensis has the ability to undergo apomixis at a rate greater than 95%, their growth is highly synchronous. roots, stems, flowers and fruits were also collected in the same manner at the same time. the samples were stored in a −80°c freezer until used . additionally, leaf samples were collected from the tops of m. hupehensis of different ages  . two leaf samples, a and j, were used for small rna and degradome sequencing, and the samples were used for qrt-pcr to verify the expression patterns of mirna and their targets . total rna was isolated from each sample by a modified method  <cit> .figure  <dig>

construction of small rna and degradome libraries
small rna construction and deep sequencing of the a and j leaf samples was carried out by the beijing genomics institute   using an illumina genome analyzer  <cit> . total rna extractions from a and j leaves were performed using the rneasyplant mini kit  and collected into a and j rna pools. briefly, 18–30-nt gel fragments were selected and then ligated to a pair of adapters at the 5′- and 3′-ends using t <dig> rna ligase. the small rnas with the adapters were transcribed into cdna using super-script ii reverse transcriptase , and then the cdna products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction . finally, the purified pcr products were directly sequenced using solexa sequencing technology . the leaf total rna from the j sample was also used for degradome sequencing and library construction as previously described  <cit> , as well as for mirna target identification.

bioinformatics analyses of sequencing data
raw reads produced using an illumina 1g genome analyzer at bgi were processed into clean full-length reads by removing the low-quality reads  by a data-cleaning pipeline. all high-quality sequences were queried using ncbi genbank  databases and rfam databases , and used for further analyses. the small rna tags were annotated with rrna, scrna, snorna, snrna and trna using the tag2annotation software developed by bgi. to map every unique small rna to only one annotation, we followed the following priority rule: rrnaetc  > known mirna > repeat > exon > intron <dig> .

identification of known mirnas and prediction of novel mirnas in m. hupehensis rehd
to identify known mirnas in m. hupehensis, the mirna categories were mapped to the reference genome malus domestica in mirbase  <dig>   with the criterion that sequences in the small rna libraries  have less than two mismatches and more than  <dig> matches without gaps. mirnas that could not be annotated were used to predict novel mirna using the software mireap  developed by the bgi. additionally, the characteristic structures of mirna precursors, including hairpins, secondary structures, dicer cleavage sites and the minimum free energy, were used to predict novel mirnas with the mireap pipeline . the criteria included hairpin mirnas that can fold into necessary secondary structures and mature mirnas that are present in one arm of the hairpin precursors. additionally, the free energy of hybridization must be lower than or equal to −18 kcal/mol, and the mature mirna strand and its complementary strand  must contain 2-nt 3' overhangs.

target prediction and identification
we identified targets by degradome sequencing  <cit> . briefly, we matched the degraded fragments to the apple genome  and removed ncrnas, as well as polyn fragments, in the samples to reduce interference. we then used pairfinder software developed by the bgi degradome group to predict potential mrna-mirna pairings . to predict potential functions of the putative mirna targets in various biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components we used gene ontology  categories  to classify the identified target genes  <cit> . additionally, the kegg database  was used for kegg pathway analyses.

qrt-pcr validation of mirnas and their targets
cdnas of mirnas and targets were generated from 2 μg of total rnas of 24 m. hupehensis samples  using mircute mirna cdna  and primescript™ rt reagent kit with gdna eraser  . qrt-pcr was performed using a mirna qpcr detection kit  with 10 μl of 2x mircute mirna premix with rox and sybr green , and  <dig>  μm of forward and reverse primers in a 20-μl system for the expression of mirnas. pcr was also performed using sybr® premix ex taq™ ii  with 10 μl of 2x sybr® premix ex taq ii, and  <dig>  μl of forward and reverse primers in a 20-μl system to determine the expression of the targets . the reactions were incubated in a bio-rad  for 30 s at 95°c, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°c and 35 s at 60°c, followed by 81 cycles for the melt curve. each reaction was performed in three replicates. all primers used in the qrt-pcr experiments are listed in additional file  <dig> 

leaf morphology characteristics and hormone contents
the juvenile leaves from the bases of the trees and the adult leaves from the tops of the trees were used to measure and calculate the length, width, area and dry weight . the methods of hormone extraction and determination in leaves were carried out as previously described  <cit> .

RESULTS
construction and sequencing of small rna and degradome libraries
to determine responsive srnas in the juvenile and adult vegetative phases, a and j mirna libraries were constructed and sequenced a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated by the high-throughput illumina hiseq.  <dig> sequencing system, with  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the a and j libraries, respectively . after processing primary reads,  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  total clean reads were selected from the a and j libraries, respectively. we also constructed a degradome library using total rna from the j sample . the size distributions of the reads in the a and j libraries were quite similar, but there was at least 50% more 21-nt length reads in the juvenile library compared with the adult library . the length of the srna varied from  <dig> to 28 nt in the samples, and 21-, 23- and 24-nt small rnas formed the major population with 24 nt being the most dominant, which is similar to the results obtained from most tested plants, including a. thaliana and brassica juncea. the sequencing data have been deposited in ncbi sequence read archive . and accession number was srp <dig>  meanwhile, related data have been already deposited in gene expression omnibus . and accession number was gse <dig> table  <dig>

the srna reads were grouped based on their identities  as determined by mapping them to the domesticated apple’s genome  using soap <dig> software  <cit> . approximately, a half and a third of the unique srna sequences for a and j matched this genome, respectively . the reads were categorized into different classes of srnas, including rrna, mirna, snrna, snorna and repeats, by matching them with the domesticated apple’s genome in the rfam  and genbank  databases using the tag2annotation software. the repeats, mirnas and rrnas formed the major population, and repeats were the most dominant class of srna; however, the majority of srnas remained unannotated. for almost every type of srna, a number of unique srnas were shared between the a and j libraries .table  <dig>

known mirna and expression levels
to identify the known mirnas in m. hupehensis  rehd., the srnas in the two libraries were queried using blastn to known mature plant mirnas of m. domestica in the mirbase  <dig>   and plant mirna  databases  <cit> . a total of  <dig> known mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified . different sequences are cloned into libraries at different frequencies, so the read numbers of different mirna species may be biased by the methods of mirnas library construction. this potential problem can be addressed by using a new method of mirnas library construction, increasing the sample size or improving the accuracy of the data analysis and comparisons . the number of members within different mirna families varied significantly. a majority of the  <dig> known mirna families had several members, and five families, mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig>  had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. seven of the known mirna families, mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig>  had only one member .figure  <dig> 
numbers of identified mirnas in known mirna families in
malus hupehensis.




the expression levels of known mirnas were determined by their sequence count frequencies in the a and j libraries. some mirnas showed library-specific expression patterns and the frequency of members from the same or different mirna families varied greatly in each library, ranging from one to  <dig>  additionally, the expression levels of some mirnas, including mdm-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were found at very low levels, with read counts ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> between the a and j libraries. others, including mdm-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  had high expression levels, with read counts that reached more than  <dig>  in each library .

analyzing known mirna expression levels between the a and j libraries revealed that the  <dig> known mirna families  were differentially expressed . among these, the expression levels of mdm-mir <dig> and  <dig> other mirna family members, mdm-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the j library were significantly higher than in the a library . however, the expression levels of mdm-mir <dig> and four other mirna family members, mdm-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were significantly higher in the a library than in the j library . we also found that mdm-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed no significant differences in expression levels between the a and j libraries . the different expression patterns of known mirnas in the a and j libraries may reflect a divergence in their potential biological functions during the phase transition from vegetative growth to reproductive growth.figure  <dig>

putative novel mirna in m. hupehensis
the reference genome sequences of the domesticated apple  were used to predict potential novel mirnas. in this study, several mirna characteristics, including the mirna precursor’s hairpin structure, which was predicted by the software mireap , the dicer cleavage site and the minimum free energy of the unannotated srna tags, which could be mapped to the genome, were used to identify putative novel mirnas. we also used  <dig> reads per million as a cutoff to eliminate mirnas with low expression levels. we identified  <dig> putative unique m. hupehensis  rehd. mirnas in the a and j srna libraries . the lengths of the predicted novel mirna hairpin structures ranged from  <dig> to 242 nt. we also found that a majority of identified novel mirna sequences were at the 5′-ends of the hairpins rather than the 3′-ends .

of the  <dig> novel mirnas,  <dig> were highly expressed in at least one library , and novel_mir <dig>  novel_mir <dig> and novel_mir <dig> were the most highly expressed novel mirnas . when comparing the expression levels of these novel mirnas between the a and j libraries, some of the putative novel mirnas showed distinctive expression profiles. for example,  <dig> were expressed only in the j library, including novel_mir <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the expression of another  <dig>  including novel_mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were detected only in the a library . additionally,  <dig> novel mirnas, including novel_mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were expressed significantly higher in the j library than in the a library ; however, the expression levels of novel_mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were significantly lower in the j library than in the a library . we also found that another  <dig> novel mirnas, including novel_mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were similarly expressed in both the a and j libraries . in summary, our results showed that the known and novel mirnas presented highly diverse expression patterns between the libraries, indicating that they may play different roles in phase-associated biological processes.figure  <dig>

targets of known and novel mirnas
to explore the functions of the identified mirnas, known and novel, in diverse biological processes and obtain insights into the mechanisms of the juvenile to adult transition in apple trees, we identified their targets by degradome sequencing . in total,  <dig> targets of  <dig> known mirna families, including mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig>  were detected in our library . the distributions of known mirnas and their target cleavage sites are shown in an additional file  <dig>  we also detected  <dig> unique targets of  <dig> unique novel mirnas . the distributions of novel mirnas and their target cleavage sites are shown in an additional file  <dig>  in most cases, a single mirna regulated multiple targets. for example, mdm-mir <dig> regulated  <dig> genes, including the sbp domain, spl <dig>  spl <dig> and acyl-coa synthetase <dig>  however, in some cases, single genes were targeted by several mirnas. the myb domain protein  <dig> was targeted by both mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig>  and the autoinhibited ca2 + −atpase was regulated by both mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig>  the known mirna targets included some tfs, including spl <dig> , spl <dig> , arf <dig>  and myb <dig> , and others contained several regulatory proteins, including the letm1-like protein , aux signaling f-box  <dig> protein  and the at hook motif dna-binding family protein  . we also identified several novel mirna targets, including some regulatory proteins and some tfs. for example, novel_mir <dig>  novel_mir <dig> and novel_mir <dig> targeted genes encoding a c2h2-like zinc finger protein, the myb domain protein <dig> and a sbp family protein, respectively. additionally, novel_mir <dig> targeted the ring/u-box and integrase-type dna-binding superfamily proteins .table  <dig>

go and kegg analyses of the degradome predicted target genes
a total of  <dig> go terms from various biological processes were identified . a total of  <dig> known mirna targets were associated with processes such as the growth, regulation of developmental processes, hormone-mediated signaling pathways, and organ, flower and reproductive developmental processes, which are thought to be associated with the juvenile to adult transition. to better understand their biological functions, we also identified  <dig> go terms for the predicted targets of the putative novel mirnas . they were associated with plant growth and development.

the go analysis also revealed that the known mirnas’ potential targets were associated with the biological processes of the juvenile to adult transition . for example, the targets of mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig> were associated with growth and flower development in plants. the targets of mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig> were associated with aux- and hormone-mediated signaling pathways, which play important roles in the reproductive growth of plants.table  <dig> 
go analyses showing that mirnas from

leaves potentially target the juvenile to adult transition-related biological processes




a total of  <dig> kegg pathways were enriched for targets of known mirnas . the categories of plant hormone signal transduction and metabolic pathways contained the most targets, at  <dig> %. the majority of the targets were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction, which play important roles in plant growth and development. a few of these targets were involved in the p <dig> signaling pathway, glycan degradation and purine metabolism, which may regulate metabolism and synthesis in plants. additionally, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> pathways containing targets of novel mirnas were detected at significantly high abundance levels  . the majority of novel mirna targets were associated with rna polymerase or involved in plant-pathogen interactions and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.

identification by qrt-pcr of differentially expressed mirnas and their targets in a and j leaves
to examine the expression levels of mirnas and their targets during different developmental leaf tissue stages  between the a and j samples, as well as to confirm the sequencing results, we examined expression levels of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> targets by qrt-pcr . the up-regulation in j compared with a was confirmed for mdm-mir <dig> during leaf development , while its targets, spl <dig> and spl <dig>  showed higher expression levels in a than in j from march to august, with their levels gradually increasing . the qrt-pcr experiments also validated the deep-sequencing results of the down-regulation in j compared with a leaves for mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir398a and mdm-mir398a in april, may and june . the expression levels of mdm-mir <dig> targets ap <dig> and ap2-like were significantly higher in j than in a leaves during early leaf development ; however, they were relatively low later  . the dc <dig>  and adh <dig>  gene patterns were similar to those of ap <dig> and ap2-like . mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig> were up-regulated in j compared with a during the early leaf development stage , while most of their targets showed significantly higher expression levels in a than in j. additionally, we found that afb <dig> and afb <dig>  were detected in a but were almost undetectable in j leaves  . the expression of tir <dig>  was higher in a than in j during april, may and august, but was lower in a than in j during july and august .figure  <dig>

hierarchical clustering of known mirnas and targets by expression levels in the a and j leaves of m. hupehensis resulted in six and five major clusters, respectively . the mirnas within cluster  <dig>  typically displayed high expression levels during the later stages of leaf development , but mirnas within cluster  <dig>  displayed opposite results, with high expression levels during the early stages  . additionally, the targets of cluster  <dig>  displayed high expression levels in the early stages of leaf development ; however, the cluster  <dig> targets  showed the opposite results, with higher expression levels in later stages  . these data suggest that the expression patterns of mirnas and their targets, such as mir <dig> and spl <dig>  display opposite trends during leaf development.

identification by qrt-pcr of mirna and target expression patterns in leaves of different ages
we validated mirna and target expression profiles in leaves from the tops of trees of different ages  via qrt-pcr . mdm-mir <dig> had significantly higher expression levels in younger  than in older tree leaves  , whereas its targets  had relatively higher expression levels in older tree leaves  than in younger tree leaves  . compared with the expression profile of mdm-mirna <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> showed a high expression level in older tree leaves  and this expression increased gradually in 1- to 6-year-olds . a perfect inverse expression pattern was found for its targets, ap <dig> and ap2-like genes, which were expressed higher in younger than in older tree leaves . mdm-mir <dig> exhibited strong expression in 1-year-old leaves and the expression decreased gradually in 1- to 6-year-olds, whereas its targets’  expression increased to their highest levels in 4-year-olds but then decreased to relatively low levels in 5- and 6-year-olds . the expression of mdm-mir <dig> could barely be detected in older tree leaves  but was relatively high in young tree leaves  . interestingly, its targets  had an inverse expression pattern that was higher in older leaves  .figure  <dig>

additionally, the hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in these known mirnas and target genes forming three major clusters each, and it also showed that the expression levels of most known mirnas were inversely correlated with those of the corresponding targets among leaves of different ages .

identification by qrt-pcr of mirna and target expression patterns in different tissues
tissue-specific expression and hierarchical cluster analyses, which allowed known mirnas and their target genes into three major clusters each ,revealed that mirnas and their targets in different tissues  presented a variety of expression patterns . the expression patterns of these mirnas and their targets could be divided into four types:  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and their targets, the sbp, ap <dig>  ap2-like, arf <dig>  afb, dc <dig> and rd <dig> genes, had the highest expression levels in roots but relatively low expression levels in fruit ;  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir398a, mdm-mir398b and their targets, the spl <dig>  spl <dig> and aca <dig> genes, were found to be expressed most abundantly in flowers but had relatively low expression levels in fruit and roots ;  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and their targets, the arf <dig>  letm1-like and adh <dig> genes, showed high expression levels in leaf tissue but relatively low levels were observed in stems ;  mdm-mir <dig> and mdm-mir <dig> and their targets, the tir <dig> and myb <dig> genes, had high expression levels in fruit but low levels in stems .figure  <dig>

identification of novel mirna expression patterns in m. hupehensisby qrt-pcr
we have verified the expression of some novel mirnas by qrt-pcr in a and j leaves of m. hupehensis, as well as leaves of different ages and different tissues . novel-mir <dig> and novel-mir <dig> were detected as up-regulated in j compared with a from april to june, while novel-mir <dig> and novel-mir <dig> showed significantly higher expression levels in j than in a from may to june. we also found that novel-mir <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had relatively higher expression levels in leaves from young trees than from older trees . a tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that novel-mir <dig> and  <dig> expressed at a higher level in flower, while novel-mir <dig> had the highest expression in root .

leaf morphology characteristics and hormone content analysis
to determine the characteristics of a and j during leaf development, we measured leaf length, width and area, and dry weight from march to august, all of which were significantly higher in a compared with j . additionally, the leaf aux content increased from march to july and then decreased in august for a. the pattern of aux expression for j had a similar trend to a, but reached a peak in may, and the aux content was significantly higher in a than in j during later leaf growth stages  . the leaf ck content decreased gradually from march to august for both a and j, and was significantly higher in a than in j from march to june. however, the ck content was almost undetectable during july and august in both a and j leaves . the leaf ga content was significantly higher in j than in a from april to may, but there was no significant difference at any other time . the leaf aba content was significantly higher in a than in j from march to may, but this was reversed in july and august . the different levels of hormones between a and j leaves indicated that hormones play a vital role in leaf growth and development.figure  <dig>

discussion
leaf morphology is very different between the juvenile phase at the base of the trees and the adult phase at the top of the trees. our results showed that leaf traits, such as size and dry weight, were significantly higher in a than in j leaves , which was consistent with a previous study in a. thaliana <cit> . plant growth hormones, such as auxs, cks, ga and aba, have important roles in leaf development during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth  <cit> . spraying exogenous gas can cause a reversion from the adult to the juvenile vegetative phase, producing juvenile traits in newly formed leaves  <cit> . the level of ga was higher in juvenile tissue than in adult tissue of trees  <cit> , which was consistent with our results . in this study, aux, ck and aba contents were significantly higher in a than in j leaves, but the ga content showed the opposite result, indicating that hormone levels play an important role in the physiological processes surrounding the phase transition .

in this study, by constructing two srna libraries of m. hupehensis  rehd. using high-throughput sequencing, we identified  <dig> known mirnas that belonged to  <dig> mirna families . the majority were conserved in a. thaliana and peach  <cit> . among them,  <dig> of  <dig> known mirna families had higher expression levels in the j library than in the a library , while others showed an opposite expression pattern . additionally,  <dig> novel mirnas were identified based on the universal rules for novel mirna prediction and annotation  <cit> . of these,  <dig> were only expressed in the j library  and  <dig> were expressed only in the a library . the differential expression of known and novel mirnas may involve various biological functions in the regulation of leaf development, phase transition and reproductive growth. using degradome analysis, we also identified a total of  <dig> targets for  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> targets for  <dig> unique novel mirnas . the majority of these targets were relatively conserved in other species  <cit>  and regulated a variety of biological processes involved in developmental growth, hormone-mediated signaling pathways, flower development and reproductive processes in plants.

because we established only one mirna library from juvenile leaves and one from adult leaf, our results are limited and may not include all of the differences present . a study on mirna control of vegetative phase change in the gymnosperm sequoia sempervirens and the identification of srnas also provide evidence supporting our results  <cit> .

the go analyses revealed that mirna targets were mainly associated with the juvenile to adult transition during plant development . the majority of go terms were associated with plant growth and development , plant tissue growth and formation , meristem development  and hormone-mediated signaling pathways , which are all involved in the juvenile to adult transition-associated biological processes . the kegg analysis also revealed that the genes targeted by known and novel mirnas were largely involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, p <dig> signaling and the glycan degradation pathway, which play important roles in the juvenile to adult transition and reproductive growth in plants .

it was reported that mir <dig> regulated leaf development, showed juvenile characteristics when overexpressed in plants and had reduced expression levels in adult leaves  <cit> . this was consistent with our results that the expression level of mdm-mir <dig> in the j library was significantly higher than in the a library . additionally, mir <dig> regulated its targets, the spl family, through translational inhibition and gene silencing in a. thaliana <cit> . the overexpression of the targets spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig> resulted in increased cell numbers in leaves  <cit> . this lead to an increased leaf size in plants overexpressing spl <dig> and spl <dig>  additionally, the overexpression of spl <dig> and spl <dig> controlled shoot maturation and leaf initiation  <cit> . in this study, we confirmed the up-regulation of mdm-mir <dig> in j leaves compared with a leaves during leaf development . however, two of its targets, spl <dig> and spl <dig>  showed higher expression levels in a than in j leaves . previous research also showed that spl <dig> was expressed in the vegetative shoot apices, although the expression level of mirna <dig> was almost undetectable  <cit> . spl <dig>  as well as spl <dig>  expression levels in the leaf primordia affect the initiation of new leaves at the shoot apical meristem  <cit> , while expression levels of spl <dig>  along with spl <dig>  control the leaf lamina shape during shoot maturation in the reproductive phase  <cit> . additionally, mdm-mir <dig> was highly expressed in roots but had almost no expression in flowers; however, its targets, spl <dig> and spl <dig>  were more highly expressed in flowers than in other tissues . expression levels of mirna <dig> and their targets were associated with the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and the transition to flowering.

the increased expression of mirna <dig> and decreased expression of its targets  delayed flowering, whereas inhibiting mir <dig> expression accelerated flowering  <cit> . some genes involved in flowering were regulated by the expression levels of mirna <dig> and their targets in plants. for example, mir <dig> regulates flowering locus t expression in apical meristem to control temperature-responsive flowering in a. thaliana <cit> . lfy, ful and ap <dig> genes were directly activated by the mirna-targeted spl <dig> to control the timing of flower formation in a. thaliana <cit> . spl <dig> and spl <dig> also directly regulated and controlled mads-box gene expression levels that promote flowering  <cit> . our results showed that leaves in the juvenile phase were much smaller and had higher mirna <dig> expression levels and lower sbp, spl <dig> and spl <dig> expression levels compared with adult leaves, implying that mirna <dig> and its targets may play important roles in the juvenile to adult transition, leaf development and the transition to flowering.

previous research showed that mir <dig> could promote flowering, but that its targets were floral repressors, such as ap2-like, ap <dig>  eat <dig> and eat <dig>  which play important roles in the regulation of leaf traits in a. thaliana <cit> . mir <dig> may be involved in regulating the juvenile to adult transition during developmental stages  <cit> . we also found that the sit-mir <dig> family members’ expression levels were significantly higher in adult leaves and flower tissues in olives   <cit> . in our study, the expression of mdm-mir <dig> family members was significantly higher in the a leaf library than in the j leaf library, implying that they were active in adult stage maintenance . the qrt-pcr experiments also validated the deep-sequencing results of a down-regulation of mdm-mir <dig> in the j library compared with the a library during leaf development . however, the expression levels of the targets ap <dig> and ap2-like  were significantly higher in the j than in the a leaves from march to may . these expression trends were also detected in the leaves of trees of different ages . additionally, ap <dig> and ap2-like genes exhibited their highest expression levels in roots but had relatively low expression levels in flowers . our research showed that mirna <dig> and its targets participated in the regulation of the juvenile to adult phase transition and the formation of floral organs.

plant hormones, as major regulators, have roles in leaf growth, juvenile to adult phase transitioning and flowering  <cit> . aux is a key hormone that is important in hormone-mediated responses during plant development . it has been reported that aux response factors, arf <dig> and arf <dig>  are targets of mirna <dig> and regulate various biological processes of plant development in arabidopsis, maize and rice . the expression level of mirna <dig> was different between the on- and off-year, and its expression was higher in juvenile leaves than in mature leaves in olive trees  <cit> . in our study, we also found that mdm-mir <dig> was up-regulated in j leaves whereas its targets were up-regulated in a leaves, supporting the high-throughput data on mirna <dig> . mdm-mir <dig> exhibited high expression levels in young leaves, but arf <dig> and arf <dig> expressed higher in the relatively mature leaves . additionally, the aux signal f-box genes tir <dig>  afb <dig> and afb <dig> were negatively regulated by mirna <dig>  <cit> , confirming the high-throughput sequencing and qrt-pcr results. these showed that mirna <dig> expressed highly in j leaves, while its targets showed almost no expression . an exogenous aux treatment could enhance mirna <dig> transcription and induce mir <dig> accumulation, indicating mirna <dig> regulated tir <dig> through a feedback control during the plant development process  <cit> . our results showed that the aux content and the expression of the targets  of mirna <dig> and mirna <dig> were significantly higher in a leaves than in j leaves , indicating an important contribution of hormone-mediated responses to leaf maturation, reproductive growth and the flowering transition.

we also found that other mirna family members identified by high-throughput sequencing were differentially expressed between the a and j libraries . these results were corroborated by qrt-pcr . the expression profiles of mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated in j leaves compared with a leaves during leaf development, while mdm-mir398a and mdm-mir398b were down-regulated in j leaves compared with a leaves, implying that these mirnas may participate in the regulating leaf development and other biological processes . meanwhile, the expression profiles of their targets presented opposite results for a and j leaves, which was also supported by qrt-pcr results . this was consistent with a previous study on cotton, which showed that the expression of mirnas  and their targets  had opposite expression patterns  <cit> . the expression patterns of mir <dig> and their targets  were also similar to those found in apple  <cit>  and peach trees   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive study on m. hupehensis mirnas related to the juvenile to adult phase transition was performed. in this study, we identified  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas from two srna libraries. additionally, using a degradome analysis, we identified  <dig> targets of the  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> targets of the  <dig> unique novel mirnas. a go analysis showed that these mirnas and their targets participated in regulating phase transition and reproductive growth during plant development. our results showed that the juvenile to adult phase transition and flowering were controlled by mdm-mirna <dig> and mdm-mirna <dig>  mdm-mir <dig> is highly abundant in j leaves and decreases in a leaves, while mdm-mir <dig> has the opposite expression pattern in the two leave types. the mirna-mediated regulation of multiple plant hormone pathways, such as the ga, aux, ck and aba, also plays key roles in phase transition and flowering during the plant life cycle. the identification of the mdm-mir160–target  and mdm-mir393–target  hormone-mediated expression patterns significantly improves our understanding of the roles mirnas play in the regulation of plant growth, development, reproductive phase transition and flowering. in general, the combination of srna and degradome sequencing can better illustrate the profiles of hormone-regulated mirnas and mirna targets involved in complex regulatory networks, thus contributing to the understanding of mirna functions during growth, phase transition and reproductive growth in perennial woody fruit trees.
