BACKGROUND
representing around 5% of vertebrate biodiversity  <cit> , catfishes  are classified in three suborders: diplomystoidei, with seven valid species distributed in andean areas of argentina and chile; siluroidei, summing  <dig> species distributed worldwide; and loricarioidei, endemic to the neotropical region with  <dig> valid species . as of march  <dig>  while one nuclear genome and  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes from siluroidei species were deposited in genbank, only four loricarioidei species had their mitochondrial genome sequence publicly released . this disproportion is even greater for general nucleotide sequences; for which the number of siluroidei entries is almost  <dig> times the amount for loricarioidei .table  <dig> disproportion of genetic information among siluriformes’ suborders. different types of entries in ncbi database, as well as the number of available, valid and new species described in the last 10 years for siluriformes according to the catalog of fishes database

ncbi: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/browser/wwwtax.cgi?id= <dig> and the catalog of fishes: http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/speciesbyfamily.asp, both accessed on march  <dig>  2017




this information gap on the genetic diversity of loricarioidei fishes is evident in studies of siluriformes  <cit>  and otophysi  <cit>  evolution. recently, in a time-calibrated mitogenome phylogeny of catfishes, the poor taxonomic representation of the loricarioidei suborder was hypothesized as the most probable cause for the paraphyletic arrangement of the callichthyidae and loricariidae families  <cit> . according to those authors, although this arrangement “does not represent a credible topology”, it “may have implications for the chronology of the basal siluriform nodes”  <cit> , and therefore, may impact studies on the historical biogeography of catfish dispersal throughout the globe.

the underrepresentation of loricarioidei genetic information deposited in public databases has also prevented a variety of studies about these species, from molecular ecology, biogeography and phylogeny to potential uses in aquaculture or as sentinels of environmental pollution. for instance, species delimitation and phylogenetic analysis of highly speciose genera such as hypostomus, peckoltia and corydoras could benefit from a larger volume of primary genetic resources. access to new gene sequences would stimulate work on the biogeography and speciation processes of loricarioidei fishes with wide distribution . likewise, the lack of genetic data is a key limitation preventing studies about the molecular ecology of those neotropical fishes.

herein, we focused on the loricariidae, the most species-rich family in the loricarioidei and the fifth most species-rich family among all vertebrates  <cit> . the nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences from  <dig> species of loricariidae and one of callichthyidae were generated, and their structural features were analyzed. additionally, the sequences of the  <dig> protein-coding genes and the two ribosomal rnas were used to test the currently accepted phylogenetic relationships among loricariidae subfamilies. these resources complement our recent efforts , augmenting from four to  <dig> the number of nearly complete mitochondrial genomes available for loricarioidei fishes.

coverage, annotation and depth
the new sequences covered from  <dig>  to  <dig> % the complete pterygoplichthys disjunctivus mitogenome , which was chosen as reference as it was one of the four complete mitogenomes of a loricarioidei species previously available on public databases, not sequenced by our group. the few nucleotide-long gaps verified in the assembled mitochondrial genomes were located at transfer rna  genes. despite these few gaps, the analysis of the sequenced mitogenomes, along with those available on genbank, made it possible to infer the mitochondrial gene composition and order for all species, which was found to be identical to the usual pattern for vertebrates .fig.  <dig> annotation and sequencing depth of the  <dig> newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes. annotation features are shown on the top of this figure as a linear representation generated by the mitos webserver  <cit> . in the upper panel, protein-coding genes are colored in red, ribosomal genes in green, and trna in blue. each trna is identified with the one-letter code for the corresponding amino acid. the sequencing depth of each position of the mitochondrial genomes is indicated below the general annotation. in the lower panel, color gradient corresponds to the number of reads supporting a given nucleotide, according to the legend at the right of the figure. illumina sequencing reads were aligned to the correspondent mitochondrial genome, using bowtie  <dig>  and counted on the integrative genome viewer   <cit> . representation of read counts as a color-gradient was generated using r. for comparative purposes, the recently released mitogenomes of h. incognitum, ancistrus sp.  <dig>  ancistrus sp. <dig> and c. nattereri were included




sequences of the two ribosomal rna  and the  <dig> protein-coding genes were obtained to their full length in most species. most genes are encoded on the heavy strand, whereas nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig>  and eight trna are found on the light strand . the majority of the  <dig> trna were completely sequenced in all species, except for hypostomus affinis . the complete sequence of the mitochondrial termination factor  binding site was obtained for  <dig> species, while partial sequence was obtained for  <dig> species. the mterf is located inside the trna-leu <dig>  justifying the highest frequency of partial sequences verified for this trna. nucleotide frequencies among species were similar . among the protein-coding genes, cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig>  had the highest percentage of invariable amino acids  and atpase subunit  <dig> , the lowest .

the origin of l-strand replication  was sequenced, except for loricariichthys castaneus and for hypostomus affinis, and was conserved in most species. the mitochondrial control region  was partially sequenced in all species, except schizolecis guntheri in which cr was not sequenced . the sequence length of the cr varied from zero in s. guntheri to  <dig> in k. heylandi, with a mean length of  <dig> nucleotides. the three cr domains  were found. the termination associated sequence  in the domain i was enriched with adenine  and thymine  nucleotides, and indels were found among the species. three conserved sequence blocks  were identified in domain ii.

csb-f was the most conserved among loricarioidei species . csb-e was conserved among  <dig> species, but diverged in species of the hemiancistrus, hypostomini and peckoltia-clades. while the 3′ end of csb-e is rich in at in the peckoltia-clade and in a in the hemiancistrus and hypostomini clades, it is rich in g in the other investigated species . a deletion of ~ <dig> nucleotides, starting with the seven nucleotides at the 3′ end of csb-d and spanning over other conserved blocks, follows the same phylogenetic trend . this deletion is supported by > <dig> reads in each of the species sequenced herein and by the previously deposited sequence of pterygoplichthys disjunctivus . at the same region, a six nucleotide-long insertion was noted in both species of rineloricaria . in most species, the t-homopolymer region was also found, which was followed by an at-rich segment that characterizes the third domain. csb- <dig>  csb- <dig> and csb- <dig> were fully sequenced and highly conserved among the analyzed genomes.fig.  <dig> long nucleotide deletion at the mitochondrial control region in species belonging to the hypostomini, hemiancistrus and peckoltia-clades. insertion/deletion mutations  are shown as hyphen . the position of the conserved sequence block d  is indicated at the left bottom. phylogenetic relationships among sequences are shown on the left. branches of the clade displaying the deletion are shown in black, while other are in gray. the names of each taxon are shown in fig. 3





sequencing depth is a direct reflection of mitochondrial transcript expression levels. minimum median sequencing depth was  <dig> found for parotocinclus maculicauda, while the maximum median depth was  <dig>  for loricaria cataphracta . the variation among species is regarded as minimal differences in the amount of sample submitted to high-throughput sequencing rather than biological. on the other hand, the variation among regions within a single mitogenome is biologically significant, follows the classical mitochondrial rna punctuation pattern and indicates the activity of a post-transcriptional gene expression mechanism. genes coding for the three mitochondrial subunits of cytochrome c oxidase were sequenced at the greatest depth, while short intergenic and trna sequences showed the lowest depth . heteroplasmic positions were found in all species, except one . the number of heteroplasmies varied from zero in neoplecostomini gen. n.  to  <dig> in loricariichthys castaneus, with median and average frequencies of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

annotation features
detailed annotation features of the  <dig> protein-coding genes of each species are summarized in additional file  <dig>  the protein-coding genes cytochrome c oxidase subunits  <dig> and  <dig> , nadh dehydrogenase subunits  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  4l and  <dig>  were found to be highly conserved, both in total length and nucleotide composition, among species of loricariidae and callichthyidae. cox <dig>  cox <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> genes were terminated with an incomplete stop codon , while a complete stop codon  was found in nad4l and nad <dig> of all species, except for hemipsilichthys nimius’ nad <dig> which is terminated by a tag. in kronichthys heylandi nad <dig> a gtg aligned to the atg start codon that is found in the other species. however, the codon immediately before this gtg is an atg. the other six protein-coding mitochondrial genes showed taxon-specific features that are addressed below.

the cytochrome b  gene has 1138 bp and uses an incomplete stop codon  in most species. however, a premature stop codon was found in all loricariinae species, as well as in the four ancistrinii clade species. this premature stop codon is produced by the change from tga to either taa or tag and aligns with the penultimate codon of the other sequences. within the context of the phylogenetic tree  the presence of this premature stop codon is most parsimoniously interpreted as independent synapomorphies supporting the monophyly of the loricariinae and ancistrini. this finding is supported by other cob sequences from loricariinae and ancistrinii species available at genbank, and can be interpreted as an example of convergent evolution.

the loricariidae species possess a 1551 bp long cox <dig> gene, as opposed to callichthyidae in which this gene consists of 1560 bp. the loricariidae and callichthyidae species sequenced herein use gtg as cox <dig> start codon. all loricariidae species use taa as a stop codon for this gene, except for two species, kronichthys heylandi and schizolecis guntheri, which use an incomplete stop codon . this exception cannot be confirmed in the literature as the nine cox <dig> genes sequences publicly available at genbank and the barcode of life data  systems for k. heylandi and the  <dig> for s. guntheri do not include the start or stop codons. callichthyidae species were found to use agg stop codon for cox <dig> termination.

the nad <dig> gene of the callichthyidae species and of hemipsilichthys nimius lack an amino acid at the sixth amino acid position, when aligned to the gene sequence of the remaining species. another amino acid-long gap, at the 257th amino acid position, was found to be exclusive of loricariinae representatives. in the case of loricaria cataphracta, however, this gap consists of two amino acids. among the hypostominae, ancistrus sp.  <dig> and ancistrus sp.  <dig> show an additional amino acid-long gap at the penultimate position. these might be phylogenetically informative characters for further studies of loricariinae and callichthyidae.

the nad <dig> is a small protein-coding gene encoded by 522 bp in the studied loricariidae, except for the five species of loricariinae and schizolecis guntheri. in these six exceptions, there is an amino acid-long gap at the 116th position. this gap is shared with the three corydoras species, which also present another gap at the position 142nd.

the gene atp <dig> is coded by 168 bp in all studied species, except for four of the five loricariinae species. in the two rineloricaria species and in the two loricarichthys species, an amino acid-long gap was found at the 40th position. as for the atpase subunit  <dig>  gene, hemipsilichthys nimius was the only species with gtg, instead of atg, as the start codon. all loricariidae species have the incomplete stop codon ta- to terminate the atp <dig> gene, while species of callichthyidae have the complete stop codon taa. corydoras spp.  share an apomorphic insertion between the atp <dig> and cox <dig> gene. in the newly sequenced c. schwartzi mitogenome, this insertion has  <dig> nucleotides.

inferred phylogeny of loricariidae subfamilies
sequences from the two ribosomal rna  and the  <dig> protein-coding mitochondrial genes were concatenated generating a super-alignment of  <dig> nucleotides, for each of the  <dig> loricariidae and three corydoras species, producing a fully resolved maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree , with branches showing high statistical support. the phylogenetic tree was rooted using sequences from corydoras schwartzi and two additional corydoras species obtained from genbank . hemipsilichthys nimius  appears as the sister taxon of the other loricariidae sub-families, except for lithogeninae . the remaining loricariids form three large clusters, corresponding to the subfamily loricariinae and a monophyletic group comprised by two clades: the subfamily hypostominae and a clade formed by neoplecostominae surrounded by hypoptopomatinae.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogeny of loricariidae subfamilies. the two ribosomal rna and  <dig> protein-coding genes  were aligned using muscle. bootstrap support values are shown on each node and are based on  <dig> replicates. callichthyidae species were used to root the tree. loricariidae subfamilies are highlighted in gray , yellow , green  and blue . the scale bar represents the nucleotide substitution rate, using the gtr + gamma + i model




notably, the retrieved phylogeny strongly supports the position of otothyrini, an hypoptopomatinae tribe, closer to neoplecostominae species, rather than to hypoptopomatini species, the other traditional hypoptopomatinae tribe. thus, hypoptopomatinae is considered monophyletic but, instead of two, it is composed by three tribes, hypoptopomatini, otothyrini and neoplescostomini. schizolecis guntheri is currently classified as a member of otothyrini, but appeared clustered closer to pareiorhaphis garbei and other members of neoplecostomini than to the other otothyrini.

it has been shown that for some lineages the phylogenetic tree topology retrieved using data from as few as three mitochondrial genes is the same as the topology retrieved using a concatenated alignment from the  <dig> protein-coding and the two rrna genes  <cit> . in order to evaluate this in neotropical catfishes, phylogenetic trees were generated using the three longest mitochondrial genes, which also harbor the majority of informative sites  and the three mitochondrial genes with the highest performance , as identified by havird & santos  <cit> . those trees did not recover the same topology as encountered in the tree recovered using information on the  <dig> mitochondrial genes . the position of loricaria cataphracta was distinct in the tree based on the three genes with the highest performance, and the position of dekeyseria amazonica was different in the tree based on the three longest genes .

pairwise nucleotide identity 
nucleotide identities between pairs of concatenated mitochondrial genes were calculated for every combination of the  <dig> taxa, arranged according to their phylogenetic relationships and colored as a heat-map for visualization . four islands displaying higher pairwise nucleotide identities than their surroundings were identified. not surprisingly, each of these islands is equivalent to major monophyletic clades. pairwise nucleotide identities  among congeneric species displayed a higher degree of similarity, ranging from  <dig> % between the two rineloricaria to  <dig> % between hypostomus sp. and h. cf. plecostomus. pni inside each island were most often above 85%, whereas nucleotide identity outside the islands but contained in the loricariidae realm was most often below 85%, ranging down to 80%. outside the loricariidae realm, nucleotide identity between any loricariidae species and any corydoras ranged from  <dig> to 80%.fig.  <dig> pairwise nucleotide identity among sequenced mitochondrial genomes. species are ordered according to the retrieved phylogeny on both axes. species names are shown on the left side, and their phylogenetic relationships are depicted at the bottom. the color gradient represents the percentage of nucleotide identity according to the legend at the right of the figure




discussion
mitochondrial genome structure
the structure of the newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes follows the general pattern described for ostariophysian fish  <cit> . among the identified differences, a ~ <dig> nucleotide-long deletion at the control region shared by baryancistrus xanthellus and species of hypostomini and peckoltia-clade highlights. in accordance with findings based on  <dig> ray-finned fish  <cit> , cox <dig> was the most conserved protein-coding gene in the mitochondrial genomes of loricarioidei species, while atp <dig> was the most variable. corroborating satoh et al.  <cit> , the mitochondrial termination factor  binding site found in the species used in this study was identical to the human sequence, implying functional conservation. the mterf binding site is located inside the trna-leu <dig> gene, which was the most frequent trna gene with partial sequence, corroborating the functional conservation.

the order of each gene in the mitogenome was inferred as the same as in other ostariophysian fish  <cit> , which is the typical for metazoans  <cit> . an intriguing difference is the disruption of the classical head-to-tail junction between atp <dig> and cox <dig> among corydoras species. a  <dig> nucleotide-long insertion was initially noted by saitoh et al.  <cit>  at the mitogenome of c. rabauti, but this trait was considered phylogenetically uninformative as it was not shared by any other species evaluated in that study  <cit> . subsequently, moreira et al.  <cit> , observed a homologous  <dig> nucleotide-long insertion in the mitogenome of c. nattereri and hypothesized this apomorphic trait as relevant for the phylogeny of this speciose genus. the  <dig> nucleotide-long insertion found in c. schwartzi corroborates and extends that hypothesis. although having the same length as in c. rabauti, these two  <dig> nucleotide-long insertions differ by six nucleotide substitutions .

the mitochondrial control region is composed by three domains  containing several conserved sequence blocks , each showing a taxon-specific distribution in vertebrates . recently, it has been demonstrated that csb-d and csb- <dig> are present in  <dig> fish species, although their functions are not yet clear  <cit> . while the newly generated mitochondrial genomes confirmed the presence of csb- <dig> within the loricarioidei, more than one-third of the csb-d was deleted in species of the hemiancistrus, hypostomini and peckoltia-clades. a complete csb-d was found in the other species, including the ones belonging to the subfamily ancistrini, which is closely related to those clades where the partial csb-d was identified. there are four monophyletic clades closer to the hemiancistrus, hypostomini and peckoltia-clades than to ancistrini  <cit> , suggesting that this partial csb-d deletion is a synapomorphy for a subset of hypostominae species. it will be elucidative to test the occurrence of this deletion in species belonging to these four clades. likewise, comparative studies using species in which csb-d is partially deleted and their closest relatives with complete csb-d might provide insights to the role played by this conserved sequence block in replication and transcription of the genome.

among the  <dig> fish species studied by satoh et al.  <cit> , three siluriformes species were used; two representatives of siluroidei and corydoras rabauti, a loricarioidei representative. the sequence of pterygoplichthys disjunctivus  corroborates this deletion in the csb-d, and although it was available since  <dig>  it was not included in the study of satoh et al.  <cit> . here, the mitochondrial genome of p. disjunctivus is used to confirm our findings, as it was obtained using a combination of long and short pcr from dna and sequenced using the sanger method  <cit> . additionally, this deletion is supported by the recently released mitochondrial genomes of hypancistrus zebra   <cit>  and pterygoplichthys anisitsi   <cit> .

mitochondrial gene expression
the variation found in the expression of mitochondrial genes is in accordance with the punctuation pattern, in which the polycistronic rna is cleaved at the trnas genes  <cit> . this pattern has been observed for other loricarioidei species , and suggests the fish mitochondria are transcribed as a polycistronic rna which is latter edited to monocistronic molecules and to two bicistronic rnas, coding for nad4/nad4l and atp8/atp <dig> 

the high sequencing depth also allowed for the detection of heteroplasmic sites in all species, except in neoplecostomini gen. n. , the species with the lowest count of mapped reads. on the other hand, loricariichthys castaneus was the species with the highest counts of both heteroplasmic sites and mapped reads . recently, we reported similar frequencies of heteroplasmic sites found in the mitogenome of other fish species  <cit> . mitochondrial heteroplasmies are associated with several health disorders in humans  and with insecticide resistance in insects  <cit> . however, the consequences of heteroplasmies on fish physiology, if any, are unknown.

phylogenetic analysis
our phylogenetic analysis gives strong statistical support for most of the recently published loricariidae phylogenies, including branches with poor bootstrap values  <cit> . specifically, our data corroborate previous studies on the positioning of neoplecostomini as a tribe embedded within the subfamily hypoptopomatinae. the mitochondrial genomic data also supports the positioning of neoplecostomini closer to otothyrini, with hypoptopomatini as the sister taxon of neoplecostomini and otothyrini, as proposed by roxo et al.  <cit> .


schizolecis guntheri was found to be a member of neoplecostomini rather than otothyrini, its current classification based on morphological traits and limited molecular evidence  <cit> . indeed, a sister-group relationship between s. guntheri and pareiorhaphis garbei was previously recovered by cramer et al.  <cit> , using a matrix of  <dig> nucleotides from partial sequences of one mitochondrial  and three nuclear genes . the s. guntheri and p. garbei specimens used by cramer et al.  <cit>  were sampled from the same population as in the present study. this finding is corroborated to some extend by the molecular identification of our specimens using the bold systems . according to the bold algorithm, our specimen of p. garbei appears in a small cluster composed by a few other p. garbei and unidentified neoplecostomus species, in a sister relationship to a larger s. guntheri clade, while our s. guntheri appears embedded among other s. guntheri specimens from other regions in brazil.

of note, the pairwise nucleotide identity  variation encountered among three genera of the peckoltia-clade  is below the range of variation encountered within each of the two genera in its sister clade , but above the variation between these genera . this is also valid if we include the recently described mitochondrial genome of hypancistrus zebra  <cit> , another member of the peckoltia-clade. however, the morphological diversity within the peckoltia-clade exceeds by far the variation found among hypostomini. although the hypostomini and peckoltia-clade are both species-rich, most hypostomini species are grouped into two large genera  while the peckoltia-clade is the most genus-rich loricariidae tribe  <cit>  and also harbors the worst taxonomic problems within this family  <cit> .

the low divergence found among the mitochondrial genomes from the four genera  belonging to the peckoltia-clade is a piece of information that shall assist in the explanation and resolution of these long standing taxonomic problems. in addition, an intriguing question emerges from our results: how is the tremendous eco-morphological diversity characteristic of the peckoltia-clade achieved with such a low genetic variation?

CONCLUSIONS
herein we have launched the use of high-throughput mitochondrial genomics in the studies of the loricarioidei species, advancing the knowledge on the genetic diversity of neotropical fish fauna. nearly complete mitochondrial genomes were sequenced for  <dig> species, representing  <dig> loricariidae and one callichthyidae genera. these new resources greatly reduce the underrepresentation of loricarioidei among the siluriformes mitochondrial genomes deposited in genbank and other public databases. however, the proportion of genetic data available for siluroidei still outpaces that of loricarioidei, especially with regard to nuclear genes.
