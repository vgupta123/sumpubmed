BACKGROUND
despite their relatively small size and apparent simplicity, double-stranded dna bacteriophages propagate by a tightly programmed infection process which involves a number of steps. adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell wall precedes injection of the nucleic acid and subsequent dna replication, eventually giving raise to new phage particles that are released after lysis of the host. muralytic enzymes play essential roles in the life cycle of phages by degrading the peptidoglycan  of the bacterial cell wall, facilitating the entry and eventual release of mature phage particles. many dna-tailed phages employ the holin-endolysin lysis system to release their progeny. holins usually form large pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of the host allowing the endolysin to gain access to and hydrolyze the pg layer  <cit> . in addition to endolysins which are synthesized at the late stage of the lytic cycle, virions often harbour murein hydrolases that locally degrade the pg in order to facilitate the entry of phage dna during infection. these virion proteins are responsible of the "lysis from without" phenomenon caused by some phages when adsorbed onto the host cell in very high numbers  <cit> .

virion-associated murein hydrolases appear to be widespread in bacteriophages infecting both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as shown by zymograms of fully assembled virions and homology analysis of sequenced phage/prophage genomes  <cit> . several phages infecting gram negative hosts contain hydrolytic activities at a variety of locations within the virions. a protein with n-acetylmuramidase activity is often anchored to the base plate structure, as in the t <dig> virion tail  <cit> . similarly, a lytic endopeptidase was found to be associated with the nucleocapsid of the double-stranded rna bacteriophage Φ <dig> infecting pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . in the t <dig> bacteriophage, gp <dig> is an internal head protein with transglycosylase activity that is ejected into the cell at the initiation of infection but is required only when the cell wall is highly cross-linked  <cit> .

the presence of muralytic activities in virions infecting gram-positive bacteria has also been demonstrated. pg hydrolase activities have been described in the virions for s. aureus phages Φ <dig> and Φ <dig>  <cit> , phimr <dig>  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit>  and in the lactococcus lactis phage tuc <dig>  <cit> .

s. aureus is an important human pathogen that has demonstrated a unique ability to acquire antibiotic resistance traits at high frequency and can cause numerous serious diseases  including food poisoning  <cit> . in the last few years, there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of community-associated methicillin- and multi-drug-resistant s. aureus infections that can limit therapeutic options  <cit> . therefore, there is a growing demand of new anti-staphylococcal agents.

in this context, attention has been paid to bacteriophage lytic enzymes such as endolysins and structural pg hydrolases. purified phage endolysins have been used as therapeutics  against streptococci in mice  <cit>  and have been proven effective against other gram-positive pathogens including enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium  <cit> , clostridium perfringens  <cit> , group b streptococci  <cit> , bacillus anthracis  <cit>  and s. aureus  <cit> .

previously, we reported the isolation of the s. aureus bacteriophage vb_saus-phiipla <dig>  belonging to the siphoviridae family  <cit> . the complete genome sequence was determined  and zymogram analysis revealed the presence of a phiipla <dig> virion-associated muralytic enzyme  <cit> . in this study, we describe the structural component of phiipla <dig> particle, hydh <dig>  which exhibits lytic activity against s. aureus cells. hydh <dig> contains a chap  <cit>  and a lyz <dig>  <cit>  domain and the contribution of each to cell lysis has been analysed. finally, we have determined the optimal activity conditions and heat-labile stability in order to assess hydh5's potential as an anti-staphylococcus agent.

RESULTS
s. aureus bacteriophage phiipla <dig> contains a structural component with a putative cell wall- degrading activity
the virions of phage phiipla <dig> possess a structural component with lytic activity as was previously shown by zymogram analysis  <cit> . this lytic activity corresponded in size to that expected for the protein product of orf <dig> , which is located in the morphogenetic module with most of the phage head and tail structural genes. computer-based similarity searches revealed that protein gp <dig>  designated here as hydh <dig> , showed 91% similarity with putative pg hydrolases identified in s. aureus phi <dig>  phinm and phimr <dig> phages . a 60% similarity was detected between hydh <dig> and the recently characterized pg hydrolase gp <dig> of s. aureus phimr <dig> phage  <cit> . a phylogeny tree was generated from alignment of the known staphylococcal pg hydrolases . the  <dig> different proteins were clustered into two major groups. no relation between these groups and the previous s. aureus phages classification based on their genome organization was observed  <cit> . interestingly, pg hydrolases from phages infecting s. epidermidis strains  were found to be very similar to those from s. aureus phages. furthermore, conserved-domain analyses of hydh <dig> identified two typical catalytic domains found in cell wall hydrolases. at its n-terminal region  a chap  domain was detected  <cit> . the c-terminal region  showed a lyz <dig>   <cit>  conserved domain. however, additional biochemical analyses of staphylococcal pg treated with hydh <dig> should be performed to determine the cleavage sites of each catalytic domain. the middle region of hydh <dig>  did not show homology to any conserved sequences. domain database and comparative sequence analysis failed to detect any known cell wall binding domain  in hydh <dig>  a schematic of the hydh <dig> protein is depicted graphically later in conjunction with deletion constructs .

predicted 3d structure of hydh5
the hhpred server and modeller program were jointly used to predict the structure of the hydh <dig> protein and three different domains were deduced. the predicted structure revealed similarity with the crystal structure of the e. coli gsp amidase  <cit>  belonging to the chap superfamily  <cit>  in the n-terminal region , with the staphylococcus epidermidis pg hydrolase amie  <cit>  in the middle region  and with the listeria monocytogenes pg hydrolase  <cit>  in the c-terminal region  . domain a  is predicted to have two α helices and four twisted anti- parallel β-sheets. two conserved catalytic residues are positioned in the first α helix termini and its neighboring β-sheet . a topology similar to these residues can be found in other members of this family of enzymes  <cit> . domain b  is comprised of two α helices and  <dig> parallel β-sheets between the helices. the topology of hydh <dig> catalytic residue pair is similar to the template structure but lacks any of the residues comprising the zinc binding site . domain c  has five predicted α helices. the conserved catalytic residue glutamine  <dig> was settled into the second α helix surrounded by three conserved aromatic residues, forming one side of the catalytic core . however, the other side of the catalytic core usually surrounding another acidic residue is not conserved. this acidic residue is usually positioned in a β-hairpin in the template structure  <cit> , while the structure of the corresponding region in hydh <dig> is predicted as a long coil rather than sheets. it is thus difficult to confidently predict where the non-conserved catalytic acidic residue settles into the predicted domain structure.

antimicrobial activity of pg hydrolase hydh <dig> and its catalytic domains
to confirm the predicted lytic activity encoded by orf <dig>  the complete gene and the regions encoding the two identified catalytic domains were amplified by pcr and individually cloned into the expression vector pet-duet <dig>  due to the high frequency of e. coli low usage codons in orf <dig> , hydh <dig> overproduction was performed in e. coli rosetta  pet-duet1-orf <dig>  which carries the plasmid prare containing trna genes for six rare codons in e. coli. truncated versions of hydh <dig> containing each of the individual catalytic domains chap and lyz <dig> were overproduced in e. coli bl21/plyss . attempts to purify the hydh <dig> and derivative proteins after induction of e. coli cultures gave low yields, presumably due to their low solubility. therefore, we proceeded to explore their recovery from inclusion bodies which were denatured and independently refolded in several buffers . the purity of the recombinant proteins in refolding buffer was at least 95% as assessed by sds-page analysis. the proteins migrate according to their calculated molecular masses plus the  <dig> × his tag  .

the pg hydrolytic ability of the different lysates and purified proteins were qualitatively assayed by zymogram analysis against s. aureus sa <dig> cells . both cell lysates and purified hydh <dig> showed lytic activity. however, lytic activity was only observed in the cell lysates of the catalytic domains, probably due to either a lower specific activity or a lower protein concentration of the purified truncated proteins. these results support the functionality of the putative pg hydrolytic domains found by the bioinformatic analysis. nevertheless, their activity seems to be somewhat weaker than that shown by other staphylococcal endolysins, e.g. lysk  <cit> , phi <dig>  <cit> , phimr <dig>  <cit>  because when classical turbidity reduction assays were performed, neither hydh <dig> nor its chap and lyz <dig> truncated derivatives were found to be active against s. aureus sa <dig> cells .

the antimicrobial activity of purified hydh <dig>  chap and lyz <dig> derivatives was quantified by the cfu reduction analysis.  <dig> μl of exponentially growing s. aureus sa <dig> cultures  were challenged to  <dig> μg of either the full-length or each truncated proteins . staphylococcal viability counts were reduced by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively, compared with the untreated controls. therefore, despite the fact that lysis was not detected in the zymograms with the truncated purified proteins both seemed to be active against s. aureus sa <dig> cells.

moreover, the susceptibility of s. aureus sa <dig> cells to hydh <dig> seems to be dependent on the growth stage. cells collected during the early and mid-exponential stages of growth were the most susceptible to the pg hydrolase hydh <dig> . by contrast, challenges using late exponential and stationary growth stages cells showed a reduction around 50% in hydh <dig> activity .

hydh <dig> catalytic domains have cell binding capacity themselves
the relative low lytic activity of the hydrolase hydh <dig> in vitro and the lack of a predicted cbd domain might suggest a poor capacity to bind to the cell wall. to assess the ability of full-length hydh <dig> and its truncated versions to target pg,  <dig> μg of each protein were added to exponentially growing s. aureus sa <dig> cells. as a positive control,  <dig> μg of the phiipla <dig> endolysin lysh <dig>  <cit>  was included. this protein harbours a sh3b cbd domain and specifically recognizes staphylococcal cells  <cit> . sds-page plus western blot analyses showed that all the 6× his tagged protein tested  were able to bind staphylococcal cells, since a interaction of these proteins with his-tag specific antibodies were detected when the washed cell pellets were loaded in the gels . the size marker confirms the expected size of the 6× his tagged proteins previously deduced from the sequence data and, thus, the observed shadow bands could be due to unspecific antibody binding . as hydh <dig> and its truncated derivatives bind cells under these experimental conditions, a cbd domain seems not be required for pg targeting.

hydh <dig> activity is inhibited by cations and is highly thermostable
the pg hydrolytic activity of hydh <dig> was further characterized at several salt concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> mm nacl, and in the presence of cations  at concentrations  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm . the highest activity was obtained at nacl concentrations lower than  <dig> mm. all the tested cations inhibited hydh <dig> activity even at the lowest concentration assayed.

to assess its thermal stability, hydh5's antimicrobial activity was tested and shown to be maintained at high temperatures  while lower temperatures decreased its activity . aliquots of hydh <dig> were also heated to 72°c or 100°c followed by cooling to allow refolding and the resultant activity tested at 37°c for  <dig> min against s. aureus sa <dig> cells . hydh <dig> was not inactivated completely by any of the tested temperature/time combinations. hydh <dig> activity was detected even after the strongest heat treatment . in this case, a 72% of activity was observed compared to the untreated control.

discussion
to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, new strategies are being explored. in this context, the effectiveness of phage-encoded endolysins to eliminate certain infections has been well documented in mouse models  <cit> . the main advantage of these proteins is their ability to kill bacteria with near-species specificity and the reported low incidence of resistance development  <cit> . similarly, other phage lytic proteins that also hydrolyze essential pg bonds such as structural pg hydrolases, may also contribute to the supply of new antimicrobials.

preliminary sequence analyses of the virion-associated pg hydrolase hydh <dig> revealed two putative lytic domains, namely, n-terminal chap domain and lyz <dig> domain at the c-terminus. this protein organization resembles that of other phage muralytic enzymes which, similar to endolysins, appear to be modular enzymes containing separate catalytic domains. it has been proposed that the evolution of endolysins, and probably also structural pg hydrolases, has likely occurred through domain swapping and that phage lytic enzymes have co-evolved with host autolysins  <cit> . in fact, the predicted 3d structure of hydh <dig> identified another central domain with remote homology to the amie catalytic domain of the autolysins atle and atla, the major s. epidermidis and s. aureus autolysins, respectively. however, key residue changes seem to have been selected in the active site of hydh <dig> despite the maintenance of the amidase-like fold, likely rendering a reduced activity amidase domain  <cit> . whether or not these mutations have catalytically inactivated the amie domain remains to be determined.

it should be noted that lyz <dig> domains have been rarely studied in phages, being the phage phimr <dig> the only example reported so far  <cit> . however, it has been predicted that this lysozyme subfamily  <dig> catalytic domain  is widely distributed in staphylococcus phage, staphylococcus bacteria and other related bacteria.

in this work, we have demonstrated the staphylolytic activity of full-length hydh <dig> and each of its two catalytic domains by both zymogram analysis and cfu reduction analysis. having two active catalytic domains decreases the likelihood of resistance development to this antimicrobial in that the pathogen would potentially need two simultaneous mutations in the same cell to become resistant. this is a very attractive trait for potential antimicrobials. further biochemical analyses are required to definitively assign the endopeptidase and lysozyme activities to these domains and confirm to what extent both contribute to the lytic activity identified in our assays. it has been previously shown that some individual endolysin catalytic domains can lyse s. aureus cells in the absence of the complete protein. for example, phi <dig> and lysk endolysins have active chap domain constructs without either the amidase or sh3b domains required  <cit> .

our results also indicated that the lytic activity of hydh <dig> and the two catalytic domains does not require a cbd. bioinformatic analysis of hydh <dig> failed to detect a known cbd. it has been speculated that some endolysins possess catalytic domains operating as cell wall-binding domains that direct the protein to target epitopes on the surface of susceptible bacteria  <cit> . there are also numerous reports of c-terminally deleted lysins where the n-terminal lytic domain maintains their staphylococcal-  <cit>  or streptococcal-specificity  <cit>  in the absence of their cbd. more surprising are recent studies showing that the lytic activity of the b <dig>  and plygbs  <cit>  lysins were maintained or even enhanced, approximately 25-fold, respectively, in engineered lysins in which the sh <dig> domain has been removed. however, it is not entirely clear which part of the protein determines the specificity. based on the results that showed binding of the catalytic domains to cells, we hypothesized that substrate recognition in hydh <dig> might be somehow mediated by its catalytic domains. however, further analyses are required to demonstrate the specificity of this binding for s. aureus cells. in this regard, preliminary results about the hydh <dig> lytic spectrum indicated that most of tested staphylococcal strains were susceptible to this protein . it should be kept in mind that, in contrast to endolysins, phage structural pg hydrolases might not require a cbd because they are delivered to the pg substrate by the virion particle structure  <cit> .

the proposed function of phage structural pg hydrolases during the first steps of the phage life cycle also implies that their hydrolytic activity should only damage the cell wall slightly in order to avoid premature lysis of the host cell. for this reason, it is not surprising that the lytic activity of hydh <dig> and both truncated versions were not detected in turbidity reduction assays but were capable of killing s. aureus sa <dig> cells in the cfu reduction analysis. the variable quantitative behaviour of pg hydrolases activities in different lytic assays has also been observed by other authors  <cit> . the killing activity of hydh <dig> was inhibited by some cations and sodium chloride. although most of the endolysins described so far has not been tested for the effect of cations, there are some which lytic activity is dependent on or enhanced in the presence of calcium in the assay buffer  <cit> .

the highest protein activity was detected against actively dividing log phase growth staphylococcal cells, possibly due to a different conformation of the pg. in fact, the degree of peptidoglycan cross-linking is significantly increased in stationary phase cells of species such as e. coli and bacillus spp.  <cit> .  a similar result was observed with the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> structural transglycosylase which facilitated infection of e. coli cells growing to high cell densities or low temperatures. in these conditions the murein is more highly cross-linked and the internalization of the phage genome is significantly delayed in absence of gp <dig> protein  <cit> . different susceptibility as a function of growth stage was also observed in the ply <dig> endolysin  <cit> , which is more active against early and mid-exponential streptococcus uberis cells.

another feature that is characteristic of hydh <dig> and other phage structural hydrolases is their thermostability, most likely related to a high refolding capability. hydh <dig> retained 72% of its activity after a 5-min treatment at 100°c. likewise, the structural lysozyme from phage phikmv infecting ps. aeruginosa is also a highly thermostable protein, retaining 26% of its activity after  <dig> h at 100°c and 21% after autoclaving  <cit> . by contrast, the lytic activity of most phage endolysins is destroyed by heat treatment  <cit> . this makes structural pg hydrolases attractive antimicrobials to be used in combination with other hygienic procedures based on high temperature such as those applied in food preservation and as structural models for highly thermostable enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
the lytic activity of hydh <dig>  the virion-associated pg hydrolase from phage phiipla <dig>  is due to the presence of two active catalytic domains, namely, an n-terminal chap domain and a c-terminal lyz <dig> domain. hydh <dig> lysed s. aureus cells in the absence of divalent cations and this activity was optimal against early exponential cells and at 45°c. these characteristics along with its thermostability provide it a potential to be applied as antimicrobial against s. aureus.
