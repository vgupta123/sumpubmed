BACKGROUND
strong anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> -dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  have been demonstrated in a wide spectrum of solid cancers, in vitro and in animal models  <cit> . a link between  <dig> d status and cancer has also been demonstrated in epidemiological studies. together these data lead to a number of clinical trials to test the efficacy of  <dig> d or synthetic analogs  <cit> . yet, the molecular mechanisms by which the  <dig> d pathway exerts its anti-proliferative effects remain unclear. there is much need for detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanism behind the anti-proliferative action of  <dig> d, since calcemic side-effects form a major obstacle for the development of  <dig> d or derivative drugs. classically,  <dig> d mediates the maintenance of calcium homeostasis through activation of the vitamin d receptor , a ligand dependent transcription factor. the  <dig> d-vdr receptor-ligand complex functions by interacting with vitamin d response elements  present in the promoter region of responsive genes. while many known vdre-containing genes contribute to calcium regulation , others are involved in cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis   <cit> . alternative, non-genomic pathways have been suggested to explain the anti-proliferative action of  <dig> d. for example a membrane bound vdr was proposed  <cit>  and other forms of signaling outside the nucleus  <cit> .

in previous years, several mcf <dig> cell lines have been generated of which proliferation is not affected by  <dig> d. their  <dig> d resistance was introduced by long time low dose or increasing dose of  <dig> d  <cit> . notably, even when cultured in the absence of  <dig> d these cell lines still persist to proliferate whenever exposed to  <dig> d. this makes it reasonable to assume that the alterations that led to the resistance need to be genetically fixed . we therefore hypothesized that genome wide screens could potentially identify these genetic changes in the absence of vitamin d. in this study we thus utilized genome wide approaches to identify these stable alterations.

our understanding that stable changes exist in these cell lines which underlie their response to  <dig> d, prompted us to avoid the use of  <dig> d. to perform this genomics study in the presence of  <dig> d would identify the massive number of  <dig> d downstream genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle. indeed, there are various examples in the literature where  <dig> d has been used resulting in the identification of such genes  <cit> . although causative/driver genes may have been identified in these studies, they would be difficult to pinpoint within the massive amount of proliferative genes. thus, omission of  <dig> d in our genomic screens could potentially identify the causative/driver alterations that cause resistance in our model, whilst omitting the detection of downstream proliferative genes. prior to these experiments we performed vdr knockdown experiments to study the role of this receptor in  <dig> d anti-proliferation effect.

these experiments suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d can either be dissociated or only require extremely low levels of the vdr in mcf <dig>  in addition we found that structural changes on chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig>  may be involved in  <dig> d resistance of mcf <dig> 

methods
biological material
four mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines and their  <dig> d resistant counterparts were obtained and designated, mcf7wt1-mcf <dig> vdr <cit> , mcf7wt2-mcf <dig> dr, mcf7wt2-mcf <dig> dra and mcf7wt3-mcf <dig> d3res  <cit> . the mcf <dig> vdr resistant line was obtained by exposure to increasing amounts of  <dig> d , whereas mcf <dig> dr, mcf <dig> dra and mcf <dig> d3res were exposed to maximal concentrations of  <dig> nm  <dig> d for up to  <dig> months. all cell lines were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium , supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm glutamine,  <dig> u/l penicillin and  <dig> u/l streptomycin and were cultured at 37°c in a humid atmosphere consisting of 5% co <dig> and 95% air. cell proliferation was measured by the 3-- <dig> -diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide  assay  <cit>   in the presence of  <dig> d  <dig> nm or vehicle for  <dig> h.

vdr knockdown by sirna
knockdown of vdr expression was performed on all three separate parental mcf <dig> cell lines as biological triplicates using the silencer® validated sirna id  <dig> according to the manufacturer's protocols . a 21-nucleotide probe , directed against a sequence in exon  <dig> of the human vdr gene , was transfected into all three mcf <dig> parental cell lines using the siport™ amine transfection agent . transfection optimization and efficiency was measured using the kdalert gapdh assay kit , which measures gapdh sirna-induced gene knockdown at the protein level. the efficiency level obtained was within the levels described and according to the manufacturer. the conditions used for optimal silencing were:  <dig>  cells/well in 24-well plates,  <dig> nm of dsrna and  <dig> μl of the transfection agent. a negative sirna  with no significant homology to any known gene sequence was used as a control. transient transfections were performed for  <dig> h in the absence/presence of  <dig> nm  <dig> d. after this period, the efficacy of vdr knockdown was assessed by q-pcr  and proliferation by mtt assays.

gene
western blot and antibodies
protein lysates were made of cells at approximately 70-80% confluency. cells were washed twice with pbs, lysed on ice , vortexed and clarified by centrifugation at  <dig> × rpm for  <dig> min at 4°c. protein concentration was determined using dc protein assay . a total of  <dig> μg of total protein lysates were analyzed by 8% sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a amersham hybond ecl nitrocellulose membrane , using a trans-blot sd semi-dry transfer cell . membranes were probed with the antibodies against vdr  and α-tubulin . quenching and immunostaining of the blots was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. detection was done using amersham ecl western blotting detection reagents . immunoblots were performed at least three times, and representative figures are shown. the biorad quantity one 1-d analysis software  was used to quantify the band intensities.

nucleic acid extractions
cell lines were cultured in  <dig> cm <dig> flasks to 70-80% confluency and harvested using  <dig> ml/ <dig> cm <dig> of trizol reagent . both rna and dna were extracted with trizol reagent according to the manufacturers' protocols. nucleic acids were quantified using a nanodrop nd- <dig>  and quality was visually confirmed by gel electrophoresis.

microarray experiments
arrays and data acquisition
for expression, nmd and cgh arrays hybridizations were performed onto slides containing 60-mer oligonucleotides representing  <dig> unique genes based on the human release  <dig>  oligonucleotide library as designed by compugen , and obtained from sigma-genosys  <cit> . following hybridization using a hybarray  <dig>  the slides were scanned with a microarray scanner g2505b . spot analysis and quality control were fully automated using bluefuse version  <dig>   and spots with quality flag < <dig> or confidence value <  <dig>  were excluded from further analysis. original data files for all arrays can be found in geo .

expression microarrays and analysis
a total of  <dig> microarray expression experiments were carried out, with four biological replicates and  <dig> technical replicates including dye swaps. cdna probes were generated from  <dig> μg of total rna, and experiments performed as previously described  <cit> . after scanning and data acquisition, genes with spots flagged in more than one array were excluded for further analysis. for the remaining genes, the value of a flagged spot was imputed using k nearest neighbors' imputation as implemented in the r-package "impute". curvature in the ma plots was limited but nevertheless normalized using lowess as implemented in the r-package "maanova"  <cit> . using an analysis of variance  model, "dye", "hybridization date" and "sample" were specified as factors together with the factor of interest, "treatment" . maanova was used to perform anova for all genes. permutations were applied to the sample labels and uncorrected pooled p-values from the f-statistics were computed for the treatment effect. fdr corrected p-values were computed to adjust for multiple testing. panther classification system was used to statistically determine over- or under- representation of pathways http://www.pantherdb.org/ <cit> .

nonsense mediated decay arrays  and analysis
cells were incubated with the drug emetine , which inhibits the nmd pathway, hereby blocking the degradation of non-sense mrnas  <cit> . approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> cells at 70%-80% confluence were treated with  <dig> μg/ml emetine for  <dig> hours  <cit> . following incubation with emetine, cells were directly lyzed by the addition of trizol  omitting any treatment with actinomycin d. in total four hybridizations were performed , one for each of the paired  emetine treated cell lines. for this reason the inclusion of a control experiments consisting of "normal" keratinocytes as suggested  <cit>  was unnecessary and therefore omitted in the study. after scanning and data acquisition, spots flagged were excluded for further analysis and a distribution curve was built with the log <dig> ratios for the remaining genes. in typical conditions a normal distribution of the ratios is expected. by blocking the degradation of nonsense mrnas an accumulation of genes with mutations is expected, which can be measured by a "skew" in the "normal" distribution plot towards the positive side.

array comparative genomic hybridization  and analysis
cgh arrays were performed as previously described  <cit> . dna from resistant and sensitive cell lines were differentially labeled and co-hybridized. for interpretation and visualization purposes, smoothing was performed using "acgh-smooth"  <cit> , with lambda set to  <dig> . smoothed log <dig> ratios of - <dig>  and  <dig>  were used as thresholds to define gains and losses.

quantitative pcr  confirmation of sirna and expression arrays
gene expression was technically confirmed by q-pcr using sybr green chemistry. non-redundant primers were designed and are listed in table  <dig>  primer pairs were checked for linear response over a range of cdna input and for nonspecific targets with dissociation curves. total rna  was reverse-transcribed to cdna according to the manufacturer's instructions  and subsequently used in the amplification with  <dig> μm gene specific primers and  <dig>  μl of 2× sybr green master mix  in a total reaction volume of  <dig> μl. reactions were carried out using standard cycle parameters on an abi prism sequence  <dig> detection system . relative transcript levels were determined using gapdh as an internal reference. statistically significant differences between resistant and sensitive cell lines were determined using comparative delta-delta ct test  <cit> . all reactions were done in triplicate and expressed as mean of the values from three separate experiments.

in silico analysis of array cgh profiles from solid breast tumors
publicly available array cgh datasets were analyzed for the presence of alterations in the region 11q <dig> - <dig> . a total of four datasets corresponding to  <dig> individual profiles were screened  <cit> . the datasets were obtained from publicly available databases  and the journal website . the  <dig> profiles included  <dig> breast tumors and  <dig> breast tumor cell lines. the cghcall package  <cit>  was used to identify alterations in the  <dig>  mb region at chromosome  <dig> 

RESULTS
proliferation in  <dig> d resistant and sensitive mcf <dig> cell lines
vdr is essential for regulation of calcium homeostasis by  <dig> d, but its role in the anti-tumor effects mediated by vitamin d signaling remains unclear. therefore, the objectives of these studies were first, to determine whether vdr knockdown would alter the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d, and second, to identify genomic changes in stable  <dig> d resistant cell lines. studies were conducted with several mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines previously selected for  <dig> d resistance by independent laboratories  <cit> . we first confirmed the effects of  <dig> d on growth of the three parental mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines and the four variants selected for  <dig> d resistance . in the presence of  <dig> nm  <dig> d, proliferation was reduced approximately 50% in all parental mcf <dig> cell lines, according to the mtt assay. in contrast,  <dig> d had no effect on proliferation in the resistant mcf <dig> cell lines. these data are in agreement with previous observations independently reported on these cell lines  <cit> .

effect of vdr knockdown on  <dig> d mediated proliferation inhibition
since vdr is pivotal in calcium metabolism we first tested whether vdr expression is correlated with proliferation and  <dig> d sensitivity. for that reason, mcf <dig> cell lines were transfected with either a specific vdr-sirna or a non-specific sirna. the transfection in combination with the mtt proliferation assay allowed us to assess the effect of  <dig> d on cells with reduced vdr expression. surprisingly, parental mcf <dig> cells transfected with vdr-sirna were growth inhibited by  <dig> nm  <dig> d to the same magnitude as cells transfected with negative sirna . the degree of vdr knockdown by the vdr-sirna was assessed in these cells at both the mrna and protein level. by q-pcr, a strong reduction of vdr transcripts was observed , and a comparable decrease in vdr protein expression was detected on western blots for vdr . furthermore, we used q-pcr to confirm that the vdr effector gene cyp24a <dig> was downregulated. in cells expressing negative sirna,  <dig> nm  <dig> d strongly  induced cyp24a <dig> expression whereas in cells expressing vdr-sirna this induction of cyp24a <dig> expression by  <dig> d was not observed . besides being a downstream effector gene containing a vdre, cyp24a <dig> is an important component of the  <dig> d calcium metabolism pathway. our data thus demonstrate that decreased vdr and cyp24a <dig> expression do not affect cellular sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d. while unexpected, these data may indicate that a very low level of vdr expression is sufficient to trigger  <dig> d mediated growth inhibition. alternatively,  <dig> d may mediate growth regulation in mcf <dig> cells via non-genomic processes  <cit> .

identification of differential gene expression between  <dig> d resistant and sensitive mcf <dig> cell lines
the sirna results described above indicate that reduction of vdr expression did not necessarily de-sensitize cells to the anti-proliferative action of  <dig> d. consistent with the concept that vdr signaling can be dissociated from growth regulation, mcf <dig> cells selected for resistance to  <dig> d retain vdr expression and function  <cit> . to assess the molecular mechanism that is involved in dictating cellular resistance to  <dig> d, we performed genome wide analysis at the rna and dna level with these  <dig> d resistant and sensitive mcf <dig> cell lines. these studies were performed in the absence of  <dig> d in order to identify driver/causative alterations rather than  <dig> d downstream genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle as described in the introduction. rna isolated from all four  <dig> d resistant cell lines was hybridized directly to their sensitive mcf <dig> counterparts. both technical as well as biological replicates were combined in the analysis . using maanova,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  were differently expressed in  <dig> d resistant mcf <dig> cells compared to the parental lines . the introduction of a lowess normalization step had little to no impact on the overall results. when ranking the most significant differently expressed genes with respect to their log <dig> ratios, it was observed that no single gene was highly differentially expressed in relation to  <dig> d resistance of all four cell lines. instead, many genes had small increases or decreases in expression . the differential expression of key genes was technically validated and confirmed by q-pcr , i. e. genes up-regulated in the array experiments are up-regulated in the q-pcr, vice versa for down-regulated genes. genes that were uniformly down regulated in the  <dig> d resistant sub-lines included fam14a, a poorly characterized interferon inducible gene; phlda <dig>  a pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein involved in apoptosis; and cyp24a <dig>  which codes for an enzyme that catabolizes  <dig> d. up-regulated genes included slitrk <dig> an integral membrane protein generally expressed in neuronal cells; ddit <dig>  a stress response gene that initiates apoptosis; and cyfip <dig>  a gene involved in a redundant network of genes responsible for p53-dependent apoptosis. down regulation of cyp24a <dig> in the resistant cell lines was surprising, as up-regulation of this gene has been linked to  <dig> d resistance  <cit>  and cyp24a <dig> was found to be amplified in various human tumors, including breast  <cit> . consistent with previous reports  <cit> , the vdr itself was not identified as differentially expressed in the resistant cell lines by these expression arrays. because vdr was flagged in the array analysis due to low expression, we used q-pcr analysis to confirm that vdr expression was not differentially expressed between resistant and sensitive cell lines.

vdr signaling pathway is not identified by expression arrays on the  <dig> d resistant cell lines
since neither vdr nor cyp24a <dig> were implicated in the  <dig> d resistance of these mcf <dig> cell lines, we examined whether other genes involved in the vitamin d pathway, or alternative signaling pathways, might be involved. to test this, we used pathway analysis to determine if the set of  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the sensitive and resistant cell lines was enriched for genes serving particular pathways. screening more than  <dig> pathways in panther, six were found to be significantly altered in the  <dig> d resistant cell lines relative to their parental counterparts. notably, the vdr signaling pathway was not identified by this approach. instead, five of the six identified pathways corresponded to membrane receptor signaling pathways involved in the cellular response to extracellular signals : egf, pdgf, fgf, interleukins and toll receptor pathways. this analysis also identified differential expression of genes in the b cell activation pathway in association with  <dig> d resistance. interestingly, these six signaling pathways were over-represented in the  <dig> d resistant cell lines, and all are involved in the control of proliferation, cell growth and apoptosis. the specific genes in these pathways that were altered between sensitive and resistant cell lines are listed in table  <dig>  additional experiments are needed to assess the involvement of these pathways in dictating cellular sensitivity to  <dig> d.

nonsense mutations were not identified in  <dig> d resistant cell lines
nonsense mediated decay  analysis was performed to identify genes that might have undergone mutational events related to the  <dig> d resistance phenotype. resistant and sensitive cell lines were treated with emetine to block degradation of nonsense rnas. hybridizations were performed of resistant vs. sensitive emetine treated cell lines such that all  <dig> biological replicates were hybridized on a total of  <dig> arrays. the results indicated that no genes were recurrent in the biological replicates. in addition, the top positive log <dig> ratio was similar to the top negative log <dig> ratio. visualization of all log <dig> ratios further revealed a normal distribution of the data around zero with no gene that stood out to the positive side of the curve. thus, overall this data did not support the concept that the  <dig> d resistant cell lines shared one or more common mutated genes.

resistant cell lines exhibit copy number reduction of chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig> 
chromosomal copy number aberrations  affect the properties of a cancer in a  type specific manner  <cit> . using array cgh, a variety of cnas, including gains, losses and high level amplifications on multiple chromosomes were identified in mcf <dig> cell lines  <cit> . these chromosomal changes can occur spontaneously during in vitro culture or in response to environmental factors such as drugs  <cit> . therefore, in the current study we were interested to determine whether in vitro selection for  <dig> d resistance induced recurrent chromosomal alterations in mcf <dig> cells. to monitor chromosomal aberrations array cgh was performed. direct hybridization of dna from sensitive and resistant cell lines yielded primarily flat profiles, with few regions showing copy number alteration. as a control, the separate channels of these dual channel cgh arrays were interchanged using a common reference  to verify the original mcf <dig> profiles  <cit> . of those regions that were altered between sensitive and resistant cell lines, 76% showed reduction in copy number, but only one region was commonly altered in all four  <dig> d resistant cell lines and none of the parental counterparts . the altered region varied in size with the smallest region of overlap  of  <dig>  mb and ranges from 11q <dig>  to 11q <dig> . the region contains  <dig> known genes  <cit> , none of which are known to be involved in the vitamin d signaling pathway. we hypothesized that if loss of vitamin d responsiveness contributes to human malignancies, alterations in chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig>  might also be frequent in solid tumors. publicly available array cgh datasets were used to screen for alterations at 11q <dig>  to 11q <dig>  in breast tumors. this in silico analysis showed that  <dig> % of the breast tumors and 41% of the breast tumor cell lines exhibited alterations in this particular region of chromosome  <dig> 

discussion
the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d are poorly understood, despite the well known role of  <dig> d in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. in this study we show that the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d may be functional in mcf <dig> breast tumor cell lines, without a role for the central player in calcium homeostasis, vdr. these results were unanticipated since several known regulators of cell growth, such as p <dig> and gadd45a, contain functional vdres in their promoter region and are induced by the  <dig> d-vdr complex in cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, cell lines derived from vdr knockout  mice are resistant to  <dig> d mediated growth arrest  <cit> , and re-introduction of vdr into these cells restores sensitivity to  <dig> d mediated growth inhibition . while additional studies are needed to determine whether residual vdr activity in the mcf <dig> cells expressing vdr-sirna is sufficient to mediate growth inhibitory signals upon binding  <dig> d, our data demonstrates that marked reductions  in vdr do not necessarily induce  <dig> d resistance. seemingly contradictive to the role of vdr, this finding is consistent with previous data from mcf <dig> sub-lines selected in vitro for resistance to  <dig> d, in which vdr function is retained  <cit> , indicating dissociation between vdr expression and  <dig> d mediated growth inhibition.

in the light of these results, we hypothesized that driver/causative genes other than vdr, or alternative pathways unrelated to vitamin d calcium signaling might impact  <dig> d sensitivity or replace its function. therefore we used genome wide screens to identify genetic alterations that cause resistance in our model. indeed, in all four  <dig> d resistant cell lines one common chromosomal region had reduced copy number at 11q <dig> - <dig>  . eighty genes are present in this  <dig>  mb chromosomal region, none of which could readily be assigned to  <dig> d mediated vdr signaling. in focally aberrant regions  identification of driver genes is often straight forward, but it is our experience  <cit> , acknowledged by others  <cit>  that identification of candidate genes in larger chromosomal regions is problematic. one effort made was integration with our expression array data which did not proof helpful; hence pathway analysis of genes in this region would be arbitrary. other authors performed similar array experiments in the presence of  <dig> d, yet again none of the  <dig> genes in this region was identified  <cit> . our expression array analysis confirmed that  <dig> d resistant cells did not exhibit significant reductions in vdr gene expression. still, as described previously the vdr-transcriptome may be significantly altered  <cit> . indeed, these authors showed that cyp24a <dig> was the only induced gene that was common to the genetic profiles of the parental and the  <dig> d resistant cell lines when treated with  <dig> d treated  <cit> . in contrast, our expression array analysis identified cyp24a <dig> as one of the top five down-regulated genes in the  <dig> d resistant mcf <dig> cell lines. since cyp24a <dig> is strongly regulated by  <dig> d in a negative feed-back, but no  <dig> d was present in our test, any discussion on this apparent down-regulation remains speculative.

pathway analysis of the expression arrays did not identify any other known vitamin d pathway genes either. instead, over-representation of multiple membrane receptor signaling pathways known to be involved in the control of proliferation and apoptosis were associated with the  <dig> d resistant phenotype. the five membrane-bound receptor signaling pathways identified in our analysis share the grb <dig> and sos genes and drive cell proliferation. interestingly, previous analysis of one set of these sub-lines indicated that, in the absence of  <dig> d, the doubling time of the mcf <dig> d3res cells was shorter than that of the mcf <dig> sensitive cells from which they were derived  <cit> . furthermore, using proteomic approaches we previously identified several proteins in the mapk-erk-ras mitogenic pathway that were differentially expressed in the mcf <dig> d3res cells relative to their sensitive mcf <dig> counterparts under basal conditions  <cit> . although mechanisms have yet to be clarified, chronic up-regulation of these mitogenic pathways may selectively disable vdr signaling, leading to  <dig> d resistance. in support of this idea, ras activation has been shown to induce  <dig> d resistance in keratinocytes via direct phosphorylation of vdr  <cit> .

in a previous study we used the same genome wide tools to identify the mechanisms of gemcitabine resistance  <cit> . results were simple and straightforward to interpret; gemcitabine had selected for tumor cells with high level amplifications, leading to high expression levels of genes within that amplicon which resulted in drug resistance  <cit> . here a similar simple mechanism for  <dig> d resistance was not identified. a possible explanation may be that most therapeutic drugs  are synthetic and  <dig> d is generated endogenously. consequently, malignant cells would need to develop resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of  <dig> d in a very early stage of their development to allow tumor expansion. accordingly, we hypothesized that many solid tumors would also contain alterations at 11q <dig> - <dig> . indeed, screening of four datasets covering  <dig> individual array cgh profiles showed that the region in chromosome 11q <dig> - <dig>  is highly unstable strengthening this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
evidence accumulates demonstrating an important role for vitamin d not only in the treatment but also in the prevention of cancer, mainly breast cancer. dozens of vitamin d analogues have been developed by pharmaceutical firms with the goal of dissociating the potentially toxic calcemic actions of  <dig> d from its anti-tumor actions for use in cancer therapy. because vitamin d analogs are currently in approximately  <dig> clinical trials  <cit> , understanding the mechanisms by which  <dig> d mediates growth inhibition, as well as the basis for development of  <dig> d resistance, is crucial. our genome wide screening analysis has identified chromosomal regions, membrane receptor pathways and new candidate genes outside of the classical vdr signaling pathway that may be associated with  <dig> d resistance. these data provide new avenues for future explorations that may facilitate the development and use of vitamin d based drugs for cancer and other clinical applications.
