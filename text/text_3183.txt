BACKGROUND
cellulosic ethanol production from renewable biomass including lignocellulosic materials and agricultural residues is a promising alternative to fossil oil as transportation energy  <cit> . increased ethanol titer or concentration of microbial fermentation has been considered as a strategy to reduce energy cost in downstream distillation and waste treatment  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae is a traditional ethanol producer, yet it is sensitive to high concentrations of ethanol. ethanol diffuses freely across biological membranes in yeast cells allowing equalization of ethanol concentrations between intracellular and extracellular pools. as a result, the increased ethanol concentration in a medium inhibits cell growth, damages cell viability, and reduces ethanol yield  <cit> . using ethanol tolerant strains for high ethanol yield fermentation is desirable for cost-efficient ethanol production. however, mechanisms of ethanol tolerance are not well known and ethanol-tolerant yeast is not readily available.

more than  <dig> genes have been identified involving ethanol tolerance by high throughput assays  <cit> . most genes are related to heat shock protein genes  <cit> , trehalose biosynthesis and amino acid pathways  <cit> , fatty acid and ergosterol  <cit> . while a significant amount of gene expression data was obtained over the past decade, a lack of solid characterization of expression dynamics exists. for example, studies using snapshot methods were common and often lower concentrations of ethanol were applied at late stages of cell growth . when a serial of samples were taken over time, there is usually no additional ethanol challenge applied. as a result, it is very difficult to avoid biased assessment for the complex interactions of ethanol tolerance in yeast.

yeast tolerance to ethanol is complex involving multiple genes and multiple quantitative trait loci  <cit> . development of ethanol-tolerant strains has been hindered by using conventional genetic engineering methods. on the other hand, yeast is adaptable to stress conditions under directed evolutionary engineering  <cit> . adaptation and evolutionary engineering have been successfully applied in obtaining ethanol tolerant strains at varied levels  <cit> . previously, we developed tolerant ethanologenic yeast s. cerevisiae nrrl y- <dig> that is able to withstand and in situ detoxify numerous fermentation inhibitors that are derived from lignocellulose-to-ethanol conversion such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural   <cit> . building upon the inhibitor-tolerant yeast, we recently developed ethanol-tolerant yeast nrrl y- <dig> using an adaptation evolutionary engineering method under laboratory settings.

the qrt-pcr is an accurate assay platform and considered as an assay of choice for quantitative gene expression analysis. it is commonly used to confirm high throughput expression data obtained by microarray which has higher levels of variations from multiple sources. for absolute quantitative gene expression analysis, due to the necessary wells required for the construction of standard curves, very limited number of wells are available for target gene assays  <cit> . recently, a significant advance has been made to safeguard data accuracy and reproducibility with two new components, a robust mrna serving as pcr cycle threshold reference and a master equation of standard curves  <cit> . these developments allow unification of expression data from different experimental conditions for comparative analyses. this method and other similar approaches have been rigorously examined with demonstrated advantages of reliability and reproducibility over housekeeping genes  <cit> .

in the present study, we compared cell growth, cell viability, ethanol production and gene expression under the ethanol stress between two very closely related strains, the lignocellulosic inhibitor-tolerant y- <dig> and its ethanol-tolerant derivative y- <dig> retaining the inhibitor-tolerance characteristics. using the recently developed pathway-based qrt-pcr array assays, we investigated transcription dynamics of over  <dig> selected genes based on previous reports and our preliminary screening in response to ethanol challenge using a time-course study. the objective of this study was to identify candidate and key genes responsible for ethanol tolerance to support complete ethanol fermentation. our results uncovered previously unreported genes accountable for ethanol tolerance and identified legitimate candidate genes of ethanol tolerance based on the ethanol-tolerant y- <dig>  results of this study will aid dissection of ethanol tolerance mechanisms in yeast and metabolic engineering efforts for more tolerant strain development.

RESULTS
tolerance and viability
on a solid medium of 2% glucose containing 8% ethanol, ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig> showed cell growth from reduced cell concentrations at 10- to 100-fold dilutions . in contrast, cells of y- <dig> failed to grow at any reduced cell concentration levels. strain y- <dig>  an ethanol-tolerant derivative from its parental y- <dig>  maintained the inhibitor-tolerance and able to in situ detoxify furfural and hmf derived from pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. on a medium of 2% glucose containing furfural and hmf at  <dig> mm each, both strains showed similar growth patterns against the inhibitors at all cell dilution levels from 10- to 1000-fold . on a liquid ym of 2% glucose containing furfural and hmf, both strains showed similar growth pattern and reached stationary phase in  <dig> h 

on a liquid ym of 10% glucose containing 8% ethanol, the ethanol-tolerant y- <dig> displayed a nearly normal growth and reached stationary phase  <dig> h after incubation . for its parental strain y- <dig>  cell mass was low and cell growth appeared ceased after  <dig> h. when cell viability was tested using solid ym of 2% glucose inoculated with the cell cultures at different time point, the parental strain y- <dig> showed a very poor growth response at  <dig> h and no viable cell growth was observed at any later time points . on the other hand, the ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig> displayed a normal growth for samples taken at  <dig> h till  <dig> h after the ethanol challenge. reduced cell growth and cell lyses were observed for samples taken at  <dig> to  <dig> h after ethanol challenge when the fermentation was completed for several days.

glucose consumption and ethanol production
with the addition of ethanol at 8%   <dig> h after inoculation, yeast growth of the two strains showed a similar od reading briefly followed by an obvious separation after  <dig> h between the ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig> and its parental strain y- <dig>  strain y- <dig> exhibited a continued growth through a log phase in  <dig> h to reach an od <dig> reading of  <dig>  when the ethanol concentration was  <dig>  g/l  . on the other hand, y- <dig> ceased growth since  <dig> h and apparently went into cell lysis stages and never recovered. consequently, no glucose consumption and ethanol conversion were observed for y- <dig> under the ethanol challenge . in contrast, the ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig> displayed an accelerated glucose consumption and ethanol conversion after  <dig> h . at  <dig> h, glucose was almost exhausted and the total ethanol concentration reached  <dig> g/l. production of glycerol and acetic acid under the conditions of this study was insignificant .

master equation for qrt-pcr assays
using cab as a sole reference to set a manual threshold at  <dig> ct for data acquisition   <cit> , raw data were normalized and analyzed for the entire pcr reactions applied in  <dig> individual 96-well plate runs. as anticipated, extremely high levels of consistent performance was obtained for the universal control genes as a calibration standard . a standard curve was constructed for all individual plate reactions applying the universal control genes msg, cab, rbs <dig>  and actb . a highly fitted master equation was established  using the pooled data for all reference control reactions as follows:   

where x represents mrna  and y equals qrt-pcr cycle number  estimated for all reactions performed on an abi  <dig> real time pcr system. average pcr amplification efficiency for the entire reaction set was 95%  as measured by the slope of the standard curves  <cit> .

enriched background of gene transcription abundance
for ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig>  initial mrna abundance of many genes showed significant difference without ethanol challenges compared with its parental strain y- <dig> under the same growth conditions. at the designated  <dig> h, a time point the culture was incubated for  <dig> h before the ethanol addition, at least  <dig> genes were found having higher gene transcription abundance for the ethanol-tolerant yeast than its parental strain . in this group,  <dig> were first identified as ethanol tolerance related genes as follows: elo <dig>  gup <dig>  hsp <dig>  pgm <dig>  pfk <dig>  pda <dig>  lpd <dig>  irc <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  zwf <dig>  sol <dig>  gnd <dig>  prs <dig>  pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  yor <dig>  snq <dig>  ict <dig>  ddi <dig>  tpo <dig>  gre <dig>  ydr248c, and ymr102c . since the higher levels of transcripts were acquired through the tolerant adaptation procedures, these genes are considered as ethanol-tolerance related. they belong to groups of heat shock proteins, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid metabolism and the pdr gene family. the increased abundance for many genes was significantly higher in y- <dig> as compared with its parental strain y- <dig>  especially for those in pdr gene family such as pdr <dig>  yor <dig>  snq <dig>  and gre <dig>

transcription dynamics of heat shock protein genes
all  <dig> examined heat shock protein genes demonstrated normal or enhanced expressions at the earlier stage, such as at  <dig> or  <dig> h after ethanol challenge for both strains . however, most heat shock protein genes in y- <dig> were repressed at  <dig> and  <dig> h and only three genes, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  remained induced for the parental strain y- <dig>  but the expression abundance of these genes was significantly less than that of the ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig> . y- <dig>  on the other hand, had  <dig> genes, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and hsp <dig> showing significantly induced expressions from  <dig> to  <dig> h. among these, hsp <dig> displayed the highest expression levels at all time points. except for hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  all other heat shock protein genes of y- <dig> had distinct increased expression dynamics over time compared with its parental strain y- <dig> . for example, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in y- <dig> were highly expressed at each time point. these heat shock proteins were found to be involved in cellular structure-function relationships at multiple locations including nucleus, mitochondrion, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, membrane, and cell wall .

adaptive expressions of trehalose and glucose metabolism genes
although the initial transcription abundance was low, all examined trehalose and glycogen metabolism genes responded positively to the ethanol challenge over time. transcription levels of the  <dig> trehalose metabolism genes in y- <dig> were consistently enhanced from  <dig> to  <dig> h, especially for nth <dig>  nth <dig>  ath <dig>  tsl <dig>  tps <dig>  gph <dig>  and gsy <dig> . gph <dig>  a gene involved in glycogen catabolism had almost 20-fold increased transcription abundance, the highest level in this group at  <dig> h for the tolerant y- <dig>  its expression levels were significantly greater at every time point compared with those of the parental strain . gsy <dig> encoding for udp-glucose-starch glucosyltransferase, another highly induced expressed gene in y- <dig>  was identified as a new candidate gene for ethanol tolerance. for the parental strain y- <dig>  most genes in this group had similar induced response at  <dig> and  <dig> h after the ethanol challenge. however, except for gph <dig>  all other  <dig> genes were reversed as repressed after  <dig> h.

transcription dynamic response was more complex for genes involving in glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. many genes in this group demonstrated persistent high abundant expressions from  <dig> to  <dig> h after the ethanol challenge such as pgm <dig>  hxk <dig>  glk <dig>  tdh <dig>  gpm <dig>  irc <dig>  ald <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  sfa <dig>  sol <dig>  gnd <dig>  nqm <dig>  and ydr248c . especially for gnd <dig>  tdh <dig> and nqm <dig>  their expression levels were constantly higher at all time points. the expression patterns of most genes in this group in y- <dig> were distinct from that of its parental strain y- <dig>  particularly after  <dig> h when many genes of the latter were significantly repressed. in addition to genes with enriched transcriptional abundance, at least another seven previously unreported genes in this group were identified as new candidate genes for ethanol-tolerance and ethanol production under the stress including adh <dig>  sfa <dig>  gnd <dig>  nqm <dig>  sol <dig>  irc <dig>  and ydr248c .

many important genes in this group displayed a normal or non induced expressions under the ethanol challenge for the tolerant y- <dig> such as pgi <dig>  pfk <dig>  fba <dig>  tdh <dig>  tdh <dig>  tpi <dig>  pgk <dig>  gpm <dig>  eno <dig>  ebo <dig>  err <dig>  err <dig>  pyk <dig>  cdc <dig>  pdc <dig>  pdc <dig>  aro <dig>  thi <dig>  ald <dig>  ald <dig>  adh <dig>  pda <dig>  pdb <dig>  acs <dig>  sol <dig>  sol <dig>  tkl <dig>  and tkl <dig> . in contrast, for the parental y- <dig>  most of these genes were repressed at the lower levels especially after  <dig> h . the transcript of zwf <dig> in y- <dig> was not only enriched initially, but constantly displayed greater levels of expression at every time point compared with its parental y- <dig> . some enhanced genes in the tolerant y- <dig> are involved in multiple functions of carbohydrate metabolism and mitochondrion functions such as hxk <dig>  glk <dig>  gnd <dig>  tdh <dig>  sol <dig>  gpm <dig>  adh <dig>  and ald <dig> .

enhanced expressions of pdr gene family
seventeen genes in this group were selected based on our preliminary tests of yeast stress tolerance. among which,  <dig> genes were identified as candidate genes closely related to ethanol tolerance by enriched background of transcription abundance, increased, normal or recoverable expressions under ethanol challenge as demonstrated by the tolerant y- <dig> . pdr <dig>  ddi <dig>  tpo <dig>  and gre <dig> maintained noticeable higher levels of expressions at all time points in addition to their enriched mrna abundance at  <dig> h for y- <dig>  other genes in this group such as pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  ymr102c, pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  pdr <dig>  yor <dig>  and snq <dig> for y- <dig> were expressed at normal levels or recoverable at later stages. on the other hand, these genes in y- <dig> were repressed.

comparative expressions of transcription factor genes
in addition to the pdr <dig> and pdr <dig> expressions representing pdr1p and pdr3p described above, four other genes encoding transcription factors msn4p, msn2p, yap1p and hsf1p showed distinct expression patterns over time between the two strains. expression levels of these four genes in y- <dig> were constantly reduced with the time exposed to ethanol . for the tolerant y- <dig>  msn <dig>  yap <dig> and hsf <dig> represented a similar type of expressions that was moderately repressed at  <dig> and  <dig> h after exposure to ethanol . at  <dig> h, their expression levels were remarkably increased and significantly greater in y- <dig> than those in y- <dig>  at  <dig>  although significantly higher than the parental strain, transcription levels of these three genes in y- <dig> decreased. msn <dig>  on the other hand, displayed a unique type of continued increase of up-regulated expressions from  <dig> to  <dig> h. at the critical time point of  <dig> h, unlike the other three repressed genes, msn <dig> expression in y- <dig> was consistently increased from the previous time point, significantly higher than the parental control . this consistent increase of transcription abundance was distinct and observed at  <dig> h again for msn <dig> in y- <dig> 

transcriptional regulation under ethanol stress
most members of pdr gene family were found to have protein binding motifs of transcription factor pdr1p/pdr3p in their promoter regions . significantly up-regulated pdr <dig>  tpo <dig>  gre <dig> and ymr102c had at least two binding motifs. several genes in other functional categories also shared the pdr1p/pdr3p binding site. the number of protein binding motifs of transcription factors msn4p/msn2p, yap1p and hsf1p for the ethanol tolerance candidate genes was remarkably large. among  <dig> candidate genes of ethanol tolerance identified in this study,  <dig> genes were found to have a protein binding motif of msn4p/msn2p, yap1p or hsf1p; and  <dig> genes shared the common binding sequence for all of the three transcription factors . the four newly identified ethanol-tolerant candidate genes hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and gnd <dig> by this study were found to share the same transcription factor msn4p/msn2p. gnd <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> also appeared co-regulated by hsf1p, and gnd <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  by yap1p.

expression responses of other genes
expression levels of gene transcripts involved in fatty acid metabolism were generally low and repressed for both strains in response to the ethanol challenge except for elo <dig>  etr <dig>  phs <dig>  tsc <dig>  oar <dig>  and htd <dig> in y- <dig> having induced or recoverable expressions . similarly, most genes in ergosterol metabolism group were repressed but erg <dig>  erg <dig> and erg <dig> in tolerant y- <dig> appeared to have normal or recoverable transcription expression potential over time . while all five tryptophan biosynthesis genes in parental y- <dig> were repressed over time, trp <dig> in the tolerant y- <dig> was able to withhold the ethanol challenge . other four genes were mostly less repressed in y- <dig> than in y- <dig> . among five proline biosynthesis genes, put <dig> was induced for both strains. expression patterns of most glycerol metabolism genes under ethanol challenge were similar for both strains with a few exceptions of y- <dig> genes including dak <dig>  gcy <dig>  gpd <dig>  gup <dig>  and gup <dig> 

discussion
applying a newly developed qrt-pcr array assays to unify gene expression data analysis, we demonstrated transcription expression dynamics for ethanol-tolerant mutant y- <dig> in response to ethanol challenge compared with its parental strain y- <dig> of s. cerevisiae. as opposed to a single "snapshot" observations, we used a more informative time-course design investigating selected gene expression response from initial , early growth , exponential/log phase , and entering stationary phase  relative to the cell growth stage under the ethanol challenge. the dynamics of gene expression over time closely correlated with metabolic profiles and cell growth phenotypes between the two strains. this allowed identification of at least  <dig> candidate and key genes for ethanol tolerance and subsequent ethanol fermentation under the ethanol stress. among which,  <dig> genes were the first report by the present study. our results also suggest a potential key regulatory role of msn4p for ethanol-tolerance among other transcription factor and regulatory elements.

the newly developed data acquisition and analysis standard for qrt-pcr array assays using the robust mrna as the pcr ct reference provided reliable means to safeguard data fidelity and allowed unification of gene expression data for comparable analysis. housekeeping genes are commonly used as quality controls for qrt-pcr but vary under different experimental conditions  <cit> . among numerous systems developed  <cit> , the universal rna controls have been shown another successful applications under ethanol stress conditions in this study. an extended adaptation and applications of such methods for consistent quantitative gene expression analyses are expected in the future.

genes associated with ethanol stress were mostly reported based on snapshots of gene expression response in yeast  <cit> . in this study, we investigated a time-course study comparing cell growth, viability, glucose-to-ethanol conversion, and gene expression dynamics for two closely related strains. this allowed assessment of phenotype associations and identification of legitimate candidate genes for ethanol tolerance. as demonstrated by this study, the parental strain showed briefly induced expression of numerous genes before becoming repressed and unable to establish a viable culture under the ethanol challenge. uncovered by the expression dynamics of the tolerant strain, we are able to distinguish ethanol-tolerance candidate genes and tolerance-response from the transient stress-response in yeast. for example, unlike many heat shock protein genes in parental strain becoming repressed after  <dig> h, these genes in the tolerant y- <dig> showed continued inductions through  <dig> h. this indicated that the continued expression of those heat shock protein genes after  <dig> h is critical for the ethanol tolerance in yeast.

heat shock proteins, mainly act as chaperones, insuring properly folding or refolding of nascent or denatured proteins and enzymes to maintain functional conformation  <cit> . for example, hsp12p, hsp26p, hsp42p, hsp78p, and hsp82p were reported to prevent proteins from aggregating, and hsp104p was able to disassemble protein aggregates that have accumulated in response to stress  <cit> . hsp <dig>  a highly up-regulated gene in response to ethanol for the ethanol tolerant y- <dig> observed in our study, was reported to activate many key cellular regulatory and signaling proteins, such as transcription factors and regulatory kinases  <cit> . the lack of continued function of these genes and interactions with other relevant gene expression in y- <dig> led to no further metabolic functions. recent proteomic studies suggested that mrna is selectively processed and translated in stationary phase  <cit> . our results of enhanced expressions of most heat shock protein genes at a relatively late stage such as  <dig> and  <dig> h, for the tolerant y- <dig> are supportive to this hypothesis.

in this study, we found three previously unreported heat shock protein genes, hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  were highly enhanced in the tolerant y- <dig> and identified as candidate genes for the ethanol tolerance. hsp31p and hsp32p, functioning as a chaperone and cysteine protease, are involved in protein binding, peptidase and hydrolase activities. significantly enhanced gene expressions of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> in y- <dig> observed in this study suggests the potential involvement of hsp31p and hsp32p as chaperones against ethanol stress. in addition, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> were found to have functions in cell component and biological process categories. hsp150p is a protein involved in cell wall and structural molecule activity. higher levels of transcription and continued expressions of hsp <dig> indicated its potential protective functions compared with its parental strain under the ethanol challenge. many heat shock protein genes induced by ethanol stress are present in cytoplasm as well as in nucleus and mitochondrion  <cit> . because up-regulated heat shock protein genes influence cell functions at multiple locations, this facilitates the functions of transcription factors in nucleus, improving atp energy generation in metabolic processes, maintaining enzyme functions involving biosynthesis, catabolism, and ethanol production in cytoplasm.

the induced gene expressions related to trehalose and glycogen metabolism are expected to facilitate a stable intracellular environment under ethanol stress condition for survival and accelerated glucose metabolism. we found gsy <dig>  a gene involved in glycogen biosynthesis and degradation was up-regulated over time as a new record. since glycogen metabolism is very close to trehalose pathway, the two pathways likely affect each other. storage carbohydrates such as trehalose are compatible solutes that can prevent cell dehydration and influx of excess salts into cells. trehalose accumulation was observed under ethanol stress condition to reduce membrane permeability and proper folding of proteins  <cit> . our findings of up-regulated tps <dig>  tsl <dig>  pgm <dig>  and ugp <dig> in this group were consistent with previously observed. genes involved in trehalose degradation including nth <dig>  nth <dig>  and ath <dig> were also induced by ethanol. these observations also agreed with previously reported  <cit> . enhanced expression of trehalose degrading genes appeared to be necessary in order to balance trehalose concentration and energy required for cell functions  <cit> .

as demonstrated in this study, rapid cell growth and highly integrated expression of genes involved in trehalose biosynthesis, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway were closely correlated for the ethanol-tolerant strain y- <dig>  continued enhanced expressions of many genes associated in these groups apparently contributed active energy metabolism . in addition, numerous genes able to maintain normal expressions in y- <dig> appeared to be important keeping gene interactive networks. these genes are necessary for the tolerant yeast to carry out the active metabolisms and complete the ethanol fermentation  while most of these genes were repressed for the parental strain y- <dig>  the ethanol-tolerant y- <dig> was co-selected for inhibitor-tolerance derived from its parental y- <dig>  under the ethanol challenge, the ethanol-tolerant y- <dig> displayed tolerant gene expression dynamics leading to similar route of pathway activities especially in every cofactor regeneration step. cofactor nadph plays an important role in biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides  <cit> . under the ethanol stress condition described in this study, the glucose metabolic pathways also appeared having a well-maintained cofactor redox balance  as exampled for gnd <dig> and zwf <dig> in oxidative phase of pentose phosphate pathway, ald <dig> in acetic acid production, and gcy <dig> in glycerol metabolism. enhanced expression of zwf <dig>  sol <dig>  and ydr248c potentially provide sufficient substrate for a smooth pentose phosphate pathway flow. therefore, sufficient nadph supply likely contributes ethanol tolerance indirectly through efficient biosynthesis of amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides for cell growth and function. similarly, tdh <dig> involved in nadh regeneration step was highly induced. the enhanced expressions of alcohol dehydrogenase genes adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  adh <dig>  and sfa <dig>  together with other normally expressed genes in the intermediate steps of glycolysis, are critical to complete the fermentation.

for the above mentioned reasons, we consider tryptophan and proline synthesis genes trp <dig>  pro <dig>  and put <dig> as ethanol tolerance candidate genes. our results support the involvement of these genes in ethanol-tolerance as suggested by previous studies  <cit> . several genes involving in fatty acid metabolism were repressed except for etr <dig>  elo <dig> and htd <dig> having induced and normal expressions for the tolerant y- <dig>  ergosterol is another major component of cellular membranes that associated with maintenance of plasma membrane fluidity affecting ethanol tolerance  <cit> . similarly with previous reported  <cit> , most genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis were repressed for both strains in this study. it is possible that the regulatory functions of the biosynthesis may not be significantly affected at transcriptional levels under the conditions of this study.

the pdr gene group is a new set of genes examined for ethanol tolerance in this study. many pdr genes function as transporters of atp-binding cassette proteins and are encoded for plasma membrane proteins that mediate membrane translocation of ions and a wide range of substrates. it impacts lipid and cell wall compositions and major facilitator superfamily proteins for cell detoxifications  <cit> . we previously found that pdr genes and regulatory elements played significant roles for tolerance and in situ detoxification of lignocellulose-derived inhibitors  <cit> . since plasma membrane and cell walls are major targets of ethanol damages, we anticipated the involvement of these genes for reconditioning and remodeling membrane and cell walls in response to ethanol challenges. the significantly enriched background of transcriptional abundance and continuously increased expressions of several genes in this group for the ethanol tolerant yeast observed in this study support our hypothesis .

the expressions of pdr genes are mainly controlled by transcription factor pdr1p and pdr3p  <cit> . as demonstrated in our study, many genes share the common transcription protein binding motif of pdr1p/pdr3p. expressions of pdr <dig> in the tolerant y- <dig> was not significantly induced but constantly expressed at all time points compared with the parental strain. it needs to be pointed out that unless it is repressed, pdr <dig> does not have to be greatly induced to allow potential pdr1p functions as a regulator  <cit> . we consider the ability of its expression under the stress is a tolerance response and suggest pdr1p as a potential regulator involving the ethanol tolerance of y- <dig>  as discussed above, genes able to express or recover to express normally under the stress are important to maintain gene interactions and cell functions. on the other hand, transcription factor genes msn <dig>  msn <dig>  yap <dig> and hsf <dig> of the tolerant strains were highly abundance under the ethanol stress. since many ethanol tolerance candidate genes sharing protein binding motifs of msn4p/msn2p, yap1p and hsf1p, these transcription factors are likely a core set of regulators for interactive expressions of ethanol tolerance. an hsf1-deletion mutant showed repressed expressions for its target genes usually induced by ethanol  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that msn2p and msn4p induces gene expression via a stress response element and triggers transcriptional response of the downstream genes  <cit> . condition-specific roles in gene expression regulation by these transcription factors were also suggested  <cit> . msn2p has been confirmed for its positive regulatory function of hsp <dig> and most heat shock protein genes for increased ethanol tolerance  <cit> . a double gene deletion msn2msn4-mutant showed hypersensitivity to environmental stress including higher ethanol concentrations  <cit> . we demonstrated that the increased expressions patterns of msn <dig> overtime were distinct from other transcription factor genes. our results suggest a potential key role of msn4p in the dynamic response to the ethanol tolerance. however, limited information is available for msn4p and further studies on its regulatory roles for tolerance are needed.

CONCLUSIONS
the qrt-pcr array assay equipped with the robust mrna reference and the master equation is an efficient means for quantitative gene expression analysis which unifies a large amount of expression data generated under different experimental conditions. the comparative characterizations of adaptive transcription dynamics for the two closely related strains are more informative and provide insight into dissection of mechanisms of ethanol tolerance. analysis of the expression dynamics and association of other phenotypes allowed identification of candidate and key genes for the ethanol-tolerance and ethanol production under the stress. enriched background of mrna abundance of many genes appeared to be inheritable for the ethanol-tolerant yeast. most ethanol-tolerance candidate genes were found sharing protein binding motifs of transcription factors msn4p/msn2p, yap1p, hsf1p and pdr1p. the unique expression pattern of msn <dig> in the ethanol-tolerant y- <dig> suggested a potential key regulatory role of msn4p during the adaptive expression in yeast. unlike repressed in the parental strain, genes able to maintain normal expressions under the ethanol-stress were necessary for the tolerant y- <dig> to function. ethanol-tolerance candidate genes identified in this study are primarily associated with functional categories of cytoplasm, membrane, cell wall, response to stress, transportot, protein folding, oxidoreductase activity, protein binding and unknowns classified by gene ontology . however, multiple functions and functions at multiple loci of many candidate genes are common. ethanol induced genes are involved in at least  <dig> go categories and every gene was found to have more than one function  <cit> . it's the time to revisit the traditional "one gene-one function" concept when evaluating gene regulatory networks. the complicated gene interactions cannot be overlooked in dissection of mechanisms of ethanol-tolerance in yeast.
