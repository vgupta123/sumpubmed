BACKGROUND
the bronchial epithelium has been shown not only to serve as physicochemical barrier to inhaled chemical or physical substances and infectious agents but also to be involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases in humans and animals. for example, airway epithelial cells play a pivotal role in the patho-mechanisms of human asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases   <cit>  and inherited disease such as cystic fibrosis  <cit> . they initiate and augment the innate immunity by forming and releasing pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators that can alter cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and activation of immune cells  <cit> . thus, in standard animal models of asthma such as in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs airway epithelial cells have been considered as pathological and therapeutic targets of airway diseases.

among large animal models, horses show naturally occurring airway disease i.e. recurrent airway obstruction , also known as "heaves", displaying many of the hallmark features of allergic airway disease in humans  <cit> . as large animal models, horses would offer a wider scope for repeated sampling and measures of airway function and unlike human studies allow for greater control and study in the onset, progression and resolution of experimental equine, and presumably human, airway diseases  <cit> . therefore, establishing and characterizing an equine bronchial epithelial cell  culture system can provide the opportunity to investigate more closely the possible contribution of epithelial cell biology to rao in horses.

despite several attempts of isolating and culturing horse airway epithelial cells  <cit> , their role in the pathogenesis of rao has not been investigated. this was presumably hampered because the culture conditions did not fully resemble the in vivo conditions in terms of differentiation and polarization; properties that are observed only when these cells are cultured under air-liquid-interface  conditions  <cit> . current reports on culturing equine bronchial epithelial cells merely described how to get confluent cultures on solid supports in serum-free medium, but the degree of cell differentiation which limits their use for in vitro studies was not evaluated  <cit> . the only study attempting to establish ali-cultures in serum-free medium  <cit>  did not characterize the state of ebec differentiation and polarization using measurements for trans-epithelial resistance , tight junction expression, and cell-type specific expression of cytokeratins, all markers of differentiation resembling in vivo airway epithelial conditions. it is known that tight junctions are characteristic features of differentiated airway epithelia and determine epithelial barrier as well as cell growth and differentiation.

extensive effort has been made to establish such methods of isolation and culture of human and other laboratory animal airway epithelial cells that reliably result in cellular differentiation and polarization. culturing primary and passaged airway epithelial cells on semi-permeable membrane supports under ali conditions has been proven to facilitate the development of muco-ciliary and pseudo-stratified morphology  <cit> . variability in airway epithelial cell differentiation in ali cultures depends on whether freshly isolated and pre-cultured  cells were seeded. other factors include the use of serum-free, hormone and growth factors supplemented airway epithelial cell growth medium  or dmem/ham's f- <dig> medium supplemented with serum-like substituent such as ultroser g  <cit> . in some studies, gene expression and basic cellular function of such ali cultures were shown to resemble those found in vivo in intact bronchial epithelium  <cit> .

the objective of the present study was to establish and extensively optimize ebec isolation and culture conditions to generate cell differentiation with important prerequisites to resemble the airway in vivo epithelium. primary  and passaged  ebecs from the same horse were grown and differentiated on solid supports or membrane inserts under ali condition in serum-supplemented or -deficient aecgm. the level of differentiation and polarization was characterized by light and phase-contrast microscopy, standard histological staining, immunocytochemistry, scanning electron microscopy , and by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance .

RESULTS
growth and differentiation of ebecs under conventional culture conditions
successful dissociation of epithelial cells was confirmed by h&e staining after short-term  incubation of native bronchial tissues with  <dig> % trypsin-edta solution . a mean yield of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> viable cells was obtained from  <dig> mg minced tissue, with viability of > 95% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion test . freshly dissociated cells often consisted of single or clumped and rotating ciliated cells.  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of these cells were ck5/6/18-positive indicating epithelial origin while only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  vim-positive suggesting non-epithelial cell origin .  <dig> cells were counted in at least three randomly selected fields.

when cells were seeded at a density of  <dig> × 105/cm <dig> on collagen-coated flasks,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  of ebecs could attach after  <dig> h in serum-containing and serum-free aecgm, respectively. we have tested fcs at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> % but were not able to reproducibly generate healthy cultures under lli or ali conditions; therefore, we decided to focus on using 10% fcs that showed optimal growth. this suggests that 10% serum leads to a reduction in cell attachment efficiency. serum also affected cell morphology and growth pattern . ebecs cultured in serum-free medium showed distinct polygonal shape with clear margins and typically formed lines and chains while spreading over the growth surface . cells grown in serum-containing aecgm had more compact growth pattern and a marked tendency for cell-cell-contacts, as indicated by the presence of fine cytoplasmic bridges connecting single cells as well as the boundaries of cell colonies . moreover, these colonies formed large coherent sheets with poorly defined margins between single cells and acquired distinct and typical epithelial polygonal shape but only in confluent areas. addition of serum initially stimulated faster proliferation compared to cultures in serum-free aecgm. however, cells cultured in the presence or absence of serum required similar median days  to reach 80-100%  confluence.

after cultures reached complete confluence, no apparent morphological differences were observed among cells grown with or without serum. in both types of media, confluent monolayers formed typical epithelial mosaic-like or cobblestone appearance , with 100% ck-5/6/18-positive cells  and no detectable signal for vim . however, immuncytochemical staining for the tight junction protein zo- <dig> showed different patterns: cells grown in serum-free aecgm showed only spot-like cytoplasmic immunopositive green signal , while cells grown in serum-containing aecgm showed continuous immunopositive signal .

in addition to the observed formation of tight junctions, ebec cultures in serum containing aecgm exhibited also more typical features of differentiation . many pas-positive cells   as well as many ciliated cells were routinely detected , even  <dig> h after plating and during the whole culture period . in contrast, in serum-free aecgm, ebecs completely lacked visible cilia and showed less intense pas-positivity .

when primary  ebecs were sub-cultured at a density of  <dig> × 105/cm <dig> on collagen-coated plastic supports, passage was possible for up to p <dig>  compared to p <dig> cultures, the p <dig> and p <dig> cultures usually required more than  <dig> d to reach 80-100% confluence in both serum-free and serum-containing media. however, subculture was more successful when cells were grown in serum-free aecgm. markers of differentiation, i.e. pas-positive and ciliated cells were significantly reduced in p <dig> cultures, and ciliated cells were completely absent in p <dig> cultures regardless of serum.

growth and bioelectrical properties of p <dig> and p <dig> ebec ali-cultures
p <dig> and p <dig> cells obtained from  <dig> different horses were used for establishing cultures on collagen-coated membrane inserts under ali conditions. interestingly, when these cells were seeded and maintained under submerged condition  in serum-free aecgm, they failed to proliferate and effectively develop tight junctions. moreover, teer measurements were not different from basal resistance measured in cell-free inserts. in contrast, when serum-containing aecgm was used in liquid-liquid- and ali conditions, both p <dig> and p <dig> cultures formed tight junctions and cells were polarized and differentiated into a pseudo-stratified and mucociliary epithelium.

p <dig> insert cultures were successfully established from all  <dig> horses, although marked inter-individual variations could be observed. the data from one horse differed largely from the others and, thus, was excluded. under liquid-liquid-interface  condition, cells at p <dig> showed a high rate of proliferation and usually formed confluent layers within 3- <dig> d post-seeding. teer increased rapidly and in a time-dependent manner and reached mean values of  <dig>  Ω·cm <dig>  at confluence . when cultures were switched to ali conditions , teer decreased abruptly to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  between d  <dig> and  <dig>  in three cultures, which had teer values ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Ω·cm <dig> , the switch to ali induced pronounced decrease in teer . the decrease in teer values was accompanied with partial retraction of the cell layer forming holes and at later time points with retraction of the entire cell layer at the periphery. nevertheless, recovery of these alterations was seen starting from d 4- <dig> of ali, during which cell proliferation occurred and again teer values increased. complete layer confluence was again achieved between d 18- <dig> of ali and teer was stable with values of about  <dig> Ω·cm <dig>  in the remaining two cultures, teer values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  Ω·cm <dig> could be measured under lli conditions  and switching to ali resulted in a moderate but permanent teer decrease  without visible alteration in cell layer appearance. for these cultures, teer values were stable at about  <dig> Ω·cm <dig> between day  <dig> and  <dig> of ali. mean teer values of p <dig> cultures finally stabilized at  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for up to d  <dig> of ali ; among them two cultures remained stable even for up to  <dig> d .

when ebecs from the same  <dig> horses which were primarily cultured on solid supports were seeded on collagen-coated transwell membrane inserts, all p <dig> ali cultures were successfully established. these p <dig> cells showed more homogenous growth and bioelectrical behaviour than in p <dig> cultures. under lli conditions, p <dig> cells showed a slower rate of proliferation and development of bioelectrical resistance than p <dig> cells. confluence was usually not achieved even after  <dig> d of culture and this was the time required for teer to reach a threshold value of 50- <dig> Ω·cm <dig>  . in contrast to p <dig> cultures, switching p <dig> cultures to ali condition did neither alter cell layer morphology nor substantially affect teer values. usually, starting at d 6- <dig> of ali, intense cell proliferation coincided with a time-dependent increase in teer values. teer values of about 400- <dig> Ω·cm <dig> were usually observed between day  <dig> and  <dig> of ali and teer increased gradually, reaching maximum values of about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Ω·cm <dig>  by d  <dig>  these teer values remained stable for further  <dig> -  <dig> d  , with no apparent morphological alteration of the cell layer.

tight junction protein  expression in ebec p <dig> and p <dig> ali cultures
because high teer values implied the formation of functional tight junctions, we analyzed p <dig> and p <dig> ebec insert cultures for the expression of the tight junction protein zo- <dig>  by immunocytochemistry. in both p <dig>  and p <dig>  cultures we could observe continuous positive signals, lining cell boundaries, confirming the expression as well as the intercellular localization of tight-junctions.

depending on culture conditions and culture age, changes were seen in zo- <dig> expression. in lli cultures, the continuous green fluorescent rings of zo- <dig> looked large and corresponded to the numbers of green rings and dapi-stained nuclei. in mature ali-cultures, usually, more than one nucleus could be observed within a single fluorescent ring. moreover, nuclear and zo- <dig> stains could not be captured in the same plain of focus. the zo- <dig> positive cells per field progressively increased in number but decreased in size with the age of ali .

microscopic features of p <dig> and p <dig> ebec ali cultures
as assessed by light and electron microscopy, or by h&e staining and immunocytochemistry, p <dig> and p <dig> cells on membrane inserts showed similarities and differences depending on the conditions and age of the ali culture . regardless of confluence level, cells under lli condition , were large, uniform, with short microvilli and poorly defined borders   and formed a monolayered, flattened and almost undifferentiated epithelium . indeed, some ciliated cells could be observed in p <dig> cultures at this stage.

in contrast, once ali cultures were established, cells looked better defined, smaller in size, and with typical epithelial polygonal shape . immunofluorescence staining revealed 100% positivity for cks 5/6/ <dig>  and no signal for vim , confirming epithelial cell origin. cells of mature ali-cultures showed increased height, a columnar, monolayered pseudo-stratified epithelium . mature ali-cultures were pas-positive, suggesting the presence of mucus-producing cells . ciliary beating could be observed under light and phase contrast microscopy .

sem also revealed the presence of mucus and cilia on the apical cell surface of mature epithelial layers . a relatively large population of ciliated cells was usually observed quite early in p <dig> ali-cultures , while in p <dig> cultures, ciliated cells appeared generally at around d  <dig> of ali. the number of ciliated cells in p <dig> was lower than in p <dig> cultures but increased with age of the ali-cultures . interestingly, many apical microvilli were detected by sem in mature ali-cultures, located either on ciliated or non-ciliated cells , apparently larger in number and size than those observed in submerged cultures before ali-creation. moreover, in p <dig> ali-cultures many areas of the surface in which microvilli appeared were elongated, showing, in some cases, a complex spatial arrangement . finally, mature ebec cultures immunostained for the cell-type specific ck  <dig> showed weak diffused positive signals; only some confined areas had high signal intensity , while immunostaining for ck 10/ <dig> was negative .

discussion
in the present study, equine bronchial epithelial cells were isolated from bronchial branches of healthy horses and cultured on solid supports, under conventional submerged conditions or on semi-permeable transwell membrane inserts under ali conditions. to the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that growth and differentiation of these cells were characterized extensively. this characterization comprised growth in the presence or absence of serum in defined aecgm, the comparison of primary and passaged cells, and the monitoring biochemical and functional expression of tight junctions. the limiting factor was to find out an optimal condition for ebecs with ultimate epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation properties.

short-term  trypsin digestion of peeled and minced equine bronchial mucosa yielded large numbers of highly viable and pure epithelial cells. this isolation procedure and cell properties has been described recently for equine tracheal epithelial cells  <cit> , and appears advantageous over isolation techniques used to isolate bronchial cells from intact bronchial segments of the horse  <cit>  and other animal species  <cit> ; weak enzymes and longer digestion time  were applied which presumably increase the number of other non-epithelial contaminating cells. although trypsin is a strong dissociating enzyme, it did not affect the ability of ebecs to efficiently attach and replicate on collagen-coated plastic substratum. freshly isolated ebecs reached confluence in less than  <dig> days, in agreement with previous reports for equine  <cit>  and human  <cit>  tracheobronchial epithelial cells.

the presence or absence of serum in aecgm did not affect the growth rate of primary ebecs on solid supports, but striking morphological and functional differences were observed. when grown in defined serum-free aecgm, ebecs exhibited an almost undifferentiated and migratory phenotype, similar to that reported for primary serum-free solid cultures of equine tracheal  <cit>  and human bronchial  <cit>  epithelial cells. addition of 10% serum facilitated morphological and functional differentiation of ebecs as determined by the following phenotypes: 1) serum triggered more dome and cilia formation, cell-cell-contact and mucociliary differentiation that were retained over at least for  <dig> d  <cit> ; similar to what is reported for primary outgrown explants of tracheal, bronchial and nasal epithelial cells  <cit> ; 2) serum contributed to the formation of the cobblestone pattern and the continuous expression of zo- <dig> and enhanced mucociliary ebec differentiation; the latter confirmed by the apparent higher pas-positivity in serum-grown ebec cultures than those in serum-free. these findings suggest that serum constituents appeared to be necessary for the development of the complete differentiation potential as was described for airway epithelial cells in human and other species  <cit> . these factors may include retinoid acid or high calcium concentrations as described previously  <cit> .

while the defined and serum-free aecgm was sufficient to culture both primary and passaged ebecs on solid supports, this same medium was not suitable for sustaining proliferation of these cells on membrane insert that allow differentiation of ebecs. in contrast to other studies, even seeding cells at high density in medium without serum was not sufficient to promote cell growth on porous membranes. the addition of 10% bovine calf serum to our defined supplemented aecgm was crucial and has led, even if latency was seen in p <dig>  to rapid proliferation and differentiation of ebecs and sustaining the cultures even for over  <dig> d. effective proliferation of equine bronchial  <cit>  and human tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells  <cit>  has been reported to occur at lli in serum-free media. this contrast in observations may stem from differences in serum factors including calcium, albumin, and other adhesion molecules that are necessary for the proliferation, differentiation and long-term survival of ebecs  <cit> . replacement of fbs with ultroser g in a simple dmem/ham's f- <dig> medium plus retinoic acid also facilitated cell proliferation and differentiation when ebec cultured at ali  <cit> .

further, a striking observation in the present study was the difference in bioelectrical properties  obtained from p <dig> and p <dig> ebec ali cultures. first, in submerged culture conditions , teer was much higher in p <dig> than in p <dig> ebec cultures. this was consistent with the difference in growth rate observed in primary and passaged ebecs on solid supports. this difference may be due the selection of different epithelial cell populations during the passaging process. subsequently, creation of ali-culture conditions depended upon achievement of confluence for p <dig> cultures and upon achievement of a teer threshold value of 50- <dig> Ω·cm <dig> for p <dig> cultures, an indicator for the presence of functional tight junctions  <cit> . when switching from lli to ali, teer values in p <dig> culture gradually increased and were higher and more stable than in p <dig> cultures. this observation suggests that passaged cells establish better cell-cell-connection than freshly isolated cells  because p <dig> cells may be more heterogeneous and p <dig> cultures completely dedifferentiate to form tight monolayers as was observed for and ali-cultures from other species  <cit> .

teer values from p <dig> or p <dig> ebecs were similar to those found in bronchial cells of other species and the immunostaining for zo- <dig> was uniform in both p <dig> and p <dig> cultures. therefore, it is not clear what affects the teer value in the p <dig> and p <dig> cultures  <cit> . one can speculate that tight junction proteins other than zo- <dig> must be involved in establishing tight cell-to-cell contact  <cit> . moreover, the large inter-individual differences in teer values measured among ebec cultures established from different horses is an interesting feature. this suggests that polymorphic gene differences may exist in proteins that constitute the tight junction formation. future studies should consider screening for such polymorphisms; given that the equine genome has now been sequenced and studies to identify such inter-individual differences are feasible.

finally, in contrast to ebec cultures on solid supports, p <dig> and p <dig> ebecs cultured on membrane inserts developed in a time-dependent manner surface structures, i.e. microvilli, microvilli-like structures and cilia, suggesting the importance of ali conditions for establishing a state of differentiation that resembles the in vivo condition. in p <dig> ebec ali-cultures, cilia and microvilli were low in number and appeared in a delayed manner compared to p <dig> cells similar to what was observed in passaged airway epithelial cells in other species  <cit> .

cytokeratin staining for different epithelial cell population indicated the maturity of ebecs in ali-culture. the broad spectrum antibody anti-human ck 5/6/ <dig> stained positive p <dig> and p <dig> cells, suggesting the co-existence of columnar  and basal  cells. however, the pure anti-human ck  <dig> provided few signals in ebec cultures and the supra-basal cell marker anti-human ck 10/ <dig> showed no signal, suggesting a pseudo-stratified organization of the epithelial layers.

we also recognize several limitations to our study. we used primary ebecs from several strains of horses that could be the basis for the observed variations in teer values. future studies will focus on using ebecs from horses with the same strain and age to reduce variability. in addition, comparison of ebecs from healthy horses and those with reactive airway disease will clarify whether disease conditions may vary the the proliferative ability of cells in culture.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, findings of the present study show that ebecs can be isolated with high yield purity and viability and can be successfully cultured and sub-cultured up to passage  <dig> on solid supports. serum supplemented aecgm enhanced the growth, differentiation potential, and longevity of ebec cultures. on solid supports these ebec cultures differentiated to a mucociliary epithelium in ali conditions and were maintained over  <dig> days. teer assessment resulted in a marked difference between p <dig> and p <dig> ebec ali cultures, whereby for the latter teer values were higher and more stable, suggesting the suitability for in vitro studies of airway diseases. this equine airway cell model may facilitate investigations of the role of bronchial epithelia in the patho-physiology of airway diseases of the horse  and screening of pharmacologic treatments that could translate to designing more effective studies to treat human bronchial diseases.
