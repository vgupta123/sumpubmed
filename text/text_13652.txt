BACKGROUND
many pathogens have evolved strategies to survive within the hosts they infect. one strategy consists of varying the antigens the pathogen exposes to its host immune system, usually resulting in the proliferation of multicopy protein families, commonly named variable surface antigens   <cit> . in the case of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, there are three major vsa that allow the parasite to avoid the host's immune system and establish chronic infections: the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  <dig>  rifin and stevor proteins .

the rifin and stevor families are groups of vsa proteins that are unique to the plasmodium falciparum and p. reichenowi parasites  <cit> . they are only present in two species, but they number more than  <dig> copies per genome. although the genome of plasmodium falciparum has been fully sequenced  <cit> , the information obtained for the reference strain does not represent the full knowledge of these antigenic variant protein families. field isolates investigated for their repertoire of rif and stevor genes show an extensive variability  <cit> . this hypervariability makes these proteins difficult to study and their primary function remain to be discovered. a recent analysis of the whole rif gene repertoire, which encode for rifin proteins, from the reference genome has concluded that this family can be sub-divided into functionally distinct groups  <cit> . one of these sub-groups, a-rifin, as well as the stevor proteins are predominantly exposed to the host's immune system at the surface of the infected red blood cell   <cit> .

sequestration of infected rbcs is a virulence factor that allows the parasite to avoid passage through the spleen, therefore increasing its chances of survival. a recent analysis of gene expression of vsa of a p. falciparum strain isolated from a splenectomized patient showed that a-rif and stevor genes were not expressed  <cit> , whereas, in isolates from normal patients, these genes are expressed  <cit> . the authors relate this loss of expression to the loss of the sequestration phenotype. conversely, b-rif genes are expressed regardless of the absence of this virulent phenotype  <cit> . these differences in phenotype as well as in the localization of these proteins  <cit>  and the predicted sub-functionalization of rifin proteins  <cit>  demonstrate the importance of distinguishing each of these sub-groups. 

currently, the rifin and stevor protein families are represented by the pfam domain pf <dig>  <cit> . however, this hidden markov model  fails to distinguish rifin from stevor proteins. there are tigrfams hmms  <cit>  that do separate rifin and stevor proteins, but they fail to classify the rifin or stevor proteins into sub-groups. although stevor, a-rifin and the different b-rifin groups are identifiable by experts, they require cumbersome phylogenetic methods to be divided into their respective sub-groups  <cit> . in this study we report the development of a tool, consisting of a set of hmms and an evaluation program, to automatically sort rifin and stevor proteins according to their sub-groups. we have named the tool rspred for rifin and stevor predictor.

RESULTS
curation of the rifin and stevor repertoires of the plasmodium falciparum dd <dig> and hb <dig> genomes
we have carried out manual curation of the rifin and stevor repertoires in the dd <dig> and hb <dig> draft genomes. we used blast to detect the dd <dig> and hb <dig> sequences, using the entire 3d <dig> rif and stevor gene repertoire as query and the dd <dig> and hb <dig> supercontigs as databases. this allowed us to detect all potential rif and stevor genes.

we compared these blast hits with the automatically generated annotations provided by the broad institute. although most of our manually curated genes correspond to automatic annotations, we have revised the exon-intron boundaries for more than 25% of them . in addition to these modifications, we have found some odd predictions: four of our manually curated genes had automatic predictions as two genes, interrupted by a frame shift or stop codon, and one had been predicted as a shorter hypothetical gene on the opposite strand . finally, we have detected  <dig> genes that had no automatic predictions at all . the naming system of the dd <dig> and hb <dig> predicted genes uses the format pfdg_xxxxx and pfhg_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a number. currently, there are  <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes for dd <dig> and hb <dig>  respectively. we have decided to annotate the new genes using incremental numbering from  <dig> for dd <dig> and  <dig> for hb <dig>  i.e. pfdg_ <dig> and pfhg_ <dig>  additionally, we have appended all the rifin and stevor genes, manually curated for this study from dd <dig> and hb <dig>  with "-nj" in order to distinguish them from the original and future annotations. all curated genes from the dd <dig> and hb <dig> draft genomes  are deposited in the antigenic variation database vardb  <cit> .

sub-grouping, a new take on the matter
we needed curated data sets of sequences belonging to each group in order to train the hmms. stevor and rifin proteins share little similarity, which makes them easy to distinguish from one another after completion of multiple sequence alignment with known stevor and rifin sequences. full-length a-rifin and b-rifin proteins are easily recognized, upon visual inspection of multiple sequence alignments, based on the presence  or absence  of a fairly conserved  <dig> amino acid residue indel in the conserved region . however, the sub-groups within the b-rifin cluster are not so easily sorted without the help of phylogenetic analysis.

previous research, based on the rifin repertoire of the reference genome, describes three sub-groups in the b-rifin cluster: b1-, b2- and b3-rifin  <cit> . our present analysis confirms the integrity of the b1- and b2-rifin sub-groups. however, we find that there is too little coherence  within the b3-rifin cluster to make it form a defined sub-group. we propose to redefine these sequences simply as b-rifin.

we also investigated the homogeneity of the stevor family. in phylogenetic trees, derived from multiple sequence alignments of stevor proteins of sequences obtained from the three p. falciparum genomes, 3d <dig>  hb <dig> and dd <dig>  the majority of stevor proteins forms a cluster. however, a small group of proteins, which we call stevor-like, cluster separately from the main stevor group . these sequences differ from typical stevor proteins by different amino acid compositions from the signal sequence through the majority of the conserved domain. also, the variable domain's length is less consistent than in most stevor proteins. regardless of these differences, stevor-like proteins share short amino acid motifs throughout the protein, as well as the entirety of the very typical c-terminus, with stevor proteins.

sorting out the results and limits of detection
a program was created to evaluate the results obtained when the five hmms were used in database searches. this program uses cut-offs to determine the proper call for each sequence . since there are several cut-offs, our method includes several limits of detection .

the first lod is the detection of sequences as true or false: whether they are rifin or stevor sequences or neither. any score < <dig> is considered false, i.e. not a rifin or a stevor. of all the curated sequences in our dataset, three have scores <20: pfdg_ <dig>  pfdg_ <dig> and pfdg_ <dig>  the first protein, pfdg_ <dig>  is an extremely short protein derived from a gene at the end of the supercontig  <dig> . the sequencing coverage and assembly of contig ends are often questionable, generating erroneous sequences; therefore it is not surprising that this protein is not detected with the stevor hmm. the second protein, pfdg_ <dig>  is one of the three sequences of the rifa <dig> group described by wang et al.  <cit> . the two other rifa <dig> sequences, pfd0070c and pfhg_ <dig>  are among the proteins with the lowest of all the positive a-rifin hmm scores . these three sequences are extremely similar to each other with the exception of a short variable region preceding the c-terminal transmembrane domain. in the case of pfdg_ <dig>  it is a low complexity repeat of a ssggs motifs. additionally, this sequence is missing its n-terminal end. we assume that these circumstances, as well as the divergence of the rifa <dig> proteins from the basic rifin type, reduced its score below the detection limit. although these sequences are full length , all other low scoring  a-rifin sequences are fragments, again stressing the atypical properties of rifa <dig>  the third protein below the first lod, pfdg_ <dig>  is a partial sequence  covering only the c-terminal part of the protein. it is most similar to pfl2585c, a protein with very atypical n- and c-terminal ends, although the majority of the protein is typical of a-rifin proteins. the limited length and odd sequence of pfdg_ <dig> prevent its recognition as a rifin protein. thus the three proteins failing to reach the first lod have too little sequence similarity to be identified as rifin or stevor sequences.

the second lod is specific to stevor proteins: if the score against the stevor hmm is higher than the true/false cut-off, but < <dig>  then the sequence is reliably related to stevor proteins, but either differs from typical stevor sequences or is too fragmented to reach a high enough score. we refer to these potential stevor sequences as stevor-like proteins. the protein fragment pfhg_ <dig> is an example of low confidence sequence  that we assign as stevor-like, although it probably is a valid stevor fragment. among the sequences that score < <dig> with the stevor hmm are two identical sequences, pfc0045w and pfdg_ <dig>  found in the 3d <dig> and dd <dig> strains, respectively. the plasmodb version  <dig>  annotation for the pfc0045w protein is "rifin". however, although they are distinct from stevor proteins, our phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that these sequences are not rifin proteins, as they tend to cluster separately from the rifin and closer to stevor proteins. until we can accumulate more sequences of this type, rspred will predict these proteins to be similar to stevor and will assign them the stevor-like tag.

the third lod is specific to rifin proteins: if the score against either the a-rifin or the b-rifin hmm is higher than the score against the stevor hmm, but < <dig>  then the sequence is reliably a rifin protein, but it is not possible to identify its sub-group. typical examples are fragments of proteins, e.g. pfdg_ <dig>  pfhg_ <dig> and a1kqt <dig> . in several cases, the short length of the sequence and the absence of determining properties  result in these sequences having low scores against both the a-rifin and the b-rifin hmms. some rare proteins include enough of the conserved c <dig> region to identify them as a- or b-rifin, but nevertheless score < <dig> and are thus sorted into the rifin group. these sequences are most often truncated sequences or contain very odd amino acid composition, e.g. pfdg_ <dig> and pfhg_ <dig>  respectively, possibly caused by low sequencing coverage or genome assembly problems.

finally, the fourth limit of detection concerns b1- and b2-rifin proteins: if the score against the b-rifin hmm is > <dig>  but the b1- and b2-rifin hmms do not reach the cut-offs, then the protein will be evaluated as b-rifin instead of its proper sub-group. among all the sequences from our curated dataset, we have not detected any false negative b1- or b2-rifin sequences.

automatic detection of rifin and stevor sub-groups in draft genomes
we applied our hmms to all coding sequences  equal to or longer than  <dig> amino acids from  <dig> draft genomes  that do not have available annotations. the screening of these cds gave variable results, depending on the genome, from  <dig> to  <dig> rifin and stevor sequences detected . although most of these genomes have been sequenced to a very low coverage , each sub-group was detected in almost all genomes. the only exceptions are the 7g <dig> genome in which b1-rifin proteins were not found and fcc-2_hainan in which b2-rifin proteins were not detected. interestingly the plasmodium reichenowi genome had the highest number of hits.

all cds, equal to or larger than  <dig> amino acids in length, from publically available draft genomes were scored with rspred.

negative datasets
currently, rifin and stevor proteins have only been found in plasmodium falciparum and the related p. reichenowi. neither pfam nor tigrfams detect these proteins in any other known species. additionally, orthology prediction tools and databases do not yield any rifin or stevor homologues in any other species  <cit> . finally, the investigation of other plasmodium multigene families have not detected any rifin or stevor homologous proteins  <cit> . hence, we decided to use other plasmodium species as negative controls. no rifin or stevor sequences were predicted in p. vivax, p. yoelii, p. berghei, p. knowlesi or p. chabaudi. rspred was also run against the entire uniprot database, but there were no rifin or stevor sequences predicted, except for those belonging to p. falciparum.

comparison with pfam and tigrfams
other prediction methods exist for the rifin and stevor protein families, although each one has its limitations. pfam  <cit>  only predicts if a sequence is a rifin/stevor  or not, while tigrfams  <cit>  only separates rifin  from stevor  proteins. additionally, the tigrfams were trained as global models and therefore do not detect sequence fragments. none of the two predict rifin sub-groups, as rspred does.

in order to test the sensitivity of the three methods, we applied them to the set of rifin and stevor sequences that were not used for the training of rspred. out of  <dig> rifin/stevor sequences, rspred identified  <dig>  of them, whereas pfam detected  <dig>  and tigrfams only detected  <dig> . both tigrfams and pfam fail to identify low scoring stevor, and the former also fails to identify fragments. the sorting of rifin and stevor proteins into sub-groups makes rspred more specific than the other models. in addition, rspred detects more sequences than pfam and tigrfams; it is therefore also the most sensitive of the three methods.

discussion
redefining the rifin and stevor sub-groups
previous studies describe rifin and stevor sequences as a large group of related proteins unique to p. falciparum. subsequent analysis of the rifin protein family, based on the reference genome, showed that the rifin family can be further sub-grouped into a- and b-rifin sequences and the latter divided into b1-, b2- and b3-rifin  <cit> .

our current analysis, which includes many more sequences, confirms the sub-division of rifin sequences into a-, b1- and b2-rifin groups, which all have defined characteristics. however, it is an overstatement to create a defined group for the remaining b-rifin sequences. these sequences represent a heterogeneous cluster  of sequences that are defined by the fact that they are not a-rifin sequences and have relatively little similarity to b1- and b2-rifin proteins. we have therefore decided to retrograde the b3-rifin sequences to the rank of b-rifin.

a recent study has defined potential sub-groups within the a-rifin sequences, rifa <dig> and rifa <dig>  these groupings rely on sequence similarity of 71% and 84% and, for a large majority, their genomic location in a head-to-head orientation with group a var genes  <cit> . we have not trained hmms to recognize these groups because of the low number of sequences available from the curated datasets. also, we find that there are several other such sub-group candidates, but the small number of sequences within a single genome makes it difficult to distinguish between bona fide sub-groups and recently expanded genes.

these authors also defined a sub-group, rifa <dig>  which is composed of one divergent rifin sequence that is present, with 78% conservation, in all genomes investigated  <cit> . the case of single copy genes that are very conserved between genomes are possibly better classified as conserved genes rather than sub-groups. also, we have noted that the proteins that compose the rifa <dig> group score the lowest of all rifin sequences, with one of them predicted as "false". the fact that partial a-rifin protein sequences score higher than the full length rifa <dig> and the divergence of these sequences from typical rifin proteins strongly suggests that these are related to rifin proteins but have a different function not requiring multiple copies for the survival of the parasite.

in this study, we have only focused on the three genomes  for which annotations are available as well as the uniprot database that contains data from field studies. we confirm the finding, by wang et al.  <cit> , that several rifin sequences are relatively conserved across strains, however it is difficult to evaluate whether this represents a measure of the divergence of parasite populations or if they have been evolutionarily selected for specific functions.

also, we have chosen to adopt a conservative approach to the stevor designation. all sequences that are clearly related to stevor sequences, but that do not score high enough will be tagged stevor-like by the rspred program.

ambiguous sequences
four sequences predicted to be a-rifin proteins also had relatively high scores  with either the b1- or the b2-rifin hmm. upon closer inspection of these sequences, applying phylogenetic analysis to alignments of each half of these proteins, it appears that their n-terminal half correspond well with a-rifin sequences whereas their c-terminal half is characteristic of b1- or b2-rifin proteins . these sequences are hybrids between a- and b1/2-rifin proteins and confirm previous reports of recombination as a mean for the diversification of these vsa gene families  <cit> .

advantages, limits and utility of rspred
we have named our set of hmms and the evaluation program rspred, for rifin and stevor predictor. we have shown that it efficiently detects rifin and stevor proteins and classifies them according to their sub-group. although there are no false positive detections, rspred is conservative with truncated and remotely related sequences. however, most of these sequences are at least recognized and predicted as rifin or stevor proteins. finally, rspred proves to be more sensitive than the existing pfam and tigrfams hmms  <cit> , which are also limited in the scope of their classification, as they do not recognize rifin or stevor sub-groups.

we have applied rspred to whole proteomes extracted from novel genome assemblies. although these genomes are mostly sequenced to a very low coverage , we were able to detect all sub-groups within these genomes. this resource will be increasingly useful as more genomes are being sequenced: in particular, there is a large plasmodium genome sequencing project  <cit>  that is scheduled to sequence over  <dig> plasmodium parasite genomes, which will allow for meta-genomic analysis of the rifin and stevor protein families.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of proteins that are members of large families is often overwhelming due to the difficulty to assign proper classification. the rifin and stevor families are such groups of proteins: complications are in part due to their large diversity within each parasite's genome, but even more so with the extreme diversity between parasite populations  <cit> . our prediction tool, rspred, is designed to simplify the classification of these proteins into previously identified sub-groups  <cit>  with the following benefits:

• it eliminates the need to manually retrieve reference sequences and perform multiple sequence alignments;

• it eliminates the need for any prior knowledge of these protein families in order to sort them properly;

• it out performs existing tools;

• it identifies and sorts rifin proteins into rifin, a-rifin, b-rifin, b1-rifin and b2-rifin.

although these groups probably have diverged in function  <cit> , the sequence conservation between these proteins assumes that their respective functions are still closely related. greater knowledge of the smaller sub-groups b1- and b2-rifin proteins will improve our understanding of the larger a-rifin and stevor groups that play a more preponderant role at the surface of the infected host cell  <cit> .
