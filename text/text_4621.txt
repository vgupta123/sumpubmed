BACKGROUND
grain protein content  is an important quality determinant in cereal crops. in barley, gpc is closely associated with feed and malt quality. higher protein content is favorable for feed quality, while lower or moderate protein content is expected for malt barley. gpc affects malting quality in many ways, including yeast nutrition, haze formation in beer and enzyme activities  <cit> .

barley gpc is under polygenic control, with many quantitative trait loci  having been mapped on all seven chromosomes, mainly on 2h, 4h, 5h and 6h  <cit> . all these loci had been determined by qtl mapping. recently, genome-wide association study  has been developed to dissect a variety of complex traits in plant  <cit> . gwas has the advantage over the conventional qtl mapping in that gwas can be performed on a number of genotypes. while a population used for conventional qtl mapping is developed from a bi-parental cross, only allowing the detection of a subset of loci/alleles within a plant and offering limited the resolution, due to insufficient recombination between the linked genetic loci. hence, gwas may present wider genetic variations and higher mapping resolution on phenotypes and traits at population level than conventional qtl mapping  <cit> . in barley, seven malt quality traits and some important agronomic traits have been effectively analyzed using gwas  <cit> .

qinghai-tibet plateau, considered as one of the original centers of cultivated barley in the world, is rich in barley germplasm  <cit> . the polymorphism information content  value of tibetan wild barley is higher than that of chinese landraces according to analysis of ssr markers, and the wild barley has more unique alleles than the cultivated barley  <cit> . thus, tibetan wild barley is assumed to have wider variability in the genes controlling gpc  <cit> . therefore, the population derived from tibetan wild barley and cultivated barley worldwide could provide high resolution for gwas in barley gpc.

a wheat qtl controlling gpc, named as gpc-b <dig>  was cloned, and a transcription factor  was related to gpc by regulating senescence and protein remobilization  <cit> . two orthologs genes  of ttnam-b <dig> in barley were identified on chromosomes 6h and 2h, respectively  <cit> . the single nucleotide polymorphism  analysis showed that allelic variation of the nam- <dig> gene could be associated with gpc variation within the hordeum genus. the differences in expression of hvnam- <dig> or other genes among barley cultivars or species could be attributed to gpc variation  <cit> . however, little research has been done regarding barley hvnam <dig> up to date,except that the sequence of hvnam <dig> was published  <cit> .

the objectives of the current study are  to examine the correlation between gpc and malt quality;  to identify molecular markers associated with gpc in a barley mapping population by gwas and determine the candidate genes controlling gpc; and  to analyze the association between hvnam genes and gpc.

methods
plant materials
a collect of  <dig> barley accessions was used for association mapping and gpc analysis. these accessions included  <dig> barley cultivars  from different areas of the world and  <dig> tibetan wild barley . all barley cultivars and accessions were planted at the huajiachi campus of zhejiang university  in the early winter of  <dig> and  <dig>  each accession was sown into a two-line plot,  <dig> m long and  <dig>  m interval between the lines, and  <dig> seeds were planted in each line. all plots were supplied with  <dig> kg/ha of n, including  <dig> kg/ha of n as compound fertilizer applied before seeding, and  <dig> kg/ha of n as urea supplied at two-leaf stage and booting stage, respectively with equal amount. in addition,  <dig> kg/ha of potassium chloride was applied prior to seeding. the experiments were arranged in a block design with two replications. in each block, the  <dig> barley accessions were arranged randomly. all other agronomic managements, including weed and disease control, were the same as those applied locally. at seedling stage, leaves of each genotype were collected for dna extract. the harvested seeds were stored at 4°c prior to malting. gpc and malt quality of all samples were measured, three measurements were done for each sample.

gpc measurement
mature grains were ground in a cyclotec  <dig> sample mill  and passed through a  <dig>  mm screen. gpc was measured using the kjeldahl method  <cit> . protein content is calculated by duplicating a factor of  <dig>  with n content.

malting and quality analysis
grain samples  were micro-malted in a micro-malting apparatus  using the following regime:  <dig> h steep,  <dig> h air-rest,  <dig> h steep,  <dig> h air-rest and  <dig> h steep, followed by  <dig> h germination – all performed at 15°c. the malts were then kilned at 65°c for  <dig> h, de-rooted and milled using a tecator cyclone mill fitted with a  <dig>  mm screen. the soluble and total protein contents  in malt and the malt quality parameters  were determined according to the analytica ebc official methods .

dna extraction and genotypic analysis
genomic dna samples from young leaves of the barley seedlings were isolated as described by uzunova et al.  <cit> . in brief, the leaf tissues were ground, and the resulting powder was re-suspended with ctab  buffer . to purify the dna, insoluble particulates were removed through centrifugation. dnas were precipitated from the aqueous phase and were washed thoroughly to remove contaminating salts.

whole-genome profiling of dart in all the dna samples were analyzed using the barley psti  version  <dig>  array  <cit>  at the diversity arrays technology pty ltd in australia. there are around  <dig>  dart markers, polymorphic in a wide range of barley cultivars, and  <dig>  markers detected in wild barley accessions . among the  <dig>  reported markers and  <dig>  polymorphic dart markers, those with p value <  <dig>  were used in the current study.

the primer pairs were designed using primer <dig>  <cit>  based on the hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> sequences . 5′-atgggcagcccggactcatcctcc-3′ and 5′-tacagggattccagttcacgccggat-3′, 5′-atgggcagctcggactcatcttcc-3′ and 5′-tcagggattccagttcacgccgga-3′ were used for amplification of hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig>  respectively. the pcr reaction mixture contains  <dig> mm tris–hcl,  <dig> mm kcl,  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  l m of each dntp,  <dig> pmol of each primer, 50– <dig> ng of genomic dna and one unit of taq dna polymerase . the reaction was initially denatured at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s, 60°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig>  min. the pcr was terminated at 72°c for  <dig> min. the bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit  was used for sequencing. the complete gene sequence was analyzed using bioedit software .

data analysis
pearson correlation analysis was conducted between gpc, spc, tpc and malt quality parameters using spss  <dig>  and sigmaplot  <dig> . alignment of all the sequences was performed by clustalw  <cit> . genetic diversity was examined by  <dig> randomly-distributed barley dart markers over the genome at diversity arrays technology pty ltd, australia. the genetic polymorphism data from  <dig> dart markers were utilized to detect population structure by structure software version  <dig> . <dig> using an admixture model and five independent replicates of  <dig>  markov chain iterations  <cit> . k values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> were tested with a burn-in of  <dig>  iterations and  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo  iterations according to the software’s instructions. the effect of population structure on gpc was tested using sas glm . the model included the components of the q matrix obtained with structure  <dig> . <dig>  which was used to illustrate population structure. r <dig>  was considered as an estimate of the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by population structure. the principal component analysis  was performed on the genotype data derived from  <dig> dart markers, which were standardized firstly using unscrambler  <dig>  . tassel  <dig>  was used to calculate linkage disequilibrium  based on the parameter r <dig>  which is a measurement of the correlation between a pair of variables  <cit> . the pair-wise relationship matrix , which was further employed for population correction in the association models, was calculated with  <dig> dart markers using tassel  <dig>  <cit> . the two-year data of gpc were averaged for future association analysis. the structure-based association analysis with a k-matrix between dart markers, hvnam genes and gpc was calculated using tassel  <dig>  <cit> . association between dart markers and the total trait variation was tested using mixed linear models , which was implemented in tassel  <dig> . the p values were adjusted with permutation test using a step-down minp procedure implemented in the tassel  <dig> . the adjusted p value <  <dig>  or < <dig>  was considered as a criterion for association. the manhattan plot of dart markers and p value were drawn with the r software version  <dig> . <dig> . the association map was constructed using mapdraw version  <dig>   <cit> .

sequences of hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> were aligned using vectornti  <dig>   or clc main workbench  <dig> , and alignments were edited manually using the bioedit software. haplotypes were inferred using the software tassel  <dig>  <cit> . one barley accession was inferred as rare haplotypes and was excluded from further analysis. grouped according to haplotypes in the hvnam genes, gpc variation among the  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions was performed using the software sas  <dig>  software . for further association analysis between haplotype and gpc in the total  <dig> accessions, the sas  <dig>  software  was used to conduct analysis of variance  and multi-comparison analyses with least significant differences , the mean difference is significant at  <dig>  level.

RESULTS
the variation of protein content and kolbach index
the gpc in  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a mean of  <dig> % in  <dig> and varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a mean of  <dig> % in  <dig> . overall, tibetan wild barley had higher gpc than cultivated barley . moreover, a normal distribution pattern of gpc is presented in figure  <dig>  suggesting multiple genes/qtls control of gpc in barley. there was also a large variation in spc, tpc and kolbach index of the  <dig> accessions .

the values of gpc, spc and tpc between  <dig> and  <dig> were significantly and positively correlated  , while the data of kolbach index in  <dig> could account for  <dig> % of variation in  <dig>  thus, it may suggest that gpc, spc, tpc and kolbach index are mainly controlled by genetic factors and also affected by environmental variation.

the relationship between gpc, spc, tpc and four malt quality parameters
the gpc presented the similar results in both years , so the mean values of two years were used in the correlation analysis. the results showed that gpc was significantly and positively correlated with spc , tpc  and dp , and negatively correlated with malt extract  . there was no significant correlation between gpc and viscosity or kolbach index. spc was positively correlated with tpc , kolbach index  and dp , and negatively correlated with viscosity , indicating the significance of spc in determining malt quality. moreover, tpc was positively correlated with dp  and negatively correlated with malt extract  .

population structure and its impact on gpc variation
one of the primary objectives in the current study was to determine the possibility whether gwas could be used in association analysis of barley gpc and genetic markers. hence, we obtained ld  of the population used in this experiment. the extent of the obtained ld extended over  <dig>  cm , and  <dig> dart were distributed randomly over the whole barley genome, ensuring a good coverage of dart markers on barley genome. the presence of population stratification and an unequal distribution of alleles within these groups could result in nonfunctional and spurious associations  <cit> . thus, the population structure was taken into account in this study. the  <dig> dart markers were used to evaluate the subset of  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley genotypes. stratification within the barley population was detected by structure and pca. the highest likelihoods for sub-population  calculated with structure software were k =  <dig> , indicating that seven sub-populations have the most stable variance. in addition, a pca of the population structure was conducted. interestingly, the cultivated and tibetan wild barley were clearly separated into two groups with pca , the cultivated barley accessions demonstrated a more distinct membership to subpopulation  <dig> and  <dig>  while the tibetan wild barley accessions belonged to subpopulation  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . collectively, these seven components accounted for  <dig> % of the genetic variation. the first component accounted for 32% variation, while the second component explained 11% of the genetic variation . then, a q matrix with  <dig> sub-populations was used in the further analysis. variance analysis of gpc data in  <dig> and  <dig> showed that population structure explains  <dig> % of total variation, indicating the presence of impact of population structure on gpc.

association of dart markers with gpc and determination of candidate genes
generally, a stringent model may cause less spurious background association. in the current study, the structure-based association analysis with a k-matrix was calculated using tassel  <dig>  <cit> .

the two trials in  <dig> and  <dig> showed similar results; therefore, we combined the two year data and used the means for association analysis. the adjusted p values, obtained from step-down minp procedure, were used for permutation test  <cit> . as the markers with adjusted p values < . <dig> are considered as significant, the probability of rejecting a single true null hypothesis across the entire set of hypotheses is held to < <dig> . this test takes dependence between hypotheses into account and does not assume that hypotheses are independent as do other multiple test correction procedures  <cit> . here, the association of dart and gpc was shown in a manhattan plot . when the adjusted p value was < <dig> , there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dart markers, which were associated with gpc on 1h, 2h, 3h, 5h and 7h, respectively. interestingly, five molecular markers in this study were close to the genetic markers of gpc reported previously . of them, bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were close to marker hvbkasi, which was identified as hvnam <dig> <cit> . in addition, bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> were close to the markers hvm <dig> and bmag <dig> 

*p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> .

it was reported that the results of association analysis is affected by environmental factors  <cit> . thus, a stringent criterion for significance, may bias studies against detection of causal associations that show significant genotype-environment interactions  <cit> . the correlation analysis of gpc between  <dig> and  <dig> showed that gpc were mainly controlled by genetic factors, but also affected by environmental conditions. hence, we set the threshold of association analysis to  <dig> , so as to detect possible markers associated with gpc. when the adjusted p value was < <dig> , we found that gpc in barley was under polygenic control, and the relevant genes/qtls were located on almost all chromosomes, except for 4h, mainly on chromosomes 2h and 7h . there were  <dig> dart markers associated with gpc on chromosomes 1h and 5h,  <dig> on 2h,  <dig> on 3h,  <dig> on 6h, and  <dig> on 7h, respectively. the associated markers accounted for gpc variance ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. several dart markers associated with gpc were closely localized within the genome. thus, we considered the associated dart markers within  <dig> cm to be the same locus. as a result, there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> loci on chromosome 1h, 2h, 3h, 5h, 6h, and 7h, respectively. among those, a major qtl for gpc, which accounted for 40% of total variation, was quite close to the markers abg <dig>  hvm <dig>  and mwg <dig>  and it could be orthologous to the gpc-b <dig> gene located on wheat chromosome 6bs. the gpc-b <dig> was associated with increased grain protein in wheat  <cit>  and this qtl was identified as hvnam <dig> in barley  <cit>  . similarly, in our study, the markers bpb- <dig>  bpb- <dig> and bpb- <dig> associated with gpc in barley were close to the markers abg <dig>  hvm <dig>  and mwg <dig>  in addition, the best neighbor joining tree showed that hvnam genes have the closest distance with wheat nam genes  <cit> , and the colinearity of nam locus between barley and wheat was also revealed  <cit> . then, we inferred that hvnam genes could be related to gpc in barley. thus, hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> were chosen as the candidate genes for further association analysis of gpc.

association of hvnam genes with gpc
the sequences of the hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> genes were analyzed against the references from ncbi . the structure and snps of hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the amplified length of hvnam <dig> gene was  <dig> bp, containing  <dig> exons,  <dig> introns and a nam super-family domain from amino acid  <dig> to  <dig>  in comparison with the reference sequence , the hvnam <dig> in this study had five snps, located on bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in cultivated barley, and on bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tibetan wild barley . all of the snps were within the coding region and resulted in  <dig> amino acid substitutions, where trp, ala, gly, gly, and ala were replaced with cys, pro, ser, ala, and thr, respectively. there was no association between hvnam <dig> polymorphism and gpc. because no snp of hvnam <dig> gene was found to be associated with gpc, haplotype-based association analysis was performed. using the software tassel  <dig>  to infer haplotypes for hvnam <dig> gene among all accessions, we found five haplotypes within this gene. three and  <dig> haplotypes were found in  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley genotypes, respectively. there were one and two unique haplotypes in cultivated and tibetan barley, respectively . to analyze the possible differential effects of haplotypes on gpc, the population structure was taken into account. the haplotypes of hvnam <dig> explained  <dig> % gpc variance in the tested population. as observed for the whole panel of accessions, the accessions carrying haplotype  <dig> of hvnam <dig> had the highest gpc, whereas accessions with haplotype  <dig> of hvnam <dig> had lowest gpc in two years .
hvnam 
genes in cultivated and tibetan wild barleys

the amplified hvnam <dig> gene contained  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns with a nam super-family domain between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  and its length was 1528bp. the polypeptide sequence of hvnam <dig> showed 80% identity to that of hvnam <dig>  eight snps were located on bases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tibetan wild barley, while  <dig> polymorphisms were present on bases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the cultivated barley. among these snps, snp <dig> and snp <dig> were within introns, while the others were within the coding sequence. snp <dig>  snp <dig>  snp <dig> and snp <dig> led to amino acid substitutions, specifically arg, ala, ser and asn replacement with lys, thr, ala and tyr, respectively. six haplotypes could be classified according to polymorphisms among cultivated and tibetan wild barley. moreover, one haplotype in cultivated barley and  <dig> haplotypes in tibetan wild barley were found unique . the presence of new polymorphisms in tibetan wild barley indicated that it could provide a new genetic resource in the genetic improvement of barley. however, only one snp  located within the second intron of hvnam <dig>  was associated with gpc as determined in two consecutive years in  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley genotypes. moreover, in order to analyze the effect of hvnam <dig> haplotypes on gpc in barley, one haplotype with one accession was excluded from the six haplotypes of hvnam <dig>  the haplotypes of hvnam <dig> explained  <dig> % gpc variance in our population. we observed that the haplotype  <dig> of hvnam <dig> was higher in gpc, while the haplotype  <dig> of hvnam <dig> had the lowest gpc in both years .

discussion
barley used for malting should have a gpc lower than  <dig> %. gpc is influenced to a large extent by both genotype and environment  <cit> . in the current study, phenotyping of the diversity panel provided some valuable information about the range and distribution of gpc in barley. genotype and environment interactions are indeed apparent when comparing the gpc data over the two consecutive years. our results showed that some tibetan wild accessions with higher gpc could be useful for breeding both feed and food barley cultivars. although there were significant differences in gpc, spc and tpc among genotypes over the two consecutive years, the traits were mainly controlled by genetic factors as indicated by their high consistency over the two years.

a negative correlation between gpc and malt extract and a positive correlation between gpc and dp have been reported  <cit> . similarly, in the current study, we found that tpc was negatively correlated with malt extract and positively correlated with dp. interestingly, spc was correlated with all malt quality parameters except malt extract. obviously, the protein content in both grain and malt is closely related to malt quality. therefore, it is imperative for us to develop barley varieties with stable gpc in malt barley breeding.

the advantages of gwas over the conventional qtl mapping, based on a population from a bi-parental cross have been confirmed  <cit> . compared to qtl mapping, gwas increases the range of natural variation that can be surveyed in a single experiment and the number of significant regions that are likely to be identified  <cit> . hence, gwas could provide higher resolution than qtl mapping, and facilitate fine-mapping and gene discovery. the materials used in our gwas study, included  <dig> worldwide cultivated and  <dig> tibetan wild barley accessions, which cover representative accessions from most of the barley-growing regions in the world.

gpc were mainly controlled by genetic factors and also affected by environmental variation according the correlation analysis. however, a stringent criterion for significance, may bias studies against detection of causal associations that show significant genotype-environment interactions  <cit> . thus, we chose  <dig>  and  <dig>  as the threshold of association analysis, in order to detect possible markers associated with gpc. as a result, gwas identified as many as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci to be associated with barley gpc on chromosomes 1h, 2h, 3h, 5h, 6h and 7h, respectively. these results showed that many more molecular markers associated with gpc could be detected by gwas than by conventional qtl mapping.

in addition to the discovery of the dart markers for gpc, the completion of the association map for gpc is a significant step towards the cloning of gpc related genes. the identified markers for gpc will be very useful in the evaluation and screening of barley accessions with reasonable gpc. in comparison with previous studies  <cit> , we found more markers in this study, including  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> marker on chromosome 6h, 2h and 5h, respectively . three major qtls were identified on chromosomes 6h and 2h using a barley mapping population developed from a cross between ‘karl’, a low grain protein six-rowed variety and ‘lewis’, a high grain protein two-rowed variety. the three qtls could explain 56% of the total heritable variance of gpc  <cit> . two of them were identified as the hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> genes in barley, the homologs of a nac transcription factor  that increases gpc by regulating senescence in wheat  <cit> . therefore, we considered hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> as the candidate genes controlling gpc. due to the effect of gene-target association to identify snp markers for use in barley  <cit> , the association between two candidate genes, hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig>  and gpc was analyzed, in order to examine the genetic architecture of gpc and to identify gpc loci in barley.

jamar et al. found that allelic variation of the functional nam- <dig> gene could be associated with gpc variation within the genus hordeum <cit> , and the  <dig> genotypes used in their study could be classified into three haplotypes:  <dig> european varieties of h. vulgare being gathered as haplotype  <dig>  one h. spontaneum  and one hordeum bulbosum  being classified as haplotype  <dig>  and haplotype  <dig> , respectively. by comparing to the reference sequence ,  <dig> snps were identified on bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of hvnam <dig>  however, we did not identify these snps in the current study. instead, we found  <dig> snps located on bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the cultivated barley and  <dig> snps on bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tibetan wild barley. no association was detected between the polymorphisms of hvnam <dig> and gpc, however there was significant correlation between hvnam <dig> haplotypes and gpc. moreover, eight snps within hvnam <dig> were located on bases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the tibetan wild barley, but only  <dig> snps were present on bases  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the cultivated barley. interestingly, a single snp  within hvnam <dig> gene, located on the second intron, was associated with gpc. to gain further insight, the correlation between hvnam <dig> haplotypes and gpc was analyzed in barley, where the dart markers close to hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> explained 18% and  <dig> % gpc variance, while the haplotypes of hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig> accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of gpc variance, respectively. the comprehensive analysis, including the primary gwas, the colinearity of nam locus between barley and wheat, the best neighbor joining tree of nam genes in arabidopsis and other crops and the association analysis of hvnam genes, indicated that hvnam genes could drive the variation in barley gpc. moreover, the results also showed that the adjusted p value <  <dig>  could be reasonable for finding the molecular markers associated with traits which are greatly affected by environmental factors. in fact, the threshold with p < <dig>  used in our primary gwas of gpc ensured identification of the dart markers, which were not detected in the analysis with the threshold of p < <dig> . one of candidate genes, hvnam <dig>  detected in the association analysis with adjusted p values < <dig> , was found to be associated with gpc. the current results indicate the suitability of the adjusted p value < <dig>  for identifying the molecular markers associated with gpc. similarly, the adjusted p values < <dig>  was used as the criteria for association analysis in other research  <cit> .

ultimately, the identification of snps and haplotypes of hvnam genes could enable the development of useful molecular markers for gpc. here, the association analysis may provide some molecular markers of hvnam genes with potential importance for the early selection in malt barley breeding.

more importantly, it will shed some light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the genotypic differences of gpc in cultivated and wild barley. furthermore, the exact chromosome regions of these markers would be interesting for researchers to understand the genetics of gpc, since most of these regions have been not annotated in terms of their function. however, association mapping only provides statistical and indirect evidences for the function of identified genes, so we are targeting some direct evidences into the underlying molecular mechanisms of gpc and malting quality in future research.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated close correlation between protein content and malt quality parameters, indicating that it is imperative for us to develop barley varieties with a stable gpc. the identified markers for gpc in this study will be very useful in evaluation and screening of barley germplasm with reasonable gpc. moreover, the haplotypes of hvnam <dig> and hvnam <dig>  snp and dart markers, which were associated with gpc in barley, could provide key molecular markers for the selection of malt quality traits. in addition, gwas is very useful for finding candidate genes and may provide a powerful tool for identifying the different loci influencing gpc in barley.
