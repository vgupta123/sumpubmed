BACKGROUND
antimicrobial peptides  are short sequence peptides, normally less than  <dig> amino acid residues, reported in living systems. they are components of the defense system against pathogens in plants and animals or are produced by microorganisms in antibiosis processes . around  <dig>  amps have been reported
 <cit> . they can structurally be linear peptides ; cysteine-rich open-ended peptides with disulfide bridges; cyclopeptides forming a peptide ring, or pseudopeptides. amps offer major perspectives as a novel class of therapeutic agents, especially against fungal infections and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens in humans and animals
 <cit> . this great potential extends to plant disease-protection products
 <cit> , as substitutes of antibiotics in animal feed, biopreservatives in food, cosmetics and biomaterials, and as antifouling agents
 <cit> . amps have proved successful as biopesticides, with commercial development of several microorganisms secreting these compounds
 <cit> .

in recent years, novel peptides have been designed, based on natural amps, with the aim of optimizing the activity against selected target pathogens  while decreasing toxicity to non-target organisms and increasing stability. short truncated compounds , chimerical constructions and improved sequence analogs have been reported. examples are mellitin derivatives blocking plant viruses
 <cit> , the anti-fungal and anti-bacterial lactoferricin b derivatives
 <cit> , antifungal cecropin a and cecropin a-mellitin derived peptides
 <cit> , and the de novo designed antifungal hexapeptide paf26
 <cit>  and bactericide cyclic decapeptide bpc <dig> series
 <cit> .

genetically modified  plants with different degrees of resistance to pathogens have been obtained by expression of native or synthetic analogues of amps, either constitutively or in response to pathogen attack . these include amps naturally produced by insects
 <cit>  and amphibians
 <cit> ; fungal
 <cit>  and plant defensins
 <cit> ; and modified amp analogues such as the magainine derived myp30
 <cit>  and msi-99
 <cit> , msra <dig>  derived from temporin a
 <cit>  and msra <dig>  derived from dermaseptin b1
 <cit> , the chimeric peptides msra <dig> and cema derived from cecropin a and mellitin
 <cit>  and the synthetic d4e <dig> peptide
 <cit> . the expression of these amps in plants including tobacco, rice, potato, tomato, grapevine and cotton, have been found to give moderate resistance to relevant plant pathogenic bacteria or fungi.

combinatorial chemistry approaches have been used to assist the design of new amps with superior properties. the cecmel <dig> peptide library, a 125-member linear undecapeptide library contains groups of sequences with high activity against a number of reporter bacterial and fungal phytopathogenic species, several also exhibiting lowsensitivity to protease degradation and hemolytic activity
 <cit> . these peptides were cecropin a-mellitin hybrids and had the structure of an amphipathic α-helix with strong positive charge at neutral ph that can facilitate electrostatic attraction to phospholipid membranes of the target microorganisms, prior to insertion of the hydrophobic face into the membrane bilayer
 <cit> . in particular, bp <dig>  displays strong, selective bactericidal activity against three plant pathogenic bacteria at micromolar concentrations, with poor antifungal properties that inhibit infections by xanthomonas vesicatoria in pepper, erwinia amylovora in apple and pseudomonas syringae in pear
 <cit> . the efficacy of control is comparable to standard antibiotics and it is highly biocompatible, as assessed by acute oral toxicity tests in mice
 <cit> .

the envisaged phytosanitary applications of the bp <dig> series of peptides makes its expression in plant systems relevant, either as potent tools to confer plant phenotypes resistance to bacterial and/or fungal pathogen species, or as biofactories of plant protection products. phytosanitary use of these peptides against bacterial diseases of plants is limited by the high cost of production. large-scale chemical synthesis of peptides above around  <dig> amino acids is only economically viable for applications of very high added value; in view of its low toxicity against animal models, the use of gm plants as amp molecular farms could putatively be an economic alternative. production of a number of proteins using plants as biofactories has been reported in pharmaceutical applications
 <cit> , and a number of companies are currently using different approaches with various proteins
 <cit> .

however, expression of amps in plants requires specific strategies, due to their particular properties, and has proven challenging. the  <dig> and  <dig> amino-acid long d4e <dig> and msra <dig> are among the shortest peptides expressed in plants
 <cit> . however, a number of amps with relevant properties are shorter. in particular, combinatorial chemistry approaches used to engineer improved synthetic peptides are usually based on smaller lengths
 <cit> . for expression in plant systems, the length of these peptides should be increased above a minimum threshold while maintaining biological properties
 <cit> . amps with high antimicrobial activity have been associated with high toxicity to transgenic plant cells, and peptides with moderate activity have often been expressed, including those especially modified to decrease the antimicrobial activity . foreign amps expressed in plants can be prone to cellular degradation by endogenous peptidases, thereby limiting the level of accumulation . targeting the endoplasmic reticulum  has been suggested as a way to improve accumulation levels, due to either the low proteolytic activity in the lumen or the higher folding ability of er resident chaperones
 <cit> . confining amps to the er compartment would be expected to decrease their potential toxicity to the plant cell. moreover, gm rice plants expressing er targeted cecropin a had resistant phenotypes
 <cit> . interestingly, any change in the peptide sequence, such as enlargement, the introduction of hinge sequences, er retention signal, or specific tagging, may affect the biological properties, and this would require a considerable level of screening.

to look at bp <dig> as a proof-of-concept of the possibility of expressing active amps of the bp <dig> series in plants, a number of bp <dig> derivatives were rationally designed to be produced in plants. the possible influence of these sequence modifications on the expected antibacterial activity was experimentally tested using chemically synthesized bp <dig> derivatives and specific bacterial growth inhibition assays. the possibility of producing bp <dig> derivatives with high antimicrobial activity in a plant system was investigated by stable transformation of rice, following a strategy based on constitutive expression and er accumulation. the impact of this type of peptide on the fitness of the host plant was specifically evaluated. we envisage our results will be applicable to other short α-helical cationic peptides with high antimicrobial activity.

RESULTS
rationale of the approach - design of bp <dig> derivatives suitable for expression in gm plants
bp <dig> is a synthetic linear polypeptide with only l-amino acids, which is compatible with standard protein synthesis in plant cells. however, bp <dig> is amidated at the c-terminal position
 <cit> . an unmodified form of bp <dig> was chemically synthesized, retaining the same amino acid sequence. on analysis, it was found to have similar or slightly lower antibacterial activity and hemolytic activity as bp <dig> , so was selected as a model undecapeptide from the cecmel <dig> peptide library for amp production in plants.

antibacterial activity was determined against erwinia amylovora , pseudomonas syringae pv. syryngae  and xanthomonas axonopodis pv.vesicatoria  as reporter species, and against the rice pathogens dickeya chrysanthemi  and fusarium verticillioides .

minimal inhibitory concentrations  are given in μm and were calculated with  <dig> bacterial cfu/ml or  <dig> conidia/ml. phytotoxicity values in rice germination assays are given as minimal peptide concentrations  causing significant alteration of shoot length. phytotoxicity values in tobacco leaf inoculation assays are given as the mean of the lesion diameter  and standard error upon inoculation of 150 μm peptide solutions. letters indicate different groups in one-way anova analysis and tukey's b posttest with α =  <dig> . hemolytic activity is given as the ratio between each peptide and the reference peptide bp <dig> .

the length of the bp <dig> undecapeptide, a short molecule, needs to be increased above a minimum threshold to achieve expression in plant systems. accumulation of this bactericidal peptide in plants could potentially result in bp <dig> degradation by plant proteolytic activities  and/or produce plant cell damage even though cytotoxicity and protease susceptibility were minimized during the bp <dig> selection procedure. this effect is typically diminished in cell compartments such as the er, where optimal yields of recombinant proteins have often been described. five bp <dig> derivative peptides, including up to three copies of bp <dig> in the same or in opposite orientations, were specifically designed for expression in plants and accumulation in the er. the derivatives were  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long .

it has been previously reported
 <cit>  that single amino acid changes in the bp <dig> sequence have a major effect on its biological characteristics. we tested the antibacterial activity of the newly designed bp <dig> derivatives by in vitro growth inhibition of the three model plant pathogen bacteria erwinia amylovora , pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae  and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria . the different modifications incorporated in bp <dig> derivatives designed for expression in plants affected the properties of the resulting peptides . bp <dig> , bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi had similar or higher antibacterial activity compared to bp <dig>  and the increase in activity was higher against xav than against ea and pss. bp <dig> mi was the most active peptide and bp <dig>  and bp <dig>  were the least active bp <dig> derivatives in this assay.

toxicity of bp <dig> derivatives
we initially assessed the possible toxicity to plant producer cells of bp <dig> derivatives by inoculation of chemically synthesized peptides in tobacco leaves in an in planta assay. inoculation of  <dig> to 250 μm bp <dig> , bp <dig> , bp <dig> i, bp <dig>  and bp <dig> mi induced lesions in tobacco leaves in a dose dependent manner , with water as the negative control. the highly cytotoxic peptide mellitin was used as the positive control. bp <dig> derivatives produced similar or moderately larger lesions than bp <dig> , while mellitin clearly produced more severe lesions at the same doses.

further assays were carried out with rice. in a germination test, high concentrations of both bp <dig> and mellitin severely affected seedling development . remarkably, the effects of the two peptides were divergent. mellitin predominantly inhibited root growth while allowing moderate shoot development. in contrast, bp <dig> barely effected root growth but almost completely inhibited shoot development. the phenotypic effects of bp <dig> derivatives were similar to those of bp <dig>  phytotoxic effects were quantified through shoot lengths of seedlings grown in the presence of decreasing concentrations of peptides, and minimal peptide doses causing significantly shorter seedlings were determined . toxic effects were dose dependent. bp <dig>  unmodified bp <dig> and bp <dig>  produced phenotypic effects at 64 μm and higher concentrations . bp <dig>  produced shorter seedlings at 32 μm and higher concentrations ; and bp <dig> i, bp <dig>  and bp <dig> mi were toxic at 16 μm and higher concentrations  .

these results demonstrated that bp <dig> and its derivatives were toxic to plant cells when applied at high doses. the toxicity to mammalian cells of bp <dig> derivatives was tentatively assessed as the ability to lyse erythrocytes in comparison to a potent hemolytic agent, mellitin. as shown in table 
 <dig>  bp <dig> derivatives generally had higher hemolytic activities than bp <dig> , and this activity seemed to increase with peptide length.

effect of bp100der transgenes on the efficiency of transformation
we assessed the feasibility of synthetic amp production in plants using rice as the model, and on the basis of constitutive transgene expression and amp accumulation in the er to protect foreign peptides from potential degradation by proteolytic activities and plant cells from phytotoxic activity of peptides. to get a broad picture of the potential and possible limitations of this approach, all five bp <dig> derivatives were used for transformation, even though they had different characteristics . chimeric genes encoding all five bp <dig> derivatives  were synthesized and used in a series of transformation experiments designed to quantify the efficiency of the process in terms of amounts of transgenic calluses and plants that could be obtained for each bp <dig> derivative. a total of  <dig>  rice calluses were transformed with each amp plasmid and the empty vector, with the hptii selection gene and no bp100der sequence, and the numbers of transgenic calluses were recorded. regeneration and development of transgenic plantlets were also monitored .

absolute numbers and percentages relative to transformation with the control plasmid are given. control transformation data is given in absolute numbers of hygromycin resistant calluses and percentages of transgenic plants, always relative to the previous step.

*a total of  <dig> calluses were transformed with each plasmid in three independent experiments, each including transformation with the control vector. only hygromycin resistant calluses and plants from different calluses  were recorded.

**only  <dig> of the  <dig> control hygromycin resistant calluses were further processed.

transformation with all five bp100der plasmids resulted in growth of hygromycin-resistant transgenic callus. however, we found major differences in the efficiency of the transformation among plasmids with sequences encoding different bp <dig> derivatives. transformation with control plasmids consistently gave the highest numbers of transgenic calluses in our experimental conditions. slightly lower numbers of calluses showing the selection phenotype were obtained with plasmids carrying bp <dig> mi or bp <dig> i, while much reduced numbers of transgenic calluses carrying bp <dig>  and especially bp <dig>  and bp <dig>  were identified.

to confirm the functionality of bp100der transgenes in callus with the selection phenotype, we assessed transgene mrna expression in three randomly chosen transgenic calluses for each construct by rt-qpcr . all analyzed calluses had been subjected to various subculture steps to minimize non-transgenic cells. in a preliminary test we assessed the mrna levels of three reference genes; elongation factor ef1α, β-actin and 18 s rna ribosomal genes. in all our callus samples, β-actin had the best score upon application of the genorm algorithm , so was selected for normalization.

all analyzed calluses expressed both selection marker and  the corresponding bp100der transgenes . as expected, transgene expression levels calculated by comparison to β-actin showed great variation among the different events, with relative standard deviations  of normalized transgene mrna copy numbers of 63% and 117% for hptii and bp100der, respectively. compared to β-actin, the amount of selection gene mrna in gm callus was generally 1- to 10-fold higher, and that of bp100der mrna 10- to 110-fold higher. the hptii selection gene was similarly expressed in transgenic callus transformed with plasmids carrying different bp100der sequences or the empty vector . transgenes encoding distinct bp <dig> derivatives were expressed at statistically similar levels in calluses exhibiting the selection phenotype , although, the lowest bp100der expression values consistently corresponded to bp <dig> .

callus with the hptii selection gene and bp <dig>  grew slowly, suffered necrosis and never regenerated gm plants. although they grew normally, none of the ~20 bp <dig> - transformed hygromycin-resistant calluses achieved plant regeneration, so no gm plants expressing this amp  could be obtained with this approach. in contrast, plant regeneration was possible for control, bp <dig> , bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi transformants , although at decreasing rates. the presence of the bp100der transgene was assessed by qpcr in leaf samples of all regenerated plantlets. two plants, transformed with bp <dig> - and bp <dig> i-containing plasmids, were qpcr negative and were discarded. an additional plant produced a bp100der qpcr product of different melting temperature than expected. sequencing of the insert proved the bp <dig> mi sequence in this event carried a copy of bp <dig> mi with a deletion and was also discarded. finally,  <dig>   <dig> and 8 t <dig> plantlets were obtained which carried the bp <dig> , bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi transgenes, respectively . less than half of these t <dig> plantlets completed acclimatization and were fertile . the capacity of transgenic cells carrying bp100der sequences to grow as callus, regenerate plants, survive greenhouse standard growth conditions and produce viable seeds was visibly inferior to controls with the empty vector. the efficiency of the whole transformation process was only 10% the control for s-bp <dig> , and as low as 2-3% for s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi . we concluded that bp100der had a negative effect on transgenic callus and plants; different bp100der sequences had different degrees of phytotoxicity in specific steps of the transformation process.

molecular and cellular characterization of transgenic plants
a total of fourteen fertile transgenic plants were obtained carrying bp <dig> i , bp <dig>   or bp <dig> mi . as all t <dig> transgenic plants originated from independent calluses, they corresponded to different transformation events. for selection of representative gm events, on the basis of insert copy number and bp100der expression levels, genomic dna extracted from leaf samples of s-bp <dig>  and s-bp <dig> mi mature t <dig> plants was analyzed by qpcr targeting bp100der, hptii and actin, to determine approximate transgene copy numbers. ratios of transgene to actin copy numbers were close to  <dig>  for all events, suggesting they all had single copy insertions. additional leaf samples of the same plants were subjected to rna extraction and rt-qpcr analysis to compare bp100der mrna levels. bp <dig>  was similarly expressed in the nine different s-bp <dig>  events , and bp <dig> mi was expressed at similar levels in all three s-bp <dig> mi events . three events carrying bp <dig>   and two with bp <dig> mi  were selected, in addition to the two events obtained for bp <dig> i .

the seven selected gm events were self-crossed to produce the homozygous t <dig> generation of gm plants: three independent homozygous lines harboring the bp <dig>  transgene and two with each, bp <dig> i and bp <dig>  were obtained. southern blot and qpcr analyses confirmed that all had single copies of the transgene .

transgene expression was assessed by rt-qpcr in leaves of homozygous plants grown under controlled conditions and sampled at the two-leaf stage. three biological replicates of ten plants were analyzed per transgenic event. every transgenic line expressed the corresponding bp100der mrna in their leaves. yields of transgene mrna were calculated by comparison to actin as the reference gene  . as expected, the expression levels of the transgenes varied in the different events: not only copy number but also the integration site is known to influence transgene expression levels
 <cit> .

we then compared transgene expression levels between plants transformed with different bp100der plasmids . s-bp <dig>  and s-bp <dig> i plants expressed higher amounts of bp100der mrna in their leaves than s-bp <dig> mi . hptii mrna levels were similar in transgenic plants transformed with the different plasmids, including those with the empty vector . the presence of bp100der or the specific bp100der incorporated in gm plants did not affect the expression levels of the selection gene.

the bp100der transgenes encode highly cationic peptides and were designed with er signal peptide and retention sequences. accumulation of the bp100der product in the er could affect the morphology of this organelle. s-bp <dig> i. <dig>  s-bp <dig> . <dig>  s-bp <dig> mi. <dig> and senia plants were compared at the ultrastructural level by tem observation of the crown region of seedlings at the two-leaf developmental stage. morphology of the er was clearly altered in s-bp100der cells accompanying vascular cells , with wider and more variable intra-cisternal spaces of er cisternae and an increase in dictysome vesicles. there was no clear morphological disorganization in organelles such as mitochondria  and chloroplasts. an increasing number of vesicles were also formed, particularly in s-bp <dig> mi cells, and an accumulation of numerous electron-dense granules was detected in parenchyma cells of s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig>  .

resistance of gm plants to pathogen infection and tolerance to oxidative stress
an indirect approach was used to obtain evidence of the production of bp <dig> derivative amps in our transgenic rice lines, testing their resistance to infection with the bacterial pathogen dickeya chrysanthemi and the fungus fusarium verticillioides, and tolerance to oxidative stress. seeds from all the homozygous lines obtained were incubated in the presence of d. chrysanthemi and f. verticillioides, and germination was monitored. homozygous plants from all lines were treated with h2o <dig> in detached-leaf assays.

with senia seeds, infection with  <dig> to 106d. chrysanthemi cfu resulted in progressively smaller, brownish roots and shorter shoots, with germination almost completely inhibited at the highest dose. the pathogenic effect of d.chrysanthemiwas estimated using a semi-quantitative scale , and the values recorded seven days after infection ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

we selected 105 cfu  to assess susceptibility of s-bp100der seeds to this pathogenic bacterium. s-bp <dig>  and s-hgr lines had similar sensitivity values as senia , indicating that hptii or bp <dig>  did not significantly modify resistance to this bacterial pathogen. in contrast, s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi lines were more resistant than untransformed plants  , signifying that bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi transgenes decreased rice susceptibility to d.chrysanthemi.

seven days after f. verticillioides inoculation of senia seeds, a cottony mycelium covered the surface of the remaining seed and seedlings showed severe growth effects. the primary embryonic root was shorter than that of uninfected controls, with a brownish tone, and there was little or no crown root production. shoots were shorter in infected seedlings. the f. verticillioides pathogenic effect was estimated through a semi-quantitative index that reflected shoot height and root development .

there were clear differences in the effects of this fungus on plants harboring different transgenes. those transformed with the control plasmid, bp <dig> i and bp <dig>  had major morphology alterations with susceptibility values similar to senia . in contrast, all events harboring bp <dig> mi had long shoots and well developed root systems , which resulted in higher resistance values . this suggested that rice was protected against infection with f. verticillioides by bp <dig> mi transgene but not hptii,bp <dig>  or bp <dig> i.

automated growth curve analysis demonstrated that the presence of bp <dig> derivatives in the culture broth resulted in inhibition of d. chrysanthemi and particularly f. verticillioides growth in a concentration-dependent manner. the mic values for the relevant bp <dig> , bp <dig>  and bp <dig> mi peptides ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and < <dig>  to 5 μm, respectively , which is indicative of their activity against this microorganism.

after treatment with h2o <dig>  senia untransformed leaves had the widest nbt stained leaf surface , indicating accumulation of superoxide radicals . s-hgr rice lines carrying hptii but no bp100der sequences had slightly lower, statistically undistinguishable, nbt staining values . nbt staining was somehow lower in s-bp <dig>  lines , but one-way anova indicated they were similar to s-hgr , suggesting that there was no clear improvement of stress tolerance with the bp <dig>  transgene compared to control leaves. the accumulation of o2- was considerably lower in s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi rice lines than in untransformed and s-hgr control plants  , indicating bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi transgenes resulted in increased tolerance to oxidative stress.

performance of gm rice plants with bp100der transgenes
plants from all s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi homozygous lines obtained in this work were compared with control senia in terms of agronomic parameters. for each line, three replicates of  <dig> plants each were analyzed. growth and yield of control plants were as normal in our culture conditions. no significant differences were found between independent replicates of any particular gm line, and the different lines harboring the same bp100der transgene gave similar values for all studied parameters .

slight differences were observed between control plants and those with different transgenes. s-bp <dig> i plants were shorter than senia , with mean height and standard error values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm, respectively . in contrast, s-bp <dig> mi plants were a similar height to the controls  . all lines had the same amount of tillers per plant . leaf chlorophyll content was measured during plant growth and no significant differences were observed between s-bp <dig> i and senia lines. s-bp <dig> mi exhibited slightly higher values, although they were all in a narrow range  .

the senia control line had better yield, corresponding to the weight of all panicles in a plant, than lines harboring bp100der sequences, and s-bp <dig> mi had better yield than s-bp <dig> i . we refined our yield data by independently considering the number of panicles per plant, number of grains per panicle and grain weight. senia grains were heavier than those of s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig> i lines , although overall differences were in a very narrow range , as expected. as shown in figure 
7b senia, s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi had similar numbers of panicles per plant , but s-bp <dig> mi and especially s-bp <dig> i had less grains per panicle, which explained the lower yields.

complementary experiments were carried out under similar conditions to compare the performance of s-hgr lines  and untransformed senia. a total of  <dig> independent s-hgr events were evaluated. four were statistically undistinguishable from senia in terms of all analyzed parameters. one single s-hgr line had similar chlorophyll contents to senia but it was slightly smaller  and had more tillers . there were more panicles, with fewer grains per panicle but of the same weight as in senia, which gave rise to the same yield as untransformed lines . these were considered event dependent features.

discussion
several synthetic linear undecapeptides of the cecmel <dig> peptide library are of increasing interest for future development of fungicides and bactericides against plant pathogens
 <cit> . the linear peptide bp <dig> is of particular interest due to its properties against major bacterial plant pathogens. biotechnological production of this short, highly positively charged , α-helical amphipathic peptide, which could also damage producing plant cells, is challenging. the aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of expressing transgenes encoding bp100-derived amps in transgenic plants using rice as the model host, particularly focusing on the putative impact on the fitness of the host plant. bp <dig> was used as a model for short cationic amps, which are recognized as a remarkable source of active substances with many different applications in diverse sectors besides plant protection
 <cit> . we established the strategy of transgenic peptide accumulation in er both to minimize the putative toxic effect and to protect it from plant proteases
 <cit> . the length increase was addressed by designing larger peptides based on the bp <dig> sequence.

we found that any modification incorporated in bp <dig> derivatives designed for plant expression altered their properties in terms of antibacterial activity and range of target bacterial species. this is in agreement with previous data on how subtle changes in a peptide sequence of a given length influence antimicrobial activity
 <cit> , and with reports identifying length and sequence among the most relevant factors for biological activity of peptides
 <cit> . it is therefore necessary to assess the biological activity and other relevant properties of any derivative of a given peptide prior to expression in plant systems.

the presence of the c-terminal kdel element does not result in loss of antibacterial activity , which makes the strategy of peptide accumulation in er possible. size increase based on bp <dig> tandem copies did not result in a proportional improvement of activity, but tended to reduce it. in contrast, peptides with two units in inverted orientation  had higher activity than bp <dig> against the three reporter bacteria. this increase was especially relevant against xav, demonstrating that sequence variations had an effect on target specificity, which could be related to membrane composition. in view of the antimicrobial activity of these bp <dig> derivatives, they were considered good candidates to evaluate the possibility of expressing synthetic, highly active antimicrobial peptides in plants.

monitoring the agrobacterium based transformation process showed that bp100der transgene products exerted a toxic effect on constitutively producer plant cells, although bp <dig> has very low toxicity in hemolysis tests
 <cit>  and in a mouse model
 <cit> . the complete transformation process of bp100der genes was undoubtedly inefficient, below 10% of control transformations . parallel transformation with the empty vector was as expected, so excluding technical errors. remarkably, no gm plants were obtained carrying bp <dig>  or bp <dig> , indicating transformation efficiencies of  ≤1% that of the empty vector. amp expression in plants has been accomplished for numerous peptides and host species . large numbers of gm rice events accumulating aspergillus giganteus antifungal protein afp
 <cit>  or cecropine a
 <cit>  have been reported with normal phenotypes. recently, thanathin expression has been reported to have very few harmful effects to host plant cells
 <cit> . however, to our knowledge this is the first report on detailed comparison of transformation efficiencies of different putatively toxic transgenes, as the objective is typically to obtain a few transgenic events and the impact of transgene expression at different stages of gm plant production is not addressed.

not only did transformation with different bp100der sequences have different overall efficiency values but the effectiveness of specific steps during the transformation process varied. as an example, reasonable numbers of calluses harboring bp <dig> mi and bp <dig> i were obtained  whereas only around  <dig> - 40% the expected was obtained with bp <dig>  and bp <dig> . the bp100der transgene mrna levels in callus could partially explain these results, with somewhat higher expression levels  in some way compromising host cell fitness. the number of calluses transformed with bp <dig>  was low and they suffered necrosis while expressing the transgene at the lowest bp100der levels. these phenomena can be interpreted on the basis of the different properties of the specific bp <dig> derivatives: lower levels of bp <dig>  product seem to be more toxic to the host cell than higher levels of other bp100der products.

the number of gm calluses regenerating plants was above 60% that of the control for bp <dig>  but extremely low for bp <dig> mi. in contrast, all regenerated s-bp <dig> mi plants but only one fourth of the s-bp <dig> i plants survived the acclimatization stage, and virtually all s-bp <dig>  plants in the greenhouse produced seeds but less than half s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi developed and were fertile. as the bp100der transgene and mrna were present in all plants obtained, regeneration of plants mainly from transgenic calluses having lost the bp100der transgenes could be discarded. however, for bp <dig> mi only gm plants with low transgene expression levels were viable. diverse bp100der transgene products seem to have different toxic effects on the producing cells, in particular affecting callus growth and capacity to regenerate plants, plant survival and/or development under standard greenhouse conditions. this is in agreement with the different characteristics of chemically synthesized bp <dig> derived peptides. interestingly, length increment based on bp <dig> tandem repeats did not result in a proportional increase in activity but it greatly increased toxicity to the producer cell. this is in contrast to previous reports associating major antibacterial activity of cationic peptides to higher toxicity to eukaryotic cells
 <cit> .

toxicity of bp <dig> derivatives to plant cells was confirmed in rice germination and tobacco leaf inoculation assays by comparison of the highly cytotoxic peptide, mellitin. bp <dig> phytotoxic effects were less intense than those of mellitin and they affected different biological pathways. bp <dig> reduced shoot development in seedlings while root growth was deficient with mellitin. the five bp <dig> derivatives had similar phytotoxic effects to bp <dig> , in some cases with moderately higher intensity. red blood cell-based assays have been used as an approach to estimate peptide toxicity to mammalian cells
 <cit> . the hemolytic activity of the bp <dig> derived peptides was parallel to phytotoxic activity, with a tendency to increase with peptide length even though mellitin is just  <dig> amino acids long. remarkably, toxicity to erythrocytes and plant cells could only be detected upon application of high peptide doses . the mechanism of action of amps such as bp <dig> is based on electrostatic attraction and subsequent interaction with cell membranes
 <cit> . this property has been exploited by using the bp <dig> sequence to internalize fused reporter proteins into eukaryotic cells
 <cit> . differences in membrane lipid composition between bacterial and eukaryotic cells  drastically reduce susceptibility of eukaryotic cells to many cationic peptides
 <cit>  and explains the specific antimicrobial properties of bp <dig> derivatives. biologically synthesized bp100der products are expected to accumulate at lower concentrations than those exerting visible phytotoxicity. phytotoxicity of bp <dig> derivatives could explain the reduced transformation efficiencies of bp100der transgenes. the bp100der products may cause stress in s-bp100der lines, but its expression certainly can be compatible with moderately decreased fitness and increased pathogen resistance phenotypes .

the possibility of obtaining transgenic rice constitutively expressing bp100der transgenes cannot be directly inferred from the capacity to lyse erythrocytes, damage tobacco leaves upon inoculation or affect seedling development. transgenic plants were obtained for expression of bp <dig> derivatives displaying high toxicity values in our assays  but not e.g. bp <dig> , with lower values. exogenous application of peptides at very high concentrations causes these toxic effects, whereas the vulnerability of host plant cells to biologically synthesized bp100der products may differ, as these are produced within the plant cell and are likely to accumulate in a specific cell compartment.

fertile gm lines with a correctly incorporated and constitutively expressed single copy of the transgene were obtained for some bp100der sequences. the specific chemical properties of bp <dig>  make it extremely difficult to detect and purify from plant cellular material. we are currently working on this, but no operative protocols to directly detect bp <dig> derived peptides in plant tissues are yet available. in addition, among the prolific number of reports in the current literature on gm plants expressing amps only a few gave direct confirmation of amp production
 <cit> . nevertheless bp100der mrna expression in gm plants, low transformation efficiencies and other phenotypic evidences  indirectly demonstrate the production of bp <dig> derivative molecules in these transgenic plants.

s-bp100der cells exhibit altered er morphology, with distinct dilation of cisterna and abundant dictysome vesicles. taking into account that bp100der sequences include signal peptide and er retention motifs, these observations agree with synthesis of bp100der products and accumulation in this organelle. additionally, numerous vesicles and electron dense granules were observed in s-bp <dig>  and especially s-bp <dig> mi cells. disruption of the er structure and the presence of increased vesicles or small vacuoles and in some cases, electron dense granules have been associated to exposure of plant cells to excess  levels of heavy metals
 <cit> . this means that these observed morphological characteristics could be related to the cationic nature  and/or toxic character of bp <dig> derivatives. toxicity caused by the expression of bp <dig> mi seems to be higher than that of bp <dig> i.

our indicator bacterial species ea, xav and pss are not pathogens of rice so cannot be used to assess resistance of our gm rice plants. however, several antimicrobial proteins in gm plants have been reported to confer protection against a wide range of abiotic and biotic stress conditions. transgenic expression of the c. annuum antimicrobial protein caamp <dig> in pepper has been shown to confer broad-spectrum resistance against pathogens
 <cit> . in particular, overexpression of cecropin a in rice has been shown to be effective against the fungal blast m. grisea <cit>  and other conditions such as oxidative stress
 <cit> . expression of chimerical peptides including cecropin a has been found to give gm potatoes broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity
 <cit> , and other cationic α-helical peptides, such as the msra <dig> derivative of dermaseptin b <dig> from phyllomedusa bicolor, have been reported to confer resistance to a variety of fungal and bacterial phytopathogens in transgenic potato plants
 <cit> .

activity of chemically synthesized bp <dig>  bp <dig> , bp <dig> i and bp <dig> mi peptides against the soft rot pathogen d. chrysanthemi  was dose-dependent. although they are mainly antibacterial, bp <dig> derivatives additionally exhibited antifungal activity against f. verticillioides, associated with the bakanae disease of rice
 <cit> . this correlated well with the increased resistance of s-bp <dig> mi lines to f. verticillioides and s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig> i lines to d. chrysanthemi. biotic and abiotic stresses are typically associated with the rapid production of reactive oxygen species , including h2o <dig> and o2-. ros are known to play dual roles; they play a central role in the regulation of biological processes such as stress response, hormone signaling and development, but high ros levels have been implicated in the damaging effects of various environmental stresses
 <cit> . s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig> i vegetative tissues subjected to oxidative stress showed decreased accumulation of o2- radicals, suggesting an increased ability to scavenge ros. overexpression of bp <dig> mi and bp <dig> i led to enhanced resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogens; and improved tolerance to oxidative stress.

the resistant phenotype of s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig> i was not solely an outcome of the selection gene and/or the transformation itself as shown by  the different susceptibility phenotypes exhibited by s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi lines; and  the lack of resistance of untransformed senia and the gm s-hgr and, unexpectedly, s-bp <dig>  lines. chemically synthesized bp <dig>  was active against our indicator bacterial species, d. chrysanthemi and f. verticillioides, but bp <dig>  was the less phytotoxic bp100der transgene. taking into account its extremely small length , we can speculate that this bp <dig> derivative was rapidly degraded in s-bp <dig>  plants and/or produced in a modified form .

the expression of foreign genes in plants can trigger the activation of plant defense mechanisms normally activated only during pathogenesis
 <cit> . several resistant gm rice lines such as those constitutively expressing cecropin a
 <cit> , the antifungal protein afp
 <cit>  or a pathogenesis-related  protein
 <cit>  have been reported to overexpress endogenous defense genes in the absence of the pathogen. this means we cannot rule out transgene dependent overexpression of stress genes being the cause of the resistance phenotypes observed in s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi lines. however, reverse transcription coupled to real-time pcr analyses of pr1b and pr <dig> coding genes [genbank: u <dig>  x <dig>  widely used indicators of induction of plant defense responses
 <cit> ] showed they were expressed at similar levels in leaves of s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi gm when compared to senia in vitro grown plants. additionally, plants overexpressing transgenes encoding er driven proteins have been reported to constitutively express the unfolded protein response , activated by misfolded protein accumulation in the er
 <cit> . the upr has recently been associated to plant resistance to abiotic stress and pathogen attacks , so the accumulation of transgene products  in er could result in increased-resistance phenotypes. in a preliminary experiment we showed that s-bp <dig> mi and s-bp <dig> i were somewhat resistant to the causative agent of rice blast m. grisea, while we could not detect clear in vitro activity of the corresponding peptides against m. grisea spores . s-bp <dig> i and s-bp <dig> mi pathogen resistant and oxidative stress-tolerant phenotypes support the expression of active antimicrobial peptides in these plants, irrespective of whether these phenotypes are peptide-direct effects or indirectly derived from transgene dependent activation of other cellular pathways. the latter seems to have a role in s-bp <dig> i decreased susceptibility to f. verticillioides, taking into account that bp <dig> mi and bp <dig> i have similar mic values against this pathogen, whereas evidence from ultrastructural analysis and mrna expression suggest the bp <dig> mi product exerts higher toxicity on host cells than the bp <dig> i product.

although with low efficiency, we showed the feasibility of producing rice lines expressing at least some bp100der sequences  and indirectly demonstrated the production of bp <dig> derivative molecules. thorough assessment of agronomic characteristics showed the nutritional status of these gm plants was unaffected by bp100der transgenes, as demonstrated by leaf chlorophyll content: chlorophyll content has been directly related to nitrogen content, which is considered an indicator of plant nutritional status. although s-bp <dig> i plants were around 10% shorter than expected, the greatest reduction in the measured parameters was the number of grains per panicle in gm  compared to control lines. it is well known that stress conditions have an effect on the numbers of grains per panicle, so it could be speculated that this was a consequence of the phytotoxic effect of bp <dig> derivative accumulation in plant cells. the slight reduction in grain weight is in agreement with it being a well conserved character under different cultural conditions. despite this, the overall performance of rice lines expressing certain bp100der transgenes strongly resembled comparable untransformed lines. the best case was s-bp <dig> mi, with similar vegetative features and only around 10% grain yield losses compared to senia.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that transformation of rice with genes encoding α-helical cationic amps such as those derived from the synthetic  <dig> amino acids-long bp <dig> had, in many cases, a highly negative effect on the efficiency of transformation. remarkably, gm lines constitutively expressing certain bp100der sequences were produced with resistance phenotypes and minimal impact on agronomic performance. bp <dig> tandem copies could not be constitutively expressed in gm plants, but sequences encoding bp <dig> inverted repeats either elongated or not with portions of a natural amp  greatly diminished transgene undesired effects. it is likely that gm plants constitutively expressing bp100der transgenes and displaying resistance to representative plant pathogens and fit phenotypes are the result of a complex equilibrium between bp100der product phytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and transgene-dependent plant stress response. this approach could be considered feasible for expressing synthetic amps in plants either to establish disease resistant plants or to facilitate molecular farming.
