BACKGROUND
cyclic 3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate  is a key intracellular signaling molecule, which main function is to activate the camp-dependent protein kinases   <cit> . pka is a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two regulatory  and two catalytic  subunits, which is enzymatically inactive in the absence of camp. when two molecules of camp bind to each of the r subunits  <cit> , the c subunits are released and activated to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on specific intracellular target proteins  <cit> . several pka substrates have been identified of which the synthetic peptide kemptide  <cit>  and the naturally occurring substrate camp responsive element binding protein  are of the best characterized  <cit> . in primates, four genes encoding the r subunit and four genes encoding the c subunit, have been identified and designated riα, riβ, riiα, riiβ and cα, cβ, cγ and x-chromosome encoded protein kinase x   <cit> .

whereas no splice variants for riβ and riiβ have been described, riα is transcribed from at least two different promoters. the first exons of the riα gene, exon 1a and 1b, give rise to alternatively spliced but identical proteins riα1a and riα1b  <cit> . riα 1a and 1b mrnas have been identified in most tissues and are differentially regulated by camp  <cit> . in the case of rii, it has been shown that riiα in the human testis but no other tissues examined, is encoded with an alternative amino-terminal region  <cit> . no functional consequences of alternative splicing of ri and rii have been reported.

several splice variants are transcribed from the cα and the cβ genes  and include cα <dig>  cαs, cβ <dig>  cβ <dig>  cβ <dig> and cβ <dig>  in addition to an unknown number of abc forms of the cβ <dig> and cβ <dig> variants  <cit> . the major differences between the various c subunits are introduced through alternative use of exon  <dig> in the prkcb and prkca genes, respectively  <cit> . in the case of cα <dig> exon 1- <dig> encodes an n-terminal stretch of  <dig> amino acids that have three sites that undergo co- and posttranslational modifications. at the very n-terminus a gly is located that undergoes myristoylation in vivo  <cit> . c-terminal to the gly an asn is located that is partly deamidated in vivo leading to cα1-asp <dig> and cα1-isoasp <dig>  <cit> . the third modification is pka-autophosphorylation at ser <dig>  <cit> . in the case of cβ <dig>  exon 1- <dig> encodes an n-terminal stretch of  <dig> amino acids that does not harbor sites for any of the modifications identified in cα <dig>  instead, the cβ <dig> n-terminus contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that form an amphiphatic α-helix displayed as a hydrophobic surface  <cit> . cα <dig> and cβ <dig> are more than 90% identical at the amino acid level and are ubiquitously expressed. cαs has only been identified in sperm cells  <cit> , cβ <dig> is predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells  <cit> , and cβ <dig> and cβ <dig> and their abc variants are mainly expressed in neuronal tissues  <cit> .

it is assumed that any known c subunit may associate with ri and rii to form pkai and pkaii, respectively  <cit> . this has raised the question of the biological significance of pkai and ii holoenzymes containing various c isoforms within the same cell. whereas no reports have been published on the functional consequences of holoenzymes formed with various c subunits, it has been demonstrated that several cell types expressing riα are highly proliferative and may also be associated with malignancy  <cit> . using a genetic approach it has also been demonstrated that constitutive ablation of riα but not riβ is prenatal lethal whereas ablation of the rii variants results in more discrete defects, affecting differentiation of adipose tissue and neural functions <cit> . the levels of ri and rii as well as tissue- and subcellular expression varies. they also show differential affinities for a-kinase anchoring proteins . furthermore, when determining the structure of the pka holoenzymes it was found that ri and rii contact the substrate binding site of the c subunit either as a true pka substrate  or as a pseudosubstrate  due to autophosphorylation of rii but not ri at ser <dig>  <cit> . despite these differences an explanation for biological differences at the cellular level between ri and rii are not fully appreciated  <cit> . however, it should be noted that rii autophosphorylation modulates akap-rii interaction in cardiac cells, leading to altered down-stream substrate phosphorylation and ca2+ dynamics  <cit> .

to investigate biological differences between ri and rii and to demonstrate if such differences are dependent on c subunit identity we formed pkai and pkaii by co-transfecting 293t cells with either riα or riiα together with cα <dig> and cβ <dig>  respectively. this demonstrated that pkai was superior to pkaii in activating a camp responsive element regardless of whether the holoenzyme contained cα <dig> or cβ <dig>  our results contribute to understand the functional significance of two pka holoenzymes but not various c subunits expressed in the same cell.

RESULTS
to test for differential roles of pkai and pkaii expressed in one cell we tested if markedly different c subunits released from ri and rii are equally effective in regulating in vivo substrate phosphorylation. we chose the cell line 293t as a model system since they express riα and riiα associated with cα <dig> , and not riβ and riiβ . in these cells pkai and pkaii are distinctly located to the cytosol and golgi-centrosomal area, respectively as demonstrated by immunostaining using anti-riα  or anti-riiα  . co-immunostaining with anti-c demonstrated that cα <dig> localization corresponded to r subunit localization. we also observed a weak nuclear staining of the c subunit in the absence of camp , whereas in the presence of the camp analogue, 8-cpt-camp  an increase in nuclear staining was observed . we concluded that the 293t cells represented a suitable model system to study isoform differences between pkai and pkaii formed with different c subunits.

to obtain 293t cells dominated by either pkai or pkaii expression, we formed holoenzymes by transient transfection of plasmids over-expressing either riα or riiα  in combination with either cα <dig> or cβ <dig> . for some experiments the cells were also transfected with a vector expressing luciferace controlled by a camp responsive element. c subunit activity was tested in vitro using kemptide as a substrate  <cit> ; and in vivo using the cre-luciferase reporter system  <cit> . this revealed a dose-dependent increase in pka-specific catalytic activity against kemptide for both pdecα <dig> and pdecβ <dig> with a maximum at  <dig> ng dna . the luciferase response was bell shaped and reached a maximum for pdecα <dig> and pdecβ <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> ng dna, respectively . next, we titrated the plasmids expressing ri and rii by transfecting 0- <dig> ng of the plasmids pderiα and pexriiα, respectively .

twenty four hours after transfection cells were lysed and r subunit levels were measured by immunoblotting and -camp-binding. this revealed an increase in a  <dig> kda immunoreactive band as well as increased -camp-binding that coincided with the amount of plasmid transfected . the same was the case when transfecting pexriiα . together this demonstrated a dose-dependent expression of both riα and riiα.

based on these transfections and earlier experiments , we next formed pka holoenzymes by r and c co-transfections. we aimed at transfecting r plasmids to levels where c activity in the absence of camp were at basal levels, implying levels of r able to associate with all c subunits. 293t cells were co-transfected with a fixed amount of either pdecα <dig>  or pdecβ <dig>  together with increasing amounts of pderiα  and pexriiα , respectively. cell extracts were adjusted to  <dig> mg total protein/ml and total c subunit activity measured in the presence and absence of  <dig>  μm camp. this demonstrated that cα1-specific kinase activity was inhibited down to basal levels in the absence of camp at  <dig> ng pderiα , which was equal to  <dig> ±  <dig>  pmol riα/mg total protein . in the case of cβ2-specific activity it was down to basal levels in the absence of camp at  <dig> ng pderiα  which was equal to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol riα/mg total protein . for riiα,  <dig> ng pexriiα was required for optimal cα <dig> inhibition , which was equal to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol riiα/mg total protein . finally,  <dig> ng pexriiα was required to inhibit cβ <dig> activity to basal levels  which was equal to  <dig>  ±  <dig> pmol riiα/mg total protein. in order to compare in vitro and in vivo pka activity, protein extracts were analyzed against kemptide phosphorylation and luciferace activity after transfection with cage-cre-luciferase  together with either  <dig> ng pdecα <dig> or  <dig> ng pdecβ <dig> and increasing amounts of pderiα and pexriiα . in these experiments psv-β-galactosidase  was used for normalization . this showed that luciferase activity induced by cα <dig> and cβ <dig> was completely inhibited by both riα and riiα at doses above or equal to  <dig> ng plasmid dna.

* concentration of r subunit  required for 100% inhibition of cα <dig> and cβ <dig> activity.

the experiments in figures  <dig> and  <dig> depict that cβ <dig> activity is fully inhibited at lower amounts of r than cα <dig> is. this may imply that cα <dig> is enzymatically more active than cβ <dig> or simply that cβ <dig> is more unstable than cα <dig> in the absence of r. a previous report shows that the c subunit in its free active form is more rapidly degraded than c complexed with the r subunit dimer  <cit> . to test if cα <dig> and cβ <dig> display differential stability, identical amounts of cα <dig> and cβ <dig> plasmids were transfected alone or with  <dig> ng of pderiα. this confirmed  that in the absence of riα total cβ <dig> activity is significantly  lower compared to cα <dig>  this was not the case when riα was co-transfected with the two c subunits. in this case both cα <dig> and cβ <dig> activities were increased, however, to comparable levels after stimulation with camp . this demonstrated that riα has a stabilizing effect on both c subunits. however the effect was more pronounced for cβ <dig> than cα <dig> indicating that cβ <dig> is more unstable than cα <dig> in the absence of r.

the results from figures  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrated that we had obtained cell systems dominated by either pkai or pkaii. hence, the effects of pkai and pkaii on in vitro  and in vivo  phosphorylation could be tested. for these experiments we used amounts of riα and riiα required for complete inhibition of cα <dig> and cβ <dig> respectively.

after  <dig> hours cell extracts were diluted to  <dig> mg total protein/ml and analyzed for camp dose-dependent induction of pka kinase activity against kemptide . both riα and riiα were able to inhibit cα <dig> and cβ <dig> kinase activity completely in the absence of camp. when increasing the concentrations of camp from  <dig> to  <dig> nm, kinase activity was peaking, in the case of cα <dig> at  <dig> nm camp when co-expressed with riα and between  <dig> and  <dig> nm when co-expressed with riiα. in the case of cβ <dig>  maximum activity was achieved at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> nm camp when co-expressed with both riα and riiα. we further analyzed c subunit activity in vivo by measuring luciferace activity. activity was measured after stimulation of the transfected cells with increasing concentrations of 8-cpt-camp  for  <dig> hour prior to harvesting. we observed that activity associated with cα <dig> and cβ <dig> released from both riα and riiα increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching maximum between  <dig> and  <dig> μm 8-cpt-camp . however, a more than two fold higher activity was observed against creb when cα <dig> and cβ <dig> were released from riα than from riiα. together these results indicated that the ability of c to phosphorylate nuclear substrates in vivo at saturating concentrations of camp when associated with pkaii was lower than when associated with pkai. this was apparent despite that total c subunit activity in vitro was comparable and protein concentrations were equal . since these results were seen regardless of c subunit isoform we suspected that the differences observed were associated with r subunit identity. to quantify the different efficacy of pkai and pkaii to phosphorylate creb in vivo, we therefore co-transfected pderiα  and pexriiα  with cα <dig>  and monitored -camp binding. this showed equal activities  and hence comparable levels  revealed as  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig>  pmol per mg total protein of riα and riiα, respectively. we next determined c subunit activity in vitro after transfecting cells as described in figure 7a, and in the absence  and presence of two concentrations of camp . this revealed basal activity in the absence, and low level activity in the presence of  <dig> nm camp whereas  <dig> nm camp resulted in comparable high levels of total c subunit activity released from both pkai and pkaii . the c activities were equal to  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pmol cα <dig> per mg total protein for pkai and pkaii, respectively . this concluded that pkai and pkaii were expressed at comparable levels under the present conditions. the latter was substantiated by a calculated r to c ratio close to  <dig> for both riα versus cα <dig>  and riiα versus cα <dig> .

* concentration of r and c subunit  were determined at saturating concentrations of camp and assuming two camp binding sites per r subunit and  <dig> pmol phosphate transferred by pure bovine c per min per mg  <cit> .

in lymphoid cells, it has been demonstrated that r subunits are more stable in the holoenzyme form compared to the free r subunit  <cit> . to test if the presence of cα <dig> alone and in conjunction with camp would influence r subunit levels we transfected 293t cells with either pderiα  or pexriiα  alone or in conjunction with pdecα <dig> . transfected cells were treated without  or with incremental doses  of 8-cpt-camp for four hours before harvesting. equal amounts of cell extracts  were analyzed for proteins immunoreactive to anti-riα and anti-riiα, respectively. figure 7c shows that 8-cpt-camp stimulation appeared not to influence r subunit levels and thus the camp sensitivity of the system.

based on our observations , we transfected cells as described in figure 7b with equal amounts of pkai and pkaii and monitored luciferace activity after stimulation with two concentrations of 8-cpt-camp  for  <dig> hour before harvesting. as depicted in figure 7d  <dig> μm 8-cpt-camp induced more than a 13-fold increase in luciferace activity when associated with riα compared to untreated cells. when associated with riiα the induction was 3-fold. this difference was reflected in a relative induction of luciferace activity which was nearly twice as high for pkai compared to pkaii .

discussion
despite that pkai and pkaii are located to different areas when expressed in the same cell, it is believed that when dissociated by camp, the c subunits are all released to phosphorylate relevant substrates both in the cytosol and nucleus  <cit> . we formed pkai and pkaii holoenzymes by co-transfecting 293t cells with riα or riiα together with either cα <dig> or cβ <dig> 

we found that c subunits, irrespective of isoform, appeared more efficient in inducing cre-luciferase when released from pkai than pkaii.

to monitor total pka activity in vitro and in vivo we applied camp and the camp analogue 8-cpt-camp. in vitro activation of pka by camp was done to monitor if we had achieved comparable amounts of pkai and pkaii in our experiments. for monitoring in vivo endogenous activity 8-cpt-camp was used because it has cell membrane permeable properties and is resistant to phosphodiesterase degradation  <cit> . the observation that cells transfected with pkai induced higher levels of luciferace activity upon 8-cpt-camp stimulation than cells transfected with pkaii may have been due to relative affinities of the camp analogue. we consider this unlikely since 8-cpt-camp is a b-site selective camp analogue with higher affinity for rii than ri  <cit> . further support for 8-cpt-camp as a competent activator of pkaii in vivo is found in that the concentration of 8-cpt-camp used is capable of displacing the c subunit from the rii subunit interacting with the centrosome in vivo in u2os cells  <cit> . taken together we conclude that 8-cpt-camp is fully capable to activate pkaii and does not selectively activate pkai, implying that pkaii is less potent compared with pkai in inducing cre-luciferase activity.

an explanation for the biological significance of the phenomenon observed may rely on several factors. despite that 25% of pka is undissociated even in the presence of saturating concentrations of camp  <cit>  it may not account for the differences we observed since this is observed for both pkai and pkaii. however, it has been demonstrated that camp-dissociated rii and c reassociate much faster and to a much greater extent than ri and c. in fact it has been suggested that c does not really leave rii under physiological conditions due to a rapid reassociation  <cit> . hence, incomplete dissociation of c subunit from rii even at saturating concentrations of camp could be a mechanism explaining the phenomena observed here. moreover, the biological significance of differential effects of activating pkai and pkaii independent of c subunit identity may be multiple. recently a paper by di and co-workers  <cit>  demonstrated that pkai and pkaii define distinct intracellular signaling compartments. they demonstrated that pkai and pkaii activity were regulated by distinct, spatially restricted camp signals generated in response to specific g protein-coupled receptors and which were regulated by unique subsets of the camp degrading phosphodiesterases.

we observed that cα <dig> was more active than cβ <dig> when expressed in non-holoenzyme form. this may suggest differential kd of cα <dig> and cβ <dig> against ri and rii. this suggestion was supported in that the amount of r plasmid required for complete inhibition of cα <dig> and cβ <dig>  respectively, was higher for ri compared to rii regardless of c subunit identity . however, we also observed that cβ <dig>  but not cα <dig> activity was stabilized when co-transfecting with the r subunit implying that the differences observed is due to protein instability of the cβ <dig> subunit and not lower kd for the r subunit.

the latter is supported by the observation that r and c dissociation by camp in vivo promotes degradation of c subunits through posttranslational mechanisms which may involve proteasome action  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that cα <dig> and cβ <dig> have identical kd values for ri  <cit> . to what extent cβ <dig> is more sensitive to proteasome degradation than cα <dig> is not known. it should however be noted that the marked differences between the cα <dig> and cβ <dig> at the n-terminus has been implicated in c subunit stability. for cα <dig> it has been demonstrated that the α-helix and trp  <dig> are vital moieties for cα <dig> stability. this correlates with the location of the n-terminal at the cleft interface where it orients the c-helix in the small lobe and the activation loop in the large lobe so that these subdomains are aligned in a way that allows for correct configuration of residues at the active site  <cit> . moreover, we did not demonstrate a relative difference in potency of cβ <dig> versus cα <dig> in inducing cre-luciferase activity irrespective of association with riα or riiα. the latter may suggest that cα <dig> and cβ <dig> behave identically in regulating cre-luciferase activities. hence, we concluded that the differential effects of pkai and pkaii on luciferase activity detected in the present work are associated with r subunit but not c subunit. the latter was unexpected since it has been speculated if the marked sequence differences at the n-terminus will influence pka holoenzyme features as such as localization. the latter has previously been demonstrated in that the n-terminus of cα <dig> is implicated in subcellular anchoring to a-kinase interacting protein  <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, at the n-terminal end the myristoyl moiety, which binds to a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the large lobe when cα <dig> subunit is in the holoenzyme form  <cit> , is exposed to the surroundings upon binding to rii. this makes the holoenzyme more hydrophobic  <cit> . in addition, whereas the n-terminal asn moiety, is involved in fine-tuning of the enzyme distribution within the cell in vivo  <cit> , ser <dig> phosphorylation is known to introduce electro statically mediated forces which may help c to remain soluble even when myristoylated  <cit> . together this implies the n-terminal of cα <dig> to contribute to regulation and tuning of subcellular targeting. despite lack of experimental evidence the n-terminal amphiphatic α-helix in cβ <dig> has been proposed to function as a targeting domain for cβ <dig> in vivo  <cit> . despite the obvious differences between cα <dig> and cβ <dig> we did not observe any experimental evidence on the c subunits contributing to understand the differential effects of pkai and pkaii.

in perspective, the various reports referred to here  <cit>  together with our observations demonstrate differential activities and regulation by pkai and pkaii which may add to understand the biological significance of two pka holoenzymes expressed in one cell.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is important because it points to how tissue-dependent expression of genes encoding subunits of pka achieve specificity in the camp signaling pathway. our work shows that transfected pkai holoenzymes are more efficient than pkaii in phosphorylating cre elements in vivo regardless of c subunit identity. furthermore we show that cβ <dig> appear more stable in the presence of r subunit than cα <dig>
