BACKGROUND
cleavage and polyadenylation  are essential steps in eukaryotic mrna formation that can effect transcript stability and function  <cit> . processing of the 3'-end occurs on the nascent pre-mrna as it is transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . selection of the 3'-processing site is directed by interactions between the polyadenylation machinery and cis-acting elements found both upstream and downstream of the 3'-processing site. the principle upstream cis-acting element is the highly conserved aauaaa hexamer, which interacts with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor  and is found in the majority of metazoan transcripts  <cit> . putative downstream elements  include the functional binding site of the 64-kda subunit of cleavage stimulation factor   <cit> . interactions between cpsf and cstf, as well as polya polymerase  and cleavage factors i and ii  are minimal essential requirements for in vitro polyadenylation  <cit> .

the dse – one or two parts?
unlike the upstream aauaaa signal, whose description has remained largely unchanged since its discovery in  <dig>  <cit> , the dse has had several descriptions. the dse was initially characterized by conserved sequence patterns downstream of the 3'-processing site, resulting in estimated consensus sequences of uuuucacugc  <cit> , guguug  <cit> , and cayug  <cit> . two interesting early studies manipulated downstream sequences in test plasmids to produce a bipartite model of the dse  <cit> , consisting of a proximal ug-rich sequence and a distal u-rich element that act synergistically  <cit> . further characterization of the dse by deletion or substitution assays revealed uguguuggaa  <cit> , yguguuyy  <cit> , agguuuuuu  <cit>  and uuuuu  <cit>  as elements actively involved with directing the polyadenylation event in specific transcripts and/or test systems. rna binding assays indicated that cstf- <dig> interacts with uuuu with a spacing of 15– <dig> nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site  <cit> .

the u-rich description was later challenged by selex binding assays performed on cstf- <dig> by two independent groups. beyer et al used complete cstf complexes in cell extracts, and reported three distinct patterns: augcguuccucgucc, yguguyn0–4uuyayugygu, and uugyun0–4auuuacun0–2ycu  <cit> . takagaki and manley used a recombinant form of cstf- <dig> that included only the rna recognition motif  and found preferred binding to a sequence that included both gu-rich 2–4g) and u-rich 2–4) components  <cit> .

statistical analysis of the dse from information obtained from genomic alignments of d. melanogaster ests implicated the hexamers uguuuu, uguguu and uuuuuu as dses  <cit> . other studies involving genomic alignments of mammalian 3'-utrs or ests reported only u-rich elements with no apparent consensus  <cit> , a pentamer with at least  <dig> us or 2gu/u  <cit> , or the heptamer ugugugu  <cit> . an nmr solution of the vertebrate cstf- <dig> rrm structure was used to demonstrate binding to either  <dig> or 4ug, with a preference for the latter  <cit> . through the wide variety of studies published to date, no clear consensus for the dse has been demonstrated. in fact, the authors of the computational studies cited above argued against the existence of a single consensus. review articles typically refer to a single ug-/u-rich dse, in spite of the early evidence for two independent elements  <cit> .

the present study was initiated to expand our understanding of the 3'-processing regulatory dse sequences through a statistical survey that covers large sets of sequences across a broad phylogenetic range of metazoans. in addition, we also obtained and aligned multiple cstf- <dig> protein sequences for these same organisms, with the goal of identifying correlated changes in protein and probable nucleic acid binding sequences.

RESULTS
description of the datasets
we constructed a 3'-processing site sequence database  from  <dig> , <dig> ests and  <dig> metazoan species including anopheles gambiae , caenorhabditis elegans , canis familiaris , danio rerio , drosophila melanogaster , gallus gallus , homo sapiens , mus musculus , rattus norvegicus , and takifugu rubripes . the numbers of non-redundant and high quality polyadenylation sites included in our analysis ranged from  <dig> in d. melanogaster to  <dig>  in h. sapiens . the quality of our training data was inferred from the presence of the well-documented canonical cpsf binding hexamer aauaaa located up to  <dig> bases upstream of the processing site. the positional word count  distribution for aauaaa peaks at position - <dig> relative to the 3'-processing site in vertebrates and shifts to - <dig> in a. gambiae, - <dig> in d. melanogaster and - <dig> in c. elegans . invertebrates demonstrated a reduced fidelity for the canonical hexamer compared to vertebrates, with the aauaaa hexamer percentage falling markedly. the percentage of sequences with the aauaaa hexamer is consistent with previous reports  <cit>  and ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the vertebrates and  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the invertebrates . we also tested for the presence of the most common variant, auuaaa, and finally for any single base subsitution variant of the canonical hexamer . since the measured frequencies are in good agreement with previous results, we believe that the bulk of our sequences represent bona fide 3'-processing sites.

positioning patterns of tetramers in the dse region
our initial pwc analysis of the dse region was based on tetramers. while tetramers cannot unambiguously define the functional elements, they efficiently indicate positioning trends, as shown below. pwc probabilities for groups of tetramers with distinct, non-uniform positioning patterns are displayed in figure  <dig>  we display a subset of the tetramers, grouping words in the separate panels based on similar positioning and sequence content. the focus of the pwc analysis on positioning makes it immediately clear that there are at least three distinct patterns apparent downstream of the 3'-processing site.

the three patterns apparent in  can be approximately defined as  a ug-rich element positioned 5– <dig> nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing sites ,  a u-rich element positioned 15– <dig> nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site , and  a g-rich element positioned over  <dig> nucleotides downstream of the 3'-processing site. pwc results for all tetramers in the downstream region are available as a supplemental table  <cit> . the most robust pattern, in terms of frequency of occurrence across all sequences and organisms is the u-rich element , which has a strong positional bias in all species with maximum frequencies at positions  <dig> to  <dig> nt downstream of the processing site for the vertebrates and  <dig> to  <dig> for the invertebrates  the maximum positioning of the u-rich tetramers in d. melanogaster and a. gambiae are at positions  <dig> and  <dig> nt respectively and correlates with the 5' shift of the aauaaa hexamer also seen in these species. u-rich tetramers in c. elegans cover a broadened range between  <dig> to  <dig> nt downstream of the processing site.

examination of the data represented in figures 2a, 2c, and  <dig> reveals significant variation in the ug-rich element between different species. for example, a comparison of figures 2a and 2c indicates that variants of the ug-rich element with a g to c transversion  have the same positioning indicating an acceptable functional substitution in all vertebrates, but not invertebrates.  c. elegans apparently does not have a ug-rich element based on the lack of significant positioning bias in either figures 2a or 2c. it is also worth noting that both the positioning and the relative occurrence of the ug-rich element  changes in the arthropods compared to the vertebrates . the g-rich tetramers  appear to be a feature of only the amniote  3'-processing sites.

delineating the dse sequence content
while a tetramer-based pwc analysis clearly shows the positioning dependency of various sequence words, as noted above, it does not unambiguously describe the functional elements that produce the observed word distributions. detailed delineation of rna regulatory motifs is non-trivial, however, as while rna elements are often defined by both sequence content and positioning, the standard computational pattern detection tools  <cit>  typically consider only sequence content, with little or no weight given to positioning. pattern recognition algorithms  typically identify motifs as the patterns that most significantly stand out from the background implied by the surrounding sequence. one exception to this is the improbizer  <cit> , which models positioning according to a normal distribution.

while this is an improvement, examination of figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicates that a normal distribution will only roughly approximate the observed positioning. we analyzed the  <dig> nucleotides downstream of our putative 3'-processing sites with a number of tools, including the gibbs recursive sampler  <cit> , meme  <cit> , the improbizer  <cit> , and a hexamer-based pwc analysis. where necessary, we post-processed the results to include delineation of positioning distribution. we present the results of the gibbs sampler analysis here, whereas the other results are available in the online supplement  <cit> .

the gibbs sampler operates probabilistically, and can produce variable results upon repeated restarts. in addition, the large size of a number of our data sets  necessitated the selection of a random subset of the training sequences in order for the program to run in a reasonable time. a representative sampling of the gibbs sampler results is shown in figure  <dig>  using sequence logos  <cit>  to represent of the sequence content, and line plots to represent the positioning distribution. these results are presented with the caveat that we specifically selected results that most closely reproduce the positioning patterns observed in the pwc analysis. results from at least ten independent runs of each data set  are available in our online supplement  <cit> .

the gibbs sampler routinely identified the ug-rich element in all species except c. elegans , with positioning distributions often consistent with the patterns identified for ug-rich sequences in the pwc tetramer analysis . however, in several cases  the positioning distribution appeared to be a mixture of both the ug- and u-rich elements, likely indicating an overly "greedy" pattern description that encompassed both elements. characterization of the u-rich element proved more elusive. since our sequences are, in general, very u-rich, we could only identify u-rich motifs through either the use of a prior specification or by reducing the weight of the input sequence set in determining the background model. with these adjustments, we were able to characterize u-rich elements, such as those shown as motif  <dig> for nearly all organisms in figure  <dig> 

consistent with the pwc tetramer analysis , the gibbs sampler frequently identified far downstream g-rich motifs , but only for amniotes. in contrast, the fish and arthropod far downstream regions produced an a-rich element, such as shown as motif  <dig> for d. rerio, a. gambiae, and c. elegans.

determining the dse motif length
the gibbs sampler can vary the motif size , selecting the length that produces the most statistically significant result. the gibbs sampler and improbizer consistently returned motifs between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in length, whereas meme typically identified motifs between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides. examination of the meme results  revealed that the extended motifs resembled a concatenation of the ug- and u-rich elements that was dominated by either a strong ug-rich component in the first half or strong u-rich component in the second half. in addition, we also tested the fragmentation option of the gibbs sampler , which allows the detection of non-contiguous patterns, under the constraint that the positioning between blocks must be fixed . nearly all runs of all sequence sets resulted in contiguous motifs.

analysis of the cstf- <dig> rrm multiple alignment
the cstf- <dig> rrm  follows the well-conserved fold structure found in many other rna-binding proteins . residues of β-strands one and three make up canonical motifs of rnp <dig> and rnp <dig> respectively, and are part of the larger rrm structure β1α1β2β3α2β <dig> . the vertebrate cstf- <dig> rrm is terminated by an additional α-helix  that lies across the β-sheet, occluding the projected rna binding site  <cit> . the residues for the entire region spanning r <dig> through g <dig>  are completely conserved in vertebrates, except for the single residue substitution of p <dig> → l <dig> in fish. this near perfect conservation does not extend to invertebrates where numerous residue substitutions can be found. across the same span of residues, percent identities between a. gambiae, d. melanogaster, and c. elegans and the vertebrate sequence are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.  the substitutions are not uniformly distributed. if we restrict our analysis to only the β-sheet , the percent identities increase to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. in contrast, the fifteen amino acids in helix c are much more variable, with percent identities of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and 40%, respectively, and c. elegans also has a single amino acid insertion.

we further restricted our analysis to the amino acids previously identified as contributing to interactions between helix c and the β-sheet  or between the β-sheet and bound rna . in table  <dig>  we list the subset for which changes are observed in the invertebrates.

while the percent identity of helix c is higher in c. elegans than for either a. gambiae or d. melanogaster, the substitutions in c. elegans are arguably more significant. chou-fasman α-helix and β-sheet propensities indicate that the s <dig> → g <dig>  e <dig> → g <dig> and k <dig> → g <dig> substitutions possibly prevent a stable helix c from forming in c. elegans. in addition, the vertebrate helix c includes three conserved lysines, all of which are oriented with their side chains pointing away from the β-sheet in the absence of bound rna  <cit> . all of the lysines are replaced with non-charged residues in c. elegans, while a. gambiae and d. melanogaster have identical k <dig>  a conservative k <dig> → r <dig> substitution, but a non-charged substitution at residue  <dig> 

extended multiple alignment
a multiple alignment of the complete sequences for the group of organisms analyzed is available as a supplement. the complete cstf- <dig> protein sequence consists of five distinct regions. the n-terminal  cstf- <dig> rrm and helix c are highly conserved. in addition, the "hinge" region of cstf- <dig>  which interacts with both cstf- <dig> and symplekin  <cit>  is also highly conserved. the hinge region is followed by a low-complexity proline-glycine rich region . the  <dig> contiguous mear repeats  including the interspersed rgg motifs, are weakly conserved outside of amniotes, if present at all. the remaining c-terminal residues  are highly conserved, reportedly reflecting the interaction between cstf- <dig> and the transcriptional coactivator pc <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
ug- and u-rich signals are distinct dses
unlike the previous computational studies of the metazoan dse cited above, our analysis explicitly includes characterization of the positioning biases relative to the 3'-processing site. while it is possible that the u/ug-rich dses comprise one motif, several aspects of our analysis lead us to the conclusion that our results are consistent with the presence of distinct ug- and u-rich elements as proposed by mcdevitt et al.  <cit>  and gil and proudfoot  <cit> .  while the positioning distributions of the u- and ug-rich sequences have considerable overlap, it is clear from figures  <dig> and  <dig> that they are distinct. previous experimental studies have occasionally produced longer putative elements that included both ug- and u-rich portions , however, if the functional element was a single longer element, we would expect ug- and u-rich positioning distributions with a common shape, but offset in position. in contrast, we observe distinct distributions that are more consistent with two independent elements separated by variable spacing.  finally, the typical separation that we observe between the vertebrate ug- and u-rich elements  would imply a significantly longer rrm binding site than has been previously observed  <cit> .

our analysis indicates that the u-rich element is more prevalent than the ug-rich element in all species studied, and the sequence content and relative positioning of the u-rich element in all vertebrate species is consistent with previous in vitro polyadenylation assays  <cit>  and cstf-64-pre-rna uv cross linking studies  <cit> , as well as the recent nmr studies of cstf- <dig>  <cit> . somewhat paradoxically, the sequence content of the ug-rich element in the vertebrates is consistent with the results of the cstf- <dig> selex binding experiments  <cit> . implications of these differences are discussed below. we believe that the historical difficulties in clear delineation of these elements are likely due to a convergence of several mitigating factors, including the degenerate sequence content of both the ug- and u-rich elements, significant overlap in both the positioning  and sequence content  of the two elements, and a typical emphasis on only sequence content in computational investigations.

an interaction model for the cstf- <dig> rrm with precursor mrna
our comparative studies of the variation in the primary protein sequence of the cstf- <dig> rrm have highlighted differences in potentially critical residues that correlate with changes in the apparent binding sites identified by our statistical analysis. these correlations put us in a position to speculate on the mechanism of interaction between the rrm of cstf- <dig> and the downstream region of the precursor mrnas. we hypothesize that the data presented here, in conjunction with previous published work, supports a model in which the proximal ug-rich element is involved in the necessary displacement of helix c  <cit>  that exposes the β-sheet for binding to the distal u-rich element.

evidence for an interaction between the β-sheet and the u-rich element
uv-crosslinking of cstf- <dig>  <cit>  revealed sequence content and positioning very similar to the u-rich element we describe in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the nmr structures of the vertebrate cstf- <dig> rrm indicate that the binding pocket targets the uu di-nucleotide and that the larger ug di-nucleotide is discriminated against based on size  <cit> . using specific oligomers, it was also shown that the  <dig> sequence has a two-fold weaker interaction with the cstf than does the 4ug sequence  <cit> . u-rich dses are a ubiquitous pattern of all organisms studied here, including c. elegans. the beta strands that form the rna-binding sheet are also nearly perfectly conserved. the observed changes  are either conservative in side-chain substitution or oriented such that the side-chains face away from the binding pocket surface. in contrast, helix c displays considerable variation, as described below.

evidence for an interaction between helix c and the ug-rich element
the nmr studies showed that in the absence of rna, helix c is stably bound to residues in the rrm binding pocket, thereby occluding it  <cit> . the residues responsible for this interaction are absolutely conserved in the vertebrate sequences we have examined. significant changes found in the invertebrates likely disrupt or weaken the β-sheet to helix c interaction. these differences correlate with changes in the statistical patterns we identified for dses. specifically, in c. elegans, ten of the sixteen helix c residues are changed from the vertebrate consensus, and many of these differences are non-conservative . this correlates with complete absence of the proximal ug-rich element. in d. melanogaster and a. gambiae, the change in apparent affinity  is more subtle, e.g., the ucug-like variant of the vertebrate ug-rich element is absent. several significant changes in helix c residues can be correlated with this change, including an n <dig> → s <dig> substitution that could disrupt the hydrogen bonding to n <dig> predicted in the vertebrate structure. in addition, both d. melanogaster and a. gambiae are missing k <dig>  which is conserved in vertebrates. according to the nmr structure  <cit> , the k <dig> side chain is directed away from the beta sheet, an orientation that would make possible interactions between the charged amino side-chain and the rna backbone. the observed correlations in protein sequence and apparent rna affinity imply that helix c plays an important role in defining the dse region. the importance of helix c is consistent with a forthcoming study of the in vitro binding affinities of variant forms of recombinant cstf- <dig> .

what is the state of helix c during transcription?
the conformation of helix c during transcription is currently unknown, however it must be unwound or displaced prior to rna binding  <cit> . if helix c was already displaced during transcription, the rna binding process would be a single event. although a single step binding process cannot be ruled out at this time, we find it to be unlikely as it would fail to explain the presence of both proximal ug-rich and distal u-rich elements. we speculate that helix c is structurally intact while scanning the nascent rna and that a preliminary interaction is required for displacement. as described above, differences in helix c primary sequence correlate with changes in the pattern, or even existence, of the proximal ug-rich element. in addition, assuming a 5'-to-3' processivity, the proximal positioning of the ug-rich element is consistent with a role in the displacement of helix c that exposes the beta sheet for binding to the more prevalent distal u-rich element. if the model we propose is accurate, and cstf- <dig> is responsible for interactions with both dses, it provides an explanation for the discrepancy between sequence preferences observed in selex  <cit>  and cross-linking studies. it remains an open question why selex measurements would favor the initial interaction with the ug-rich element.

c. elegans, polycistronic transcripts and the proximal ug-rich element
the distinct changes in both the cstf- <dig> rrm sequence and apparent binding affinity in c. elegans are not surprising, given the known differences in 3'-processing. approximately 15% of the genes in c. elegans are expressed in polycistronic transcripts  <cit> , which are processed into monocistronic transcripts in a reaction that includes both 3'-processing and trans-splicing of a leader rna to the downstream portion of the precursor  <cit> . despite the peculiar nature of these transcripts, they are not sufficient by themselves to explain the absence of the proximal ug-rich element. the loss of the proximal ug-rich element is a transcriptome wide change and therefore likely reflects the rna binding properties of the c. elegans cstf- <dig> 

the mear repeats are not critical for ug- or u-rich dse interactions
previous reports speculated on a role for the mear repeats in the cstf- <dig> pre-mrna interaction  <cit> . our analyses counter-indicate direct involvement of the mear repeats in recognition of either the ug- or u-rich dses, since the mear repeats are greatly reduced or absent in fish species , but the ug- and u-rich patterns are essentially unchanged from other vertebrates . in addition, selex studies that included only the n-terminal region of cstf- <dig>  resulted in both ug- and u-rich binding patterns  <cit> . although the function of the mear like repeats is currently unknown, the striking reduction in fish and the invertebrates correlates with the loss of the g-rich signal in the far  downstream region . g-rich elements have been implicated as auxiliary 3'-processing elements, interacting with heteronuclear rnp complexes  <cit> , acting as transcriptional pause sites  <cit> , or forming a secondary structure based on the presence of g-quadruplexes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in our analysis of  <dig>  high-quality 3'-processing sites spanning  <dig> genomes, we present the u/ug-rich dse as two parts: a proximal ug-rich element with approximate positioning  <dig> to  <dig> nt downstream of the processing site and a distal u-rich element  <dig> to  <dig> nt from the processing site. our results indicate that historical difficulties in classifying these elements are likely a consequence of their similarity in both sequence content and positioning. the distinct nature and positioning of the dses leads us to consider a model where the cstf- <dig> rrm interacts with both the ug- and u-rich elements separately and sequentially. specifically, we hypothesize that the proximal ug-rich element contributes to the displacement of helix c, which exposes the rrm beta-sheet for subsequent binding to the distal u-rich element. while this model is speculative, it is consistent with both our results and previous studies.

confirmation of this model through site directed mutagenesis or other techniques may lead to a better understanding of how the dse region directs cleavage site choice and ultimately its role in alternate polyadenylation.
