BACKGROUND
the processes of life depend on intermolecular recognition. molecular recognition by proteins is a complex process that is determined not only by direct interactions of a protein with the interacting molecule, but also by indirect effects arising at distant sites in the proteins. using three-dimensional  structure approaches it is not straightforward to analyze long distance effects on, for example, protein conformation, mobility, and stability. recently, a new approach using statistical analysis of protein and ligand interaction space, proteochemometrics, was developed  <cit> . it was used to model protein-peptide interactions and interactions of proteins with organic compounds  <cit> . here we show its utility in predicting indirect effects in proteins.

proteochemometrics originates from chemometrics, the mathematical methods used to analyze chemical data. proteochemometrics aims to describe the interactions between a series of macromolecules  and a series of ligands. proteochemometric models are thereby created. these models are useful for predicting the affinities of new proteins for their ligands if the new molecules fall within the description space of the protein-ligand pairs of the training data set. a proteochemometric experiment is typically described by three descriptor blocks; the ligand descriptor , protein descriptor , and ligand-protein cross-term  blocks. a vector of numbers, called the ligand descriptors , characterizes each ligand l. similarly, each protein p has its protein descriptors . if we use a linear method of regression, the negative logarithm of ligand l's affinity  for the protein p is expressed by:

accordingly, we can localize regions in a protein that afford selectivity  for a particular ligand by applying eq.  <dig>  a region can be a subsequence, a 3d molecular interaction field, a single amino acid, or even a physicochemical property of an individual amino acid, and is only restricted by the way the descriptors are assigned to the proteins  <cit> . since eq.  <dig> places no restriction how far in space a ligand is located from a region in a protein, proteochemometrics is useful to predict indirect interactions in proteins.

RESULTS
design and testing of multiple chimeric melanocortin receptor library
it is necessary to have modifications of both the proteins and ligands, preferably both in the form of a series , in order to use eq.  <dig>  here we used a library of multiple chimeric melanocortin receptors  <cit> . briefly, the library was created from four natural melanocortin receptors . each receptor was divided into five sequence fragments  and multiple chimeric receptors were then obtained by systematically shuffling the fragments. in order to maximize the chemical space information of the receptors, while keeping the number of experiments as low as possible, statistical molecular design was applied to properly select the sequence fragments  <cit> . the entire receptor library comprised  <dig> receptors and was tested for its interaction with the native melanocortin ligand, α-msh and the synthetic msh analogues ndp-msh and -ndp-msh .

proteochemometrics modelling
interpretation of eq. <dig> is dependent on our description of the proteins. here two proteochemometrics models were created. one was based on a binary description of the proteins. the other used physicochemical descriptions of amino acids located inside transmembrane regions with presumed proximity to possible ligand binding cleft according to the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin  <cit> . the binary model comprised information on the extent to which segments s1–s <dig> are involved in the selective recognition of ligands by the receptors, while the model based on physicochemical descriptions of amino acids comprised information on the contributions of single amino acids. both models performed excellently in state-of-the-art model validations .

prediction of ligand recognition
the models were used to compute selectivity recognition maps for all melanocortin receptor pairs for the α-msh hormone . α-msh is recognized by mc receptors, albeit it binds with more than  <dig> times higher affinity to the mc <dig> receptor than to the mc <dig> receptor. the recognition map derived from the binary model predicted that segments s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig> play major roles for the α-msh mc1/mc <dig> selectivity, while s <dig> and s <dig> contribute only a little . the involvement of s <dig> and s <dig> was expected, as these regions possess amino acids close to the ligand recognition site according to 3d modelling  <cit> . however, the whole s <dig> region was located farther away, and its involvement was therefore more surprising. the model based on amino-acid physicochemical properties in the transmembrane regions indicated that three amino acids in s <dig>  five in s <dig>  one in s <dig>  and one in s <dig> caused the mc1/mc <dig> receptor selectivity .

verification of predictions using mutagenesis
in order to assess the predictions for the ten amino acid positions predicted with by the model based on physicochemical properties of amino-acids located inside the receptors transmembrane regions, they were subjected to single, double, triple, pentuple, and heptuple mutations in the mc <dig> receptor, replacing them with the corresponding amino acids in the mc <dig> receptor. measurements taken from the mutants showed that seven positions gave the expected increase in affinity for α-msh . combining amino acid substitutions also gave higher increases in affinity than did the single point mutations .

however, three of the ten positions  did not show the predicted increase in affinity . the failure of the a89s and i102a mutations to increase the affinity of the mc <dig> receptor can be explained by the presence of several amino acid positions in the protein library that show the same or similar variability . for example, positions a <dig> and a <dig>  both reside in the same segment and are serines in the mc <dig> receptor and alanines in the mc <dig>  mc <dig>  and mc <dig> receptors. such co-varying sequence positions gain equal importance in a proteochemometric model, even when some of them are not responsible for the explained activity. in the present library, mutations a89s, i102a, i129t, a135s, and l141g represent co-varying amino acid positions. the failure of the a89s and i102a mutations to cause the predicted increase in affinity may thus be explained on the basis of co-variance, where the actual effect is caused by mutations i129t, a135s, and l141g. in fact, the sum of the experimentally determined affinity increase by mutations a89s, i102a, i129t, a135s, and l141g  closely agrees with that predicted from the model .

however, the failure of mutation i251l to increase affinity could not be explained by co-variances of amino acids within the model. accordingly the predicted effect must originate from amino acids actually co-varying in the library but excluded from the modelling in the selections of amino acids based on 3d structure. three such possible excluded positions partially co-varying with i <dig> are found in the midst of tm <dig>  three are found towards the intracellular face of the lipid bi-layer in tm <dig>  and several are present in the third intracellular loop. in the 3d structure, these amino acids are obviously located very far from any eventual binding pocket for α-msh. to verify the prediction that these positions are responsible for the 'missing' affinity they were mutated separately and in combinations . although all mutations afforded an increase in affinity, most of the increase  was afforded by swapping the entire third intracellular loop . .

discussion
the experimental data demonstrate the utility of proteochemometrics for mapping ligand recognition. using it seven amino-acid positions and the third intracellular loop were identified as accounting for most of the difference in affinity of the mc <dig> and mc <dig> receptor for α-msh. the ability to localize a distant effect in a protein distinguishes proteochemometrics from other approaches to mapping molecular recognition. a general scheme for mapping ligand recognition using proteochemometrics is outlined in fig.  <dig>  the protein library might initially be collected from wild-type proteins, or created by constructing multiple chimeric proteins, as performed in this study. applying experimental design could, in both cases, substantially reduce the number of entities that need to be constructed and tested without detrimentally compromising the information gained  <cit> . the application of proteochemometric modelling to the data creates a selectivity recognition map for the proteins and ligands. analyzing the map  reveals the regions in the proteins involved in recognition of the ligands in a data-set. regions of high interest can then be identified and analyzed further by extending the library, if necessary, in order to remove ambiguities due to co-variances . in the selection of the regions for mutations the present study shows that also distant effects on protein function should be taken into account. overall the approach would lead to a substantial gain in information at reduced experimental effort

mapping molecular recognition with proteochemometrics obtains different information than 3d-structure-based methods. the latter generally reveal where one particular ligand touches one particular receptor in one of many bound states. proteochemometrics, by contrast, reveals regions of biomacromolecules that influence the selectivity of their ligand binding, and it has the capacity to predict effects arising from distant sites in a protein. the information obtained is only partially overlapping and, therefore, the approaches complement each other. the information gained in proteochemometrics relates to protein function and has direct utility for changing the function of a protein in a desired direction by mutation, in a priori protein engineering, or by altering the structure of a chemical entity and improving its interaction with binding sites, in a priori drug design  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work we have presented a theoretical basis for the use of proteochemometrics to assess direct and indirect interactions in proteins, and we verified its utility to this end experimentally. we have also outlined a general strategy to afford cost effective mapping of molecular recognition using proteochemometrics and indicate important differences of proteochemometric mapping of ligand recognitions compared to traditional three-dimensional approaches. we propose that proteochemometrics can be used as a complement to classical 3d based methods to the study of ligand recognition, or even as the prime choice, in particular when three-dimensional protein structures are not available. moreover, since proteochemometrics can be used to map both direct and indirect interactions, it may find a more general use in e.g. protein engineering and mapping protein function.
