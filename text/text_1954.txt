BACKGROUND
eya <dig> is one of four mammalian orthologous genes  of eyes absent  in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . previous investigations demonstrated that a homozygous knockout of eya function in d. melanogaster results in severe embryonic defects and absence of compound eyes due to eye progenitor cell death  <cit> . like eyes absent in drosophila, mammalian eya genes encode for transcriptional co-activator proteins and are widely co-expressed with pax <dig>  six <dig>  six <dig> and dachshund  genes. it is assumed that eya genes are part of a hierarchically organized and highly conserved regulatory network during eye development with pax <dig> on its top and six and dach genes as major players  <cit> .

eya proteins interact as transcriptional cofactors with six and dachshund proteins and do not possess dna-binding properties. eya proteins are characterized by a conserved 271-aa c-terminal domain  which is believed to have a dual function  <cit> : on one hand, it mediates protein-protein interactions with six and dachshund proteins  <cit> ; it is further required for nuclear translocation of eya proteins  <cit> . on the other hand, in-vitro experiments demonstrated a tyrosine-phosphatase activity of the ed suggesting a catalytic function of this domain  <cit> . a second and far less conserved domain is the eya domain  <dig> , which is located in the n-terminal region of the protein and presumably serves as a transactivation domain  <cit> .

the relevance of mutations in the ed for the emergence of diseases has been widely shown for eya <dig>  in humans, eya <dig> haploinsufficiency is responsible for branchio-oto-renal  syndrome or branchio-oto  syndrome. bor is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by branchial cysts, ear malformations, hearing loss and renal abnormalities. interestingly, the majority of bor disease-associated missense mutations clusters in the ed and therefore suggest an important role for the ed in the development of these diseases  <cit> . mice in which  <dig> of  <dig> amino acids of the eya1-ed have been deleted die at birth and show severe craniofacial and skeletal defects and an absence of ears, kidneys, thymus and parathyroid glands  <cit> . eya1+/- mice show a phenotype, which is comparable to humans suffering from bor syndrome. they display renal abnormalities and conductive hearing loss. neither eya1+/- nor eya1-/- mice reveal ocular defects and only in a few cases could eya <dig> mutations be associated with congenital cataracts and ocular anterior segment anomalies in humans  <cit> .

moreover, eya genes are associated with the proper development of muscles. drosophila eya mutants show musculature defects  <cit> ; mouse embryos deficient for eya <dig> and six <dig> have a complete absence of all hypaxial muscle and a severe reduction of epaxial muscle  <cit> . while neither in eya1-/- nor in eya2-/- mice can a muscle phenotype be observed, eya1-/-eya2-/- double knockout embryos display muscle-less limbs  <cit> . for eya <dig> it was shown in tissue culture experiments that it interacts with six <dig> and dach <dig> to regulate pax <dig> and therefore to influence myogenic differentiation  <cit> . in addition, eya genes seem to play a role in heart and auditory function in vertebrates. mutations of the eya <dig> gene resulting in truncated eya <dig> proteins cause dilated cardiomyopathy and conductive hearing loss in humans  <cit>  and eya <dig> mutations in mice are responsible for an abnormal morphology of the middle ear  <cit> . injection of morpholino oligonucleotides against eya <dig> into zebrafish  embryos indicated an abnormal morphological and physiological phenotype of the heart  <cit> . obviously, eya genes are involved in the proper development of many tissues in vertebrates including the ear, muscles, heart, renal system and possibly the eye.

however, the influence of eya <dig> on developmental processes in mice and other mammals is rather unknown. in-vitro experiments showed that eya <dig> is important for cell-autonomous proliferation of murine myoblast c2c <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, studies in xenopus revealed a strong influence of the eya <dig> homologous gene xeya <dig> on survival and proliferation of neural progenitor cells in the anterior neural plate of xenopus embryos  <cit> . there are, however, no indications for a similar expression pattern, neither in fishes nor in mice, and we cannot observe a brain phenotype in our mouse eya <dig> mutants. to our knowledge, this eya3-deficient mutant is the first mouse model for a mutation affecting eya <dig> and therefore an excellent model to study its function in mammals. our systemic analysis within the german mouse clinic  demonstrated a broad spectrum of minor physiological changes in the eya3-deficient mice. among them, the reduced movement of the mutant mice and effects on their respiratory, muscle and heart function are the most striking changes.

RESULTS
 <dig>  molecular characterization of eya3-deficient mice
gene trap vector insertion was detected in a  <dig>  kb large intronic region of the eya <dig> gene  using 5'race and pcr experiments and combining different forward primers and a reverse primer in the lacz cassette of the pt1βgeo-vector. by cloning and sequencing of a  <dig>  kb fragment in this region the integration site was determined to  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  . genotyping of mice confirmed the vector integration at the determined locus .

rt-pcr and northern-blotting demonstrated the complete loss of exons 8– <dig> of the eya <dig> gene in homozygous mutant animals. transcripts containing exons 1– <dig> were detected in wild-type and heterozygous embryos at the age of e <dig>  , e <dig>   and e <dig>  . in contrast, no transcripts covering the exons 1– <dig>  8– <dig> or 12– <dig> were detectable in homozygous eya3-mutants . additionally, using a probe covering exons 8– <dig>  northern-blotting  were consistent with the results received from rt-pcr .

 <dig> offspring from heterozygous matings have been checked: there were  <dig> males  and  <dig> females ;  <dig> animals were wild type ,  <dig> heterozygous  and  <dig> animals homozygous mutants ; the mean litter size was  <dig>  offspring. these date indicate no major deviation from the expected numbers according to the mendelian laws suggesting normal fertility of the heterozygotes and survival of the homozygous mutants.

 <dig>  expression pattern of eya <dig> in the mouse and consequences of eya <dig> invalidation
eya <dig> shows a complex expression pattern during embryonic development. the expression pattern of eya <dig> is identical, if analyzed by in-situ hybridization in wild-type embryos or by β-gal expression in eya3-/- mutant mice; data gathered from β-gal staining of mutant embryos  demonstrated an expression of eya <dig> at e <dig>  in the developing neural tissues predominantly in the neural epithelium of the telencephalic vesicle and the later forebrain. further on, lacz staining is found in the somites, in the mandibular and maxillary component of the first branchial arch, in the optic vesicle and in the otic vesicle. in addition, an expression in the forelimb bud is visible. the expression of lacz continues at the developmental stage e <dig>  in the epithelium of the telencephalic vesicle and in tectorial regions of the developing brain. moreover, eya <dig> expression is indicated in the region surrounding the olfactory pit, the somites, fore- and hindlimb bud and in the trigeminal nerve. the first and second branchial arches display eya3/lacz transcripts, but the expression in the first branchial arch is mainly restricted to the mandibular component. at e <dig>  eya <dig> expression is detectable in the olfactory pit, the developing eye, the otic vesicle, tectorial and pretectorial regions of the brain, fore- and hindlimbs and in somites. at e <dig> , eya <dig> transcripts are most prominent in the limbs, in the tail and in cortical regions of the brain. later , the expression of eya <dig> continues in the cerebellar cortex and in the limbs as well as in the ventral and dorsal grey horn of the spinal cord .

eya <dig> expression in the eye  is first visible at e <dig>  in the detaching lens vesicle. later on transcripts are restricted to the retina and the lens epithelium . in adult mice , an expression of eya <dig> was traceable by rt-pcr in the brain, skeletal muscles, heart and kidneys. the lung displayed only a very weak eya <dig> expression, while in the liver no expression was detected.

 <dig>  eya <dig> expression in zebrafish development
because of the obvious strong difference in the eya <dig> expression pattern between mouse and xenopus, we investigated eya <dig> expression also in zebrafish embryos. like at early developmental stages in mice, whole mount in-situ hybridization revealed a ubiquitous expression of eya <dig> in early zebrafish embryos throughout gastrulation and early somitogenesis. at the 10-somite-stage , expression becomes more restricted to the anterior part of the embryo and at the 20-somite-stage  it is most prominent in the brain and developing eye. by the beginning of the second day of development , eya <dig> expression strongly decreases and becomes only weakly detectable in the eye, optic tectum and olfactory placode .

 <dig>  general characterization of the eya3-/- phenotype
in cooperation with the german mouse clinic  <cit>   <dig> wild-type controls  and  <dig> eya3-/- mice  have been analyzed in a comprehensive phenotypic screen.

eya <dig> mutant animals have been investigated for bone- and weight-related quantitative parameters at the age of  <dig> weeks. among these parameters, the homozygous eya <dig> mutants showed significant differences in bone mineral content, body weight and body length as compared to the control littermates. at the age of  <dig> weeks, these three parameters were significantly  reduced in male mutants. female mutants also displayed lower values compared to wild-type animals without reaching the level of statistical significance .

*p <  <dig>  ; data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean

data from expression analysis demonstrated that eya <dig> is expressed in the developing ear and in the adult kidney. however, no significant differences between eya <dig> knockout and wild-type animals have been observed in either functional or histological analyses, suggesting that eya <dig> is not a major player in these organs. moreover, expression analysis displayed that eya <dig> is expressed in the retina and in the lens epithelium of the eye , suggesting that eya <dig> may be important for proper lens and retina development. however, histological analysis of eyes taken from adult mice revealed no morphological differences between wild-type controls and homozygous eya <dig> mutant mice . further on, the investigation of the posterior part of the eye by funduscopy  did not show striking phenotypical differences of the retinal structure between wild-type and mutant animals. in addition to the morphological examination of the retina a rough functional analysis was done by electroretinography  . measurement of retinal and ganglion cell response to the light stimulus displayed no significant  deviations in mutant animals compared to wild-type controls.

an investigation of the eye size by laser interference biometry was performed to identify eye size variation between wild-type controls and eya <dig> mutant animals . anterior chamber depth, lens size and axial length were measured revealing no significant  deviations between wild-type mice and homozygous eya <dig> mutant mice.

alteration in lung, heart and muscle function
the expression analysis  demonstrated that eya <dig> is expressed in heart and muscle, but only weakly in the lung. nevertheless, systematic analysis of the function of these three organ systems showed significant alterations.

to evaluate the lung function, several parameters have been tested in male eya3-/- mutants and compared to wild-type littermates . among these parameters, the tidal volume at rest is significantly reduced  in the mutants . this difference is more striking , if related to the body weight . in this context, it might be of interest that the respiratory rate of the mutant mice is enhanced, even if it does not reach the level of statistical significance . however, this may suggest that compensatory mechanisms are triggered. the reduced muscle strength – if transferable to respiratory muscles – may limit the potential volume to be inspired and, thus, result in the observed reduced tidal volume. consequently, the respiratory rate is increased leading to strikingly similar minute ventilations in wild type and eya3-/- .

in addition, cardiovascular function was examined by tail-cuff blood pressure and by electrocardiography . analysis of blood pressure revealed no genotype-specific differences between wild-type and mutant mice. in contrast, the ecg showed significant genotype-specific differences between controls and mutants of both sexes . the time from onset of the electrical impulse in the sinu-atrial node until ventricular depolarization  was increased. additionally, the time from ventricular depolarization to repolarization  was extended, and the amplitude of the qrs-complex representing ventricular depolarization was highly significantly decreased in mutant animals .

for evaluation of the behavioral phenotype, the spontaneous activity of mice was measured using a modified hole-board test. the mutants demonstrated a mild increase in exploratory behavior as indicated by a reduced latency to hole exploration. the frequency of rearings in the box was also enhanced in the mutants. however, the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance. in contrast, mutant mice exhibited a reduced forward locomotor activity, measured as reduced distance travel, reduced maximum velocity and reduced frequency of turns; the mean velocity was also reduced, but the difference did not reach the level of significance . the reduced locomotor activity might be associated with reduced muscle strength in these mice as indicated by the results of the forelimb grip strength test: eya <dig> mutant mice of both sexes revealed a significant  reduction of muscle strength. however, the performance on the rotarod was only slightly impaired and did not reach the level of statistical significance.

analysis of differentially expressed genes in eya <dig> mutant mice
since the members of the eya gene family are discussed to be members of a conserved regulatory network during eye development including also six and dach genes and pax <dig> on its top  <cit> , we tested the influence of the loss of eya <dig> activity on their expression. fig. 8a demonstrates that all six six genes as well as the two dach genes are not changed in their overall expression at least within the critical phase of early eye development between e <dig>  and e <dig> . on the other side, we checked also the eya <dig> expression in two pax <dig> mutant alleles ; the overall eya <dig> expression is obviously not altered even in homozygous pax <dig> mutant embryos. the same is true in a pitx <dig> mutant aphakia . these results indicate that eya <dig> is no major player in the regulatory network of eye development.

to obtain a systematic overview on the expression of downstream target genes, we performed an expression profiling analysis using a genome-wide cdna microarray approach. gene expression patterns of skeletal muscle, heart, and brain of adult, homozygous eya <dig> mutants were compared to wild-type littermates. in skeletal muscles of eya <dig> mutant mice no significantly regulated genes were detected between mutant and wild-type tissue. in contrast,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in brain . in heart tissue all  <dig> differentially regulated genes showed decreased expression levels in the eya <dig> mutant mice . due to the limited number of regulated genes, no over-representation of gene ontology  terms could be identified in these  <dig> genes. however, among the differentially regulated genes in the brain, the macromolecule biosynthetic process was over-represented for biological processes, and the structural constituent of cytoskeleton and structural constituent of ribosome were over-represented for molecular functions.

among these differentially regulated genes, nup <dig>  was significantly down-regulated both, in heart  and brain . validation of nup <dig> expression level with real-time pcr confirmed the differential regulation in both organs of the eya3-/- mutant mice . since the nup <dig> protein is discussed to be involved in the transport of proteins and mrna, its reduced expression in brain and heart might also contribute to the alterations observed in the behavioral phenotype of the eya <dig> mutant mice and of their slightly altered cardiac function.

discussion
the gene eyes absent was shown to have a prominent function during eye development of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . in contrast, the mammalian orthologs seem to play a far less important role in eye development.

in contrast to xenopus embryos, where the expression of xeya <dig> is restricted exclusively to the anterior neural plate and cells of the prospective brain and eye within neurulation , our results from mice and zebrafish display a ubiquitous expression of eya <dig> in early embryos during neural plate stage. it is only by the end of neurulation that a restriction of eya <dig> expression to distinct regions like forebrain and eye in mice or optic tectum and eye in zebrafish is observable. thus, our expression analysis for eya <dig> in mouse and zebrafish demonstrates striking differences between these organisms and xenopus, suggesting the possibility of different functions for eya <dig> among vertebrate species.

this might be due to differences in regulatory mechanisms of eya <dig> between these organisms. comparative sequence analysis of the eya <dig> upstream region using mvista  revealed a significantly higher number of conserved non-coding sequences  between mouse and zebrafish than between mouse and xenopus , indicating the possibility that eya <dig> genes gained individual expression patterns and functions among vertebrate species due to evolutionary determined diversity in regulatory mechanisms.

the results of our phenotypic study on eya <dig> are in line with earlier findings in other mammalian eya genes indicating that their loss does not have an effect on eye development and ocular functions. eye disorders have not been observed in eya <dig>  eya <dig> or eya <dig> mutant mice  <cit> . additionally, histological analysis and detailed investigation of ocular morphology and function by tests such as electroretinography and the optokinetic reflex in the eya <dig> knockout mutants presented here did not show any differences between the eyes of wild-type controls and hetero- or homozygous eya <dig> mutant animals, although expression of eya <dig> was detected in the retina and in the lens epithelium during eye development. in addition to the striking differences between the function of eya genes in drosophila and mice, there are also important differences between the phenotypes of eya mutants among vertebrates. in contrast to morpholino-injected xenopus embryos  <cit> , eya <dig> mutant mice showed a normal development of neural tissues.

nevertheless, further investigations revealed clear differences in bone mineral content and body length between wild-type animals and eya <dig> mutant mice, suggesting an impact of eya <dig> on physical constitution in general, leading to a reduction of growth. moreover, eya <dig> is expressed in the developing muscle, and concomitantly, the forelimb grip strength is reduced in the mutant mice. this might be a reason for the observed decreased locomotor activity of the eya <dig> mutant mice. muscle deficiencies have been reported also for eya1-/-eya2-/- mutant mice  <cit> , and also for six <dig>  encoding a potential interaction partner of eya proteins, which is also required for proper muscle development  <cit> .

moreover, the results from additional physiological investigations indicate that eya <dig> mutant mice suffer also from some heart and lung problems as indicated by some ecg parameters  and a decreased tidal volume of the lung. indeed, eya <dig> is also involved in cardiac processes as demonstrated previously in human and zebrafish  <cit> . taking the lung, heart and muscle alterations together, the significantly reduced locomotion might be understood as a consequence of all these features. since we have tested the mice only at a young age, these deficits might accumulate during ageing and therefore be responsible for more severe deficits when the mice become older.

to understand the molecular network involving eya <dig>  we analyzed differentially expressed genes in the mutants. we identified several regulated genes in heart and brain indicating regulatory effects of the eya <dig> mutation or secondary affects based upon missing or changed cell types. among them, nup <dig> was confirmed by real-time pcr to be significantly down-regulated in both organs. nup <dig> is involved in nuclear envelope formation during cell division and is important for the export of macromolecules like mrnas from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. depletion of nup <dig> leads to a failure of nuclear lamina formation and defects in chromosome segregation at anaphase  <cit>  and therefore has an important impact on cell proliferation. nup <dig> encodes a protein containing nucleoporin, a non-repetitive/wga-negative domain. gene ontology  terms indicate that nup <dig> protein is located in a nuclear pore and in a membrane.

among the  <dig> down-regulated genes in the heart of eya <dig> mutant mice, some are associated with specific cardiac functions, e.g. tnnc <dig> is involved in cardiac muscle contraction, calm <dig> plays a role in calcium signaling, and ankrd <dig> is a transcriptional co-factor being required during cardiac myogenesis  <cit> .

furthermore, for several regulated genes in the brain an association with neurodegeneration, particularly with alzheimer disease has been found. among the up-regulated genes, ass <dig> expression levels were significantly higher in glial cells of alzheimer's disease brains  <cit> . among the genes being down-regulated in the brains of eya <dig> mutants, several are reported to be down-regulated also in alzheimer's disease, e.g. arpp <dig>  <cit> , birc <dig>  <cit> , mt <dig>  <cit> , syt <dig>  <cit>  or ttr  <cit> . moreover, the sca <dig> gene, which is down-regulated in the brain of the eya <dig> mutants, is also down-regulated in patients suffering from parkinson's disease  <cit> . this short comparison between the differentially expressed genes in the eya <dig> mutant mice with corresponding features in neurodegenerative disorders in human patients points to an interesting putative role of eya <dig> in alzheimer's and parkinson's disease. this function might be attributed by putative interaction of eya <dig> with either six <dig>  or with pax <dig>  . these functional considerations are based upon associative interpretations of available literature and comparison with the data obtained during the basic characterization of the eya <dig> mutant opening several interesting avenues for further detailed experimental studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that eya <dig> affects particularly heart, lung and muscle functions. even if the exploratory behavior is increased, the mutant mice move less than the wild-type mice. together with the effects on respiratory, muscle and heart function, it might lead to more severe effects, when the mice become older. therefore, future investigations of eya <dig> function should focus on effects on aging mice and consider also effects related to neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer's or parkinson's disease.
