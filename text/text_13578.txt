BACKGROUND
knowledge of mitochondrial genomes is important for many scientific disciplines  <cit>  and the relative arrangement of mitochondrial genes has been effective for studying phylogenetic relationships  <cit> . however, current knowledge of mtdnas is uneven, and sequences available in genbank are predominantly from vertebrate taxa. there are about  <dig> described species  <cit>  of nemerteans ; these are mainly marine but terrestrial and freshwater species also are known. to date, complete mitochondrial genomes have been published for only three species in the phylum, cephalothrix hongkongiensis  , lineus viridis   <cit> , and paranemertes cf. peregrina  <cit> . nearly complete sequences exist for the palaeonemerteans cephalothrix sp.  <cit>  and cephalothrix rufifrons  <cit> . thus, current genomic knowledge of nemerteans is scant and taxon diversity is poorly sampled. in this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genomes of two nemertean species, nectonemertes cf. mirabilis  and zygeupolia rubens . mitochondrial gene arrangements, structures, and compositions, as well as translation and initiation codons and codon usage patterns, were compared with complete mtdna sequences of other nemerteans. in addition, we compare gene order among lophotrochozoa and we use the nucleotide sequences to analyze phylogenetic relationship among the included nemerteans.

RESULTS
genome organization and structure
genome composition and gene arrangement of nectonemertes cf. mirabilis and zygeupolia rubens are summarized in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the mitochondrial genomes of n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens are circular dna molecules of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively. lengths of the two nemertean mitochondrial genomes are within the range of previously sequenced nemertean mtdnas -  <dig> bp in paranemertes cf. peregrina to  <dig> bp in cephalothrix hongkongiensis  <cit> . both of the newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> genes, including  <dig> protein-coding genes, two ribosomal rnas, and  <dig> transfer rnas. all genes except trnp and trnt are encoded on the same strand .

for both species, protein-coding genes nad4l and nad <dig> share an overlap, by seven nucleotides, and nad <dig> overlaps cob by eight nucleotides in z. rubens . such overlaps are common to all known mtdna genomes of nemerteans  <cit> , and are found in many metazoan mtdnas  <cit> .

protein-coding genes
thirteen protein-coding genes  were identified. mitochondrial genomes often use a variety of nonstandard initiation codons  <cit> . except for nad <dig> , nad <dig> , atp <dig>  and atp <dig>  in n. cf. mirabilis, and nad <dig>  and nad <dig>  in z. rubens, the protein-coding genes of both species begin with atg. the majority of genes in both species contain the full termination codon taa or tag, but some end with t . such abbreviated stop codons are common among animal mitochondrial genes. in z. rubens, the incomplete stop codons are immediately followed by the downstream trna gene , whose secondary structure has been suggested to act as a signal for the cleavage of the polycistronic primary transcript  <cit> . however, there also are direct junctions pairing ten protein-coding genes in n. cf. mirabilis  and eight in z. rubens  . here, cleavage signals other than secondary structure of a trna gene may initiate processing of the polycistronic primary transcript  <cit> . for two protein-coding genes  in both nemertean species and nad <dig> in n. cf. mirabilis, stem-loop structures were inferred to be at the 3' end and abutting the 5' end of the neighboring protein-coding gene, and may signal cleavage of the immature mrna  <cit> .

transfer rna and ribosomal rna genes
both of the mitochondrial genomes encoded  <dig> trna genes found in other nemertean mtdnas, which is typical of animal mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . they varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nucleotides in n. cf. mirabilis and  <dig>  to  <dig>  nucleotides in z. rubens ; most were folded into a typical cloverleaf secondary structure . the postulated trna cloverleaf structures generally contained  <dig> bp in the aminoacyl stem,  <dig> to  <dig> bp in the tψc stem,  <dig> bp in the anticodon stem, and  <dig> to  <dig> bp in the dihydrouridine  stem. some trnas showed dhu-loop replacement , as also found in l. viridis and p. cf. peregrina. in general, the lack of a dhu arm in two serine trnas is a common condition in metazoan mtdnas  <cit> . the presence of such aberrant trna genes in mitochondrial genomes could be due to modification of trna secondary structure by replication slippage  <cit> , or selection for mitochondrial genome minimization  <cit> .

the mtdnas of nemerteans investigated to date all have  <dig> trnas on the l strand and  <dig> trnas on the h strand . secondary structures of nemertean trnas are presented and compared in figures  <dig> and  <dig> . table  <dig> presents the trna lengths and the percent of identical nucleotides  for the six nemerteans.

nucleotide conservation was strongest on the h strand, with trnc, trng and trnm, having the highest levels of nucleotide conservation , followed by trne, trnl <dig>  trnq, trns <dig>  trnv and trny at  <dig> ≤ %inuc ≤  <dig> . the ten remaining trnas had %inuc values between  <dig> and 40; eight - trnd, trnf, trnh, trni, trnk, trnl <dig>  trns <dig> and trnw - are located on the h strand, while two - trnp and trnt - are on the l strand. h-strand genes trna, trnn and trnr had %inuc values ≤ <dig> 

conservation was positively h strand-biased, but no other pattern could be identified with respect to location of trnas along the genome. two of the three most conserved trnas, trnc and trnm, are adjoining, while the third, trng, adjoins the moderately conserved trne and is relatively close to the three least conserved genes, trna, trnn and trnr . as observed by others , there was no self-evident link between abundance of codon families and the level of trna conservation, with the most abundant codon families  not having the highest %inucs .

a few mismatched nucleotide pairs  were found in the acceptor and/or the discriminator arms, without regard to the overall level of conservation of the trnas. as recently pointed out by negrisolo et al.  <cit>  for arthropods, metazoan mtdnas commonly have such mismatches. it has been suggested that these may be corrected via rna-editing mechanisms  or they may represent unusual pairings  <cit> .

among the most conserved trnas in nemerteans, as in insects , nucleotide substitutions are mostly confined to tΨc and dhu loops and extra arms , with 2- <dig> fully compensatory base changes  or hemi-cbcs  on acceptor and anticodon stems . as in insects  <cit> , the number of cbcs and hemi-cbcs increased in stems as overall variation increased, especially in the tΨc stem.

as found in insects, cbcs and hemi-cbcs characterized either single species or taxa at a higher taxonomic rank. an example of the first type is the a-t pair found in the trnc acceptor arm of p. cf. peregrina, which was mirrored by g-c in all other nemerteans . few substitutions were present among c. hongkongiensis and cephalothrix sp. . an example of a full cbc characterizing a unique family is the a-t pair found in the acceptor stem of trnl1s of family lineidae , while other taxa exhibited the g-c pair . similarly, a full cbc in the anticodon stem of trng of two hoplonemerteans characterizes another high-taxonomic rank . figures  <dig> and  <dig> depict several more examples. this points to the potential phylogenetic value of trna sequences, as demonstrated for other animal groups , especially when secondary structures are taken into account  <cit> . while encouraging, clearly we need substantially more nemertean mitochondrial genomes to test this assertion for nemerteans.

the anticodon usage of n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens was congruent with the corresponding trna genes of other nemerteans, with one exception. the anticodon of the trns <dig>  gene in n. cf. mirabilis, p. cf. peregrina and three cephalothrix species is gct, but it is tct in l. viridis and z. rubens. cameron et al.  <cit>  found that anticodon changes in trns <dig>   must have occurred in the common ancestor of the insect clade ischnocera, which was consistent with its phylogeny of lice. similarly, this may constitute a kind of "rare genomic change"  <cit>  in nemerteans and be a synapomorphy of lineidae.

as in all other metazoan mtdnas sequenced to date, n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens mtdnas contain genes for both small and large ribosomal subunit rnas . both genes are encoded by the same strand and are separated by trnv, as in many other metazoans. for n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens, respectively, the lengths of rrnl/rrns are 1178/ <dig> bp and 1248/ <dig> bp, and the a + t contents are  <dig> / <dig> % and  <dig> / <dig> %.

base composition and codon usage
the mtdna of many invertebrates is characterized by a composition bias showing high values of a% and t% over g% and c%. the overall a + t content of n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens  is consistent with those observed in other nemertean mitochondrial genomes. though sample size for nemerteans is small, the a + t values appear to be linked in less , as well as in more inclusive taxa  . this might indicate a phylogenetic signal in nemerteans.

another feature of metazoan mtdnas is asymmetry in nucleotide composition between the two strands, with one being rich in a and c, and the other being rich in t and g  <cit> . this asymmetry also is evident in the two nemertean mtdna genomes here, with the genes encoded on the coding strand showing a strong bias toward t over a and toward g over c, as seen in the four other nemerteans, which have similar skewnesses . this situation is common for mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  and may be due to the presence of asymmetric patterns of mutational changes between strands  <cit> , and has been related with nucleotide deamination of dna while transiently single-stranded during replication  and/or transcription  <cit> . the relative importance of the two contributing processes  remains to be assessed.

we follow the pattern of  <cit>  for displaying codon family abundance and relative synonymous codon usage  for available nemertean protein-coding genes . to avoid bias due to incomplete stop codons, all stop codons are excluded from the analysis. the six nemertean mtdnas use similar total numbers of non-stop codons , ranging from  <dig> in p. cf. peregrina to  <dig> in l. viridis. the codon families reveal a consistent pattern among the six nemertean species: the families with at least  <dig> cds per thousand cds  encompass an average  <dig> % ±  <dig> % of all cds , with cds rich in a + t favored over synonymous cds of lower a + t content . for instance, the tta codon accounts for a large majority of cds in the leu <dig> family. whereas representation of the leu <dig>  and leu <dig>  codon families in nemertean protein-coding genes differs greatly, that of ser <dig>  and ser <dig>  is less extreme.

the invertebrate mitochondrial genome codes for  <dig> amino-acid codons  <cit> . as pointed out for lepidoptera  <cit> , the total number of codons used seems to be linked to the a + t content, which is the case among the six nemertean genomes analyzed. thus, cephalothrix sp. mtdna has the highest % content  and uses only  <dig> codons, never using the four codons rich in g + c  . lineus viridis mtdna uses all  <dig> codons and has the lowest a + t% among known nemertean genomes.

the abundance of the four amino acid residues - leu, ile, phe and ser - is typical for invertebrate membrane proteins  <cit> , and they account here for more than  <dig> %  of residues comprising the  <dig> mitochondrial proteins. the leu and ile amino acids share hydrophobic lateral chains.

two- and four-fold degenerate codon usage was similarly biased, with a/t favored over g/c in the third position  and in agreement with the at-bias of protein-coding genes. since the nemertean mitochondrial genome is at-rich , it can be expected that codons ending in a or t will predominate. from the overall rscu values, it could be assumed that compositional constraints are the factor in shaping variation in codon usage among the genes in these mitochondrial genomes.

non-coding regions
metazoan mtdnas usually have lengthy non-coding regions varying in size from ~ <dig> bp to >  <dig> kbp  <cit> . the mtdnas of n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens contain a large number of unassigned nucleotides. there are  <dig> non-coding regions, with up to  <dig> nts, found throughout the n. cf. mirabilis mitochondrial genome. the at-rich region located between the nad <dig> and trns <dig> genes accounts for  <dig> nts and its at content is  <dig> %, which is higher than the remainder of the genome. zygeupolia rubens has up to  <dig> non-coding nts distributed in  <dig> regions. the at-rich region located between trnw and trns <dig> genes is  <dig> nts and has an at content of  <dig> %, which also is higher than the remainder of the genome.

in most metazoan mtdnas, the largest non-coding region is thought to contain signals for replication and transcription, and is thus referred to as the control region  <cit> . the non-coding region has an increased at composition, a characteristic typically used to identify origins of replication  <cit> . as in mtdna genomes of other nemerteans, the at-rich regions of n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens mtdnas have the potential to form secondary structures such as stems and loops , which are thought to play an important role in the early stages of the replication and transcription process  <cit> . additionally, the at-rich region in mtdna of n. cf. mirabilis contains the tandemly repeated sequences  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and several n and n homopolymer tracts. in mtdnas of z. rubens, we found the tandemly repeated sequences  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  similar tandem repeat units within the largest non-coding regions also were found in the nemerteans cephalothrix sp.  <cit> , and c. hongkongiensis  <cit> . tandem repeats are common within the control region of animal mtdnas  <cit>  and might be associated with regulatory mechanisms and recombination hot spots, and they might be the result of replication slippage events  <cit> . the high at content and the predicted secondary structures of the at-rich non-coding region of the n. cf. mirabilis and z. rubens mtdnas suggest that this region most likely contains the control region, though the control region in invertebrates, unlike that of vertebrates, is not well characterized and lacks discrete and conserved sequence blocks used in identification  <cit> . the nemertean mtdna sequences examined here had multiple non-coding regions throughout their genomes. however, the location of the largest non-coding region is not conserved, and there is no obvious conservation of size , nucleotide identities or potential secondary structures for the nemertean non-coding regions.

gene order comparison
gene arrangements of the animal mitochondrial genome usually remain stable over long periods of evolutionary time, especially for protein-coding genes  <cit> . with some exceptions, mitochondrial gene order is relatively stable within major groups, and more variable between them  <cit> . this is the case for available nemertean mtdna genomes, with mitochondrial genes transcribed from the same strand except for trnp and trnt. among the three species of cephalothrix , the gene order is identical for two but that of c. rufifrons differs from them. the two hoplonemertean species  are identical to each other in gene order, as is the case for the two heteronemerteans . the hoplo- and the heteronemertean species differ only by a translocation of the gene block s2/nad <dig> but they differ significantly from the three cephalothrix species in the positions of atp <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> and several trnas. the highest number of common intervals  is between hoplo- and heteronemerteans, as indicated by results from crex  <cit> .

we use two different gene sets, "all genes" and "non-trna genes" to compare the mt gene orders of nemerteans to the proposed ground pattern of bilateria  <cit>  and to mitochondrial gene orders of various lophotrochozoans: terebratulina retusa   <cit> , katharina tunicata  <cit> , phoronis psammophila   <cit> , perionyx excavatus   <cit> , urechis caupo   <cit>  and sipunculus nudus  <cit> . for the "all genes" set, all nemerteans share the adjacency nad4l/nad <dig> with the ground pattern of bilateria and with the selected species . nemerteans share the adjacencies rrns/v/rrnl with bilateria and the other species except u. caupo. the adjacency h/nad <dig> is shared by nemerteans and the selected species. based on both gene sets, the hetero- and hoplonemerteans share the adjacency nad6/cob with k. tunicata  <cit> , p. psammophila  <cit> , p. excavatus  <cit> , u. caupo  <cit> , and s. nudus  <cit>  and they share the adjacency atp8/atp <dig> with t. retusa, k. tunicata and the putative ground pattern of bilateria . these adjacencies may be a common plesiomorphic feature of lophotrochozoa, such as mollusca, brachiopoda, and also arthropoda mitochondrial genomes . however, neither of the latter two adjacencies is present in two cephalothrix species, nor in the bryozoan flustrellidra hispida  <cit> .

in addition to visual comparison of genome maps, we analyzed gene order data with crex  <cit> , determining the number of common intervals. as shown in table  <dig>  the nemerteans share the highest number of common intervals  with k. tunicata and with p. psammophila , while the lowest number was obtained in comparison with u. caupo . although not significant, nemerteans and t. retusa, k. tunicata, and p. excavatus yield the highest numbers  in comparison with the putative bilaterian ground pattern.

*bold numbers represent pairwise common interval distances between mitochondrial gene orders , while italic numbers represent pairwise common interval distances between mt gene orders without trnas

excluding trnas, the gene order of heteronemerteans is identical to that of t. retusa  <cit>  and some gastropods, e.g., conus textile  <cit> , ilyanassa obsoleta  <cit> , thais clavigera  <cit>  and lophiotoma cerithiformis  <cit> . other molluscs, like the polyplacophoran k. tunicata  <cit> , the gastropod haliotis rubra  <cit>  and the cephalopod octopus vulgaris  <cit>  show a similar gene order, but are distinguished by a large inversion of about half the mt genome . without trnas, heteronemerteans and t. retusa, which has the same gene order, share the greatest number of possible common intervals  , and both share the greatest number  with the putative bilaterian ground pattern.

we also determined breakpoints and reversal distances between these taxa with the two gene sets . for "all genes", hetero- and hoplonemerteans share the same breakpoint distance  and the same reversal distance   with respect to the putative bilaterian ground pattern. heteronemerteans have the lowest values among the nemerteans when trnas are excluded from the analysis. these comparisons with the putative bilaterian ground pattern and with other lophotrochozoans gene orders , suggest that the heteronemertean gene order is likely to be closest to the ancestral mitochondrial gene order of nemertea. this is in agreement with a previous study  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of protein-coding genes to better understand relationships within the nemertea. the phylogenetic tree in figure  <dig>  reconstructed by maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses, indicates that similar gene arrangements reflect close phylogenetic affinity. this supports previous hypotheses that hoplonemertea and heteronemertea are sister taxa . however, a phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences  suggests hoplonemertea as sister group to palaeonemertea. this contradicts many but not all previous analyses . we consider it unsupported by our data, given the low bayesian posterior probability  for this clade. this suggests, however, that amino acid sequence data deserve continued attention in future analyses with new, additional data.

CONCLUSIONS
to date, complete or nearly complete mtdna sequences have been determined for seven nemerteans, a very small sampling compared to those available for vertebrates or arthropods. the two new mtdna genomes, for nectonemertes cf. mirabilis and zygeupolia rubens, share substantial similarity with those of other nemertean mitochondrial genomes, and gene content and a + t richness is similar to those common for animal mtdnas.

there is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between the two strands.

the evolution of nemertean trnas seems to have been variable both in terms of sequence conservation and nucleotide substitution processes. the presence of full and hemi-cbcs characterizing taxa at different taxonomic levels may indicate the potential phylogenetic value of trna sequences.

nemertean mtdnas are punctuated by non-coding portions highly variable in size. among them, the at-rich non-coding region, which appears to be a fast-evolving genomic region characterized by short to medium-size repeated motifs/at-rich patterns, may be associated with the initiation of replication or transcription.

phylogenetic analysis supports the close phylogenetic affinities in nemerteans one might infer from similarities in gene arrangements, with hetero- and hoplonemerteans as sister-clades. gene order analysis suggests that the heteronemertean pattern most closely resembles the likely ancestral condition among nemerteans, which is counterintuitive in light of the phylogenetic analysis. confidence that we understand evolution of the nemertean mitochondrial genome is likely to require investigating many more nemertean mtdnas, especially a full representation of palaeonemertean diversity.
