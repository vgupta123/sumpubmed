BACKGROUND
preharvest sprouting is observed across all major wheat growing regions in the world. in western canada, the average annual losses due to phs are approximately $ <dig> million  <cit> . insufficient seed dormancy is one major factor contributing to pre-harvest sprouting losses, particularly under humid, wet weather conditions at harvest. phs resistant/tolerant wheat cultivars and land races have been identified globally, with origins mainly in canada, usa, australia, china, japan, south africa, kenya and new zealand  <cit> . canadian red-seeded spring wheat cultivars  and white spring wheat genotypes  are known to carry resistance to phs, all having derived their resistance alleles from a red-seeded breeding line rl <dig>  <cit> .

of the three phs traits, fn  <cit>  is most commonly used to quantify phs  <cit>  and indirectly measures the activity of the enzyme α-amylase that breaks down starch in germinating grains. degradation of grain-starch as the result of greater α-amylase activitys result in lower fn values and are an indirect indication of low levels of phs resistance or dormancy. two other important traits for the characterization of phs are gi  <cit>  and si  <cit> . while gi values deduced from seed-germination tests in petri dishes are a direct measure of seed dormancy, si values obtained via artificial wetting of intact wheat spikes, detect dormancy and properties of the inflorescence that affect phs  <cit> .

quantitative trait loci  linked to phs traits have been reported on all  <dig> hexaploid wheat chromosomes  <cit> , mainly on 3a  <cit> , 3b and 3d  <cit> , 4a  <cit> , 5a  <cit> , 6b and 7d  <cit> . of these, the phs qtl on 4a has consistently been identified in several different mapping populations. the rl4452/‘ac domain’ dh population has been extensively characterized for qtl detection of phs  <cit> , agronomic  <cit>  and quality traits  <cit> , in several past studies that involved a small number of molecular markers. these studies relied mainly on ssr marker data for the preparation of genetic maps and locating qtl on chromosomes. with low costs and rapid advancements in sequencing technology, thousands of molecular markers, mainly snps have become available in wheat. additionally, access to genome sequence information for rice  <cit>  and brachypodium  <cit>  will now facilitate comparative mapping for the identification of genes underlying various important quantitative traits in wheat.

interaction among phs qtl , and the environment  have been reported from various studies  <cit>  aimed at understanding the complex genetic structure of qtl. as chromosomal locations of phs qtl are not uniform across populations, obtaining a consensus on the precise genomic location of important trait qtl is required for fine mapping and cloning studies. meta-qtl or meta-analysis  <cit>  integrates several qtl studies of a common trait to provide a meaningful estimate of the exact location and number of qtl for that given trait. eight phs qtl on chromosomes 3a, 3b, 3d and 4a were identified in a meta-qtl study  <cit>  involving  <dig> different populations .

a high level of genome-synteny exists among wheat, brachypodium and rice, with wheat being more closely related to brachypodium than to rice  <cit> . conservation or collinearity of genetic markers  <cit>  and greater structural similarities in the coding regions of orthologous genes  <cit>  of wheat and brachypodium have been reported. however, given differences in gene content in orthologous regions of wheat, brachypodium  <cit>  and rice  <cit> , it might be beneficial to use both genomic sequences of brachypodium and rice in comparative mapping studies for map based cloning and gene discovery in wheat.

our study deployed snp markers from a 90k infinium iselect custom beadchip  <cit> , in addition to available ssr, dart and ests, to generate high density genetic maps for the identification of phs resistance qtl. sequences corresponding to polymorphic snps flanking phs qtl were analyzed against genomic sequences of brachypodium and rice. the objectives of our research were a) to identify candidate genes and regions in brachypodium and rice that are orthologous to phs resistance qtl intervals in wheat, and b) to utilize sequences of snps flanking phs qtl to develop kasp markers for mas of phs resistance.

RESULTS

phs datasets were analyzed with both mim and simple interval mapping  methods. as results of both methods were very similar, only those of mim were reported in this study. the mim  <cit>  analysis identified four qtl with significant effects, located across chromosomes 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d. each of these four qtl appeared in two or more environments and had peak lod scores greater than the critical threshold lod at 5% significance levels   <cit> . coincident qtl for gi, si and fn were located on chromosome 4a. across trials, rl <dig> alleles on 3b and 7b provided phs resistance as they reduced si. however, ‘ac domain’ alleles also provided phs resistance as they increased fn on 4a and 7d  and reduced si and gi on 4a .table  <dig>

brachypodium/rice candidates for phs resistance orthologous to consensus regions on wheat chromosomes 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d  were identified. in the 3b region there are  <dig> genes in the brachypodium orthologous region and  <dig> in the rice region. the 4a region had  <dig> genes in the brachypodium region and  <dig> in rice, while the 7b region had  <dig> in brachypodium and  <dig> in rice and the 7d region had  <dig> in brachypodium and  <dig> in rice. genes involved in aba and ga metabolism as well as those affecting flowering time were present in the qtl regions. among these were bradi2g49795/os01g <dig> , os01g <dig>  os01g <dig>  orthologous to chromosome 3b, bradi1g00950/os03g <dig> , os03g <dig>  os03g <dig>  orthologous to 4a, bradi1g46060/os06g <dig>  orthologous to 7b, bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig> , bradi1g <dig>  bradi1g <dig>  and bradi1g48830/os06g <dig>  orthologous to chromosome 7d.

discussion
the objectives of our research were to identify candidate regions for phs resistance qtl of wheat and develop kasp markers  from sequences of snps flanking such qtl. this is an important step in the process of map-based cloning of genes that underlie important quantitative traits like phs resistance. our objectives were achieved using  <dig>  snps from the 90 k infinium custom beadchip to develop a high density linkage map in the rl4452/‘ac domain’ mapping population and subsequently detect qtl for phs resistance on chromosomes 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d. comparative mapping utilizing sequences of snps flanking phs resistance qtl enabled identification of candidate genes and regions in brachypodium and rice. the resulting  <dig> kasp markers can be deployed in future genetic studies of phs, and in evaluation of phs in germplasm and breeding material.

of the  <dig>  mapped markers,  <dig>  or  <dig> % were snp markers, while the remaining  <dig> or  <dig> % were ssr, dart and est markers. the b genome chromosomes accounted for the largest number of  <dig> snp markers, followed by the a genome with  <dig> snps, and the d genome with  <dig> snp markers. a likely explanation for larger numbers of b genome snp markers could be the greater genetic diversity of b genome species when compared to the a and d genome species  <cit> . a faster rate of evolution of the b genome due to greater polymorphism and duplication events, in addition to greater genetic diversity brought about by cross pollination were cited  <cit>  as possible explanations for findings of a greater number of ests associated with more unique loci on the b genome when compared to the a and d genomes.

phs datasets were analyzed with both mim and sim  methods. because results of both methods were very similar, only those of the mim analyses were reported. as qtl identified using mim were robust and supported by sim results, it is unlikely that additional large effect qtl involved in epistatic interactions might have been detected using other qtl mapping methods that detect both main effect  and epistatic qtl . further, a meta-qtl study  <cit>  reporting phs qtl on 4a and group  <dig> chromosomes support significant phs qtl identified on chromosome 3b and 4a of our study.

the most consistent of the four phs qtl identified on chromosomes 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d were located on chromosome 4a; gi, si and fn trait qtl each accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation in their respective traits. the qtl for these phs traits were coincident and maybe associated with the same gene. these findings might suggest that chromosome 4a is involved in regulation of phs trait qtl in our test population. previous reports of the association of phs traits with chromosome 4a  <cit> , support the importance of this qtl for phs

in addition to a major si qtl on 4a, two other qtl for si were identified on chromosomes 3b and 7b. <dig>  both si qtl on 3b and 7b. <dig> were detected in two of six environments. qtl that provide tolerance to late maturity α- amylase  have been mapped on 3bs and 7bl in an australian wheat cross cranbrook/halberd  <cit> . in both studies, the ssr markers xwmc <dig>  xwmc <dig>  xgwm <dig>  xwmc <dig>  xgwm <dig>  xwmc <dig>  xwmc <dig>  and xgwm <dig>  xwmc <dig>  xwmc <dig>  also flanked corresponding phs qtl intervals on chromosomes 3b. <dig> and 7b. <dig> respectively . further, alleles of a regulator gene vp-1b on 3b have been reported to influence grain dormancy in chinese wheat varieties  <cit> . in a follow up study  <cit> , the vp-1b locus was validated in a white-grained chinese landrace wanxianbaimaizi  using ssr markers and a gene-specific primer vp <dig>  a cim analysis identified a seed dormancy qtl qsd.ahau-3b on 3b flanked by vp <dig> which is linked to an ssr marker xwmc <dig> that also happens to flank the phs qtl interval on chromosome 3b of our study. the above findings suggest that phs and lma qtl on chromosomes 3b and 7b are likely the same.

‘ac domain’ alleles contributed to increasing the fn on 7d , with the exception of the glenlea  <dig> trial, wherein a negative additive score was observed for the fn. while the fn qtl on chromosome 7d is unique to our study, a significant time to maturity  qtl  also on 7d, and a positive contribution of the rl <dig> allele, has been reported previously by  <cit>  in the same rl4452/‘ac domain’ population. the authors reported an ssr marker xgwm <dig> tightly linked to this qtl, which is distally located on 7dl, and is  <dig>  cm from the qtl peak of our study. in the glenlea  <dig> trial , the average fn  score of  <dig> dh progeny was the lowest of the four trials . the low fn score at this location might suggest greater levels of phs of ‘ac domain’ genotypes, probably brought on by wet weather conditions at the maturity stages or during the three weeks preceding harvest  <cit> . as qtl locations of both these mat and fn traits nearly coincide and are influenced by negative and positive additive effects  of ‘ac domain’ alleles respectively, the action of a pleiotrophic locus regulating both fn and mat could be assumed. at glenlea in  <dig> it is possible that the lower fn for the domain allele is due to adverse weather conditions at maturity or that the 7d qtl identified here might not actually be a phs qtl, but rather a pleiotrophic effect of the mat qtl on phs.

flanking marker intervals of a given phs trait  qtl were not always the same across trials/datasets. it is quite likely that the respective underlying genes influencing each of these traits are the same; difference in qtl interval location being mainly due to environment or experimental error from differences in class means of individual trial data sets  <cit> . alternatively, the possibility of two closely linked loci controlling the same trait cannot be ruled out.

blastn searches with sequences of snp markers flanking phs qtl on chromosomes 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d revealed candidate regions in brachypodium and rice genomes. the qtl interval on chromosome 3b was orthologous to regions on bradi <dig> and the long arm of os <dig>  while qtl intervals on chromosomes 4a were orthologous to regions on bradi <dig> and the short arm of os <dig>  qtl intervals on chromosome 7b. <dig> and 7d. <dig> were orthologous to regions on bradi <dig> and the short arm of os <dig> of rice. the above findings of orthology between wheat/rice chromosomes: 3b/os <dig>  4a/os <dig> and 7b&7d/os <dig> concur with previous reports  <cit>  of wheat/rice chromosomal region similarities revealed via comparative mapping with dna probes and ests. further, orthologies between phs qtl intervals of 4a, 7b, 7d and genomic regions of bradi <dig>  and 3b/bradi <dig> in our study will be refined to tease out individual genes responsible for variation in phs resistance. the availability of information on whole-genome  <dig> assembled gene sequences of chinese spring  <cit>  and gene-orthologies among the said wheat and brachypodium chromosomes established using  <dig> ests mapped to wheat deletion bins  <cit>  will serve as useful references to complement our efforts.

eighteen kasp markers were developed from snp sequences flanking qtl for phs resistance. identical genotype calls of infinium snp data enabled validation of the  <dig> kasp markers and identified four  progeny genotypes of the rl4452/‘ac domain’ population possessing phs resistance on all four qtl on 3b, 4a, 7b and 7d . criteria for selection of these genotypes was based on findings of our study: ‘ac domain’  reduced gi and si on 4a, increased fn on 4a and 7d, while rl <dig>  reduced si on chromosomes 3b and 7b. further, these  <dig> kasp markers can be deployed in future genetic studies of phs, and in evaluation of phs in germplasm and breeding material.

genes present in brachypodium and rice in orthologous regions corresponding to the qtl were identified . the 3b region is large and contains over  <dig> genes in brachypodium and over  <dig> in rice. more markers are needed to reduce the size of the region and the emerging reference sequence of chromosome 3b  will be a valuable resource. there are a number of aba-inducible genes  which could be a starting point to search for additional markers.

the 4a and 7b regions contain many fewer genes in brachypodium and rice than the 3b region. gibberellin  <dig> oxidase   <cit>  on bradi1/os <dig> orthologous to 4a and abscissic acid responsive elements   <cit>  on bradi1/os <dig> orthologous to chromosome 7b are candidates worth further study. ga <dig> - oxidase has previously been considered as a candidate gene underlying phs qtl on 4a  <cit> .

on chromosome 7d the qtl was coincident with a previously identified maturity qtl in the same population . genes affecting flowering time are present in the orthologous regions in brachypodium and rice. these include the far-red impaired responsive  related proteins  <cit>  on chromosome bradi <dig>  as well as vrn1-ap2/b3-like transcription factors  <cit>  on bradi <dig> and phosphatidylethanolamine - binding protein  homologous to the flowering locus t gene  <cit>  on bradi1/os <dig>  orthologous to chromosome 7d.

because our study utilized a large number of sequence-based snps not available for previous mapping studies, the resulting genetic maps and qtl flanking snp markers are a novel and current resource for identification of underlying genes based on synteny and collinearity to model species brachypodium and rice. further, the identification of candidate genes and regions for phs in brachypodium and rice will enable a targeted focus for selection of candidate genes whose physiological/biological functions are linked to or influence variation in phs traits under study. such candidate gene-specific pcr markers will be developed and validated via mapping to the qtl intervals for phs resistance in wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study we utilized snps from a wheat 90 k infinium iselect custom beadchip that permitted detection and assignment of significant phs resistance qtl to specific chromosomal locations on genetic maps. sequences of snps flanking phs resistance qtl enabled identification of candidate genes and regions for phs in brachypodium and rice via comparative mapping. the  <dig> kasp markers resulting from this study can be suitably deployed in future genetic studies of phs and might also be useful in the evaluation of phs in germplasm and breeding material.
