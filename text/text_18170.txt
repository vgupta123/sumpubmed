BACKGROUND
gtfb is a novel family gh <dig> enzyme isolated from the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus reuteri  <dig>  <cit> . the gtfb protein sequence is similar to that of the glucansucrase gtfa of l. reuteri  <dig> , but these structurally related proteins have different enzymatic activities  <cit> . unlike the common gh <dig> glucansucrases, gtfb is inactive on sucrose, but acts as a  <dig> -α-glucanotransferase: it cleaves an α1 →  <dig> glycosidic linkage at the non-reducing end of a starch or malto-oligosaccharide  chain, and transfers the glucose to the non-reducing end of another  molecule, predominantly forming α1 →  <dig> glycosidic linkages, yielding mixtures of linear malto-/isomalto-oligosaccharide chains  <cit> . gtfb also has a relatively low hydrolysis activity. the gtfb final products are very interesting functional carbohydrates, acting as prebiotic oligosaccharides and soluble dietary fiber  <cit> . the enzymatic conversion of the widely available and low cost substrate starch by gtfb yields potentially valuable food ingredients and provides interesting opportunities for industrial applications  <cit> .

heterologous expression of gtfb in e. coli renders a low amount of soluble gtfb protein and a large amount of gtfb in inclusion bodies  as described previously for the related gtfml <dig> enzyme  <cit> . ibs are generated by protein aggregation, resulting in inactive enzymes, and are commonly observed in heterologous expression systems  <cit> . several studies have shown that active enzymes may be isolated from ibs through proper processing  <cit> . the conventional method involves refolding of the denatured protein. in the first step the misfolded protein is unfolded, followed by a second, gentle, refolding step  <cit> . several successful refolding methods have been developed, such as dilution, on-column chromatography, dialysis, ultra-filtration and procedures involving multiple steps  <cit> . success in protein refolding, however, varies strongly, and these procedures are often time consuming and relatively expensive  <cit> .

interestingly, in case of gtfb, we detected its enzyme activity in the ibs, which therefore were renamed into non-classical inclusion bodies   <cit> . activity of ib aggregated enzymes may reflect the presence of a percentage of properly folded functional protein  <cit> . another viewpoint, the “ib-stretch hypothesis”, poses that ibs may include functional enzyme domains, and that crucial residues for active protein conformation are not engaged in the inactive β-core of the aggregates  <cit> . these ibs also provide enough pore space for substrate and product molecules  <cit> . functional proteins in ncibs thus can be applied directly; one example is the human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor  <cit> . these ncibs may have additional advantages over solubilized protein, such as high stability and relatively large particle size, useful for enzyme immobilization and preparation of nanomaterials  <cit> .

heterologous expression attempts with l. reuteri  <dig> -α-glucanotransferase enzymes  in e. coli yielded low amounts of soluble protein  <cit> . however, expression of gtfb in e. coli bl <dig> star  resulted in an abundant accumulation of gtfb in ibs, as described in this study. here we report the results of a comparison of soluble gtfb and ncib gtfb with enzyme preparations obtained by refolding of gtfb protein extracted from ibs, with emphasis on their activity, product specificity and thermostability.

RESULTS
gtfb accumulates as soluble protein and in inclusion bodies 
heterologous expression of gtfb in e. coli bl <dig> star  resulted in relatively abundant synthesis of this protein but mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. as shown in table  <dig>  this e. coli expression system yielded approximately 150–225 mg of total cell protein per liter of culture, more than 50 % of which was the target gtfb protein. however, more than 90 % of total gtfb protein accumulated in ibs .table  <dig> the yields of total cell protein, and total, soluble, insoluble gtfb, obtained from e. coli



e.coli bl <dig> star  cells grown at different temperatures, and the percentages of insoluble gtfb within the inclusion bodies  were determined by bio-rad protein assay and densitometric analysis of sds-page separated proteins. all cell samples were harvested at a culture od <dig> of  <dig> . the experiments were done in duplicate



using different induction temperatures, the yields of total protein, soluble and insoluble gtfb protein varied in cultures harvested at the same od <dig> value of  <dig> . the yield of soluble gtfb increased from  <dig>  mg/l at 37 °c to  <dig>  mg/l at 25 °c, but no further increase occurred at 18 °c. after his-tag affinity purification, only approx. 1 mg pure gtfb was obtained from 1 l culture incubated at  <dig> or 25 °c. the highest amount of insoluble gtfb  was produced at 30 °c, while the purest  insoluble gtfb was obtained at 25 °c.

comparison of hydrolysis and transferase activities of soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb
the ifold protein refolding matrix with  <dig> different buffers was used to determine the optimal refolding conditions for gtfb ibs. refolding efficiency was assessed by measuring hydrolysis activity . as shown in fig.  <dig>  refolding was more successful at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  compared to ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . double distilled  h2o at ph  <dig>  without any additives and buffer salts was the optimal refolding environment. through dd h2o refolding,  <dig>  % hydrolysis activity was recovered compared to soluble gtfb . in addition, among all the refolding conditions tested, conditions with methyl-β-cyclodextrin all resulted in higher efficiency than the ones without methyl-β-cyclodextrin . conceivably, the hydrophobic areas of the gtfb protein are exposed during the folding process and addition of methyl-β-cyclodextrin suppresses the stacking of protein folding intermediates  <cit> .fig.  <dig> bargraphs of the relative activities of soluble, refolded and different ncib gtfb enzymes. the refolded gtfb enzymes were obtained from various refolding buffers, and the non-classical inclusion bodies  gtfb were expressed at different temperatures . all enzyme concentrations used were 100 μg/ml. the enzyme activity was defined as the release of glucose from maltoheptaose at 37 °c and ph  <dig> . the hydrolysis activity of soluble gtfb was set at 100 % . the total hydrolysis and transferase activities of soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb enzymes obtained from one liter e. coli culture expressing gtfb are shown in bargraphs  and . in  100 % activity corresponds to  <dig>  u hydrolysis activity and in  the 100 % value corresponds to a transferase activity of  <dig>  u in 1 l culture



non-classical inclusion body  research shows that the presence of active protein inside ibs strongly depends on the e. coli growth temperature  <cit> . an example is the expression of human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in e. coli: compared to 37 °c expression at 25 °c resulted in higher amounts of correctly folded protein inside ibs  <cit> . using equal amounts of protein, four ncib gtfb samples obtained at different e. coli growth temperatures displayed relatively low hydrolysis activity in comparison to the soluble and refolded gtfb enzymes . the gtfb activity  of the most active 25 °c ncibs gtfb was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of that of the soluble and dd h2o refolded gtfb, respectively. to exclude any effect from e. coli proteins, e. coli harboring the pet15b-gtfbd1015n  was used as a negative control  <cit> .

based on the yield of 1 l culture, gtfb ncibs contained around 180 % hydrolysis activity and 100 % transferase activity compared to soluble gtfb . thus ratios of hydrolysis versus transferase activity  of ncib and refolded gtfb were relatively high compared to soluble gtfb. the activity obtained from the total yield of refolded protein in one liter culture is much higher , but the production costs for refolded proteins are estimated to be around  <dig> times higher than for ncib proteins  <cit> . the ncib gtfb proteins show sufficient activity to replace refolded gtfb protein as functional gtfb enzyme.

comparison of product profiles of soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb enzymes incubated with maltose and maltotriose
soluble , refolded  and 25 °c ncib gtfb  samples with equivalent gtfb hydrolysis activity  were incubated with 50 mm maltose or maltotriose at ph  <dig>  and 37 °c for 72 h, and their product profiles were analyzed by hpaec . the product profiles from soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb enzymes were very similar. the generated products were identified based on earlier research by dobruchowska et al.  <cit> . the structures are depicted in fig. 2c. in fig. 2a, two main peaks  identified in all spectra represent glucose and panose, products derived from maltose by hydrolysis and transferase activities. the other reaction products labelled as peak 4a and  <dig> were panose elongated with one and two -linked glucose residues at the non-reducing site. also after incubation with maltotriose , the product profiles of soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb were highly similar when comparing peaks  <dig> to  <dig>  the structures of these products  indicate that the larger oligosaccharides resulted from elongation with not only α1 →  <dig> but also α1 →  <dig> linkages. these data showed that refolded and ncib gtfb enzymes have the same product and reaction specificity as soluble gtfb, catalyzing hydrolysis and α1 → 4/α1 →  <dig> transglycosylation.fig.  <dig> comparison of hpaec-pad profiles of the product mixtures of different gtfb preparations. 50 mm maltose  and maltotriose  were seperately incubated with gtfb preparations with equal hydrolysis activity  after 72 h at 37 °c and ph  <dig> . the oligosaccharide structures produced were identified  according to dobruchowska et al.  <cit> . g <dig> to g <dig> represent glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetriose, maltopentaose, maltohexaose and maltoheptaose, respectively



additionally, nmr analysis  showed that the α1 →  <dig> linkage percentages of avebe md <dig>  modified by soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb enzymes during incubation for 3 days were highly similar, increasing in all cases from  <dig>  to around 15 %.fig.  <dig> one-dimensional 1h nmr spectra of avebe md <dig> and its products following incubation with gtfb preparations. the spectra were recorded in d2o at 300 k after the incubation of 5 % avebe md <dig>  with different gtfb preparations which have equal hydrolysis activity  after 72 h at 37 °c and ph  <dig> . rα/β represent the reducing –-d-glcp units and gα/β represent the d-glcp units



size analysis of avebe md <dig> and its products after gtfb enzyme treatments
the size exclusion chromatograms  of avebe md <dig> before and after incubation with soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb proteins are shown in fig.  <dig>  the elution volume in sec is directly related to the hydrodynamic volume of the linear and branched molecules  <cit> . the elution volumes of some pullulan standards are plotted at the x-axis. since avebe md <dig> is mainly composed of short oligosaccharides , its major peak is seen at a high elution volume . after incubation with gtfb preparations with equivalent hydrolysis activity, the peak at  <dig>  ml decreased and shifted to a bi-modal peak at elution volumes of approximately  <dig> and 32 ml, demonstrating that the short oligosaccharides in md <dig> substrate were converted to products with higher molecular weight. the distributions of the products of soluble, ncib and refolded gtfb were highly similar. the relatively high ratios of hydrolysis versus transferase activity  of ncib and refolded gtfb compared to soluble gtfb may initially result in enhanced synthesis of smaller products. this increased availability of shorter acceptor substrates resulted in reduced average sizes of their product molecules.fig.  <dig> sec chromatograms of avebe md <dig> and its products following incubation with gtfb preparations. different gtfb preparations with equal hydrolysis activity  were incubated with 5 % avebe md <dig> for 72 h at 37 °c and ph  <dig> . elution volumes of the pullulan standards corresponding to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, are plotted above the x-axis



fourier transform infrared  studies
the secondary structures of the soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb  proteins were examined by infrared spectroscopy . the frequency and the shape of the amide i bands in the spectral region between  <dig> and 1620 cm− <dig> provides information about the type of secondary structure present in proteins  <cit> . because the components in amide i, resulting from different secondary structure elements, are strongly overlapping , a second derivative analysis was applied. the main band, at 1653 cm− <dig> in second derivative spectra  indicates the presence of α-helical structures, which may be expected for a gh <dig> family enzyme containing a tim barrel fold with  <dig> α-helices  <cit> . the ncibs gtfb show distinctive bands at  <dig> and 1695 cm− <dig>  with higher intensity than those of soluble and refolded gtfb, indicating that the inclusion bodies have more intermolecular β-sheet structure  <cit> . the fi-ir spectra of the inclusion bodies also show peaks at  <dig> and 1653 cm− <dig>  suggesting they also contain some native β-sheet and native α-helix structures of the soluble gtfb enzyme, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> fourier transform infrared  spectra in the amide i region of different gtfb preparations. soluble gtfb, refolded gtfb, and ncib gtfb proteins isolated from e. coli incubated at different temperatures  were analyzed.  ft-ir spectra;  second derivatives of the ft-ir spectra



thermostability comparison of soluble, ncib and refolded gtfb proteins
to compare the thermostability of soluble, ncib and refolded gtfb proteins, their residual activity was measured after incubation at 45 °c for several time intervals. at a protein concentration of 75 μg/ml, the half-lives of soluble and refolded gtfb were around  <dig>  min . the half-life of ncib gtfb protein was  <dig> -fold longer. even after 30 min incubation, 20 % of the original activity of ncib gtfb enzyme remained, while soluble and refolded gtfb enzymes had become completely inactivated. when comparing the three gtfb protein preparations in different concentrations but with the same hydrolysis activity , the half-life of ncib gtfb was  <dig>  times longer than those of soluble and refolded gtfb . this is probably due to the extended β-sheet formation in ncib gtfb protein by amino acid chains which are remote to the active site stabilizing its overall conformation. thus, with increasing temperatures, domains outside the active site important for stable protein conformation may be more slowly affected in ncib gtfb protein than in soluble and refolded gtfb proteins.fig.  <dig> thermostability of soluble gtfb, refolded gtfb, and 25 °c ncib gtfb proteins. different gtfb preparactions incubated at the same protein concentration  and with the same hydrolysis activity , were assessed separately by measuring their residual activities after incubation at 45 °c up to 30 min. the activity before incubation was set at 100 %



CONCLUSIONS
this paper reports that the lactobacillus reuteri  <dig> gtfb protein is highly expressed in the heterologous host e. coli, but largely accumulates in non-classical inclusion bodies , displaying hydrolysis and transferase activity. e. coli growth temperatures of  <dig> and 30 °c resulted in ncib preparations with highest gtfb yield, purity and activity. following denaturing, refolding of gtfb protein in double distilled h2o resulted in highest recovery of gtfb  activity, but required a set of complicated procedures. the ncib gtfb enzyme produced at 25 °c displayed  <dig>  % of the soluble gtfb  activity and produced similar product profiles from maltose, maltotriose and avebe md <dig>  ft-ir analysis of soluble, refolded and ncib gtfb proteins confirmed that structural differences exist between these gtfb proteins. the ncib gtfb enzyme was much more thermostable than the soluble and refolded gtfb enzymes. in view of its high yield, low preparation cost and structural stability, ncib gtfb protein thus provides a promising option for industrial applications.
