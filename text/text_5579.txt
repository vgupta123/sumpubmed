BACKGROUND
more and more mammals have been successfully cloned by somatic cell nuclear transfer   <cit> . the new technology attracts great interest because of its potential applications in biomedicine and husbandry  <cit> . however, cloned animals show many abnormalities including low birth rate, placental dysfunctions and large offspring syndrome  <cit> , which collectively appear to be a great barrier to efficient cloning. in scnt, somatic nuclei must be remodeled from highly differentiated somatic patterns to a totipotent embryonic pattern in order to support early development. this process is called epigenetic reprogramming  <cit>  and is regarded as a reverse of cell differentiation  <cit> . the reprogramming process is crucial for embryo cloning and determines whether development will continue  <cit> . it is generally held that incomplete or aberrant reprogramming of donor somatic cell nuclei results in low cloning efficiency and developmental abnormalities.

dna methylation and histone modification play important roles in genome reprogramming and expression of genes that control animal development. dna methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome and is crucial for genomic stability. it usually occurs at the 5' position of cytosine in symmetrical 5'-cpg-3' dinucleotides. clusters of cpgs, termed cpg islands  <cit> , are found in the promoter or the first exon of a gene in most cases  <cit> . generally, methylation of cpg islands represses the initiation of transcription  <cit> . histone amino termini are subject to many dynamic sets of covalent modifications that are thought to be involved in modulating important physiological activities including gene expression  <cit> . one such modification, histone acetylation, generally takes place in active chromatin regions and is associated with the activation of gene expression. it participates in regulating transcription during the development of preimplantation embryos.

epigenetic abnormalities in dna methylation and histone acetylation are common in cloned mammalian embryos or fetuses. a genome-wide reduction in cytosine methylation has been observed in cloned fetuses  <cit> . defective demethylation and precocious de novo methylation on a genome-wide scale, and aberrant demethylation of some repetitive dna elements, have been observed in preimplantation embryos  <cit> . furthermore, dna methylation of igf <dig> dmrs not only vary in different tissues but are also extensively changed during the perinatal period in normal mouse tissues <cit> . higher levels of histone acetylation were observed in swamp buffalo scnt embryos than in in vitro fertilized  embryos at the 4- and 8-cell stages  <cit> . the levels of acetylated histone h4-lysine  <dig> at the 8-cell stage were lower in cloned than in ivf bovine embryos, and it was suggested that these abnormalities may be caused by the memory of the somatic chromatin pattern  <cit> . these observations indicate that epigenetic abnormalities occur frequently during the early development of cloned embryos. however, little is known about dna methylation and histone acetylation in cloned mammals after birth or about the incidence of aberrant epigenetic modifications.

several genes have been shown to be crucial for embryo development, organogenesis and growth. β-actin is a housekeeping gene  <cit>  expressed in most eukaryotic cells and takes part in many physiological processes  <cit> . vascular endothelial growth factor  is a pivotal factor promoting the formation of blood vessels in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. the reduction in vegf expression during embryo development causes decreased angiogenesis and is ultimately lethal  <cit> . oct <dig> is a mammalian pou transcription factor and is expressed in all totipotent and pluripotent cells  <cit> . mammalian telomerase is essential for maintaining telomere length  <cit> , and the tert gene product is part of the catalytic core of this enzyme. imprinted genes play essential roles in the early development of mammals  <cit> . maternal expression of the histocompatibility gene  and paternal expression of insulin-like growth factor <dig>  are observed in cattle  <cit> . art <dig> is an alu-like repetitive element with at least  <dig>  copies in the bovine genome  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined dna methylation and histone h <dig> acetylation and expression in the six genes mentioned above, and in a repetitive sequence, in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney from cloned cattle that had died at different stages. we aimed to reveal epigenetic and gene expression changes in these clones.

as summarized in table  <dig>  abnormalities in histone h <dig> acetylation were observed in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney from both cloned groups. the ed group showed more abnormal histone h <dig> acetylation than the ld group. in heart, ed showed three aberrantly acetylatedes genes and ld showed one. in liver, spleen, lung and kidney, ed showed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> aberrantly acetylatedes genes respectively, and ld showed  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. in the ed group, the repetitive sequence art <dig> showed aberrant acetylation in all five organs, but in the ld group it was aberrantly acetylated only in liver and lung. in the ed group, β-actin, vegf, oct <dig>  tert, h <dig> and igf <dig> showed aberrant acetylation in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> organs respectively, while in the ld group they were aberrantly acetylated in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> organs respectively. these data suggest that histone h <dig> acetylation was more frequently abnormal in the ed group, which also showed more pathological organs .

expression of β-actin, vegf, h <dig> and igf2
oct <dig> is only expressed in the germ cells and during early embryo development  <cit> , and tert is not expressed in somatic cells  <cit> . we therefore only checked the expression of β-actin, vegf, h <dig> and igf <dig> in the five tissues  from normal and cloned cattle by real-time quantitative rt-pcr. the amplified products were identified by melting curve profile analysis and sequencing. the final data showed the relative transcript abundance of each target gene normalized to gapdh.

overall, dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression tended to be elevated in the cloned cattle
putting all the cloned cattle samples together, we found that dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression tended to be higher than in controls. the ratio of up-:down-regulation was 7: <dig> for dna methylation, 17: <dig> for histone h <dig> acetylation and 5: <dig> for gene expression.

discussion
many studies have suggested that incomplete or aberrant reprogramming of donor somatic cell nuclei, including abnormal dna methylation and histone acetylation, causes abnormal development of animal clones  <cit> . previous investigations of epigenetic reprogramming have mostly been performed on the genome scale. to date, changes in the epigenetic status of specific genes in embryos and organs of natal clones remain elusive. to our knowledge, this is the first time that dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression have been examined simultaneously for specific genes in cloned cattle.

we found aberrant dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression in different organs from two groups of cloned cattle. the ed group showed fewer severe dna methylation abnormalities than the ld group, though the abnormalities in histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression were more marked. overall, dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression tended to be greater in cloned cattle than in controls. our data also suggest that there are no widespread gene expression abnormalities in organs from clones that have died, so the death of clones may be ascribed to abnormal expression of a very limited number of pivotal genes.

abnormal expression of a few key genes suffices to cause severe consequences. carmeliet and ferrara found that lack of a single vegf allele was lethal in embryos  <cit> . disruption of imprinted genes  resulted in overgrowth of the fetus and placenta in mice  <cit>  and severe congenital disorders in humans such as beckwith-wiedemann syndrome , prader-willi syndrome  and angelman syndrome   <cit> . as aberrant expression of a few genes could cause the death of cloned cattle, these causal gene may be different in different cases. many studies have revealed aberrant expression of genes in cloned animals  <cit> , including imprinted genes  <cit> , x-linked genes  <cit> , apoptosis-related genes  <cit>  and other development-related genes. our data also reveal aberrant expression of imprinted genes and development-related genes in a few organs. although many gene expression abnormalities have been reported in clones, it is difficult to know to what extent these abnormalities could induce clone death.

dna methylation is important in regulating gene expression  <cit> . appropriate dna methylation is essential for normal gene function  <cit> . recent studies have revealed aberrant methylation of repetitive elements and imprinted genes in cloned embryos during preimplantation development  <cit> . in the present study, we found more severely aberrant dna methylation in the ld group than the ed group. it is well known that the mammalian genome undergoes two major rounds of epigenetic reprogramming: during germline development and during preimplantation development  <cit> . appropriate reprogramming of dna methylation in the early embryo is crucial for the subsequent development of cloned animals. we speculate that relatively normal reprogramming of methylation occurred during the early development of our cloned cattle, otherwise these animals would not have developed to term. on the other hand, it is reported that epigenetic status can be influenced by environmental factors  <cit> . as our results indicate that dna methylation was more variable in cloned cattle that died after the perinatal period than in those that died during that period, we speculate that variations in dna methylation after birth are sensitive to environmental factors.

more aberrant histone h <dig> acetylation changes were found in the ed group than in the ld group. these abnormalities of acetylation probably occurred randomly during the development of the cloned cattle. overall, however, there was a tendency towards greater histone h <dig> acetylation in the cloned cattle. in particular, the imprinted genes, h <dig> and igf <dig>  both showed elevated acetylation levels in all aberrant organs. the increased acetylation levels are noteworthy because crucial aspects of mammalian physiological activity such as reproduction, placentation and energy homeostasis are regulated by imprinted genes  <cit> . it is reasonable to speculate that if elevated h <dig> acetylation causes dramatic changes of expression of key gene, the animal will die or continue to develop abnormally.

more abnormal acetylation and variations in gene expression were observed in the ed group, which had more organ pathologies, suggesting a correlation between clone death and aberrant gene expression. a previous study showed that aberrant global histone acetylation of somatic chromatin began at the one-cell stage in scnt  <cit> . cloned embryos are more highly acetylated than controls in the trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage  <cit> . in dead cloned cattle, aberrant gene expression was found in many types of organs  <cit> . on the basis of these studies and our own observations, we conclude that histone acetylation and gene expression are reprogrammed randomly throughout early development in cloned animals. some incorrect reprogramming may be corrected during the development of preimplantation embryos, but uncorrected abnormal histone acetylation and gene expression will persist and may result in severe outcomes such as pathological organ changes in the clones. this speculation is consistent with the opinion that small reprogramming errors in redifferentiation can be magnified during the subsequent development of cloned embryos  <cit> .

it is generally known that gene expression is controlled by multiple factors  <cit> . dna methylation and histone h <dig> acetylation are only two of these factors. others such as histone h <dig> acetylation and histone methylation are also involved. these histone modifications interact cooperatively to regulate gene expression  <cit> . transcription factors also participate in the regulation of gene expression. our results suggest that histone h <dig> acetylation and dna methylation may cooperate with other factors to regulate gene expression. interactions among these factors may counteract the negative effect of one or more of them. in addition, there is a noticeable tendency for dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression to be elevated, and more data are required to reveal the exact influence of this tendency.

the extent of dna methylation and histone h <dig> acetylation in the genome as a whole, and the status of other histone modifications, are still unknown in newborn normal and cloned cattle. therefore, additional studies are needed to elucidate the significance of these unknown epigenetic variations in the development of normal and cloned cattle.

CONCLUSIONS
abnormal dna methylation, histone h <dig> acetylation and gene expression were found in five organs from both ed and ld cloned cattle groups in this research. however, our study showed that no generalized gene expression abnormalities detected in the dead clones. so, we postulate that the deaths of clones may be due to aberrant expression of a very limited number of genes.
