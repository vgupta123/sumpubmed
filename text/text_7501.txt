BACKGROUND
methane is a major greenhouse gas, accounting for up to 20-30% of global warming effect  <cit> . aerobic methanotrophic bacteria constitute the main microbial methane sink through their ability to derive energy from its oxidation to carbon dioxide using the key enzyme methane monooxygenase  <cit> . cultured representatives of this functional guild are phylogenetically positioned within the gammaproteobacteria , the alphaproteobacteria   <cit> , and the verrucomicrobia <cit> . these methanotrophs appear physiologically diverse, especially in regard to their nitrogen metabolism  <cit> , with strains demonstrating co-metabolic oxidization of ammonia  <cit> , nitrate reduction to nitrite  <cit> , detoxification of hydroxylamine and nitrite to the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide via a multitude of pathways  <cit> , and fixation of atmospheric nitrogen  <cit> .

the effect of nitrogen, under the form of either ammonium- or nitrate-based fertilizers, on methane fluxes in soils is a widely studied topic of global concern. unfortunately, available reports are not in agreement, with methanotrophic activity after nitrogen addition either showing no effect, inhibition  or stimulation , resulting in identical or altered associated community composition  <cit> . the currently accepted thesis assumes niche partitioning among methanotrophic species, with methane oxidation activity responses to changes in nitrogen content being dependent on the in situ methanotrophic community structure  <cit> .

unfortunately, widely applied tools for microbial community assessment, based on short read 16s rrna gene sequencing techniques or proxies thereof  or terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism ), only have a limited phylogenetic resolution mostly restricted to genus level diversity  <cit> , and not to species level as often mistakenly assumed. as a consequence, intragenus or intraspecies metabolic versatility in nitrogen metabolism was never evaluated nor considered among methanotrophic bacteria as a source of differential responses of methane oxidation to nitrogen amendments. nevertheless, we know from other organisms that ecophysiology can be strain-specific, and closely related bacteria can occupy distinct niches  <cit> . this was for example elaborately demonstrated in prochlorococcus, with cultured strains having distinct pigmentation, maximum growth rates, metal tolerances, nutrient utilizations and photophysiological characteristics  <cit> . also, among methanotrophic genera of the same type , ammonia co-metabolisation and product inhibition was found to be organism-specific, although in this study it is difficult to ascertain the taxonomic level at which differences occur as only two strains from different genera were tested for each type  <cit> .

we hypothesized that strains within the same methanotrophic genus, thus below the level at which most techniques assign operational taxonomic units , can demonstrate a large physiological versatility in their nitrogen metabolism. if so, this would make current microbial community structure analyses less suitable for evaluating changes in in situ methanotrophic communities after for example fertilization. to this end, we explored the differential response of various aspects of the nitrogen metabolism within fourteen genotypically distinct members of the genus methylomonas , including the species m. methanica and m. koyamae. their tolerance to high ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and hydroxylamine concentrations, their ability to fix nitrogen, and their capacity to produce nitrite and nitrous oxide from nitrate or ammonium were qualitatively evaluated. methylomonas is a relevant genus for such a comparison, since methylomonas strains are ubiquitous in nature  <cit>  and nitrogenous fertilization was reported to stimulate some of its members in rice field soils  <cit> . two non-methylomonas strains belonging to type ib and type ii were included as references.

RESULTS
n <dig> fixation
we screened a strain set of fourteen genotypically distinct methylomonas strains, one type ib strain  and one type ii strain  in batch experiments for their ability to fix dinitrogen gas as sole nitrogen source. only at low oxygen tension, ten out of the thirteen methylomonas strains could grow without any nitrogen source except for n <dig> in the headspace , confirming the presence of an oxygen sensitive nitrogenase. since oxygen became rapidly limiting in the batch setup used, volumes of air equal to the initial volume were injected  to allow further activity and growth of the cultures. maximum od600nm values averaged at  <dig>  ±  <dig>   across strains, while activity was observed with drops in methane and oxygen levels and subsequent increase in co <dig> levels . no growth or activity was observed for the strains cultivated in parallel in nitrogen-free medium under high oxygen tension, confirming the absence of nitrogenous compounds in the growth medium, which was also demonstrated by colorimetric analysis of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. to confirm observations, the presence of the nifh gene encoding the fe protein of nitrogenase was verified. all strains that did not give a nifh gene amplicon were also negative for growth and activity in nitrogen-free medium at high and low oxygen tension.

three tested methylomonas strains  were not active and did not grow in nitrogen-free medium under low oxygen tension during the 21-days experiment, although pcr and sequence analyses demonstrated the presence of a nifh gene. m. koyamae r- <dig> unexpectedly did not exhibit n <dig> fixation, although this strain shares a 100% 16s rrna and a >99% nifh sequence similarity with strains ncimb 14606t and r- <dig> , both positive for n <dig> fixation under low oxygen tension. m. lenta r- <dig> and r- <dig> typically grew slower than the other strains . therefore, it is possible that these strains would fix n <dig> after longer incubation periods.

assimilation of nitrate and ammonium and tolerance to high levels
assimilation of and/or tolerance to high levels of ammonium and nitrate was evaluated, in addition to the influence of general osmotic effects tested with equimolar concentrations of sodium chloride . these tests were qualitatively scored based on growth, which was used as a proxy for methane oxidation as both features were shown to correlate . this experiment was performed in microtiter plates, in which all strains could grow well, even though a more limited gas transfer is expected in such a setup compared with batch experiments due to a lack of mixing. the complete strain panel was able to use both ammonium and nitrate for assimilation and strains could cope in general with a maximum of 40 mm amended nitrogen, except the type ii strain, which only tolerated a maximum of 20 mm no3−-n .

two m. koyamae strains, r- <dig> and ncimb 14606t, showed a higher tolerance for nh4+-n, up to 100 mm. notably, growth at these high ammonium concentrations was not supported for m. koyamae r- <dig>  showing gene sequence similarity with m. koyamae ncimb 14606t and m. koyamae r- <dig> of 100% for the 16s rrna gene  and between 97-100% for the pmoa gene encoding the particulate methane monooxygenase, the key enzyme for methane oxidation . in addition, out of these three strains only r- <dig> exhibited higher sodium chloride tolerance when grown with ammonium as sole nitrogen source over nitrate . for m. methanica cultures, strains ncimb 11130t and r- <dig> exhibited higher salt tolerance when cultivated with nh4+-n instead of no3−-n. m. methanica r- <dig> was salt sensitive regardless of the nitrogen source and demonstrated an equal tolerance to sodium chloride, ammonium and nitrate . the other m. methanica strains tolerated higher sodium chloride concentrations than equimolar nitrate and ammonium concentrations, most likely due to compound-specific stress  <cit> . only m. lenta strains r- <dig> and r- <dig> grew in the presence of 100 mm nitrate and tolerated higher concentrations of nitrate than ammonium , whilst also showing the highest salt tolerance regardless of their nitrogen source . the other strains tolerated higher sodium chloride additions than equimolar nitrate additions, again suggesting concentration-dependent nitrate inhibition.

assimilation and toxicity of the potential intermediates nitrite and hydroxylamine
ammonium amendments introduce a fraction of ammonia to the culture depending on the ph . ammonia can be toxic to methanotrophs as it functions as a competitive inhibitor of mmo or leads to accumulation of hydroxylamine and nitrite, toxic products of its oxidation. tolerance of methanotrophs to ammonia can thus be dependent of intrinsic toxicity levels of hydroxylamine and nitrite as well as their ability to use either of them for assimilation. this was again tested qualitatively in microtiter plates using growth as a proxy for methane oxidation.

for our strain panel, preliminary experiments showed that none of the strains could grow with 1 mm or 2 mm hydroxylamine as sole nitrogen source. therefore, tolerance of hydroxylamine was tested by providing 2 mm ammonium for assimilation and spiking of  <dig>  mm, 1 mm and 2 mm hydroxylamine. none of the strains could grow in the presence of 2 mm hydroxylamine. eight strains exhibited growth when  <dig>  mm and 1 mm hydroxylamine was added, while eight other strains did not even show growth at a concentration of only  <dig>  mm hydroxylamine .

all methylomonas strains were able to grow with up to 2 mm nitrite as sole nitrogen source, demonstrating nitrite tolerance as well as assimilation. the type ib strain r- <dig> tolerated the highest nitrite concentration . however, this strain was sensitive to hydroxylamine, even at concentrations of  <dig>  mm. type ii strain could not use nitrite as sole nitrogen source.

production of nitrite and nitrous oxide from nitrate and ammonium
to evaluate nitrite and nitrous oxide production from nitrate or ammonium, strains were grown in batch cultures at an initially high oxygen tension . because of methanotrophic activity, oxygen concentrations gradually decreased to levels too low to support further methane oxidation, thus inducing stationary growth phase. most strains clearly produced nitrite  and nitrous oxide  from nitrate, while production of nitrous oxide, but not nitrite, from ammonium was also a general feature . nitrite production from ammonium was only apparent for methylosinus sp. r- <dig>  but near detection limit  for m. methanica r- <dig> and m. lenta r- <dig> and r- <dig>  the strain panel could be divided into eight different dissimilatory nitrogen phenotypes, based on detection of nitrite, nitrous oxide or both ; onset of n-species production or amount produced was not taken into account. an example of each phenotype is displayed in figure  <dig>  it should be noted that monitoring only started at late exponential phase , as preliminary experiments then showed the onset of nitrous oxide production. therefore, influence of nitrate or ammonium on actual methane oxidation rate was not assessed, although small amounts of methane were still consumed  and final methane concentration consumed with either n source did not differ per strain.

detectable amounts of nitrite were produced from nitrate, used as sole nitrogen source, in all strains once oxygen concentrations became low. the only exception was m. methanica r- <dig> . when growth and methane oxidation activity ceased due to oxygen limitation, no additional nitrite was produced, but several strains  showed a slow decrease in nitrite levels with a corresponding rise in nitrous oxide over time . this was most clear for m. koyamae r- <dig>  as for this strain from the start of the incubation at high oxygen tension  until day six , methane was oxidized but no nitrite or nitrous oxide could be measured. at day nine, nitrite levels of approximately 400 μm were measured at oxygen levels below  <dig> % v/v, and from that point onwards, until the end of the incubation at day  <dig>  nitrite levels dropped with a corresponding rise in nitrous oxide levels, while no more methane oxidation occurred. m. koyamae r- <dig> produced nitrite but did not produce nitrous oxide . m. methanica ncimb 11130t and r- <dig> and methylosinus sp. r- <dig> produced both nitrite and nitrous oxide, but did not show a subsequent drop in nitrite and corresponding rise in nitrous oxide . m. methanica r- <dig> produced nitrous oxide and small amounts of nitrite, approximating the detection limit of the assay .

with ammonium as sole nitrogen source, m. methanica r- <dig>  m. lenta r- <dig> and r- <dig>  and methylosinus sp. r- <dig>  produced both measurable levels of nitrite and nitrous oxide. interestingly, between day six and nine, a fraction of the produced nitrite seems to be converted into nitrous oxide, after which both nitrite and nitrous oxide levels remained stable over time . most strains were able to produce nitrous oxide without preceding measureable levels of nitrite.

discussion
the ability of methylomonas strains to produce nitrite and nitrous oxide from moderate levels  of nitrate and ammonium, indicative of detoxification, demonstrated metabolic variability on both genus- and species level . ammonium amendments introduce a fraction of ammonia to the culture depending on the ph, which can be oxidized to hydroxylamine by methane monooxygenase. the conversion of hydroxylamine directly to nitric oxide or indirectly via nitrite is well studied and limited to the activity of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase  <cit> , and to a much lesser extent cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, nitrate metabolism is underexplored in methanotrophs and little is known, except that nitrite from nitrate can be produced by both assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reductases  <cit> . nevertheless, high levels of nitrite produced from nitrate should also be converted to nitric oxide for nitrite detoxification. upon production, the cytotoxic nitric oxide needs to be immediately detoxified to the, at least for the cell, harmless nitrous oxide by one of the many known nitric oxide reductase enzymes  <cit> . in the present study, most strains were able to produce nitrous oxide from ammonium without preceding measurable levels of nitrite, either due to an immediate conversion of hydroxylamine to nitric oxide by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase or to small transient nitrite peaks below detection levels. the latter hypothesis is plausible when considering the nearly identical nitrous oxide profiles observed for m. methanica ncimb 11130t and methylosinus sp. r- <dig>  except the nitrite peak , suggesting the same detoxification mechanism. nitrate as sole nitrogen source was converted to nitrite in all strains once oxygen concentrations became low, except for m. methanica r- <dig> that probably lacks an enzyme for nitrate reduction. strains of both m. methanica and m. koyamae showed a drop in nitrite levels with a corresponding rise in nitrous oxide levels . these observations would fit nicely with activities of an oxygen-sensitive nitrate reductase producing nitrite in actively growing cells, which is subsequently detoxified to nitrous oxide  during stationary phase, similar to previous observations for non-denitrifiers  <cit> , but unreported in methanotrophs. m. methanica ncimb 11130t and r- <dig> produced both nitrite and nitrous oxide from nitrate, but did not show a subsequent drop in nitrite and corresponding rise in nitrous oxide . m. koyamae r- <dig> was the only strain not able to produce nitrous oxide from either nitrate or ammonium, probably because it lacks a nitric oxide reductase. on the other hand, m. koyamae strain r- <dig> did produce nitrous oxide from nitrate but not from ammonium. this indicates that the nitrous oxide produced was truly derived directly from nitrate via nitrite, and not via an indirect process via ammonium, i.e. assimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium. it is clear that, although variable phenotypes for nitrite and nitrous oxide production from nitrate and ammonium can be tentatively explained using the currently described genomic inventories of other methanotrophs  <cit>  or a combination thereof, various novel features on specifically nitrate reduction should be the subject of further genome and expression studies.

within a single species, strain-dependent differences were also observed. this was most obvious for strains within m. koyamae regarding their tolerance to high ammonium levels. noteworthy are the identical 16s rrna gene and  identical functional gene sequences between the highly ammonium-tolerant m. koyamae strains ncimb 14606t and r- <dig>  and the low ammonium-tolerant strain r- <dig>  . this differentiation among m. koyamae strains is further demonstrated in their tolerance to hydroxylamine . in addition, r- <dig> unexpectedly did not exhibit n <dig> fixation, as sole m. koyamae strain, despite a >99% nifh gene sequence similarity with strains ncimb 14606t and r- <dig>  both positive for n <dig> fixation under low oxygen tension. this might be explained by a higher oxygen sensitivity of the nitrogenase of this strain  <cit> , requiring oxygen concentrations lower than the 2% used here. in addition, something worth considering as well is the applicability of m. koyamae r- <dig> for methane mitigation in high-ammonium sites, since this strain grows at 100 mm ammonium levels, utilizes 2 mm nitrite as sole nitrogen source, tolerates hydroxylamine levels up to 1 mm and possesses pathways to detoxify ammonia and nitrite.

some features appeared to be general within methylomonas with some strain specific exceptions. the observed higher tolerance to ammonium than nitrate confirmed previous reports of methanotrophic growth inhibition above 40 mm nitrate  <cit> . nevertheless, two m. lenta strains  tolerated nitrate concentrations up to 100 mm. this could not be linked to a possible higher nitrite tolerance, as all strains could grow with up to 2 mm nitrite as sole nitrogen source. this nitrite tolerance and assimilation was in contrast to earlier findings that nitrite utilization was rare for m. methanica members  <cit> . the presence of the nifh gene and the ability to fix nitrogen with an oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase was also found in most strains, although both traits appear to be strain-dependent when combining the results of this study with other reports  <cit> . although initially thought to be limited to mostly type ii and type ib methanotrophs  <cit> , our findings are in agreement with more recent reports suggesting that nitrogen fixation is a common feature of many methanotrophs, including type ia and verrucomicrobial methanotrophs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
microbial ecologists still struggle to link microbial community structure to ecosystem functioning, notwithstanding that in-depth analyses of microbial community structure has never been easier than now, with the affordability of deep sequencing of amplified genes as well as whole communities. but to make sense out of sequence data, basic knowledge about the biology of the microorganisms involved in the biogeochemical functions under study is pivotal. unfortunately, current insights are often retrieved from sporadic pure culture studies including only few distantly related strains. here, investigation of closely related, genotypically different methanotrophic strains revealed differential responses to overcome inhibition and toxicity from high nitrogen loads and assimilation of various nitrogen sources, yielding competitive fitness advantages to individual methane-oxidizing bacteria. we have not assessed the specific effect of nitrogen on methanotrophic activity rate, but rather demonstrated the surprising versatility below the commonly used cut-off for operational taxonomic units, i.e. genus level. our results proved that community structure at the deepest phylogenetic resolution potentially influences in situ functioning. until molecular tools become available to allow much finer analyses of microbial diversity, metabolic variability at those unmeasurable levels should be taken into account.
