BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobe, is a major colonizer of gingival tissues, causing severe forms of adult periodontitis, in which the gingival fibroblast suffers extensive damage  <cit> . as replication inside mammalian cells is a common strategy adopted by many pathogenic bacteria, p. gingivalis infection has served as an important study model. a flurry of recent research has unraveled various pathways of interaction between oral cells and p. gingivalis  <cit> . infection of various cell types by p. gingivalis activated cytokines and chemokines of potential importance in pathology, such as tnf-α, il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the exact roles of which in adult periodontitis remain to be determined  <cit> .

p. gingivalis encodes a number of proteases, collectively known as 'gingipains', which have received considerable attention due to their multiplicity and potent activity  <cit> . the major members of this family include two arg gingipains , and a lys gingipain  that are trypsin-like cysteine proteinases, specific for -arg-xaa- and -lys-xaa- peptide bonds, respectively. the gingipains were shown to regulate p. gingivalis adhesion and invasion positively as well as negatively depending on the cell type  <cit> . in a murine model of periodontitis, all contributed to virulence  <cit> . recently, we and others have characterized a new protease of p. gingivalis, named endopeptidase o , and provided evidence for its importance in invasion and growth in human gum epithelial  and human lung epithelial  cells in culture  <cit> .

a number of intracellular pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and parasites, either cause or suppress apoptosis of the infected mammalian cell by regulating a battery of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes  <cit> . interestingly, various p. gingivalis protease preparations have been demonstrated to promote apoptosis when exogenously added to cells in culture  <cit> . the exact mechanism of this 'extrinsic' apoptosis is unknown but is believed to be triggered by the degradation of cell adhesion molecules such as neural cadherins and integrins by the proteases  <cit> , which also causes detachment of the target cell from the tissue. it has been postulated that in periodontitis, apoptotic signals may overwhelm the normal anti-apoptotic forces that maintain periodontal vessels  <cit> . in contrast, p. gingivalis infection of human gingival epithelial  cells led to an anti-apoptotic response that paralleled the induction of mitochondrial anti-apoptotic bcl- <dig> protein  <cit> . in a recent study externalization of membrane phosphotidylserine  was noted immediately after p. gingivalis infection of hge cells, suggesting an apoptosis-like response  <cit> . however, this was reversible, as the ps was internalized after  <dig> day of infection, and activation of the protein kinase akt resulted in an anti-apoptotic response. clearly, it is important to determine whether different gingival cell types respond differently to p. gingivalis and whether the gingipains play multiple regulatory roles in growth and pathogenesis.

although the fibroblast layer constitutes bulk of the gingival tissue, the molecular details of its interaction with p. gingivalis remain poorly understood. we decided to use primary human gingival fibroblast  cells in our studies for their obvious physiological relevance. in this communication, we analyze the status of programmed cell death or apoptosis in p. gingivalis-infected primary hgf cells and show that apoptosis is regulated in a stage-specific manner through the activation of an array of intracellular anti- and pro-apoptotic signalling molecules.

RESULTS
optimal infection of hgf cells by p. gingivalis requires a high m.o.i
previous studies in which mammalian cells were infected with p. gingivalis in tissue culture typically used high multiplicities of infection  – about 100– <dig> bacteria per human cell. it was not clear why such large number of bacteria were apparently needed for infection. a few studies that addressed the quantitative aspects of infection paid attention to the percentage of infecting bacterial cells but not to the percentage of infected mammalian cells. for example, in one study tests of m.o.i.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed that the highest percentage of bacteria invaded hge cells at  <dig> m.o.i.  <cit> . in another study using kb oral epidermoid carcinoma epithelial cells , only about 2% bacteria attached to the cell monolayer at  <dig> m.o.i. of added p. gingivalis  <cit> . single mutants lacking either protease rgpa or rgpb showed similar efficiency; however, when the rgpa rgpb double mutant was tested, about 60% bacteria attached to the epithelial cells. to explain this unexpected result, it was postulated that the arg-gingipains may play a negative role in cell attachment by digesting the cellular receptors  <cit> . in all these experiments the percentage of infected kb cells remained undetermined. role of kgp was also not tested. as attachment and invasion are the obligatory first steps in infection, we considered it important to determine the optimal efficiency of infection of hgf cells before proceeding to study the subsequent events.

to achieve this, we first quantified the efficiency of invasion. washed wild type and triple gingipain mutant  p. gingivalis  <cit>  were added to hgf monolayers and the infected hgf cells were counted by fluorescence staining with p. gingivalis antibody. a representative set of results  show that there was a modest increase in the percentage of hgf cells infected with increasing m.o.i. invasion reached a plateau at about  <dig> m.o.i., when roughly half of the cells were infected . the triple protease mutant p. gingivalis fared worse, infecting only about a third of all cells at the same m.o.i. although it is possible that some cells were infected at levels below the threshold of visible fluorescence, and therefore, were scored as uninfected, we can conclude that infection of hgf by p. gingivalis is a relatively inefficient process and that the arg- and lys-gingipains are not absolutely essential for invasion but improve the efficiency. based on these findings  and to achieve equal invasion we used an m.o.i. of  <dig> for the triple mutant and  <dig> for the wild type p. gingivalis in all subsequent experiments.

next, to determine the optimal time of release of progeny p. gingivalis from the infected cells, we assayed for bacterial colony forming units  in the hgf growth media at different times post-infection. this was done by plating serial dilutions of the media on agar plates as described in materials and methods. maximal release of progeny bacteria occurred at  <dig> h post-infection coinciding with significant lysis of the monolayer . thus, we carried out all of our signalling experiments at earlier time points, usually not exceeding  <dig> h post-infection.

p. gingivalis causes late apoptosis in infected hgf cells
at various times post-infection p. gingivalis-infected hgf cell monolayers were fixed and multiparametric staining including tunel staining for apoptosis was performed. representative data  show little apoptosis at early time point but significant apoptosis from  <dig> h onwards. apoptosis was confirmed by propidium iodide-annexin v staining . the triple gingipain-mutant p. gingivalis also caused apoptosis but appeared to be slower and less effective.

as tunel is largely qualitative, we extended these studies with more detailed analyses . a quantitative estimate of apoptotic nucleosome release was conducted, which supported the tunel kinetics and revealed that apoptosis by p. gingivalis is indeed a relatively late process in infection and that the mutant is less proficient in this regard . the dna fragmentation paralleled activation of caspase- <dig>  a major executioner caspase, using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate . we then investigated the activation of seven strategic caspases, including caspase- <dig>  by immunoblot detection of their cleaved, active fragments, and the results  showed activation of caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> in addition to caspase- <dig>  but not caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  or - <dig>  activation of caspases was found to occur late in infection, starting at around  <dig> h, coincident to apoptotic dna damage. these results strongly suggested a role of specific caspases in p. gingivalis-induced apoptosis of hgf cells.

for a direct measure of the intracellular caspase activity, we attempted to detect the breakdown products of αii-spectrin . in apoptotic cells, the  <dig> kda αii-spectrin undergoes a series of caspase-mediated cleavage to generate a major  <dig> kda fragment, although a  <dig> kda intermediate is sometimes detected as well  <cit> . immunoblot analysis of p. gingivalis-infected hgf cell lysate  revealed the  <dig> kda product, but only at late stages of infection, between  <dig> h and  <dig> h. the wild type p. gingivalis and the triple protease mutant produced essentially identical breakdown products that appeared much later in mutant-infected cells . these results supported a caspase-induced breakdown of αii-spectrin and also matched the late-stage apoptosis and the slower kinetics of apoptosis by the mutant.

p. gingivalis protease directly cleave and activate procaspase- <dig> in vitro
although the full impact of gingipains in host-bacterial interaction is still under investigation, their role in invasion is well-documented. as mentioned, exogenously added gingipains trigger extrinsic cell death, at least one mechanism of which involves the cleavage of external cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins and integrins  <cit> . whether they have a role in the intrinsic pathways of apoptosis remains unknown. although activated caspases are hallmark effectors of apoptosis, recent evidence suggests that non-caspase proteases such as cathepsins, calpains, granzymes, and the proteasome complex may have a direct caspase-like role in mediating apoptosis, but perhaps only in specific cell types or under specific signals  <cit> . because p. gingivalis is a known producer of highly active proteases in the infected cells, it was worth testing whether these proteases might directly process and thereby activate an executioner caspase. to this end, we incubated purified recombinant procaspase- <dig> with p. gingivalis culture supernatant, and tested for cleavage. results  show that the  <dig> kda procaspase- <dig> was indeed cleaved to characteristic  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda fragments. the product sizes roughly matched with those produced by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of procaspase- <dig>  enzymatic activity of caspase- <dig> was confirmed by using the specific substrate peptide, devd . similar amounts of culture supernatant made from the triple gingipain mutant exhibited little processing activity. finally, the processing activity was destroyed by heat, in agreement with its protease nature. these results raise the interesting possibility that the arg- and lys-gingipains have the potential to directly contribute to apoptosis by activating intracellular caspase- <dig> 

p. gingivalis infection of hgf cells leads to early activation of nf-kappa b
the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-kappa b  is generally responsible for suppression of apoptosis, although there are exceptions where it promotes apoptosis or has no apparent role in apoptosis  <cit> . in a number of obligatory parasites, infected cells are protected from apoptotic signals, mainly as a result of activation of nf-κb. in light of the apparent lag in apoptosis in the early stages of p. gingivalis infection it was important to determine whether nf-κb is activated in these cells. for a preliminary test, we first used an engineered hek <dig>  cell line that contained a chromosomal reporter luciferase gene under the control of nf-κb enhancers. because of the convenience of luciferase assay, these cells are commonly used for rapid initial screening of nf-κb activating agents before detailed studies are done in more relevant cells. for example, we have shown previously that infection of these cells with respiratory syncytial virus leads to activation of nf-κb and hence, luciferase activity  <cit> . conversely, inhibitors of nf-κb reduced the luciferase activity back to basal levels. as shown , a surge of luciferase activity was also detected at around  <dig> h following p. gingivalis infection of hek <dig> cells. the levels gradually subsided from  <dig> h onward, suggesting loss of nf-κb activity. the gingipain-deficient strain also activated nf-κb albeit substantially weakly. sn <dig>  a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of nf-κb  <cit> , strongly reduced luciferase activity, demonstrating specificity.

having obtained positive results in luciferase assay, we proceeded to the physiologically relevant hgf cells and investigated nf-κb activation by direct measurement of the nuclear levels of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb. in unstimulated cells, p <dig> is held back in the cytoplasm in complex with the inhibitors of κb, such as iκbα. various signals including infection by many pathogens lead to the phosphorylation of iκbα via iκb kinase , followed by degradation of phospho-iκbα, allowing the nuclear import of p <dig> via its nuclear localization signal, where it activates transcription of nf-κb-dependent genes  <cit> . thus, the appearance of nf-κb in the cell nucleus is indicative of its activation. it is seen  that p. gingivalis infection of hgf cells led to nuclear translocation of p <dig> early in infection that started to decline around  <dig> h. phosphorylation of iκb was also detectable as early as  <dig> h p.i. , suggesting a correlation. a common upstream pathway leading to activation of nf-κb in many cells involves phosphoinositol- <dig> kinase, pi3k, and curiously, an inhibitor of pi3k  inhibited iκb phosphorylation in these cells . this led us to study the potential role of pi3k in p. gingivalis-mediated activation of the nf-κb signalling, described next.

p. gingivalis infection activates the pi3k-akt pathway
in mammalian cells, the pi3k/akt pathway generally acts in a pro-survival, anti-apoptotic role  <cit> . a multitude of external stimuli activate intracellular pi3k that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate into the  <dig> ,5-triphosphate. the latter activates protein kinase pdk, which then phosphorylates akt , thereby activating akt. the activated akt phosphorylates a large number of substrates such as forkhead transcription factor , ikk, bad, caspase- <dig>  and gsk- <dig>  together, these events inactivate the pro-apoptotic players such as bad, and activate anti-apoptotic players such as nf-κb, leading to a net suppression of apoptosis.

we, therefore, determined the phosphorylation status of these signalling molecules in hgf cells during p. gingivalis growth using phosphospecific antibodies, and the results are presented in fig.  <dig>  it can be seen that all the major players of the pathway, namely pdk, akt, forkhead and gsk- <dig> were phosphorylated at comparable kinetics, early in infection. total akt protein levels did not change, confirming that the effect was truly on the phosphorylation status and not on protein synthesis. these anti-apoptotic phosphorylations occurred relatively early  and appeared to reach maximal levels by  <dig> h. in fact, at later times  phosphorylations reverted back to near pre-induction levels. the gingipain-deficient mutant also activated the same pathways with a similar kinetics. in all cases, the pi3k inhibitor, ly <dig>  abolished the phosphorylation, demonstrating that pi3k is indeed the most upstream kinase in this p. gingivalis-activated pathway. the same inhibitor also strongly inhibited the activation of nf-κb by p. gingivalis , further supporting a role of pi3k in survival. together, these results strongly support our premise that the early cellular response in p. gingivalis-infected hgf is anti-apoptotic whereas the late response is pro-apoptotic.

temporal transcriptional induction of anti- and pro-apoptotic family genes by p. gingivalis
studies over the last two decades have enlisted a large family of cellular genes that take part in either preventing or promoting apoptosis  <cit> . as the decision between cellular life and death is a net resultant of these two opposing forces, we decided to obtain a comprehensive view of expression of both families in p. gingivalis-infected hgf cells. the steady-state mrna levels of major members of the two families were determined by reverse transcription and quantitative real-time pcr, and the results are presented in fig.  <dig> as fold-induction over uninfected levels. the top two rows represent anti-apoptotic genes, and the rest are pro-apoptotic. the general trend that emerged from these results is that the two families were induced differently. the anti-apoptotic genes were induced early in infection, generally reaching their maximal levels by  <dig> h and then diminishing to variable extents over the rest of the infection period. the induction of a number of anti-apoptotic genes was sharply inhibited by the pi3k inhibitor, ly <dig>  as well as by the nf-κb inhibitor, sn <dig>  further correlating the anti-apoptotic gene profile with the survival pathway. a representative example is bfl <dig>  the most robustly activated anti-apoptotic gene ; both inhibitors caused 60–70% reduction of its induction. similar inhibitory effect was also seen for three other genes tested, namely, boo, bcl- <dig>  survivin .

in sharp contrast, the vast majority of the pro-apoptotic genes reached their maximum expression in later periods of infection, peaking between  <dig> and  <dig> h. most were expressed poorly or not at all until about  <dig> h p.i. as in other pathways, the gingipain-deficient mutant activated these genes with similar overall kinetics. for the majority of the genes the mutant was weaker than the wild type although there were a few exceptions, such as the expression of bcl-w, bik, bax, moap- <dig> was comparable in wild type and mutant-infected cells, and the induction of bfl- <dig> and bcl-xl expression was somewhat stronger in mutant-infected cells . we carried out immunoblot  analysis of selected representative proteins, namely bcl-xl, survivin, bax and bad, and the results essentially paralleled those of the transcript levels . in conclusion, the general trend was that the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic genes was turned on early and late in infection, respectively, in a mutually exclusive chronological order.

discussion
one major finding in our study is the inefficient invasion by p. gingivalis, at least in cell culture, explaining the high m.o.i. traditionally used by all investigators. although the exact mechanism needs further research, bacterial fimbriae, which are proteinaceous appendages extending from the bacterial cell surface, are known to play specific and important roles in bacterial adhesion and invasion, likely through an interaction with integrin and fibronectin of the host cell  <cit> . it is possible that these interactions are relatively inefficient and slow. our results support the previous demonstration that arg-gingipains enhance fimbriae-fibronectin binding, leading to the suggestion that the functional epitopes of cellular receptors of p. gingivalis are cryptic and that the arg-gingipains expose them  <cit> . this is also consistent with our finding that the protease-deficient mutant p. gingivalis is a generally poor invader .

the second major finding here is that infection of primary gingival fibroblast cells by p. gingivalis, an important gum pathogen, leads to apoptosis, which may in part underlie the extensive tissue damage seen in gingivitis. interestingly, early in infection, cellular anti-apoptotic genes are induced and postpone apoptosis; at later times, they give way to pro-apoptotic genes, and apoptosis ensues. as apoptosis is an exceedingly complex process involving a large variety of signalling molecules, we have focused our attention to selective major players.

the anti-apoptotic early phase in p. gingivalis-infected hgf cells is characterized by the activation of pi3k/akt pathway. our results  strongly suggest that this pathway is largely responsible for the activation of pro-survival transcription factor nf-κb. the anti-apoptotic function most likely facilitates p. gingivalis growth by thwarting premature dismantling of the host cell. the response of hgf and hge cells to p. gingivalis infection, therefore, has interesting similarities and differences. like hgf cells, infection of hge cells resulted in suppression of apoptosis, which required phosphorylation-mediated activation of akt and was inhibited by ly <dig>  <cit> . however, hgf cells eventually became apoptotic whereas hge cells appeared to remain anti-apoptotic. thus, the fibroblasts and epithelial cells of the same tissue may differently regulate the apoptotic modulators, the mechanism of which must await further study.

caspases are a class of cysteine proteases that includes several representatives involved in apoptosis  <cit> . they are activated via a proteolytic cascade, cleaving and activating other caspases, eventually degrading downstream targets and promoting cell death . the main "initiator" caspases at the upper end of the cascade are caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  caspase- <dig> is activated in response to death receptors  whereas caspase- <dig> is activated by the release of cytochrome c via the intrinsic mitochondrial stress pathway. activation of caspase- <dig> but not caspase- <dig> in p. gingivalis-infected hgf cells  strongly points to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway. clearly, caspase- <dig> then activates the downstream "executioner" caspases, namely caspase- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  spectrin fragments serve to distinguish between caspase- <dig> and calpain; while caspase- <dig> cleavage generates the  <dig> kda fragment calpain produces  <dig> and  <dig> kda fragments  <cit> . our results, therefore, confirms caspase- <dig> activation  and rules out a role of calpain in p. gingivalis-mediated apoptosis. a novel apoptotic pathway has been discovered recently, in which an endoplasmic reticulum  resident caspase, namely caspase- <dig>  is activated by er stress that may be triggered by heavy traffic of glycoproteins through the er. for example, we have shown that infection by respiratory syncytial virus, a cytoplasmic rna virus expressing three glycoproteins that traffic through the er, causes late apoptosis in lung epithelial cells by activating er-stress and caspase- <dig>  <cit> . together, results presented here suggest that p. gingivalis activates apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and not the er or fas pathway.

based on these findings, we present a working hypothesis of p. gingivalis-activated apoptosis in hgf cells in fig.  <dig>  we emphasize that it is not a comprehensive list and that we have provided experimental evidence only for the key players in each major branch. in the anti-apoptotic early phase, we have demonstrated activation of pdk, akt / pkb, the akt substrates  and the ikk substrate  . the involvement of pi3k and nf-κb was also uncovered by the use of specific inhibitors. transcriptional activation of a battery of anti-apoptotic genes is also indicated , which was abrogated by inhibitors of either pi3k or nf-κb. the pro-survival role of the pi3k/nf-κb pathway is explained by the recent demonstrations that transcription of these anti-apoptotic genes is nf-κb-dependent  <cit> .

in the pro-apoptotic late phase of infection, we surmise a major role for the mitochondria. one of the best characterized mechanisms used by mitochondria to induce cell death is the release of pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytosol  <cit> . cytochrome c, the first molecule shown to be released, complexes with apoptosis protease-activating factor  <dig>  and exposes domains of apaf- <dig> that activate caspase- <dig>  a proteolytic cascade ensues that eventually activates caspases- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> , and our results show activation of all these caspases . nucleosomal dna degradation  suggested the activation of dna-fragmentation factor , although the involvement of aif and endonuclease g, released from stressed mitochondria  cannot be ruled out. most importantly, the kinetics of activation of these proteins was in accord with the shift from an anti- to a pro-apoptotic response.

further evidence for the shift came from transcriptional data of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes. the mitochondrial bcl- <dig> family  <cit>  comprises of both kinds, such as the anti-apoptotic members bcl- <dig>  bcl-xl, bcl-w, mcl- <dig> and the pro-apoptotic members bax, bak, bok, bid, bad, puma, bmf, bim, bok, noxa and hrk/dp <dig>  some of the most highly activated genes in fig.  <dig> indeed belong to these two families and their functions match with the temporal shift from survival to death. however, the relative contribution of each of these proteins in regulating apoptosis is currently unknown.

the direct processing of procaspase- <dig> by p. gingivalis protease  adds a novel dimension to 'intrinsic' apoptosis by bacteria. interestingly, structural analysis of the catalytic subunit of rgp revealed a caspase-like fold, suggesting a common ancestor  <cit> . moreover, homology mapping suggested that a single protease clan, named cd  <cit>  or the caspase-hemoglobinase fold  <cit> , encompasses gingipains and caspases as well as bacterial clostripain and legumains   <cit> . as the processing by gingipains generated enzymatically active caspase- <dig> , it is reasonable to conjecture that the cleavage occurred at or close to the natural processing site. the processing defect of the rgpa rgpb kgp mutant suggests that the cleaved peptide bond would be next to either an arg or a lys. the natural processing in procasapse- <dig> is known to occur next to the asp <dig>  shown here in bold within the substrate motif ietd: cr164gteldcgietd175sgvdddmachk <dig>  we noticed arg <dig> and lys <dig> nearby ,  <dig> residues upstream and downstream of the asp <dig>  respectively. we speculate that one or more of the gingipains cleave the procasapse- <dig> at either or both of these sites to produce the activated caspase- <dig>  this is currently being tested. the physiological significance of this activation also needs to be resolved. it is possible that the anti-apoptotic functions antagonize this activation and prevents it from happening too early in infection. moreover, note that the mutant strain is not completely defective in activating apoptosis and caspase- <dig> in hgf cells . thus, the three gingipains, although not absolutely essential, seem to be needed for optimal apoptotic response.

we note here that the gingipains may be partially sequestered by serum proteins; human  <cit>  and bovine  serum albumin, for example, are excellent substrates for gingipains. it is also possible that serum will contain unidentified inhibitors of gingipains  <cit> . on the other hand, the presence of serum likely approximates the physiological infection of the gum and provides an optimal nutrient level for intracellular replication of the bacteria. for the best compromise, therefore, we allowed the bacteria to invade initially for  <dig> min in the absence of serum, and then replaced it with serum-supplemented medium for further growth .

it is tempting to speculate that the delayed apoptosis of the host cell most likely allows p. gingivalis extra time to replicate intracellularly to a higher yield and at the same time offers early protection to the infected cells against cytotoxic mediators of the host immune system. an extended period of nuclear dna integrity may also allow the cell to transcriptionally activate genes that modulate immune or inflammatory response. apoptosis then occurs at the late stage of infection when the replicated bacteria must destroy the host cell anyway in order to egress and infect neighboring cells for fresh nutrients and continued growth. clearly, a detailed knowledge of how p. gingivalis regulates the balance between multiple apoptotic signalling molecules in chronological order will shed important light on the mechanism of tissue damage in gingivitis and may provide a pharmacological regimen to control the infection.

CONCLUSIONS
p. gingivalis infection of human gingival epithelial cells initially triggers a survival response through the activation of pi3k/akt pathway, resulting in the activation of nf-κb and a family of anti-apoptotic proteins. this likely allows optimal growth of the bacteria. at later stages of infection the anti-apoptotic proteins subside and pro-apoptotic ones are turned on, leading to apoptosis of the infected cell. bacterial proteases of the gingipain family play important roles in various aspects of infection, including proteolytic activation of caspases by processing, which may directly contribute to the observed apoptosis. thus, p. gingivalis and the host gingival cell interact via a variety of pathways that are relevant in the pathology and degradation of the gingiva.

culture of hgf cells
primary cultures of hgf cells were made from biopsies of healthy human gingival obtained from dental clinics. the tissues were washed several times in pbs and dmem, then cut into small pieces and placed in a t- <dig> cm <dig> flask with complete medium containing dmem supplemented with 10% fbs,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig>  μg/ml fungizone, and  <dig> u/ml penicillin/ streptomycin. when ready for passage, the fibroblast cells were cultured as monolayers in the same complete media without fungizone at 37°c in a standard 5% co <dig> incubator.

infection of hgf cells with p. gingivalis
hgf cells were used at  <dig> to 90% confluency for all experiments. before infecting with p. gingivalis, the monolayers were washed three times with pbs. p. gingivalis, resuspended in dmem without fbs or antibiotics, was added to the hgf monolayer at the desired m.o.i. and incubated for  <dig> min at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  the monolayer was then washed twice with pbs to remove unbound bacteria, dmem supplemented 10% fbs and  <dig> mm l-glutamine was added, and growth continued at 37°c in 5% co <dig> 

assessment of bacterial invasion was done by an antibiotic protection assay essentially as described previously with minor changes  <cit> . hgf cells were first infected with washed p. gingivalis and external, nonadherent bacteria were removed as described above. the cultures were then incubated for an additional  <dig> h at 37°c in fresh medium containing  <dig> μg gentamicin and  <dig> μg of metronidazole per ml to kill the remaining extracellular bacteria  <cit> . we confirmed that the antibiotics did not affect the morphology of the hgf cells or alter their ability to exclude trypan blue. following invasion, the hgf cells were fixed and stained as described below.

immunofluorescence studies and assays of cell death and nf-κb
for multiparametric staining, hgf cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates to 80–90% confluency. the cells were then infected with washed p. gingivalis as above. coverslips were washed three times with pbs and fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid for  <dig> min on ice. successive washes were then performed with 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol, and finally with pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  the coverslips were incubated with a rabbit antibody against p. gingivalis fim a and then with secondary mouse antibody . finally, the coverslips are mounted on a slide with dapi-dabco solution and observed by fluorescence microscopy in an olympus bmax epifluorescence microscope  <cit>

caspase cleavage and assay
overnight grown p. gingivalis cells were collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g and washed three times with pbs. pellets were resuspended in dmem  and incubated for  <dig> h anaerobically  at 37°c. supernatant was collected by centrifugation  and protein concentration determined by bradford assay .

to test for the cleavage activity, pre-determined amounts of the supernatant were incubated with  <dig> μg of purified procasapase- <dig>  at 37°c in a  <dig> μl reaction in the following buffer:  <dig> mm hepes ,  <dig> mm nacl, 20% glycerol,  <dig> % chaps,  <dig> mm dtt. the supernatant was substituted with purified caspase- <dig>  in a positive control reaction and with same volume of buffer in a negative control. portions of the reaction were analyzed by sds-page and immunoblot  <cit> . the rest of the reaction was assayed for caspase- <dig> activity using the colorimetric substrate, devd-pna, which upon cleavage exhibits increased absorption at  <dig> nm . reactions were incubated at 30°c and followed with time in a spectrophotometer to ensure linearity.
