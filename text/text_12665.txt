BACKGROUND
enzyme catalyzes a wide variety of chemical reactions with great efficiency and specificity  <cit> . applications of enzymes in industrial catalysis continue to grow because of their considerable advantages  <cit> . although the classical approach of cultivating and characterizing isolates on the strain level prior to gene isolation is valid and powerful, it is severely restricted in scope  <cit> . so capturing the genes of organisms that have evolved as participants in biotopes promises to revolutionize and broaden enzyme applications in the chemical industry  <cit> . by the analysis of relationships among sequence, structure and activity  <cit> , the function of newly obtained biocatalysts can be identified. however, broadening enzyme substrate specificity  <cit>  is still a tough task most of the time.

on the other hand, computer-aided drug design   <cit> , especially different new protein inhibitors design  <cit> , has been developed rapidly. many theories and methodologies have been brought forward in this field  <cit> . more and more new drugs have been designed  <cit>  by in silico methods. in view of the similar molecular recognition nature between ligand-target protein system and enzyme-substrate system  <cit> , molecular docking  <cit>  which was used in cadd to find the binding pattern between ligand and target protein was applied to broaden enzyme mapping of substrates in this study.

although molecular docking is efficient in predicting energetically favourable poses of ligand  <cit> , it may be inappropriate for explaining the substrate-enzyme reactions sometimes. because in some situations, substrates may adopt energetically unfavourable poses which can not be accounted by molecular docking to facilitate the catalytic reactions that are mediated by enzymes  <cit> . it is especially true when the catalysis step is the actual rate-determining step. so we employed a third screening criterion in our designed screening system to address the problem . although the most accurate way of studying substrate-enzyme reactions is the quantum chemical  level computation  <cit> , its application in biomacromolecules is too costly to be achieved at present. so molecular docking, a rough but much less costly computational tool, was used to simulate the substrate binding step of the enzyme reaction process. although the structure-based cass system developed in the present study seemed simple and coarse, its screening accuracy was unexpectedly high.  <dig> out of  <dig> tested compounds were identified correctly for the enzyme by cass. this suggests that biotechnologists can use the same computational means to reduce their mount of experimental work.

RESULTS
measurements of all binding conformations for each compound were listed in the table s <dig> of additional file  <dig>  then lowest energy conformations  were picked out for the checking system . as figure  <dig> showed,  <dig> out of  <dig> compounds were rejected by "conformational check". the rest  <dig> compounds were subject to the second screening criterion – "distance  <dig> check". only  <dig> compounds were accepted. finally, the  <dig> rejected compounds were screened by the third screening standard – "distance  <dig> check". through this step, another group of  <dig> compounds was accepted. altogether,  <dig> of the  <dig> compounds were accepted as potential substrates of calb. the remnant  <dig> compounds were considered not to be catalyzed by the enzyme.

generally speaking, experimental work should be carried out to inspect the accuracy of the in silico screening result. however, all the  <dig> compounds used in the present study had been fortunately reported by references . by comparing the virtual screening results with the reported experimental observations, we found an unexpected but inspiring result: all  <dig> compounds accepted by cass system were confirmed to be catalyzed by the enzyme;  <dig> out of the  <dig> rejected compounds were verified as inappropriate substrate of the enzyme; in all,  <dig> out of the  <dig> tested compounds were identified correctly by the in silico screening system. such high accuracy of the method  guaranteed not only the feasibility but also the availability of the cass system.

there were still  <dig> compounds which were predicted mistakenly by the cass system. the error would probably come from molecular docking, because substrates may adopt energetically unfavourable poses which can not be accounted by molecular docking to facilitate the catalytic reactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the idea of computer-aided enzyme substrate screening  was introduced, designed and applied successfully to calb.  <dig> out of  <dig> compounds were identified correctly by this in silico screening system. such high accuracy of the method guaranteed both the feasibility and the reliability of the cass system. although the idea of structure-based computer-aided substrate screening sounds wonderful, its application seems more difficult than lead screening in cadd because of three main operational difficulties:  how to determine the 3-d structure of enzyme;  how to define the screening criteria to ensure availability and accuracy;  how to apply the screening criteria to computer software. in this light, there is still a long way to go. however, conformational and geometrical checks which were used in this study suggest clues. our further work will revolve around the application of the cass system to a lipase which was discovered by our own group recently  <cit> . we hope to broaden the substrate mapping of it with less experimental work, meanwhile we would also check again the method designed in this study.
