BACKGROUND
mirnas are ~ <dig> nt-long, single stranded rna molecules that mediate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by directing the rna-induced silencing complex  to the 3' untranslated region  of target mrnas  <cit> . as a result, translation is inhibited and/or the mrna degraded  <cit> . the target spectrum of a mirna is mostly defined by the seed, i.e. the 1st or 2nd  <dig> nt, which hybridizes to the target mrna  <cit> . mirnas can both act as developmental switches  <cit>  or subtly tune expression, when tight regulation of a gene is required  <cit> . thousands of mrnas are expected to be under regulatory control of mirnas  <cit>  and the presence or absence of a single mirna has been shown to affect, albeit modestly, the level of thousands of proteins  <cit> . thus, mirnas form a complex regulatory network affecting the majority of genes.

a second developmentally vital class of small rnas are the piwi-interacting rnas  <cit> , which play a role in the formation of the germ line. in mammals, these ~ <dig> nt ssrnas are expressed in the reproductive organs, mainly the testis  <cit> , where two types can be distinguished. the pre-pachytene pirnas, which are repeat- and transposon-derived, likely play a role in guiding dna methylation to repeats, thereby silencing transposons  <cit>  and preventing genome instability. conversely, the pachytene pirnas are mostly derived from a selected set of genomic clusters that show a very strong strand bias. the function of these genomic clusters, however, remains elusive  <cit> .

to a certain extent, development and homeostasis of organ systems depend on mirnas  <cit>  and pirnas  <cit> . the laboratory rat  is a model organism in which organ-systems physiology has been studied for decades  <cit> . recent advances in techniques to genetically modify the rat  <cit>  enables detailed analyses of rat physiology at molecular levels. furthermore, well-established genetic systems, such as congenic, consomic and recombinant inbred lines are versatile tools for studying the effect of genetic variation on quantitative traits such as blood pressure  <cit>  or gene expression  <cit>   and expression qtls, respectively). comprehensive small rna inventories and profiles are instrumental in such genetical genomics and systems biological approaches, as they serve as a resource for annotation of the genome. small rnas are important players in many regulatory processes and are thus important for understanding disease etiology. the rat small rna inventory described here will also be important for understanding human disease, since many rat models were selected to reflect clinical symptoms  <cit> .

conserved expression specificity of mirnas has been described for a number of organ systems or cell cultures, based on  sequencing approaches  <cit> . simultaneously, species-specific mirnas have been identified in closely related species  <cit> , indicating that mirnas are evolutionary dynamic. the availability of comprehensive species-specific mirna profiles of different tissues and organ systems is an important requirement for elucidating the biological roles that mirnas fulfill. more exhaustive profiling will likely improve existing profiles and increase insight in the basis of quantitative and qualitative variations in mirna expression. we therefore performed digital gene expression  profiling of small rnas from six tissues, i.e. brain, liver, spleen, heart, testis and kidney of the bn-lx and shr rat inbred strains, the founder strains of the bxh/hxb recombinant inbred panel  <cit> . we identified  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> new rat mirnas, originating from  <dig> and  <dig> precursor  mirna loci, respectively. thirty-one of these pre-mirnas were not previously characterized in rat, but were found to be homologous to mouse or human loci;  <dig> novel candidate pre-mirna loci do not have an apparent homologue in these species. by generating dge profiles for liver from three individuals from each strain, we observed strain-specific differential mirna expression for  <dig> mirnas. finally, we identified thousands of pirnas in the testis samples. the dataset described here greatly contributes to our understanding of mirna divergence, variation and expression and may be a valuable resource in evolutionary analyses as well as in the interpretation of regulatory networks and functional genomics experiments in the rat.

RESULTS
mirna identification
we collected the small rna fraction and prepared small rna sequencing libraries from  <dig> different tissues  from two rat inbred strains  and spontaneous hypertensive rats , adult males). the libraries were sequenced on the solid platform version  <dig> , generating  <dig> million small rna sequence reads. of all raw reads,  <dig>  million could be mapped to the rat genome . the length distribution of the vast majority of small rna reads was between  <dig> and  <dig> nt, corresponding with the expected size for mirnas. exceptions to this observation were testis small rnas, which are generally longer . in all tissues except testis, the majority of the reads mapped to known mirnas  <cit> ; small rnas from testis were mostly derived from repeats or small rna classes other than mirnas most likely corresponding to pachytene pirnas  <cit>  . we aimed to address global profiling as well as rna editing and for profiling we only included perfectly mapping reads . each tissue dataset consisted out of approximately  <dig>  mirna reads.

we identified  <dig> mirnas, derived from  <dig> of the known mirna loci ,  <dig> mirna loci that were homologous to known mirbase mirnas from either mouse or human and  <dig> confident novel pre-mirna loci . we assume that our global expression profiles allowed us to detect most mirnas. only eleven mirbase mirnas , i.e. rno-mir-7b,  <dig>  291a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were not detected. this is likely due to the absence of the mirna in the investigated tissues, or highly specific expression in a limited number of cells. eight of the novel mirnas reside in close proximity  to known mirnas in the rat. we obtained reads from both the 5' and 3' arm for  <dig> % of the pre-mirnas. although the arm with the lowest read frequency is likely to represent the mirna* sequence, it is also clear that the read frequency of small rnas is subject to capture bias  <cit>  and read frequencies per arm may be misleading. therefore, we treated mirnas derived from either hairpin arm as individual entities for further analysis steps. seed  overlaps with known mirbase mirnas showed that the majority of mirnas is conserved;  <dig> are conserved in rodents, whereas comparison to all categorized vertebrates shows that  <dig> seeds are conserved. likely, the higher number of seed conservation in all vertebrates is due to the poor mirna annotation in most rodents. seventy-seven mirnas  contain seeds without known homologues in vertebrates, of which twenty-four are derived from the opposite strand of known mirnas. these may represent rat-specific mirnas, although it cannot be excluded that these remain to be detected in other species.

tissue-specific mirna profiles
mirnas may act redundantly  <cit>  or in concert  <cit> . in order to understand the function of mirnas in specific tissues, it may therefore be helpful to identify global mirna profiles. to be able to compare mirna profiles, we normalized the mirna reads per tissue and determined the relative expression of mirnas among the six tissues. comparisons between strains showed highly similar expression profiles, with the spearman's ρ ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the ρ among different tissue profiles was considerably lower, as expected  <cit> , ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>   . we determined the number of reads that covered individual known mirnas  and observed that 38% of the known mirnas are ubiquitously expressed among all tissues that were assayed, whereas only 14% of the homologous and 2% of the novel mirnas were identified in all examined tissues.

to systematically detect mirnas that are differentially expressed between tissues, we applied a strict  expression level difference that had to apply for each of the two strains. by applying this conservative cut-off we excluded subtle expression differences and expected to only include mirnas that exert tissue specific regulatory roles. by demanding that this threshold is met in both strains, it is guaranteed that these differences are not specific for a specific genetic background. at this threshold, we identified a set of  <dig> tissue-specific mirnas. the number of tissue-specific mirnas varies considerably between tissues, ranging from  <dig> in liver to  <dig> in brain . notably, we find  <dig> tissue-specific mirnas in testis, the tissue from which we obtained least mirna reads. this excludes coverage as a confounding factor in this analysis. by applying a 5-fold lower expression threshold in a specific tissue, we identified mirnas that specifically lower expressed  in a given tissue. five mirnas are specifically depleted in brain, liver or heart . these mirnas are medium to highly expressed in all other tissues analyzed .

some of these tissue-specific expression patterns are evolutionary conserved, for instance, the testis-specific mir- <dig> was previously reported to be testis-specific in chicken as well  <cit> . other specifically expressed mirnas that we verified are mir- <dig>  which is known to be restricted to the heart  <cit>  and mir- <dig>  the most prominent mirna in liver  <cit> . brain, the most complex tissue in our dataset, also contains most tissue-specific and avoidant mirnas. eighteen mirnas that have no known homologs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, of which  <dig> are present in testis ,  <dig> in liver,  <dig> in spleen and  <dig> in brain. the enrichment for both testis and brain-specific mirnas in this dataset partially excludes lack of sequencing depth as a confounding factor. these results suggest that the emergence of expression of novel mirnas occurs in a tissue-specific fashion. furthermore, these novel tissue-specific mirnas are found primarily in the brain, confirming earlier observations that mirnas might play an important role in the evolutionary plasticity of the brain  <cit> .

tissue-specific rna editing
an auxiliary pathway to regulate mirna expression and targeting is via the deamination of adenosines into inosines, a process known as rna editing  <cit> . this process is mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on rna   <cit> . during sequencing, inosines are read as guanines. to identify rna editing we specifically identified a to g changes in otherwise perfectly mapped mirna sequences and selected those mirnas that are edited in at least 10% of the reads. after this selection we found that six mirnas were subject to editing, including five positions in the mirna seed region . the most abundantly edited mirna is mir-376b, in the brain , fitting with the observation that in murine and human brains, mir-376a/b/c are targets of the rna editing machinery  <cit> . we find the mir-376a/c isoforms to be edited as well, albeit to a lesser extent . importantly, in the case of mir-376a-5p, mir-376b-5p, mir-376a-3p and mir-376-3p the edited nucleoside resides in the seed region, which is instrumental in targeting the mirna to its target and could therefore lead to an altered target spectrum.

in addition to known editing targets, such as mir-376b, we also identified the brain-specific mir- <dig> that was hitherto unknown to be edited. to quantify the degree of editing we verified editing of mir- <dig> by qrt-pcr analysis . based on dilution series we confirmed that the level of editing was ~37%, which is comparable to the level of editing as determined by dge profiling.

strain specificity in the liver
the two strains from which we prepared small rna libraries are the founder strains of the bxh/hxb recombinant inbred panel  <cit> . this is a well-established panel of rat strain that has been used for defining expression quantitative trait loci . as an initial indexation, we determined the liver mirnas that are differentially expressed between the two strains. to estimate the biological variation between individuals, we performed dge profiling on liver samples of three bn-lx and three shr rats. by estimating the variance in similarly expressed mirnas within one strain  we found four mirnas that were differentially expressed between strains  in the liver, i.e. two increased in bn-lx and two increased in shr liver . the two mirnas that were more prominent in bn-lx, mir-742-3p and rno-mir-741-3p, reside in the same genomic cluster and may thus originate from the same primary transcript. we found that the mir-293-5p homologue, which was not previously identified in the rat, was upregulated in shr livers. finally, we found that mir-34a-5', which is known to be a transcriptional target of the pro-apoptotic p <dig> protein  <cit> , was robustly increased in the shr liver. we confirmed the differential expression of this mirna by qrt-pcr . the observed Δct of ~ <dig>  approximates the observed difference in our sequencing datasets .

expression of rno-mir-741-3p and mir-742-3p, which reside in the mir- <dig> genomic cluster and is thus likely to be expressed as a single transcript  <cit> , is strain-specific. this suggests that mirna-specific post-transcriptional regulation could strongly affect mirna expression. in order to investigate the conservation of this cluster, we aligned its pre-mirnas to the genome of the mouse. the mouse is the best annotated close relative of the rat and shares common ancestry with the rat 12- <dig> mya  <cit> . we find that the mir- <dig> cluster is located in a syntentic region on chromosome x and is most prominently, but not uniquely, expressed in testis in both mouse and rat, indicating conservation of location and expression   <cit> . rno-mir- <dig> is partially conserved; the syntenic mouse mirna is mmu-mir- <dig>  notably the strongest diverged arm of rno-mir-741is the most abundant arm in our cloning data  and is the only mirna arm that is described in mmu-mir- <dig>  suggesting that expression is conserved while the sequence has diverged.

while most mirna seeds on this cluster are strongly conserved between rat and mouse, divergence is an ongoing process that occasionally introduces novel functional mirnas. strain-specific processing of such mirnas potentially precedes divergence: if by such regulation the mirna expression is low, the mirna itself can diverge without serious consequences. this may be one mechanism by which mirnas evolve within this mir- <dig> cluster, in which the rno-mir-741/mmu-mir- <dig> ancestral mirna has diverged between mouse and rat.

pirnas
the majority of small rnas in the testis that we identified in our experiments were either repeat-derived or lacked annotation. most likely these small rna reads represent germline-specific piwi-assiociated rnas . because pirnas function in genome maintenance by silencing of transposon sequences  <cit> , we first investigated the pirnas that mapped to annotated repeats like long tandem repeats an other transposon-derived repeats. repeat-derived pirnas are thought to be generated via a "ping-pong" mechanism  <cit> : a pirna hybridizes to a target, which is subsequently cleaved along position  <dig> of the pirna. by further processing, a novel pirna is generated from the original target. in vertebrates, the maturation of pirnas does not depend on dicer, but on piwi homologues  <cit> . they archetypically start with a 5' uracil and posess an adenine on position  <dig>  which suggest that they are argonaute-dependent cleavage products  <cit> . as a result, one of the characteristics of the model is a  <dig> nt 5' region that is complementary between two pirnas. we therefore tested for the presence of this characteristic signature, by selecting all pirnas that mapped to a specific type of transposon  and looked for presence and length of overlap which, as expected, peaks at  <dig> nt . consistent with this overlap, we find the characteristic nucleotide distribution, with pirnas mapping to the sense strand having a 5' terminal uracil, and pirnas mapping to antisense strand having an adenine at 10th position . this signature is characteristic for pirnas that have been generated via the ping-pong mechanism mentioned above.

an additional class of pirnas is the pachytene pirnas, which are found in large strand-specific clusters throughout the genome  <cit> . by employing a cluster identification algorithm based on the density of small rna sequences within a specific region , we found  <dig> strand specific clusters . pirna clusters are found on all the autosomes but are excluded from the x chromosome. the genomic distribution shows that clusters on the negative and the positive strand are often found in close proximity. close inspection reveals that these clusters are often adjacent and hardly overlapping. after merging adjacent clusters we obtained  <dig> unique locations in the genome with pirna clusters. whenever we find two large non-overlapping pirna clusters on opposite strands in close proximity these are found almost exclusively upstream of each other, with transcription pointing outwards , suggesting a nucleation mechanism on the border between these two clusters  <cit> .

the identified pirna clusters allow for probing the characteristics of these sequences compared to the rest of the genome . only  <dig> refseq curated genes  overlap with pirna clusters, and only  <dig> reside completely within a cluster. the gene products cover a broad range of functions, but no common function could be pinpointed . interestingly, the gene density in these clusters is more than three-fold increased compared to regions outside of pirna cluster. as previously reported, we confirm that rat pirna clusters are strongly depleted in repeat sequences compared to the rest of the genome  <cit> . although a high level of synteny among pirna clusters has been reported  <cit> , pirna clusters diverge at an elevated rate  <cit> . indeed, we find that the amount of conserved sequences, defined as having a phastcons score >  <dig>  in a multiple alignment of  <dig> vertebrate species  <cit> , showed a depletion of conserved sequences in these regions. in conclusion, pirna clusters are genomic regions with distinct sequence characteristics. their location and expression is maintained while their sequence diverges quickly. this would favor the idea that they target the region on which they are encoded  <cit> . alternatively, it may well be that they generate small rnas which act sequence independently.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed small rna dge profiling for six rat tissues to expand the set of experimentally verified mirnas and to gain biological insight into role of specific mirnas. in total, we added  <dig> mirna loci to the compendium of known rat mirnas  <cit> , providing experimental evidence for homologues of known mammalian mirna as well as novel highly confident candidate mirnas specific to the rat lineage. in addition to discovering novel mirnas we quantified expression levels of mirnas, creating a deep sequencing expression atlas of  <dig> tissues in two different rat inbred strains. this expression atlas can be an important instrument for understanding the evolution of mirna regulation, e.g. conserved expression patterns among mammalian species, but also species-specific expression patterns. our own experiments show strain-specific differences in mirna expression and could form the basis for understanding this process at the molecular level.

strain-specific mirna expression patterns as determined by dge can make important contributions to understand regulatory expression networks. the role of mirnas in complex traits has not been fully addressed yet. such traits are not inherited in a monogenic mendelian fashion, but are expected to be caused or modulated by subtle differences in multiple different types of regulation, including mirna-mediated regulation. our evidence for strain-specific mirna expression could imply that eqtls, which have been observed at the level of expression of protein-coding genes, could be partially explained by mirnas, especially when linked regions span large genomic distances. in such cases, these so-called trans eqtls could potentially be explained by differential mirna expression  and the linked region could thus be expected to be enriched for mirna target genes for this specific mirna. in conclusion, strain-specific expression of mirnas may help to identify and study these regulatory networks and facilitate target discovery for specific diseases.

in addition to transcriptional regulation, we confirmed the editing of known adar targets in rat, and discovered that, in addition to the known edited mirnas, mir- <dig> is edited in rat brains. since the physiology and neurobiology of the rat has been intensively studied, rat models could be an important experimental system for addressing the biological relevance of mirna editing. finally we provide an exhaustive list of pirna candidates.

the small rna inventories and profiles described here further improve the annotation of the rat genome, thereby facilitating functional genomics research and the investigation of the involvement of mirnas in complex genetic traits.
