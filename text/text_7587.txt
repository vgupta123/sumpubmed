BACKGROUND
a diverse pre-immune immunoglobulin  repertoire is essential to vertebrate survival. in chickens and other fowl, the ig heavy and light chain variable  regions are diversified by gene conversion, which transfers sequence information from upstream donor pseudo-v  regions to the rearranged and expressed heavy and light chain v regions   <cit> . v region diversification in fowl occurs in a specialized organ, the bursa. the chicken b cell line, dt <dig>  derives from a bursal lymphoma and constitutively diversifies both the heavy and light chain v regions by gene conversion  <cit> . dt <dig> also supports very high levels of homologous gene targeting, which has made it a valuable tool for genetic analysis of vertebrate cells as well as a powerful model for studying recombinational repair in a physiological context.

ig gene conversion is initiated by the b cell-specific enzyme, activation-induced deaminase   <cit> . aid deaminates c to u in transcribed ig genes, producing a u·g mismatch  <cit> ; uracil-dna glycosylase  removes u to produce an abasic site  <cit> ; and the mre11/rad50/nbs <dig>  complex promotes gene conversion  <cit>  using its abasic lyase activity to cleave at abasic sites  <cit> .

gene conversion and gene targeting are both impaired by deficiencies in factors involved in homology-directed repair, including mre <dig>  <cit> ; nbs <dig>  <cit> ; the five rad <dig> paralogs, rad51b, rad51c, rad51d, xrcc <dig> and xrcc <dig>  <cit> ; and brca <dig> and brca <dig>  <cit> . at the ig genes, deficiencies of these factors, or deletion of  <cit>  or repressive chromatin modifications at  <cit>  the ψvλ donors does not simply diminish the clonal rate of gene conversion, but alters the mutational spectrum so that nontemplated mutations appear, analogous to those produced in somatic hypermutation in activated mammalian b cells.

to better understand the gene conversion pathway and how it may relate to other processes of recombinational repair, we have defined the localization and functions of rad51d and xrcc <dig> in dt <dig> b cells. we find that rad51d and xrcc <dig> form constitutive foci in normally proliferating dt <dig> cells. single-cell imaging of dt <dig> polylaco-λr cells, in which the rearranged and expressed λr light chain gene can be visualized directly, showed that rad51d and xrcc <dig> localize to the rearranged λr allele. colocalization reflects function in the diversification mechanism, as it is diminished upon expression of ugi, which inhibits ung activity; and correlates with enrichment at the rearranged λr allele. in addition, ectopic expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> accelerated the clonal rate of ig gene conversion, and gene conversion tracts were significantly longer in rad51d than xrcc <dig> transfectants. these results support a model in which rad51d and xrcc <dig> participate directly in ig gene conversion. they also support the notion that modulation of levels of repair factors may be useful for gene therapy strategies based on targeted gene correction.

RESULTS
rad <dig>  rad51d-gfp and xrcc2-gfp form nuclear foci in dt <dig> b cells
the chicken dt <dig> b cell line was derived from a bursal lymphoma and carries out constitutive diversification of its ig genes by gene conversion  <cit> . the key homologous recombination factor, rad <dig>  has been shown to form constitutive nuclear foci in dt <dig> cells, which may reflect the recombinational activation characteristic of this cell line  <cit> . by staining with anti-rad <dig> antibodies, we readily identified rad <dig> foci in 31% of cells in an asynchronous culture .

to determine whether rad51d or xrcc <dig> form nuclear foci, we examined dt <dig> derivatives stably transfected with rad51d-gfp or xrcc2-gfp, expressing c-terminal gfp-tagged proteins to ensure specificity. as the gfp-tagged proteins did not produce a sufficiently strong signal for direct imaging, we stained with anti-gfp antibodies to amplify the signals, and imaged cells by fluorescence microscopy. staining with anti-gfp antibodies produced no background in untransfected dt <dig> cells ; but revealed constitutive punctate nuclear foci in normally proliferating dt <dig> rad51d-gfp cells . a parallel analysis of dt <dig> xrcc2-gfp transfectants similarly revealed constitutive punctate nuclear foci in normally proliferating cells .

rad51d-gfp and xrcc2-gfp localize to the rearranged λr gene
to further establish the significance of the rad <dig>  rad51d and xrcc <dig> foci, we took advantage of a cell line recently developed by our laboratory, which can be used to directly image the rearranged and diversifying λr allele in single b cells. in this line, dt <dig> polylaco-λr, polymerized lactose operator  is integrated within the ψvλ array just upstream of the rearranged and expressed λr light chain gene   <cit> . upon expression of red fluorescent protein fused to lactose repressor , rfp-laci binds to polylaco to enable λr to be imaged as a distinct red dot . localization of specific factors to the polylaco-tagged gene can be determined by calculating the fraction of cells in which the fluorescence signals of the gene and factor are overlapping .

we assayed λr/rad <dig> colocalizations in asynchronous dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci cells, and observed colocalizations in  <dig> % of cells . λr/rad51d-gfp colocalizations were observed in 15% of dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci rad51d-gfp cells . λr/xrcc2-gfp colocalizations were observed in  <dig> % of dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci xrcc2-gfp cells .

to confirm that colocalization evident by confocal imaging reflected bona fide colocalization within the nucleus, we generated three-dimensional image stacks of rad51d-gfp and xrcc2-gfp localizations at λr in dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci cells. these "z-stacks" showed that colocalization was evident in multiple serial sections .

λr/rad51d-gfp colocalization depends upon aid-initiated dna damage
some background intersection of signals is inevitable in cells analyzed by confocal microscopy. to test whether colocalizations reflected function in dna repair, we took advantage of the fact that the activity of ung can be inhibited by expression of ugi. ung acts subsequent to aid to remove the uracil that results from cytidine deamination, creating an abasic site for attack by repair factors. ung is essential in creation of the dna break necessary to ig gene conversion, and expression of ugi has been shown to prevent ig gene conversion in dt <dig> cells  <cit> . we generated stable dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci rad51d-gfp ugi transfectants, and compared colocalizations in these cells and in the parental dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci rad51d-gfp cell line. we found that ugi expression diminished the fraction of cells exhibiting λr/rad51d-gfp colocalizations from 15% to  <dig> % . thus, at least half of the λr/rad51d-gfp colocalizations reflect repair of lesions induced in the course of aid-initiated, ung-dependent ig gene diversification.

we have previously established the approximate level of background colocalizations in dt <dig> polylaco-λr cells of two other factors essential for ig gene diversification, polη-gfp  <cit>  and e2a  <cit> . polη-gfp colocalizes with λr in  <dig> % of normally proliferating dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci polη-gfp cells, but in only  <dig> % dt <dig> polylaco-λr rfp-laci polη-gfp ugi transfectants  <cit> . as e2a acts upstream of aid, background for colocalizations of e2a was determined somewhat differently, by comparing localizations to the rearranged and unrearranged λ gene  <cit> . colocalized λr/e2a foci are evident in 26% of dt <dig> polylaco-λr gfp-laci cells, and in only  <dig> % of dt <dig> polylaco-λu gfp-laci cells . thus, for the three factors analyzed thus far, rad51d-gfp, polη-gfp and e2a, background colocalization is in the range of  <dig>  -  <dig> %. by this criterion, the fraction of cells exhibiting λr/rad <dig> colocalizations is not significantly different from background, while the fraction of cells exhibiting colocalizations of rad51d-gfp or xrccc2-gfp is highly significant .

rad51d-gfp is enriched at the rearranged but not unrearranged λ allele
to further establish that the observed colocalizations at λr reflect events critical to the mechanism of ig gene conversion, we compared physical association of rad51d-gfp with the rearranged and diversifying or unrearranged and inactive λ alleles by chromatin immunoprecipitation . chromatin was immunoprecipitated from normally proliferating dt <dig> rad51d-gfp cells with a polyclonal anti-gfp antibody or with nonspecific igg control antibodies, and amplicons from either the rearranged or unrearranged vλ region were amplified in duplex pcr reactions, along with a control amplicon, ovalbumin, as previously described  <cit> . the rearranged vλr region was  <dig> -fold enriched relative to the ovalbumin control , but there was no significant enrichment of the unrearranged vλu region . the level of enrichment was reproducible in three independent experiments. it is comparable to levels previously documented for association of rad51d at breaks generated by i-scei cleavage in mammalian cells  <cit> ; and also in the range for association of other repair factors at target loci in eukaryotic cells, where interactions may be transient or occur only in only a small fraction of cells  <cit> .

rad51d or xrcc <dig> expression accelerated ig gene diversification in chicken b cells, but not human b cells
to assay rad51d and xrcc <dig> function in ig gene diversification, we generated panels of stable, independent transfectants of a surface igm-positive  subclone of dt <dig> expressing rad51d-gfp, rad51d, xrcc2-gfp, xrcc <dig>  or a gfp control gene. following clonal expansion, the diversification rate in each culture was determined using the sigm loss assay  <cit> , which quantitates the fraction of descendants of a single sigm+ cell which have become sigm- as a consequence of diversification. the sigm loss assay detects acceleration or deceleration of the clonal diversification rate due not only to templated mutations, but also base substitutions, deletions and insertions that occur if the templated pathway has been impaired, as occurs if the balance of repair is disrupted, leading to mutagenesis rather than gene correction  <cit> . the fraction of sigm- cells was normalized to the mean fraction of loss variants in the control gfp transfectants . this showed that the fraction of sigm- cells was  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  higher in the rad51d-gfp and rad51d transfectants, respectively, relative to the control . similarly, the fraction of sigm- cells was  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold  higher in the xrcc2-gfp and xrcc <dig> transfectants . thus, expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> accelerated ig gene diversification. acceleration could reflect an increase in the fraction of cells undergoing diversification, or acceleration of the reaction kinetics in individual cells.

to confirm that rad51d or xrcc <dig> expression affects homology-directed repair but not other processes that diversify v region sequence, we asked if stable expression of rad51d or xrcc <dig> affected clonal diversification in derivatives of the constitutively hypermutating human b cell line ramos. the fraction of sigm loss variants was almost identical in stable ramos transfectants expressing rad51d-gfp or xrcc2-gfp as in gfp control transfectants . thus ectopic expression of rad51d and xrcc <dig> promotes homology-directed repair but does not influence somatic hypermutation, which is homology-independent.

ectopic expession of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> promotes gene conversion
to ask whether ectopic rad51d or xrcc <dig> expression promoted gene conversion or other mutagenic pathways, single sigm- cells of transfectants were isolated by flow cytometry, and vλ regions were pcr-amplified and sequenced. after elimination of germline and duplicate sequences, sequences carrying unique mutations or combinations of mutations were aligned with the sequences of the ψvλ regions. potential donors for each mutation were identified, if present in the ψvλ array, and the minimum homology that existed between potential ψvλ donors and recipient genes was determined for each sequence. following the established convention  <cit> ), changes from the germline sequence that shared a region of identity at least  <dig> bp in length with one or more ψvλ donors were identified as gene conversion events. changes with no match, or which matched within a region <  <dig> bp in length, were identified as point mutations.

from  <dig> independently transfected lines expressing rad51d, sequences of  <dig> vλ regions were determined, and  <dig> unique mutated sequences further analyzed . this analysis showed that these sequences contained a total of  <dig> single base substitutions, insertions or deletions,  <dig> of which were due to gene conversion. thus, in rad51d transfectants, 93% of mutations match sequences in ψvλ donors.

a similar analysis was carried out on  <dig> independently transfected lines expressing xrcc <dig>  from which sequences of  <dig> vλ regions were determined, and  <dig> unique sequences further analyzed. these harbored a total of  <dig> single base changes,  <dig> of which matched sequences of ψvλ donors, and thus appeared to result from gene conversion . thus, in xrcc <dig> transfectants, 97% of sequence changes match sequences in ψvλ donors.

rad51d expression increases gene conversion tract lengths
gene conversion repair tract lengths can be estimated by determining the boundaries of homology between each tract recipient and its possible ψvλ donors. these homologies were determined for the dt <dig> rad51d and dt <dig> xrcc <dig> transfectants. a mutation was scored as templated only if there was homology to a ψvλ donor within a window at least  <dig> nt in length, so  <dig> nt was the lower limit on tract length. homologies ranged from 9- <dig> bp in vλ regions of rad51d transfectants , and from 9- <dig> bp in vλ regions of xrcc <dig> transfectants . the average minimum repair tract length was thereby estimated to be  <dig>  bp in rad51d transfectants; and  <dig>  bp in xrcc <dig> transfectants. this difference is highly significant . the average minimum tract length in control gfp transfectants was  <dig>  bp , significantly different from rad51d transfectants  but comparable to xrcc <dig> transfectants . thus, rad51d expression resulted in longer tract lengths.

we also distinguished the fraction of templated events that contained two or more templated base changes, rather than a single base change. in the dt <dig> rad51d transfectants, a minimum of  <dig> gene conversion events could account for all the templated changes in the sequenced vλ regions,  <dig>  of which caused changes at two or more nt; and three that caused a change at a single nt .  in the dt <dig> xrcc <dig> transfectants, a minimum of  <dig> gene conversion events could account for all mutation tracts,  <dig>  resulting in ≥  <dig> changes and  <dig>  resulting in a single nt change . thus, the fraction of gene conversion events producing ≥  <dig> templated base differences was strikingly different between rad51d and xrcc <dig> transfectants .

discussion
the five rad <dig> paralogs have previously been shown to be necessary for ig gene conversion in experiments demonstrating that ablation of any of these genes causes aid-initiated mutagenesis to switch from a templated to a nontemplated repair pathway  <cit> . we have presented several kinds of evidence consistent with direct function of both rad51d and xrcc <dig> in ig gene conversion. imaging colocalizations with λr provided one snapshot of events in ig gene conversion. we documented λr/rad51d-gfp colocalizations in 15% of cells, and λr/xrcc2-gfp colocalizations in  <dig> % of cells, both significantly greater than background. colocalizations were shown to correlate both functionally and physically with active ig gene conversion. in addition, ectopic expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> accelerated ig gene conversion in chicken dt <dig> b cells, but did not affect the rate of diversification in human ramos b cells, which depend upon low fidelity polymerases and not homologous recombination to repair dna damage initiated by the activity of aid. notably, expression of rad51d but not xrcc <dig> increased the conversion tract length.

dt <dig> cells are unusual in that they contain constitutive foci of repair factors, including the key recombination factor, rad <dig>  <cit>  as well as the rad51d and xrcc <dig> foci that we have documented. these constitutive foci probably reflect the recombinationally active state of dt <dig> b cells, which support ongoing ig gene conversion and very efficient homologous gene targeting. while it is not possible to confirm that gene conversion is ongoing at a specific λr allele imaged in a single cell, expression of ugi, which inhibits gene conversion, caused a 50% reduction in the fraction of cells exhibiting λr/rad51d-gfp colocalizations. this functional analysis suggests that about half the colocalizations observed are at sites of active gene conversion. other colocalizations may reflect background inherent to confocal microscopy, a possibility consistent with evidence that expression of ugi similarly reduced λr/polη-gfp colocalizations by approximately 50%  <cit> . participation in the gene conversion mechanism was further supported by establishing that rad51d-gfp is specifically enriched at the rearranged λr allele, which undergoes diversification; and not at the inactive, unrearranged λu allele.

the fraction of cells in which colocalizations are evident will be determined both by the fraction of cells in which colocalizations occur and by the duration of colocalization. λr/rad <dig> colocalizations were evident in only  <dig> % of cells, not significantly greater than background. the absence of a significant fraction of cells exhibiting λr/rad <dig> colocalizations could mean that rad <dig> associations with the diversifying ig genes are relatively transient; alternatively, ig gene conversion may represent a specialized pathway in which recombination does not depend upon rad <dig> 

accelerated gene conversion and increased tract length in dt <dig> rad51d transfectants
expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> caused comparable 3-fold acceleration in the rate of diversification, as measured by the sigm loss assay. distinct mechanisms could account for this increase. expression of these factors may cause a greater fraction of cells to carry out productive diversification, or alter the reaction kinetics of diversification in individual cells.

gene conversion tracts were significantly longer in dt <dig> rad51d than dt <dig> xrcc <dig> transfectants. in the latter cell lines tract length was identical to that in control dt <dig> gfp transfectants. gene conversion tract length is almost certainly closely regulated in vivo, as tract length has clear biological consequences. short conversion tracts may be advantageous at diversifying ig genes as they enable the recipient gene to accumulate a patchwork of mutations from multiple different donors, which contributes diversity to the repertoire. short conversion tracts will also cause modulated rather than drastic changes in antibody specificity. in contrast, longer conversion tracts would tend to create greater diversity in the same number of rounds of diversification; but would overwrite not only germline sequence but also sequence from previous rounds of gene conversion, in effect erasing mutations.

possible implications for gene correction strategies
there is considerable interest in the possibility of correcting mutations associated with genetic disease by gene correction  <cit> . in this approach, a dna break is targeted at or near a defective gene, and ensuing dna repair uses a homologous donor to correct the genetic defect, thereby restoring gene function. strategies for elevating the efficiency of gene correction have focused on each of the steps in this pathway. efforts to design nucleases that create specific breaks have met with encouraging recent success  <cit> . a critical limitation is the relatively low efficiency of homology-directed repair in most vertebrate cell types. in a few cases it has been shown that homology-directed repair, or the related process of homologous gene targeting, can be enhanced by increasing or diminishing levels of specific repair factors  <cit> . this has suggested that systematic analysis of the ability of repair factors to stimulate homology-directed repair might identify useful strategies to promote targeted gene correction. our results identify rad51d and xrcc <dig> as potential candidates for such approaches.

it is not possible to know whether a factor that promotes gene conversion at the ig genes in chicken b lymphocytes would have a similar function in other cell types or other species. nonetheless, by establishing that ectopic expression of repair factors can enhance homologous recombination in this context, our results provide proof in principle for the likely utility of extending this approach to other targets and other cell types. the ability of rad51d expression to augment repair tract length is of particular potential utility for application to targeted gene correction. in targeted gene correction, repair tract length in effect determines how near a target mutation nuclease cleavage can occur and still promote useful repair. thus, longer tracts are predicted to be advantageous in this context. the evidence that ectopic expression of rad51d enhances both the clonal efficiency of gene conversion and repair tract length suggests the utility of considering both these parameters in future efforts to promote gene correction.

CONCLUSIONS
dt <dig> contains constitutive nuclear foci of the repair factors rad51d and xrcc <dig>  consistent with activated homologous recombination. single-cell imaging of dt <dig> polylaco-λr cells showed that rad51d and xrcc <dig> localize to the diversifying λr gene. colocalization correlates with function in diversification, and with physical association with the rearranged λr allele. ectopic expression of either rad51d or xrcc <dig> accelerated the clonal rate of gene conversion, and conversion tracts were significantly longer in rad51d than xrcc <dig> transfectants. these results demonstrate direct functions of rad51d and xrcc <dig> in immunoglobulin gene conversion, and also suggest that modulation of levels of repair factors may be a useful strategy for gene correction in other cell types.
