BACKGROUND
apoptosis is a major form of cell death, characterized by a series of apoptosis-specific morphological alterations and nucleosomal dna fragmentation of genomic dna  <cit> . recent studies toward understanding of the apoptosis machinery have revealed the essential roles of a family of cysteine aspartyl proteases named caspases . to date,  <dig> caspases have been implicated in the apoptotic and inflammatic pathway cascades: caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis, whereas caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> participate in the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation  <cit> . apoptotic caspases can be subdivided into initiator and executioner caspases. they are normally expressed as proenzymes that mature to their fully functional form through proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . autoprocessing of initiator caspases  is facilitated by adaptor proteins, such as the fas-associated death domain protein  and apoptosis protease activating factor- <dig> . executioner caspases  can be activated following proteolytic processing by initiator caspases  <cit> . activated executioner caspases cleave a critical set of cellular proteins selectively and in a coordinated manner leading to cell death. more than  <dig> caspase substrates have been identified to date  <cit> .

the caspase cascades in apoptosis maintain and amplify the original apoptotic stimuli, and their disregulations are involved as key factors in the development of a variety of diseases, including alzheimers's disease  <cit> , parkinson's disease  <cit>  and cancer  <cit> . in particular, caspase- <dig> has been characterized as the major contributor to the process of apoptosis, and the phenotype of caspase- <dig> knockout mice suggests the necessity of the enzyme during brain development  <cit> . therefore, studies with peptide inhibitors of caspase- <dig> have helped to define a central role for the enzyme in apoptosis. so far, several peptide inhibitors of caspase- <dig> have been reported  <cit> , some of which were effective in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   <cit> , sepsis  <cit> , and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury  <cit> .

among caspases, the structures of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> have been determined by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . the three-dimensional structures reveal that the active sites of all caspases contain positively charged s <dig> subsites that bind the negatively charged asp in the p <dig> position on the substrates. since the s <dig> subsites are highly conserved, all caspases cleave solely after aspartate residues  <cit> . recognition of at least four amino acids  in the cleavage sites is also a necessary requirement for efficient catalysis. the s2–s <dig> subsites on caspases vary significantly, resulting in varied substrate specificities for the p2–p <dig> positions, despite an absolute requirement for asp in the p <dig> position  <cit> . to define the peptide substrate specificities at the p2–p <dig> positions of caspases, a combinatorial approach using a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library  was taken. as a result, the optimal recognition sequence of peptide substrate for caspase- <dig> was shown to be devd  <cit> . the sequence devd within poly polymerase  is known to be recognized and cleaved by caspase- <dig>  <cit> . this sequence has been applied to creating the peptide aldehyde inhibitor ac-devd-cho. however, ac-devd-cho inhibits not only caspase- <dig> activity, but also the activities of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> . to date, therefore, no tetrapeptide inhibitor selective for caspase- <dig> has yet to be identified.

it should be possible to derive the most selective and potent peptide inhibitor for each caspase from its comprehensive tetrapeptide library. in this regard, we recently developed a new strategy named the apf method for the computational design of peptides with high affinities for target proteins  <cit> . this computational virtual screening method allows the rapid prediction of binding free energies between all peptides being tested and a target protein. recently, we used this method to identify potent peptide inhibitors of caspase- <dig>  importantly, a novel specific peptide inhibitor, ac-dnld-cho, was shown to have almost the same potent inhibitory activity against caspase- <dig> as the well-known ac-devd-cho. in this study, we investigated the structural and functional relevance to potency and selectivity of this rationally designed peptide by enzyme kinetic analyses, computational docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis analysis. the results identify the specific interaction of the p <dig> position  in dnld with the s <dig>  subsite on caspase- <dig> as the most important determinant of the selectivity of ac-dnld-cho.

RESULTS
potency and selectivity of ac-dnld-cho against caspase-3
at present, three peptide inhibitors  of caspase- <dig>  ac-devd-cho, ac-dqtd-cho, and ac-dmqd-cho, are commercially available. therefore, we compared the potency and selectivity of these peptide inhibitors with ac-dnld-cho using human recombinant caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  as shown fig. 1a, ac-dnld-cho inhibits caspase- <dig>  with almost the same potency as ac-devd-cho . the apparent kiapp values for ac-dnld-cho and ac-devd-cho are calculated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  nm, respectively . ac-devd-cho inhibits caspase- <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig>  to similar extents. this observation is consistent with the previous report that ac-devd-cho inhibits caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, ac-dnld-cho has very low inhibitory activity against caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  although ac-dnld-cho inhibits caspase- <dig>  the ic <dig>  is one-order of magnitude higher than that of ac-devd-cho . it is noteworthy that ac-dnld-cho exhibits an approximate by 80-fold selectivity for caspase- <dig> over caspase- <dig>  , although these caspases have very similar protein structures and substrate preferences  <cit> .

a kiapp was calculated from the ic <dig> value, kiapp = ic50/, where km is the michaelis constant of the substrate and  is the substrate concentration in the assay.

ac-dqtd-cho inhibits caspases- <dig>  and - <dig>  weakly as compared to ac-devd-cho, and inhibits caspase- <dig>  and - <dig>  even more weakly . these inhibition curves for ac-dqtd-cho are shifted about one order of magnitude lower than those of ac-devd-cho. on the other hand, ac-dmqd-cho inhibits caspase- <dig> weakly , whereas it has little inhibitory effect on caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> even at concentrations up to about  <dig> nm . the kinetic analyses show ac-dnld-cho to have a potent and selective inhibitory activity against caspase- <dig>  whereas ac-devd-cho potently inhibits all four caspases tested.

abilities of caspases to cleave the fluorometric substrate of dnld
to determine the potency and selectivity of the dnld sequence against caspase- <dig>  we compared substrate preferences between dnld and devd among caspases. currently, ac-devd-mca is used as the substrate for caspase- <dig> . unfortunately, caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> are also able to cleave this substrate , consistent with the previous observation  <cit>  that although caspase- <dig> is the major source of cellular devdase activity in apoptotic cell extracts, other caspases are considered to contribute to the devdase activity. that is, devdase is not necessarily equivalent to the true activity of caspase- <dig>  from these data, it is clear that using ac-devd-mca as a substrate makes it hard to measure precisely the activity of caspase- <dig> alone in crude cell extracts.

to probe the functional difference between dnld and devd sequences, we synthesized ac-dnld-mca and examined its preference as a substrate. as shown in fig. 2a, ac-dnld-mca is cleaved as efficiently by caspase- <dig> as ac-devd-mca. importantly, ac-dnld-mca is hardly cleaved by caspase- <dig> . additionally, caspases- <dig> and - <dig> have no ability to cleave ac-dnld-mca . this implies that using ac-dnld-mca makes it possible to measure the sole activity of caspase- <dig> in cell extracts. taken together, these data suggest that the recognition of the dnld sequence among the caspases is selective to caspase- <dig> 

definition of active site residues of caspases
in order to understand the specificity of the sequence dnld for caspase- <dig> in the structural aspects, we next sought to determine the amino acid residues composing the active sites of caspases. by inspecting the interactions of peptide/caspase complexes in their x-ray structures  <cit> , we identified fifteen and fourteen residues in the active sites of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  respectively . the active site residues are located in segments on the linear sequences of caspases , and construct similar  <dig> dimensional pockets of the active sites . from these data,  <dig> subsites   can be assigned that indicate common structural positions in the active sites of all caspases .

the aligned active site residues in each caspase construct almost the same subsites. the difference is that the active site residues  of caspases- <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig>  and - <dig>  belonging to the s2– <dig> subsites are aligned at the same position in the sequences, while those of caspases- <dig>  and - <dig>  are aligned at different positions . however, the structural superposition of these caspases  reveals that these amino acids are located at the same position  in the s <dig> subsites . previous work has also shown that caspase- <dig> has y <dig> situated in roughly the same spatial position as f <dig> of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . thus, using the primary and tertiary structural information about caspases, we identified the amino acid residues important for substrate binding in the active sites of caspases as illustrated in fig.  <dig> in a model of devd binding.

evaluation of active site definition
fig.  <dig> shows the plots of the free energies of binding calculated by autodock  <cit>  and the experimentally observed kiapp values summarized in table  <dig>  the best value obtained for ac-dnld-cho is - <dig>  kcal/mol . importantly, there are good correlations between all the calculated free energies of binding of ac-dnld-cho to caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and their observed kiapp values. the correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  obtained from the plots is an appropriate value, suggesting that the autodock program used here produces reliable binding modes, and that the definition of amino acid residues composing the active sites of caspases is adequate.

phylogenetic analysis of the apoptotic caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> shows that executioner caspases  belong to the same subfamily and initiator caspases  belong to other subfamilies, thus reflecting their functional roles . if our active site definition is adequate, a similar phylogenetic analysis against the active site residues defined above  would reflect their substrate specificities. the phylogenetic analysis of the active site residues was conducted by the nj algorithm  <cit> . interestingly, the active site phylogeny is consistent with the substrate specificities of caspases . nicholson and co-workers have clearly demonstrated that caspases are divided into three groups on the basis of substrate specificity analysis using a combinatorial approach: group i enzymes  prefer ehd↓ peptides; group ii enzymes  prefer dexd↓ peptides; group iii enzymes  prefer exd↓ peptides  <cit> . as shown in fig. 6b, caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  are classified into together, and other caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  fall into other classes. it should be noted that caspase- <dig> belongs to the same class as caspases- <dig> and - <dig> in our active site phylogenetic analysis , although caspase- <dig> is suggested to be an initiator caspase . the results strongly support the validity of our active site definition as illustrated in fig. 4b.

evaluation of docking program for binding mode analysis
to elucidate the reason that ac-dnld-cho is a potent and selective inhibitor for caspase- <dig> even though it has the same dxxd motif as ac-devd-cho, ac-dqtd-cho, and ac-dmqd-cho, computational docking studies were employed. we performed docking analysis using the autodock algorithm  <cit>  to examine the binding modes of the peptide inhibitors at the active sites of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> 

among the above caspase inhibitors, a well-known ac-devd-cho was docked into the active sites of caspases, and then we measured how close the autodock can reproduce their complex structures of ac-devd-cho/caspase. superpositions with the most minimized energies of docked ac-devd-cho in complexes of ac-devd-cho/caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> yield root mean square distances  of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å, and  <dig>  Å, respectively . hence, autodock analysis is successful in reproducing the binding conformation of tetrapeptide inhibitors . furthermore, the results indicate that our docking procedures  are reliable.

selective binding mode of ac-dnld-cho with caspase-3
to understand the binding mode of ac-dnld-cho with caspase- <dig>  ac-dnld-cho was docked onto the active site of caspase- <dig> by the autodock program . the main-chain of ac-dnld-cho forms hydrogen bonds at nh  – o , o  – nh , o  – hh <dig> , and nh  – o  in the s <dig> and s <dig> subsites, respectively . asp in the p <dig> position of ac-dnld-cho donates hydrogen bonds to the asp <dig>  trp <dig>  and phe <dig>  and asp in the p <dig> position interacts with arg <dig>  all of these interactions are observed in the complex of ac-devd-cho/caspase- <dig> although the hydrogen bonding distances and angles are slightly different . it should be noted that asn  and leu  in ac-dnld-cho have characteristic interaction patterns with caspase-3; the hd of asn  forms a direct hydrogen bond with og of ser <dig>  and does not interact with arg <dig> , while leu in the p <dig> position forms tight hydrophobic contacts with trp <dig>  tyr <dig>  and phe <dig> in the s <dig> subsite of caspase- <dig>  meanwhile, the glu in the p <dig> position of ac-devd-cho forms a direct interaction with arg <dig> but not ser <dig>  although water-mediated interactions with ser <dig> and/or ser <dig> may exist 

a hydrogen bonding interactions of ac-dnld-cho and caspase- <dig> were obtained from autodock docking simulations  <cit> .

bhydrogen bonding interactions of ac-devd-cho and caspase- <dig> were obtained from the crystal structure.

cthe change in accessible surface area  per leu <dig> or val <dig> residue upon dissociation of the complex structure was calculated by dssp  <cit> , and then mainly the results from the interactions with the s <dig> subsite. in calculating the Δasa, it was assumed that no conformational changes in the peptide inhibitors or caspase- <dig> occur upon dissociation.

importantly, the s3– <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> have a conserved pro residue . consequently, a hydrogen bond between asn  in ac-dnld-cho and the s3– <dig> subsite  of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> can not be formed . furthermore, in the hydrophobic s <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig>  and - <dig> , leu  of ac-dnld-cho is difficult to be accepted . in contrast, since the arg at the s3- <dig> subsites is conserved in all caspase family proteins , the interactions of glu  of ac-devd-cho with the s3- <dig> subsites are considered to decrease the selectivity while they increase the binding affinities of ac-devd-cho . the hydrophobic contacts between val  of ac-devd-cho and the s <dig> subsites are probably weaker than those between leu  of ac-dnld-cho and the s <dig> subsites . this prediction is supported by comparisons of the changes in accessible surface area  between leu  and val , which are calculated to be  <dig> and  <dig> Å  <dig>  respectively . because it is known that there is good correlation between the amount of nonpolar surface of higher Δasa and hydrophobic interactions  <cit> , the Δasa of leu  of ac-dnld-cho may bear to the potent binding affinity through the hydrophobic effect.

alanine replacement analysis for specific recognition of dnld by caspase-3
the above computational docking experiments suggest that the specific recognition of dnld sequence by caspase- <dig> is attributable to the notable hydrogen bond between asn  and ser <dig> .

to prove the significance of ser <dig> in the interaction of the substrate asn, the caspase- <dig> residue ser <dig> was replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis and the effect on recognition of dnld was determined using mca-fused peptide substrates. the substituted  and wild-type caspase- <dig>  were generated by coexpression of ha-p <dig> and ha-p <dig> subunits in in vitro translation system . the mutant caspase- <dig> cleaved ac-devd-mca as efficient as the wild-type. in contrast, the substitution  resulted in greater than 60% loss of cleavage activity on ac-dnld-mca . these results strongly support the computational prediction that the specific interaction of dnld with caspase- <dig> is attributable to the hydrogen bond between asn  and ser <dig> in the s3– <dig> subsite.

specific interaction of ac-dnld-cho with caspase-3
to examine the specificity of ac-dnld-cho for caspase- <dig>  the binding mode was further compared with ac-dqtd-cho and ac-dmqd-cho. ac-dqtd-cho, which inhibits caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> activities with kiapp values of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm, and  <dig>  nm, respectively , has a similar selectivity for these caspases as ac-devd-cho, and its potency is one-order of magnitude lower than that of ac-devd-cho . the reasons for the poor selectivity of ac-dqtd-cho as compared with ac-dnld-cho may be due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between gln  with the arg <dig> , asn <dig> , arg <dig> , or arg <dig>  as in the case of ac-devd-cho, and weak hydrophobic contacts with the s <dig> subsites of all caspases .

on the other hand, ac-dmqd-cho, which inhibits the activities of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> with kiapp values of  <dig>  nm, > <dig> nm, > <dig> nm, and > <dig> nm, respectively , has unique selectivity for caspase- <dig>  but with low potency for all. this may be attributed to a lack of interaction between gln  and the s <dig> subsite . meanwhile, no side-chain hydrogen bonds between met  of ac-dmqd-cho and the s3- <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig>  and - <dig> are formed. in the cases of caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  the formation of hydrogen bonds between met  and the arg  in the s3- <dig> subsites is possible . these results strongly support the specificity of ac-dnld-cho for caspase- <dig>  the biding modes used in this analysis are available in additional data file .

discussion
ac-dnld-cho is the first reported example of a novel potent peptide inhibitor of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . the sequence was rationally designed by the structure-based computational apf method, and is so far not known in any natural caspase substrate. furthermore, ac-dnld-cho has been shown to inhibit caspase- <dig> as potently as ac-devd-cho, a well-known caspase- <dig> inhibitor. these observations suggest that the apf method is useful to design effective peptides with high binding affinities for target proteins. in the present study, we examined the specificity of ac-dnld-cho for caspase- <dig> by inhibition kinetics analysis, computational docking studies and site-directed mutagenesis. in our in vitro assay system, ac-dnld-cho inhibits caspase- <dig>  more selectively than caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> . these observed kiapp values correlate well with the calculated free energies of binding  by autodock between ac-dnld-cho and caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> . in plots of the calculated Δgcalc values and experimentally observed kiapp values, a correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  was obtained. this implies that the autodock produces reliable binding conformations of tetrapeptides on caspase molecules and that it is suitable for the analysis of the binding modes of tetrapeptide/caspase complexes.

the docking studies data reveal the notable characteristics of ac-dnld-cho binding to caspase- <dig> to be the hydrogen bonds between asn  and ser <dig> in the s3– <dig> subsite of caspase- <dig>  and the tightly hydrophobic contacts between leu in the p <dig> position and the s <dig> subsite composed of three aromatic amino acids, tyr <dig>  trp <dig>  and phe <dig>  in the s <dig> subsite of caspase- <dig>  ser <dig>  is highly preferred for the interaction with asn , although other residues such as arg can be accommodated, as observed in the case of caspase- <dig> . a weak side chain-side chain hydrogen bond is formed between arg <dig>  of caspase- <dig> and asn  rather than that formed between ser <dig>  of caspase- <dig> and asn . hence, asn in ac-dnld-cho is the only peptide residue involved in a side-chain-specific hydrogen bond with ser <dig>  in the caspase- <dig> molecule.

the alignment of active site residues also supports these characteristic, and provides the information for speculating the binding ability of ac-dnld-cho to other apoptotic caspases. the s3– <dig> subsites of caspases show considerable diversity in their amino acids and in their interaction with asn  of ac-dnld-cho, which is only possible for caspase- <dig>  in caspase- <dig>  asn  is able to interact with arg <dig>  only when the conformation of the main-chain backborn is considerably changed . arg <dig>  arg <dig>  arg  <dig>  and arg <dig>  in caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively, do not interact with asn . meanwhile, the glu in the p <dig> position of ac-devd-cho binds to arg <dig>  in caspase- <dig>  the s3- <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  however, are also conserved as arg residues. therefore, glu  probably interacts tightly with arg  in all of the caspases. obviously, substitution of glu with asn in the p <dig> position results in a substantial increase in the selectivity of dnld for caspase- <dig> 

on the other hand, amino acid residues in the p <dig> positions of peptides such as leu and val are highly preferred in the hydrophobic pockets in s <dig> subsites except for caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  furthermore, the s <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig> and - <dig> have three hydrophobic aromatic residues. the structural analyse combined with the inhibitory activities suggest a critical role for the hydrophobic interactions between leu  in ac-dnld-cho and the s <dig> subsite of caspase- <dig>  since the Δasa of leu  is wider than val  of ac-devd-cho . furthermore, although the docking information obtained by the comparison of dnld with devd is somewhat difficult to understand completely, the stereochemical configuration of the peptide is important for both binding and inhibitory activity, while the loss of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are critical.

the specific inhibitory activity of ac-dnld-cho against caspase- <dig> is also confirmed by the comparison of both inhibitory activities and binding modes with commercially available caspase- <dig> peptide inhibitors, ac-dqtd-cho and ac-dmqd-cho . the gln  side chain of ac-dqtd-cho can make contact with args in the s3- <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  the thr in the p <dig> position interacts with hydrophobic pockets in the s <dig> subsites in all caspases. hence, ac-dqtd-cho shows less selectivity and a lower inhibitory activity than ac-dnld-cho. on the other hand, for ac-dmqd-cho, the met substitution in the p <dig> position, which might reduce its ability to form hydrogen bonds with arg in s3- <dig> subsites of caspases- <dig> and - <dig>  resulting in a substantial decrease in inhibitory activity . the substitution leu or val by gln in the p <dig> position results in a complete lack of interaction, thereby drastically decreasing the inhibitory activity. on the basis of these docking studies, the specific inhibitory activity of ac-dnld-cho on caspase- <dig> is strongly suggested to be due to the selective hydrogen bond between asn  and ser <dig> in the s3– <dig> subsite, and the tightly hydrophobic contacts of leu  with the aromatic amino acids tyr <dig>  trp <dig>  and phe <dig> in the s <dig> subsite.

furthermore, we performed critical examinations of the sequence specificity of dnld using fluorogenic mca-peptide substrates, since in general, recognition of peptide sequence is detected more stringently in substrates than inhibitors. as expected, the fluorogenic substrate ac-dnld-mca exhibited high selectivity for caspase- <dig> over caspases- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  this implies that ac-dnld-mca is useful for the precise measurement of the activity of caspase- <dig> in crude apoptotic cell extracts. in site-directed mutagenesis studies, the substituted  caspase- <dig> considerably decreased the ability to cleave ac-dnld-mca . this is consistent with the computationally predicted binding mode of ac-dnld-cho on caspase- <dig> . obviously, the hydrogen bond between the caspase- <dig> residue ser <dig> and the substrate asn  plays a critical role in the specificity of the peptide.

recently, to monitor the time course of caspase- <dig> activation during apoptosis at the cellular level, an expressed fusion protein containing cyan fluorescent protein  linked by a short peptide possessing the caspase- <dig> cleavage sequence, devd, to yellow fluorescent protein   has been utilized  <cit> . the protein undergoes fluorescence resonance energy transfer  between cfp and yfp. when caspase- <dig> is activated, the devd sequence is cleaved and fret is reduced  <cit> . by using the dnld sequence, a more precise measurement is possible.

previous studies have indicated that peptide-based caspase inhibitors are effective in animal models of als  <cit> , sepsis  <cit> , and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury  <cit> . some inhibitors, however, have poor whole cell activity due to limited cell permeability  <cit> . in this study, although the in vivo use of ac-dnld-cho was not performed, the activity would be enhanced by modifying the dnld sequence with benzylcarboxy, methyl ester, and fluoromethyl ketone  nld-fmk) or protein transduction domains , such as the tat protein  <cit> , antennapedia homeodomain  <cit> , or arginine-rich peptides  <cit>  . furthermore, many peptide-mimetic caspase- <dig> inhibitors have been prepared based on the devd tetrapeptide.  <cit> . as has been suggested previously  <cit> , the optimization of a binding peptide sequence for a target protein, such as dnld, includes obtaining sufficient information about its subsequent conversion to small molecular non-peptidic compounds. the dnld tetrapeptide characterized here, with a molecular mass of about  <dig>  is within reach of small molecule design and can serve as a minimal model for a caspase specific inhibitor. therefore, the optimized peptide-based design of small molecule mimetics would be expected to be possible by using the configuration with the lowest Δg. in developing non-peptidic caspase-3-specific inhibitors, the dnld tetrapeptide provides a valuable starting point for the design of specific peptide-mimetics and their optimization. for example, a unique side chain containing an amide is present at the p <dig> position of dnld, suggesting that this is a critical target region in the design of caspase-3-specific small molecules and potential therapeutic agents.

CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of our results, we conclude that ac-dnld-cho is a reliable, potent and selective inhibitor of caspase- <dig>  the binding site for dnld comprises the same active pockets of caspase- <dig> that are known to kind other inhibitory peptides such as devd, dqtd, and dmqd. the substituted residues asn and leu in the p <dig> and p <dig> positions, respectively, play important roles in both the selectivity and potency for caspase- <dig>  the specific inhibitory effect on caspase- <dig> suggests that this inhibitor could become an important tool for investigations of the biological function of caspase- <dig>  ac-dnld-mca could also be useful in determining whether caspase- <dig> acts in cells that respond to various apoptotic stimuli such as drugs and viruses. furthermore, ac-dnld-cho may be an attractive lead compound to generate novel effective non-peptidic pharmaceuticals for caspase-mediated apoptosis diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and viral infection diseases.
