BACKGROUND
extraembryonic tissues have transient functions to protect, nourish and pattern embryos during embryogenesis, but their cellular descendants are not incorporated into the adult body. extraembryonic tissues are distinct from maternal tissues in that they are either part of the primary oocyte, for instance the yolk, or produced by embryonic cells. examples of human extraembryonic tissues are the placenta and its trophoblast cell progenitors, as well as the yolk sac and its hypoblast cell progenitors  <cit> . in teleost fish, the yolk, the yolk syncytial layer  and the enveloping layer  have long been considered to be extraembryonic  <cit> . this definition may need to be revised for the zebrafish evl, as well as for the mouse hypoblast, because it was recently shown that some descendants of each of these tissues are incorporated into the adult body  <cit> .

zebrafish evl cells first form at two hours post fertilization   <cit> . this and the formation of primordial germ cells are the earliest differentiation steps in zebrafish embryogenesis  <cit> . evl cells form a superficial epithelium that surrounds and protects embryonic cells, and the evl is ultimately anchored to the ysl  <cit> .

the ysl forms between the yolk and overlying embryonic cells at around  <dig>  hpf, during the mid-blastula transition, when activation of the zygotic genome occurs  <cit> . the ysl forms via the collapse of a subset of embryonic margin cells, which are the outermost embryonic cells adjacent to the yolk. this produces an aqueous extraembryonic layer between the lipid-rich yolk and the embryo. this layer is comprised of multiple nuclei, other cellular organelles and a dense mesh of cytoskeletal proteins. ysl nuclei are initially restricted to the exterior of the yolk, in a region called the external ysl . the e-ysl nuclei undergo several rounds of synchronous division. at the onset of epiboly, which is the first concerted movement of embryonic cells, a number of ysl nuclei spread inwards to occupy the interior yolk-embryo interface, a region called the inner ysl   <cit> .

ysl nuclei are transcriptionally active. evidence for this is found in genes like mxtx <dig> that are expressed exclusively in the ysl  <cit> . the ysl layer is also able to translate mrna into protein. for instance, injection of an mrna encoding the nodal-related  <dig>  ligand into the ysl leads to the activation of downstream targets in marginal embryonic cells <cit> .

the ysl and evl have several functions in development. these include the ysl's processing and delivery of nutritive lipids from the yolk, the evl's role as a permeability barrier, and the action of both tissues in driving epiboly  <cit> . the ysl of blastula-stage embryos also produces signals that are necessary and sufficient for inducing ventrolateral mesoderm and endoderm  in the embryonic margin  <cit> . ysl sufficiency is inferred from the ability of transplanted yolk cells to induce mesoderm gene expression, and ysl necessity is inferred from the loss of mesendoderm gene expression in embryos whose ysl is globally depleted of mrnas. expression of the nodal-related ligands ndr <dig> and ndr <dig> in the ysl account for some - but not all - of this activity  <cit> . because the e-ysl is located directly below the embryonic margin, we hypothesize that genes with key roles in the induction of ventrolateral mesoderm and endoderm are expressed in this domain during early blastula stages.

we sought to identify genes with e-ysl expression. to generate a list of genes with an enhanced probability of e-ysl expression, we used microarrays to compare gene expression levels in blastula-stage whole embryos relative to facs-purified embryonic cells that had been stripped free of the yolk and ysl. we examined the expression of sixty-eight genes enriched in whole embryos, using whole mount in situ hybridization . this revealed a substantial number of genes with e-ysl expression. to our surprise, evl and maternally expressed genes were also enriched by this procedure.

RESULTS
enrichment of ysl, evl and maternal genes by comparative microarray
we hypothesize that the zebrafish e-ysl is a likely source of key signals for inducing ventrolateral mesendoderm. this hypothesis is based on experimental embryology studies and on the e-ysl's proximity to prospective ventrolateral mesendoderm  <cit> . to identify genes expressed in the e-ysl, we prepared crna probes from intact blastula-stage embryos and co-hybridized these with differentially labelled crna probes from embryonic cells that had been disaggregated and facs purified, rendering them free of the yolk . embryonic cells in both groups had been labeled green via embryonic injection of purified kaede protein, facilitating facs of the disaggregated group. this microarray comparison yielded  <dig> unique genes with significantly higher expression levels in whole embryos . we refer to this as the whole vs. green cohort .

as evidence that our strategy had worked, three genes previously reported to have e-ysl expression were significantly enriched by this procedure: mxtx <dig>  mxtx <dig> and hnf4a  <cit> . to identify more such genes, we cloned and performed wish on sixty-eight of the most enriched genes from the whole vs. green cohort. these included twenty-three genes whose expression has not previously been described. we assessed the expression of these sixty-eight genes at four developmental stages: cleavage , sphere , shield  and 80% epiboly . this revealed previously unreported expression for ten genes in the e-ysl . we also observed various other expression patterns , including a high incidence of genes expressed in the evl  and genes expressed during cleavage stages, which we presume to be maternal .

expression of ysl, evl and maternal genes
forty-four of the sixty-eight genes we examined showed expression during cleavage stages  . these mrnas are presumed to be maternal in origin, because only a small fraction of zygotic genes are expressed prior to the midblastula transition at  <dig>  hpf  <cit> . six of these genes showed a maternal-only pattern of expression . no bias in molecular class was seen for these maternal-only genes.

regulation of an evl gene, but not ysl genes, by nodal signaling
we assessed the nodal regulation of several ysl, evl and margin genes identified in this and a previous screen  <cit> . as expected from previous reports, expression of the two margin genes we tested was downregulated in the margin of mzoep mutant embryos, which carry null mutations in an egf-cfc-type receptor that is essential for nodal signaling   <cit> . in the case of sp <dig>  a zinc-finger transcription factor gene, this loss was limited to the dorsal domain . interestingly, the evl gene zgc: <dig>  encoding a keratin, also lost its concentrated expression in the margin of mzoep embryos   <cit> .

consistent with reports for other ysl genes , the ysl expression of hnf4a, gpr137bb and camsap1l <dig> was unchanged in mzoep embryos   <cit> . the gata <dig> gene  <cit>  also showed persistent expression in the ysl, however there was a visible narrowing and sharpening of its expression domain , indicating that like sox <dig>  gata <dig> is expressed in both the margin and ysl, and is lost exclusively from the margin of nodal-deficient embryos.

we also examined nodal regulation of elovl6l, zgc: <dig> and clica, whose expression is excluded from the evl margin at sphere stage . we asked whether exclusion of these genes from the margin might be due to early repression by nascent nodal signals. however we saw no change in the expression of elovl6l, zgc: <dig> or clica in mzoep embryos, indicating that these genes are not repressed by nodal signals .

discussion
identification of genes with e-ysl expression domains
we have implemented a strategy that enriches for genes expressed in the ysl, including the e-ysl. our documentation of previously unrecognized e-ysl expression for ten genes increases the number of candidates for involvement in early ysl functions. with respect to mesendoderm induction, those e-ysl genes  that are expressed at the sphere stage  or earlier are of greater interest, because this is the critical phase for induction  <cit> . our literature and database searches found documentation of e-ysl expression for five additional genes at  <dig> hpf or earlier: apoeb  <cit> , fgf <dig>  <cit> , mxtx <dig> and mxtx <dig>  <cit>  and sox <dig>  <cit> . there is also antisense morpholino-based loss of function evidence that expression of ndr <dig> and ndr <dig> in the early e-ysl accounts for some of the ysl's endoderm-inducing activity  <cit> .

our microarray study was performed on  <dig> hpf embryos, and therefore should also have enriched for e-ysl genes expressed at this stage. a literature and database search extending to  <dig> hpf includes the aforementioned apoeb, fgf <dig>  mxtx <dig>  mxtx <dig> and sox <dig> and adds gata <dig>  <cit> , fbp1b  <cit> , bcl2l <dig>  <cit> , cdh <dig>  <cit> , hhex  <cit> , ndr <dig>  <cit>  and gbx <dig>  <cit>  to the list of genes with e-ysl expression. we re-identified mxtx <dig> and mxtx <dig>  but none of the others . detection of fgf <dig> and fbp1b was not possible for the trivial reason that they are not represented on our microarray. our failure to detect sox <dig>  gata <dig>  ndr <dig>  gbx <dig> and apoeb may be due to the prominent co-expression of these genes by embryonic cells, as reported in  <dig> to  <dig> hpf embryos, which could have prevented their differential detection in the whole vs. green comparison . the remaining three e-ysl genes, bcl2l <dig>  cdh <dig> and hhex, were enriched in our study, but excluded by our statistical cutoff, indicating variability in signal intensity between repeated microarray hybridizations .

a substantial fraction of early e-ysl genes encode transcription factors, including those reported in this study. the blastoderm of drosophila embryos is another early syncytium that is rich in transcription factors. these drosophila transcription factors orchestrate the conversion of gene expression domains from broad gradients to discrete stripes, through gene regulatory networks and trans-nuclear regulation  <cit> . it will be interesting to learn whether analogous patterning mechanisms occur in vertebrate nuclear syncytia, such as the ysl of teleosts or the syncytiotrophoblast of mammalian placentae.

evl and maternal genes
our strategy unexpectedly yielded evl genes and maternal genes. we confirmed that the enrichment for evl genes is statistically significant through the following analysis. we mined a database  that has text terms describing the developmental expression of more than  <dig>  zebrafish genes  <cit> . the term "evl" was associated with  <dig> %  of the  <dig> top enriched genes from the whole vs. green cohort, but only with  <dig> %  of  <dig>  genes tested from across the entire microarray. we determined that this is a significant enrichment , using a z test. we did not find a way to quantify the significance of the apparent maternal gene enrichment. however, our subjective comparison to other expression screens convinces us that  <dig> maternal genes out of  <dig> examined is substantially higher than random  <cit> .

we are not certain why these evl and maternal gene enrichments occurred. however we hypothesize that the evl enrichment arose from an exclusion of evl cells during the facs procedure. this possibility is schematized in figure 1a. regarding maternal genes, perhaps disaggregation and facs caused a downregulation of maternal mrnas that did not occur in whole embryos. alternatively, perhaps maternal mrna is diffusely retained in the yolk without being degraded, and this maternal mrna pool was lost in the facs steps, causing higher levels in whole embryos.

the evl and maternal genes we have described should be of interest for future studies. the animal pole restriction of evl that we observed for elovl6l, zgc: <dig> and clica, and their subsequent expression throughout the evl at shield stage, suggests the existence of an animal-margin progression of evl differentiation. this gradient is opposite to and independent of the nodal-driven margin-animal progression of germ layer differentiation  <cit> . we did not detect any cleavage-stage expression for zgc: <dig> , indicating that this gene's initiation of expression may be concomitant with evl formation. by contrast, both elovl6l and clica display ubiquitous expression at the cleavage stage . this suggests that a rapid decay or redistribution of maternal transcripts for these two genes occurs between the cleavage and sphere stage.

the maternal control of vertebrate embryogenesis is a topic with many open questions, owing to a lack of robust strategies for identifying essential maternal factors. nonetheless, a sufficient number of essential maternal genes have been described to establish that maternal factors have a critical role in vertebrate embryonic development, including fish and mammals  <cit> . one step towards understanding the maternal control of zebrafish embryogenesis will be defining its maternal transcriptome. here we document the maternal expression of thirty-five genes that, to the best of our knowledge, have not previously been reported . we highlight an intriguing pattern of maternal-only expression for six genes that may have roles at the onset of embryogenesis.

nodal regulation of extraembryonic tissues
we found expression of zgc: <dig> in the evl margin to be nodal dependent. the contribution of specialized evl cells to kupffer's vesicle has also been shown to be nodal dependent  <cit> . finally, a regulatory element from the ndr <dig> promoter was shown to drive gfp expression specifically in the evl  <cit> . thus, nodal signals clearly regulate aspects of evl gene expression and behavior.

by contrast, the ysl appears to function independently of nodal signaling. the data we present here increases the number of documented genes with nodal-independent ysl expression from three to seven, with no instances of nodal-dependent ysl expression reported. this is consistent with a recent study showing that a reporter of smad2/smad <dig> dimerization, which is an essential step for nodal signaling, is not activated in the ysl  <cit> . this lack of conventional nodal signaling in the ysl indicates that distinct pathways must be employed to drive expression of genes in the ysl. this restriction should apply to the expression of ndr <dig> and ndr <dig> themselves: although ndr <dig> and ndr <dig> can induce their own transcription in most of the embryo, this is likely not an option in the ysl  <cit> . given that ndr <dig> and ndr <dig> in the ysl account for some of the ysl's mesendoderm-inducing activity, elucidating how they become activated in the ysl is a critical goal.

CONCLUSIONS
our quest for genes expressed in the ysl of early-stage embryos has uncovered e-ysl expression, evl expression and transient maternal expression for a score of genes. several of these genes are excellent candidates for future studies on the early embryonic patterning of zebrafish. our understanding of these early patterning events must take into account evidence from this study and others that gene expression in the ysl is refractory to nodal signaling. the signaling networks present in the ysl and how they pattern the overlying mesoderm and endoderm remain unclear. utilization of anatomical enrichment techniques such as those presented in this study, in combination with the powerful genetics that zebrafish provide should prove fruitful in elucidating these processes.
