BACKGROUND
it is generally accepted that alzheimer’s disease  is caused by extracellular amyloid plaque deposition and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain  <cit> . β-amyloid peptides  are formed by the action of the β-secretase  and γ-secretase enzymes on the amyloid precursor protein   <cit> . bace- <dig> is currently widely accepted as a leading target for the therapeutic treatment of ad  <cit> . the inhibition of bace- <dig> can prevent the cleavage of app to aβ and the formation of amyloid plaques  <cit> .

the search for potent bace- <dig> inhibitors is being pursued actively in many academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies. most of these endeavors include computational studies such as pharmacophore modeling  <cit> , classical quantitative structure-activity relationships   <cit> , docking and virtual screening  <cit>  and molecular dynamics  simulations  <cit> . currently, several hundred bace- <dig> inhibitors have been reported, but most of these inhibitors are peptidomimetics  <cit> . to find novel bace- <dig> inhibitors, a few companies are actively screening against bace- <dig>  a research group from merck has performed in vitro high-throughput screening  and found a single molecule  as a hit from a multi-million compound library  <cit> , whereas astex therapeutics has taken a fragment-based lead generation approach  <cit> . after the virtual screening of a fragment library, a small number of potential structures were soaked with bace- <dig> crystals in anticipation of obtaining a co-crystal with the enzyme. johnson & johnson pharmaceutical r&d also reported a novel cyclic guanidine screening lead; the initial screening lead had an ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm  <cit> . huang et al. performed in silico screening of  <dig>  small chemicals and found  <dig> diacylurea inhibitors that exhibited an ic <dig> value lower than  <dig> μm in an enzymatic assay. four of these inhibitors were cell penetrant   <cit> .

3d-qsar studies are very helpful in the design of novel lead compounds. zuo et al. explored the binding mechanism of  <dig> statine-based peptidomimetic inhibitors of bace- <dig> using comfa  and comsia  methods. based on molecular docking results, 3d-qsar models were developed with q <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  using comfa and comsia, respectively  <cit> . a study of the mechanism of the interaction between bace- <dig> and its inhibitors would be valuable in discovering more active drug-like inhibitors that block the function of bace- <dig>  to glean critical information regarding the interactions of the inhibitors with the residues in the active site of bace- <dig>  we conducted a 3d-qsar study of  <dig> bace-1/inhibitor complexes using the comparative binding energy  method. the combine method, first developed by a. r. ortiz in  <dig>  <cit> , has been widely applied in the field of drug design  <cit> . in  <dig>  gil-redondo et al. developed gcombine  <cit> , a java graphical user interface , to perform combine analyses, providing a convenient tool for academic researchers. the key idea of combine analysis is that a simple expression describing the differences in binding affinity of a series of related ligand-receptor complexes can be derived by using multivariate statistics to correlate experimental data on binding affinities with components of the ligand-receptor interaction energy computed from energy-minimized 3d structures. some other forms of free energy calculations, such as mm-pbsa, mm-gbsa  <cit> , or linear interaction energy  simulation  <cit> , use monte carlo, or molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the protein-ligand interaction energies. however, combine analysis only needs static structures and this approach can reduce the computational burden. compared with the classical 3d-qsar methods   <cit> , combine analysis can aid researchers in acquiring quantitative or semiquantitative insight into the key role played by specific protein-ligand interactions and/or desolvation components. as a result, residue-based van der waals and electrostatic contributions that are endowed with a higher discriminatory ability can be identified, which provides clues for further chemical modification throughout the series. it has also been demonstrated that regression models derived with combine analysis are suitable for fast virtual screening of compound databases  <cit> .

alignment is a crucial component in 3d-qsar studies, and many researchers have used docking methods to align ligands when 3d protein structures were available  <cit> . however, due to various approximations and trade-offs involved in the formulations because of the computational cost, the current scoring functions are unable to accurately assess the ligand binding poses. to overcome this disadvantage of the dock methods, in the present study, we replaced the docking method with a superimposing x-ray protein/inhibitor complex method to align the ligands. it has been eleven years since the first bace- <dig> crystal structure was reported. currently, there are more than  <dig> x-ray crystal structures of bace-1/inhibitor complexes in the brookhaven protein data bank   <cit> . taking into consideration the diversity of the inhibitors, we chose  <dig> crystal structures of bace-1/inhibitor complexes from the brookhaven pdb. using a combine analysis, we obtained a robust combine model, which should be useful for understanding the inhibitory mode of bace- <dig> and in designing novel lead compounds against alzheimer’s disease.

RESULTS
in this study, choosing the  <dig> w <dig> structure as the reference for all the alignments was based on previous research  <cit> . polgar and keseru have performed a comparative virtual screen for bace- <dig> inhibitors using different protein conformations . in that study, the use of  <dig> w <dig> as a target gave the best enrichment factors and the ligands found proper poses more easily  <cit> . furthermore, in our previous studies, by comparing different reference structures, we found that the use of the  <dig> w <dig> structure gave better binding affinity models  <cit> . therefore, despite the availability of other crystal structures of bace- <dig> serving as the reference structure, we concluded that the  <dig> w <dig> structure represented the most suitable reference structure.

by a standard superposition technique  <cit> , we analyzed and compared  <dig> crystal structures to explore the protonation state of the catalytic asp residues, and to clarify the functional role and stability of the two conserved water molecules  in the bace- <dig> active site . the catalytic water  bridges the two catalytic aspartate residues and is involved in nucleophilic attack. structural data suggest the average distance between the carboxyl oxygens of the catalytic asp dyad is  <dig> – <dig>  Å for all  <dig> complexes , it indicates that hydrogen bonding between asp <dig> and asp <dig> is possible in the presence of a substrate. the location of the thr <dig> hydroxyl group at a hydrogen bond distance from the asp  <dig> carboxyl is a common feature of the bace- <dig> complexes with inhibitors. this phenomenon was supported by the reaction mechanism proposed by andreeva and rumsh, i.e., thr <dig> protects the asp <dig> carboxyl from protonation  <cit> .

at the same time, the proximity of the ser <dig> hydroxyl group to the asp <dig> carboxyl group found in bace- <dig> was observed in all complexes with inhibitors. it is important to note that another water molecule , in the vicinity of the active groups, is completely conserved  <cit> . this water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with side-chain hydroxyl of ser <dig> and this kind of interaction was observed in all analyzed structures. besides ser <dig>  w <dig> is oriented such that it acts as a donor to the asn <dig> backbone carbonyl. this bond is also conserved. w <dig> also forms a third hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of the conserved residue tyr71; the tyr <dig> hydroxyl acts as an acceptor for the nh of trp <dig>  these interactions form a continuous chain of hydrogen-bonded residues, trp76-tyr71-w2-ser35-asp <dig>  thereby connecting the flap with the catalytic site. structural data suggest the existence of a mechanism that assists releasing a proton from the asp <dig> carboxyl during the initial stages of catalysis, and acceptance of a proton after substrate cleavage. this mechanism arises from the ability of the ser <dig> hydroxyl and the water molecule w <dig> to exchange their donor and acceptor roles while being hydrogen-bonded. in other word, ser <dig> assists in proton acceptance and release of asp <dig> during the catalytic cycle.

the identification of the protonation states of the key aspartate residues in bace- <dig> is of significant interest both in understanding the reaction mechanism and in guiding the design of drugs against alzheimer’s disease. however, researchers have not reached consensus on the experimental and theoretical studies of the aspartate protonation states  <cit> . by structural data analysis, our results are consistent with the results of polgar and keseru  <cit> . polgar and keseru performed pka calculations to study the protonation state of catalytic asp residues  of bace- <dig> based on the finite-difference solution of the poisson-boltzmann equation. their research concluded that crystals of bace- <dig>  were grown at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  and under this condition only the asp <dig> residue is ionized .

in addition, tautomerism could influence the results of the combine analysis. tautomerism, which is a phenomenon whereby a compound interconverts to other isomers that differ in the position of a double bond and one atom , is of special interest in studies of protein-ligand interactions  <cit> . since the displacement of a hydrogen atom may convert an acceptor into a donor, a tautomeric rearrangement changes the interaction landscape of a protein-ligand complex. in this study, we should initially examine whether there are tautomers among these  <dig> co-crystallized ligands. next, we had to estimate the preferred tautomer in the binding site for each tautomer by analyzing the hydrogen bond interactions. this is because the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the pdb structures were not determined due to the resolution limits of the structures. by visual inspection, some tautomeric structures among these  <dig> co-crystallized ligands were found and the main tautomeric forms can be represented as amide-imidic acid and allyl amine-imine. by analyzing the structural data, the most favorable hydrogen bond interactions were identified. table  <dig> summarizes the most preferred tautomer in the binding site for each compound. moreover, according to the above analysis the protonation state of bace- <dig> was assessed as asp32+ and asp228−. therefore, this protonation state  and the most preferred tautomer of each co-crystallized inhibitor were applied in the following combine analysis.

in present study, three types of electrostatic models  were used. the q <dig> value served as the criterion to determine the optimal dimensionality of the pls models. the standard deviation of errors of correlation  value for the  <dig> internal training sets and the average standard deviation of errors of prediction  value for the eight external test sets are listed in table  <dig>  to justify the docked conformation of the inhibitors from their respective complexes, root-mean-square deviation  was used as a good measure to evaluate the predicted power of a docking result it is generally accepted that a successful docking result reproduces the crystallographic conformation of a ligand in the complex structure within a  <dig> Å rmsd on all ligand atoms. three protocols were performed to translocate the other  <dig> co-crystallized inhibitors to a single active pocket of bace- <dig> . protocol  <dig>  energy minimization after protein superposition; protocol 2: energy minimization before protein superposition; protocol 3: docking by surflex. subsequently, we performed a combine analysis of the  <dig> bace-1/inhibitor complexes . as indicated in table  <dig> and judging from the rmsd value, protocol  <dig> reproduced the native crystallographic conformation to its fullest extent. as indicated in table  <dig>  among the three types of electrostatic models, we found that model  <dig> outperformed models  <dig> and  <dig>  in which three latent variables  yielded an r <dig> of  <dig> , a q <dig> of  <dig> , and an sdec value of  <dig> . the sdep value for the external validation was  <dig> , as expected, which is larger than that for the internal validation but sufficient to demonstrate the robustness of the model. the predicted pic <dig> values are listed in table  <dig>  and plotted against the experimental pic <dig> values for the model with three latent variables in figure 2a. we can see that this 3-pc combine model produces more accurate predictions than those obtained in previous comfa and comsia studies of bace- <dig> inhibitors  <cit> .

it is worthwhile to note that a ligand docked within  <dig> Å of the crystallographic pose can give rise to interactions with active site residues that are different from those found in the original x-ray crystal structures. therefore, we performed a similar combine analysis using the complexes present in the pdb and subjecting these complexes to a similar energy refinement mentioned above. in order to ensure the feasibility of performing the combine analysis, the  <dig> w <dig> structure was set as the reference structure and all crystal structures were superimposed using the cα atoms. in cases where the number of amino acids differed between complexes, we normalized all the crystal structures using a common number of residues. as indicated in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the 4-pc or 5-pc combine models generated from the complexes present in the pdb, was superior to the models built from the three protocols we used, regardless of which type of electrostatic model was applied. table  <dig> shows that the 5-pc sigmoidal electrostatic model was the best, which yielded an r <dig> of  <dig> , a q <dig> of  <dig>  and an sdec value of  <dig> . the sdep value for the external validation was  <dig> . the predicted pic <dig> values are presented in table  <dig> and plotted against the experimental pic <dig> values for the model with five latent variables in figure 2b.

we are not surprised by the above results. a possible reason for these observations is that the application of the actual protein crystals was always considered to be more reliable than the artificial docking method. in addition, when building the combine models with actual protein crystals, consideration for the effects of two or three water molecules in the catalytic site did improve the accuracy of the predictions. in comparison to the approach used, e.g., the combine model built from a single x-ray crystal structure , the method using the actual complexes in the pdb was similar to the flexible docking approach, in which the effects of side-chains of several residues were considered.

as depicted in figure 2a and b, both the 3-pc model  and 5-pc model  behaved well for most of the compounds, however, the 1tqf ligand  was always determined to be an outlier in the combine analysis, whether or not it was refined before being placed into the binding pocket of 1w <dig>  or built from the actual complexes present in the pdb. even when the water molecules in the catalytic site were taken into consideration, the 1tqf ligand was always an outlier, which differed by more than one order of magnitude between the predicted and experimental results. the primary reason was the different binding mode of the 1tqf ligand when compared with the binding modes of the other  <dig> ligands. in examining the enzyme-inhibitor complex , the s <dig> to s <dig> subsites were found to be occupied by the inhibitor, and we did not observe any direct contact between the inhibitor and the catalytic aspartic dyad, asp <dig> and asp <dig>  instead, the inhibitor’s oxyacetamide nh moiety forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule situated between the catalytic aspartic acids. additionally, regarding the stereochemistry of the r-methyl-benzamide ligand, the structure reveals the presence of a novel s <dig> sub-pocket that binds the p-fluorophenyl ring.

to investigate the distribution of the  <dig> complexes  in the space defined by their ligand-receptor interaction energies, a principal component analysis  was performed on the pretreated variables. as mentioned above, because there are  <dig> amino acids in the protein, and two energy contributions  were considered for each residue, an x matrix was built with  <dig> columns, representing each of these energy terms, and  <dig> rows representing each inhibitor in the series. a final column containing inhibitory activities is then added to the matrix. the x matrix was then transformed so that each column of data had an average of zero and a standard deviation of one. after removing those variables with a standard deviation below  <dig>  kcal/mol,  <dig> residues were retained for the combine interaction energy calculation, and  <dig> variables were selected to build the final pls model. the dimensionality of the data matrix was reduced using a pca method, while keeping the amount of information loss to a minimum. the number of latent variables  chosen for the model was that yielding the best cross-validated performance. the coefficients in a given pc provide information on the relative weight of the different terms and can be used to deduce the relevance of each individual ligand-residue interaction to explain the variance in activity.

from the point of view of statistical research, the first principal component  accounts for the maximum variance  in the original dataset. the second principal component  is orthogonal  to the first one, and it accounts for most of the remaining variance. this procedure is continued until the total variance is accounted for. the combine analysis aims to tackle the x matrix with pca analysis, and then use a multiple linear regression method to build a pls model  <cit> . the q <dig> is a well-known indicator for evaluating the function of the number of principal components  extracted. although using the 5-pc model  for predicating the activity of the inhibitors gave a higher accuracy , among all the 3-pc models, the distance-dependent dielectric constant 3-pc model  was the top one, with a q <dig> value of  <dig> . selection of a smaller number of latent variables  chosen for the combine model was more beneficial and simpler for the following research on identifying the nature of the interactions between the ligand and receptor. such information is considered to be the most important factor that guides drug design. therefore, in the next part of the discussion, we will focus on results calculated from the 3-pc model .

the essential data patterns can be easily visualized by plotting the complexes in the space defined by the first and second pcs , and the score plot of the first two principal components  is shown in figure  <dig>  alternatively, the relationship between the original variables and the new orthogonal latent variables can be revealed by plotting the contributions of the calculated energy descriptors to each of these pcs , and the loading plots are shown in figure  <dig> 

as can be seen in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the first pc extracted, which consists primarily of the van der waals contributions involving tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  thr <dig> and gln <dig> and the electrostatic contributions from arg <dig>  arg <dig> and lys <dig>  is sufficient to classify  <dig> inhibitors  into two groups. one group was primarily composed of aminopyridine analogues, which are characterized by low affinity and low molecular weights, whereas the other group was mainly composed of high-molecular-weight compounds, including some peptidomimetic inhibitors. the second pc, with major contributions from the van der waals interactions involving thr <dig>  gln <dig> and thr <dig> and the electrostatic contributions involving arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig> and lys <dig>  is also able to distinguish the  <dig> inhibitors of the training set into two groups, similar to the first pc. in addition to the two groups mentioned above, there are some outliers scattered in the lower right portion of the quadrant in the score plot , such as the eight-residue transition-state inhibitors  <dig> and  <dig> , which fill all eight binding subsites .

the most powerful variable in the first pc is the van der waals interaction energy of tyr <dig>  a favorable interaction with tyr <dig> is observed for inhibitors  <dig> and  <dig> , whereas unfavorable interactions are observed with the aminopyridine analogues in the first principal component. this observation can be explained as follows: tyr <dig> is a flap residue that occupies the s <dig> pocket. when analyzed by the x-ray complexes, the flap loop was observed to be in an open conformation when bace- <dig> bound to the low molecular weight aminopyridine analogues. this conformation results in weak van der waals interactions between the inhibitors and tyr <dig>  however, when bound to high-molecular-weight inhibitors such as om99- <dig> and om00- <dig>  the flap loop was in a closed conformation, which indicates that strong van der waals interactions occurred between the inhibitors and tyr <dig>  note that tyr <dig> is involved in a chain of hydrogen bonds with several residues in the binding pocket  <cit> , thus fixing the flap in a closed conformation upon binding of a high-affinity inhibitor.

it is apparent from the combine analysis that only a limited number of interactions have a strong influence for most of the binding differences observed among the bace- <dig> inhibitors. although bace- <dig> contains  <dig> amino acid residues, a large portion of these residues were not considered in the combine analysis. the normalized pls coefficients can quantitatively and rapidly help us to understand the different ligand-residue interactions that result in different activities . according to eq  <dig>  the pic <dig> values are mainly determined by the large pls coefficients, wi, and the large interaction energies, ui. the normalized pls regression coefficients in the first three latent variables  are shown in figure  <dig>  and the pls regression coefficients can be color-coded and displayed on a surface representation of the protein, as shown in figure  <dig>  in addition, figure  <dig> indicates the main interactions of compound  <dig> with the bace- <dig> “key” amino acid residues named in this work. in order to investigate the rmsd between the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ conformations of bace- <dig>  based on main chain conformations, the  <dig> ligand-bound x-ray structures could be formed four distinct clusters. from which, 1w <dig>  1fkn, 2ohl, and 2ohs were chosen and superimposed together .

we used a threshold of  <dig>  on the pls coefficients to extract important van der waals variables with large pls coefficients and a threshold of  <dig>  on the pls coefficients for the important electrostatic variables. with respect to the van der waals block, it can be seen in figure 5a that there are negative pls coefficients for gly <dig>  gln <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  gln <dig>  ile <dig>  tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  thr <dig> and asn <dig>  indicating that favorable van de waals interactions with these residues are beneficial for activity. these residues form hydrophobic pockets  to accommodate the substituents of the inhibitors. of all of these ligand interactions, thr <dig> appears to be the most discriminatory for activity. as mentioned above, after the x-ray complexes were superimposed, some differences emerged in the side-chain conformations of thr <dig>  thr <dig> and gln <dig>  which indicates that these residues can move and rotate, with the most notable movement occurring for gln <dig>  to better accommodate the inhibitors. additionally, some expected flexibility was also observed in various residues lining the binding site cleft such as arg <dig>  arg <dig> and arg <dig> 

ile <dig> and gly <dig> are situated in the s <dig> subpocket . the s <dig> and s <dig> pockets  are contiguous in bace- <dig>  and the s <dig> pocket is rather hydrophobic in nature. many inhibitors formed favorable contacts at this site in the s <dig> pocket, and this location was considered to be a useful area to target in drug design. the extension of this pocket primarily depends on the conformation of the 10s loop. from the comparative analysis of the bace- <dig> x-ray structures, it is clear that the 10s loop, a short loop located at the base of the s <dig> sp, displays two primary low-energy conformations: an open conformation  and a closed conformation .

tyr <dig> is located in the hydrophobic s2’ pocket  and the hydrophobic s1’ pocket . we found that the p2’ moiety of some inhibitors entirely fills the s2’ pocket with a benzyl ring. because of its limited dimensions, the hydrophobic s1’ pocket only appears to tolerate an alkyl or cycloalkyl chain with a maximum of three carbon atoms. this position was employed to achieve selective bace inhibition and should be investigated further.

it is worth noting that tyr <dig> has a small negative pls coefficient, highlighting the fact that the van der waals interactions with this residue are slightly correlated with activity. however, in the first principal component, this residue is the most important van der waals interaction energy variable. the pls analysis seeks variables that can provide effective discrimination between weak and tight binders, and these variables do not need to be those with the greater absolute values, meaning that differences in the van der waals interaction energies involving tyr <dig> cannot be used in the chemometric method for the purposes of correlation with differences in inhibitory potency. thus, this interaction, although important for binding, undoubtedly constitutes a relatively small contribution to the inhibitory activity.

in terms of the electrostatic block, it can be seen in figure 5b that the negative pls coefficients for arg <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and ser <dig> co-existed with the positive pls coefficients for asp <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  tyr <dig> and lys <dig>  indicating that favorable electrostatic interactions with these residues are beneficial for activity.

as depicted in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  asn <dig>  arg <dig> and ser <dig>  which are located in the s <dig> open region, can be either hydrophobic or polar. it was found that a sulfonamide or a hydrophobic phenyl ring of the inhibitors can interact with these surrounding residues, suggesting that more negative or more hydrophobic substituents are favorable in this region to improve the inhibitory activity. for the positively charged arg <dig> residue, located in the s2’ pocket, inhibitors including one or more acidic groups on the p2’ branch are expected to favor the interaction with bace- <dig>  most inhibitors donate a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of gly <dig>  which is located on the edge of the s <dig> pocket as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  upon comparing the binding modes of the aligned inhibitors, we noticed that hydrogen bonds with the backbones of gly <dig>  thr <dig>  or gln <dig> are frequently present, and this interaction appears to be vital for high bace- <dig> inhibitory activity. the aforementioned s <dig> sp, thr <dig> and arg <dig> are additional points of ligand attachment, which have negative pls coefficients. compounds presenting a polar interaction with side-chains of these residues can strengthen the inhibitor binding.

alternatively, in the catalytic region, which was assigned by the pls model to an electrostatic interaction, the catalytic residues  are assigned positive coefficients. this result means that a positive value for the electrostatic interaction energy of the inhibitor with these two particular amino acids will favor binding, suggesting that the inhibitor with a more positive substituent in the catalytic region would increase the inhibitory potency. in the  <dig> x-ray protein/ligand complexes, all of the inhibitors except 32p  formed a hydrogen bond with asp <dig> or asp <dig> 

the abovementioned tyr <dig> residue, with a hydroxyl group, is assigned a positive coefficient. thus, the positive substituents of the inhibitors should strengthen the binding of these inhibitors. gly <dig>  with a backbone carbonyl, and thr <dig>  with a hydroxyl group, are assigned positive coefficients. the positive substituents of the inhibitors should strengthen the binding of these inhibitors. the region  between the s <dig> and s1’ pockets also results in positive coefficients, suggesting that this is another area where more positively charged substituents of the inhibitors can interact.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we report an application of one of the newer 3d qsar methods developed by a. r. ortiz  <cit> . comparative binding energy   <cit>  to a data set of  <dig> x-ray co-crystallized inhibitors of bace- <dig>  based on the binding conformations obtained by superimposing  <dig> x-ray protein/ligand complexes, two predictive and robust combine models were developed by correlating the pic <dig> values with the van der waals and electrostatic interactions that exist between the inhibitors and each protein residue. the reliability of the models was verified by the inhibitors in the testing set. the two models develop were  a 3-pc distance-dependent dielectric constant model  with a q <dig> value of  <dig>  and an sdec value of  <dig> ; and  a 5-pc sigmoidal electrostatic model  with a q <dig> value of  <dig>  and an sdec value of  <dig> .

the conventional 3d-qsar approaches, such as comfa and comsia  <cit> , are limited because their prediction functions rely solely on the physico-chemical parameters of substituents in a congeneric series of compounds or on molecular interaction fields calculated at discrete points in a three-dimensional  lattice. moreover, they cannot provide information concerning protein-ligand interactions. the combine method used in the present study can offer detailed information describing the protein-ligand interactions and serve as a qsar model to assess the activity of the compounds. in our 3-pc combine model, the differences in the inhibitory activity of the set of inhibitors are primarily due to the van der waals interactions with tyr <dig>  gln <dig>  ile <dig>  tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  thr <dig> and asn <dig> and the electrostatic interactions with asp <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  arg <dig>  tyr <dig>  gly <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig> and ser <dig>  thus, a total of  <dig> active-site residues of the receptor may be vital for ligand binding. accordingly, strong inhibitors should have structural features that participate in favorable interactions with these protein residues. these residues are important for fine-tuning the inhibitory potency.

in our study, we did not investigate the electrostatic desolvation effects computed with a poisson-boltzmann model, which has been proven to yield improved combine models in several previous studies  <cit> . nevertheless, our combine models provided useful insights that can be used to design novel bace- <dig> inhibitors for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease.
