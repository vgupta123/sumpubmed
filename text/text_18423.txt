BACKGROUND
the advent of next generation high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the analysis of genomes and transcriptomes  <cit> . when applied to the transcriptome, this methodology is referred to as rna-seq . rna-seq has been used for gene annotation, expression analysis and snp discovery  <cit> . this methodology has also proven useful for discovery of novel transcripts  and identification of alternative splice variants  <cit> . it is expected that rna-seq methodologies will supersede microarrays for transcript profiling because of higher sensitivity, base-pair resolution and the larger range of expression values that can be detected  <cit> . furthermore, in contrast to microarrays, rna-seq does not require prior knowledge of gene sequences. however, rna-seq presents bioinformatic challenges because of the required assembly of millions of short sequence reads that are generated by the methodology.

rna-seq has been successfully used for annotation, transcript profiling and/or snp discovery in a number of plant species. for model plant species with sequenced genomes, sequence reads can be mapped to the reference genome. the model species where rna-seq analysis has been applied include arabidopsis  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and medicago truncatula  <cit> . there are also examples of the application of rna-seq to non-model plant species that lack a reference genome. in the absence of a reference genome, de novo assembly of sequence reads into contigs is required. rna-seq has been used for transcript profiling in eucalyptus grandis  <cit> , grape   <cit> , california poppy   <cit> , avocado   <cit> , pachycladon enysii  <cit>  and artemisia annua  <cit> . in eucalyptus grandis and rape , rna-seq was used for snp discovery  <cit> .

alfalfa is the most widely cultivated forage legume in the world and the fourth most widely grown crop in the us  <cit> . in addition to its value as a livestock feed, alfalfa also has potential as a cellulosic ethanol feedstock  <cit> . alfalfa is an allogamous autotetraploid with complex polysomic inheritance  <cit> . slow progress has been made in improving the agronomic traits of this species using traditional breeding approaches based on phenotypic selection. for the most part, genomic approaches for crop improvement  have not been applied to this legume because of limited genomic resources. as of february  <dig>  there were  <dig>  alfalfa ests available in the public database. a few ssrs have been detected but snps have not yet been identified  <cit> . recently, we reported on the results of transcript profiling and single feature polymorphism  detection in alfalfa using the medicago genechip as a cross-species platform  <cit> . the medicago genechip contains probe sets designed for the model plant, medicago truncatula, a diploid relative of alfalfa. using a method based on probe affinity differences and affinity shape power, we identified over  <dig> s sfps in the stem internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> that differed in cellulose and lignin concentrations in cell walls  <cit> . in a subsequent study using the medicago genechip for transcript profiling of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  interspecies variable regions and sfps were masked prior to data analysis resulting in a 2-fold increase in the number of differentially expressed genes detected in stem internodes of the two genotypes  <cit> . although the research of yang et al.  <cit>  significantly advanced alfalfa genomics, the use of a cross-species platform for microarray analysis limits the sensitivity and specificity of transcriptome analysis and polymorphism detection.

the stem tissue of alfalfa is important in determining the value of this forage as a livestock feed and cellulosic feedstock. increasing the cellulose and decreasing the lignin content in cell walls in stems would improve alfalfa for both uses. in this study, we applied rna-seq to gene identification, polymorphism detection and transcript profiling of two alfalfa clonal lines  that differ in cell wall composition in stems. the results were used to assemble the first gene atlas for alfalfa . our research also provides the first report of high-throughput snp detection and digital gene expression analysis in the alfalfa transcriptome.

RESULTS
cell wall composition of stems of genotypes  <dig> and 773
the alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> used in this study were selected for divergent cell wall composition in stems under field conditions . cell wall composition of greenhouse grown stems used for rna sampling in the current study is shown in table  <dig>  cell wall concentration in stems of the two clones did not differ. in contrast, cellulose content  in the stems of genotype  <dig> was  <dig> % greater compared to genotype  <dig>  . in addition, galactose and mannose concentrations were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  greater, respectively, in stems of genotype  <dig> compared to genotype  <dig> . klason lignin concentration in the cell wall was  <dig> % greater in stems of  <dig> compared to stems of  <dig>  . these genotypes consistently displayed differences in cell wall cellulose and lignin content in stems when plants were grown under different field environments  and in the greenhouse .

values are least square means based on an analysis of variance with three biological replicates for each clone arranged in a randomized complete block design . sem = standard error of mean, ns = non-significant .

rna-seq using the illumina ga-ii platform
for rna-seq analysis, we developed a total of four cdna libraries derived from elongating stem  and post-elongation stem  internodes of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> . in alfalfa stems, genes associated with primary cell wall development are preferentially expressed in es internodes while genes associated with secondary xylem development are enriched in pes internodes  <cit> . for sequencing by synthesis using the illumina ga-ii platform, cdna libraries 708es, 708pes and 773es were run on two lanes per library while the 773pes library was run on one lane. a total of  <dig> , <dig> est reads were generated by a single run of  <dig> cycles. after filtering low quality reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads  were selected for further analysis . the illumina reads generated in this study are available at the ncbi sra browser  into a total of  <dig>  unique sequences with an average length of  <dig> bp . the velvet algorithm has also been used successfully for de novo transcriptome assembly in previous studies  <cit> . the velvet algorithm was originally developed for de novo assembly of genome sequences where the coverage is expected to be homogeneous throughout the genome. however, the coverage of transcripts is highly heterogeneous due to difference in gene expression. previous studies showed that de novo assembly using the velvet program with longer k-mers results in a more contiguous transcript assembly but lower transcript diversity compared to shorter k-mers  <cit> . although several recent studies introduced new algorithms and methodologies developed for de novo transcriptome assembly  <cit> , a consensus standard protocol has not yet emerged for de novo transcriptome assembly. in this study, we optimized our velvet de novo transcriptome assembly to favor transcript contiguity with high specificity as opposed to increased transcript diversity . to complement the limitation of the high k-mer that we selected for the velvet assembly in this study , we generated additional ests using the gs flx titanium platform.

rna-seq using the gs flx titanium platform
we generated a total of  <dig>  additional ests  using the gs flx titanium platform http://www. <dig> com. the additional est sequences were generated from the cdna libraries derived from es  and pes  internodes of the genotype  <dig>  the additional ests obtained using the gs flx titanium platform increased the diversity of transcripts discovered and hence provided broader coverage of the alfalfa transcriptome than would have been achieved based on the de novo assembly of the illumina reads alone. the additional ests are also available at the ncbi sra browser 
we used the gene index assembly protocol  <cit>  for reference transcriptome assembly in alfalfa. this protocol has been used for over a decade to build unigene assemblies for numerous species of animals, plants and microorganisms http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/plant.html. however, no gene index is currently available for alfalfa. in this study, the first alfalfa  gene index  was built by combining the de novo assembled illumina reads using the velvet program , the  <dig>  ests obtained using the gs flx titanium platform, and  <dig>  sanger ests for alfalfa available in the public database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov following the gene index assembly protocol previously described  <cit> .

msgi  <dig>  contains a total of  <dig>  unique sequences including  <dig>  tentative consensus sequences ,  <dig>  singletons and  <dig>  pseudo-singletons . pseudo-singletons refer to the de novo assembled illumina sequences that were not assembled into contigs during the gene index assembly process. the average length of the unique sequences in msgi  <dig>  is  <dig> bp. unique sequence lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with more than  <dig>  sequences larger than  <dig> bp. the total base count of the sequences in msgi  <dig>  is  <dig> , <dig> bp. the newly built alfalfa gene index increases the number of alfalfa sequences publicly available by about 10-fold.

gene annotation and functional classification
we assigned putative functions for the unique sequences in msgi  <dig>  by conducting blastx searches against the non-redundant  protein database  . putative functions could be assigned for about 83% of the sequences. we also assigned gene ontology  functional classes and mapman functional classifications  <cit>  to the unique sequences in msgi  <dig>   . to examine whether bias occurs among the functional classes represented in msgi  <dig> , we compared the percentages of each go functional class and pathway in msgi  <dig>  with the percentages found in the m.  truncatula gene index , the m. truncatula coding sequences  and the arabidopsis coding sequences  . although most of the sequences in msgi  <dig>  were derived from stem tissues, similar levels of representation of most functional classes were found in msgi  <dig>  and the other databases . these results suggest that msgi  <dig>  can serve as a reference sequence database for genomic analysis in alfalfa.

ssr detection
we detected simple sequence repeats  among sequences in msgi  <dig>  using the misa program  <cit>  . a total of  <dig>  ssrs were identified among  <dig>  sequences which represents about  <dig> % of the total unique sequences in msgi  <dig>  . the estimated frequency of ssrs among the expressed sequences was one ssr per  <dig> kb. ssr detection frequency is dependent on the ssr detection parameter  <cit> . the ssr frequency measured in this study is significantly lower than that detected in other species  where the same ssr detection parameter was used  <cit> . the significantly reduced ssr detection frequency found in msgi  <dig>  sequences may be due to the reduced detection efficiency of short length sequences . alternatively, the ssr frequency among expressed sequences may be lower in alfalfa compared to other species. ssrs with mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats composed about  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the ssrs in msgi  <dig> , respectively. using the default parameter of the primer <dig> program  <cit> , we designed ssr primers spanning a total of  <dig> ssrs .

snp detection
to identify snps between alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  illumina est reads from es and pes internode libraries were combined for each genotype. the combined es and pes reads for each genotype were independently aligned to the msgi  <dig>  sequences using the maq program  <cit> . from the alignment output of each genotype, we summarized the depth  of each nucleotide  at each base position in each reference sequence. next, to reduce the identification of false positive snps, we filtered potential snps using a stringent nucleotide depth cutoff of  <dig>  for each genotype . using this protocol, we identified  <dig>  snps between genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig>  sequences in msgi  <dig>  . about 74% of these sequences contained a single snp while about  <dig> % contained  <dig> or more snps.

to validate the snps that were predicted using the rna-seq data generated in this study, we randomly selected  <dig> snps. genomic dnas purified from genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were genotyped by maldi-tof mass spectrometry using the iplex gold spectrometry system http://www.sequenom.com. out of  <dig> snps tested,  <dig>  were polymorphic between the two genotypes . in addition to genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  we also genotyped  <dig> additional alfalfa  genotypes selected from different populations of m. sativa ssp. sativa or m. sativa ssp. falcata. the  <dig> validated snps between  <dig> and  <dig> also showed polymorphism among the other medicago genotypes tested . this suggests that the snps predicted in this study can also be used for genotyping in other alfalfa genotypes.

in a previous study that described single-feature polymorphism  discovery in alfalfa using the medicago genechip as a cross-species platform  <cit> , we proposed candidate gene-based association mapping for selecting alfalfa germplasm with modified cell wall composition in stems. in this study, snps were also identified in genes with various functional classes including numerous cell wall-related genes . for example, snps were identified in  <dig> genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis including  <dig> cellulose synthase and three cobra genes  <cit>  . in addition, snps were identified in  <dig> lignin pathway genes,  <dig> genes involved in cell wall precursor pathways  and in numerous regulatory genes including various transcription factor families, signalling genes and hormone genes .

to detect functional classes over- or under-represented among the snp-harboring genes, we performed fisher's exact test with bonferroni correction  as previously described  <cit>  . the functional classes over-represented among snp-harboring genes included photosynthesis, cell wall, amino acid metabolism, stress response , nodulin-like, protein synthesis and wrky transcription factor classes . the snps developed in this study can be used for either candidate gene-based or whole genome scanning association mapping studies to identify snps associated with cell wall traits in alfalfa stems. with further development, the snps identified in this study may prove to be useful in molecular breeding programs focused on improving alfalfa as a forage crop and biomass feedstock via marker-assisted selection.

in this study, we also identified allelic variations  within genotypes. using a minimum snp depth cutoff of  <dig>  we detected  <dig>  and  <dig>  allelic variations  within genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . these snps within genotype were detected in  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences for genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. detection of allelic variations  within genotypes is equally important as detecting snps between genotypes for understanding phenotypic differences  and for future applications such as marker-assisted selection.

comparison of msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds as reference sequences for digital transcript profiling
the alfalfa gene index  developed in this study provides a reference sequence database that can be used for digital gene expression analysis in alfalfa. however, another option for rna-seq analysis in alfalfa is to use mt <dig>  cds as a reference sequence because m. truncatula and alfalfa share significant coding sequence homology  <cit> . furthermore, sequences in mt <dig>  cds are full-length sequences  with better coverage than sequences in msgi  <dig>  where the majority are partial sequences. as an initial step to evaluate the utility of msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds as reference sequences for transcript profiling of alfalfa, the illumina est reads generated in this study were mapped to msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds sequences using the bowtie program  <cit>  . on average, about 70% of the est reads in each library  could be mapped to the msgi  <dig>  sequences. in contrast, only about 30% of the est reads could be mapped to the mt <dig>  cds sequences . we measured the raw digital expression counts for each gene by quantifying the number of est reads that were mapped to each reference sequence. the raw digital gene expression counts were normalized using the rpkm  method  <cit>  to correct the digital gene expression counts for bias caused by reference sequence size and total est numbers per library .

further evaluation of msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds as reference sequence databases for alfalfa was conducted by comparing rna-seq data with the previously generated genechip data for the same stem tissues but in different alfalfa genotypes  <cit>  . the rna-seq data generated using msgi  <dig>  or mt <dig>  cds showed a linear relationship with genechip data with similar pearson correlation coefficients  . a total of  <dig>  genes were commonly-selected between rna-seq and genechip data when msgi  <dig>  was used as reference sequences . however, when mt <dig>  cds was used as reference sequences, the number of genes commonly-selected between rna-seq and genechip data decreased to  <dig> reflecting a significant decrease in detection sensitivity . this is not surprising because, as described above, only about 30% of the est reads could be mapped to the mt <dig>  cds while about 70% of the est reads could be mapped to the msgi  <dig>  .

as a final evaluation of msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds as reference sequences for digital gene expression analysis in alfalfa, we compared the digital gene expression data generated using msgi  <dig>  and mt <dig>  cds sequences with real -time quantitative rt-pcr  data obtained from  <dig> genes   . previous studies showed a linear relationship between ΔΔct values from qrt-pcr and the log gene expression ratio obtained in microarray analysis  <cit> . we plotted ΔΔct values obtained from the qrt-pcr data for randomly selected genes against log <dig> values from the rna-seq data with msgi  <dig>  or mt <dig>  cds as reference sequences. the results showed a linear relationship between qrt-pcr data and the rna-seq data using both reference sequences. however, using msgi  <dig>  increased the pearson correlation coefficient  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . next, we plotted ΔΔct values obtained from the qrt-pcr data for selected cell wall genes against log <dig> values from the rna-seq data. using msgi  <dig>  as the reference sequence database also increased the pearson correlation coefficient  for selected cell wall genes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . on the basis of these results, we chose to use msgi  <dig>  as reference sequences for digital gene expression analysis of stems of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> 

transcript profiling of stems of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and 773
for transcript profiling of stems of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  we analyzed the rpkm-normalized digital gene expression counts for each sequence in msgi  <dig>  for cdna libraries derived from es and pes internodes of each genotype . among the  <dig>  sequences in msgi  <dig> , about  <dig> % were transcriptionally active  in at least one library while about  <dig> %  were silent in all four libraries examined  .

among the transcriptionally-active genes in each library, we identified the top  <dig> most abundant transcripts . the fisher's exact test with bonferroni correction  revealed that genes belonging to photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism and transport classes were significantly over-represented among the most abundantly expressed transcripts in all  <dig> libraries which suggests roles as housekeeping genes in alfalfa stems . we also identified functional classes over-represented among the most abundant genes expressed in a genotype- or tissue-specific manner suggesting their role in determining genotype or tissue identity . interestingly, genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were significantly over-represented among the most abundant genes. the lignin genes over-represented in one or more libraries include ccoaomt , ccr <dig>  and comt  genes . on the other hand, the transcription factor family class was significantly under-represented among the most abundant transcripts in three libraries . table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> most abundant protein-coding transcripts identified in each alfalfa stem internode library. interestingly, a putative comt gene  was among the top  <dig> most abundant protein-coding transcripts and it was up-regulated in  <dig>  in both es and pes internodes compared to  <dig> . the promoters of these highly expressed genes, including strong constitutive and tissue-specific promoters, may be useful for transgenic studies in alfalfa.

† top  <dig> most abundant protein-coding transcripts selected from each library are highlighted in bold. numbers enclosed in parenthesis represent rank based on transcript frequency for the top  <dig> most abundant protein-coding transcripts in each library.

we also identified putative housekeeping genes  that showed little variation in expression but were expressed at relatively high levels. to identify hkgs, we first selected genes with an average rpkm-normalized transcript count greater than  <dig>  next, we selected the top  <dig> genes with the lowest coefficient of variation    <cit> . these hkgs may be useful as reference genes in qrt-pcr or other experiments to normalize gene expression levels across different conditions  <cit> .

identification of differentially expressed genes
we used a ma-plot-based method with a random sampling model in a degseq program  <cit>  to identify genes differentially expressed between stems of alfalfa genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between es and pes tissues of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  . among the genes that were differentially expressed between es and pes internodes,  <dig> genes were detected in internodes of both genotypes. in addition, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> within es and pes internodes, respectively  . of the genes that were differentially expressed between the two genotypes,  <dig>  were detected in both es and pes internodes. among the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes identified in four pair-wise comparisons of es and pes internodes of the two genotypes, about 85% were ubiquitously expressed in all four libraries , about  <dig> % were expressed in three libraries, about  <dig> % were expressed in two libraries, and  <dig> genes were expressed in only one library . these results suggest that stem tissue internodes in alfalfa may be characterized on the basis of differential expression of ubiquitous genes or tissue/genotype-specific expression of selected genes as shown in previous studies with other species  <cit> . snps were detected in  <dig> differentially expressed genes. interestingly, about 14% of these snp-harboring differentially expressed genes were cell wall-related genes.

to illustrate the differential expression of genes detected in the stem internodes of  <dig> and  <dig>  we generated a heatmap of rpkm-normalized transcript counts for the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes in each pair-wise comparison . groups i and iii in figure  <dig> contain genes that were differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner which suggests their role in alfalfa stem development. for example, one expansin and four pectin esterase genes included in group i were up-regulated in es compared to pes internodes in both genotypes. these genes are involved in cell wall loosening and cell elongation  <cit> . on the other hand, a putative alfalfa cellulose synthase gene, irregular xylem  <dig> , included in group iii  was up-regulated in pes internodes compared to es in both genotypes. several previous studies demonstrated xylem specific expression of irx <dig> and its role in secondary cell wall development in arabidopsis  <cit> . groups ii and iv in figure  <dig> contain genes differentially expressed in a genotype-specific manner suggesting possible roles in the genotypic variation between stems of  <dig> and  <dig>  for example, two extensin genes and a cellulose synthase gene  included in group ii were up-regulated in genotype  <dig> compared to  <dig> in both es and pes internodes. these genes may be responsible for the higher cellulose content in stem internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to  <dig>  group v in figure  <dig> contains genes differentially expressed in both a genotype- and tissue-specific manner.

lignin content in alfalfa stems affects the quality of alfalfa as a forage crop and biomass feedstock. lignin is indigestible and reduces cell wall digestibility in ruminants  <cit> . in addition, the pre-treatment process to remove lignin is one the most costly steps of cellulosic ethanol production  <cit> . over multiple environments, alfalfa genotype  <dig> consistently showed higher cell wall lignin content in stems compared to genotype  <dig>  suggesting differences in the genetics of lignin biosynthesis. in an effort to identify key genes responsible for differences in cell wall properties in stems of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  we identified lignin  pathway genes among the  <dig>  genes detected . next, we generated a heatmap of gene expression ratios for each selected lignin pathway gene for each pair-wise comparison . the heatmaps generated were inserted into the lignin biosynthetic pathway . as expected, numerous lignin pathway genes were up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes . we also identified lignin genes differentially expressed between the two alfalfa genotypes. for example, several cad and comt genes were up-regulated in  <dig> compared to  <dig> especially in es internodes . these genes may contribute to difference in lignin content in cell walls of stems of genotypes  <dig> and  <dig> 

a previous study  <cit>  and the current study both suggest significant genotypic variation for gene expression in alfalfa stem internodes. to identify genes involved in general stem development  independent of genotypic variation in gene expression, we selected a subset of alfalfa genes differentially expressed between es and pes internodes in both genotype  <dig> and genotype  <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes were identified by further selecting genes with similar differential expression patterns in both genotypes  . among these genes, about 19% were cell wall-related genes. these genes included  <dig> cellulose synthase genes  and six lignin pathway genes  that were up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . in arabidopsis, irx <dig>  cesa <dig>  and cobra genes are involved in cellulose biosynthesis during secondary cell wall development  <cit> . the gene families that were significantly over-represented among genes up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes  included arabinogalactan protein , arginosuccinate synthase, metal handling, and transporter  families . the gene families significantly over-represented among genes up-regulated in es compared to pes internodes in both genotypes included invertase, pectin esterase, simple phenol, gibberellin-responsive, cold-responsive, lipid transfer protein , and gdsl-motif lipase families . cell wall family genes were over-represented among genes up-regulated in both es and pes internodes.

assimilated photosynthetic carbon is translocated primarily as sucrose in higher plants  <cit> . membrane-bound, energy dependent, h+-symporting sucrose transporters  play an essential role in sucrose uptake in sink tissues and sucrose release in source tissues  <cit> . in this study, members of the sucrose transporter gene family were over-represented among genes up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . previous studies showed that the expression of sucrose transporter genes was developmentally regulated in plants  <cit> . for example, sucrose transporter genes were up-regulated during secondary cell wall synthesis in developing cotton fibers  <cit> . in this study, we identified five putative sucrose transporters  that were up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . as stem development progresses from es to pes, sink strength may also increase due to secondary cell wall formation in secondary xylem. the up-regulation of mssucs in pes internodes may be in response to increased demand for sucrose and udp-glucose to support cellulose synthesis during secondary cell wall formation. consistent with this explanation is our finding that three sucrose synthase  genes were up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes. sucrose synthase provides the udp-glucose needed for cellulose synthesis  <cit> . in addition to their roles in providing sucrose and udp-glucose for cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls, mssucs and mssusy genes, respectively, may play important roles in modulating sugar sensing and signal transduction pathways during stem development in alfalfa  <cit> .

in addition to the suc transporter gene family, we also found that the phosphate  transporter gene family was over-represented among genes up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . we identified six putative phosphate <dig>  genes up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . in arabidopsis root epidermal and cortical cells, pho <dig> is involved in pi loading into the xylem  <cit> . a recessive mutation in pho <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in reduced pi loading into xylem  <cit> . pho <dig> is expressed predominantly in roots and up-regulated under conditions of pi starvation  <cit> . a recent study in arabidopsis showed that the expression of pho <dig> was modulated by wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> transcription factors in response to low pi  <cit> . up-regulation of pho <dig> genes in pes may be needed to meet the requirements of pi uptake and redistribution during cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls. for example, the fructose released by susy  needs to be phosphorylated to be recycled by sucrose phosphate synthase .

the plant hormone auxin is a key regulator of plant growth and development  <cit> . in addition to its role in cell wall loosening and cell elongation  <cit> , auxin also regulates vascular tissue differentiation and patterning in plants  <cit> , secondary xylem development in trees  <cit> , and fiber development in cotton  <cit> . indole-3-acetic acid , the major auxin species, is made in the shoot apex and transported to the root apex  <cit> . directional auxin transport is mainly controlled by the coordinated action of auxin influx  and efflux  carrier complexes  <cit> . aux <dig>  an amino acid permease-like membrane protein, was originally identified after screening for auxin resistant mutants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, aux <dig> was preferentially expressed in xylem compared to phloem and nonvascular tissues of the root-hypocotyl  <cit> . arabidopsis aux <dig> mutants showed a reduction in lateral root formation  <cit>  but enhanced root generation in shoot regeneration media  <cit> . in addition, disruption of polar auxin transport in arabidopsis resulted in ectopic vascular differentiation in leaves  <cit> . polarized auxin transport is essential for providing directional and positional signals for various developmental processes such as apical dominance, organ development, tropic growth, embryogenesis and vascular development  <cit> . in this study, the amino acid transporter gene families, which include aux <dig> genes, were over-represented among genes up-regulated in pes compared to es internodes in both genotypes . a total of  <dig> putative aux <dig> genes were up-regulated in pes .the up-regulation of aux <dig> in pes internodes of alfalfa and the resultant increase in auxin uptake may play an important role in the formation of secondary xylem. a recent study in trees suggested that the radial auxin concentration gradient in cell types of secondary xylem modulates the expression of a small number of key genes that regulate secondary xylem development  <cit> .

in addition to transporter family genes that were differentially expressed between es and pes internodes of both genotypes, we also identified transporter family genes that were differentially expressed between genotypes. for example, several sugar  transporters and aux <dig> genes were up-regulated in  <dig> compared to  <dig> in both es and pes internodes . these transporters may play a role in the higher cellulose and sugar  content in stem internodes of genotype  <dig> compared to  <dig> . we also identified numerous transporter families that were up-regulated in both es and pes internodes of  <dig> compared to  <dig>  among these up-regulated transporter families were the multi-drug toxic efflux carrier  and atp-binding cassette  transporter families . recent studies suggest that monolignols synthesized in the cytoplasm are transported across the plasma membrane into the cell wall matrix where they are polymerized into lignin  <cit> . however, little is known about the transport mechanism. previous studies have suggested that monolignol transport across the plasma membrane may involve passive diffusion  <cit>  or may be mediated by membrane-bound transporters  <cit> . genes in the mate transporter family may be good candidates for monolignol transporters because they are involved in transport of proanthocyanidin precursors across the tonoplast in arabidopsis and m. truncatula  <cit> . a role for abc transporters in monolignol transport across the plasma membrane has been postulated because of their known role in transporting various secondary metabolites in plants  <cit> . additional research will be required to determine whether the up-regulation of the mate efflux carrier and abc transporter families in stems of  <dig>  compared to  <dig>   contributes to the higher lignin content in cell walls of  <dig> . the up-regulated mate efflux carrier and abc transport genes that we identified provide a list of candidate genes that will be useful in future research to evaluate the involvement of these gene families in monolignol transport.

CONCLUSIONS
this study represents the first application of rna-seq technology for genomic studies in alfalfa. our results demonstrate that rna-seq can be successfully used for gene identification, polymorphism detection and transcript profiling in alfalfa. using rna-seq has several advantages over other technologies, especially for non-model species with few genomic resources such as alfalfa. unlike hybridization-based technologies such as microarrays, rna-seq does not require pre-existing sequence information and, as shown in this study, rna-seq can integrate multiple tasks in a single pipeline saving time and money. the integrated approach used in this study can be applied to other non-model species. the newly built alfalfa gene index , and the snps, ssrs and candidate genes identified in this study will be a valuable resource for advancing genetic/genomic research in alfalfa and eventually for improving alfalfa as a forage crop and cellulosic ethanol feedstock.
