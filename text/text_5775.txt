BACKGROUND
wheat is the first most important field crop worldwide in terms of crop value and total production. wheat production is limited by both biotic and abiotic factors  <cit> . insect infestations are major factors for post harvest loss of grain quantity and quality. preventing or at least slowing the stored product infestation is important in maintaining wheat’s quality and marketable volume  <cit> . insect pests contaminate stored cereals and cause damage by their feeding, producing highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds, and creation of allergens. additionally, their metabolic products change the smell and taste of the contaminated baking products  <cit> . there is an urgent need to eliminate wheat insect infestation in stores, during transportation and processing, which ensures a supply of wholesome food to the consumers  <cit> . chemical insecticides are being used to reduce the negative impact of the transmission of the insect infestations  <cit> . complete dependency on the heavy use of chemicals has created numerous unacceptable agricultural, environmental and human health problems. another concern is the development of resistance in target organisms  <cit> . these factors have encouraged the scientific community to discover alternative, bio-friendly, economically acceptable strategies for insect control . considerable progress has been made over the past two decades in manipulating genes from diverse sources and inserting them into crop plants to confer resistance to insect pests, diseases, tolerance to herbicides, drought, improved nutritional quality, increased effectiveness of bio-control agents, and a better understanding of the nature of gene action and metabolic pathways . transgenic biotechnology can be utilized as an alternative choice for protection of crops from attack by insect pests using insect growth-inhibiting proteins e.g., insect chitinase  <cit> , cry protein  <cit> , vip3a protein  <cit>  and avidin protein  <cit> . if genes coding for these proteins are introduced into wheat with adequate and stable expression, they can provide resistance against stored product pests over several generations. avidin is a glycoprotein that binds biotin strongly and prevents acquisition of biotin by many organisms  <cit> . biotin is a cofactor needed during important carboxylation reactions. insects have no biosynthetic pathway for biotin and thus, must obtain it from other sources. therefore, diets containing avidin are toxic to a wide range of insects  <cit> . the molecular weight of avidin is about 67 kda. the insecticidal effect of chicken avidin has been known since  <dig> when it was first reported that the protein is toxic to the housefly, musca domestica  <cit> , this effect is due to the strong binding of avidin to biotin  <cit> . due to its insecticidal properties, avidin has been expressed in a variety of agriculturally important plant species, for example, tobacco, maize and rice  <cit> . avidin differs from other transgenic insecticidal toxins because it is not directly damaging to tissues, rather it merely withholds an essential nutrient from the insects  <cit> . the biotin binding activity of avidin is greatly destroyed by cooking, rendering the avidin harmless to humans following cooking. in the same way that cooked eggs  are not harmful to humans and are considered as a normal component of many people's diet  <cit> . ninety seven percent of avidin's functional activity is lost by heat denaturation  at 95 °c for 5 min. in addition, avidin has the considerable advantage over conventional insecticides that it is not washed away during processing and continues to act as an insecticide during storage  <cit> . in this study, we introduced a modified avidin gene into wheat in order to protect it from stored product insects, and we investigated the insecticidal activity of transgenic wheat against wheat weevil.

southern blot analysis
total genomic dna isolated from leaf tissue of plants that tested positive in the leaf painting assay with the herbicide and these that tested positive in pcr analyses of putative transgenics as well as the non-transgenic wheat cultivar giza  <dig> as negative control were digested with the restriction enzyme mixture of spei and ncoi. the digestion products were subjected to electrophoresis followed by southern blot analyses and hybridized with the hindiii/spei restriction fragment  of the pahc17/avidin/bar plasmid, which was used as a probe to confirm the integration of pahc17/avidin/bar construct in the wheat genome. figure  <dig> shows the hybridization patterns of the probe with genomic dna of the six putative transgenics  and the negative control . as expected, a fragment with expected size  was detected from genomic dna of the six transgenics and was completely absent from the non-transgenic wheat cultivar . different insertion sites patterns  confirms that the six transgenic events were independently originated from multiple independent embryogenic calli representing different integration events. in addition, the numbers and sizes of bands indicated different copy numbers of the transgene avidin. for example avd <dig> has four copies and avd <dig> has two copies and avd <dig> has one copy. semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  analysis: expression of the integrated gene was tested on the rna extracts of the t <dig> plants that showed positive results after being sprayed with the basta herbicide. the results of avidin gene expression indicated the presence of the expected cdna band size 496 bp . sqrt-pcr detected differential expression levels between the six transgenic lines. the transcription level of avidin in the avd <dig>  avd <dig>  avd <dig> and avd <dig> is shown to be relatively higher than those of avd  <dig> and avd <dig> lines.fig.  <dig> genomic southern blot analysis of the six avidin transgenic plants avd <dig>  avd <dig>  avd <dig>  avd <dig>  avd <dig> and avd <dig> . genomic dna of each line was digested with ncoi and spei and fragmented by  <dig>  % agarose gel electrophoresis. the blot was probed with a spei and hindiii fragment involving a maize ubi intron 1and maize ubi promoter, ubi . m,  <dig> kb neb dna ladder , hindiii-digested dna of non-transgenic giza  <dig> cultivar

discussion
wheat is an important staple crop in many countries. depending on the climatic and storage conditions, it can become infested by a wide variety of stored-product insect pests  <cit> . avidin-containing wheat and its processed products would be resistant to infestations caused by all of the species. detection and control methods for stored product insects have to be through integrated pest management program . major efforts involving sanitation practices, exclusion techniques, habitat modifications, fumigation, and insecticide applications are usually required to prevent damage. the conventional insect control method is mainly dependent on the intensive and extensive use of chemical pesticides, which have drawbacks such as doing harm to the ecological system, producing residual poisons to human beings and animals, and high cost. moreover, some insects have developed resistance to some of the available insecticides  <cit> . therefore, it is desirable to develop insect-resistant plants through the introduction of insect-resistant genes  through genetic transformation. in present study, synthetic avidin coding dna was transferred to wheat plants. avidin accumulation was detected in transgenic plants by elisa and western dot blot. we found that avidin wheat has excellent resistance to storage insects. bioassay experiments proved that insect mortality in the first week was about 30 %, in second week it was about 70 % and in the third week the mortality was 100 %. similar results were obtained with the red flour beetle tribolium confusum, and flat grain beetle cryptolestes pusillus  <cit> . avidin transgenic tobacco halted growth and it caused mortality in larvae of two lepidopterans, helicoverpa armigera and spodoptera litura. the insects showed very poor growth over their first 8 days on a diet consisting of the leaves from transgenic plants and significant mortality were reported after  <dig> or 12 days and all insects were dead after 22 days  <cit> . in conclusion, the stable avidin transgenic wheat showed high level of resistance to the stored product insect . this study will hopefully decrease the loss of wheat seeds in warehouses significantly. in addition, the avidin-transgenic wheat powder can be used as a bioinsecticide. avidin may interfere with enzymes that depend on enzyme bound biotin, such as those involved in carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions  <cit> . biotin deficiency in the blowfly, aldrichina grahami, caused decreases in several fatty acids  <cit> . presumably, a similar biochemical effect led to the stunted growth and mortality of the stored-product insects studied here. the public acceptability of avidin wheat as a food or feed is difficult to predict. careful examination of its safety, however, is needed before consumption by humans and livestock can be considered. kramer et al.,  <cit>  reported that at least there is no acute toxicity of avidin when feed to mice. long-term ingestion of high levels of avidin maize may be a problem, because a biotin deficiency can decrease the growth rate of mice and affect reproduction  <cit> . however, avidin is a food protein that is consumed in the form of egg at a concentration of > <dig> part per million  by dry weight, which is four times higher than its concentration in most of the wheat used in the present study. moreover, avidin has an antidote , which can be used to prevent toxicity or to rescue potential victims from adverse effects. food and feed uses of avidin wheat might involve processing that includes supplementation with the vitamins. another method that would help to prevent potential toxicity of the avidin wheat is the heat treatment, which would denature most of the avidin as well as the avidin–biotin complex and release most of the vitamins . currently development of wheat expressing transgenic avidin as a food or feed grain could be considered after thorough risk assessment. in addition to its efficacy against postharvest insect pests, avidin also is effective against preharvest pests such as the beet armyworm, black cutworm, bollworm, and other species for which biotin is an essential growth factor  <cit> . transferring the avidin gene to other crops will be important in determining its potential usefulness in a variety of other commercial protein production and pest control situations. risk assessment of these transgenics can be done following the national biosafety committee guidelines for the most efficient avidin-transgenic line. in addition, different species of stored cereals insects can be challenged with the avidin transgenic wheat grains and flour.

CONCLUSIONS
a synthetic avidin gene was introduced into spring wheat  cv. giza  <dig> using a biolistic bombardment protocol. functional integrity of avidin was confirmed by insect bioassay. the results of bioassay using transgenic wheat plants challenged with wheat weevil revealed 100 % mortality of the insects reared on transgenic plants after 21 days. in conclusion, the stable avidin transgenic wheat showed high level of resistance to the stored product insect .

this study will hopefully decrease the loss of wheat seeds in warehouses significantly.
