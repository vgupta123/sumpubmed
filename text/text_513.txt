BACKGROUND
atlantic salmon  is a species of economic importance to both wild fisheries and aquaculture production. the worldwide production of atlantic salmon through aquaculture has increased rapidly over recent years, and is now approximately  <dig> million tonnes per annum  <cit> . large-scale salmon breeding programs were first established in the 1970s  <cit> , and the typical four-year generation interval means that selected lines of farmed salmon remain just a few generations from ancestral wild fish  <cit> . family-based selection has resulted in rapid improvement in economically important traits, including growth, age at maturation and resistance to pathogens  <cit>  . genetic markers have been critical for this process, and are often utilised for family assignment and mapping loci of economic importance. microsatellite and snp resources are available for atlantic salmon  <cit> , and the ongoing genome sequencing project is anticipated to result in further genetic marker discovery  <cit> . however, the genomics resources available still lag behind terrestrial livestock species, which hinders the application of genomic selection  <cit>  and fine-scale analysis of the genomic regulation of scientifically and economically important traits. furthermore, due to the diverse ancestral origins of different breeding programmes, marker assays developed from a single reference genome or a limited set of genomes may not be fully informative in a population or family of interest.

advances in high-throughput short-read sequencing technology have facilitated rapid and cost-efficient generation of gigabases of data by individual laboratories. this has led to new approaches for simultaneous discovery and genotyping of dense genetic markers on a scale that represents a step change from the state of the art prior to this technology  <cit> . one such approach is restriction-site associated dna  sequencing , which is a genome complexity reduction technique that sequences at depth flanking regions of restriction enzyme cleavage sites  <cit> . this enables reliable base calling and snp identification. rad-seq is typically applied to multiplexed samples, where dna fragments are ligated to a sample-specific barcode sequence for pooled sequencing, with subsequent in silico assignment of reads to samples enabling individual and population-level genotyping  <cit> . rad-seq data can be readily analyzed without a reference genome, which makes the technique particularly applicable to non-model organisms, including atlantic salmon. it can be applied in lieu of or in addition to other snp assay technologies, because rad-seq can generate a large-scale population-specific marker set with individual genotypes.

one of the main foci of qtl mapping studies in atlantic salmon to date has been the genetic regulation of host resistance to disease  <cit> . the most striking example is the discovery of a locus explaining almost all of the genetic variation in resistance to infectious pancreatic necrosis  <cit> . ipn is a viral disease, the causal agent of which is a highly contagious birnavirus that can cause high levels of mortality at both the early freshwater and sea water stages of the salmon lifecycle  <cit> . an individual's possession of one or two favourable copies of the resistance allele markedly reduces the likelihood of mortality, the magnitude of which is dependent on the severity of the overall epidemic. however, studies by scottish and norwegian research groups have independently verified the large difference in mortality between alternate qtl homozygotes in both controlled challenge and ‘field’ seawater exposures, with estimates of mortality proportion ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  <cit> . the resistance allele has been selected for in breeding programs using marker-assisted selection  <cit> , but the causal gene and mutation remain elusive. the position of the qtl has been narrowed to a 3 cm confidence interval on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . however, locating and investigating the underlying gene requires a higher density of genetic markers within the qtl region than is currently available.

the salmon genome, in common with other salmonid species, has undergone a duplication event 25– <dig> mya, and it demonstrates residual tetrasomic inheritance. this is evidenced by extensive gene duplication and homeology across much of the genome and quadrivalent formation at meiosis in males  <cit> . a related complication in salmonid genomics is the high number of paralogous sequence variants  which can appear as putative snps in sequence alignment analysis, and need to be distinguished from true segregating snps. for example, hohenlohe et al. used excess heterozygosity to exclude psvs from rad-derived snp panels generated for both rainbow trout  and cutthroat trout   <cit> , while sanchez et al. utilised double-haploid rainbow trout to filter out psvs discovered using reduced representation sequencing  <cit> . additionally, there is extreme heterochiasmy in salmon, with very little recombination over large sections of the genome in males, while females demonstrate more typical patterns of crossover and recombination. this is evident in the linkage maps that have been created for atlantic salmon to date, where ratios of female:male recombination rates have been estimated at between  <dig> : <dig> and  <dig> : <dig>  <cit> . the most recent atlantic salmon linkage map highlights a large difference in the genomic distribution of male and female recombination, with male recombination more common near putative telomeres  <cit> . a recent study using rad-seq also demonstrated a general lack of male recombination in rainbow trout by the clustering of the majority of markers proximal to putative centromeric positions in the linkage map  <cit> .

in the current study, our aim was to discover, verify and genotype a large number of polymorphic markers in the atlantic salmon genome, with a particular focus on markers linked to the ipn resistance qtl. by applying rad-seq to parent and offspring samples, we aimed to verify marker segregation and help identify and distinguish between snps and psvs. we also utilised the lack of salmon male recombination to analyse genome-wide patterns of rad marker segregation from sires to offspring to identify putative linkage groups. to identify trait and qtl-linked markers, we used heterozygous parents and their offspring of known ipn resistance phenotype and qtl genotype  to identify candidate resistance and susceptibility alleles though linkage. a subset of trait and qtl-linked snp markers were then verified using a high-throughput assay applied to larger populations of ipnv-challenged atlantic salmon.

RESULTS
rad-seq data processing
two families were identified from an earlier qtl mapping experiment as having both sire and dam heterozygous for the ipn resistance qtl  <cit> . using microsatellite markers from atlantic salmon linkage group  <dig> , seven offspring from each family were classified as homozygous for the resistance allele and seven of their siblings were classified as homozygous for the susceptibility allele . dna from each of these fish was used to construct multiplexed rad-seq libraries and sequenced at high depth using a 100 bp paired-end strategy on an illumina platform. detailed explanations of the rad-seq technique have been given elsewhere  <cit> . however, for an explanation of some of the terminology used in the current study, please refer to the ‘rad-seq terminology’ section of the methods.

the experiment was designed to generate very high illumina sequence coverage for the parents to obtain a clearly defined reference set of rad alleles to which the lower-coverage offspring sequences could be compared . following read demultiplexing using the sample-specific penta-nucleotide barcodes, there were between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads per parent, and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads per offspring . in total,  <dig>  rad alleles were detected, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  alleles defined in families  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, comprising  <dig>  common alleles and  <dig>  family-specific alleles. these rad alleles were clustered into  <dig>  and  <dig>  rad loci in families  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, of which  <dig>  were common  . as the sbfi restriction site is palindromic, reads are obtained in both directions from the site and, therefore, the number of rad loci is expected to be twice the number of restriction sites in the genome.

genome-wide rad loci
the number of rad alleles per rad locus ranged from one  to  <dig>  . rad loci containing many  rad alleles are likely to be due to an sbfi site within frequently occurring repeat elements, which are common in the salmon genome  <cit> . a single allele at a rad locus does not necessarily indicate monomorphism because a polymorphism in the sbfi restriction site itself would still result in an observable presence/absence segregation pattern in the offspring. the second most common type of rad loci  were those with exactly two rad alleles , which are likely to contain both snps and psvs. for the current study, we focus on these bi-allelic rad loci to detect genome-wide snps/psvs, as well as qtl-linked snps. a minority of rad loci  had three or more rad alleles. these less tractable polymorphisms, possibly the result of polymorphic duplicated regions of the genome , repeat elements containing sbfi sites, multi-allelic snps or multiple snps, were not considered further in this study. overall, the frequency pattern of clustering of rad alleles into rad loci was similar for the two families .

bi-allelic loci containing snps and psvs
to identify candidate bi-allelic segregating snps, and to distinguish these from non-segregating bi-allelic psvs, filtering of rad loci containing exactly two rad alleles was performed as described in the methods. rad loci where both rad alleles were present in both parents and all offspring  were classified as putative psvs. we identified  <dig>  bi-allelic rad loci with this excessive heterozygosity in family  <dig> and  <dig>  in family  <dig>  of which  <dig>  were common between the two families . the overlap between the probable psv-locus-derived rad alleles in the two families is expected, since these are likely to reflect fixed differences between homeologous genomic regions. we filtered the remaining rad loci  to remove those where there was >  <dig> base divergence between the alleles, as this level of divergence exceeds that expected in simple allelic loci. the final set of high-confidence bi-allelic snps  included  <dig>  snps identified in  <dig>  rad loci in family  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps identified in  <dig>  rad loci in family  <dig>  in this final set of bi-allelic rad markers across the two families there were  <dig>  segregating snps, of which  <dig>  were segregating in both families . there were an approximately equal number of transitions  and transversions  in both families .

b filtering criteria given in the ‘methods’.

genome-wide segregation patterns
sire-based linkage clusters of rad markers were developed by applying a similar approach to baxter et al. <cit> , and utilising the paucity of male recombination in atlantic salmon. within the filtered set of bi-allelic rad markers, the frequency of segregation patterns of all rad alleles that were observed in the sire and showed a presence/absence segregation pattern in the offspring  was compared. the most frequently observed segregation patterns are expected to correspond to a set of fully linked rad markers in these families . for a full explanation of the expected segregation patterns using radtools refer to ‘rad allele segregation’ in the methods.

in family  <dig>   <dig>  sire-segregating rad markers were identified, of which  <dig>   clustered into the most frequent  <dig>  different segregation patterns . the remaining  <dig> rad markers displayed  <dig> different segregation patterns. these data indicate that much of the surveyed genome is inherited without male recombination in this family, although further insight into this phenomenon will require a more detailed snp genotyping and linkage analysis in larger families. in comparison, the same analysis of dam-based segregation revealed  <dig>  segregating rad markers, of which  <dig>  clustered into the top  <dig> most frequently occurring pairs of segregation patterns . in family  <dig>   <dig>  of the  <dig> identified sire-segregating markers clustered into the most frequent  <dig> pairs of segregation patterns , with the remaining  <dig> markers displaying  <dig> different segregation patterns. however, due to the overall lower number of segregation patterns in this family, the distinction between patterns likely to correspond to linkage groups and other patterns was not as clear-cut as for family  <dig>  twenty seven pairs of segregation patterns was the most obvious empirical cut-off.

when the rad marker allele sequences showing the most frequent segregation patterns  were compared across the two families, matches could be made between specific linkage clusters. due to the need for sire heterozygosity and dam homozygosity for the segregation pattern at a given polymorphism to be observed , only a proportion of the rad alleles from any of the linkage clusters would be expected to match between families. for example, even given a minor allele frequency of  <dig> , the chance of observing a snp matching this pattern in any given family is  <dig>  . it was possible to match  <dig> out of the  <dig> putative rad linkage clusters in family  <dig> through this allelic homology to putative linkage clusters in family  <dig> . with only one exception, rad marker alleles from one linkage cluster in family  <dig> matched exclusively to one cluster from family  <dig>  and vice versa. this suggests that the linkage clusters are consistent between the two families.

c ipn qtl-containing chromosome.

qtl-linked rad alleles
to identify rad alleles linked to the ipn resistance locus in the two families, all rad alleles were screened for segregation patterns that matched the qtl genotype  and the ipn mortality phenotype . in family  <dig>  there were  <dig> resistance-linked rad alleles and  <dig> susceptibility-linked rad alleles . in family  <dig>  there were  <dig> resistance and  <dig> susceptibility-linked rad alleles. both resistance and susceptibility-linked rad alleles were identified in  <dig> rad markers in family  <dig>  compared to six rad markers in family  <dig>  with two of these loci being common across families. for calling qtl-linked snps, rad markers that contain resistance or susceptibility rad alleles were also screened for rad alleles that nearly match the qtl genotype pattern  in total, there were  <dig> qtl-linked snps identified using these criteria, of which four were segregating in both families, and three of these common snps were perfectly linked to the qtl. a subset of snps with sufficient flanking sequence data for a high-throughput genotyping assay design were identified, and details of all suitable qtl-segregating snps in both families and a subset of those only segregating in family  <dig>  were provided to kbioscience ltd  for assay design . of these,  <dig> assays were successful and four failed. from the successful assays, two putative snps returned monomorphic genotype data in a test plate of qtl-segregating samples, leaving  <dig> true segregating rad snps suitable for larger-scale genotyping and linkage analysis.

qtl linkage mapping
the  <dig> ipn qtl-linked snps were genotyped across the linkage mapping population . three previously published snps  <cit>  and five novel snps, closely linked to the qtl , were also genotyped across the same samples . 3sequence details of the snps used in the qtl mapping analysis are given in additional file  <dig>  finally, an additional two microsatellite markers also from contig fps <dig>  were genotyped across the same samples. these new genotypes were combined with existing data from three microsatellite markers  <cit>  in the mapping analysis. all markers  showed highly significant linkage to each other and to the qtl in our mapping population. a dam-based linkage map was then built for the qtl region , with markers omitted if the crimap software could not position the markers in the map. the map covered  <dig>  cm which indicates that the qtl-linked markers detected through rad sequencing were dispersed over a large section of the chromosome.

a dam-based regression interval mapping analysis of the map, genotype and trait  data was performed using gridqtl  <cit> . the qtl was mapped to a position of 21 cm on the new map, and the bootstrap analysis  gave the average qtl location as  <dig>  cm and defined the confidence interval as 2 cm between  <dig> and 22 cm . the flanking markers for the confidence interval were ssa0139ecig and rad_ht01/ssa0019ecig. these results provide a reduced confidence interval  for the qtl in our populations compared to previous work  <cit> , and a minor reduction compared to study of moen et al. .

snp-trait association
to assess the population-wide association between the most tightly qtl-linked snps  and ipn mortality, the snps were genotyped across a population of  <dig>  ipnv-challenged salmon fry from  <dig> full-sib families deriving from two year groups of the landcatch natural selection broodstock. the markers rad_ht <dig> and ssa0139ecig showed consistent and highly significant association with ipn mortality  across the two yearclasses of fish , implying linkage disequilibrium between the snp alleles and the qtl alleles in these populations. ssa0019ecig showed inconsistent effects in the two year groups  which is likely to be due to its segregation in only a few families  the contrast in mortality level between the homozygous resistant snp genotype and the homozygous susceptible snp genotype was 53% and 46% for rad_ht <dig> and ssa0139ecig respectively.

discussion
in this study, rad-seq has been used to discover, verify and genotype novel genetic markers in pedigreed atlantic salmon. by targeting individuals of known disease resistance phenotype and genotype at a major qtl, we discovered and scored novel qtl-linked snps with flanking sequence. the use of pedigreed  samples allowed us to examine segregation of rad markers, linkage patterns, and to distinguish rad loci containing putative snps from those containing putative paralogous sequence variants . the outcomes of the study include a new snp resource for atlantic salmon, high-coverage sequence data at sites dispersed throughout the genome, improved knowledge of a genome region harbouring a qtl of major importance to salmon aquaculture and improved population ld-based genetic tests for resistance to ipn.

the rad library sequence data were analysed with the radtools pipeline  <cit> . in this method, unique rad reads are filtered based on quality score and clustered into rad loci based on sequence similarity within and across individuals. further analyses of the data defined putative snps and psvs within rad loci and examined the segregation patterns of alleles within these loci by looking at presence or absence of alleles in individual animals using methods similar to those used by baxter et al. <cit> . these analyses were suitable for our main goals; the thresholds we chose for defining rad loci and for distinguishing genuine segregation patterns from fluctuations in read counts were empirically derived and conservative. genotypes in our dataset were defined as ‘presence’ or ‘absence’ of a rad allele, and as such the rad markers were effectively acting as dominant markers. although we did not attempt it in our study, it may be possible to use the fragment count data to differentiate homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, or to identify putative multisite variants based on an excess of one particular allele. indeed, the recently published software pipeline ‘stacks’ also detects and genotypes snps in short-read sequence data, and uses a maximum likelihood algorithm to call heterozygous and homozygous genotypes based on read counts  <cit> . this software has recently been used to create linkage maps in the spotted gar  <cit> . as rad-seq continues to develop as a means of genotyping by sequencing, the analysis pipeline is likely to become increasingly robust, standardised and automated, which will broaden its utility and improve consistency.

 a notable outcome from our analyses of the most frequent patterns of segregation was the degree of clustering of sire-based segregation patterns . in one family, 82% of sire segregating rad markers clustered into the  <dig> most frequent presence/absence patterns  which correspond to the number of chromosomes in european atlantic salmon, without similar clustering in a dam-based analysis. the remaining patterns of segregation may represent male recombination, but are also likely to include patterns that are artefacts due to sequencing errors or false negative allele nulls due to read coverage fluctuation for example. it is well-established that recombination rate is low in regions of the male salmon genome  <cit> , and the current data are consistent with an absence of recombination over much of the genome sampled with sbfi in these families. a similar analysis of dam-based linkage patterns in the diamondback moth assigned approximately 65% of rad markers to  <dig> pairs of binary patterns, a species with  <dig> chromosomes and no recombination in females  <cit> . the most recent salmon linkage map suggests that the differences in recombination between males and females are mainly due to the location of crossovers, which are thought to generally cluster towards the telomeres in males  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the rad linkage clusters in the current study correspond to non-telomeric regions where male recombination is very low. it is noteworthy that in the recent study of miller et al. <cit> , the vast majority of identified snps in their hybrid rainbow trout populations also clustered towards the putative centromeres. however, the physical distances encompassed by these linkage clusters are unknown, and may include the majority of the chromosome. our segregation data are based on analyses of two families containing  <dig> offspring each, and further insight into recombination patterns between the rad markers will require construction of a linkage map in larger families using the sbfi rad markers.

 in both the qtl analysis and the bi-allelic segregation pattern analysis, there were notably fewer rad markers in family  <dig> compared to family  <dig>  there were some differences in the sequencing technology used for these libraries, and we examined the quality scores and their drop-off by position in the read for both families. family  <dig> offspring had marginally better average sequence quality readings than family  <dig>  but the number of rad alleles defined, the number of rad alleles per locus, and the number of snps were all reasonably consistent between the two families . in the overall unfiltered rad dataset, there were  <dig>  and  <dig>  rad alleles in family  <dig> that show sire and dam segregation patterns respectively, versus  <dig>  and  <dig>  in family  <dig>  therefore, given that sire heterozygosity and dam homozygosity are required to observe a sire-segregation pattern, the differences could reflect greater homozygosity in the family  <dig> sire and/or greater heterozygosity in the dam. however, there was zero inbreeding for the four parents of these families, making substantial differences in homozygosity unlikely.

some dissimilarity in rad marker clustering was also observed between the two families. for example, the top ranked linkage cluster  in family  <dig> was only the 18th largest cluster in family  <dig>  and rad alleles in linkage cluster  <dig> in family  <dig> were split over two linkage clusters in family  <dig> . while these observations may be due to technical bias, it is also possible that they indicate real differences in the rate and/or position of chiasma formation between the two male parents. the extent and pattern of tetravalent pairing in male salmonids and resultant residual tetrasomic manifestations are considered to be influenced by the degree of similarity among the chromosome complement of individuals. aberrant segregations are thought to be more common in genomes from crosses between genetically divergent individuals  <cit> . furthermore, robertsonian polymorphisms have been observed between and within atlantic salmon populations with 2n chromosome number thought to vary between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that genetic heterogeneity, including possible karyotypic differences within the farm strain could explain some of the differences between the families.

 a subset of qtl-linked snp markers were genotyped at a population level and assessed for linkage and association with ipn mortality. previous studies by our group  <cit>  and moen et al. <cit>  have mapped the ipn-resistance qtl to a region of linkage group  <dig> with a confidence interval of 10 cm and 3 cm respectively. in the current study, the genotyped qtl-linked rad snps were spread across a large region of our linkage map  and the qtl confidence interval was narrowed marginally to 2 cm. in the study of moen et al. <cit> , microsatellite marker haplotypes showing population-level association with ipn mortality were identified by establishing the phase-relationship between the qtl allele and the marker haplotype in qtl-heterozygous parent  <cit> . however, several different marker haplotypes were associated with a particular qtl allele which hinders the practical application of population ld- based selection. here we demonstrate that a rad-derived snp  and a previously published snp  show highly significant population-level association with ipn mortality, implying strong ld between these snps and the qtl in the landcatch natural selection broodstock population. we do not know how physically close these snps are to the qtl causal mutation, and the level of ld is likely to vary from population to population. the short timescale and cost-efficiency of our rad-seq approach highlights its utility for qtl-linked marker generation and fine-mapping. additional qtl-linked rad markers can be generated by using a different restriction enzyme, and the rad approach we applied herein can be applied to map loci affecting other economically important traits.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used rad-seq in pedigreed atlantic salmon to discovery, verify and genotype novel markers dispersed throughout the genome, including snps linked to a major qtl. these markers are likely to be important for future salmonid genomics research, and will have applications in aquaculture for selective breeding. integration with existing salmon genome maps is a prerequisite for this, and is underway. we have discovered  <dig> segregating snp markers linked in at least one family to a major qtl affecting resistance to the viral disease ipn, and have used high-throughput genotyping assay for a subset of markers to identify those with population-wide utility as tests for resistance to the disease. rad-seq of pooled animals of disparate phenotypes or qtl genotypes is likely to have broad utility for mapping the genomic regulation of important quantitative traits in a cost and time efficient manner.
