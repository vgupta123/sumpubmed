BACKGROUND
wood is the major component of terrestrial plant biomass and is expected to play a significant role in future sustainable development as a renewable and environmentally acceptable source for fibers, solid wood and biofuel products  <cit> . furthermore, wood is an important sink for atmospheric co <dig>  an excess of which is a major cause of global warming.

the production of wood or secondary xylem by xylogenesis is a remarkable example of terminal differentiation, producing a complex three-dimensional tissue specialized in conduction and mechanical support. this differentiation process comprises four major steps: cell division, cell expansion, deposition of lignified secondary cell wall and programmed cell death. the vascular cambium is the meristem tissue responsible for this differentiation process and, thus, for the extensive radial secondary growth of trees, ensuring regular renewal of functional secondary xylem and phloem during the lifespan of these perennial species.

trees are long-living organisms that grow in a variable environment and are subject to developmental cues. as a consequence, wood is highly variable at the tissue level  as well as at the cellular level . anatomical, chemical and physical differences in wood properties are not only widespread from tree to tree, but also within a single tree  <cit> . for instance, variations between juvenile and mature wood present within the same tree produce distinct wood properties such as density and pulp yield  <cit> .

the genus eucalyptus is one of the main sources of wood worldwide and is the most widely used tree species in industrial plantations. many eucalyptus species are renowned for their fast growth, straight form, valuable wood properties, wide adaptability to soils and climates, and ease of management through coppicing . according to the united nations food and agriculture organization  <cit> , eucalyptus is the principal hardwood species used for pulp extraction, with  <dig> million hectares of industrial plantations worldwide.

because of their comparatively long generation times, forest trees are still at the early stages of domestication compared to crop species, with most breeding programs only one or two generations away from the wild. nevertheless, the genetics of eucalyptus is becoming one of the most advanced in forestry  <cit> . nowadays, wood traits, which rely mainly on lignified secondary cell wall properties, are the key focus to many breeding programs. eucalyptus breeding programs will thus benefit from genomic technologies that could significantly speed up the process of genetic improvement  <cit> .

the genomes of most eucalyptus species are very similar to those of poplar species, with a relatively small size  and diploid inheritance . in addition, the eucalyptus trees are fast growing, most species are amenable to clonal propagation and some can be genetically transformed. these features make eucalyptus particularly suitable for genomic technologies and a growing number of genetic tools  as well as est collections are becoming available for some species. however, the huge commercial potential of eucalypts has fostered a situation in which access to genomic resources is restricted to a small number of private research consortia. these limitations may be overcome by the initiative of an international eucalyptus genome consortium  <cit> , which promoted the sequencing project of the eucalyptus grandis genome undertaken by the us department of energy.

because wood quality is a major trait that tree breeders would like to improve by using marker-assisted selection, it is important to increase publicly available eucalyptus genomic resources, including putative candidate genes involved in the genetic control of wood properties. indeed, recent advances in the molecular study of xylogenesis have revealed that wood formation is under strong genetic control, notably at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the production and analysis of ests from wood-forming tissues has increased our understanding of gene regulation involved in wood formation in tree species including loblolly pine  <cit> , poplar  <cit> , and white spruce  <cit> . similarly, large scale sequencing of ests will be instrumental for the annotation of the eucalyptus genome sequence. as a first step towards this goal, we have generated two secondary xylem subtractive libraries  rendering  <dig> unigenes preferentially or specifically expressed in differentiating secondary eucalyptus gunnii secondary xylem  <cit> , and providing a useful tool for gene profiling  <cit> .

here we present the sequencing of  <dig>  normalized clones from a e. gunnii secondary xylem cdna library generated in our laboratory  <cit> . in addition, we report the construction and sequencing of two suppression subtractive hybridization  libraries aimed at identifying genes differentially expressed in juvenile vs mature wood and vice versa. sequencing of these est libraries was performed in the framework of the french project forest  <cit>  whose goal was to release ests sequences from woody species through public databases. eucalyptus est sequences produced in our lab have been assembled into a unigene dataset called eucawood and the unigenes have been functionally annotated and compared with other plant species. the functional annotation of the unigene set is discussed in the context of the wood formation process.

RESULTS
construction and sequencing of normalized libraries
with the aim of sequencing a large number of ests representative of the set of mrnas expressed in secondary xylem, we chose a cdna library prepared from the differentiating secondary xylem of e. gunnii  containing  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones  <cit> , which has already proven a good source of genes expressed during wood formation  <cit> . because in cdna libraries, each cdna occurs at a frequency proportional to that of its corresponding mrna in the tissue it was prepared from, prevalent and intermediate frequency classes of mrnas are expected to be overwhelming in a random large scale sequencing program. in order to minimize this redundancy and increase the chance of identifying low-expressed genes, we decided to normalize the xylcdna library according to the protocol of bonaldo  <cit> . during the normalization procedure, human desmin cdna was added at  <dig>  copies to the non-normalized library whereas egcad <dig>  of which  <dig> cdna copies were present before normalization, served as an internal control. after normalization, six copies of desmin and five copies of egcad <dig> were recovered, demonstrating that redundancy in the library was drastically reduced by the normalization procedure. thus, the representation of the different genes expressed in secondary xylem was expected to be increased among the  <dig>  clones of the normalized xylcdna library as compared to the original library.

all  <dig>  xylcdna clones were sequenced from the 5' end. following vector and low-quality sequence trimming,  <dig>  high quality sequences with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides  were retained. sixty three percent  of the sequences were longer than  <dig> nt and only six percent  were shorter than  <dig> nt, indicating the quality of the library. these  <dig>  sequences were deposited in the embl-ebi nucleotide database .

to complement this set of ests, we decided to seek for genes that are differentially expressed in juvenile and mature secondary xylem tissues. the transition from juvenile to mature xylem is known to be an important source of variation in wood quality  <cit> . we took advantage of ssh technology, known to equalize the level of representation of rare and abundant fragments  <cit> , to reciprocally subtract cdnas prepared from juvenile and mature secondary xylem tissues. thus, we produced two ssh libraries: a juvenile vs mature  and a mature vs juvenile  secondary xylem library. altogether,  <dig> clones were obtained and sequenced from both sides of the cloning site. a total of  <dig>  good quality sequences with an average length of  <dig> nt were obtained,  <dig> from the jm library and  <dig> from the mj library. the sequences were deposited in the embl-ebi nucleotide database .

est assembly
the assembly of the  <dig>  good quality sequences described above together with the ests and core nucleotide sequences publicly available in the genbank and embl databases, generated  <dig>  unigenes, comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. among these, we discarded all sequences whose size was below  <dig> nt and selected for further analysis only the  <dig>  unigenes  which contained at least one sequence originating from one of our libraries including two ssh libraries previously obtained in the laboratory, i.e. a secondary xylem vs secondary phloem ssh library   <cit>  and a secondary xylem vs leaves ssh library   <cit> . the rationale for this was to select a subset of secondary xylem-related sequences that we called 'eucawood' . the eucawood unigenes had an average length of  <dig> nt and a size distribution as shown in figure  <dig>  to mine this new eucalyptus genome resource, we have developed a publicly accessible database that supports multiple queries on the eucawood unigenes and their functional annotation  <cit> .

the venn diagram in figure 2a illustrates the number of unigenes shared between the cdna library  and each of the four different ssh libraries. interestingly, most of the contigs containing sequences originating from at least one of the ssh libraries  were not present in the xylcdna library. only  <dig> contigs contained ests originating from the xylcdna and one of the ssh libraries . this little overlap confirms the utility of combining cdna and ssh libraries to identify new genes expressed in eucalyptus secondary xylem: the ssh libraries contain many clones not recovered from the total cdna library.

sequence comparisons with other species
homology searches were conducted using the blastx program  <cit>  to compare the "eucawood" unigene set with predicted protein and gene model databases for arabidopsis, poplar and rice, four plant species whose genomes have been sequenced  <cit> . these homology searches allowed us to assess the overlap between the eucawood unigenes and the protein sequence databases of these three model plants . approximately 55% of the unigenes  matched sequences occurring in all three species and 65%  matched sequences in at least one of these three species. the highest number of hits were obtained with the two woody angiosperms, i.e. poplar  and grapevine , followed by arabidopsis  and rice  predicted protein sequences. interestingly,  <dig> unigenes matched only against poplar and/or grapevine sequences, the only woody species whose genomes have been sequenced so far . most of these  <dig> unigenes corresponded to unknown proteins,  <dig> of them only matched predicted proteins of vitis vinifera,  <dig> had no other hit than gene models from poplar at an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig>   <dig> were common to poplar and grapevine. further investigation is needed to verify whether these latter sequences correspond to genes specifically expressed during wood formation in trees.

functional annotation
to further allocate protein annotations to the eucawood unigenes, blastx searches were performed against the uniref <dig> database  <cit> . go terms  <cit>  associated with the best uniref <dig> hit were then automatically assigned to the corresponding eucawood unigenes. functional annotation data are presented in additional file  <dig> as well as in the public eucawood database  <cit> . overall,  <dig>   unigenes produced matches to proteins in uniref <dig>  a total of  <dig>  go terms were allocated to  <dig>  unigenes, filed under 'biological process' , 'molecular function'  and 'cellular component'  . the vast majority of the  <dig>  go terms allocated to biological process genes fell under the categories 'metabolism'  and 'cellular process'  . the large proportion of unigenes involved in metabolic and biosynthetic processes confirms that differentiating secondary xylem is a very active tissue with a high metabolic rate. a large number of the terms allocated to 'molecular function' were in genes in the subcategories 'catalytic activity'  and 'binding'  . the most represented activities in catalytic activity were transferases , hydrolases  and oxidoreductases . the most abundant binding activites were nucleotide binding , iron binding , nucleic acid binding  and protein binding .

in a parallel annotation approach, we related the best uniref <dig> hit of every unigene to the pfam database  <cit>  in order to identify protein families and domains in the eucawood unigene set. a total of  <dig>  unigenes  were assigned at least one pfam identifier  and, overall,  <dig> pfam protein families and domains were represented among eucawood unigenes. remarkably, pfam ids related to signal transduction and cell wall metabolism formed the majority of the  <dig> most abundant protein families . these pfam matches showed that the most abundant protein families in the eucawood unigene set were also among the most represented in comparable studies with other plant species  <cit> . similar examination of the various protein families represented in the subtractive libraries  revealed a completely different pattern from that of the eucawood dataset, in which the large majority of the unigenes originate from the xylcdna library . eucawood unigenes containing ests from jm or mj libraries produced matches with  <dig> and  <dig> different protein families, respectively, including only five families common to both jm and mj libraries. among these  <dig> protein families, only seven appeared among the  <dig> most abundant families in the eucawood dataset. the pfam annotation of the uniref <dig> matches confirmed the little overlap between both libraries at the protein family level with only five common pfam ids.

finally,  <dig>   of eucawood unigenes produced no match against uniref <dig>  arabidopsis, poplar, grapevine or rice proteinsand were therefore considered as 'no hits' at e value ≤ e- <dig> . the average length of the "no hits" was remarkably shorter than that of the unigenes showing at least one blastx hit . consistent with this, the percentage of unigenes shorter than  <dig> nt was much higher among the 'no hits' than among the 'hits' . the opposite was also true for unigenes longer than  <dig> nt: the percentage of unigenes longer than  <dig> nt was much lower among the "no hits" than among the "hits" . the "no hits" group is enriched in 3' sequences, which are usually less conserved than those upstream in the gene.

cell wall-related genes
one of the crucial stages in xylem differentiation is the formation of the secondary cell wall, which is largely composed of cellulose, lignin and hemicelluloses together with other less abundant polysaccharides and structural proteins  <cit> . we therefore mined the eucawood unigene set for genes involved in lignin biosynthesis, carbohydrate and cell wall metabolism. we performed blastx searches using both the cell wall navigator   <cit> , and the maizewall databases  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> eucawood unigenes matched cell wall-related genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> hits with cwn and maizewall, respectively . among those,  <dig> were common to both databases, and  <dig> were found only in maizewall representing altogether the totality of the  <dig> categories described in this database. most of the hits found only in maizewall were secondary cell wall-related genes including phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthetic genes.

lignin biosynthesis genes
all the gene families involved in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway were represented in the eucawood dataset including  <dig> unigenes  with similarities to the set of lignin biosynthetic genes identified in arabidopsis by raes et al  <cit> . the eucawood set contained three distinct genes encoding hydroxycinnamoyl-coa:shikinimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase  suggesting that hct in eucalyptus is encoded by a small gene family as in poplar  <cit>  rather than a single hct gene, as in arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly, eight atp-binding cassette  transporters were present among eucawood unigenes, which might be involved in the transport of the lignin monomers to the cell wall through direct membrane pumping  <cit> . the molecular mechanism by which monolignols are incorporated into the lignin polymer is thought to involve key oxidation steps catalyzed by laccases and peroxidases  <cit> . six putative laccases were found among the eucawood unigenes, one of which was most similar to tt10/atlac <dig>  which has recently been proven to play a role in lignin synthesis  <cit> . three of these six unigenes were similar to irx12/lac <dig>  a gene involved in cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . the expression of irx12/lac <dig> might be regulated by atmyb26/male sterile <dig>  a myb transcription factor involved in secondary thickening of the anthers in arabidopsis  <cit> . eight eucawood unigenes were annotated as encoding peroxidases. three of them are homologues of atper <dig> and atper <dig>  two proteins whose precise biochemical functions remain elusive but which have been located in the cell wall  <cit> .

carbohydrate active enzymes and cell wall metabolism genes
the three-step process of cellulose biosynthesis was represented within the eucawood unigenes set  <cit> . three sucrose synthases  were found: one was similar to atsus <dig> whereas the other two were similar to atsus <dig>  <cit> . in addition, five unigenes homologous to members of the cellulose synthase  multigene family were also found that correspond to the egcesa1-egcesa <dig> genes recently described in e. grandis  <cit> . egcesa <dig>  egcesa <dig> and egcesa <dig> are specifically expressed during secondary cell wall biosynthesis, whereas expression of egcesa <dig> and egcesa <dig> is linked to the synthesis of primary cell wall. two unigenes similar to korrigan  proteins were alsoretrieved from eucawood. several studies have proven the importance of kor proteins in the formation of the plant cell wall in various species. for instance, arabidopsis irx <dig> and kor <dig> mutations, which map to the same gene, both affect secondary growth  <cit> .

the eucawood set also contained unigenes with homologies to arabidopsis proteins dedicated to hemicellulose and pectin biosynthesis including three putative cellulose synthase-like genes, thought to be involved in the synthesis of the backbone structures of mannans, glucomannans and galactomannans  <cit> . we also found eight unigenes similar to udp-xylose synthases, one to udp-xylose epimerase, two to β-xylosidases, one to glucuronic acid epimerase, two to pectin esterases, four to pectate lyases and four to polygalacturonases.

several unigenes similar to other gene families thought to be involved in cell wall formation were also found. two unigenes were similar to pttgh19a, which encodes a chitinase-like protein highly expressed during poplar secondary cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . mutation of two genes similar to pttgh19a in arabidopsis  caused deficient biosynthesis and incorporation of cellulose into the cell wall, as well as ectopic lignin deposition and aberrant cell shapes with incomplete cell walls  <cit> .

genes encoding proteins involved in loosening and rearrangement of the cell wall were also present among the eucawood unigenes, including, for instance, two expansin genes. expansins are thought to directly promote cell expansion by hydrolysing noncovalent bonds between cellulose and hemicelluloses in the cell wall  <cit> . the action of expansins is facilitated by xyloglucan endotransglycosylases /hydrolases , also known as xths, which incorporate and modify xyloglucans into the cell wall  <cit> . xth proteins are members of the glycosyl hydrolase  family  <dig>  which is the most abundant carbohydrate-metabolising enzyme group among the eucawood matches in the cwn database, represented by  <dig> unigenes. a total of  <dig> gene models belonging to the gh <dig> family have been recorded in the genome of poplar  <cit> .

whereas carbohydrates and lignin constitute the bulk of cell wall materials, structural proteins also form a network that contributes to the architecture and functionality of the cell wall. this is the case for fasciclin-like proteins , a subgroup of arabinogalactan proteins involved in processes such as growth and cell proliferation. five flas were identified in the eucawood unigene set. all five are similar to atfla <dig> and atfla <dig>  whose expression is linked to secondary cell wall biosynthesis and maturation  <cit> .

transcription factors
given the importance of transcriptional regulation during wood formation, we carried out blastx searches comparing the eucawood unigene set with the plant transcription factor database   <cit>  and the database of arabidopsis transcription factors   <cit> . a total of  <dig> unigenes  had at least one hit in either database. ptfd and datf produced  <dig> and  <dig> hits respectively, with  <dig> unigenes having a hit in both databases . interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> ptfd hits corresponded to poplar sequences, whereas only  <dig> matched arabidopsis and  <dig> matched rice proteins. the  <dig> hits identified  <dig> transcription factor families, some of which are known to play a role in secondary growth and wood formation  <cit> . the 'c2h <dig> zinc-finger' family was the most frequently represented among the eucawood unigenes, with  <dig> putative members, followed by the myb and nac families, each represented by  <dig> putative unigenes. a number of plant myb proteins, including eucalyptus and other woody species, have already been proven to regulate the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds, including lignin  <cit> . putative orthologs of nac factors known to play a role in xylem differentiation were found among the eucawood sequences. for instance, the nac secondary wall thickening promoting factor genes nst <dig> and nst <dig> are implicated in the formation and thickening of secondary wall in arabidopsis  <cit> ; anac012/snd <dig>  a member of the iib group of the nac family, has recently been described as a key regulator of xylary fiber development  <cit> . a putative ortholog of the negative regulator of both secondary cell wall synthesis and programmed cell death, anac104/xnd <dig>  <cit> , was also present in eucawood. three unigenes resemble lim transcription factors, some of which have been shown to regulate the expression of lignin biosynthetic genes  <cit> . in fact, cg <dig> is similar to eclim <dig> from e. camaldulensis, which shares 86% homology with nicotiana tabacum ntlim <dig>  suppression of ntlim1expression caused the downregulation of lignin biosynthesis genes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase   <cit> .

the auxin-inducible factor  and auxin-response factor  families were represented by four eucawood unigenes. one is similar to iaa <dig> and its closely related bdl/iaa <dig>  whose mutation disrupts the normal cell and tissue organization along the apical-basal axis resulting in discontinuous and reduced vascular formation  <cit> .

six homedomain-leucine zipper proteins were present in the eucawood dataset. among them, one contig  is similar to athb <dig> and athb <dig>  members of class iii . these proteins are involved in vascular development and wood formation and share antagonistic functions with other hd-zipiii proteins such as revoluta, phabulosa , and phavoluta  <cit> . a putative ortholog of phb, known to positively regulate the size of the vascular bundles, was also found in the eucawood set  <cit> .

core xylem genes
expression profiling has been used in several studies to report sets of genes differentially expressed during xylem development, notably in arabidopsis  <cit> . comparison of the eucawood unigenes with sets of genes expressed during xylem differentiation in arabidopsis, revealed four candidate genes common to all the above-mentioned studies. they encode irx <dig> , cobl4/irx <dig> , irx <dig>  as well as a protein of unknown function . these four genes belong to a group of  <dig> arabidopsis genes defined by ko and collaborators as 'core xylem-specific genes' in their comparative transcriptome analysis  <cit> .

in silico identification of simple sequence repeat  markers
genomic ssr markers or microsatellites have already been developed in eucalyptus species  <cit> , however, to the best of our knowledge, only one very recent paper was dedicated to est-ssrs  <cit> . to mine the eucawood dataset for est-ssrs, we looked for di- and tri-nucleotide repeats stretching for at least  <dig> nt and also tetra- to hexa-nucleotides repeated at least three times. a total of  <dig> putative microsatellites were thus found in  <dig> eucawood unigenes . that is,  <dig> % of the eucawood unigenes contain at least one putative ssr. this agrees with the frequency of ssr-ests found in other dicotyledonous species, which ranges from  <dig> – <dig> %  <cit> .

tri-nucleotide repeats  were the most abundant motifs , followed by di-nucleotide repeats . this is consistent with most similar studies of monocots as well as dicots  <cit> . among the tnrs, the most abundant motifs were aag/aga/gaa/ctt/ttc/tct  representing  <dig> % of tnrs and  <dig> % of all ssrs. the dnr the most represented was ag/ga/ct/tc , which accounted for  <dig> % of all dnrs and  <dig> % of all ssrs. these motifs have also been found to be the predominant dnrs and tnrs among the est-ssrs in more than  <dig> plant species  <cit> .

the eucawood database
eucawood  <cit>  is a mysql database allowing four types of queries through a web interface consisting of check boxes and pull-down menus. query  <dig> is a library filter query allowing retrieval of all unigenes or a selection of them from the user-specified libraries. est assembly, blast hits against several databases , go and pfam annotations can also be retrieved. query  <dig> retrieves unigenes by name , key words, pfam or go annotations, or hits in blast . query  <dig> allows blast searches  for a user-specified sequence  in the eucawood database. query  <dig> gives access to a tree view showing the number of unigenes by go terms.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the sequencing, assembly and annotation of approximately  <dig>  ests derived from a normalised full-length secondary xylem cdna library as well as subtractive libraries. our data demonstrate the benefit for large-scale gene/est discovery of using normalized libraries that minimize redundancies and increase the representation of the different genes expressed in a chosen tissue. they also illustrate the advantage of sequencing, in parallel, ests from subtracted libraries, which are enriched in clones not found in cdna libraries and are a valuable source of new genes. the combination of a normalised secondary xylem library and subtractive libraries allowed us to assemble a large set of wood-related eucalyptus unigenes, called eucawood, thus substantially increasing the representation of eucalyptus ests available in public databases. the number of sequences available for this economically important genus has increased significantly during the past months  <cit>  but is still low in comparison to other forest tree species such as poplar or pine. the major part of this new data set is composed of short sequences whose number is expected to increase dramatically in the future thanks to the development of the high-throughput '454' technology  <cit> .

the eucawood dataset currently provides the most comprehensive list of unigenes dedicated to wood formation in the genus eucalyptus. we have provided a public database supporting multiple queries that will be a particularly valuable resource for the correct annotation of genomic sequences and for the functional analysis of genes and their products. the most immediate application of the eucawood unigene set reported in this study is the development of a wood reference microarray for eucalyptus.

finally, the eucawood dataset is also a valuable source of microsatellite markers as  <dig> est-ssrs were identified from it. the usefulness of these est-derived ssrs is superior to that of the genomic ssrs especially in looking for markers for important traits using the gene candidate approach. they are also usually more conserved and, therefore, may be easily transferred between species. the microsatellites reported for all these unigenes might be used to produce genetic maps, providing resources, for instance, for trait/gene association and candidate gene identification for wood quality traits.
