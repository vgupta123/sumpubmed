BACKGROUND
the binding of transcription factors  to dna sequences is an essential step in genome regulation. in parallel with the quick development of high-throughput methods for measuring genome-wide protein-dna interaction . many state-of-art computer programs  have been developed to identify tf binding motifs. nevertheless, several questions remain in the field, such as how to distinguish true tf-dna binding  from non-specific tf-dna binding . here the functional tf binding site is defined as the promoter region of a gene that, bound by a tf, is a true regulatory target ; the non-functional tf binding site refers to a non-specific tf-dna binding such as a tf that is bound to the promoter region of a gene but does not regulate the gene expression. finding the true regulatory targets of a tf based on the present technology is a challenge  <cit> , which has inspired many researchers over the past several years to seek help from computational solutions such as integrative modeling of mrna expression data and chip-chip data  <cit> , biophysical modeling of orthologous promoter sequences  <cit> , predicting of functionality of protein-dna interactions  <cit> , and distinguishing direct versus indirect tf-dna interactions  <cit>  by integrating diverse information.

although some of the previous studies considered the effect of nucleosomes on tf-dna interactions , most of them ignored an important aspect that is also closely associated with functional tf binding, that is, changes in chromatin structure are affected by histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation  <cit> . in a few recent papers  <cit> , the effect of histone modifications on protein-dna interactions was emphasized. especially, several excellent bioinformatics studies revealed importance of considering histone modification information, in computational algorithms, for identifying new regulatory elements  <cit>  and predicting promoters and enhancers in the human and mouse genomes  <cit> . however, no conclusive remarks were made to address the associations between histone modification and functional tf binding. this may be due to the ongoing debate on models of the functions of histone modification  <cit> . currently, three major models have been proposed to explain the role of histone modification in genome regulation: 1) charge neutralization  <cit> , by which histone modification can relax chromatin structure because of neutralizing positive charges on dna; 2) histone code  <cit> , by which combinatory histone modifications can regulate downstream gene functions; and 3) signaling pathway  <cit> , by which multiple histone modifications can provide bi-stability and robustness through feedback loops. motivated by this unsolved question, a systematic study of associations between tf-dna binding and histone modification in yeast was carried out by integrative analysis of diverse datasets  <cit> .

methods
pre-processing of datasets
chip-chip experimental data in rich medium conditions of  <dig> yeast tfs was obtained from the work of harbison et al.  <cit> . yeast nucleosome occupancy in normal condition was taken from lee et al.  <cit> . the histone acetylation dataset was from kurdistani et al.  <cit> ; the dataset contained acetylation levels on  <dig> histone lysines in both yeast promoter and the open reading frame  . because the measured histone modifications in any given promoter are affected by the rate of that region being occupied by nucleosome  <cit> , the  <dig> acetylation levels were normalized by the nucleosome occupancy  measured by lee et al.  <cit> . more specifically, the average of h <dig> and h <dig> histone levels was computed within each probe then the histone acetylation level of that probe was divided by the corresponding mean nucleosome occupancy. additionally, histone modification data from pokholok et al.  <cit>  was used, which included acetylation levels on three histone lysines , methylation levels on five histone lysines , nucleosome occupancy , and histone acetyltransferase  occupancy data under normal condition. here the histone modification signals were also normalized by the local nucleosome occupancy as described in the previous dataset. since array difference in genome-wide coverage , the above-mentioned two histone modifications datasets were separately analyzed. all datasets were transformed to z-scores before further data analysis was performed.

gene assignment, putative functional binding target and data analysis
based on the original gene annotation tables from  <cit> , an in-house perl script file was used to map nucleosome occupancy and histone modification levels to gene and the corresponding promoter region, in which if multiple probes are assigned to the same gene or promoter region then we use their mean value. information on computationally inferred functional tf binding sites and non-functional ones for  <dig> yeast tfs at normal condition was taken from publication by gao et al.  <cit> . here tfs with less than five probes overlapped between the binding data and the histone modification data were excluded. to examine possible correlations between histone modifications and transcription factor binding, a two-tailed t-test was used to quantify the difference in mean between the tf binds and the histone modification  <cit>  for both the functional binding probes  and non-functional ones , respectively. in general, the t-test was used to score the difference between average tf binding affinity  of predefined groups of probes , and that of all other probes on the array. subsequently, the t-values were clustered  <cit>  and visualized  <cit>  in a color-coded heat map to uncover tf binds  enriched in the probed regions forming a given group. the same procedure was successfully applied in a number of earlier studies  <cit> . finally, to evaluate the robustness of the t-test, the rank-sum test was applied on the same datasets, and then the log <dig> transformed p-values were displayed in the heat map.

protein-histone modification interaction networks
in order to investigate possible correlation between the histone modification at orf and the tf binding to the corresponding promoter, a computational strategy was used to build a protein-histone modification interaction network: 1) for the binding targets of each of  <dig> tfs from  <cit> , enrichment of proteins  binding to the promoter was tested, such as by performing a two-tailed t-test for selected functional  binding sites versus the rest of the binding sites in the yeast genome  <cit> ; 2) then, for the binding targets of the above-mentioned  <dig> tfs, the same t-tests were used to evaluate the histone modification changes  at the corresponding orf; 3) subsequently, the t-values from the previous tests were combined together, more specifically, the histone modifications at the orf of functional  binding sites were combined with the enrichment of tf binding at the corresponding promoter; 4) in each of above two newly complied datasets, one for functional binding sites and the other for non-functional ones, proteins  were grouped into  <dig> clusters by using a published computational approach  <cit>  that combines the stress function, neuron gas algorithm and k-nearest neighbour method, where the number of protein clusters was automatically estimated by the stress function; 5) finally, gaussian graphical models  <cit>  were applied on the centers of  <dig> clusters for inferring the protein-histone modification interaction network. in predicted network, the nodes represent  <dig> protein clusters and the edges indicate associations between a pair of nodes, where the strength of interactions is stated by the partial correlation coefficient. for every node that is connected to the network, its representative proteins are labeled.

bayesian neural networks
binary bayesian neural classification networks is a supervised neural network, the output of which is a function y of the input x and of the parameters w; the architecture of net is denoted by a. the output function y is bound between  <dig> and  <dig> such as a probability p, where t are the targets in a dataset which are binary classification labels . here we trained the network with one hidden layer to perform classification tasks. the non-linear 'sigmoid' function at the hidden layer gives the neural networks greater computational flexibility than a standard linear regression model  <cit> . the objective function of the networks is   

where      

ew is regularization, and i and m are the number of parameters and the number of input data, respectively. based on bayes' theorem, a posterior distribution of the model parameters w is   

where h represents the model hypothesis space such as network structure and regularization, m is a probability framework of the objective function described in equation , and zm is a normalization factor. by using a gaussian approximation to the posterior probability, we minimize objective function  and determine the re-estimation formulas for hyperparameter Î± according to the weight assumptions ew. a detailed description of computational implementation of bayesian neural networks by using the gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution is available in previous publications  <cit> .

using bayesian neural networks to find functional protein-dna binding
as already discussed in the previous section, bayesian neural networks is a supervised non-linear model, which has several advantages  <cit>  when applied to classification tasks: 1) the computational algorithm is robust  <cit> , 2) it can learn from the data without any pre-assumption, 3) its non-linear feature can be applied to model any real-world complex relationships. thus, bayesian neural networks was used to classify functional and non-functional binding sites  <cit>  based on histone modification levels at the orfs. first, we trained a classifier on the training data for each tf via bayesian neural networks  <cit>  , then the trained classifier was applied on independent test data for recording the percentage of correct classifications and total number of correct classifications. to avoid the bias that may be introduced by the selection of training and test data, we randomly divided the half-available binding sites into the training and the test set, respectively. the random splitting was repeated  <dig> times for each tf, and the reported classification accuracy is the mean of percentage of correct classifications  of  <dig> randomly selected test datasets. a corresponding 10-fold cross validation was also performed.

RESULTS
histone acetylation 
among the non-functional binding sites in figure  <dig>  there is an almost constant acetylation level across all histone lysines, which may be either high or low; for the functional binding sites, however, the equilibrium of the histone acetylation levels on the different lysines is broken, which results in a tf-specific perturbation of acetylation levels. for example, the functional binding sites of fhl <dig>  show very high acetylation levels on h3k <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but relatively no acetylation changes on h2k <dig> and 16; on the other hand, the functional binding sites of nrg <dig>  display high acetylation levels on h4k <dig> and  <dig> but low acetylation levels on h3k <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and h2k <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. from the literature  <cit> , we know that the effect of histone acetylation is dependent on the specific histone lysines that may initiate different downstream functions, such as the binding of additional histone acetyltransferases , modification of the chromatin structure, and recruitment of a particular transcription factor or nucleosome remodeling complex.

nevertheless, figure  <dig> also shows that the discriminative power of histone modifications is much less clear for other tfs . of the above-mentioned six tfs, the first four are related to the yeast cell cycle and the other two are usually not functional under growth conditions  <cit> . it suggests that for certain tfs, we need to consider more diverse histone modification information, such as histone decetylation and methylation levels, in order to distinguish the functional binding sites from the non-functional ones. taken together, the results indicate the tf-specific histone acetylation at yeast orf might be used as a biomarker of functional protein binding.

histone modification 
in the above analysis, only ~ <dig> promoters and ~ <dig> orfs were studied. next the t-test was performed on a high-resolution microarray data  <cit>  that tiled the entire yeast genome , which contains histone modification data of ~ <dig> orfs and ~ <dig> promoters. after removing tfs with less than  <dig> binding targets,  <dig> of the  <dig> tfs from gao et al.  <cit>  were used in the study. for those selected tfs, a search of motif similarity matches, by using stamp tool  <cit> , shows proteins do not bind to the same sites . figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> present the clustering of the t-values  for orf and promoter, respectively. both figures indicate a clear separation of histone modification levels, as well as of hats occupancy  between the functional binding sites and the non-functional ones for almost half of all tfs tested . such effect may be more easily seen at the orf than that at the promoter. based on the same data, a similar test  was also performed with both t-test and rank-sum test. the log <dig> transformed p-values of the above two tests are displayed in heap maps, which show that histone modification levels do differ between the functional binding sites and the non-functional ones .

in figure  <dig>  acetylation levels on histone lysines of both fhl <dig> and nrg <dig> bear a similar trend as those observed in figure  <dig>  for the above-mentioned two tfs, a similar variation at three methylation levels on the histone lysines  was also observed, and the three methylation sites on the histones are involved in the activation of transcription  <cit>  as usually the acetylation on the histone lysines is. interestingly, for both cell cycle related tfs  and tfs that are not functional under growth conditions , the discriminative power of histone modifications in figure  <dig> is much stronger than that in figure  <dig>  this may be caused by histone acetyltransferase and methylation levels  in figure  <dig>  thus, the new results support our previous hypothesis from figure 1: the functional regulation of different tfs is controlled by the histone modifications on different lysines; the difference in histone modifications is much stronger at the orf than at the promoter; in particular, the more diverse histone modification information, the stronger discriminative power it has.

a protein-histone modification interaction network 
having shown a difference in histone modification patterns between functional binding sites and non-functional ones at yeast orf  for almost half of all tfs tested, we investigated whether there is a correlation between the histone modifications at the orf and the tf bindings to the corresponding promoter. this was achieved by a computational strategy that is detailed in the method section. in brief, first protein activity profiles  were computed, at both functional and non-functional binding sites of  <dig> selected tfs  <cit> ; the protein activities were then grouped into  <dig> clusters  by a published algorithm  <cit> ; subsequently, gaussian graphical models  <cit>  were applied on the centers of  <dig> clusters for inferring the protein-histone modification interaction network. figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> figure s <dig> show the inferred protein-histone modification interaction networks  for the functional tf binding sites and the non-functional ones, respectively.

in figure  <dig>  the functional tf binding, several interesting correlations were found between protein binding to the promoter and histone modification at the corresponding orf: for example, 1) at the center of the network, two clusters  are strongly connected to each other , while being also associated with three other clusters  that contain histone h <dig> and histone acetyltransferase; 2) cluster  <dig>  is negatively correlated  with cluster  <dig> , but cluster  <dig>  is positively associated with both cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig> . additionally, much histone crosstalk was observed: for instance, 1) cluster  <dig>  is negatively correlated with cluster  <dig> , but cluster  <dig>  is positively associated with the same cluster; 2) cluster  <dig> is also correlated with cluster  <dig> where we found both histone methylation and histone acetylation ; 3) cluster  <dig> is connected with cluster  <dig> where three of five proteins are a chromatin remodeling complex  that contributes to both nucleosome formation and regulation of histone gene transcription. in summary, the inferred network reveals a number of interesting findings, such as evidence for histone crosstalk, data suggesting that different proteins are affected by different histone modifications, and data supporting that histone modifications are negatively correlated with nucleosome density, while being positively associated with both the chromatin remodeling complex and the binding of fhl <dig> and rap <dig> to the promoter.

in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  the non-functional tf binding, all histone modifications plus the nucleosome  and hats  occupancies are grouped in the same cluster . in other words, there is no difference in histone modification changes across the  <dig> yeast tfs when tf binds to dna but does not function. particularly, many interesting protein-histone modification interactions in figure  <dig> are not present at here: for example, cluster  <dig> neither directly interacts with the chromatin remodeling complex nor is it associated with the binding of rap <dig> and fhl <dig> to the promoter, although the two proteins are still highly connected to each other . this suggests that the majority of protein-histone modification interactions will disappear if the protein binds to the promoter region of a gene but does not regulate the gene expression.

classification of functional and non-functional binding sites by using measured histone modifications at the orfs
the above data has so far shown that histone modification at orfs may be used to predict the functional binding sites at promoters , and that the tf-specific modification of histone lysines disappears at the non-functional binding sites . thus, it was deemed interesting to investigate how reliable the histone modifications at orfs are in distinguishing functional binding sites from non-functional ones at the promoters. the hypothesis was tested on two datasets: one containing only  <dig> acetylation levels from kurdistani et al  with nucleosome occupancy from lee et al. at orfs, the other including more diverse histone modifications from pokholok et al. . based on the above-mentioned two datasets, bayesian neural networks was used to perform the classification and the mpcc on the test data sets  was reported, table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> table s1a. for results of 10-fold cross validations, please refer to additional file  <dig>  tables s1b, s <dig> and figures s5b, s6b.

the calculations are completed by applying bayesian neural networks on  <dig> randomly selected test datasets , which include diverse histone modifications ; tf name with bold text represents yeast cell cycle related tfs  <cit> , and tf rank order is based on mean percentage of correct classification in  <dig> test datasets.

for the first dataset, additional file  <dig> table s1a shows mpcc of  <dig> randomly selected test datasets, with  <dig> tfs  showing a good prediction rate on the test set  but with the other  <dig> tfs  classifying poorly . among the poorly classified tfs, ~69%  are associated with yeast cell cycle. for the second dataset , a clear improvement of the classification accuracy is observed: for example,  <dig> of the total  <dig> tfs  had mpcc > = 70% and the trained classifier only tested poorly on  <dig> tfs . here ~67% of the tfs with lower classification accuracies  are tfs related to the yeast cell cycle. in brief, for the first training data that contains only histone acetylation information, good classification accuracy was achieved for around one third of all tfs tested ; however, for the second dataset that includes both histone methylation and histone acetlylation features, almost half of all tfs tested were well classified by histone modifications . additional file  <dig> figures s5a and s6a show the mean confusion matrix and the mean classification performance , respectively, of  <dig> randomly selected test datasets  <cit> .

through a closer look  at the mean histone modification levels at the orfs of the top  <dig> ranked tfs , two similar regulation mechanisms as previously been seen in figure  <dig> were identified. first, nrg <dig>  a transcriptional repressor, shows higher nucleosome density at the orfs of functional binding targets than at those of non-functional ones, although it has much lower histone modification levels at the orfs of functional binding sites than at those of non-functional ones; in contrast, the other four tfs  show opposite histone modification activities. second, h <dig> acetylation levels and h3k79me <dig> are only depleted in nrg <dig> and rlm <dig>  while h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> are only enriched in rlm <dig> and hir <dig>  overall, this suggests that there are tf-specific histone modifications at the orfs of functional binding sites, and that the regulation of different tfs is controlled by the histone modifications on different lysines.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
two histone modification datasets  <cit>  were investigated here. both results confirm there is a distinct pattern of histone modifications between functional tf binding sites and non-functional ones for almost half of all tfs tested . for example, 1) for the functional tf binding sites, different tfs modify acetylation  levels on the different histone lysines; 2) for the non-functional tf binding sites, the acetylation  levels on different histone lysines are almost constant; 3) the difference in histone modifications between the functional tf binding sites and the non-functional ones is stronger at the orf region than that at the promoters, which is also becoming clear when we directly compare the mean histone modification changes between the two groups ; and 4) a protein-histone modification interaction network can only be inferred from the functional protein binding targets. in summary, both the histone crosstalk and protein-histone modification interactions may play important roles in functional tf binding since many of them disappear under non-functional conditions.

in particular, the discriminative power of histone modifications is much greater with histone modifications at orfs than at the promoter. the finding is backed by several lines of evidence in the literature. first, in yeast, the methylation levels on histone lysines are either positively or negatively correlated with transcription rates, and the main peaks of enrichment for methylation are often within the orfs   <cit> . second, although acetylation at many sites correlates with transcription rate, some of them  at yeast intergenic regions do not correlate well with transcription  <cit> . third, in different human cell types, histone modification levels and gene expression are very well correlated, and the main peaks of enrichment for those important modifications are within the orfs   <cit> . finally, in both the yeast and fruit fly genomes, experimental observations have shown that the enrichment of h3k36me <dig> levels at the orfs can be used to distinguish different chromatin types  <cit> . thus, the high levels of orf enrichment for histone modification, especially the methylation levels, could potentially reflect the activity of protein-dna binding in the promoter region  <cit> . in general, all the above-mentioned molecular mechanisms support the hypothesis that orf histone modification data are better associated with tf binding at the promoter than the promoter histone modification data, further investigation is still needed to determine and verify the underlying mechanism.

in addition, bayesian neural networks was used to train a classifier from the training histone data, and then the trained classifier was applied to an independent set of histone data in order to predict the functional tf binding sites. the results are encouraging  because almost half of the tested tfs could reach a prediction accuracy of ~70%, although only eight histone modifications were considered in the training set. in table  <dig>  especially, among the top  <dig> ranked tfs, we observed tf-specific histone modification at the orfs of functional binding sites , which suggests that the functional regulation of different tfs is controlled by the histone modifications on different lysines . however, most of the currently examined histone modifications are associated with transcriptional activation  <cit> , and there is no information about the histone modifications of transcriptional silencing/repression  in the training data. therefore, the lack of information on certain histone modifications may cause the poor prediction rate for some tfs. for instance, in table  <dig>  ~67% of tfs with mpcc <70% are tfs related to yeast cell cycle; the cell cycle tfs are often associated with rpd <dig> target genes, and the rpd <dig> protein belongs to yeast histone deacetylases  that may play an important role in yeast cell cycle regulation  <cit> ; after excluding the cell cycle tfs from figure  <dig> and  <dig>  clustering analysis was performed again but the clustering patterns were not dramatically changed, additional file  <dig> figures s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. thus, results indicate that if the training data include more post-translational modifications of the histones , then the trained classifier will achieve a better prediction accuracy in the test data.

below is a brief description of the possible protein-histone modification interaction network from figure  <dig>  first, for correlations between protein binding to the promoter and histone modification at the corresponding orf, cluster  <dig>  has a strong negative association with cluster  <dig> , but cluster  <dig>  has a strong positive interaction with the same cluster, and cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig> are positively correlated to each other. the above mentioned interactions are consistent with the literature: for example, rap <dig>  opens chromatin  <cit>  to facilitate binding by other tfs such as gcn <dig>  and then the bound tf recruits hats , resulting in histone acetylation  <cit> ; fhl <dig> has been thought to interact with the histone acetylase esa <dig> and to activate transcription of proteins  <cit> ; by searching the biogrid database  <cit> , direct protein-protein interaction between rap <dig> and fhl <dig> was found, as well as interactions between rap <dig> and nine other proteins associated with hats , although fhl <dig> only interacted with one hat . additionally, both fhl <dig> and rap <dig> are known to actively participate in modifying chromatin structure  <cit>  and regulating acetylation/methylation levels on histone lysines  <cit> . thus, current literature supports the view that rap <dig> and fhl <dig> complement each other to control the chromatin-open and hat recruitment activities .

second, cluster  <dig>  is positively correlated with cluster  <dig> but cluster  <dig>  is negatively associated with the same cluster. in cluster  <dig>  both hats  and histone modifications for active genes  are found. therefore, the gene transcription rate is negatively correlated with the nucleosome density but positively associated with the binding of fhl <dig>  to the promoter region.

third, for histone crosstalk, cluster  <dig> is only connected with cluster  <dig> and cluster  <dig>  in cluster  <dig>  there are three histone modifications , which are less associated with the transcription rate than h3k9ac and h3k14ac  <cit> . in cluster  <dig>  three of five proteins are subunits of a hir complex , a nucleosome assembly complex that contributes to nucleosome formation. based on the biogrid database, hir complexes directly interact with at least  <dig> proteins  that are involved in chromatin remodeling, and  <dig> another proteins that are involved in histone modification . thus, at the end of a protein-histone modification interaction network, protein involved in chromatin remodeling, such as atp-dependent chromatin remodelers, may play a key role in generating new histone modifications, e.g., modification in the chromatin structure that may influence gene activity either positively or negatively  <cit> .

finally, from the inferred networks , a simplified diagram for protein-histone modification interactions can be drawn , where there are several feedback loops which match the description of providing bi-stability and robustness in signaling pathway rather than the regulation by combinatory histone modifications  <cit> . thus, the data suggests that a signaling pathway model  <cit>   may be more suited than the histone code  <cit>  to interpret the function of histone modifications in genome regulation. overall, the present study opens a new avenue for studying protein-dna interactions; histone modification levels at the orfs under different conditions may tell us whether a true protein-dna binding has occurred  <cit> , which differs significantly with the previous works  <cit> .
