BACKGROUND
according to the genealogical species concept, species are defined as multi-locus "genotypic clusters" that remain distinct even in the presence of gene flow among each other  <cit> . "hybridization is thus a normal feature of species biology"  <cit> . hybridization and its results, e.g., introgression, segregation of new types without backcrossing, and allopolyploidy, have long been speculated as major forces behind "evolutionary bursts"  <cit> . indeed, plant species and populations arisen from hybridization and polyploidy often exhibit more complicated patterns of variation than their progenitors, i.e., their diploid sister groups, and are ecologically divergent, presumably under local selection. furthermore, when gene flow is present between the diverged progenies or between the parental and daughter lineages, the genetic and phenotypic complexity of the populations could be enhanced. all these processes may increase species diversity and obliterate discrete separation lines between otherwise diverged taxa as observed in many angiosperm polyploid complexes  <cit> .

achillea millefolium agg.  is a highly polymorphic but clearly monophyletic polyploid species complex or aggregate. it is composed of outbreeding hemicryptophytic perennials widely distributed over the n hemisphere. five to seven diploid and 10- <dig> polyploid taxa can be defined in this complex  <cit> . autopolyploidy has been documented in the n american populations, which serve as textbook examples for plant ecotypic differentiation  <cit> . most of the eurasian polyploids, ranging from tetra- to octoploids, are either derived from primary hybridization between diploid progenitors or may be products of secondary introgression on the same or on different ploidy levels. this has created complex genetic and phenotypic variation patterns within a. millefolium agg.  <cit> . the relationships of the diploid species conform to a tree structure, whereas most of the polyploid taxa exhibit complex and reticulate relationships with each other and with the diploid species  <cit> .

achillea collina is a widely distributed tetraploid member of a. millefolium agg. in europe. it is morphologically intermediate between the relic diploids, a. setacea-2x in xeric and a. asplenifolia-2x in humid habitats, and often grows in close contact with either of them  <cit> . cytogenetic analyses and crossing experiments of a. asplenifolia and a. setacea have resulted in f <dig> and f <dig> generations with reduced vitality and fertility. thus, the two diploid species are separated by considerable intrinsic barriers. from their diploid f <dig> hybrid progeny, several spontaneous allotetraploid individuals could be obtained. they were morphologically quite similar to the wild species a. collina-4x, fertile, and could be crossed with the latter  <cit> . previous aflp analyses have suggested a. setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x as the most likely progenitors of a. collina-4x  <cit> . in the austrian province of burgenland, south of vienna, we found several natural hybrid swarms where either morphologically "typical" a setacea-2x or "typical" a. asplenifolia-2x come into contact with a. collina-4x. we suspect some 4x plants in these hybrid zones to be products of backcrosses from a. setacea-2x or a. asplenifolia-2x via unreduced egg cells to their assumed daughter species a. collina-4x. clarification of genetic relationships of these diploid and tetraploid individuals and populations should improve our understanding of the enormous species diversity and the complex patterns of variation in a. millefolium agg..

to resolve reticulate relationships and recent radiation, single- or low-copy nuclear genes are preferable because i) they can provide co-dominant molecular markers for identifying hybridization and/or introgressive events, ii) they often provide multiple unlinked loci with fast evolving introns, and are thus more informative than the plastid dna, iii) such low-copy nuclear loci are less susceptible than ribosomal genes to gene conversion, which can reduce or eliminate allelic heterozygosity. the major problem in utilizing low-copy nuclear genes is to distinguish orthologs from paralogs. only with orthologs, phylogenetic interpretations make sense  <cit> . in addition, pcr-recombination can also be a problem when sequencing nuclear genes, especially from polyploid genomes. when two partially homologous templates exist in one pcr reaction, an in vitro chimera could be formed from the non-identical templates. this can happen when amplifying members of multigene families or any locus from polyploid genomes  <cit> . by optimizing pcr conditions, the frequency of pcr recombination can be reduced  <cit> . nevertheless, data should be interpreted cautiously to avoid biased evolutionary interpretations due to artificially recombinant molecules  <cit> .

with large numbers of markers, the aflp method can help to obtain genome-wide perspectives about populations under processes influencing the entire genome, such as gene flow and genetic drift. therefore, this is a powerful tool in recognizing hybridization events  <cit> .

here we use sequences of two single-copy nuclear genes, the chloroplast-expressed glutamine synthase gene  and the cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase gene  as well as aflp data to demonstrate allopolyploid speciation and ongoing hybrid introgression by backcrossing between diploid progenitor and tetraploid progeny lineages in achillea millefolium agg..

RESULTS
genealogical relationships based on the nuclear gene sequences
amplifications for both the ncpgs and the pgic locus yielded a single band from each individual sample. the ncpgs haplotype sequences of the 2x individuals and populations group into two clades corresponding to the two diploid species , thus clearly belong to a set of single-copy orthologs. the pgic gene tree does not completely correspond to the divergence of the diploid species . this can be attributed to incomplete sorting of two ancestral pgic alleles in achillea millefolium agg.  or to introgression . therefore, all the pgic sequences studied here also belong to one orthologous gene lineage.

the original complete ncpgs data matrix contains  <dig> sequences  from  <dig> individuals of  <dig> studied populations and the outgroup a. ligustica. the final ncpgs gene tree  was built on  <dig> consensus sequences ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bps. the alignment contains  <dig> nucleotide positions, of which  <dig>  were included in the phylogenetic analysis containing  <dig> parsimony-informative characters.

the original complete pgic data set contains  <dig> sequences  from the same  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals analyzed for the ncpgs locus. the final pgic gene tree  was built on  <dig> consensus sequences ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> bps. the alignment contains  <dig> nucleotide positions, of which  <dig>  were included in the phylogenetic analysis containing  <dig> parsimony-informative characters.

a heuristic search retained  <dig> equally most parsimonious  trees  from the  <dig> consensus ncpgs sequences and  <dig> mp trees  from the  <dig> consensus pgic sequences. topologies of the mp and nj trees were broadly similar. figs.  <dig> and  <dig> show the 50% majority rule consensus mp trees. internal node supports  from both mp and nj methods were presented on the trees.

phylogenetic analyses were first conducted for the diploid species only . rooted by the central mediterranean achillea ligustica-2x, each of the gene trees contains two well supported clades: clade i corresponds to a. setacea-2x in both gene trees, and clade ii in the ncpgs tree to a. asplenifolia-2x only, whereas in the pgic tree, subclade iia  contains sequences not only of a. asplenifolia-2x, but also a few of a. setacea-2x . we interpret the haplotype group a <dig> orthologous to a <dig> and a <dig>  and designate a <dig> and a <dig> as polymorphic alleles of the pgic gene from the ancestral lineage of a. millefolium agg. .

in contrast to the diploid individuals and populations, the tetraploid a. collina and its suspected backcross hybrids in the polymorphic "mixed" populations show homeologous copies at both ncpgs and pgic loci. in most cases, different sequences from the same tetraploid individual plant were placed in different diploid clades .

aflp split network
three primer pairs generated a total of  <dig> clear and unambiguous aflp bands from  <dig> individuals of eight populations. out of the  <dig> bands,  <dig>  were polymorphic. the 4x-accessions have more bands  than the 2x ones . thirty-seven differences of  <dig> phenotypic comparisons were observed based on the  <dig> replicated individuals, thus the error rate is  <dig> %. fig.  <dig> shows a neighbor net of the  <dig> individuals studied by the aflp method. two major splits, highlighted by red and blue, correspond to a. setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x, respectively. the box formed by the semi-congruent blue and green splits indicates the hybrid status of a. collina-4x. the incompatible yellow and purple splits link the a. setacea Ã— collina-4x individuals from population ns <dig> to a. setacea on the one hand and to a. collina on the other, demonstrating backcross introgression between the latter two.

discussion
achillea setacea and a. asplenifolia are two diploid species of the monophyletic a. millefolium agg.  <cit> . they represent two extremes of morphological and ecological differentiation within this species aggregate, the former hairy, small, and adapted to xeric steppe environments, the latter tall, glabrous, and adapted to undisturbed wet environments. achillea setacea-2x is sporadically distributed from ne anatolia and se europe to the balkans, hungary, slovakia, moravia, austria and interior valleys of the alps, and in the north to s poland, e germany and the n czech rep; whereas, a. asplenifolia-2x occurs locally from bulgaria and hungary to e austria and the southern czech republic  <cit> . in the ncpgs gene tree, haplotype sequences of a. setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x group well into two clades corresponding to the two species , the pgic gene tree, however, does not completely correspond to the divergence of the diploid species  . our data clearly show that both the ncpgs and pgic genes are single-copy in achillea millefolium agg.. to explain the partial incongruence of the pgic gene tree with the divergence of the diploid species , two interpretations can be put forward: i) incomplete sorting of ancestrally polymorphic alleles, or ii) of introgression during secondary contact of the two diploid species. considering the current allelic distribution, the former interpretation is more likely as shown below.

assuming incomplete lineage sorting   <cit> , allele a <dig> might have been retained from an ancestor of a. millefolium agg. in some populations of the extant a. setacea  and in a. asplenifolia, but was apparently lost during the migration of a. setacea to the north and the west, e.g., in the ukrainean and austrian populations . allele a <dig>  which appears in a. asplenifolia, could have arisen from a <dig> after the divergence of this species in the pannonian area, where it has survived locally in lowland areas in hungary, bulgaria, austria, and moravia .

alternatively, one could also assume subclade iia of fig. 2a  to be the result of hybrid introgression from a. asplenifolia-2x into a. setacea-2x. this is unlikely considering the current geographic distribution of the two diploid species and the occurrence of allele a <dig> among populations of a. setacea-2x . however, the refugia of the two species may have been in closer proximity in se europe during the ice-ages, and they may have hybridized there. if so, allele a <dig> must have been lost from a. setacea-2x during its northward migration. but this scenario is again unlikely because there are no signs of hybrid introgression between a. asplenifolia-2x and a. setacea-2x throughout the pannonian area, where they often occur in close proximity. a clear separation of the two diploid species is also strongly suggested by the ncpgs gene tree . thus, we assume that two pgic alleles a <dig> and a <dig> existed already in the ancestral lineage and may have been sorted incompletely after the divergence of a. asplenifolia and a. setacea, while allele a <dig> has arisen within a. asplenifolia after its species separation .

in contrast to the clear genetic and morphological separation of achillea setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x, a. collina-4x is morphologically intermediate between these two diploid species and also linked by intermediates to other 4x-taxa of a. millefolium agg.. unlike the two relic diploid species, a. collina-4x has widely expanded in various mesic and open vegetation types from se and e to c europe and is much more aggressive in disturbed habitats. from experimental crosses between a. asplenifolia-2x and a. setacea-2x, synthetic allotetraploid and a. collina-like plants were produced and successfully backcrossed to natural a. collina-4x  <cit> . these early results were supported by aflp analyses which showed that species-specific bands of the two diploids are combined in a. collina-4x  <cit> .

the present sequence data from single-copy nuclear genes ncpgs and pgic  demonstrate that all the haplotype sequences of the diploid individuals or populations are grouped corresponding to the two species, achillea setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x respectively. in contrast, sequences of nearly all populations and many individuals of a. collina-4x  are placed among both the diploid achillea setacea and a. asplenifolia clades. therefore, homeologs of the nuclear single-copy genes in a. collina-4x demonstrate its allotetraploid origin. additional evidence for this conclusion comes from the aflp neighbor net . that many of the a. collina-4x individuals  harbor homoeologous gene copies  suggests at least partly disomic inheritance of this tetraploid species. its diploid progenitors must have been closely related to the extant a. setacea-2x and a. asplenifolia-2x, and probably have differentiated in se europe. their hybridization and the origin of an allotetraploid progeny may have taken place in the pannonian region, where their distribution areas still overlap.

with the establishment of a. collina-4x, a first cycle of hybridization and differentiation was completed. but was the further expansion of this young allotetraploid species accompanied by complete isolation from or by continued backcrossing with its diploid progenitor lineages? earlier experiments of crossing 2x- and 4x-taxa of the a. millefolium agg. never have produced 3x-hybrids but can occasionally gave rise to 4x-progeny via unreduced egg cells from the 2x side  <cit> . such unreduced gametes occur frequently in a. millefolium agg.  <cit> . in burgenland, austria, populations of a. setacea-2x, a. asplenifolia-2x and a. collina-4x grow in two areas about  <dig> km apart: southeast of rust and st. margarethen . ongoing gene flow may exist among their populations: polymorphic populations m <dig> and m <dig> with mixed ploidal levels of 2x and 4x were found in disturbed grassland surrounding the morphologically more typical a. setacea-2x population ns <dig> on natural steppe islands near st. margarethen, whilst ns <dig> itself also contains a few phenotypically intermediate 4x-plants. similarly, at the outer border zone of lake neusiedlersee near rust, in contact zones between a. asplenifolia-2x in natural humid meadows and a. collina-4x from adjacent disturbed grassland, 4x-plants with intermediate phenotype were found in populations r <dig>  r <dig> and ns <dig> . our study, especially the aflp network , suggests these 4x-plants result from backcrosses of the 2x-taxa to a. collina-4x via unreduced female gametes. the possibility of reverse gene flow from 4x to 2x will need a further critical study.

there are several other examples for ongoing hybridization between taxa on different ploidy levels in achillea: a contact zone between a. asplenifolia-2x and a. collina-4x, comparable to the one in austria, was studied in w hungary  <cit> . a. virescens is an allo-4x-species, which has arisen from hybridization between a. collina-4x and a. nobilis-2x. its backcrossing with a. collina-4x has been demonstrated in ne italy  <cit> . the yellow flowering se-european a. clypeolata-2x has formed an extensive 4x-hybrid swarm with a. collina-4x in bulgaria  <cit> . in addition, natural and experimental crosses between a. collina-4x and a. millefolium-6x are quite successful; via semifertile 5x-f <dig>  aneuploid-f <dig> and backcrosses they rapidly produce normal euploid 4x or 6x progeny and support gene flow between the two ploidy levels  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
combining all molecular and cytogenetic data , we conclude that most of the polyploid taxa in achillea millefolium agg. are allopolyploids or at least more or less strongly influenced by hybridization. polyploid taxa often occur in close contact with each other and with diploids. this not only makes hybridization between polyploid taxa at the same ploidy level omnipresent, but facilitates introgression between taxa on different ploidy levels. introgression of genetic material into diploid taxa, either from other diploid taxa or from polyploids, however, seems rare. hybrid swarms common in natural zones of contacts between different taxa lead to the great genetic and ecological differentiation and variation of the polyploid taxa in the a. millefolium species complex.
