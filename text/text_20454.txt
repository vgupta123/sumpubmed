BACKGROUND
it has been reported that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in long-lasting behavioural changes such as locomotor sensitization that are thought to be due to structural and functional changes in associated brain regions, particularly the nac  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that addictive drugs induce persistent and dynamic cellular and molecular modifications accompanied by distinct processes of drug addiction  <cit> . the complexity of drug-induced stable changes suggests that synchronized programs of gene regulation might be executed during drug addiction  <cit> ; however, the precise mechanism remains unclear.

previous research has shown that addictive drugs induce aberrant expression of non-coding rnas   <cit> , the function of which are thought to be among the most important mechanisms underlying gene regulation  <cit> . for example, increasing evidence has demonstrated that micrornas play an important role in modulating the potency of addictive drugs by mediating the expressions of target genes  <cit> . however, the potential effects of lncrna on drug addiction remain largely unknown.

lncrnas are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nt that lack the ability to encode protein products  <cit> . as transcriptional modulators and epigenetic regulators, lncrnas have been found to regulate the expressions of proximal and distal protein-coding genes through cis- and trans-acting mechanisms  <cit> . emerging evidence has implicated lncrnas in neuroplasticity, brain development, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders  <cit> , together, this evidence suggests a meaningful role of lncrnas in brain diseases including drug addiction. using microarrays, recent studies have revealed that cocaine and heroin induce widespread alterations of lncrnas in the nac of cocaine-conditioned mice and heroin addicts  <cit> ,which suggests that lncrnas might play an important role in the regulation of drug addiction. however, all of these studies targeted small numbers of candidate lncrnas and therefore could not identify unknown lncrnas and did not provide a complete spectrum of drug-induced changes in lncrna levels.

to investigate the expression profiles of lncrnas and their potential effects on meth-induced locomotor sensitization in the current study, we examined the alterations in lncrnas expression profiles in the nac of meth-sensitized mice via the transcriptomics-based approach, ssrna-seq. we found that meth elicited global changes in lncrnas expression in the nac of mice and that predicted cis- and trans-associated genes were significantly enriched during neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and reward and addiction. our results suggest that lncrnas might be involved in the regulation of expression of associated genes and thus contribute to meth-induced locomotor sensitization and addiction.

RESULTS
ssrna-seq summary
complementary dna samples generated from rna that was extracted from the nac lysates of saline and meth-treated mice were measured with ssrna-seq. a total of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million clean reads were obtained from the saline and meth groups of mice, respectively. the clean reads of each group were then separately aligned to the mouse genome   <cit>  and  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  reads were mapped to the reference genome, which included  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  million  perfectly matched reads . additionally, among the total mapped reads, there were  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  million  uniquely matched reads that were obtained from the saline and meth groups of mice, respectively . all of the mapped reads were then assembled and annotated. consequently,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were obtained from the saline and meth groups of mice, respectively, by alignment to the database of non-coding rnas   <cit>  . the analysis of the relative expression levels  of these known lncrnas revealed that the vast majority of the lncrnas  were expressed at the level of rpkm <  <dig> . moreover, we also identified  <dig> and  <dig> novel lncrna candidates in the saline and meth groups, that could not matched to any sequences that correspond to known lncrnas or protein-coding transcripts.table  <dig>

meth- induced aberrant expressions of lncrnas in the nac of mice
to further identify the differentially expressed lncrnas in the nac of the meth-sensitized mice, the rpkm ratios of the lncrnas in each group were subjected to a log- <dig> transform to produce fold changes and threshold based on a combination of statistical significance  and the absolute value of the fold change  was set. we found that  <dig> known lncrnas exhibited significantly altered expressions in the nac of the meth-sensitized mice that included  <dig> up-regulations and  <dig> down-regulations . a volcano plot illustrated the variance in the lncrnas numbers at different p-values and fold changes .figure  <dig>

validation of lncrnas expression by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate the meth-induced changes in lncrna expression that were detected by ssrna-seq,  <dig> differentially expressed lncrnas were randomly selected, and their expressions were then examined with quantitative real-time pcr . as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> of the selected lncrnas were significantly changed  in meth-sensitized mice as detected by both ssrna-seq  and qpcr . although the expression of ak <dig> and ak <dig> detected by qpcr were not significantly regulated, they showed similar expression trends in qpcr and ssrna-seq. moreover, a strong agreement across the two methods was observed in that the results of the qpcr were similar to those obtained from the ssrna-seq analyses . these data indicated the good reproducibility of the observed expression changes in the lncrnas based on an independent method.figure  <dig>

genomic characterization of differentially expressed known lncrnas
to predict the potential role of lncrnas in the regulation of the expressions of protein-coding genes, we next investigated the genomic context of the differentially expressed known lncrnas. lncrnas can be classified into intergenic lncrnas, sense-overlap lncrnas and antisense-overlap lncrnas based on their locations relative to protein-coding genes. here, we identified  <dig> sense-overlap ,  <dig> antisense-overlap  and  <dig> intergenic  lncrnas among the differentially expressed known lncrnas that we detected .figure  <dig>

lncrnas in cis regulation
lncrnas can regulate the expressions of genes that are located on that same chromosome, and such regulation is called cis regulation  <cit> . based on their genomic localization relative to nearby protein-coding genes, lncrnas can be further classified as sense intronic, overlapping, nat, lincrna and bidirectional, and these classes of lncrnas have been reported to regulate their protein-coding host genes in cis manners  <cit> . in the present study, we subjected the differentially expressed known lncrnas to cis analysis, and we found that 82%  of the differentially expressed known lncrnas could act in a cis manner, including  <dig> sense intronic lncrnas,  <dig> overlapping lncrnas,  <dig> nats,  <dig> lincrnas and  <dig> bidirectional lncrnas .figure  <dig>

sense intronic lncrnas
sense intronic lncrnas originate from long introns that are transcribed from the same strand as the associated protein-coding genes. the sense intronic lncrnas are biologically significant because they have been found to be both co-expressed with their host protein-coding gene and independently expressed, particularly in the mouse brain  <cit> . in the present study, we identified  <dig> known lncrnas that were located in the introns of protein-coding genes that include  <dig> down-regulated and one up-regulated lncrnas .

overlapping lncrnas
overlapping lncrnas are lncrnas contain a protein-coding gene and are transcribed in the same direction as that gene. this type of lncrna can regulate downstream transcription by opening the chromatin structure, depositing histone marks  <cit> , and cis-acting promoter competition  <cit> . here, we identified  <dig> significantly changed lncrnas that overlapped with protein-coding genes, including  <dig> decreased and one increased lncrnas .

nats
nats are lncrnas that are transcribed from the antisense strand of a gene locus, and are overlapping with the rna that transcribed from the sense strand. lncrnas of this type have been discovered to be widespread in the mammalian genome and work through multiple mechanisms to regulate the expressions of their sense partners  <cit> . in the present study, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed nats that included  <dig> that were down-regulated and eight that were up-regulated . for example, the potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily q, member  <dig>  opposite strand/antisense transcript  <dig>  , and the zinc finger homeobox  <dig>  antisense   were found to be significantly down-expressed in the meth-treated mice and have previously been found to modulate the expression of their sense partners  <cit> .

lincrnas
lincrnas are found more than 10 kb away from any nearby protein-coding locus  <cit> . a possible working model of the role of lincrnas in gene regulation involves their actions as enhancers that activate transcriptional promotion and chromatin looping  <cit> . we identified  <dig> lincrnas that were significantly altered in the meth-sensitized mice, including  <dig> that were down-regulated and five that were up-regulated . several lincrnas, including nuclear-enriched abundant transcript  <dig>  , nuclear enriched abundant transcript  <dig>  , and myocardial infarction associated transcript  , that were significantly down-regulated by meth have previously been characterized as possessing neurological functions  <cit> .

bidirectional lncrnas
bidirectional lncrnas are oriented head-to-head with a protein-coding gene within 1 kb, but are transcribed in the opposite direction. bidirectional lncrnas have been shown to affect the cis regulation of the nearby protein-coding genes potentially via promoter competition or the maintenance of an open chromatin structure  <cit> . we identified  <dig> aberrantly altered lncrnas that formed bidirectional pairs with protein-coding genes in the current study  that included  <dig> down-regulated and two up-regulated lncrnas.

lncrnas in trans regulation
lncrnas can work in a trans manner when they affect genes on other chromosomes  <cit> . previous studies have shown that lncrnas can interact with associated mrnas via the formation of complementary hybrids  <cit> . therefore, using the rnaplex program  <cit> , we subjected the differentially expressed known lncrnas to trans-analysis and found that 64%  of the differentially expressed known lncrnas were capable of acting in a trans manner, and  <dig> of the associated genes have been found. we further investigated the networks formed by the trans-acting lncrnas and their associated genes, which are termed the ‘many-to-many’ type; i.e., one lncrna can have one or more associated genes. as shown in figure 4b,  <dig> down-regulated lncrnas exhibited one-to-one trans-regulation relationships with protein-coding genes . in contrast, over 90% lncrnas  might have more than one trans-associated gene. additionally, the cis- and trans-acting lncrnas also overlapped, and  <dig> known lncrnas were identified as having both cis- and trans-associated genes .

functional analyses of the cis- and trans-associated genes
to further investigate the potential effects of known lncrnas on meth-induced locomotor sensitization, we subjected the cis- and trans-associated genes to go and kegg pathway analyses. using p <  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>  as cutoff for significance, we found that the predicted cis and trans-associated genes were significantly enriched in axon guidance, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, neuron projection, the mapk signalling pathway, long-term potentiation , long-term depression , calcium signalling pathway, dopaminergic synapse, and glutamatergic synapse; these processes are generally linked to neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and reward and addiction .figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have found that the expressions of lncrnas are aberrantly altered in the nac of cocaine-conditioned mice and heroin addicts, which suggests an important role of lncrnas in drug addiction  <cit> . nevertheless, the expression profiles of lncrnas and their potential effects on meth-induced locomotor sensitization are largely unknown. here, we used high-throughput ssrna-seq technology to examine the alteration in the lncrnas expression profile in the nac of meth-sensitized mice. using a stringent threshold for statistical significance , we identified numerous  meth-regulated lncrnas , and  <dig> of these lncrnas were also significantly altered in the nac of cocaine-conditioned mice  <cit> . interestingly, the differentially expressed lncrnas were less likely to be up-regulated and more likely to be down-regulated in the meth-sensitized mice. these data are consistent with the pattern of lncrna expression in the nac of cocaine-treated mice  <cit> . although the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear, these results suggest that meth might reduce the expressions of lncrnas. further studies are needed to investigate the potential role of these differentially expressed lncrnas. nevertheless, our findings suggest that lncrnas might be involved in meth addiction and provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of meth abuse. to our knowledge, this is the first description of global lncrnas expression profiling in the context of meth-induced behavioural sensitization. moreover, our results provide numerous of meth-responsive lncrna candidates for further functional research.

it has been shown that lncrnas originate from complex loci that contain interlaced networks of long non-coding and protein-coding transcripts  <cit> . analysis of the genomic characterization of lncrnas is helpful in predicting their regulatory effects at the biological level. indeed, a number of previously characterized lncrnas have been proven to regulate the expressions of protein-coding genes that share genomic loci with the lncrnas  <cit> . in the present study, we found that lncrnas were associated with protein-coding genes in a variety of manners that included sense intronic, overlapping, lincrna, nat and bidirectional. from the perspective of the lncrnas in their genomic context, our findings suggest the potential functions of these lncrnas in terms of meth sensitization. furthermore, lncrnas have been reported to be involved in regulation of gene expression through trans-acting pathways in which they affect genes on other chromosomes. here, we showed that numerous of meth-regulated lncrnas interacted with associated protein-coding genes in trans manners, which suggests that these lncrnas might be biologically meaningful. notably, the trans-acting lncrnas were found to form a “many-to-many” network with their associated genes, which reflects the complexity of the mechanisms of the regulation of meth-regulated lncrnas. interestingly, five lncrnas  that were found to be regulated by meth in our study have been reported to interact in cis or trans manners with targeted loci. for example, the antisense transcripts kcnq1ot <dig> and zfhx2as were found to regulate the expressions of their sense partners  <cit> , which have been reported to be involved in the modulation of ltp in the hippocampus  <cit>  and behavioural abnormalities  <cit> , respectively. it has been reported that neat <dig>  neat <dig> and miat function as cofactors for pre-mrna splicing by interacting with the splicing factors  <cit> , and significantly, neat <dig> appears to regulate neuronal plasticity by modulating the expressions of multiple synaptic genes  <cit> , which suggests that lncrnas-related nuclear modification might play a role in meth addiction through rapid post-transcriptional changes in gene expression. notably, a preliminary examination of a published dataset based on heroin abusers revealed up-regulations of neat <dig>  neat <dig> and miat  <cit> , which is suggestive of differential responses across different drugs of abuse. although the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear, these well-characterized lncrnas might play roles in terms of meth abuse. taken together, the identification of cis and trans-acting lncrnas suggests the potential functional implications of meth-regulated lncrnas that might control the expressions of proximal or distal associated genes and thus contribute to meth-induced locomotor sensitization and addiction.

a major function of lncrnas appears to be the control of the gene expression via cis- and trans-acting pathways  <cit> . thus, functional analyses of cis- and trans-associated genes are helpful for predicting the potential effects of lncrnas on meth-induced locomotor sensitization. in the present study, we found that the predicted cis- and trans-associated genes were significantly enriched during neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory, and reward and addiction . previous studies have demonstrated that the neuronal plasticity that occurrs as a consequence of exposure to drugs of abuse plays a critical role in the modulation of persistent addictive behaviours  <cit> . similarly, it has been reported that chronic exposure to drugs of abuse modulates learning and memory, which are thought to underlie rewarding and addictive behaviours  <cit> . therefore, our findings suggest that the lncrnas that were modified by meth in this study might influence the expressions of genes that are involved in neuronal plasticity, learning and memory and thus contribute to meth addiction.

moreover, we unexpectedly found that sense intronic lncrnas comprised the largest portion of the cis-lncrnas. previous studies have demonstrated that intronic lncrnas can either be transcriptional segments of processed mrnas or independent transcripts that are simply located within intron-annotated genomic regions, and intronic lncrnas that originated from pre-mrnas are thought to be the main actors in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . however, current evidence indicates that intronic lncrnas that exhibit independent transcription might also be biologically significant  <cit> . although the ssrna-seq technique used in this study cannot determine whether these intronic lncrnas are alternative splicing products of a pre-mrna or independent transcripts, meth-regulated sense intronic lncrnas were found to originate from the intronic regions of the corresponding protein-coding genes, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase iv , camp response element-binding protein  <dig>  creb-binding protein , glutamate receptor, ionotropic, ampa <dig>   and mitogen-activated protein kinase  <dig>  which have been suggested to be responsible for synaptic transmission and specific signal transduction in long-term drug-induced neuroadaptation. further experiments are needed to investigate the precise natures of these sense intronic lncrnas. these results suggest that the sense intronic lncrnas might play an important role in the regulation of meth-induced locomotor sensitization.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we reported a transcriptional profiling of lncrnas in the nacs of meth-sensitized and control mice. we have identified a number of meth-responsive lncrnas. the predicted cis- and trans-associated genes of these meth-regulated lncrnas were significantly enriched during the cellular and molecular events that contribute to reward and addiction. although further experiments are needed to investigate the distinct function and the precise regulatory mechanism of each candidate lncrna, our data suggest that exposure to meth elicits a global alterations in lncrna expression in the nac of sensitized mice that might be involved in meth-induced locomotor sensitization and addiction.
