BACKGROUND
the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase  is the third enzyme of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. this pathway has two major functions: the production of ribulose 5-phosphate which is required for the nucleotide synthesis, and the generation of nadph which provides the major reducing power essential for protecting the cell against oxidative stress and a variety of reductive biosynthetic reactions, particularly lipid production. both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase require nadph as the electron donor to reduce oxidized thioredoxin or glutathione  <cit> . since thioredoxin and gsh are important antioxidants <cit> , it is not surprising that 6pgdh plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. recently there is renewed interest in this pathway since it has been shown to play a central role in tumor proliferation process <cit> . the 6pgdh catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of 6-phosphogluconate  to ribulose 5-phosphate  and co <dig> with the concomitant reduction of nadp+ to nadph <cit> . this reaction is similar to those catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase  and malic enzyme because all three yield a ketone, co <dig>  and nadh as products. however, unlike the other enzymes, 6pgdh is metal-ion independent <cit> .

the enzyme 6pgdh has been reported to be involved in several human diseases, including cancer <cit>  and alzheimer's disease <cit> , through various studies over the last three decades  <cit> . one of the correlations between 6pgdh and these diseases is oxidative stress. as we all know cancer is a genetic disease. oxidative stress induces dna damage including modified base products and strand breaks that may lead to further mutation and chromosomal aberration of cancer. although it remains an open question as to whether oxidative stress is a causative factor or a consequence of ad, the correlation between oxidative stress and ad is well established <cit> . many evidence suggested that increased oxidative damage is an early event in ad <cit> . as a compensatory response to elevated brain oxidative stress, the activities of 6pgdh were increased in ad <cit> .

prokaryotic and eukaryotic 6pgdhs are generally homodimers, with a monomer of ~ <dig> amino acids and a molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda <cit> . each subunit is comprised of an n-terminal rossmann fold coenzyme-binding domain, a large all-helical domain and a small c-terminal tail. the active dimer assembles with the c-terminal tail of two subunits threading through each other. the coenzyme binding domain of 6pgdh has an α-β-α fold, while the substrate 6pg was located in the cleft between the α helices of one subunit and the c-terminal tail of the other subunit of the dimer. as expected from their essential biological functions, the amino acid sequences of 6pgdhs from various organisms show significant conservation. the complete 6pgdh sequences from five different species, including saccharomyces cerevisiae, sheep, escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and trypanosoma brucei, were aligned using the programs multalin <cit>  and espript <cit>  to show the conservation among species .

the kinetic mechanism of the enzymes from sheep liver <cit>  and from candida utilis <cit>  has been studied in detail. a considerable number of factors are capable of modifying the catalytic activity of 6pgdh. from the sheep liver 6pgdh, the oxidative decarboxylation reaction was reported as asymmetric in terms of ordered product release: carbon dioxide first and nadph last, while the favored binding order for nadp+ and 6pg is dependent on the buffer system used. in phosphate buffer, it seems that nadp+ binds to the enzyme before 6pg <cit> , but in triethanolamine  buffer at ph  <dig>  it seems that an initial complex composed of the enzyme and 6pg is dominant. in either buffer product release is in the same order with carbon dioxide leaving first, followed by ru5p. multiple isotope effects have been used to interpret the sequential mechanism <cit> . however, a recent investigation under a wider range of conditions suggests an acid-base mechanism <cit> . the general base accepts a proton from the 3-hydroxyl group of 6pg concomitant with hydride transfer and then shuttles the proton between itself and the sugar oxygen throughout the reaction, ultimately accepting it as ribulose is formed. the general acid presumably plays a role in only the last of the three steps, namely, the tautomerization of the enediol of ribulose 5-phosphate to the keto product <cit> .

due to the potential importance of 6pgdh in human diseases and medicine , it is crucial to better understand its molecular function through the 3d structural studies of this enzyme from multiple species <cit> . so far 6pgdh crystal structures have been solved in the three species . since yeasts are comparatively similar in structure to human cells, both being eukaryotic, in contrast to the bacteria and archaea, we examined the structural and biochemical characteristics of 6pgdh in s. cerevisiae, which is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model organisms.

in s. cerevisiae, the open reading frame yhr183w/gnd <dig> encodes the major isoform of the two 6pgdhs, named gnd <dig>  accounting for approximately 80% of the total 6pgdh activity, whereas gnd <dig> encodes the minor isoform <cit> . gnd <dig> displays very high similarity to gnd <dig> . in this study we overexpressed, purified and characterized gnd <dig> in e. coli. moreover, we determined the crystal structure of gnd <dig> in complex with two citrate molecules by molecular replacement and refined it to  <dig>  Å resolution. based on the comparative structural analyses in combination with the enzymatic kinetics studies, we obtained more insights into the molecular mechanism of this enzyme, especially the structure-based function of the c-terminal domain.

d root-mean-square deviation of bond lengths or bond angles from ideal geometry.

e percentage of residues in most favoured/additionally allowed/generously allowed/disallowed regions of ramachandran plot, according to procheck.

all the calculations of rotation function and translation function were conducted using the program molrep <cit>  in ccp <dig> . refinement was carried out using the programs o and crystallography and nmr system  <cit> . through the refinement we identified two unexpected electron clouds in the catalytic pocket as citrate molecules used in crystallization. it appeared that two citrate molecules were bound to the enzyme in each monomer .

similar to the 6pgdhs reported in other species, gnd <dig> forms dimer. each subunit has three domains . domain a includes a typical dinucleotide binding motif-"rossmann fold"  and two additional α/β units  which form the n-terminal α/β "co-enzyme binding" domain. this domain exhibits high similarity to other nadp+ binding domains such as the 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase  from thermus thermophilus hb <dig> <cit> , with a root-mean-square deviation  of  <dig>  Å. this data substantiates previous phylogenetic evidence that 6pgdh and hibadh may share a common evolutionary origin and enzymatic mechanism <cit> . domain b consists of residues 176– <dig> and is almost exclusively helical in structure. domain c  contains one helix  and one loop . the two all-α domains contain most of the residues involved in substrate binding and dimerization. the dimer is formed by the c-terminal tail of two subunits threading through each other forming a mobile lid on the substrate binding pocket.

the penetration of the third domain through the other monomer in the biological unit indicates a concerted folding pathway of the monomers during the translational or post-translational process. although the mean average temperature factor of gnd <dig> is as high as  <dig> , we still found a difference of temperature factor among the three domains, which are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. this is consistent with previous observations from the structures of 6pgdh from sheep liver and protozoan parasite, which showed the first domain's higher mobility in the absence of dinucleotide co-enzyme <cit> . gnd <dig> and 6pgdh of sheep liver both have smaller dimer interface of around  <dig> Å <dig> compared to the 6pgdh of t. brucei, which is around  <dig> Å <dig>  this is likely due to fewer residues  involved in the monomer-monomer interactions of the yeast gnd <dig> and sheep 6pdgh <cit> .

through the analysis of the surface potential, it is obvious that dimerization is not completely due to the interaction between the c-termini of each monomer. in fact, the interactions between the hydrophobic groups of domain b of each monomer contribute the majority to the dimerization.

the binding of two citrate molecules
to our surprise, two citrate molecules were bound to the active site of each gnd <dig> monomer . in citrate flc <dig>  oγ <dig> replaced the water molecule  in the structure of 6pgdh-6pg complex , hydrogen bonded to oξ <dig> of glu <dig> and formed a salt bridge with nη <dig> of arg <dig>  ohβ was located within  <dig> Å from his <dig> and arg <dig> of chain b, thus its negative charge is balanced by these two residues. in citrate flc <dig>  oα <dig> interacted electrostatically with his <dig> in chain b, while oα <dig> did not form any hydrogen bonds, nor salt bridges, with other residues. the role of o <dig> in 6pg was substituted partly by oγ <dig>  interacting with asn102; and partly by oγ <dig>  interacting with asn <dig> and lys <dig>  oβ <dig> and oβ <dig> located at the same place of o1α and o <dig> in 6pg respectively. and the position of o <dig> in 6pg was replaced by ohβ, interacting with gly <dig> and gly <dig> 

by superimposing gnd <dig> to the sheep liver 6pgdh , we found that the two citrate molecules occupied the space of one molecule of 6pg . moreover, the interactions and residues involved are strikingly similar <cit>  . although citrate has as many carbon atoms as 6pg, it is highly branched which reduces its effective length to about half that of 6pg. the negative charges between two citrate molecules lead to electrostatic repulsion, so they occupy a larger space than 6pg . however, this electrostatic repulsion could be compensated for by hydrogen bonds around the active site of gnd <dig> 

human african trypanosomiasis  has re-emerged as a major health threat in sub-saharan africa which caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosoma brucei <cit> . 6pgdh emerges as a potential drug target in this disease <cit> . previous study has shown that citrate serves as an inhibitor of 6pgdh <cit> . structural studies of 6pgdh will definitely facilitate the development of 6pgdh inhibitors for potential therapeutic use. our current research provides for the first time the conformation of 6pgdh bound with an inhibitor.

the mutant proteins gnd1Δc <dig>  gnd1Δc <dig> and gnd1Δc53
the yeast gnd <dig> consists of  <dig> residues, with the residues after ser <dig> forming a small c-terminal domain. sequence comparison of the gnd <dig> with the corresponding enzymes derived from sheep, e. coli, l. lactis and t. brucei revealed the substrate-binding residues to be identical in all these species, but the sequences of the c-terminal tail are not well conserved, especially the region of residues 457– <dig> . from the structure of gnd <dig> we found two highly conserved residues, arg <dig> and his <dig>  to be vitally important for citrate binding. these two residues were also shown to be critical for 6pg binding from structural studies of sheep liver 6pgdh <cit> . the residue arg <dig> was reported to play an important role in anchoring substrate while 6pg is oxidatively decarboxylated to ribulose 5-phosphate <cit> . in an attempt to understand the potential function of the c-terminal tail on the dimerization and enzymatic activity we generated mutant gnd <dig> with c-terminal  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids deletions. these proteins, designated gnd1Δc <dig>  gnd1Δc <dig> and gnd1Δc <dig>  which contain residues 1– <dig>  1– <dig> and 1– <dig>  were overexpressed and purified, respectively. gnd1Δc <dig> contains both conserved residues , while gnd1Δc <dig> contains only arg <dig>  and gnd1Δc <dig> is a complete deletion of the entire c-terminal tail .

despite the fact that all of the truncated enzymes were soluble and could be purified by ni2+ chromatography and gel filtration using a superdex™  <dig> column, none of them had detectable enzymatic activity . it suggests that the intact c-terminal tail is vitally important for the enzymatic activity, even the region of residues 454– <dig> is not conserved among different species, nor directly interacting to the substrate 6pg or its homologs.

in addition, through purification and crystallization we found that gnd1Δc <dig> is less stable than the full length gnd <dig>  although the mutant proteins still dimerized. obviously the dimerization was not completely sustained by the c-terminal tail. this is the first data to suggest that the c-terminal tail of 6pgdh is dispensable for dimerization. in fact, the interactions of the hydrophobic groups of the domain b, which are mostly composed of helices, are the major driving force for the dimer formation. however, the c-terminal tail contributes a part to maintaining the stability of the protein.

km values for the gnd1
detailed kinetic analyses of the 6pgdhs from t. brucei <cit> , l. lactis <cit>  and sheep <cit>  have previously been performed. earlier studies showed 6pgdhs from different species exhibit very similar binding mechanism with the natural substrate, with only minor differences in the km for the substrate and the coenzyme <cit> . as we know, sequential reactions  are characterized by lines that intersect to the left of the 1/v axis in lineweaver-burk double-reciprocal plot, while in ping-pong reactions the lines parallel. to further validate the previous findings, we determined the km values of gnd <dig> at ph  <dig>  and the ionic strength of  <dig>  . the kinetic parameters were determined by varying the concentration of each substrate . it is obvious that in each plot there was an intercept to the left of the 1/v axis, as calculated from figure 4a and 4b. double-reciprocal plots of enzyme rate measurements as a function of substrate concentration indicate km values of  <dig> ±  <dig> μm for 6pg, and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm for nadp+ at ph  <dig> . the initial velocity pattern of gnd <dig> intersects to the left of the ordinate, suggesting a sequential kinetic mechanism which is in agreement with that of the enzymes from other species. kinetic analysis of this enzyme would also indicate the same mechanism of oxidative decarboxylation as in the sheep liver enzyme <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the 6pgdh is an important enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and has been linked to several human diseases. here we provide the x-ray structure of s. cerevisiae 6pgdh/gnd <dig>  the tertiary structure of gnd <dig> exhibits a high similarity to 6pgdh in other species, as well as conserved substrate and coenzyme binding residues. kinetic studies suggest a sequential mechanism for gnd <dig>  however, our structure reveals for the first time the binding mode of two inhibitory citrate molecules in the gnd <dig> substrate binding pocket, which provides clues for the development of specific inhibitors against 6pgdh. we further studied the role of the gnd <dig> c-terminal tail and found that it is dispensable for dimerization, but crucial for the enzymatic activity.
