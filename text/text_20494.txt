BACKGROUND
agricultural systems present spectacular and well studied examples of evolutionary changes  <cit> . indeed, crops and their wild relatives represent interesting systems from both agricultural and evolutionary points of view. wild relatives represent larger amounts of genetic variability than their domesticated descendants and the maintenance of this variability is of central importance in crop conservation and improvement programs  <cit> . wild relatives may also represent actual or potential weeds and they often constitute crop-weed complexes with the domesticated plants  <cit> . on the other hand, wild relatives are critical for understanding the process of domestication  <cit>  as they illustrate how evolutionary forces operate with or without strong artificial selection  <cit> .

cowpea, vigna unguiculata  walp., plays an important role in the livelihood of millions of poor people in the developping countries of the tropical region where it is used as food, animal feed or as a cash crop  <cit> . genetic variability of domesticated cowpea is low  <cit>  and most of the genetic variation of this species remains in the wild gene pool  <cit> .

as compared to wild cowpea, domesticated cowpea is characterized by large seeds and non-shattering pods. this crop was domesticated once from its wild progenitor var. spontanea somewhere in between senegal and eritrea although its precise origin is yet to be established  <cit> . this domestication took place well before  <dig> bc since clearly identifiable domesticated cowpea seeds were found in archaeological deposits dated around  <dig> bc, both in central ghana and in india  <cit> . domesticated cowpea experienced a double bottleneck: first from its wild progenitor leading to the primitive cultivar-groups , and then from the primitive cultivar-groups to the evolved cultivar-groups   <cit> . this partly explains the low diversity of cv.-gr. melanophthalmus  <cit> .

the wild progenitor of cowpea  pasquet, formerly known as subsp. dekindtiana sensu verdc.) interbreeds and produces fertile offspring through hybridization with domesticated cowpea   <cit> . this wild progenitor of cowpea is a weed, mostly encountered in cultivated fields and disturbed habitats. this crop-weed complex is distributed over a wide geographical range in africa  <cit> . however, while the existence of this crop-weed complex is obvious based on both morphological and molecular data, its origin and dynamics remain obscure.

low levels of gene flow were detected by all authors who have run source and sink trials with cowpea breeding lines: between  <dig> and  <dig> % on average but with some plots where outcrossing rates could reach  <dig> – 5%  <cit> . pollinator studies show that pollen may theoretically be dispersed over distances of several kilometers and exchanged between wild and domesticated plants  <cit> . nevertheless, the effect of pollen movement on population structure is unknown. both domesticated cowpea and its wild progenitor are characterized by a flower structure that should promote inbreeding  <cit> . accordingly, domesticated cowpea is known as an highly inbred crop  <cit> . therefore, gene flow between domesticated and wild cowpeas could be negligible.

last but not least, an insect-resistant genetically engineered  cowpea has been recently developed and may become available to african farmers in the forthcoming years  <cit> . the ge-cowpea expressing toxins of bacillus thuringiensis targets the pod borer , a migrant moth  causing almost yearly, often devastating outbreaks for the cowpea crops. this project is currently based on the use of a cry1ab gene, although a two genes pyramided construction is expected to be used in the future. the project is currently focusing on ghana, burkina faso, and nigeria. first confined field trials in nigeria appear very promising .

although autogamous mating systems should favour gene containment in the crop, the possible escape of transgenes encoding insecticidal proteins into wild relative populations might enhance the fitness of wild individuals. in a worst-case scenario, wild cowpea loosing major predators could become a more aggressive weed.

however, wild cowpea has never been studied at the population level and gene flow has never been studied within natural wild cowpea populations. such studies are necessary to draw a preliminary assessment of the potential fixation and spread of transgenes in natural populations  <cit> .

the present study was undertaken in order to investigate the mating system and the genetic structure of populations in the wild cowpea, in a region encompassing four countries of west africa, two of them targeted by the bt-cowpea project. we used allozymes as genetic markers to address the following research questions:  how inbred are the wild cowpea populations in this region? 2) is there evidence of gene-flow between populations, especially between domesticated and wild populations of the cowpea gene pool? both questions appear critical in the light of the forthcoming deployment of ge insect-resistant cowpea in west african countries.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig>  seeds originating from  <dig>  plants were analyzed. the genotype of the  <dig> wild plants was inferred:  <dig> plants from  <dig> populations in ghana,  <dig> from  <dig> populations in burkina faso,  <dig> plants from  <dig> populations in niger, and  <dig> plants from  <dig> populations in benin .

n, number of individual sampled; p, proportion of polymorphic loci; ho, observed heterozygosity; he, hardy-weinberg expected heterozygosity; fis, inbreeding coefficient over the  <dig> loci. significant test for departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium are indicated as ns for p >  <dig> ,  for p <  <dig> , * for p <  <dig> ; ** for p <  <dig>  and *** for p <  <dig> . m, monomorphic.

of the  <dig> loci screened, nine were polymorphic  with  <dig>  alleles per locus at the species level. the enp <dig> allele was encountered in a single plant from population bur <dig>  the amp <dig> and enp <dig> alleles were found only in burkina faso, while the pgm <dig> and pgm <dig> alleles were found in niger only. at the population level, 11% of loci were polymorphic and the number of alleles per locus  was  <dig>  . the effective number of allele ae per population, defined as the inverse of the homozygosity 1/, was  <dig>  . eight wild populations – from benin, ghana, and niger – were monomorphic .

mating system analysis
wright’s fis indicated clear deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium . in the domesticated populations, no heterozygote was found and the overall fis estimate was significantly greater than zero  in the wild populations. fifteen populations were large and polymorphic enough to analyze the mating system of wild cowpea using the mltr software  <cit> . the analysis of the mating system was carried out by comparing the inferred genotypes of mother plants to the genotypes of the progenies. high levels of self-fertilization were detected in all populations . the average outcrossing rate  based on multilocus-  and single-locus-  estimations were significantly lower than  <dig> .

tm is the multilocus population outcrossing rate, ts is the averaged single locus estimate of outcrossing rate, a positive and significant  reflects biparental inbreeding. f is the  single locus inbreeding coefficient of maternal parents, fe is the expected inbreeding coefficient at equilibrium,  quantifies deviation from inbreeding equilibrium based on selfing rate . tm and ts were tested to differ from  <dig>  the other parameters were tested to differ from zero. significance levels correspond to the results of non-parametric wilcoxon signed rank tests, ns for p >  <dig> ,  for p <  <dig> , * for p <  <dig> ; ** for p < <dig>  and *** for p <  <dig> .

outcrossing rates estimates and inbreeding coefficient were computed for  <dig> wild cowpea populations by comparing the inferred maternal genotypes to the progeny genotypes.

in the wild populations, estimates of outcrossing rates respectively based on a multilocus and an averaged single-locus estimator were tm =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and ts =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. outcrossing rate estimates tm ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . therefore, wild vigna unguiculata is a highly inbred plant with up to 97% of self-pollination occurrences . the amount of biparental inbreeding was assessed with the difference tm-ts. the average biparental inbreeding  differed significantly from zero  while it represented only 1% of the overall apparent inbreeding, indicating a low but significant occurence of mating between close relatives. in six populations  out of the  <dig> wild populations, the biparental inbreeding was higher than zero . significant heterogeneity in multilocus outcrossing rates  was observed among the fifteen populations analysed . this result does not include tm values with zero as standard error. we failed to find any correlations between the multilocus outcrossing rate and the population size .

inbreeding coefficient based on genotypic frequencies of maternal plants  was positive and significantly greater than zero . expected inbreeding coefficients at equilibrium, as estimated from the multilocus outcrossing rates , were greater than the observed maternal inbreeding coefficients , a trend that was statistically significant . the  values differed significantly  according to the type of habitat , with a positive median of  <dig>  in the disturbed habitats  and a negative median value  in less disturbed habitats . ben <dig>  ben <dig>  bur <dig>  bur <dig> are river and pond banks while nig <dig>  nig <dig>  nig <dig>  nig <dig> are partly or totally in “bas-fonds”, partly flooded during the rainy season. furthermore this difference among habitat types was not related to variations in the fe values  in these habitats, but was mainly associated with low f values  in disturbed habitats.

genetic differentiation and spatial genetic structure
amova  revealed substantial geographic differentiation in both wild and domesticated populations . in the wild populations, a strong and statistically significant genetic differentiation was found at the two hierarchical levels  indicating a clear geographic structure. genetic differentiation among populations was high in both wild  and domesticated populations .

df indicates the degree of freedom, ss sum of squares, ms mean sum of squares, σ² the estimated component of variance attributable to each factor and Φ the estimation of the genetic differentiation.. * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> .

analysis of molecular variance  in both, the wild and the domesticated populations. two hierarchical levels were analyzed in the wild populations: country level , population level  and only one level, the population level , was analyzed in domesticated populations.

a pattern of isolation by distance was revealed by the regular decay of the coefficient of spatial autocorrelation. significantly positive autocorrelation was found for the lowest distance classes , in the wild populations only . a mantel test did not reveal any significant effect of geographic distance in the domesticated populations .

relationship between wild and domesticated populations
as expected, domesticated cowpea diversity was very low, without a single heterozygous genotype observed . in the principal coordinates analysis  performed on the inferred genotypes of the wild and domesticated populations , the two first axes accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation. even if some wild populations originating from a same country, such as gha  <dig>  gha <dig>  gha <dig>  gha <dig>  were associated, no exclusive association based on the country of origin was observed. all domesticated populations were grouped at the negative part of axis  <dig>  however, four wild populations  were associated with this domesticated group. the last autocorrelation analysis  revealed positive and significant allelic correlations between pairs of wild and domesticated populations at a distance lower than 100 km.

discussion
the genetic structure of cowpea populations is highly determined by its mating system characterised by a high selfing rate. moreover, in line with a previous study  <cit> , our data are also strongly suggestive of genetic exchanges presumably caused by pollinator activity. the genetic variation in vigna unguiculata ssp unguiculata var. spontanea is low compared to those previously reported in cowpea using allozymes e.g.,  <cit> . however, these studies surveyed several subspecies and were therefore encompassing a much larger part of the cowpea gene pool. previous results related to var. spontanea   <cit>  showed higher diversity than the ones reported here, suggesting that west african var. spontanea represents just a subset of the diversity of the whole var. spontanea. indeed, the study of coulibaly et al.  <cit>  based on aflp markers  markers revealed var. spontanea to be more diverse in eastern than in western africa. population genetic study in a wild cowpea population in east africa  shows much higher outcrossing rates than in west africa . reasons explaining the low genetic diversity in the western populations could therefore include a predominantly selfing mating system and/or loss of genetic diversity occurring after genetic bottlenecks during the colonization of dryer savannas linked to the breeding system change  <cit> .

west african var. spontanea could be classified as primarily selfed plant, according to the criterion of schemske and lande  <cit> . in the present study, outcrossing rates t ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> % across fifteen populations, with a mean equal to  <dig> %. the high rates of apparent selfing in wild cowpea populations are consistent with the cowpea flower morphology  <cit> . in west african var. spontanea, anthers are in contact with the stigmatic surface within the flower bud. anthers release pollen during the first half of the night  <cit>  and the cuticle that protects the stigmatic surface is ruptured during the second half of the night, which means that pollen can start to germinate on the stigmatic surface a few hours before the opening of the flower .

although consistent with previous results, the outcrossing rates we estimated are markedly higher than previous studies based on pollen flow source and sink trials  <cit> . however, the source and sink trials that were used cannot necessarily detect the shortest pollen moves. our study focused on naturally occurring populations where individuals  can stand few cm apart while source and sink trials typically examine pollen flow between spatially clustered groups of plants usually separated by at least one meter.

a low but significant level of biparental inbreeding confirms the local activity of cowpea pollinators in west africa. such trends  are encountered in numerous wild relatives of inbred legume crops  <cit> . cowpea pollinators either belong to the genus xylocopa or the family megachilidae . they visit most of cowpea flowers at least once on average. however, these pollinators are expected to do many more flower-to-flower flights within a flower patch than between flower patches  <cit> . according to godt and hamrick  <cit> , the genetic effect of such pollinator behaviour is to reduce the single-locus outcrossing estimates, as observed here. the rather high level of pollinator activity is counteracted by bud self-fertilization . in turn, this mating system leads to almost complete deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium with a marked heterozygote deficiency  <cit> . moreover, the difference between the observed deficit of heterozygotes  and the theoretical equilibrium based on the estimated selfing rates tmfe = /], varied according to the ecological context of the populations. in rather undisturbed habitats the observed inbreeding tended to be higher than the inbreeding equilibrium while this trend was reversed in disturbed habitats . field and roadside are subjected to frequent disturbances and are characterized notably by ground transfers causing possible rearrangements in the soil seed bank. moreover, outcrossing rates may vary among years  <cit> . this could explain why the expected inbreeding equilibrium derived by selfing rate does not necessarily reflect the parental inbreeding.

because pollen flow is expected to be sharply reduced when distance increases  <cit> , local gene exchanges should mainly take place within populations, including between wild and domesticated plants when both are mixed or in close proximity. accordingly, strong genetic differentiation should take place among populations. the existence of spatial genetic structure and its scale of organization is a reflection of gene flow in space and time in relation to the spatial distribution and the colonization history of populations. a spatial genetic structure was found for proximate wild cowpea populations up to 100 km, which reflects a decreased probability to observe related individuals as the distances between populations increase. this suggests genetic exchanges among populations; however, our results do not directly shed light on the patterns of occurrence of gene flow in space and time. gene flow via pollen in cowpea is likely to occur up to few km with a very low probability of long distance pollen dispersal, and, in any cases, pollen movement is unlikely at distances over 10 km  <cit> . on the other hand, seed flow through ingestion by grazing mammals could involve much longer distances, though the percentage of seed survival through grazing mammal gut does not exceed a few per cent . wild cowpea is expected to express high levels of genetic differentiation and low levels of within-population genetic diversity. in this study, high genetic differentiation was observed at several spatial levels.

significant allelic correlations between wild and domesticated pairs located in a same zone  suggested possibilities of genetic exchanges between these two compartments. such correlations could arise from multiple local domestications of cowpea. however, considering that cowpea domestication took place more than 3500 years  ago, and that cv.-gr. melanophthalmus is the result of two bottlenecks which are likely to have occurred in different places in africa  <cit> , an alternative explanation for the allelic correlations must be proposed and is supported by results from pasquet  <cit> , coulibaly  <cit> , and feleke  <cit> , respectively based on allele amp <dig>  aflp alleles, and a chloroplastic dna. in these studies, alleles characterizing domesticated cowpea accessions, which are rather unfrequent in wild cowpea accessions, could have been useful to locate the center of origin of the crop. surprisingly, such alleles were found to be widespread across africa. the authors concluded that the presence of these alleles in wild cowpea accessions was the result of introgression of domesticated alleles into wild gene pool. our present results represent a more direct evidence of these introgressions into wild cowpea populations.

in an area largely dominated by the cultivation of cv. gr. melanophthalmus which is characterized by three recessive traits, i.e., white colored seeds, thin and wrinkled seed testa, as well as non-shattering pods  <cit> , gene flow between wild and domesticated cowpea is expected to be highly asymmetrical  <cit> . because the probability of wild dominant alleles entering the domesticated gene pool is almost null, the asymmetry is expected to be higher in cowpea than in other crops where the phenomenon has been observed  <cit> . if a farmer sows a seed from a domesticated flower that has been fertilized by wild pollen, the f <dig> plant will show shattering pods and smaller seeds with a thick and dark testa. farmers are not likely to select such small seeds with thick and dark testa for the next sowing, and therefore prevent the introduction of wild alleles into the domesticated genepool in areas where cv.-gr. melanophthalmus is cultivated exclusively. of course, pollen from such an f <dig> plant may fertilize a flower from a domesticated plant, but the probability of recovering the domesticated phenotypes  is very low in the end. this hypothesis is confirmed for domesticated cowpea by the near-absence of variability in its populations as well as the absence of some of the alleles encountered in wild cowpea .

because wild and domesticated plants still co-exist, it is likely that positive and negative factors affecting the survival of hybrids balance each other out. genetic swamping by domesticated genes would lead to the disappearance of wild types, which is obviously not the case. with the exception of one single wild plant, no large-seeded wild cowpea was collected. the exception produces partly white seeds and resulted probably from introgression with domesticated genes. however, this situation appeared to be an exception to a general rule. if gene flow from domesticated to wild cowpea does exist, the lack of strong genetic swamping and modified seed morphology in the wild populations suggests that these introgressions should be rare. alternatively, gene flow might be rather frequent while hybrids in non-cultivated environment are expected to be less fit. the white seed color makes seeds more visible to seed predators, the thinner seed coat makes seed less dormant, and reduced seed shattering could reduce dispersal distances.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed high selfing rates in the wild cowpea populations, nevertheless possibilities of genetic exchanges within and between west african cowpea populations do exist. numerous wild or weedy populations grow within cultivated fields or in field margins  <cit> , well within the distance over which cowpea pollen can be transported  <cit> . regarding the introduction of ge insect-resistant cowpea in west africa, the escape of the transgene into the wild gene pool will just be a matter of time, even if it is likely that the move will be slow.

there may be technologies to mitigate or prevent gene flow in the future but, in the mean time, the focus should be on determining whether there are any fitness gains provided by a transgene inserted into the genome of a cowpea wild relative  <cit> . if these fitness gains are negligible, there would not be any major problem associated with gene escape accompanying deployment of insect-resistant cowpea in west africa. conversely, a cowpea wild relative could become a more troublesome weed in fields and other disturbed areas, given a potential fitness gain provided by an insect resistance transgene. therefore, an assessment of the potential fitness benefits of transgenes is a prerequisite for the deployment of ge insect resistant cowpea in west africa.
