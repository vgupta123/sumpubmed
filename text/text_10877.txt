BACKGROUND
asbestos is a family of naturally occurring silicate minerals that was once used extensively in a variety of building materials and industries and is still found in older structures. exposure to certain forms of asbestos, such as crocidolite and amosite, have been shown to cause mesothelioma, asbestosis, fibrosis and carcinoma of the lungs, esophagus and stomach  <cit> . many developing countries continue to mine and use asbestos, presenting a continued risk to individuals.

the biodurability and chemical reactivity of crocidolite asbestos, taken together, create a formidable carcinogen for the human lung to handle. crocidolite can induce dna strand breaks and base alterations. one expected response to this damage is apoptosis/cell death. but under certain conditions, cell replication can occur before the dna damage is repaired, resulting in the formation of mutations. events which promote survival of the cell with dna damage and stimulate replication may lead to cancer. an unfortunate consequence of apoptosis is the stimulation of surrounding cells to replicate in an effort to repair the integrity of the damaged tissue. if the surrounding cells have experienced dna damage, the result could be mutations, which may lead to cancer. what sets crocidolite apart from most other carcinogens is the persistent nature of the inhaled fibers, allowing for continued damage to surviving cells throughout the lifetime of the individual. therefore, knowledge of the delicate balance between pathways that lead to proliferation or survival and those which lead to apoptosis or cell death are crucial for understanding the etiologies behind several asbestos-induced lung disorders and diseases.

much of the deleterious effects of asbestos can be attributed to the sustained synthesis of reactive oxygen species  which in turn results in dna damage  <cit>  and oxidative stress within the cell. iron associated with the fibers  can participate in fenton and haber-weiss chemistry and therefore plays an intimate role in ros generation . signals which reduce glutathione synthesis and increase efflux of reduced glutathione result in the reduction of intracellular glutathione concentrations  <cit> , thus, exacerbating the situation. at the crux of the decision to initiate apoptosis is a p53-dependent transcription response. although the events upstream of p <dig> activation and the importance of p <dig> targets are not well characterized, the result of p <dig> activation is mitochondrial dysfunction leading to apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis prevents continued proliferation of the damaged cell, but factors released from the damaged cell can also affect nearby cells causing inflammation and proliferation. in mapping the signal cascades which are activated/deactivated by asbestos, both human and non-human cell lines of epithelial and/or mesothelial cells, and rodent animal models have been useful. studies have identified mapkinase  <cit> , cytokines, akt  <cit> , pkc  <cit> , p <dig>  <cit>  and nf-κb  <cit>  signaling pathways as important players. chromosomal translocations, promoter silencing, point mutations, deletions, and/or familial genetic susceptibility are also likely to contribute to a cell's inability to respond appropriately to the genotoxic insult of crocidolite  <cit> . the number and complexity of the signaling components identified thus far mirrors the idea that the asbestos response is not only related to the presence of iron and the production of ros, but also involves receptor-mediated processes. an unavoidable caveat of trying to combine all the current experimental data lies in the inherent differences that exist between species and within cell lines, primary cells, and tumor specimens , and the involvement of neighboring tissue. the complexity of asbestos response and the multiple pathologies associated with the fiber would suggest the need for more systems biology approaches to the problem.

this study was conducted to begin to elucidate how the a <dig> human lung epithelial cell transcriptome is altered when cells are exposed to crocidolite asbestos at  <dig> μg/cm <dig>  an experimental strategy was developed to ensure a statistically robust, comprehensive data set from which global observations and analyses of specific pathways could be made. this study extends a previous microarray experiment  <cit>  performed at  <dig> μg/cm <dig> where replicates were not available. using the more than  <dig>  genes that were differentially regulated by crocidolite in a <dig> cells, we were able to: 1) statistically classify the data set based on gene ontologies. this analysis revealed significant representation by transcriptional corepressor and repressor activities. additionally, a significant unique representation by dna modification ontologies within a less significant dna repair/response ontology was found; 2) identify specific novel genes that may play a role in experimentally observed asbestos-induced responses; and 3) use a knowledge-based network approach to reveal a highly integrated series of networks related to cell death, cancer, cell cycle, cellular growth, proliferation, and gene expression. network analysis identified several functional modules in which previously unidentified genes may play a central role in the response of cells to asbestos, including participation from an extensive extracellular set of growth factors and cytokines. importantly, by combining genome-wide transcript changes and functional network analysis, we have documented a novel global view of the crocidolite-treated a <dig> transcriptome, which bears signatures of both proliferation/cell survival and apoptosis/cell death.

RESULTS
experimental design
given the difficulties in obtaining sufficient primary human lung epithelial cells to study the complex response to asbestos, many studies have instead employed the a <dig> human adenocarcinoma cell line. in doing so one must keep in mind that the transformed cell line may not be entirely applicable to normal human lung cells. however, all processes noted below are recapitulated in primary human lung epithelial cells, suggesting that a <dig> cells represent a valid model system. importantly, use of a human cell line avoids the inherent differences that are seen between individual patients. alveolar epithelial type ii cells are key participants in inflammation, fibrogenesis, and carcinogenesis  <cit>  and have been described as the targets of asbestos-associated lung carcinomas  <cit> .

the conditions used for obtaining the gene expression profile for crocidolite treated a <dig> cells were chosen to mimic conditions where a variety of biochemical observations have previously been made in our laboratories. exposure of a <dig> cells to  <dig> μg/cm <dig> crocidolite for  <dig> hours had previously been shown to result in the αvβ <dig> integrin receptor-mediated endocytosis of asbestos fibers  <cit> , mobilization of iron from the fibers within the cell  <cit> , upregulation of ferritin protein to combat the iron overload  <cit> , production of reactive oxygen intermediates  <cit> , efflux of reduced glutathione  <cit> , dna damage  <cit> , parp cleavage and activation of initiator caspases  <cit> . thus, at  <dig> μg/cm <dig> of crocidolite the microarray results could be related to an extensive body of biochemical information already available in a <dig> cells. in addition, this cell line has been used by other investigators for several studies to explore the mechanisms of dna damage  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit> , and invasiveness  <cit> . use of the a <dig> human lung epithelial cell line complements studies done in mesothelial cells  <cit>  and by the less carcinogenic chrysotile in bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> . our goal was to extend our results beyond lists of genes and ontological classifications to discover new pathways based on functional interactions. rather than diffusing statistical power by examining differences among multiple time points and asbestos concentrations, this experiment focused on the use of chemically defined crocidolite asbestos, a single concentration of crocidolite versus a control condition, and a single exposure time. this focus allowed for three replicates of mrna from control and crocidolite-treated cells to be analyzed using the affymetrix hgu <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip to provide the most comprehensive whole genome expression profile.

analysis of the microarray data
graphical checks of the gene expression data revealed a high-quality data set, with no spatial artifacts in the chip images, and a high degree of reproducibility within both the control and treated replicates . using tools described in the methods section and a false discovery rate  <cit>  of  <dig> ,  <dig>  genes with q-values  less than  <dig>  were called statistically significant. these results are represented in a volcano plot .

crocidolite induces large changes in the transcriptome of a <dig> human lung epithelial cells
among the  <dig>  probe sets on the genechip,  <dig> were significantly up-regulated , and  <dig> were significantly down-regulated  when a <dig> cells were exposed to  <dig> μg/cm <dig> crocidolite asbestos for  <dig> h. of the probe-sets that changed two-fold or greater,  <dig> correspond to known genes for the up-regulated probe sets, and  <dig> of the down-regulated probe sets correspond to known genes . genes that increased in expression five-fold or greater or decreased two-fold or greater and were associated with q-values less than  <dig>  are shown in table  <dig>  a complete table of all significant genes can be found as additional file  <dig>  the observation that most of the expression changes are upregulated is contradictory to a previous microarray study in a <dig> cells  <cit>  which used a smaller dose of crocidolite . a direct comparison of the two data sets was difficult due to differences in experimental design. namely, replicates at a single time point were used in the current study versus single chips over a time course, and a lower crocidolite concentration, which is a likely cause for some differences. cells exposed to asbestos may demonstrate a hierarchical oxidative stress response  <cit> . additionally, small amounts of asbestos have been shown to result in proliferation  <cit> . this may be attributed to a transient response to an increase in iron, which is limiting in cells in culture. however, comparison of individual expression changes in our data set to other known experimental results  demonstrated that our data set is consistent with the literature.

a <dig> human lung epithelial cells were exposed to crocidolite asbestos at  <dig> g/cm <dig> for  <dig> h. genes for which expression levels increased  <dig>  fold or greater, or decreased  <dig>  fold or greater, having q values less than  <dig>  are shown. probe sets associated with products of unknown function were not included. bold-faced genes were not observed in the statistically upregulated expression profile of hydrogen-peroxide-treated a <dig> cells  <cit> . a list of all genes for which expression levels changed  <dig>  fold or greater can be found as additional file  <dig> 

hierarchical clustering analysis  of our data set showed that the majority of the up-regulated probe sets clustered together in four different hierarchical clusters. the down-regulated probe sets were mainly in one hierarchical cluster, but had several individual genes spread throughout the dendrogram. within the four up-regulated clusters,  <dig> genes that were upregulated 5-fold could be mapped by functional string analysis shown in fig 2b. most of the gene products are connected; i.e., could be linked functionally by way of known molecular interactions. three major pathways  are represented in the cluster. this result is consistent with what is currently known about the effect of asbestos in epithelial and mesothelial cells. when the down-regulated genes were functionally clustered, only two  out of  <dig> had a connection .

validation of the microarray data
validation of the microarray data was confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr on four of the genes  and was further corroborated with previously noted results from experiments using human cells/cell lines . quantitative rt-pcr also demonstrated that increases in egr- <dig>  atf <dig>  c-jun, and junb message occurred after  <dig> hours and continued to increase through  <dig> hours . increased mrna expression from atf <dig>  c-jun, and junb was also observed by quantitative rt-pcr in primary human epithelial cells from small airways  treated with crocidolite . increased protein expression in a <dig> cells exposed to crocidolite was observed for atf <dig>  c-jun, and junb . finally, previous results using asbestos-treated a <dig> cells have demonstrated increased mrna and/or protein levels for il <dig>  tp <dig>  hmox <dig>  cdkn1a, sod <dig> and c-myc . the reproducibility of the microarray replicates, the significance level of the expression changes, and the validation by quantitative rt-pcr suggest that a highly useful and validated data set was obtained in this study. furthermore, the large number of significant genes allowed us to perform a comprehensive analysis of the crocidolite-induced transcriptome in human lung epithelial cells.

specific changes in the crocidolite-treated transcriptome
although it is clearly established that asbestos induces dna damage in both primary cells and cell culture lines, the literature illustrates that the molecular mechanism underlying this process and how the fate of the cell is dictated are multifaceted. although ros are intimately tied to the mechanism of asbestos-induced fibrosis and carcinogenesis, ros alone do not offer a complete understanding of the asbestos response. in order to identify genes for which expression level changes are specific for crocidolite compared to oxidative stress, we compared our data set to expression changes that occur in a <dig> cells when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. in a previous study that documented changes in the a <dig> cell transcriptome, cotgreave and co-workers  <cit>  showed that treatment of a <dig> cells with hydrogen peroxide results in dna damage and apoptosis. both hydrogen peroxide and crocidolite asbestos induced the upregulation of tnfrs10b, ppp1r15a, gadd <dig>  cdkn1a, btg <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  sdc <dig>  gdf <dig>  il <dig>  adm, fst, ier <dig>  fos, hmox <dig>  atf <dig>  and zfp <dig>  therefore, expression changes in these genes may represent a response to an oxidative stress. several unique genes that are differentially regulated in the crocidolite data set are noted in table  <dig> and include some genes which are associated with carcinogenesis such as stc <dig>  il <dig>  fn <dig>  bre, and ptgs <dig>  differences between the hydrogen peroxide-treated and crocidolite-treated transcriptomes may be due to the additional iron released from fibers, present in cells treated with crocidolite, or reactive nitrogen species, changes in glutathione content and/or the involvement of processes initiated at the cell surface by the fiber. it will be very interesting to investigate if these apparent crocidolite-specific gene regulations play a role in crocidolite-induced cytobiological endpoints.

ontological analysis of the crocidolite-treated lung transcriptome
in order to identify themes in the global expression pattern of crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells, we used gene ontology  classification. the differentially expressed genes  were analyzed using onto-express . the biological process tree was expanded to the fourth tier in the hierarchy as a balance between specificity and coverage. processes affected by crocidolite are shown in figure 3a. within the cellular metabolism classification, processes involved in transcription and phosphorus metabolism were highly represented. expansion of molecular functions to the third tier revealed a large number of genes with functions related to transcription ). this observation was expanded upon by performing a global test  <cit>  to identify specific gene ontologies related to transcription, where the expression levels of all the genes in the ontology give useful information for predicting the clinical outcome . ontologies of particular interest related to transcription factor activity  are summarized in figure 3c, with nodes colored to correspond to global test p-values; the lighter nodes have lower p-values. to reduce visual clutter, only the last four digits of each ontology's identifier are reported in figure 3c. the ontological analysis illustrates that transcriptional corepressor activity and repressor activity are highly represented in the data set. overall the transcriptome of crocidolite-treated human lung epithelial  cells is heavily populated by gene products associated with transcription.

we also noted that dna repair terms were not highly represented in the data set. although this result was initially surprising, we noted that the transcriptome of a <dig> cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide, which also induces dna damage, was also underrepresented in dna repair terms  <cit> . in order to gain a better understanding of how the transcriptome of crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells is reorganized in response to the resulting dna damage, the results of the global test discussed above were also applied to ontologies related to dna damage/repair. although this analysis  confirms the overall observation that many of the processes related to dna repair/damage are not highly represented, the analysis also highlights specific nodes in the go tree related to dna damage-induced phosphorylation , dna dealkylation , dna methylation , and dna alkylation . in light of the several studies directed at linking promoter methylation status and carcinogenesis , it is interesting to point out that in as little as  <dig> hours of crocidolite exposure, the a <dig> transcriptome may be poised to affect the dna methylation status that is associated with lung cancer pathogenesis.

identification of novel, putative crocidolite-related genes
even though this study was initiated to understand the broad changes that occur in the lung transcriptome upon crocidolite exposure, we also sought to identify novel genes that had no previous association with crocidolite and to identify genes that may be downstream targets of well-known crocidolite-related players. given the complex effects that asbestos has on the lung system, we expected that a systems biology approach may provide novel avenues to study. nr4a <dig>  nr4a <dig>  and nr4a <dig> belong to the steroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of immediate early genes that are induced by serum, growth factors and receptor engagement and are thus implicated in cell mitogenic responses. although previously characterized as pro-survival, studies have also suggested an important role for these receptors in cell transformation and tumorigenicity via their anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic functions  <cit> . thus, depending on cellular context, these gene products may serve as switches in determining cell fate. all three members of this family show increased expression in our data set  but have not previously been implicated in crocidolite-induced pulmonary toxicity.

modulation of apoptosis can also be affected by bre , a stress-modulating protein also known as tnfrsf1a modulator. bre expression was upregulated >7-fold in crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells. exogenous overexpression of bre can attenuate intrinsic apoptosis and promote growth of the transfected lewis lung carcinoma line in mice  <cit>  which is consistent with the recent finding that bre protein is overexpressed in human hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> . given the ability of bre to interact with both fas  <cit>  and the tnf receptor  <dig>  <cit> , and the observation that tnfα can attenuate asbestos cytotoxicity in mesothelial cells  <cit> , it will be very interesting to investigate possible roles of bre in crocidolite-treated human lung cells. also noteworthy is the upregulation of several "early response" nf-κb targets  <cit>  in our dataset  including tnfaip <dig>  il <dig>  il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ptgs <dig>  and plau. activation of the nf-κb pathway is thought to play a critical role in cell survival in asbestos-treated cells  <cit> , but only a few of the downstream targets of nf-κb have been identified.

the relationship between asbestos and calcium has received little attention in recent years, but the initial studies suggest that calcium may have an important role to play . perhaps most compelling is the ability of the calcium-chelator quin- <dig> to prevent crocidolite-induced dna breaks  <cit> . additionally, several players in the asbestos response are regulated by calcium levels, e.g., protein kinase c  <cit> . we were therefore interested in determining if the crocidolite-treated transcriptome demonstrated any clues regarding the regulation of calcium homeostasis. we observed that expression of mctp <dig> and stc <dig> were both upregulated in our data set by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively. mctp <dig> is a transmembrane protein that binds calcium ions via c <dig> domains. unique properties of this protein suggest that these proteins function in ca2+ signaling at the membrane  <cit> . stanniocalcin  <dig>  has long been studied as a regulator of both phosphate and calcium homeostasis in bony fish, but has recently received attention in mammalian systems. stc <dig> is a glycoprotein present in a variety of mammalian tissues where it can function as a regulator of gene expression and modulator of transendothelial cell migration  <cit> , and can also affect cellular metabolism by perturbing mitochondrial electron transport chain and mitochondrial calcium transport  <cit> . stc <dig> affects calcium homeostasis in the heart  <cit>  and the brain  <cit> . growing evidence also points to a correlation between stc <dig> expression and the development of human cancers  <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr also demonstrated a  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold increase in stc <dig> message in primary human saec exposed to crocidolite.

finally, in recent years a significant number of studies have been directed at understanding how the disruption of dynamic chromatin remodeling is linked to carcinogenesis. mechanisms including the previously mentioned dna methylation status and the use of histone modifications have led to the discovery of prognostic biomarkers  <cit>  and the use of hdac inhibitors as cancer therapeutics  <cit> . it is of little surprise then to find several differentially regulated genes in crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells that could participate in chromatin remodeling including the jumonji domain histone demethylases jmjd1c, jmjd <dig> and jmjd1a, all of which showed increased expression . other genes of interest are discussed below.

pathway analysis provides unique view of function-based networks in crocidolite-treated cells
in order to extract novel biological insight from the large number of genes upregulated/downregulated in our study, we employed a structured network knowledge-based approach to analyze genome-wide transcriptional responses in the context of known functional interrelationships among proteins, small molecules and phenotypes . networks are generated not only based on functional interactions but also statistical likelihood. genes/gene products are represented as nodes and are color-coded to represent fold-change in expression level. interactions between nodes are designated as edges, or lines, and represent physical, transcriptional, and enzymatic interactions.

statistically significant function-based networks and pathways
using expression changes that were differentially regulated by ± 2-fold and having p values less than or equal to  <dig> , ingenuity pathway® analysis demonstrated a highly complex set of  <dig> interconnected networks. these networks were related to cell death, cancer, cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, and gene expression. all networks had at least one gene in common and many had two genes in common, underscoring the interplay and complexity of the crocidolite response. the top scoring network  was composed of genes related to cell death, organism survival and cancer, and highlighted myc, pdgf bb, and epas1/hif <dig> as prominent nodes. in particular, epas <dig> was a node for four genes whose expression levels changed 6-fold or greater. epas <dig>  is one of the transcription factors which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix pas family. it shares sequence similarity to hif-1α and analogously to hif-1α, regulates transcription of vegf and is observed to be upregulated at both the message and protein levels in a <dig> cells as a result of hypoxia  <cit> . prognostic significance of increased levels of epas <dig> mrna and/or protein has been observed in liver  <cit>  and colon  <cit>  cancers. interestingly, epas <dig> -/- mice show impaired reactive oxygen species homeostasis  <cit> , which may be linked to the role of epas <dig> in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis  <cit> , creating a hypothetical link between epas <dig> function and response to crocidolite.

this first network  is linked to the nrf2-mediated oxidative stress pathway  via the maff node. cellular use of this canonical pathway has been linked to tumor cell survival by maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and protection against oxidative insult. heterozygous nrf <dig>  mice exposed to crocidolite fibers exhibit accelerated development of malignant mesotheliomas compared to wild-type littermates  <cit> . several of the known nrf <dig> targets did not show significant changes in expression levels in our data set . although not all of the downstream targets of nrf <dig> were differentially upregulated upon exposure to crocidolite at  <dig> μg/cm <dig>  message levels for many of the nrf <dig> targets were present in above average amounts on both the control and treated chips. furthermore, data suggests that this pathway may be activated in a hierarchical fashion  <cit> , dependent on exposure. selective activation of the nrf <dig> pathway may contribute to carcinogenicity of the crocidolite fibers, while dysfunctional constitutive activation of nrf <dig>  <cit>  has been observed in non-small-cell lung cancer.

the topscoring network illustrates the interplay between processes involved in both cell survival/proliferation and cell death/apoptosis when a <dig> cells are exposed to crocidolite. activation of the nrf <dig> cytoprotective pathway in the transcriptome of crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells is imperfect. the observed selective nrf <dig> target expression would define an environment that is rich in hydrogen peroxide and incapable of redox homeostasis.

a global view of the functional networks in a <dig> cells in response to crocidolite
another approach to gain insight about the functional significance of the global changes in crocidolite-induced gene expression is to merge the individual networks and then identify nodes that are used frequently. over  <dig> nodes were observed within the  <dig> networks, making presentation of the global cellular network difficult. instead, the top five networks were merged using all known interactions in the knowledge-based database and the nodes arranged according to subcellular location resulting in figure 5a. this representation comprises ~ <dig> genes and their interactions and illustrates a transcriptome encoding an array of extracellular growth factors and cytokines. even though a population of exposed cells undergoes apoptosis, some cells may survive and be stimulated to proliferate based on factors released from neighboring cells. several high impact nodes including myc, jun, akt, p <dig>  and pdgf bb, all of which are established players in the response to asbestos, are also present. other genes that formed prominent nodes in the prototypical cell or adjacent networks included ptgs <dig>  smarca <dig>  pten, and e2f <dig>  they are shown as separate networks for clarity in figures 5b, c and 5d. the ptgs <dig> product, cox- <dig>  pten and e2f <dig> have previously been implicated in carcinogenesis, but their roles in the epithelial cell response to asbestos have not been studied. brg <dig>  the protein product of smarca <dig>  is a swi/snf related chromatin remodeling factor which recognizes acetylated lysine groups through bromo domains and is involved in cell growth arrest and apoptosis. oxidative stress and tnf-α induce histone acetylation and nf-κb/ap- <dig> activation in alveolar epithelial cells  <cit>  suggesting a potential mechanism to alter gene transcription in lung inflammation using brg <dig>  inspection of the network surrounding the e2f <dig> node identified several genes whose expression was differentially regulated by asbestos that also demonstrated molecular interactions with tnf. given the relationship between tnf and nf-κb activation observed in mesothelial cells exposed to crocidolite  <cit> , and the recent identification of e2f <dig> as a transcriptional activator recruited by nf-κb  <cit> , investigation into the role that e2f <dig> plays in human lung epithelial cells exposed to crocidolite should be forthcoming.

this analysis has provided the first function-based global view of the crocidolite-treated a <dig> transcriptome. several new candidate crocidolite-related genes were identified in the context of experimentally observed findings. apparent from the global analysis is a transcriptome bearing signatures of both apoptosis/cell death and cell survival/proliferation.

using pathway analysis to probe the role of p53
pathway analysis also detected significance in p53-mediated processes. this result is consistent with the observation that both amosite and crocidolite induce p <dig> activation. specifically, kamp and co-workers who showed that p <dig> mediates amosite-induced apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction in a <dig> cells  <cit> . although the mechanism is not clear, ros generated by the mitochondria, p53-mediated transcription, and translocation of p53/bax appear to be necessary components for apoptosis to occur. the authors suggested that other pro-apoptotic pathways may also be activated and a more thorough study of p53-targeted transcription pathways was needed. figure  <dig> shows a scheme representing these findings overlaid with the expression changes from our data set and molecular interactions identified through network analysis. since it is unknown whether ros detection and p <dig> activation require new protein synthesis, we did not restrict this part of the analysis to differentially regulated genes. several genes whose expression depends on p <dig> could be identified that were associated with both apoptosis and proliferation or survival. these results may reflect the expected heterogeneity in the population of cells after exposure to crocidolite, as discussed previously. although crocidolite induces apoptosis in many of the cells, the bulk transcriptome shows evidence that transcripts are present which could tip the balance in favor of cell cycle arrest and/or cell survival or proliferation. message levels of the p53-induced molecular switch p21cip/waf <dig> and klf <dig> were upregulated in crocidolite-treated cells. together these two products can have an anti-apoptotic effect  <cit> .

the importance of p <dig> in mediating apoptosis in asbestos-treated a <dig> cells has been documented  <cit> . analysis of p <dig> targets upregulated in the crocidolite-treated a <dig> transcriptome identified several candidate genes that may function in the observed apoptosis. interestingly, we also identified several p <dig> targets associated with cell survival/proliferation. this suggests that p <dig> may be an important molecular turning point in the decision of crocidolite-treated cells to undergo apoptosis or to proliferate, even in the presence of damaged dna.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have provided a statistically robust and comprehensive global gene expression profile of a <dig> human lung epithelial cells exposed to crocidolite asbestos. our data reveal a much altered transcriptome in which a large number of genes show upregulated expression. crocidolite-treated a <dig> cells are rich in transcripts encoding extracellular growth factors and cytokines and intracellular regulators/mediators of transcription. a global view based on functional molecular interactions illustrated an intricate network of paths associated with both apoptosis and proliferation/cell survival. this network allowed for the identification of novel, putative crocidolite-related genes, leading to several new hypotheses regarding genes which are important in the response of human lung epithelial cells to crocidolite.

our analysis demonstrates the power of a functional network genomics approach to 1) identify and explore relationships between genes of known importance 2) identify novel candidate genes, and 3) observe the complex interplay between genes/gene products that function in seemingly different processes. this study represents the first function-based global approach toward understanding the response of human lung epithelial cells to the carcinogen crocidolite. we have provided graphical representations of the highly interconnected networks that will be instrumental in modeling the impact of new research findings. our global function-based approach introduces new insights and novel avenues which can now be investigated in more detail to understand the effects of crocidolite on the human lung.
