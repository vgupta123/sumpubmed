BACKGROUND
tuberculosis is a public health challenge. it is estimated that one third of the human population harbor m. tuberculosis, however approximately only 20% of these infected individuals go on to develop clinical tuberculosis  <cit> . the infection with m. tuberculosis usually results in pulmonary tuberculosis but it can also manifest in extra-pulmonary sites, such as tuberculous meningitis, endometritis, lymphadenitis, pleuritis, etc. <cit> . in india, around 15– <dig> percent cases of tuberculosis among immuno-competent adults have been reported to occur at extra-pulmonary sites, whereas among hiv co-infected patients the incidence increases to more than 50%  <cit> . the classical route of infection is by inhalation of infectious droplets , however, infection can occasionally occur via alternate routes such as skin abrasions and open wounds  <cit> . extra-pulmonary tuberculosis has been always recognized as a sequel to primary pulmonary infection  <cit> . how exactly it occurs and its facilitation remains an enigma. the present study has been designed to sequence and analyze extra-pulmonary isolates to identify genomic patterns and features of m. tuberculosis isolated from patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.

genomic variations in m. tuberculosis have been studied using a number of different methods, such as spoligotyping and variable-number tandem repeats   <cit> . these studies have shown variations among different clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis. none of these approaches gives a complete picture of variations at the whole genome level, as each of the methods have their limitations. for example, the spoligotyping pattern would be determined by the strain present in the sample under investigation, and it would be difficult to determine if the observed pattern is due to a dominant strain or a collective pattern of all the strains present in the sample therefore, it is not reliable to use spoligotyping to establish mixed infection. on the other hand, miru-vntr has been considered useful for detecting mixed infection since it’s based on allelic variation. however, it is possible to have different genotypes with the same vntr pattern, particularly in case of closely related isolates. efficacy of dna extraction used in these assays can be potentially hampered by the presence of clumps / aggregation of mycobacteria in clinical samples / cultures.

the genome of m. tuberculosis strain h37rv was sequenced 15 years ago using the standard approach pioneered by cole et al <cit> . the analysis of the assembled sequences suggested that the genome size is  <dig>  mb. encoding about  <dig> genes  <cit> . the genome analysis also showed that there are a number of repeat families, particularly ppe and pgrs family of genes. these repeat families of proteins may have a role in pathogenesis. subsequently, a number of different species and isolates of the m. tuberculosis complex have been sequenced. on comparative analysis with other mycobacterial species the mtb complex clustered separately showing a high degree of sequence identity among this group of mycobacterial species  <cit> . different isolates showed polymorphisms at the level of single nucleotides, number of repeats at a given loci, indels and synteny  <cit> . attempts have been made to map polymorphisms that are correlated with some of the phenotypes, such as drug resistance  <cit> . though some correlations have been found a clear cut casual relationship has not been established so far. with the introduction of next generation sequencing, genome sequences of several isolates have become available and now it is possible to identify genetic markers for specific phenotype. it has also become possible to identify evolving patterns in genomes. for example, “hotspot” and “coldspot” regions have been identified using statistical methods and sequence information from large number of isolates  <cit> . however, most of the genome data available are from m. tuberculosis isolates derived from pulmonary tuberculosis patients. therefore it is relevant that isolates from extra pulmonary isolates derived from tuberculosis patients should also be analyzed at the genome level.

RESULTS
sequencing of m. tuberculosis isolates from extra-pulmonary tuberculosis patients
the details of the patient derived samples and the m. tuberculosis clinical isolates used in the study are given in table  <dig> and the techniques used for obtaining these isolates have been described in “methods”. these five isolates were subjected to spoligotyping and the results were compared to the shared-types  and lineages/sub-lineages described in spoldb <dig> . spoligotyping pattern revealed that of the five isolates, f <dig> and ac <dig> could be assigned to the beijing clade and t <dig> family respectively. however, the remaining three isolates  did not match with any of the previously described lineage of m. tuberculosis based on spoligotyping, hence have been categorized as undefined, .

dna was extracted from the isolates as described before  <cit>  and subjected to nucleotide sequencing using ngs technology . gross statistics derived from sequence data are also shown in table  <dig>  in general the number of short reads was more than  <dig> million with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides for each isolate. we have used the complete genome sequence of m. tuberculosis h37rv strain  as the reference sequence. the short reads were aligned to the reference genome as described in “methods”. while genome coverage varied from 82% to about 92% for different isolates, unaligned reads were between  <dig> to 16% suggesting that the quality of dna preparations from these isolates of good quality.

sequence annotation and isolate comparison
m. tuberculosis h37rv genome has been reported to encode  <dig> protein encoding genes  <cit> . nearly 84% of these genes displayed more than 90% coverage based on our alignments in all strains except f <dig> . genes with less than 10% coverage and/or read depth below  <dig> were considered as “missing genes” . the total number of predicted missing genes in all the five isolates varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> . some of these genes  were missing in all the five isolates. since genomic deletion can result in genes missing in an isolate, further analysis was carried out to identify large deletions in the isolates using pindel  <cit> , which detects breakpoints for large deletion using paired-end data. among the missing genes,  <dig> were predicted by pindel as those due to genomic deletions. out of these  <dig> genomic deletions,  <dig> and  <dig> are from f <dig> and ln <dig> respectively . in general a missing gene in one isolate was found in another. lysr family activates divergent transcription of linked target genes or unlinked regulons with diverse functions  <cit>  and it is one such family that was missing in isolate ac <dig>  in yet another example of missing gene is the absence of malonyl coa-acyl carrier protein transacylase, in all isolates except isolate ac <dig>  this is an essential gene for the transfer of malonyl group from coenzyme-a to acyl carrier protein acpm, therefore it is required for biosynthesis of cell wall in m. tuberculosis <cit> . in case of f <dig> several trans-membrane protein coding genes, such as rv <dig> and rv <dig> were missing. although we have considered repeat regions by realigning short reads with multiple matches, a number of prophage proteins  were not mapped. prophage proteins are quite often present in and around repeat regions and show polymorphisms with respect to their positions among different isolates. for example, two types of prophage proteins are present in m. tuberculosis h37rv and cdc <dig>  but absent in mycobacterium bovis <cit> . a total of  <dig>  missing genes are from pe-pgrs gene family.

analysis of single nucleotide variations
snvs were classified as major or minor snvs . all major snvs were grouped either as  coding or  intergenic depending upon mapping location. to understand the effect of snvs on the function of respective protein products we further analyzed those that map to coding regions . a total of  <dig> snvs were identified that are common among all isolates in comparison to h37rv strain . ln <dig> showed highest number of unique snvs  suggesting that ln <dig> has diverged much more compared to other isolates. many snvs that map to coding regions are likely to cause major changes in the form of gene truncation  and gene elongation  in different isolates. some of the snvs that lead to gene truncation, such as at position  <dig> in rv <dig>  and  <dig> in rv <dig>  respectively were also observed in a few other isolates of m. tuberculosis <cit> . rv <dig> protein is a potential oxidoreductase, containing the molybdopterin binding motif. a non-synonymous mutation  at position  <dig> was observed in rv <dig>  of isolate ln <dig>  which displays maximum number of non-synonymous mutations that result in stop codons  among all five isolates. beside modification in the gene products, snvs are likely to affect the level of expression of genes depending upon the usage of altered codons  <cit> . relative synonymous codon usage  was calculated for all synonymous changes in each strain and the results showed 5– <dig> fold changes in codon usage for many altered codons as a consequence of snvs. some of the examples of genes containing these snvs are enoyl-coa hydratase , mce-family proteins  and oxidoreductase   <cit> . rscu values of original codons and those for isolate ac <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  details are given in additional file 3: table s <dig>  snvs in the inter-genic regions  were also studied  using the database of promoters from mycorrdb database as reference  <cit> . we were able to identify snv in the promoter of the gene rv2779c, a transcriptional regulator in all isolates except ac <dig>  though, most of the regulatory regions in mycorrdb database are computationally predicted motifs, some of these are also mentioned in literature  <cit> . kstr <dig> is one such regulatory motif, shown to be associated with cholesterol utilization in m.tuberculosis during infection  <cit> . one snv found in the kstr <dig> motif of  <dig> genes namely rv3560c gene of f <dig> isolate and in the rv3549c gene of ln <dig> isolate, respectively.

minor variations
we have applied stringent criteria for generation of alignment and also have incorporated paired end reads for identification of genuine snvs from noise. typical alignments containing major and minor variants are shown in figure  <dig> . it is unlikely that these minor variants  are due to sequencing error. when percent variation per nucleotide position was plotted across read-depth, a bimodal distribution was observed . the major component was centered above 95% and the minor one at around 85%. this suggested that the isolates are likely to be a mixture of different genotypes. our hypothesis was checked by creating simulated data where two strains  were mixed and analysis carried out using our snv detection system. variations were identified from simulated data and a comparison with extra-pulmonary isolates is shown in figure  <dig>  the blue  and the red lines  follow more or less the same path. different isolates showed mixing of two genotypes and the ratio of the two genotypes varied from  <dig> to 15%. mixed genotypes may be due to picking up of more than one colony for expansion and dna isolation or changes in subsets of cells in patients or during routine culture. mycobacteria characteristically form clumps, making it difficult to establish clonal populations. we have made all efforts to obtain single colonies. however it is still likely that mixed colonies were picked up for analysis, owing to the inherent ‘clumps’ of mycobacteria. on the other hand it is difficult to reconcile the extent of variations observed, with our current understanding on changes that take place during mycobacterial proliferation.

the likely reason for the origin of mixed genotype could also be due to the fact that patients can be potentially re-infected / super infected by different strains or rapid genomic changes take place in a subset of cells in patients. recent investigations have suggested that several pulmonary isolates of m. tuberculosis display clonal heterogeneity  <cit> . heterogeneous population does offer selective advantage for survival of the tubercle bacilli within the hostile microenvironment of the host. these alterations may facilitate in vivo dissemination / migration of the tubercle bacilli from the pulmonary infectious foci to other organs, as has been speculated to occur in the infected host  <cit> .

functional classification and enrichment study of genes having major snvs
synonymous and non-synonymous snvs that map in the coding regions of genes were functionally classified on the basis of cog   <cit> . functional annotation of uncharacterized proteins was performed according to doerks et al.  <cit> . maximum number of snvs among the isolates was found in genes that belong to cog category n  . m. tuberculosis genes in this category are mainly “ppe” genes. polymorphisms in these genes are mostly non-synonymous types. in pathogenic mycobacteria pe/ppe proteins are involved in direct interaction with host immune system  <cit> . yongjun li et al., have shown that in m. avium ppe genes are associated with growth in macrophages and virulence in mice  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that these genes undergo high rate of variations compared to housekeeping genes  <cit> . biological processes, such as dna synthesis, transcription and host-pathogen interaction, depend on coordinated functional expression of multiple genes. therefore gene enrichment analyses were used to identify functionally important genes from snv data  <cit> . for these studies, the databases for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery tool  was used  <cit> . the output from david revealed several gene clusters that are significantly enriched . go terms of these enriched clusters showed that these are essentially membrane bound / trans membrane / two-component system and nucleotide binding proteins. mutations in these genes would potentially alter biological processes, as these categories of genes are needed by the bacteria for interaction with the environment. genes that form part of the family of polyketide synthase were also found among the enriched gene sets. the details of enriched clusters including enrichment scores, p-values in different isolates are tabulated in the additional file 5: table s <dig>  additional file 6: table s <dig>  additional file 7: table s <dig>  additional file 8: table s <dig>  additional file 9: table s <dig> 

study of insertion sequence elements 
is elements have been extensively used as a marker for strain identification in m. tuberculosis due to high numerical and positional polymorphisms . is elements can influence gene expression depending upon the sites of insertion, for example, is <dig> increases the expression of neighboring genes which are involved in virulence  <cit> . in this study an attempt was made to identify is elements, particularly is <dig> from short read sequence data of the isolates and to derive a distribution across the genomes. the strategy used has been described in “methods”. the results are shown in the additional file 10: table s <dig> 

total number of is elements was found to be  <dig> including  <dig> copies of is <dig> in h37rv strain <cit> . our studies revealed that the numbers of copies of is <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig> in different isolates and their positions differed from that seen in m. tuberculosis h37rv.

to validate the predicted translocation or deletion of the is elements in the  <dig> extra-pulmonary isolates, pcr amplifications were carried out using primers targeting the regions flanking the predicted coordinates of the is element. hence the inclusion of the is element would result in the generation of an amplicon larger in size compared to the deletion of the is element in the pcr targeted site. in this regard various primer panels  were designed  to amplify coordinate specified regions of h37rv and the  <dig> extra-pulmonary isolates. the presence of is <dig> in the genome of all the isolates was confirmed by pcr . of the  <dig> pairs of primer panels used, each targeting a specific positional co-ordinate, pcr products obtained for panels a, b, d, and e completely matched with the predictions . for example, panels a and b confirm the presence of the is element at the predicted co-ordinate  <dig> for the clinical isolate ac <dig>  and at position  <dig> for the clinical isolate ac <dig> , respectively. similarly, primers described in panels d and e yielded the expected amplicon of size  <dig> and 264 bp respectively, as the is element was predicted to be absent in the  <dig> clinical isolates, . whereas, when the is element is present, as seen in the reference m. tuberculosis h37rv strain, the expected amplicon size was 1563 bp  and 1622 bp  respectively, . panels d and e validate some of the variations in the integration sites of is element in the  <dig> extra-pulmonary isolates with respect to m. tuberculosis h37rv. whereas panels a, b and c  confirm the insertion of is element at new locations, in  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates with respect to h37rv strain. further, it may be noted that the is element was incorporated into the rv <dig> gene  in the clinical isolate ac <dig>  similarly in the same clinical isolate, another copy of the is element was found in the rv <dig> gene  considered important for glycogen synthesis. it is also clear from the data that different isolates may have a different history of movement of these elements. for example, in the clinical isolate ac <dig>  the is element was observed in rv <dig> gene  not observed in other isolates. we could not validate our predictions in a few cases .

snv based phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic relationships among isolates were derived from snvs as described in “methods”. distance-based method  was used to derive distance estimate between the isolates and branch assignments were validated using bootstrap. the results  showed that isolates ac <dig> and ac <dig> were present in the same branch suggesting a common lineage. this is not surprising as both the isolates were obtained from cerebrospinal fluid. f <dig> and f <dig> were isolated using fnac from lymph nodes and these were placed close to csf branch and separated from ln <dig>  a lymph node derived isolate.

CONCLUSIONS
our major finding from analysis of ngs data of extra-pulmonary isolates of m. tuberculosis is detection of genomic heterogeneity in isolates. the computational approach used by us can identify mixed genotypes even when one of the genotypes is represented at a low level. we have further analyzed the functional significance of snvs identified by using different approaches, such as cog. ngs data was also utilized to identify is elements and its insertion into various sites, among the different isolates. some of these predictions were validated by experiments. phylogenetic relationship among isolates is consistent with the origin of the isolates.
