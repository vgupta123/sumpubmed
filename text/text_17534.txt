BACKGROUND
dna methylation controls diverse aspects of genome regulation and transcriptional activity. methylation of mammalian dna involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5’-carbon of the cytosine in a cytosine-guanine  dinucleotide. this system of methylation likely evolved from a genomic defense system responsible for preventing the spread of parasitic genetic elements. dna methylation has since evolved to play an active role in maintaining genetic structure and genome regulation  <cit> . methylation is involved in x-chromosome inactivation  <cit> , silencing of transposable elements  <cit> , tissue-specific gene expression  <cit> , and gene imprinting  <cit> . dna methylation is widespread throughout the genome, and the maintenance of methylation patterns is highly regulated and tissue-specific  <cit> . dna methyltransferases  are responsible for de novo and maintenance methylation of the genome  <cit> . the proper establishment and maintenance of methylation patterns is critical for early development and the absence of dna methylation results in embryonic lethality  <cit> .

dna methylation also regulates pseudogenes within the genome  <cit> . pseudogenes are decayed copies of active genes that have arisen from either a duplication event, in which the entire gene or portion of a gene is duplicated , or from the retrotransposition of an rna transcript into the genome . an analysis of the human genome estimates that as many as  <dig>  pseudogenes are evenly distributed throughout the genome, and approximately 70% of these are processed pseudogenes  <cit> . ten percent of genes within the human genome have at least one corresponding pseudogene  <cit> , and pseudogenes primarily arise from parental genes that are transcriptionally active within the germ line.

the same regulatory network that inhibits transposable element movement likely induces dna methylation on pseudogenes. methylation of pseudogenes is elevated in embryos, likely as a mechanism for preventing the spread of transposable elements during embryogenesis  <cit> . in plants, the inactivation of methyltransferases resulted in the widespread activation of transposable elements and pseudogenes  <cit> , demonstrating that dna methylation is sufficient to prevent the activation of pseudogenes. in humans, pseudogenes are highly methylated, presumably to prevent transcription and further transposition  <cit> .

characterizing methylation patterns of pseudogenes is critical, as pseudogenes with high sequence identity to parental genes can lead to misinterpretation of results in methylation studies  <cit> . the characterization of pseudogene methylation signatures also reveals how dna segments are regulated by methylation networks once inserted into the genome. in order to better understand how methylation patterns are established and maintained on pseudogenes, we examined the methylation status of four pseudogenes derived from the translational enhancer lin <dig>  this gene is important in early embryo development and can also act as a reprogramming factor in the production of induced pluripotent stem cells  <cit> .

lin <dig> has given rise to at least ten processed pseudogenes within the bovine genome that vary in length between  <dig> to 4000 bp . the protein-coding region of lin <dig> contains a high concentration of cpg sites, making the gene a potential target for dna methylation once inserted elsewhere in the genome as a pseudogene. by measuring the methylation levels of selected pseudogenes and the lin <dig> gene, we sought to determine whether the same regulatory mechanism that directs and maintains methylation of the lin <dig> gene also controls the methylation status of lin <dig> pseudogenes. additionally we examined the expression of genes near the insertion site to determine whether pseudogene methylation is involved in transcriptional control of adjacent genes. this study is the first to characterize the methylation status of lin <dig> and its associated pseudogenes, and is the first such research to characterize the methylation status of a pseudogene family within the bovine genome.

RESULTS
we assessed the methylation status of four lin <dig> processed pseudogenes in six bovine tissue samples, including brain, liver, testes, fibroblast cells, ivf blastocyst stage embryo, and oocyte. three of the lin <dig> pseudogenes contain the entire protein-coding sequence as well as a long region downstream from the stop codon. a fourth pseudogene contains only the terminal portion of the protein-coding region and downstream transcript . these pseudogenes are likely the products of retrotransposition of the lin <dig> transcript following rna splicing. these four pseudogenes were selected for examination based on their retention of the protein-coding region, as well as insertion location and number of cpg sites. the pseudogenes examined were as follows: lin28p-ch: <dig>  inserted into chromosome  <dig> approximately 20kbp upstream of the ubqln <dig> gene , lin28p-ch: <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> inserted into the fourth intron of the man2a <dig> gene , lin28p-ch: <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> inserted within the first intron of acadsb , and lin28p-ch <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> has no proximity to any gene  . primer sets were designed to profile each individual pseudogene for a sequence within the protein-coding region. we selected a region that offered the greatest degree of overlap between the lin <dig> gene and associated pseudogenes. however, due to the high sequence identity between the pseudogenes and the parental gene, the overlap of examined cpg sites was limited by our ability to specifically amplify each individual pseudogene. the available sites in the lin <dig> gene were restricted to just seven sites that were proximal to the overlapped regions within the pseudogenes. pseudogenes lin28p-ch: <dig>  lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> all contain considerable overlap between identical cpg sites. lin28p-ch: <dig> contains overlap of only two cpg sites with the lin <dig> gene. the lin <dig> gene also shares only three overlapping cpg sites with lin28p-ch: <dig>  because of the restricted overlap of cpg specific sites and limited number of lin <dig> cpg sites, our assessment regarding differences between individual cpg dinucleotides among the four pseudogenes was limited. rather we focused our analysis to consider patterns of methylation among the amplified regions from each pseudogene as a whole .figure  <dig> the nine processed pseudogenes of lin <dig> aligned to the lin <dig> processed transcript. the horizontal filled in lines represent each pseudogene with the location relative to the start of the lin <dig> protein-coding region indicated at the bottom and measured in base pairs. vertical lines represents start and stop codons. sequence identity of each pseudogene to the lin <dig> parental transcript is indicated on the right column and the chromosome of insertion is indicated on the left. the dashed box shows the pseudogenes examined for methylation analysis, and the red box indicates the location of cpg sites measured for this study.



methylation status of the lin <dig> family
our results indicate that lin <dig> and all examined pseudogenes were methylated in all bovine cell and tissue types examined. due to the sequence similarity between lin <dig> and its derived pseudogenes we were only able to obtain coverage of seven cpg dinucleotides within the lin <dig> gene. this region was selected because of primer-specific amplification adjacent to the region examined in the pseudogenes. these dinucleotides are located in the third exon of lin <dig>  all of the cpg sites were methylated in each tissue to varying degrees . in addition, all pseudogenes examined were methylated in all tissue samples. however, each pseudogene demonstrated a distinct methylation pattern that differed sharply from the lin <dig> gene, and that correlates with the pseudogene insertion location.

the pseudogenes lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> were inserted into a location isolated from any gene, and both of these pseudogenes share a similar overall pattern of methylation . we analyzed methylation at nine cpg dinucleotides within lin28p-ch: <dig> and eight cpg dinucleotides in lin28p-ch: <dig>  in both pseudogenes, oocytes had the lowest levels of overall methylation and blastocysts had the highest level of methylation. the methylation patterns of both pseudogenes apparently deviated from patterns observed in the lin <dig> gene. within the lin <dig> gene, oocytes had the highest frequency of methylation. alternatively, the methylation of the parental gene was lowest in blastocyst embryos. in lin28p-ch: <dig> we observed three overlapping cpg dinucleotides with the lin <dig> gene. although limited, within these three overlapping sites, the inverse pattern of methylation between the lin <dig> gene and pseudogenes lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> is maintained.

in contrast to the tissue-specific methylation patterns, pseudogenes lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> both are highly methylated . both lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> were inserted into gene introns. lin28p-ch: <dig> is inserted into the fourth intron of the gene man2a <dig>  a majority of the  <dig> cpg sites inspected within this pseudogene were methylated in all tissue samples . the lin28p-ch: <dig> pseudogene lies within the first intron of the gene acadsb and is  <dig> kbp from the gene ikzf <dig>  similar to lin28p-ch: <dig>  all  <dig> cpg sites examined for the lin28p-ch: <dig> pseudogene were highly methylated at a high frequency . the high levels of methylation observed in both of these pseudogenes is in sharp contrast to the moderate levels of methylation of the lin <dig> gene and pseudogenes not inserted into gene bodies, none of which are as highly methylated for all tissue samples.

these apparent differences in methylation correlate to the location of insertion of the pseudogene. lin <dig> pseudogenes inserted into gene bodies were highly methylated. alternatively, lin <dig> pseudogenes with an insertion location distant from a gene varied in the pattern of methylation in a tissue-specific manner, although these tissue-specific patterns were inverse with respect to the lin <dig> gene .

non-cpg methylation
we observed two cytosine nucleotides that were not contained within cpg dinucleotides that were methylated to some degree in all tissues examined. both cytosine nucleotides were located within lin28p-ch: <dig>  both non-cpg methylation sites were located within close proximity to cpg sites. one non-cpg methylated cytosine was located between cpg sites three and four  on lin28p-ch: <dig>  the percentage of sequences that were methylated at this location in the tissues examined were: 9% in testes, 13% in liver, 20% in brain, 46% in fibroblast, 46% in ivf blastocyst, and 4% in oocyte. both cpg sites flanking the specified cytosine are highly methylated in all samples . the second non-cpg methylated cytosine observed is upstream from cpg site  <dig> in lin28p-ch: <dig> . the percentage of methylated sequences at this cytosine were observed to be: 8% in testes, 10% in liver, 16% in brain, 38% in fibroblast, 40% in ivf blastocyst, and 100% in oocyte. methylation of cpg site  <dig> on lin28p-ch: <dig> is high in all tissue samples . additionally, the methylation status of either non-cpg cytosine nucleotides is independent of the other.

single cpg demethylation
lin28p-ch: <dig> contains a single cpg dinucleotide that is characterized by a low frequency of methylation in a tissue-specific manner. this cpg dinucleotide is under-methylated in a tissue-specific manner at cpg site  <dig> in ivf blastocyst and oocyte samples . both samples are also under-methylated relative to adjacent cpg sites with a 13% methylation frequency in ivf blastocyst and 5% frequency in oocytes, yet highly methylated for other tissue types.

expression of genes adjacent to lin <dig> pseudogenes
end-point rt-pcr was performed to determine gene expression of lin <dig> as well as genes closely adjacent to the four lin <dig> pseudogenes in order to establish whether methylation of pseudogenes correlated with differences in gene expression. expression of the genes dhdds, man2a <dig>  acadsb, and ikzf <dig> were measured in testes, liver, brain, fibroblast, ivf blastocyst, and oocyte samples . gene expression of all genes examined did not correspond to methylation patterns of adjacent pseudogenes . ikzf <dig> is proximal to lin28p-ch: <dig>  which does contain a tissue-specific methylation pattern of a single cpg site. interestingly, the expression pattern for ikzf <dig> mirrors the pattern of methylation for lin28p-ch: <dig> in that this gene is not expressed in oocytes or blastocyst embryos , but is highly expressed in other tissue types  .figure  <dig> end-point rt-pcr. expression of genes lin <dig>  acadsb, man2a <dig>  dhdds, ikzf <dig> and actb in the testes, liver, brain, fibroblast, ivf blastocyst embryos and oocytes.



discussion
the objective of our study was to determine whether the methylation of pseudogenes followed the same patterns as the functional parental gene by examining lin <dig> as a case study. an observation that the lin <dig> pseudogenes maintained an identical or highly similar methylation pattern as the lin <dig> gene would indicate that regulation of lin <dig> methylation is intrinsic to the gene sequence and that methylation of pseudogenes with high sequence identity is likely controlled by the same mechanism that maintain methylation of the lin <dig> gene. alternatively, an observation that pseudogene methylation patterns deviated from the parental gene would indicate that pseudogenes are subject to local regulation of methylation patterns. in this study, we observed that lin <dig> pseudogenes do not recapitulate the same methylation status as lin <dig>  but rather appear to acquire methylation patterns independent of the parental gene. furthermore, we observed that methylation levels of the examined pseudogenes correlate to the location of insertion. to our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the methylation signatures of the lin <dig> pseudogene family and to identify an effect of genome location on pseudogene methylation. previous studies have shown that methylation patterns of pseudogenes deviate from those of the parental gene, and our findings are consistent with these observations  <cit> .

our examination of an entire pseudogene family highlights the diversity of methylation patterns apparent for highly similar sequences. lin <dig> pseudogenes inserted into gene bodies were highly methylated in all tissues examined. in contrast, pseudogenes inserted into genomic regions that are not proximal to genes had reduced overall methylation and were differentially methylated in unique tissue types. the measurement of methylation patterns in six distinct tissue types showed that methylation of pseudogenes can be highly variable in different tissues  and suggested that methylation of cpg sites may be differentially regulated in these tissues. pseudogenes not associated with genes had less methylation in tissue samples that were highly methylated in the parental gene.

we measured methylation of seven cpg dinucleotides located within the third exon of the lin <dig> gene. methylation of cpg dinucleotides within the gene body is generally associated with transcriptionally active genes  <cit> . this pattern is in contrast to methylation of the 5’ upstream and promoter regions of genes, which are typically associated with transcriptional silencing. methylation of these seven cpg dinucleotides was dependent upon tissue type. notably, oocytes had the highest levels of methylation within the lin <dig> gene. oocytes generally maintain low levels of global methylation relative to somatic cells  <cit> . following fertilization, global methylation levels decline further and are then reestablished during embryonic and somatic cell development  <cit> . the methylation level observed in the lin <dig> gene is counter to this pattern. however, methylation levels measured in the lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> pseudogenes are consistent with changes in methylation levels on a global level. within both these pseudogenes, oocytes maintained low levels of methylation, whereas somatic cells maintained high levels of methylation. it is possible that the methylation patterns observed for lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> are maintained by the same mechanism that maintains global levels of methylation, while methylation of the lin <dig> gene is maintained by a separate mechanism.

we also observed that methylation of pseudogenes depends on the genomic context into which the pseudogene was inserted. both pseudogenes inserted into the intron of a gene, lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig>  were highly methylated in all tissues. the absence of variability among tissues is revealing, as insertion of a pseudogene into a gene body appears to induce high levels of methylation. on the other hand, both pseudogenes not associated with a gene, lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig>  vary in the pattern of methylation within different tissue samples, but tissue methylation levels were similar between the two pseudogenes. the similarity of methylation levels among all tissue types between similar pseudogenes indicates that pseudogenes share a common regulatory mechanism that establishes and maintains the methylation signature. when considering the location of the lin <dig> pseudogenes in context of chromosomal structure, we originally postulated that lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> exist in a region that is likely euchromatin, as both pseudogenes were inserted into gene bodies . furthermore, expression data obtained for man2a <dig> and ikzf <dig>  suggest that these regions are transcriptionally active, providing evidence that the region maintains euchromatin structure in the tissues examined. because lin28p-ch: <dig> and lin28p-ch: <dig> are isolated from any local gene, it is reasonable to expect that the local sequence environment for these genes is heterochromatin in structure. however, our expression analysis did not directly test this hypothesis, since these two pseudogenes do not lie within a gene body.

other researchers have shown that a limited number of pseudogenes have evolved to play a regulatory function within the genome  <cit> . it is possible that the introduction of a pseudogene within a the promoter of a gene may provide a cpg-rich sequence that can be utilized as a site for gene silencing via dna methylation, although this observation was not evident in our study. as indicated by the results of our analysis of lin <dig>  these pseudogenes may undergo tissue-specific methylation unique to the region of pseudogene insertion, which lead us to investigate the relationship between methylated pseudogenes and expression of adjacent genes. however, evidence from pcr analysis of genes associated with the four pseudogenes, including dhdds, man2a <dig>  acadsb, and ikzf <dig>  suggested that lin <dig> pseudogene methylation status was not correlated with decreased gene expression. this observation suggests that in the case of the lin <dig> pseudogene family, methylation status of the pseudogene does not play a major role in regulation of expression of the local genes. however, methylation of a single cpg dinucleotide in the lin <dig> pseudogene was correlated with gene expression changes for the gene ikzf <dig>  the lin28p-ch: <dig> pseudogene is located within the first intron of acadsb and  <dig> kbp upstream from ikzf <dig>  within the lin28p-ch: <dig> pseudogene, a single cpg dinucleotide at site  <dig> is hypomethylated in the oocyte and blastocyst samples, a sharp contrast to the hypermethylated status of all surrounding cpg dinucleotides as well as the same cpg site in the four remaining tissues. interestingly, ikzf <dig> was not expressed in either oocytes or blastocyst embryos. although the expression pattern of ikzf <dig> was correlated with the tissue-specific methylation patterns observed for the pseudogene, it is doubtful that this single cpg site is involved in the transcriptional regulation of ikzf <dig> 

within lin28p-ch: <dig>  we identified two cytosine nucleotides that are methylated outside of the cpg dinucleotide context. in both cases, the methylation has occurred on a cytosine immediately upstream from a cpg dinucleotide. non-cpg methylation has been observed to occur with higher frequency in non-dividing cells and gametes, although its function remains unknown  <cit> . interestingly, the same cytosine nucleotides are observed within the lin28p-ch: <dig> and are unmethylated in all samples. this observation further suggests that upon integration into the genome, methylation of the lin <dig> pseudogene family is location specific and the methylation occurs independent of their sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the four lin <dig> pseudogenes examined in this study maintained methylation patterns that deviate from those found in the parental gene as well as from one another according to the genomic location into which the pseudogene was inserted. to our knowledge, this is a unique phenomena identified in our study, and examination of more pseudogene families will be required to determine whether the same observation is consistent for other integrated pseudogenes. pseudogenes derived from lin <dig> have undergone mutations and no longer maintain an exact sequence identity to the lin <dig> gene. sequence identity ranges from 84% to 97% , and it is possible that the differences in methylation pattern are a result of changes in the pseudogene sequence. additionally, our conclusions are based on methylation of cpg sites within the pseudogenes only, as well as a limited number of cpg sites within the lin <dig> gene. analysis of cpg dinucleotides throughout the lin <dig> parent gene as well as cpg dinucleotides flanking the pseudogene point on insertion would further add to our findings. future work should focus on these cpg sites and would further help determine how dna methylation is targeted to specific genomic regions. although methylation status of the lin <dig> pseudogenes was not associated with changes gene expression of proximal genes, this observation does not rule out the possibility that cpg-rich pseudogenes could serve as sites for regulation of gene expression by methylation, a hypothesis that may also be addressed by survey of other pseudogene families. new knowledge on the regulation of pseudogenes via dna methylation could contribute to greater understanding of the maintenance of global and/or regional patterns of methylation. future work on this topic should focus on characterizing methylation patterns for other pseudogene families to determine whether all pseudogenes are maintained in a similar manner or whether sequence specific patterns can be identified through analysis of pseudogenes.
