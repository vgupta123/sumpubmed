BACKGROUND
voltage-dependent l-type ca2+ channels  are essential for the initiation and regulation of excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle. in addition, ca2+ entry through v-ltcc channels can also serve as a second messenger to modulate regulatory protein kinases, calmodulin and beta-adrenergic responses  <cit> . genetic mutation of key ca2+ homeostasis proteins is frequently associated with defects in both cardiac cell differentiation and contractility, suggesting ca2+ signaling is essential for normal cardiac development  <cit> . ca2+ signals can also contribute to the control of gene expression  <cit> . ca2+ influx through v-ltcc can dramatically affect the phosphorylation, activity, or expression of many genes  <cit> . these data support the hypothesis that ca2+ signaling through v-ltcc impacts not only cardiac contraction but also embryonic cardiac growth and morphology, physiology, and gene expression.

v-ltccs are oligomeric proteins composed of a pore-forming α <dig> subunit and up to four auxiliary subunits, termed α <dig>  β, γ, and δ, associated in a 1:1:1: <dig> stoichiometry  <cit> . mammals encode  <dig> distinct α <dig> subunit genes  and four distinct β subunit genes . particular α <dig> and β subtypes are able to associate non-exclusively to form heterogeneous channels  <cit> . v-ltcc that contain the α1c subunit  constitute the vast majority of l-type channels expressed in adult cardiac muscle  <cit> .

the v-ltcc β subunit genes have important functions in cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle, the central nervous system and the retina  <cit> . β subunits modulate ca2+ channel function in two distinct ways. first, they facilitate transport of the α <dig> to the plasmalemma. in addition, they interact with α <dig> to modulate both the kinetics and voltage-sensitivity of the channels  <cit> . as members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase  family, the v-ltcc β subunit genes include conserved sh <dig> and guanylate kinase  domains connected by a bridging region termed the hook domain  <cit> . the larger maguk protein family appears to be specific to metazoans, and its core structure, including the sh <dig> and gk domains, can be traced back to early metazoan history  <cit> . all known β genes undergo alternative splicing of 5' exons, and some exhibit alternative splicing of internal exons as well  <cit> . alternative splicing in internal exons can create truncated proteins, some of which have been shown to mediate calcium channel-independent functions in the cell  <cit> .

in the mouse, the earliest documented expression of a cardiac β protein is a western blot showing β <dig> protein in the linear heart tube   <cit> . by e <dig>  , β <dig> and β <dig> mrna and protein are clearly present in the embryonic myocardium  <cit> . β <dig> and β <dig> proteins show detectable differences in spatial distribution as early as e <dig> , which become more pronounced in mid- to late embryogenesis  and in later fetal development  <cit> . in rat postnatal development , rt-pcr studies indicate all four β subunits are expressed in cardiac tissue, though they differ in abundance  <cit> . significantly, by  <dig>  weeks rna from atria and ventricles show different β subunit rt-pcr expression profiles  <cit> . in brain and heart, newborn and juvenile animals express different subsets of β genes  than the adult  <cit> . the physiological significance of these observations is not known. however, a recent report describing the targeted mutagenesis of mouse β <dig> indicated that homozygous loss of this gene  is embryonic lethal at e <dig> , significantly earlier than the α1c-deficient mouse  <cit> . no up-regulation of other β subunits was observed in β2-/- mutants. in β2-/- mutant mice, cardiac contractility is severely compromised and v-ltcc currents diminished. hearts in mutant mice exhibit severe bradycardia and vascular patterning defects, but these phenotypes may be secondary to severe morphological defects that develop in the heart or to the overall reduced embryonic growth  <cit> . in contrast to β <dig>  mice with null mutations in β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> have no reported cardiac phenotypes  <cit> . however, the zebrafish β1-/- mutant relaxed develops pericardial edema and reduced circulation at  <dig> dpf , suggesting a possible compromise in cardiac function  <cit> . thus, while multiple β subunits are clearly present in the embryonic heart, much remains to be learned about their functional roles in development.

as a model for the study of β subunit developmental function in the heart, zebrafish has several advantages, including the external fertilization of embryos and rapid, transparent development of the larvae, which allows experimental access to the developing heart and circulatory system. moreover, for about the first  <dig> days of development the small zebrafish larvae subsist on oxygen acquired via diffusion, enabling them to survive without a functional heart  <cit> . as a first step in establishing a zebrafish model, we cloned two β <dig> subunit gene homologs from zebrafish. we find one β <dig> subunit is much more similar than the other to known vertebrate β <dig> subunits. significant alternative splicing occurs involving several atg-containing first exons in both zebrafish genes, as well as two other teleost species. the separation of these short exons by extremely large introns suggests potential independent cis-regulatory control of alternatively spliced transcripts. unexpectedly, both β <dig> subunits were maternally expressed, consistent with possible early roles for this gene in morphogenetic movements or patterning. additionally, both genes showed evidence of tissue-, stage- and transcript-specific regulatory control in embryos and adults.

RESULTS
identification of zebrafish and pufferfish calcium channel β <dig> subunit  genes
tblastn searches of the genbank database at ncbi using human β <dig> subunit sequences suggested that zebrafish encode two β <dig> homologues  <cit> . we therefore designed primers to highly conserved sequences within the sh <dig> and gk protein domains, and performed 5' and 3' race-pcr on rna extracted from embryos aged 1– <dig> dpf. using race and reverse-transcriptase pcr , we isolated cdnas representing two zebrafish β <dig> genes, termed β <dig>  and β <dig>  . the β <dig>  gene showed a near perfect match with genomic sequences located within genbank zebrafish chromosome  <dig> , whereas β <dig>  matched genomic sequences found on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> . alternative splicing occurred at the n-terminus for both genes and within the hook domain for β <dig>  . in the initial race analysis for β <dig> , we recovered four β <dig> _tv <dig> clones, and five β <dig> _tv <dig> clones, suggesting these may be the most abundant transcript variants. one clone each was found for the β <dig> _tv <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts, suggesting they may be less abundant. for β <dig> , we recovered two β <dig> _tv <dig> and three β <dig> _tv <dig> 5' race clones. in additional rt-pcr analysis using primers closely flanking the hook domain, we confirmed that β <dig>  transcript variants containing more than one exon between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  could be detected in the rna samples . conversely, we confirmed that no alternative splicing occurred in the β <dig>  hook domain . several 3' race clones were of a single variant for β <dig>  and a single variant for β <dig> , suggesting that no alternative splicing occurred in the gk or c-terminal regions of the genes.

to better assess the conservation of the new genes, we performed a comparative search for orthologous β <dig> sequences in the pufferfish tetraodon nigrovidis and fugu rubripes genomes  <cit> . we identified a single β <dig> subunit gene in each pufferfish genome . all four teleost β <dig> genes contained highly conserved sh <dig> and gk domains characteristic of maguk family proteins . the size and number of exons comprising these domains are nearly identical in teleosts and mammals . pairwise comparisons of amino acid sequences within these core  domains, using the most similar transcript variants available, indicated the zebrafish β <dig> , fugu and tetraodon β <dig> genes shared ~87% identity with other vertebrate β <dig> genes . we extended this analysis to five teleost species by including ests or proteins derived from genomic sequences. three crystallographic studies on mammalian cacnb genes have identified a total of  <dig> amino acid residues as critical for interaction of the β subunit with the α subunit aid . in our five different teleost species, we observed that all  <dig> residues were nearly 100% conserved with mammals   <cit> .

in contrast, the more divergent zebrafish β <dig>  core region shares only ~62% amino acid identity . the most extreme sequence divergence in the zebrafish β <dig>  gene occurs at the 5' end of the gene, both 5' of and within the sh <dig> domain, although high levels of divergence exist throughout the entire protein. we identified a single est, termed dw <dig>  from three-spined stickleback as a possible ortholog to the zebrafish β <dig>  gene. within the core domain, dw <dig> is 74% identical to zebrafish β <dig>   but only 52% identical to zebrafish β <dig>  . in addition, dw <dig> maps to a genomic contig, aanh <dig> , which contains sequences homologous to zebrafish β <dig>  exon  <dig>  and β <dig>  exon  <dig> . in the β <dig>  gene, regions of high divergence encompass sequences both within and outside of inferred secondary structures  <cit> . nevertheless,  <dig> of  <dig> β subunit residues noted for interaction with the α subunit aid are conserved in zebrafish β <dig>    <cit> . high sequence divergence in β <dig>  relative to other vertebrate β genes is reflected in the branch lengths on the phylogeny . this pattern contrasts with that seen in the β <dig> group, where the two zebrafish paralogs have experienced similar rates of amino acid substitution.

alignment of residues in the c terminus of the β subunit genes shows that sequences 3' to the gk domain are not highly conserved even among the teleost species . it has previously been noted among multiple vertebrate β subunit genes that the c terminal regions are not highly conserved. specific functions for c terminal domains are poorly defined, although studies of truncated β <dig> proteins suggest the c terminus could contribute to protein function  <cit> .

alternative splicing at the n terminus and within the hook domain
the zebrafish β <dig>  and β <dig>  genes undergo alternative splicing within the n-terminus and within the internal hook domain . the β <dig>  and β <dig>  genes each encode two mutually exclusive n termini . zebrafish β <dig>  and β <dig> , as well as the tetraodon and fugu β <dig> genes, share some 5' exons in common with mammals . in contrast, the β <dig>  exon  <dig> sequence could not be found in any mammalian, xenopus or chick databases, but was present in the tetraodon and fugu genomes, suggesting this exon may be specific to teleosts . the β <dig>  exon  <dig> was found only in one other sequence, the stickleback est dw <dig>  although the small size of this exon  could make it difficult to recognize if it had diverged in other species . additional 5' exons occur in mammals that were not observed in any teleost cdnas or in genomic sequences available to date, although the limitation of this analysis is that complete genomic sequences are not available for all teleost species examined, and that our data relies in part on genome mining rather than extensive cdna analysis. however, our data support the hypothesis that each of the teleost β <dig> loci have evolved to contain a unique combination of 5' exons, each of which is predicted to encode an alternative protein n-terminus.

alternative splicing also occurs internally for one zebrafish β <dig> subunit gene. β <dig>  encodes three alternatively spliced hook domain exons . the high conservation of β <dig>  exons  <dig> and  <dig> with mammalian counterparts , and exon  <dig> with several other teleost genes , suggests that these internal sequences could have functional relevance. the β <dig>  exon  <dig>  which appears to be unique to zebrafish, includes a premature in-frame stop codon expected to truncate the protein in the hook domain . in β <dig>  transcripts that contain both exon  <dig> and  <dig>  the reading frame is altered such that a premature in-frame stop codon truncates the protein in exon  <dig> 

no alternative splicing was observed for β <dig>  transcripts in the hook domain; instead, all variants encode a short exon  specific to fish that contains several positively charged residues . likewise, the tetraodon and fugu genomes contain only one recognizably homologous exon , similar to human exon  <dig> . the variety of β <dig> transcript variants is expected to encode an array of different β <dig> subunit proteins in teleosts.

the large size of 5' introns
remarkably, the introns that separate the first few 5' exons of the β <dig> loci are among the largest introns known in the zebrafish, pufferfish or human genomes. each tetraodon and fugu β <dig> locus contains one intron over  <dig> kb, a size that ranks within the top 5% of the largest introns in pufferfish  <cit> . in addition, the two pufferfish genes, the stickleback β <dig> -like gene, and both zebrafish β <dig>  and β <dig>  each contain introns of >  <dig> bp that separate 5'-most exons . in pufferfish, the modal value for intron size is  <dig> bp, with 75% of introns <  <dig> bp in length  <cit> . given the compact nature of the pufferfish genomes  <cit> , it was not surprising that introns of the human β <dig> locus exceeded the size of those in fish. nevertheless, the trend of megasized introns in the n-terminus of β <dig> loci extends to the human genome. three giant introns ranging in size from 60– <dig> kb each separate the human β <dig> exons in the n-terminus. thus, when human exon  <dig> is spliced to exon  <dig> , the splicing machinery must exclude over  <dig> kb of intronic sequence. in contrast, introns in the remaining part of the human β <dig> gene averaged  <dig> bp in size. in humans, the mean size of introns adjoining coding sequences is  <dig> bp, but 75% of introns are smaller than  <dig> bp  <cit> . a recent analysis of the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana, drosophila, mouse and human indicated that the median sizes of introns separating 5' utr  sequence are significantly larger than introns separating coding sequence  <cit> . even so, the median size of human 5' utr introns  is still much smaller than the human 5' β <dig> introns, which separate coding sequences.

divergence of the calcium channel β <dig> genes in zebrafish
we used clustalw software to align the β <dig> subunit core domain amino acid sequences and treepuzzle and paup* to construct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony, respectively  <cit> . by using only core domains , we minimized differences due to alternative splicing . the fugu and tetraodon β <dig> subunit genes, zebrafish β <dig> , zebrafish β <dig> , and other vertebrate β <dig> genes form a monophyletic group . the sequence of β <dig>  is substantially more diverged from other vertebrate β <dig> genes than is β <dig> , both in amino acid replacements  and insertions/deletions. portions of the gene were sufficiently divergent to be essentially random in sequence with respect to all other taxa, and the region 5' of the sh <dig> domain also contained an 18-amino acid deletion. no convincing region of synteny could be established between any of the teleost β <dig> genes and human β <dig>  despite the fact that human chromosome  <dig> and mouse chromosome  <dig> share a region of synteny inclusive of the β <dig> genes. thus, a syntenic approach was not useful to confirm or refute the orthology of zebrafish β <dig>  or β <dig>  with mammalian β <dig> genes.

heterogeneity of calcium channel β <dig> expression in the embryo and adult
to determine whether β <dig> genes are expressed in a stage- or tissue-specific manner in early embryogenesis, we performed rt-pcr on rna isolated from embryos of several stages in early development. to track the expression patterns of specific transcript variants , we used forward primers specific to the 5' exons  <dig> or  <dig>  and reverse primers in exon  <dig>  in rt-pcr experiments . surprisingly, amplification of β <dig>  and β <dig>  transcripts occurred in embryos as young as the 4-cell and 1000-cell stages . since zebrafish zygotic transcription does not initiate until the 10th cell division   <cit> , the presence of mrna in 4-cell embryos indicates that the transcripts are of maternal origin. the β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig> was expressed steadily from the 4-cell stage through  <dig> hours post-fertilization . in contrast, β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig> showed a pulse of expression in early epiboly stages. β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig> was robustly detected from  <dig> hpf through at least  <dig> dpf. other β <dig>  transcript variants  were detected more sporadically or were undetectable in this assay, consistent with their rare recovery in race reactions. thus, both β <dig>  and β <dig>  are expressed from the earliest stages of embryogenesis, but show significant heterogeneity in patterns of transcript variant expression throughout the first three days of embryogenesis.

to determine which transcript variants of the zebrafish β <dig> genes are expressed in the embryonic heart, we performed rt-pcr on rna extracted from cardiac tissue at  <dig> hpf . these data indicate that only a subset of β <dig>  and β <dig>  transcript variants are expressed in the embryonic heart relative to the adult heart. in humans, at least seven β <dig> transcript variants are expressed in the heart, including β2a and β2e  <cit> . in zebrafish, the β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig>  was expressed only in the embryo, whereas the β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig>  was expressed in the adult but not embryonic heart.

the expression of β <dig> subunits in several adult organs or tissues was assayed. in most adult tissues, we observed transcript variant-specific patterns of expression for the β <dig>  and β <dig>  genes . mutually exclusive expression of β <dig>  transcript variants  <dig> and  <dig> occurred in the heart and brain, respectively. some other tissues express more than one β <dig>  transcript variant. many adult tissues express both β <dig>  transcript variants  <dig> and  <dig>  but a few tissues  expressed only β <dig>  transcript variant  <dig>  thus, adult tissues also show significant heterogeneity in expression of β <dig> subunit transcript variants.

discussion
teleost calcium channel β subunits and embryonic development
we have identified four new calcium channel β <dig> subunits in teleosts, including two in zebrafish and one gene each in the fugu and tetraodon genomes. like the mammalian calcium channel β subunits, the four teleost β <dig> subunit genes encode characteristic maguk family proteins, with sh <dig> and gk domains that are highly conserved with other vertebrates. we show that several alternatively spliced transcripts arise from both β <dig>  and β <dig>  subunits, which are expressed in the embryo and adult but subject to both temporal and spatial regulation. only selected transcript variants of each β <dig> subunit gene are expressed in the embryonic heart, and these differ from adult transcript variants. thus, the heterogeneity of β subunits and their transcript variants in teleost species is extensive.

gene structure of teleost calcium channel β <dig> subunits
alternative splicing occurs within the n-terminus as well as internally in the β <dig>  and β <dig>  subunit genes. notably, each zebrafish β <dig> subunit gene encodes at least two mutually exclusive 5' exons, each with a separate translation initiation site. each gene has one 5' exon conserved with mammals, and one 5' exon unique to fish. similarly, some of the internal alternatively spliced exons are similar to those in mammals, while others are unique to teleosts. this variety of transcript variants potentially encodes an array of different β <dig> subunit proteins. previous studies have demonstrated that 5' variation due to alternative splicing can be functionally significant in β subunits. when expressed in hek  <dig> cells, human 5' β <dig> subunit variants β2a and β2e  showed differential sub-cellular localization compared to transcript variants β2b, β2c and β2d   <cit> . moreover, the five human 5' β <dig> subunit variants differentially affected open probability, peak current and availability of l-type channels  <cit> . likewise, in xenopus oocyte expression studies, human β <dig> subunits with alternatively spliced n-termini showed functionally distinct electrophysiological properties  <cit> . domain swapping experiments further indicate the functional significance of the n-terminal sequences in β subunit proteins. replacing the β1b n-terminus with β2a n-terminus created a chimeric β protein with slow inactivation kinetics  <cit> . conversely, replacing β2a n-terminus with the non-palmitoylated β <dig> n-terminus created a chimeric β protein with β3-like inactivation kinetics  <cit> . post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or palmitoylation, present on exons near the n-terminus, may account for some of the functional diversity, although this functional relationship has been experimentally demonstrated for only a few genes to date  <cit> . intriguingly, a recent report indicates that the length of the β <dig> n-terminus is, independent of sequence, an important factor in mediating the magnitude of channel modulation  <cit> . further functional studies using the zebrafish model system will be necessary to determine whether the array of zebrafish β <dig> subunit proteins indeed have different biochemical functions within the cell.

a curious feature of at least five species of teleost β <dig> subunit genes, as well as the human β <dig> subunit gene, is that some of the largest introns of the genome separate the several short, alternatively spliced 5' coding exons. do these large introns have any adaptive significance for β <dig> subunit biology? in several instances, introns have been shown to incorporate enhancer or repressor elements that influence transcription  <cit> . expanding this idea, we propose that the unusual β <dig> gene structure may provide a mechanism for independent cis-regulation of each transcript variant; that is, sequences within individual introns might independently direct the tissue and temporally-specific expression of transcript variants utilizing the associated atg-containing 5' exon. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that transcript variant-specific patterns of expression do in fact occur in both embryo and adult. however, it is increasingly becoming appreciated that, beyond regulatory elements, introns can impact mrna metabolism in a number of other ways. potential effects include modulating transcription rates by regulating dna accessibility, modulating editing and polyadenylation of the pre-mrna, and affecting nuclear export, translation and mrna decay rates  <cit> .

the inclusion of different subsets of 5' exons  among each of the pufferfish or zebrafish β <dig> subunit genes is interesting from an evolutionary standpoint. a canonical view is that variations in protein structure and function form the basis of evolutionary innovation and phenotypic divergence. however, as more genomes are sequenced and annotated, it is becoming evident that alternative splicing substantially increases the proteome in many species. . a corollary to this hypothesis is that the regulatory circuitry regulating alternative splicing or the expression of particular transcript variants is also an important source of evolutionary innovation  <cit> . the mechanisms by which new introns arise during evolution, and the impact of large intron size per se on cis-regulation or other adaptive phenomena, remain actively debated areas of research  <cit> .

the evolutionary origin of the duplicated calcium channel β <dig> subunit genes
zebrafish β <dig> duplication may be the consequence of a genome-wide duplication thought to have occurred in teleosts approximately  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . alternatively, duplication could be the result of an ancient region-specific duplication. the β <dig> subunit gene does not appear to be duplicated in either the fugu or tetraodon genomes. the existence of single β <dig> subunit homologs was of itself not particularly surprising since phylogeny and synteny data suggest that the common ancestor of zebrafish and pufferfish underwent a large-scale gene or complete genome duplication event  <cit> . subsequently, pufferfish may have lost many duplicates that were retained in the zebrafish  <cit> . data from the other β gene paralog groups  are equivocal, as zebrafish have one described copy of β <dig> and two copies of β <dig>  <cit> . the fate of most duplicated genes is the accumulation of degenerative mutations in coding or regulatory regions that leads to gene loss or silencing  <cit> . alternatively, genes may acquire separable patterns of expression or separable functions that then require the maintenance of functional copies of both genes in the genome   <cit> . since the two zebrafish β <dig> genes are both robustly but differentially expressed, our data are more consistent with subfunctionalization.

developmental expression patterns of calcium channel β <dig> subunit transcript variants
calcium is an important signal in the embryo even prior to gastrulation  <cit> . calcium gradients, waves and pulses have been described in the blastula and early gastrula that may represent key pattern forming events. the mechanism underlying these calcium signals, and whether they encompass voltage-gated calcium channels, is not clear. surprisingly, both β <dig> subunits show maternal as well as the early zygotic expression of several transcript variants. our recent study of two zebrafish β <dig> subunits, which are also expressed maternally and zygotically in the gastrulating embryo, indicates that these genes are essential for normal epiboly. initially, we predicted that β subunits might be involved in the gastrulating embryo voltage-gated calcium channel-related functions. however, our study showed that the zebrafish β <dig> subunits, at least, operate independently of voltage-gated calcium channels in mediating epiboly  <cit> .

in addition to possible early roles, we find that expression of β <dig>  or β <dig>  is under strong temporal control in the post-gastrula embryo and in adult tissues. of particular interest, given the cardiac lethality observed in mouse β2-deficient embryos, is the observation of differential subsets of β <dig>  and β <dig>  transcript variants expressed in the embryonic and adult heart. this observation supports the hypothesis, previously proposed by others, that the heterogeneity of β subunit transcript variant expression within the heart may provide a mechanism for fine-tuning the cardiac voltage-activated current as the organism progresses through embryonic, juvenile and adult stages  <cit> . in addition, the expression levels of particular β <dig> transcript variants has also been linked to pathophysiology of heart failure in humans  <cit> . clearly, the first step in interpreting the function of β subunits in any model system is simply to understand when and where the various transcript variants are expressed.

CONCLUSIONS
the primary novel findings of this study are as follows: 1) we have cloned two new β <dig> subunit genes in zebrafish, one of which is phylogenetically quite divergent in amino acid sequence. they are classified as maguk proteins on the basis of high conservation with mammalian maguk core regions. 2) alternative splicing occurs at the β <dig> n-termini and internally. a comparative analysis showed that a subset of 5' exons present in several teleosts species is shared with mammals, while a different subset appears to be unique to teleosts. 3) some of the largest introns in the human or teleost genomes separate the small, alternatively spliced 5' exons of β <dig> genes, leading us to hypothesize that β subunit transcript variant expression may be under independent cis-regulatory control. 4) the zebrafish β <dig> genes are expressed maternally and zygotically in the gastrulating embryo and show strong evidence of temporal and spatial regulation in embryogenesis and in adults. 5) only a subset of β <dig> subunit transcript variants is expressed in the embryonic heart, and they differ from those expressed in the adult heart. in sum, this work provides the groundwork for a study of functional aspects of β <dig> subunit biology. the high degree of temporal and spatial control of β subunits, combined with recently identified non-canonical functions for particular β subunits or transcript variants, suggests that a functional analysis of these genes would provide intriguing insight.
