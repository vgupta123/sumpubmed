BACKGROUND
seven cullins have been identified in mammalian cells ; each cullin assembles a unique set of ubiquitin ligase complexes that catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chains to signal the degradation of target proteins by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway
 <cit> . the three best-characterized cullins, cul <dig>  cul <dig>  and cul <dig>  form diverse groups of ubiquitin ligase complexes with different sets of substrate recognition modules. for instance, cul <dig> forms an skp1-cullin-f-box  complex that acquires substrate specificity via two proteins: a skp <dig> linker protein and a substrate adaptor protein containing an f-box domain
 <cit> . likewise, cul <dig> forms an elongin-cul2-socs-box  ubiquitin ligase complex with a ubiquitin-like protein elongin b, a skp1-like linker protein elongin c and a substrate adaptor socs-box containing protein
 <cit> . conversely, cul <dig> forms a btb-cul3-rbx <dig>  ubiquitin ligase complex, in which a btb domain-containing protein serves as both a linker and a substrate adaptor module
 <cit> . it is estimated that more than  <dig> btb domain-containing proteins are expressed in human cells, which could accommodate a very large number of substrates for the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex
 <cit> .

previous studies have uncovered new substrates and unique components of cullin ubiquitin ligase complexes that suggest new mechanisms for substrate recruitment
 <cit> . for example, ddb <dig> was originally identified as a substrate adaptor that bound to the n-terminus of the cul4a complex using its one β-propeller domain , while utilizing the double-β-propeller domain  to provide substrate specificity for the cul4a ubiquitin ligase complex
 <cit> . however, a study using mass spectrometry analysis of the cul4a complex has identified a group of wd <dig> domain-containing proteins called dwd that can bind to both cul4a and ddb <dig>  these dwd proteins were later shown to serve as additional substrate adaptors for the cul4a complex
 <cit> . because of the functional similarity between ddb <dig> and btb domain-containing proteins, this finding suggests a possibility that the substrate adaptor component of the bcr complex may not be limited to btb domain-containing proteins.

here we performed tandem affinity purification  followed by multidimensional protein identification technology  mass spectrometry to identify new components of the bcr complex. several known cul3-binding proteins and substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex were identified by this method. in an attempt to rapidly analyze the potential of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex from this list of proteins, we modified the parameters in the sequest algorithm so that it would recognize the peptide sequence with a lysine residue that is attached to two glycine residues on its side chain, which is indicative of a protein that has been conjugated to ubiquitin or a ubiquitin-like molecule prior to the tryptic digest.

in addition to many known cul <dig> binding proteins and new substrates, identified by remnants of conjugated ubiquitin, we have identified two classes of cul3-bound proteins with either leucine-rich repeats  or a wd <dig> domain, which will be referred to as clws in this study.

RESULTS
tandem affinity purification of in vivo cul <dig> complexes
in this study, a combination of tandem affinity purification  and mudpit mass spectrometry were used to identify new members of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex. to obtain highly purified cul <dig> complexes, an expression cassette encoding a flag-tev-cbp-cul <dig> fusion protein was constructed so that the cul <dig> complex could be purified using anti-flag sepharose beads and calmodulin-conjugated beads . the size and expression levels of the flag-tev-cbp-cul <dig> fusion protein were verified by immunoblotting and probing against either anti-cul <dig> antibody or anti-flag antibody . as the proportion of neddylated to unneddylated cul <dig> was roughly the same in endogenous cul <dig> and overexpressed cul <dig> , we reasoned that these purified cul <dig> complexes would likely to be part of a functional bcr ubiquitin ligase complex rather than a free cul <dig> monomer, and thus we proceeded with our experiment. the cul <dig> complexes were purified with anti-flag sepharose beads and tev protease cleavage, where the lack of protein bands in the flag immunoblot confirmed that the flag-tag had been cleaved off the eluted cul <dig> complexes . subsequently, the cbp-cul <dig> complexes were purified with calmodulin-conjugated beads .

data analysis on the ms/ms spectra and potential binding proteins of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex
five independent mudpit experiments were performed for the cul <dig> fusion protein as well as one actin control. the sequest algorithm was set to match the experimentally obtained mass spectra with theoretical peptides from the human ncbi nr database, revealing a total of  <dig>  peptides from the purified actin control  and  <dig>  peptides from the purified cul <dig> complexes 
 <cit> . low quality spectra with a mass error greater than 20 ppm, low xcorr values , and other known contaminants were discarded. the resulting peptides were categorized into two groups based on the number of peptide sequences that match the predicted protein. the first group of cul3-binding protein includes proteins that were either identified by at least two different peptide sequences or known cul3-binding proteins that were identified with at least one peptide sequence in this study, such as cand <dig>  nedd <dig>  klhl <dig>  rpn <dig>  and rpn <dig> . the second group of potential cul3-binding proteins was identified via mass spectra of one peptide sequence, which required additional manual validation of the ms/ms spectra as well as further biochemical analysis to confirm their interactions with cul <dig> complexes . this list includes proteins that may be involved in the ubiquitination pathway, such as pvhl-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme  <dig>  stip <dig> homology and u-box containing protein  <dig>  and ubiquitin specific proteases.

identification of leucine-rich repeats and wd <dig> domain-containing proteins as cul <dig> binding proteins
proteins that corresponded to the identified peptide spectra were subjected to the domain prediction program cdart and categorized based on conserved domains
 <cit> . when compared with the list of proteins identified from purified actin complexes, we observed enrichment for proteins that contain wd <dig> domains and leucine-rich repeats  in the purified cul <dig> data set with the percent enrichment scores of  <dig> % of wd <dig> domain and  <dig> % for lrr domain-containing proteins in the cul3-bound complex in contrast to  <dig> % of wd <dig> domain and  <dig> % of the lrr domain-containing protein in the actin-bound complex . because domain enrichment maybe indicative of preferential binding between the bcr complex and proteins with lrr/wd <dig> domains, we chose to further explore the role of these lrr/wd <dig> domains in the mammalian bcr complex.

the leucine-rich repeats  and wd <dig> domain-containing proteins  bind cul3
three leucine-rich repeat proteins ) and two wd <dig> domain-containing proteins  were cloned from the list of  <dig> mudpit-identified cul3-bound proteins with lrr or wd <dig> domains  to verify their binding to cul <dig>  the cdnas were fully sequenced and cloned into mammalian expression vectors in frame with the ha-tag. the proteins were co-expressed with flag-tagged cul <dig> . immunoprecipitation assays revealed that flag-cul <dig> was able to specifically bind the ha-tagged clws with either the lrr  or the wd <dig> domains , which further confirms the results from the proteomic analysis.

cul <dig> mutants that cannot bind btb domain-containing proteins have enhanced binding to lrrs
to clarify how other cul <dig> binding proteins affect or regulate the binding of lrrs to cul <dig>  we tested a variety of cul <dig> mutants that were unable to bind various cul <dig> binding partners. mutants that could not be neddylated  or could not bind rbx <dig>  were able to bind the lrr proteins in an identical fashion to wild type cul <dig> . surprisingly, mutants that could not bind btb domain-containing proteins  showed enhanced binding to both lrr <dig> and lrr <dig> . this observation led us to investigate a possible interaction between lrrs and btb domain-containing proteins.

lrrs bind to btb domain-containing proteins
based on our observation that removal of the btb binding region of cul <dig> enhanced lrr binding we hypothesized that they may either have overlapping binding sites on cul <dig> or interact with each other. to test this hypothesis, we examined ctb73
 <cit> , also called btbd1
 <cit>  , which is a btb domain-containing protein previously shown to mediate substrate binding to cul <dig>  for its ability to bind to lrr <dig> and lrr <dig> . in both cases, ctb <dig> bound specifically to the lrrs. to further map the regions of interaction, we deleted the btb domain on ctb <dig>  unexpectedly; this form of ctb <dig> showed enhanced binding to the lrrs. we confirmed this enhanced binding with a different combination of lrrs and btb domain-containing protein mutants . these results imply that there is a secondary interaction region outside the btb domain that mediates binding between lrrs and btb domain-containing proteins.to further dissect the binding interaction between ctb <dig> and lrrs, we created several ctb <dig> deletion mutants, one of which has a deleted region n-terminal to the btb domain , which is extremely proline rich  . we also examined binding between lrr <dig> and the ctb <dig> deletion mutants without the btb domain, the back domain and the kelch domain. though each domain deletion failed to completely disrupt the binding, we observed slight reduction between the binding of the ctb73Δ2- <dig> mutant and lrrs . we speculated that the reason we could not completely eliminate binding between ctb <dig> and lrr <dig> was that they both were able to bind cul <dig> and therefore bridging of cul <dig> caused the remaining binding.

cul <dig> forms a complex with a btb/kelch domain-containing protein and a lrr domain-containing protein
based on our observations that lrrs bind to cul <dig> and btb domain-containing proteins, as well as prior knowledge that cul <dig> binds btb domain-containing proteins, we wanted to determine if the three proteins co-existed within the same complex. flag-cul <dig> with a tev protease cleavage site  was co-expressed with myc-ctb <dig> and ha-lrr <dig>  flag-beads were used to purify the cul <dig> complex, which were subsequently treated with tev protease to release the protein complex from the beads. the resulting soluble proteins were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with myc antibody to pull down myc-ctb <dig>  the resulting protein complexes were analyzed by western blot analysis to detect the presence of the third protein, ha-lrr <dig>  two sequential affinity purifications of flag-cul <dig> and myc-ctb <dig> pulled down significant amounts ha-lrr <dig> only in the presence of all three proteins . these data verify our hypothesis that cul <dig>  a btb-domain containing protein and an lrr could co-exist within the same complex.because our results in figures 
 <dig> and
 <dig> suggested a potential for overlapping or co-regulation of binding between btb domain-containing proteins and lrrs on cul <dig>  we also compared complex formation on wild type cul <dig> versus the mutant that cannot bind btb domain-containing proteins . we observed a slight increase in the binding between the lrrs and the cul <dig> mutant when compared to wild type , which further supports a overlapping binding model.

a b/c-like box sequence mediates lrr binding to cul <dig> complexes
as several lrrs are very small and the lrr domain dominates the coding sequence, we began determining the regions on the lrrs that mediate interactions with cul <dig> and/or the btb domain-containing proteins. in this case, the deletion of lrr domain would not be informative because the remaining portion would be short peptides that were unlikely to fold properly. we could not find any conserved regions outside of the lrr domains that were shared by the identified lrr domain containing proteins. further examination however revealed a sequence adjacent to the lrr domain that strongly resembles a b/c box . to determine if this sequence may be playing a role in the interaction between the lrr domain containing proteins and cul <dig> complexes, we created i330g c334a mutations in the putative b/c-like box of the lrr <dig>  and tested its binding to cul <dig>  and ctb <dig> . when compared with wild-type lrr <dig>  we observed that the lrr5-b/c mutant showed enhanced binding to wild type cul <dig> . however, the lrr-b/c interaction with cul3Δ51- <dig> mutant that could not bind btb domain was completely eliminated, though this form of cul <dig> mutant showed enhanced binding to wild type lrrs . additionally, the binding between the lrr5-b/c mutant and various ctb <dig> deletion mutants were examined. we observed that lrr5-b/c mutant maintained the same binding interaction with wild-type ctb <dig> and most of the deletion mutants . however, the binding interaction between the lrr5-b/c mutant and the ctb73Δ2- <dig> was eliminated , indicating that this b/c-like box is the major mediator of binding the lrr domain-containing protein to the btb domain-containing protein. this b/c-like box binds the n-terminal sequence  on the btb domain containing protein. in addition, the residual binding between ctb73Δ2- <dig> and wild type lrr <dig> was due to bridging via cul <dig>  we speculated that the enhanced binding of the lrr-b/c-like box mutant to wild type cul <dig> was due to the reduced interaction between the lrr-b/c mutant and a btb domain-containing protein in the complex, thus eliminating the interaction we have previously shown to regulate lrrs binding to cul <dig>  consistent with this model, lrr5-b/c does not show enhanced binding to the version of ctb <dig> that is missing its btb domain, unlike wild-type lrr <dig> . a graphical summary of these interactions is shown in figure 
4e.

fmod  causes fazf to become degraded
in order to determine the potential cellular role for these complexes that contain a btb domain-containing protein, an lrr domain-containing protein and cul <dig>  we performed two hybrid screens using lrr <dig> as bait. after screening greater than a million clones we identified only one strong binding partner, fazf. fazf is a btb domain-containing protein that has been shown to be important in transcriptional regulation of b-cell differentiation
 <cit> . this was a surprise since we have seen lrr <dig> bind several btb domain-containing proteins, and the library we used contains many btb domain-containing proteins
 <cit> . in order to determine specificity and verify these two proteins bind in mammalian cells lrr <dig> was co-expressed with either fazf or the highly similar protein plzf
 <cit>  . interestingly, lrr <dig> bound fazf and not plzf and also appeared to cause a reduction in expression levels of fazf . we therefore felt that the binding interaction was potentially biologically significant. fazf overexpression has been shown to cause g <dig> arrest and apoptosis in b cell lines
 <cit> , in addition lrr <dig>  is highly overexpressed in some types of leukemias
 <cit> . enforced down regulation of lrr <dig> in these leukemias also results in apoptosis
 <cit> . based on this observation and on our previous data regarding the relationship between lrr <dig> binding cul <dig> and btb domain-containing proteins, we postulated that lrr <dig> might be involved in regulating the levels of the btb domain-containing protein fazf. we reasoned that a complex of all three might convert the btb domain-containing protein to a substrate instead of a substrate adaptor by modulating how it binds to cul <dig>  consistent with the proposed hypothesis, the reduced levels of fazf caused by coexpression of both lrr <dig> and fazf could be restored by inhibiting the proteasome with mg- <dig> . we then focused on a potential for lrr <dig> to modulate expression levels of endogenous fazf using a well-characterized antibody against fazf
 <cit> . we found that high expression of lrr <dig> dramatically reduced endogenous levels of fazf . as lrr <dig> levels were decreased using coexpression of shrna against lrr <dig>  the levels of fazf increase demonstrating an inverse relationship between expression of lrr <dig> and fazf. an analogous experiment in which lrr <dig> was coexpressed with shrna against lrr <dig> showed no change in endogenous fazf levels . from these data we conclude that lrr <dig> negatively regulates levels of endogenous fazf, similar to the regulation we saw with coexpression.

a method to characterize potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex by mass spectrometry
the identification of known substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex, such as mei <dig> and glur <dig>  by our mudpit analysis led to the hypothesis that some of the newly identified cul3-binding proteins are protein substrates targeted for ubiquitination by the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex. a large number of cul3-binding proteins in this study made it impossible to individually analyze these potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex. therefore, we searched for a screening method that would identify a large number of potential substrates in a short period of time. we, and others, have previously observed that cul <dig> and protein substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex could be co-purified by an immunoprecipitation assay
 <cit> , which led us to speculate that some substrates may remain bound to the cul <dig> complex in their ubiquitinated form. in this analysis, purified cul <dig> complexes were digested with trypsin, yielding a mixture of ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated precursor peptides that were analyzed by the mass spectrometer. trypsin also cleaved conjugated ubiquitin molecules after the c-terminal lysine  <dig>  leaving two glycine residues attached to the protein substrate on the side chain of the ubiquitinated lysine. therefore, the mass of a tryptic peptide with a ubiquitinated lysine residue would also include the mass of two glycine residues from the c-terminal end of the conjugated ubiquitin, which would allow us to distinguish these potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex among hundreds of cul3-binding proteins.

in order to identify potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex, we modified the parameters of the sequest algorithm with a variable modification on lysine of 114 da, which is consistent with a gly-gly modification. this alternative analysis of the mass spectra has led to the identification of  <dig> potential substrates that were each identified by at least two peptide sequences and spectra with a mass error value of less than 20 ppm and a high xcorr value  . approximately 27% of the total potential cul3-binding proteins were conjugated with ubiquitin molecules, only  <dig> % of these proteins contain the predicted spectra that matched the mass spectra of both ubiquitin-conjugated and unconjugated peptides . furthermore, the sequest algorithm also distinguishes the position of the modified lysine residues within each precursor peptide. therefore, this mudpit approach not only identifies potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex in less time than traditional biochemical assays, it also predicts the ubiquitin conjugation sites on each potential substrate that would otherwise require many mutational analyses to obtain. based on our analysis, we observed that none of the clw proteins were identified by this method, thus further supporting our hypothesis that they are not substrates for the ubiquitination process, but rather part of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex.

to verify this algorithm for predicting potentially real ubiquitination sites, we mutated the predicted site on cul <dig>  based on our mudpit data indicating that the k <dig> residue on cul <dig> contains a ubiquitination site based on the extra mass that is equivalent to two glycine residues . biochemical analysis demonstrated that k <dig> was a genuine ubiquitination site for cul <dig> in cells .

discussion
since the discovery of cul <dig>  the characterization of the bcr ubiquitin ligase has progressed rapidly and has resulted in the identification of protein substrates and novel subunits of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex
 <cit> . in this study, a mudpit approach was chosen for the analysis of cul <dig> complexes to identify novel proteins that could be part of the cul3-dependent ubiquitination pathway. as a result, we have identified new members of the cul <dig> complex using two different approaches:  the identification of potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex and their ubiquitination sites by altering the criteria in the sequest algorithm to identify cul3-bound ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, and  the analysis of proteins with conserved domains among the mudpit-identified cul3-binding proteins that resulted in the characterization of previously unidentified cul3-bound proteins containing either lrr domains or wd <dig> domains .

based on our chemical analysis, we propose that the lrr domain-containing proteins  function to modify the binding of the btb domain containing protein to cul <dig> such that the btb domain containing protein becomes a substrate. lrrs bind to cul <dig> not only via the btb domain-containing protein, but also through other regions of the cul <dig> complex, as the cul <dig> mutant that cannot bind btb domain-containing proteins  can still bind lrrs. in addition, these cul3-bound lrrs were not ubiquitinated, suggesting they are unlikely to be substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex. this conclusion is further supported by the fact that substrates are unlikely to share a domain  because the mechanism of substrate recognition is usually based on short sequences
 <cit> .

lrr domain-containing proteins regulate binding between cul <dig> and btb-domain containing proteins
we discovered that the lrr domain-containing proteins modulated the binding of the btb domain-containing proteins binding to cul <dig> such that they became substrates instead of substrate adaptors. we found that a region on the btb domain-containing protein just n-terminal to the btb domain appears to be mediating the interaction with lrr domain-containing proteins. this region on ctb <dig> is extremely proline-rich; it is interesting to note that other btb domain proteins that have been shown to bind cul <dig> also have similar proline rich regions in their n-terminus, like actinfilin, btbd <dig>  and fazf . thus, this region may play a role in a number of other btb-domain protein/lrr-domain protein interactions. in addition the lrr domain-containing proteins contain a sequence that resembles a b/c box that mediates binding to the btb domain-containing proteins.

based on the identification of the wd <dig> domain in substrate adaptor subunits of the cul <dig> complex, we first proposed that our mudpit-identified wd <dig> domain-containing proteins also behave similarly in the cul <dig> complex. however, mutational analysis revealed that the interaction site for the wd <dig> domain-containing proteins lies within the conserved cullin domain in c-terminal region of cul <dig>  suggesting that their binding interactions did not resemble those found on the lrrs . therefore, the wd <dig> domain-containing proteins may function in a completely different way than the lrrs.

potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex identified by a method that involves an altered sequest algorithm
to distinguish novel cul3-binding proteins from potential substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex, we adjusted the parameters in the sequest algorithm to recognize the ubiquitin-modified lysine residue in the peptide spectra. manual validation of the mass spectra revealed that the altered sequest parameters could be used to identify ubiquitinated precursor peptides that are derived from the ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. this technique for the identification of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins using mudpit mass spectrometry is an approach that can be applied to the analysis of ubiquitinated proteins bound to other ubiquitin ligase complexes. using this technique, our list of mudpit-identified cul3-binding proteins also includes glur- <dig>  mei <dig> and p60/katanin , which are known substrates of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex
 <cit> , further supporting the validity of this method for substrate identification.

cul <dig> mediated the ubiquitination of lysine residues on its substrates based on the proximity of its location rather than selecting residues based on specific sequences
in this analysis, we have identified the position of lysine residues on which ubiquitin molecules were conjugated to target proteins, as well as the minimum number of ubiquitination sites that are found on each potential substrate. as a heterogeneous population of both ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated lysine residues were observed in identical tryptic peptides of cul3-binding proteins , we believe that the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex exhibits some flexibility in the selection of its ubiquitin conjugation site. furthermore, a significant number of potential substrates also contain more than one ubiquitination site. additionally, lysine residues that are within  <dig> residues of each other are often ubiquitinated at both positions. these findings suggest that the mechanism of ubiquitination by the bcr complex is not based on a specific protein sequence adjacent to the ubiquitinated lysine residue, but may be approximated by the distance of the bound substrate from the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. this hypothesis is partly based on a study, which indicates that the initial selection for the ubiquitination site on protein substrates is determined by a tertiary complex of e2-e3-substrate
 <cit> .

model of the bcrlrr complexes
the scf model for cullin-based e <dig> ligase stated that the cullin provides a scaffold to assemble a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme , skp <dig> and an f-box containing protein. the f-box containing protein recognizes substrates and recruits them to the e <dig> complex . previous models of the bcr ubiquitin ligase complex proposed that a btb domain-containing protein serves the combined functions of both skp <dig> and the f-box protein by binding to cul <dig> via its btb domain and using its secondary protein-protein interacting domain to target its bound substrates for ubiquitination . this model is supported by the identification of substrates of the cul <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex and their adaptor proteins, such as nrf <dig> and keap <dig>  glur <dig> and actinfillin, dishevelled and klhl <dig>  aurora b and klhl11/klhl <dig> and p60/katanin and klhdc5
 <cit> . in this report, we have identified an additional group of cul3-binding proteins that contain either lrr domains or wd <dig> domains. incidentally, these some of these lrr domain-containing proteins also interact with the btb domain-containing proteins. we propose that the b/c-like box domain on the lrrs and a unique, proline rich domain on the btb domain containing protein ctb <dig> is responsible for the binding between the btb domain-containing protein, the lrrs and cul <dig>  this binding causes the btb domain-containing protein to become a substrate, possibly by changing how it binds to cul <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we have identified an additional group of cul3-binding proteins that contain either lrr domains or wd <dig> domains. we propose that the b/c-like box domain on the lrr domain-containing proteins and a unique, proline rich domain on the btb domain containing protein ctb <dig> is responsible for the binding between the btb domain-containing protein, the lrrs and cul <dig>  however, the binding interaction may be more complex because deletion of the btb domain resulted in enhanced lrr binding to cul <dig>  these observations led us to further investigate these interactions. we found that one of these lrr domain-containing proteins, lrr5/fmod, causes a btb domain-containing protein, fazf, to become a substrate for the bcr complex. possibly, this mechanism is a way for btb domain proteins to be removed from substrates. there are several know examples of cullin based e <dig> ligases degrading their substrate adaptors
 <cit> , thus we suggest that this may be a general theme for the function of these novel cul <dig> binding proteins. the selective specificity of lrr <dig> for fazf and not the highly homologous protein plzf is intriguing and may indicate specificity for lrr domain-containing proteins binding btb domain-containing proteins. additional biochemical analyses will lead to a more thorough understanding of this novel regulatory mechanism.
