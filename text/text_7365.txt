BACKGROUND
plant responses to many biotic and abiotic stresses are orchestrated locally and systemically by signaling molecules known as jasmonates , which are derived from linolenic acid via the octadecanoid pathway  <cit> . jasmonic acid  and other octadecanoids act as plant growth regulators in various developmental processes such as fruit ripening, pollen maturation, root growth and tendril coiling  <cit> . they are also potent modulators of defenses against insects and pathogens  <cit> . thus, the lipid-based octadecanoid pathway leading to ja has also been found to be an integral part of the signal transduction pathway. the 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases  are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of double-bonds adjacent to an oxo group in α, β-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones and are part of the octadecanoid pathway that converts linolenic acid to jasmonic acid  <cit> .

in plants, the opr genes, which belong to the old yellow enzyme  family, are flavin mononucleotide -dependent oxidoreductases and form multigene families. the first member of the opr family in higher plants was identified from arabidopsis thaliana, and named atopr <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, other opr genes were identified in the tomato  <cit> , pea  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  genomes. earlier studies on the enzymatic activity of oprs in arabidopsis and tomato revealed that these enzymes have distinct substrate preferences and therefore have been classified into two groups, group i and ii, depending on their substrate specificity  <cit> . opr group i enzymes preferentially catalyze the reduction of -12-oxo- <dig>  15-octadecatrienoic acid , while opr group ii enzymes preferentially catalyze -12-oxo- <dig>  15-octadecatrienoic acid , a natural biosynthetic intermediate precursor in ja biosynthesis. atopr <dig> and leopr <dig>  belonging to group ii, have been shown to efficiently reduce the natural isomer 9s,13s-opda to 3-oxo-2-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid , the precursor of ja  <cit> . in contrast, atopr1/ <dig> and leopr1/ <dig>  belonging to group i, were unable to catalyze this step  <cit> .

the biological significance of plants having multiple oprs is not clearly understood. to date, studies of the physiological role of oprs have focused mainly on their expression in dicots and monocots. among dicots, oprs have been characterized in arabidopsis and tomato. the expression levels of opr mrna and protein have also been analyzed in transgenic plants. oprs in arabidopsis have been shown to have tissue-specific expression patterns. atopr <dig> is transcribed more actively in flowers or anthers than in the roots and leaves  <cit> . conversely, atopr1/ <dig> is transcribed more actively in roots and leaves  <cit> . furthermore, the transcription of oprs can also be induced by wounds, pathogens, signaling molecules such as ja, methyl jasmonate , salicylic acid , abscisic acid  and ethylene, and other environmental stimuli  <cit> . for example, atopr1/ <dig> transcription is up-regulated transiently in response to wounding  <cit> ; likewise, the expression of β-glucuronidase  under the control of the atopr <dig> and atopr <dig> promoters was up-regulated after stimulation by touch, wounding, and ultraviolet  irradiation  <cit> . in addition, mutants for atopr <dig>  which encodes the enzymes belonging to group ii, were shown to be deficient in the biosynthesis of ja and the males were sterile  <cit> . moreover, the atopr <dig> mutants accumulated 12-oxo- <dig>  15-octadecatrienoic acid  following wounding and were resistant to fungal and insect attacks  <cit> .

in monocots, more than  <dig> opr genes have been found in the rice genome; osopr <dig> was the first opr gene characterized at the biochemical and molecular level  <cit> . this gene is rapidly and transiently up-regulated in response to a variety of environmental cues including ja, sa, ethylene and h2o <dig>  <cit> . similar results were found for the expression of osopr <dig>  <cit> . moreover, over-expression osopr <dig>  clustered in the same group ii, was able to compensate for the phenotype of atopr <dig> mutants, whereas osopr <dig>  which is clustered in other groups, was unable to compensate for the same phenotype  <cit> . in addition, an analysis of mrna transcripts indicated that maize opr genes exhibit organ-specific expression and can be rapidly and transiently up-regulated in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses that include wounding, signaling molecules  and the presence of pathogens  <cit> . in spite of ongoing studies, the function of oprs in plants remains obscure.

although biochemical and genetic studies in arabidopsis and other species have led to important discoveries in understanding the function of oprs, proven biological roles have been elucidated for only a few members of this family and in a limited number of species. additionally, differences in family size among eukaryotes raise several questions regarding the evolution and functional divergence of the opr gene family. thus, a comprehensive comparative genome study is essential for understanding the evolution and function of the opr gene family in plants. here, we performed a comparative genomic analysis using a comprehensive bioinformatics/phylogenetic approach to elucidate the evolutionary history, structural evolution and putative functional divergence of the opr gene family in plants. firstly, we identified all opr paralogues from eleven species , representing the six major plant lineages with available genome sequences. secondly, phylogenetic analysis was performed to trace back the evolutionary history of the opr family in plants. thirdly, exon/intron structure analysis was performed to gain insight into the possible mechanisms for structural evolution of the opr gene family, because the exon/intron structural divergence within gene families is also a mechanism for the evolution of multiple gene families. finally, functional divergence analysis suggests that changes in selective constraints and/or amino acid properties occurred after gene duplication, which led to subfamily-specific functional evolution after their diversification. this has also led us to predict the positive-selection sites or critical amino acid sites that may be of importance for the functional divergence of the opr paralogues.

RESULTS
identification of opr genes and their homologues in plants
using the tigr, tair, maizegdb, plantgdb, jgi and ncbi databases, we first retrieved the available opr or opr-like sequences from currently sequenced and unfinished genomes;  <dig> opr homologue genes were identified  from various green plants, including unicellular and multicellular green algae, mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms. to explore the origin and evolutionary history of the opr gene family, we characterized opr genes from eleven species representing the six major plant lineages: the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and volvox carteri, the moss physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii, the gymnosperm picea sitchensis, the monocotyledonous angiosperms oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor and zea mays and the dicotyledonous angiosperms arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa and medicago truncatula. a complete or draft genome sequence was used in all of our searches, except for the gymnosperm picea sitchensis, whose genome sequence is not yet available. after exclusion of unfinished and partial protein sequences, we finally obtained  <dig> opr genes from the above eleven representative plants . the results of pfam and smart analysis showed that the typical opr proteins possess only one oxidored_fmn  domain. three opr candidates  without complete oxidored_fmn domains were excluded from the following analysis.

phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the opr gene family in all plant lineages
to explore the phylogenetic relationship among opr paralogues in plants, a rooted maximum-likelihood  phylogenetic tree with  <dig> opr genes from  <dig> species  was inferred from the amino acid sequences of their oxidored_fmn domains , using the phyml v <dig>  program  <cit>  under the best-fit model wag+i+g. here, the best-fit model  for amino acid substitution was selected by prottest v <dig>   <cit>  with discrete gamma distribution in four categories. all parameters  were estimated from the dataset. to compensate for the disadvantages of phyml in tree-space searches, the ml tree was reconstructed using the phylip v <dig>  package  <cit>  under the gamma-corrected jones-taylor-thornton  model  <cit> . the ml trees constructed by phyml v <dig>  and phylip v <dig>  gave congruent topologies . additionally, tree topology assessed by neighbor joining , minimum evolution  and maximum parsimony  methods , was substantially similar to the ml tree . using scoye <dig> from yeast as the outgroup, the opr gene family can be subdivided into seven well-conserved subfamilies  with high statistical support, according to the topology and the deep duplication nodes of opr paralogues in the ml tree ; we numbered these subfamilies sub. i to sub. vii. all opr genes from the green algae were grouped into the same subfamily , while those from the land plants were grouped into several other subfamilies , showing that the opr family originated before the divergence of the green algae and the ancestor of land plants. of the other six subfamilies, only sub. ii was present in all land plants except for the gymnosperm picea sitchensis, revealing that all opr genes from land plants shared a common ancestor after the divergence from aquatic plants. sub. vi was only present in lower land plants, i.e. mosses and lycophytes, while sub. i, iii, iv and v were only present in higher land plants, i.e. gymnosperms and angiosperms. moreover, sub. iii, iv and v were found exclusively in monocots . these observations indicated that all opr genes from land plants shared a common ancestor before the divergence between lower and higher land plants; subsequently, lineage-specific expansion and divergence events occurred in higher land plants, especially in monocots, after divergence from lower land plants. in addition, opr genes from the same lineage, such as mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, tended to be clustered together .

additionally, the chromosomal location of the opr genes in the genomes of the monocots  and dicots  showed that opr genes are distributed in clusters . moreover, searching for such paralogues within the opr family of genes using the plant genome duplication database  revealed that only one paralogous gene pair  exists in sorghum bicolor , but not in other species. further analysis using the pgdd revealed cross-genome syntenic relationships in four gene pairs: osopr02-1/sbopr04- <dig>  osopr06-1/sbopr10- <dig>  osopr08-1/sbopr07- <dig> and ptopr5/atopr02- <dig> . these findings suggest that the ancestral opr of each subfamily in monocots and dicots underwent tandem duplication, which caused differences in the number of opr genes within each subfamily and species, while segmental duplication occurred only in the expansion of the opr family in sorghum bicolor.

interestingly, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct differences between aquatic and land plants, not only in the number of opr genes, but also in the number of subfamilies . therefore, based on the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis, we proposed a schematic pattern to account for the expansion and evolution of the opr gene family in plants . in this pattern, the opr genes were plant-specific and originated before the divergence of green algae from land plants. the ancestral opr gene evolved into the present sub. vii and the common ancestral opr of land plants evolved after the divergence of aquatic plants  from land plants. subsequently, the common ancestral opr of land plants underwent one duplication and yielded two copies: one copy evolved into the present sub. ii, while the other copy evolved into the present sub. vi in lower land plants  and sub. i in higher land plants  . the events leading to lineage-specific expansion, especially by tandem duplication, occurred in monocots after their divergence from dicots, and sub. iii, iv and v were generated exclusively in monocots .

structural evolution of the opr family genes
to examine the possible mechanisms of structural evolution of opr paralogues, we compared the exon/intron structures of individual opr genes in all plant lineages, except for gymnosperms . the exon/intron structures were obtained using the online gene structure display server  with either genbank accession numbers, or both coding sequences  and genomic sequences  <cit> . figure 1b provides a detailed illustration of the relative length of introns and conservation of the corresponding exon sequences within each of the opr paralogues in plants. notably, although the members of the opr gene family exhibited differences in intron number and intron length, the intron positions and intron phases were remarkably well-conserved, with conserved splicing sites between adjacent exons . as for the number of introns, the opr genes in sub. vii contained 6– <dig> introns while those in sub. iii all contained only one intron. most of the opr genes in the other five subfamilies, sub. i, ii, iv, v and vi, contained 3– <dig> introns . interestingly, the opr genes in the oldest subfamily, sub. vii, contained the greatest number of introns while those in the youngest subfamily, sub. iii, contained the fewest introns . these findings, together with the phylogenetic trees, indicate that a significant number of intron loss events occurred during the structural evolution of the opr gene family from green algae to angiosperms.

in addition, a total of  <dig> different introns have been found within all the genes of the opr family across different lineage species, according to intron position . further analysis the introns of opr paralogues in sub. vii indicated that i <dig> and i <dig> exist only in vcopr <dig> and cropr2/ <dig>  but not in cropr <dig> and vcopr <dig> . however, cropr <dig> and vcopr <dig> arose earlier than vcopr <dig> and cropr2/ <dig>  according to the topology of the ml tree . these observations suggest that i <dig> and i <dig> were most likely gained by the ancestor of vcopr <dig> and cropr2/ <dig> before the divergence between chlamydomonas reinhardtii and volvox carteri. the above-mentioned events of intron loss and i <dig> and i <dig> gain in opr paralogues are consistent with previous findings by lin et al.   <cit>  and roy and penny   <cit> .

the aforementioned exon/intron structure comparison and the phylogenetic analysis provide strong evidence that single intron loss events occurred during the structural evolution of opr paralogues from green algae to angiosperms. to further investigate the structural evolution of opr paralogues in different lineage species, we constructed an evolution model that could yield the current opr genes in plant species of different lineages . under the assumption that introns, which were located exactly at the same position and have been given the same phase, should be present in the common ancestor, we reconstructed the ancestral exon/intron structure of opr for all plant lineages . the results obtained from the analysis of introns of opr paralogues in sub. vii suggested that the events of intron gain may have occurred in algae and that i <dig> and i <dig> were most likely gained in vcopr <dig> and cropr2/3; therefore, the ancestral exon/intron structure of opr in algae should contain  <dig>  not  <dig> introns, and i <dig> & i <dig> were not included . in this model, the ancestor opr contained  <dig> or more introns, symmetrically distributed throughout the coding sequence of opr, and multiple unique introns were lost during the evolutionary process from green algae to angiosperms . for example, i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig> and i <dig> were lost in the evolution from aquatic plants  to lower land plants , while i <dig> was lost in the evolution from lower land plants to higher land plants . moreover, single intron losses also occurred during the expansion and divergence of the opr gene family in each plant lineage. for example, the ancestral opr in algae contained at least  <dig> introns, whereas all five opr genes contained only 6– <dig> introns . this suggests that a single intron loss occurred during the evolution of opr genes in algae. similar cases were also found in other lineages, i.e., mosses, lycophytes and angiosperms  . interestingly, i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig> and i <dig> were present in the opr gene of the common ancestor of all plant lineages , but some or all of them were lost during the evolution from the ancestral opr gene to the present individual opr genes in each plant lineage . this suggests that these four conserved introns  were retained during the evolution of different plant lineages from algae to angiosperms, but other introns were lost during the structural evolution of opr paralogues in each plant lineage. in addition to single intron losses, intron gain may have occurred during the structural evolution of opr paralogues; it appears to have occurred only in green algae .

additionally, the exon-intron structure of opr genes showed that the length of introns within each individual opr gene was distinct, with lengths varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . further analysis of the introns of oprs in arabidopsis and rice indicated that the average intron length of arabidopsis opr genes was  <dig> bp, close to that of the entire arabidopsis genome  calculated from arabidopsis genome tair  <dig>  release. the average intron length of rice opr genes was  <dig> bp, longer than that of the entire rice genome  calculated from the tigr rice genome release  <dig> . moreover, most of these introns are putative miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  or retrotransposons, which can be found in the tigr oryza repeat database. for example, short fragment insertions in the first intron  of osopr01- <dig> and the second intron  of osopr06- <dig> show high homology  with the mites, while a long fragment insertion in the intron  of osopr06- <dig> shows high homology  with the retrotransposons . similar cases were also found in maize and sorghum opr genes. these results suggest that the presence of indels within introns, caused by mites or retrotransposons, may have arisen during the structural evolution of the opr gene family.

variable selective pressures among amino acid sites under diversifying selection
to analyze positive or negative selection of specific amino acid regions within the full-length protein sequences of oprs, substitution rate ratios of nonsynonymous  versus synonymous  mutations  were calculated. the ka/ks ratio should be  <dig> for genes subject to neutral selection, <  <dig> for genes subject to negative selection and >  <dig> for genes subject to positive selection; however, there are constraints in using ka/ks to assess protein evolution for this gene family. because members of the gene family show few changes in protein sequences, especially for duplicated genes, they may have more similar ka and ks values than their parental genes, bringing the ka/ks ratio closer to  <dig> or to less than  <dig>  <cit> . amino acids in a protein sequence are expected to be under different selective pressure and to have different underlying dn/ds ratios. in order to test for positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site-specific models implemented using the codeml program of the paml v <dig>  package  <cit>  were tested. table  <dig> lists parameter estimates and log-likelihood values under models of variable ω ratios among sites. model m <dig>  assumes the same ratio for all sites and fits the data much worse than any of the other models, accounting for variable ω ratios across sites. for example, the m <dig>  model involves four more parameters than m <dig> , and the likelihood rate test  statistic 2Δℓ =  <dig>  is much greater than the critical value  =  <dig>  with df =  <dig> . the results suggest that m <dig> was rejected when compared to m <dig>  and the existence of extreme variation in selective pressure among amino acid sites. moreover, the ratio value  in m <dig> was  <dig> , closer to  <dig> , suggesting that the opr family genes within each subfamily were under strong negative selection pressure and positive selection may have acted in very short regions or on only a few sites during the evolutionary process from algae to angiosperms.

* the amino acid residues depicted with an asterisk were also found to be implicated in the functional divergence between opr paralogues .

all three models that allow for the presence of positive-selection sites, i.e., m2a , m <dig>  and m <dig> , do suggest the presence of such sites . allowing for the presence of positive-selection sites  significantly improves the fit of the models. the comparison of models m1a and m2a should be stated as a test of the null hypothesis that all genes evolved under neutral conditions, versus the alternate hypothesis that some sites are under negative selection , some sites under neutral constraints  and some sites under positive selection . the neutral model  does not allow for sites with ω >  <dig>  while the positive selection model  adds an additional site class, with the ω ratio estimated to be  <dig> . the log-likelihood improvement was huge, as 2Δℓ =  <dig>  should be compared with  =  <dig>  with df =  <dig> . comparison between m <dig>  and m <dig>  produced similar results . this could be explained by the fact that the majority of the protein was subjected to constant negative selection while a few sites underwent positive selection  <cit> .

additionally, posterior probabilities for site classes were calculated under three models that allow for selection to be tested , and the results  were similar. for example, the probabilities that site  <dig> belongs to the class of positive-selection sites  were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  under the three models, respectively. table  <dig> lists sites inferred to be under positive selection under different models at the 95% confidence level. under models m2a, m <dig> and m <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sites were detected, respectively, and the majority of positive-selection sites were conserved with all three models. the detailed distribution of positive-selection sites predicted by model m <dig> is showed in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> sites were scattered over the  <dig> sssus  of the oxidored_fmn domain, except for four sites  at the n-terminus . further analysis indicated that  <dig> out of  <dig> sites were distributed in α-helices α1-α <dig>  whereas only  <dig> sites were distributed in β-strands, β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> . moreover, nearly 60% of the positive-selection sites  in α-helices were clustered in α <dig> , α <dig>  and α <dig>  . interestingly, all of the positive-selection sites in α-helices were clustered on the outside of the opr protein and near the  <dig> inner β-strands . in addition,  <dig> of the positive-selection sites were also detected in the substrate binding loop  , which was clustered at the top of the opr protein and formed the ceiling of the substrate-binding pocket . these observations provide evidence that positive-selection sites on α-helices, especially the α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> helices, together with the sbl, contributed to darwinian selection and evolution in the opr gene family.

analysis of functional divergence
we further investigated whether amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved oxidored_fmn domain could have caused adaptive functional diversification. two types of functional divergence  between gene clusters of the opr family were estimated by posterior analysis using the diverge v <dig>  program  <cit> , which evaluates the shifted evolutionary rate and altered amino acid properties after gene duplication  <cit> . in this analysis, the  <dig> opr proteins, except for atopr01-2/ <dig> and sbopr06- <dig> , were used and the estimation was based on the multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the oxidored_fmn domain  for any two opr subfamilies. pairwise comparisons of paralogous oprs from subfamilies i to vii were carried out and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence position was estimated. our results, as shown in table  <dig>  indicated that with three exceptions , the coefficients of type-i functional divergence  between opr subfamilies were statistically significant , with θi values varying from  <dig>  to  <dig> . these observations indicate that there were significantly site-specific altered selective constraints on most members of the opr family, leading to subfamily-specific functional evolution after diversification. nonetheless, in contrast to the findings on type-i functional divergence, there was no evidence of type-ii functional divergence among opr subfamilies, suggesting that the relative importance of type-i and type-ii functional divergence might be associated with specific functional classes of the protein family  <cit> .

* the amino acid residues depicted with an asterisk were also found to be predicted in positive-selection sites between opr paralogues .

moreover, some critical amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence were predicted based on site-specific profiles in combination with suitable cut-off values derived from the posterior probability of each comparison. in order to reduce false positives, qk >  <dig>   was used as the cutoff to identify type-i functional divergence-related residues in all comparisons between the seven opr subfamilies; the results are shown in table  <dig>  these results show distinct differences in the number and distribution of predicted sites for functional divergence within each pair . for example,  <dig> critical amino acid sites were predicted for the subfamilyi/vi pair and distributed in sssu   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while  <dig> critical amino acids sites were predicted for the subfamilyi/vii pair and distributed in sssu  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . further analysis revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> sites in pair i/vi and  <dig> out of  <dig> sites in pair i/vii were distributed in α helices and only one site  was located in β <dig> in the subfamily i/vii pair . similar cases were found in other subgroup pairs . in addition,  <dig> out of  <dig> positively selected sites detected under model m <dig>  implemented in the codeml program of the paml v <dig>  package were also found to be functionally divergent between opr paralogues . the shifted evolutionary rate at specific amino acid sites throughout the oxidored_fmn domain within each pair facilitated the functional divergence of opr subfamilies during the long period of evolution.

discussion
origin and evolution of the opr gene family
the opr gene family is present in all plant species and generally has multiple genes in each species. in this study, we comprehensively analyzed the phylogeny and evolution of the opr gene family in all plant lineages, and the results showed that seven well-conserved opr subfamilies exist in plants . all five opr genes identified from green algae fell into a separate clade  while all opr genes from land plants were clustered into sub. i–vi , suggesting that the opr gene might have originated before the divergence of green algae and the ancestor of land plants. moreover, the intron positions and the phases of adjacent exons in the oxidored_fmn domain were conserved in the opr genes in land plants , suggesting that all land plant opr genes might have originated from a common ancestor. additionally, phylogenetic analysis suggested that lineage-specific expansion events occurred after the divergence between lower and higher land plants, leading to the generation of sub. vi in lower land plants and sub. i in higher land plants . similarly, lineage-specific expansion events also occurred in higher land plants , and sub. iii, iv and v were generated after the divergence from dicots .

gene duplication, including tandem duplication, segmental duplication and genome duplication, continues to be a pervasive process and contributes to biological novelty in evolution  <cit> . in this paper, the clustering distribution of opr genes  revealed that tandem duplication had an additional role in determining the current size of the opr gene family. moreover, the search for paralogues indicated that the sbopr04-1/sbopr06- <dig> pair was generated by segmental duplication ; the age estimation of osopr genes  indicates that the divergence time within opr gene pairs was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million years ago , falling into the period of large-scale duplication events 30– <dig> mya  <cit> . these observations suggest that large-scale duplication may also have been involved in the expansion of the opr gene family in sorghum and rice.

the above analysis reveals that the opr gene family originated from a common ancestor of green plants, followed by lineage-specific expansion and divergence in each lineage and species during their evolution. moreover, lineage-specific expansion, especially by tandem duplication, is likely to have contributed to the size of the opr family and yielded multiple opr subfamilies in land plants, especially in higher land plants such as monocots. additionally, large-scale or segmental duplication may have been involved in the expansion of the opr gene family in sorghum and rice.

successive intron loss for structural evolution
gene duplication is a common phenomenon in plant genomes and continues to be a pervasive force in genome evolution  <cit> . to date, several models for the evolution of genomes have been proposed based on comparative genome studies of model organisms  <cit> , but little attention has been focused on the structural evolution of duplicated gene families. in fact, the structural diversity of gene family members is also a mechanism for the evolution of multiple gene families, and intron loss or gain can be an important step in generating structural diversity and complexity  <cit> . in this study, we analyzed the structural diversity of opr genes  and found that single intron loss events occurred during the expansion and structural evolution of opr paralogues. we found that most opr family genes lost two or more introns, and the number and position of intron loss was distinctly different among opr genes . furthermore, the intron loss events occurred not only in different plant lineages from algae to angiosperms , but also in each individual plant lineage, from the ancestral opr of each individual plant lineage to the present individual opr genes . these results, in combination with the phylogenetic trees of the opr gene family , suggest that intron losses occurred successively rather than simultaneously. in addition to intron loss, intron gain may have occurred during the structural evolution of opr paralogues in green algae .

intron positions have been shown to be remarkably well-conserved over long evolutionary time intervals  <cit> , and mounting evidence suggests that lineage-specific intron loss may occur during the evolution of a gene family  <cit> . in this paper, we observed that the intron positions and intron phases of the opr family genes were well-conserved , and some introns  were conserved in all plant lineages . this suggests that lineage-specific intron loss events might have occurred during the expansion and structural evolution of opr genes and generated diversity of gene structure.

the most commonly used model for intron loss is mrna-mediated intron loss  <cit> , but there are also other possibilities such as simple genomic deletion  <cit>  and in-frame intron deletion  <cit> . recent studies  <cit>  have indicated that introns closer to the 3' end of genes are preferentially lost, leaving the flanking exons to fuse and form a large exon at the 3' end. in this study, the results of exon-intron structure analysis  revealed that the introns of opr genes in aquatic plants  were distributed relatively symmetrically among the coding sequences, while the introns of opr genes in land plants were distributed asymmetrically, clustered at the 5' ends with the largest exon at the 3' end . moreover, introns i <dig> to i <dig> , located on the 3' end, were lost in land plants after the divergence from aquatic plants . these findings suggest that multiple unique introns, i.e., i <dig> -i <dig>  were lost during the evolution from aquatic plants to land plants and that mrna-mediated intron loss was responsible for their deletion. in contrast, the presence of indels within introns would predict that other mechanisms for intron loss  were involved.

functional divergence in the opr gene family
functional innovations including pseudogene formation  <cit> , subfunctionalization  <cit> , neofunctionalization  <cit>  and subneofunctionalization  <cit>  after gene duplication may result in altered functional constraints between the gene clusters of a gene family. in this study, the differences between exon/intron structures and the divergences in amino acid sequences among different subfamilies provided us with some hints that the opr paralogues may have a variety of physiological functions. the results of the functional divergence analysis  suggested that opr genes should be significantly functionally divergent from each other, owing to the evolutionary rate differences at some amino acid sites. a reasonable explanation for these differences would be that due to amino acid mutations, the opr family genes evolved some new subgroup-specific functions after divergence. hence, functional divergence might reflect the existence of long-term selective pressure. previous studies regarding the enzymatic activity of opr in arabidopsis and tomato showed that opr enzymes could be classified into two groups  based on their substrate specificity, which was determined by the substrate binding loop   <cit> . site-specific profile analysis of opr members showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> positive-selection sites found under model m <dig>  were functionally divergent and only  <dig> out of  <dig> critical amino acid sites  were located in the sbl . moreover, the majority of positive-selection sites or critical amino acid sites were distributed in α-helices, especially in α <dig>  α <dig> and α <dig> . these observations suggest that positive-selection pressure on the sbl, as well as α-helices, accelerated the functional divergence and formed multiple subfamilies in plants. additionally, few positive-selection sites were distributed in β-strands , suggesting that the function of the  <dig> β-strands, clustered inside of the opr protein, might be to define the conserved fold common to all oprs and maintain the proteins' structural and/or conformational stability.

studies on atoprs showed the atopr01- <dig> and atopr01- <dig>  which belong to subfamily i, preferentially catalyze 9r,13r-opda and are predominantly expressed in roots  <cit> , whereas atopr02- <dig>  which belongs to subfamily ii, catalyzes the reduction of 9s,13s-opda to form opc 8: <dig> and is expressed in flowers and anthers  <cit> . studies of atopr <dig> have shown that opr <dig> plants are deficient in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid and male-sterile, whereas opr <dig> and opr <dig> plants are normal  <cit> . these studies, together with the results of the phylogenetic analysis of opr paralogues in plants, suggest that osopr08- <dig>  zmopr01- <dig> and zmopr04- <dig>  which belong to subfamily ii, are probable candidates for involvement in the ja biosynthesis pathway, while osopr04- <dig> and zmopr02- <dig>  which belong to subfamily i, are likely part of a defense signaling pathway.

additionally, the expression of osopr06- <dig> , a member of subfamily iii, in the leaves of two week-old seedlings is induced not only by hormones  and environmental stress factors such as drought, salt, chilling, uv and o <dig>  but also by protein phosphatase inhibitors such as cantharidin , endothall  and okadaic acid   <cit> , while its expression in suspension-cultured rice cells is induced by ja and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide   <cit> . the results of our phylogenetic analysis of the opr gene family, together with the previous studies, suggest that subfamily iii, existing exclusively in monocots, may have an important role in defense signaling pathways and the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway. the other two subfamilies  may represent pseudogene, subfunctionalization, or neofunctionalization families of genes. further experiments need to be performed to elucidate the function of these genes in monocots.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides a comparative genomic analysis addressing the phylogenetic relationships and evolution of the opr gene family in eleven species representing six major lineages within the green plants. the results of the phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven well-conserved subfamilies exist in plants and that all opr paralogues originated from a common ancestor of green plants. lineage-specific expansion, primarily through tandem duplication, contributed to the size of the opr gene family, and multiple subfamilies formed in land plants after divergence from aquatic plants. the exon/intron structure analysis showed that the gene structures were diverse, while the intron positions and intron phases were highly conserved across different lineages. these observations together with the results obtained from the phylogenetic analysis indicate that successive single intron losses, as well as indels within introns, were involved in the structural evolution of opr paralogues. finally, the functional divergence analysis between opr paralogues suggested that significantly site-specific altered selective constraints acted on most opr paralogues after gene duplication, leading to subgroup-specific functional evolution after their phylogenetic diversification. this study also demonstrates that amino acids critical for functional divergence are located in the regions including the substrate binding loop , as well as in α-helices , indicating the importance of these regions in opr proteins. these data may provide valuable information for future studies of the function of this gene family, especially subfamilies iii, iv and v in monocots.
