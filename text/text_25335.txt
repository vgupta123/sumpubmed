BACKGROUND
felid herpesvirus- <dig>  is an enveloped dsdna virus classified under the genus varicellovirus within the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae <cit> . in susceptible cats, fehv- <dig> accounts for approximately 50-75% of upper respiratory infections
 <cit> . following exposure of the conjunctival and oronasal mucous membranes, fehv- <dig> replicates extensively at these sites, resulting in pyrexia, depression, anorexia, sneezing, conjunctivitis, keratitis, and oculonasal discharge
 <cit> . the acute phase of fehv- <dig> infection is followed by lifelong latency
 <cit> . latency is defined as an asymptomatic period during which infectious virus cannot be recovered from tissues, but can be induced to reactivate through organ culture or explantation
 <cit> . reactivation of a previously latent infection occurs readily in response to natural stressors or administration of corticosteroids
 <cit> . reactivation is associated with renewed virus production, shedding of infectious virus, and ocular or nasal lesions
 <cit> .

in a murine herpes simplex virus  <dig>  model, the spread of hsv- <dig> from initial corneal epithelial replication sites to intra-ocular structures and the nervous system has been well documented
 <cit> . after topical inoculation of scarified corneas of adult mice, viral antigen has been detected using immunohistochemistry by day  <dig> in the cornea, conjunctiva, iris, choroid, retina, ciliary ganglia , trigeminal ganglia , pterygopalatine ganglia , superior cervical ganglia, brainstem, olfactory bulb, and hypothalamus
 <cit> . hsv- <dig> infection has also been documented in human cg
 <cit> . latent varicella zoster virus  has been demonstrated in cranial nerve ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic nervous system ganglia of human cadavers using polymerase chain reaction  and in situ hybridization
 <cit> . the vzv has also been isolated from corneas of humans with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and chronic keratitis
 <cit> . previous reports have shown that fehv- <dig> can be isolated during the acute phase of the disease from the cornea, conjunctiva, nasal epithelium, nasal turbinates, tonsils, and tg
 <cit> . the presence of viral dna during latency has been demonstrated by pcr in the cornea, nasal turbinates, olfactory bulbs, cerebrum, optic nerve, optic chiasm, and tg
 <cit> . latency associated transcripts , small strands of rna transcribed by the virus within latently infected neurons
 <cit> , have been shown to be present within latently infected tg
 <cit> .

the tg or other neural tissues of fehv- <dig> infected animals have not been examined histologically to document the lesions caused by fehv- <dig> infection. in the tg of mice acutely infected with hsv- <dig>  the virus has been detected within both neural and non-neural cells
 <cit> . infection with hsv- <dig> also induced apoptosis of neurons and a histiocytic and lymphocytic infiltrate
 <cit> . the tg of mice latently infected with hsv- <dig> typically demonstrated a mononuclear cellular infiltrate that has also been documented in the tg of latently infected humans
 <cit> . this cellular infiltrate is believed to play a critical role in the prevention of recrudescence
 <cit> .

in this study we defined the ocular and neural tissues with detectable virus during active and latent fehv- <dig> infection and quantified the amount of virus present within the cornea, conjunctiva, tg, cg, ptpg, cranial cervical ganglia , uvea, retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, visual cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and olfactory bulb. the study population consisted of  <dig> groups each composed of  <dig> inoculated cats and  <dig> control cat. samples were collected from group  <dig> on day  <dig> post inoculation  when all fehv- <dig> exposed cats were exhibiting ocular signs, from group  <dig> on day  <dig> pi which was the peak of ocular and respiratory signs, and from group  <dig> on day  <dig> pi when the clinical signs had resolved and latency was established. the tg and cg were examined histologically to detect lesions associated with both active and latent infection. correlations between the severity of clinical signs and the viral load within the tg were made from samples collected on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> post-inoculation.

RESULTS
clinical scores and serologic evaluation
all inoculated cats developed clinical signs such as sneezing, ocular discharge, nasal discharge, anorexia, and elevated body temperature that were consistent with fehv- <dig> infection, whereas all control cats remained disease-free. the median total of the clinical scores from day  <dig> to the day of euthanasia was  <dig>  for group  <dig> ,  <dig>  for group  <dig> , and  <dig>   for group  <dig> . in group  <dig> all clinical signs had resolved prior to euthanasia. the control cats did not develop fehv- <dig> specific virus neutralizing  antibodies. the group  <dig> inoculated cats seroconverted as the fehv- <dig> vn antibody titers were less than 1: <dig> at days  <dig> and  <dig> pi and increased to 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> at days  <dig> and  <dig> pi.

virus isolation 
the vi data are presented in table 
 <dig>  fehv- <dig> was not isolated from any of the samples taken from the control cats. except for the cranial cervical ganglion, virus was isolated from each of the tissue types collected from group  <dig> , group  <dig> , or both. except for a single corneal sample from a cat in group  <dig> , virus was not isolated from any tissue sample collected from group  <dig> .

virus isolation results obtained for each tissue type on each day. all control samples were negative and are not listed within this table. ptpg pterygopalatine ganglia. ccg cranial cervical ganglia.

rt-pcr
the pcr results for each individual tissue type and the fehv- <dig> dna copy numbers reported per  <dig> cells of the homogenized tissues examined are shown in table 
 <dig> and figure 
 <dig>  as the number of fehv- <dig> genomes/μg of sample dna was known, the fehv- <dig> copy number per  <dig> cells was calculated based on  <dig>  haploid genome equivalents/μg of feline cellular dna
 <cit> . individual cell types were not examined. the fehv- <dig> copy number per  <dig> cells was reported to standardize comparisons between the various tissues as different tissues yielded different amounts of dna. fehv- <dig> dna was not detected by real-time pcr in any of the samples obtained from the control cats. for each group, the total of the clinical scores from day  <dig> to the day of euthanasia and the fehv- <dig> dna copy number per  <dig> cells in the tg were compared by linear regression . the total clinical score and fehv- <dig> copy number were strongly correlated  for group  <dig>  the clinical score and fehv- <dig> copy number were not correlated for groups  <dig>  or  <dig> .

real-time pcr assay  results obtained for each tissue type on each day. all control samples were negative and are not listed within this table. tg trigeminal ganglia. cg ciliary ganglia. ptpg pterygopalatine ganglia. ccg cranial cervical ganglia. op chiasm optic chiasm. vis cortex visual cortex. olf bulb olfactory bulb.

histopathology
the corneas, conjunctiva, tg, and cg were examined histologically. no histological changes were found within the cornea, conjunctiva, tg, or cg of control animals. no histologic changes were noted within any of the corneal samples except for one cat from group  <dig>  in that sample multiple, solitary, degenerate epithelial cells and a mild lymphocytic infiltrate were noted. histologic changes consisting of epithelial cell attenuation and/or loss and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation were seen in the conjunctival samples from all  <dig> inoculated cats. the changes were milder in the group  <dig> cats. all 4/ <dig> tg obtained from group  <dig> and 3/ <dig> obtained from group  <dig> had histologic changes consisting of ganglion cell death, depletion of ganglionic cells, increased numbers of glial cells, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation . one/four tg obtained from group  <dig> showed ganglion cell depletion, but no concurrent inflammation. histologic changes were not evident in the examined cg of inoculated cats. however in  <dig> cats the small size of the cg precluded obtaining an appropriate section for histologic evaluation.

discussion
fehv- <dig> infection in cats is a valid natural host model to study herpesvirus-induced ocular disease and latency in humans. in this study we describe intra-ocular and neural fehv- <dig> involvement during the acute phase of the infection of tissues  from which fehv- <dig> has not previously been isolated
 <cit> . during the latent phase of infection, latent viral dna was detected not only within the tg, but also the ccg of all cats and in ptpg of two of the inoculated cats. morphologically ganglionic cell death and inflammation were present within the tg during the acute phase of infection.

to our knowledge, involvement of the uveal tract during the acute phase of fehv- <dig> infection has not previously been documented. felid herpesvirus- <dig> dna has been detected by pcr in the aqueous humor of cats with idiopathic uveitis and in clinically normal cats
 <cit> . however, in previous studies only the uveal tract of latently infected cats has been examined and virus was not detected
 <cit> . the isolation of fehv- <dig> from the uveal tract demonstrates that cats, like mice infected with hsv-1
 <cit> , experience active intra-ocular virus replication.

another not previously reported finding was the isolation of fehv- <dig> from all retinas during the acute phase of the disease. as retinal homogenates were used in the current study, we were unable to determine the specific layer of the retina involved during the acute phase of infection. in one murine model hsv- <dig> study, utilizing corneal scarification prior to inoculation, infectious virus was detected within the retinal photoreceptors
 <cit> . noteworthy also is that after intracameral administration of hsv- <dig> in a murine hsv- <dig> model, the virus is detected within the contralateral, but not the ipsilateral retina
 <cit> . in the present study, fehv- <dig> reached the retina without intracameral injection or corneal scarification. no visual deficits were noted. however fundic examinations were not performed as part of this study and therefore retinal abnormalities might not have been detected. in addition, histologic examination was not performed on any of the intra-ocular tissues. therefore while fehv- <dig> was detected within multiple ocular tissues, the morphological changes due to the presence of the virus were not evaluated.

in the murine hsv- <dig> model an intense inflammatory response is noted histologically in response to the intra-ocular infection
 <cit> . in contrast, the cats in this study showed no clinical signs of intraocular inflammation despite the presence of relatively large amounts of replicating virus. perhaps the magnitude of the infection  explains the lack of intra-ocular inflammation noted in this study. the amount of fehv- <dig> present within the intra-ocular tissues is much less than the 2× <dig> plaque forming units used to inoculate the anterior chamber in the murine model
 <cit> . ocular examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope would be required in future studies to detect subtle inflammation. future studies combining histologic examination and in situ hybridization will further clarify this difference.

virus particles and fehv- <dig> dna were detected during this study within the optic nerve and optic chiasm. since these tissues lack neuronal cell bodies
 <cit>  the virus must either have been undergoing axonal transport
 <cit> , have infected glial cells within the optic nerve and chiasm
 <cit> , or have been present within leukocytes within the neural tissues
 <cit> . reubel et al.
 <cit>  and weigler et al.
 <cit>  have previously detected latent fehv- <dig> dna within the optic nerves and chiasms using pcr assays. in this study latent viral dna was not detected within optic chiasm homogenates. viral fehv- <dig> dna, but not infectious virus, was present in the optic nerve of one cat. however in this cat virus was isolated from the cornea making it difficult to conclude that the dna present in the optic nerve was latent.

fehv- <dig> was also detected within the ciliary, pterygopalatine, and cranial cervical autonomic ganglia examined in this study. involvement of the autonomic ganglia has not previously been associated with fehv- <dig> infection. in this study fehv- <dig> established latent infections within the ccg of all cats. the consistent presence of latent fehv- <dig> within the ccg is similar to the behavior of varicella zoster virus , also a member of the varicellovirus genus, which is consistently found not only in cranial nerve ganglia
 <cit> , but also in autonomic systemic ganglia
 <cit> . in contrast, hsv- <dig> latency in humans is restricted to cranial nerve ganglia
 <cit> . infection of the autonomic ganglia provides extensive neural connection from the nasal passages and oropharynx to the ocular surface and intra-ocular structures
 <cit> . these neural pathways have been well described by labetoulle
 <cit> . latency within the autonomic ganglia as well as the tg may results in herpetic ocular disease which could involve not only the cornea, but also the uveal tract and retina
 <cit> .

histologically the cg examined all appeared normal. therefore either inflammatory changes do not occur in the cg or they were very focal and missed on histological sectioning. in contrast, all of the tg collected at days  <dig> and  <dig> pi showed ganglionic cell death, depletion of ganglion cells, increased numbers of glial cells, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. in human patients with hsv- <dig> infection histologic examination of the ganglia has not been performed during active infection due to the obvious difficulty in obtaining tissue samples
 <cit> . however in the murine model of hsv- <dig> infection, apoptosis of neurons and histiocytic and lymphocytic infiltrates have been noted
 <cit> . in humans infected with vzv, neuritis and degeneration of sensory nerve roots have been noted
 <cit> . in this study, only one section of tg from group  <dig> showed histologic changes: a loss of ganglion cells, but no concurrent inflammation. this was an unexpected finding as mice latently infected with hsv- <dig> typically demonstrate a mononuclear cellular infiltrate
 <cit> . in human tg, latent hsv- <dig> infection has also been associated with chronic inflammation. a lymphocytic infiltrate has also been noted in bovine tg latently infected with bovine herpesvirus − <dig> 
 <cit> . interestingly in one study, lymphocytes consistently surrounded latently infected hsv- <dig> human tg neurons, but not the vzv-positive neurons
 <cit> . latent fehv- <dig> infection may be more similar to latent vzv in this aspect.

in the current study, the fehv- <dig> copy numbers in the tg were much higher than those previously reported
 <cit> . this may be due to the fact that the time frame of this study was 30 days versus 56 days in the previous study. this may also be due to differences in the virulence of the viral strains used in each study, c- <dig> versus sge
 <cit> . the strain of hsv- <dig> has been shown to influence the number of latent virus particles within individual neurons in a murine model
 <cit> . the amount of virus inoculated was higher in the previous study of fehv-1
 <cit>  than this study and therefore was unlikely to play a role in the increased copy numbers within the tg. based on studies of hsv- <dig>  latency is typically established in only a small percentage of sensory neurons in humans
 <cit>  and the copy number is usually only 2– <dig> copies/cell
 <cit> . the copy numbers are reportedly similar for vzv
 <cit> . interestingly in our study wide variation was seen in the amount of latent fehv- <dig> dna detected despite all individuals receiving the same initial inoculum. in one study of a rabbit model of hsv- <dig>  the number of viral genomes was directly proportional to the titer of infectious inoculum
 <cit> . however in a different rabbit model and also murine model, this did not hold true
 <cit> . in the study reported here the latent viral load was strongly associated with the severity of clinical signs as denoted by the total clinical score from day  <dig> to the day of euthanasia. for mice infected with hsv- <dig>  a higher latency load is associated with an increased risk of recurrence
 <cit> . in human patients with hsv- <dig> and hsv- <dig> infection, the severity of the first episode and the latency load are strongly linked to the recurrence rate
 <cit> . this data would imply that animals with more severe clinical signs were at higher risk for recrudescence.

CONCLUSIONS
the intra-ocular and neural involvement during fehv- <dig> infection was more widespread than previously known. autonomic ganglia as well as sensory ganglia harbored latent fehv- <dig>  the histologic response in neural tissue was similar to that seen during hsv- <dig> or vzv infection. finally increased severity of clinical signs was associated with increased latent viral loads, likely increasing the risk of recrudescent infection.
