BACKGROUND
alpha tubulin, a highly conserved protein along the eukaryotic evolutionary tree, interacts with β-tubulin conforming an α/β-tubulin heterodimer that comprises the structural subunit of microtubules, the basic building structure of the cytoskeleton, which is responsible for cell shape and is involved in many essential processes, including cell division, ciliary and flagellar motility and intracellular transport  <cit> . in unicellular microorganisms the cell shape and form are particularly relevant and depend on morphogenetic processes affecting essentially to the internal cytoskeleton. on the other hand, these microorganisms, and particularly the trypanosomatid flagellates, are very adequate models for studying the morphogenetic processes mediated by cytoskeleton reorganizations  <cit> , as many aspects of their biology  depend on these processes.

the leishmania genus comprises at least  <dig> leishmania species that infect humans, and the spectrum of diseases that they cause can be categorized broadly into three types: self-healing cutaneous leishmaniasis , mucocutaneous leishmaniasis , and the often fatal visceral leishmaniasis   <cit> . endemic leishmaniasis transmissions have been reported in  <dig> countries on  <dig> continents, and around two million new cases of leishmaniasis occur each year  <cit> . there are two major developmental forms in leishmania, the motile promastigote and the amotile amastigote. classical studies demonstrated that the promastigote stage synthesizes more tubulin protein than the amastigote stage, and that this biosynthetic change of tubulin was found to correlate with the morphological change of microtubules in leishmanial flagella and cytoskeleton during promastigote-to-amastigote transformation  <cit> . studies aimed to uncover the regulation responsible for the differential expression of tubulin genes were initiated shortly after  <cit> , but this has resulted to be a difficult task due to the complex genome organization of tubulin genes  <cit> , in particular, and to the non-conventional mechanisms of gene regulation operating in leishmania <cit> .

in various leishmania species, the genomic organization of α- and β-tubulin genes has been analyzed, showing the existence of multiple copies, both arranged in tandem  and dispersed in the genome  <cit> . the availability of the genome sequences for several leishmania species  <cit>  has allowed resolving questions regarding the genome organization of complex gene families. in a recent work, jackson and co-workers have carried out a comprehensive study about genomic organization of β-tubulin genes in several leishmania species; these authors suggest that the gene organization has evolved to satisfy a need for innovative expression for β-tubulin genes  <cit> .

in this work, we studied the organization of α-tubulin genes in leishmania braziliensis based on the available, yet incomplete, genome sequence. a comparison with the organization of this gene in l. infantum and l. major is also provided. the 5´ and 3´ untranslated regions  for the different α-tubulin genes in l. braziliensis have been determined as well as their mrna expression levels under different conditions.

RESULTS
genomic organization of α-tubulin genes in l. braziliensis, l. infantum and l. major
in the genome of leishmania major , the first leishmania genome that was sequenced  <cit> , a sole α-tubulin locus exists. according to the data available at the genedb database  <cit> , the locus is located at chromosome  <dig> and contains twelve copies  having identical orfs both in sequence and length , arranged in a head-to-tail tandem organization . a similar arrangement, containing two copies  separated by a sequence gap, and located also at chromosome  <dig>  was found in the genedb database for leishmania mexicana  genome. in contrast, according to the genome database , the leishmania infantum  genome contains two α-tubulin loci, both located at chromosome  <dig> and separated by a region of  <dig>  kb. the more 5´ locus  contains only a gene copy , whereas the other locus  has a complete copy  and a truncated one . the genome of leishmania  braziliensis   <cit> , causative agent of cl and mcl in the new world  <cit> , also contains two loci, one located at chromosome  <dig> and the other at chromosome  <dig>  the locus at chromosome  <dig>  is composed by two complete copies  and an α-tubulin-like gene . the locus at chromosome  <dig>  contains a sole copy consisting of a truncated form of the α-tubulin gene .

comparison of the genomic region around the α-tubulin loci in l. major, l. infantum and l. braziliensis revealed that the chromosomal regions surrounding the α-tubulin genes at chromosome  <dig> have experienced remarkable reorganizations in these three leishmania species, and the α-tubulin locus itself appears as the target of dna deletion and inversion events . thus, between l. major and l. infantum an inversion including the lmjf. <dig>  gene , the α-tubulin locus  and the lmjf. <dig>  to lmjf. <dig>  genes  took place. as a result of this event, the orf polarity of the linj. <dig>  to linj. <dig> , α-tubulin  and linj. <dig>  genes was changed with respect to the equivalent genes of l. major. in l. braziliensis, regarding the l. major chromosomal organization, a region spanning from the lmjf. <dig> to the lmjf. <dig> gene, corresponding to a string of  <dig> genes encoding for  <dig> hypothetical proteins and one putative class  <dig> lipase , was deleted. these deleted genes are present at chromosome  <dig>  in the l. braziliensis genome; this reorganization that seems the result of two transposition events dragged a region of the α-tubulin locus, generating the lbrm. <dig>  gene , which contains a truncated sequence of the prototypical α-tubulin gene .

the other α-tubulin locus at l. infantum chromosome  <dig>  comprising as mentioned above a partial and a complete copy of α-tubulin coding sequence , is found in a region that also has experienced clear reorganizations in these three leishmania species. thus, the regions flanking the α-tubulin genes linj. <dig>  and linj. <dig>  in l. infantum chromosome have experienced a substantial reorganization regarding the equivalent chromosomal region in l. major, and again the α-tubulin locus  appeared as the center of the reorganization events . another minor transposition event, regarding the linj. <dig>  gene  took place after separation of these two leishmania species. this chromosomal region in l. braziliensis  is very similar to the l. major homologous region , excepting an insertion comprising the lbrm. <dig>  to lbrm. <dig>  gene block . the lbrm. <dig> -lbrm. <dig>  orthologous are located on chromosome  <dig> in both l. major and l. infantum .

in summary, these analyses pointed out that the α-tubulin gene loci have been reorganized in a drastic manner along leishmania speciation. however, this fact contrasts with the chromosomal organization of the three β-tubulin loci that is largely syntenic in l. major, l. infantum and l. braziliensis <cit> .

nevertheless, it cannot be excluded the possibility that differences in the chromosomal distribution and organization of α-tubulin genes among l. major, l. infantum and l. braziliensis are the result of artifacts generated during assembling of contigs into chromosomal scaffolds. the l. infantum and l. braziliensis genome sequences were produced by whole-genome shotgun sequencing to five- and six-fold coverage, respectively  <cit> . the resulting assemblies of l. infantum and l. braziliensis yielded  <dig> and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. finally, chromosomal scaffolds were produced by aligning contigs against the reference l. major sequence  <cit> . however, sequence gaps remain to be determined in the genome sequences for both l. infantum and l. braziliensis . remarkably, the α-tubulin locus at chromosome  <dig> in l. braziliensis  and one of the α-tubulin loci at chromosome  <dig> of l. infantum  are located at the end of contigs .

copy number determination in the l. braziliensis α-tubulin loci
as shown in figure  <dig>  the genomic regions containing the two α-tubulin loci in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of l. braziliensis has not been sequenced in full; there are sequence gaps that do not permit deducing the number of genes present at each locus. moreover, tandem gene arrays are among the most challenging to resolve correctly using current genome sequencing technologies, since repetitive sequence reads tend to collapse into a single contig when no variation exists to distinguish them. previous studies in l. major <cit>  and l. enriettii <cit>  showed the existence of tandem arrangements of α-tubulin genes; in fact, the l. major genome database includes twelve gene copies tandemly arranged at chromosome  <dig>  in order to determine the number of genes and their organization in the two α-tubulin loci of l. braziliensis, southern blots containing dna digested with selected restriction enzymes were hybridized with a probe derived from the α-tubulin coding region . southern blot analysis of genomic dna, partially digested with the csp <dig> restriction enzyme, evidenced the typical ladder of tandemly repeated genes . at least  <dig> copies of the repeated unit  were observed. according to the restriction maps of the two α-tubulin loci , this tandem should be present in the locus at chromosome  <dig>  whereas the locus at chromosome  <dig> would contain a sole α-tubulin gene . recently, rogers et al.  <cit> , analyzing illumina high-throughput sequencing data, inferred that l. braziliensis genome should contain  <dig> α-tubulin copies . tandemly repetition of genes has been proposed as a direct mechanism for increasing the transcript abundance of highly expressed proteins  <cit> , and it is known that α-tubulin is an abundant protein in leishmania <cit> .

when l. braziliensis total dna was digested with restriction enzymes lacking cut sites within the α-tubulin loci , and the hybridization pattern was analyzed by southern blotting, a conspicuous result was obtained . the presence of three  and two  large bands was unexpected. an explanation to this finding may be either the existence of allelic sequence polymorphisms in the regions surrounding the α-tubulin locus at chromosome  <dig> or different copy numbers of α-tubulin genes in each homologous chromosome. indeed, similar observations have been described for l. braziliensis and other trypanosomatids regarding hsp <dig>  kmp- <dig> and histone h2a gene loci  <cit> . moreover, the presence of three hybridization bands in the lane containing psti digested-dna would be indicating that l. braziliensis has three homologous for chromosome  <dig>  a very plausible possibility taking into account recent studies showing that l. braziliensis genome is essentially triploid  <cit> .

sequence analysis of the α-tubulins in l. braziliensis
the genomic analysis described above indicated that the l. braziliensis α-tubulin genes are encoding for three different amino acids polypeptides: the prototypical α-tubulin  and two α-tubulin variants, dubbed α-tubulin-a  and α-tubulin-b  . the prototypical α-tubulin is a  <dig> amino acid protein with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . in contrast, the α-tubulin-a is a shorter sequence with  <dig> amino acids, molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and isoelectric point of  <dig> . similarly, the α-tubulin-b sequence contains  <dig> amino acids, has a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point of  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the α-tubulin-a is identical to the α-tubulin in the  <dig> n-terminal amino acids, but they are absolutely divergent in the rest of the sequence. an intriguing finding was the observation of a remarkable sequence identity  between the divergent region of gene lbrm. <dig>  and a genomic region of chromosome  <dig>  located at the intercoding region of genes lbrm. <dig>  and lbrm. <dig>  .

in contrast, α-tubulin-b sequence, excluding the 58 n-terminal amino acids, was found to be identical to the c-terminal half of the prototypical α-tubulin. also, this α-tubulin protein variant may have an extended sequence at the n-terminal region, since the lbrm. <dig>  annotated gene is close to a gap in the genomic sequence of the l. braziliensis genome database .

as mentioned above, if assembly artifacts exist in the l. braziliensis genome database, the real existence of the α-tubulin variants encoded by genes lbrm. <dig>  and lbrm. <dig>  may be questioned. to elucidate this, we have searched in the literature for experimental evidence of these genes or their products. the sole reference found is their presence in the gene lists generated by rogers and co-workers  <cit>  when analyzed the copy number of genes along the genome of l. braziliensis. however, this is not a demonstration of the real existence of these genes as the copy number was determined by mapping illumina reads to the reference genome  <cit> , but it was not analyzed whether the reads map homogenously along the gene orf. on the other hand, none of these genes have homologs in the l. braziliensis mhom/br/75/m <dig> strain  <cit> , in other leishmania species, even though several genomes have been sequenced , or in related trypanosomatids . finally, an additional finding pointing to a possible assembly error in gene lbrm. <dig>  is the fact that the region conserved with α-tubulin would extend further  if the nucleotide at position  <dig> is deleted .

the l. braziliensis α-tubulin locus at chromosome  <dig> contains two types of α-tubulin genes differing in their 3′ utr
given that leishmania genes are transcribed into polycistronic rna precursors that need to be further processed into individual mrnas by trans-splicing and polyadenylation, post-transcriptional regulation represents the main level of controlling gene expression in these parasites  <cit> . consequently, regulatory sequences located in the 5´ and 3´ untranslated region  are involved in the modulation of mrna processing, mrna stabilization/destabilization, mrna half-life, or translation efficiency  <cit> . to determine the utrs for l. braziliensis α-tubulin gene, rt-pcr reactions using specific oligonucleotides were performed. thus, it was possible to determine the 5´ utr region of the α-tubulin genes lbrm. <dig>  and lbrm. <dig> , which was  <dig> nucleotides in length and identical for both genes. this sequence was deposited in the genbank database under the accession number fj <dig>  and it was incorporated to the genedb database  <cit> . regarding the 3´ utr, by rt-pcr we determined that this region for lbrm. <dig>   is 369-nucleotide in length ; henceforth this sequence will be referred as 3´ utr-i. on the other hand, the 3´ utr of the last gene of the cluster , referred here as 3´utr-ii, was found to be highly divergent . taking into account that the l. braziliensis α-tubulin locus at chromosome  <dig> should be composed by 8– <dig> copies of the prototypic α-tubulin gene, but they collapsed to only two  during assembly process, it is reasonable concluding that the 3´ utr for the rest of genes would be identical or near-identical to the 3´ utr-i. similar situation has been reported in β tubulin array from l. major <cit> , and hsp <dig> genes  <cit>  in which the last gene of the tandem bears a 3´ utr different to that found in the rest of genes. the distinctive genomic environment provided by each 3´ utr type  might obey to a need of providing specific expression profiles that ensure the availability of the α-tubulin protein under different conditions as occurs with the hsp <dig> protein  <cit> . remarkably, bioinformatics analysis of these two sequences showed that whereas the 3´ utr-i  has a pre motif , which has been implicated in the promastigote-specific expression of several genes  <cit> , the 3´ utr-ii  has an are motif , which is recognized as an mrna instability element  <cit> .

the mrna levels for l. braziliensis α-tubulin are controlled post-transcriptionally by mechanisms sensitive to changes in environmental temperature
analysis of α-tubulin gene expression in l. braziliensis has not been addressed to date. early studies in leishmania enriettii demonstrated that in agreement with the greater tubulin content in the promastigote stage, the levels of α- and β-tubulin mrnas in the promastigotes were significantly higher than those found in amastigotes  <cit> . in l. major, using microarray hybridizations, it was found that α-tubulin mrnas are  <dig> -fold more abundant in promastigotes than in amastigotes  <cit> . however, in l. mexicana, similar amounts of tubulin mrnas were found in both promastigotes and amastigotes  <cit> . in the related trypanosomatid t. cruzi, the regulation of tubulin genes has been studied in some extent  <cit> . in this parasite, lower levels of the α- and β-tubulin transcripts are found in amastigotes and trypomastigotes compared to epimastigotes. experimental evidence suggests tubulin mrna half-lives are negatively affected by the amount of free, unpolimerized tubulin proteins. the regulatory mechanism would operate through the recognition of sequence elements located at the beginning of the coding region and in the 3´ utr of the tubulin genes  <cit> .

temperature shifts trigger differential gene expression and stage transformation in leishmania <cit> . thus, we first examined the effect of heat shock treatment on the l. braziliensis α-tubulin mrna stability. for this purpose, parasites were cultured at 35°c during several periods of time, determining the parasite morphology and α-tubulin mrna abundance at each time culture-point. as shown in figure  <dig>  as incubation time at 35°c was increased, clear alterations in the parasite morphology were observed; parasites turned into rounded shape forms. interestingly, a concomitant decrease in the α-tubulin mrna abundance was also observed, suggesting a down-regulation of α-tubulin mrnas levels during adaptation of the parasite to the mammalian host temperature.

in order to obtain clues about the regulatory mechanisms regulating mrna stability of the l. braziliensis α-tubulin genes, we used inhibitors of transcription , trans-splicing  and protein synthesis . the effects of these drugs were analyzed at both 26°c and 35°c for several periods of time . as expected, inhibition of transcription and mrna processing at 26°c, led to a continuous decrease in the α-tubulin mrnas . the decrease was more dramatic in parasites incubated at 35°c , suggesting the existence of a destabilizing mechanism operating at this temperature. a support for the existence of such a specific mechanism came from the observation that protein synthesis inhibition of l. braziliensis promastigotes at 35°c  but not at 26°c , led to an increase of the α-tubulin mrna half-lives. moreover, protein synthesis inhibition at 26°c  seems to have no effect on the decay rate of the α-tubulin mrnas . thus, it can be hypothesized the existence of a labile protein factor, induced during promastigote to amastigote differentiation, that is responsible of decreasing the α-tubulin mrna half-lives in the mammalian stage of l. braziliensis. this finding would be in agreement with the fact, known since the  <dig> decade, that tubulins are more abundant proteins in the promastigote stage than in the amastigote one  <cit> .

gene expression in trypanosomatids is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms relying on the modulation of mrna processing, mrna stabilization/destabilization, mrna half-life, translation efficiency or post-translational modifications  <cit> . accordingly, a variety of elements in the untranslated regions  have been shown to regulate these events  <cit> . now, in this study, the genomic organization and the structure of 5′ and 3′ utrs for α-tubulin genes have been determined. next step will be to investigate the involvement of the motifs contained in the 3′ utr-i and -ii sequences in the regulatory mechanisms controlling tubulin expression in l. braziliensis.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the genomic organization and genome distribution of α-tubulin genes in several leishmania species suggests that these genes have been reorganized in a drastic manner along leishmania speciation. nevertheless, the existence of a gene cluster, consisting of several copies of tandemly arranged α-tubulin genes, was found to be a common feature in the different leishmania species. in the l. braziliensis tandem array, two types of α-tubulin genes differing only in their 3´ utr were characterized: most of the α-tubulin gene copies have an identical 3´ utr , whereas the last copy of the tandem possesses a different sequence . finally, we demonstrated that mrna expression of l. braziliensis α-tubulin genes is controlled by a temperature-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism.
