BACKGROUND
corneal disease, one of the leading causes of blindness in china  <cit> , requires corneal transplantation to restore visual function in the majority of cases  <cit> . although immune privilege of corneal allografts endowed a higher success rate of corneal transplantation than other solid organ transplantation, immunological rejection is still the major cause of graft failure after penetrating keratoplasty  <cit> .

cd4+cd25+foxp3+regulatory t cells , an important regulator in maintaining immune homeostasis, play a crucial role in protecting individuals from graft rejection  <cit> . in light of this, these cells are now considered an important target for generating tolerance to solid organ transplants. however, it has been found that tregs can be subverted by inflammatory conditions and converted into interleukin- <dig> -producing t helper cells   <cit> . treg and th <dig> cells share a common requirement for tgf-β in their differentiation, despite expressing distinct transcriptional regulators  and demonstrating opposing functions. il- <dig> is involved in the allograft rejection, and il- <dig> antagonism prolongs graft survival  <cit> . the balance of treg-th <dig> axis and its shift toward the stabilization of treg populations are one of the key points in maintaining graft tolerance.

some cytokines or interventions have been proven to alter the treg-th <dig> balance. either il- <dig> or il- <dig> could inhibit treg induction and promote il- <dig> production, shifting the balance of the treg-th <dig> axis toward th <dig>  <cit> . however, the blockage of interferon regulatory factor  <dig> is beneficial in maintaining the foxp <dig> expression, which is crucial for the immunoregulatory function of tregs, and suppressing the production of il- <dig> and il- <dig>  as well as prohibiting the activation of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor  γt, the hallmark of th <dig> activation  <cit> .

recent studies show that the key metabolite of vitamin a, all-trans retinoid acid , potentiates tgf-β-dependent treg induction, while it reciprocally inhibits pro-inflammatory th <dig> differentiation ex vivo  <cit> . disrupted atra metabolism or signaling causes altered homing or impaired functional differentiation of the lymphocytes  <cit> . atra has been demonstrated to sustain the stability of foxp <dig> expression and suppress rorγt expression in vitro, maintaining the function of tregs and inhibiting th <dig> development  <cit> . however, the effect of atra on another pivotal transcriptional factor for the generation of th <dig> cells, rorα, remains unclear.

until now, regulation of the reciprocal differentiation of tregs and th <dig> cells has been investigated mainly in vitro. there have been few studies conducted on in vivo regulation. moreover, few reports have been published to explore the effect of atra on treg-th <dig> balance after allogenic organ or tissue transplantation. hence, we conducted this study to explore the effect of atra on treg-th <dig> balance after allogenic corneal transplantation and determine its correlation with the outcome of cornea grafts in recipient mice.

RESULTS
a mixed treatment of atra and tgf-β promotes graft survival
during the follow-up,  <dig> mice died unexpectedly, two in atra group , one in tgf-β group , three in atra + tgf-β group , two in control group  and one in synergistic group . the same number of recipient mice was recruited. so a total of  <dig> mice were censored, with an overall graft survival rate of 71%. the recipient mice treated with the combination of atra and tgf-β presented a graft acceptance rate of 82% at the end of the 8-week follow-up, which is significantly higher than those treated with atra alone , tgf-β alone  and a control solution . meanwhile, it didn’t have significant differences compared with syngeneic grafts , as shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
graft survival curve. each group contained at least  <dig> recipient mice at 14 days,  <dig> mice at 28 days and  <dig> mice at 56 days postoperative. the curve represents the average survival rate of each group. at the early time point , the grafts treated with either atra alone or the combination of atra and tgf-β had a modestly higher survival rate  than those treated with a control solution . nevertheless, a single administration of tgf-β did not promote graft survival at an early stage following surgery. in contrast, at a late time point , the survival rate of grafts treated with either atra or tgf-β solely was significantly higher than controls . a mixed administration of atra and tgf-β further promoted graft survival rate to 82%.

a mixed treatment of atra and tgf-β increases the foxp <dig> expression and inhibits the rorγt expression in grafts and pbmcs
at 2wks postoperative, the foxp <dig> gene expression in pbmcs was significantly higher in recipients treated with either atra or the combination of atra and tgf-β , while at 4wks postoperative, the foxp <dig> expression in the cornea grafts increased significantly in these two groups . a significantly lower rorγt expression in the pbmcs was found in those receiving a mixed treatment at 2wks postoperative , while the rorγt expression in the grafts was significantly lower in recipients treated with either tgf-β or the combination of atra and tgf-β at 4wks . the rorα expression in pbmcs was significantly higher in recipients treated with atra at 2wks . as for rorα expression in grafts, no statistical significance was found among the five groups, as shown in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
gene expression of foxp <dig>  rorγt and rorα in the grafts and pbmcs. at 2wks postsurgery, a mixed treatment of atra and tgf-β significantly promoted the foxp <dig> expression in pbmcs and suppressed the rorγt expression as well. at 4wks, the foxp <dig> expression increased significantly in the allogeneic grafts either with a mixed treatment or atra alone, and the reduced expression of rorγt was likewise found in these two groups. at each time point, each group contained at least five corneas and three blood samples. data are presented as the mean value ± standard error and are representative of at least two independent experiments. * p <  <dig> .

discussion
th <dig> cells, which recruit monocytes and neutrophils by the secretion of il- <dig> and suppress the expansion of regulatory t cells, have been implicated to be predominantly involved in the acute phase of allograft rejection  <cit> , especially within 5– <dig> days. this study confirmed that th <dig> cells were detrimental to allogeneic graft survival. moreover, we not only found the enhancement of th <dig> cells in peripheral blood and draining lymph nodes at the early stage of the rejection process after corneal transplantation, but also identified an increased number of il-17-positive cells in conjunctiva, enhanced expression of rorγt in cornea grafts and an elevated level of il- <dig> in the aqueous humor at the late stage of rejection process, which has not been reported by previous studies. we assumed that the disparities might be attributed to two reasons. first, unlike other solid organ transplantation, immunological rejection after allogeneic corneal transplantation does not affect the survival of the recipients, which is conducive to observing the long-term dynamic changes of th <dig> cells. second, the activated th <dig> cells might take some time to migrate from peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue into conjunctiva and further into cornea graft, since cornea is absent of blood and lymphatic vessels.

although cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs have strong immunosuppressive potency, they are present in very low numbers in a normal host and have an anergic phenotype. the upregulation of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs induced by certain agents, such as rapamycin and il- <dig>  has been proven to protect the allogeneic graft and prolong graft survival  <cit> . nevertheless, the expression of foxp <dig> is unstable and will be down-regulated in an il-6-rich, th17-promoting environment. when such treg ‘deprogramming’ occurs, tregs fail to exert their original immunoinhibitory role  <cit>  and may convert into competent foxp3- effector t cells, which up-regulate the rorγt expression  <cit> . inflammation-dampening strategies, particularly manipulating the inflammation occurring in the graft and draining lymph nodes, may guide the host immunity from an adverse effect toward tissue-protective phenotypes. therefore, shifting the th17-treg profile toward tregs and maintaining the foxp <dig> expression is crucial in protecting the allografts and achieving graft acceptance.

it has been shown that atra is one of potential therapeutic agents capable of skewing the treg–th <dig> axis away from a th <dig> response. retinoic acid was first identified as a potential regulator of t cell homing to the intestinal tract, with intestinal dendritic cells being unique in their production of retinoic acid  <cit> . a novel role of retinoic acid in the regulation of the th17–treg axis, inhibiting the development of th <dig> cells by splenic dendritic cells, was discovered by mucida et al.  <cit>  recent studies have demonstrated that the reduction in il- <dig> was accompanied by a reduction in the rorγt expression in response to atra  <cit> . furthermore, tregs expanded with atra are resistant to the inhibitory effects of il- <dig> on the foxp <dig> expression and prevent th <dig> conversion  <cit> , thus stabilizing the tregs population and function.

however, atra is not sufficient to convert mouse naïve t cells undergoing activation into foxp3+ t cells. many studies have confirmed that the tgf-β signal is additionally required for a reliable expression of foxp <dig> in t cells in vitro  <cit> . some findings suggested that atra enhanced tgf-β signaling by increasing the expression and phosphorylation of smad <dig> and also inhibited the expression of il- <dig> receptor α chain  <cit> . other findings suggested that atra reduced the stat <dig> binding to the foxp <dig> promoter or indirectly relieved inhibition of the tgf-β-mediated foxp <dig> expression from cytokine-producing cd4+cd44hi t cells and finally enhanced the foxp <dig> expression  <cit> . a few in vivo studies also confirmed that with the presence of tgf-β, atra promoted treg conversion and inhibited th <dig> induction  <cit> .

the combined administration of atra and tgf-β has been proven to attenuate heart, liver and trachea rejection  <cit> . the effect was attributed, at least partially, to the shifted balance of the th17-treg axis, meaning for the conversion of the cd4 + foxp3 + tregs and suppressed induction of the th <dig> cells. this study found that with the presence of tgf-β, atra could maximally promote allogeneic graft survival. in contrast, the treatment of atra alone could not entirely mitigate graft rejection. previous studies have demonstrated that without tgf-β, atra could not regulate tregs conversion but retained the ability to inhibit il- <dig> production  <cit> , which might be the possible explanation for the finding.

the overexpression of rorγt and rorα is characterized in the differentiation of th <dig> cells  <cit> . rorγt has been proposed as a ‘master regulator’ for th <dig> differentiation, while rorα seems to synergize with rorγt to promote th <dig> differentiation. it has been demonstrated that coexpression of rorγt and rorα synergistically enhances the number of il-17-producing cells  <cit> . however, this study found that the combined administration of atra and tgf-β inhibits the expression of rorγt rather than rorα, especially in the allograft. taking into consideration that rorα is not the major player in the induction of th <dig> cells and that atra might regulate th <dig> differentiation through other mechanisms  <cit> , the exact effect of atra on rorα merits further investigation.

our results showed an elevated level of il- <dig> in the aqueous humor at 4wks and 8wks postoperative. accordingly, a slit lamp and a histological examination at the same time points revealed graft angiogenesis and fibrous tissue proliferation. il- <dig>  the key cytokine produced by th <dig> cells, has been proven to recruit monocytes and neutrophils, promote angiogenesis  <cit> , and stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts  <cit> . many studies have confirmed that il- <dig> is involved in allograft rejection, and neutralization of il- <dig> inhibits accelerated allograft rejection. in contrast, il- <dig>  one of the most important immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by tregs, has been proven to favor allograft acceptance and has a close relationship with the allograft’s function  <cit> . various studies have reported that after solid organ transplantation, an elevated content of il- <dig> was found among patients with grafts accepted or without acute rejection episodes  <cit> , confirming its immunomodulatory effects. the combined treatment of atra and tgf-β could promote il- <dig> levels in the serum and aqueous humor and reduce il- <dig> expression simultaneously, and changes of these cytokines are consistent with the prognosis of cornea grafts. combining our results and previous findings, we deduce that although reducing the th <dig> generation and manipulating host inflammation may well be beneficial for the outcome of allograft, fostering regulatory-type alloimmunity is also essential to achieve lasting transplant tolerance and improve function posttransplant. nevertheless, the statistical differences for the level of il- <dig> are very small in this research and may not be biologically important. the exact role of il- <dig> in modulating immunological reaction toward allogeneic corneal grafts merits further studies.

apart from the effect on the treg-th <dig> axis, another beneficial outcome of atra to graft survival should also be taken into consideration. it has been shown that the recovery of corneal epithelial cells is important to graft survival after corneal transplantation. delayed epithelium recovery or persistent epithelial defect would hamper or even be detrimental to graft survival  <cit> . atra has been shown to promote corneal epithelium wound healing  <cit> . this study found that either single administration of atra or combined treatment of atra + tgf-β could improve graft survival at early time point after transplantation, indicating that the beneficial effect of atra to corneal epithelium recovery might also play an important role in promoting graft survival.

CONCLUSIONS
in brief, with the presence of tgf-β, the administration of atra not only promoted graft survival in recipient mice after allogeneic penetrating keratoplasty, but also simultaneously expanded the cd4 + cd25 + foxp3+ tregs and reduced the population of th <dig> cells in the peripheral blood, spleen and draining lymph nodes. our findings suggest that the combined application of atra and tgf-β may shift the th17-treg balance toward tregs, hence facilitating the induction of immunological tolerance after allogenic corneal transplantation and representing a potential therapeutic approach in the treatment of posttransplant rejection.
