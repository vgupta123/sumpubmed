BACKGROUND
thyroid hormones  have important roles in development and homeostasis. thyroid receptor  activation occurs when an agonist ligand such as th or similar compounds binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the core of its ligand-binding domain . this causes conformational changes which allow dna bound receptors to interact with coactivators, mediating transcription. th has a considerable potency as a cholesterol reducer in serum, and stimulates basal metabolic rate, promoting weight loss by the increase of thermogenesis  <cit> . however, deleterious side effects such as tachycardia and atrial arrhythmia are well-documented rendering th treatment unviable for the treatment of obesity and hypercholesterolemia  <cit> .

while th cannot be used to treat dyslipidemias and obesity, tr isoform selective agonists may counteract these problems. the human  tr exists in two isoforms, htrα , and htrβ . htrα is expressed at higher levels in heart and plays a major role in regulation of heart rate, whereas trβ is the predominant isoform that is expressed in the liver and pituitary and is involved with hepatic cholesterol metabolism and regulation of metabolic rate  <cit> . evidence from human patients and mouse models suggests that elevated cholesterol and body weight can be decreased by the preferential activation of htrβ versus htrα. since obesity and atherosclerosis are important medical problems with impact on morbidity and mortality, development of β-selective thyromimetics and improved understanding of their actions is an important pharmacological and biomedical issue.

similar to other nuclear receptors, trs exhibit a modular structure, composed of functionally separable domains. the most highly conserved domains are the lbd and dna binding domain , with the former responsible for multiple activities, including hormone binding, homo and/or heterodimerization, molecular interactions with heat-shock-proteins, and transcriptional activation and repression  <cit> . all of these properties are regulated by ligand-dependent conformational changes  <cit> . therefore, improved understanding of the three-dimensional structure of a liganded lbd and dynamic changes that occur on ligand binding are critical for understanding hormone action. while htrβ lbd crystal structures of complexes with natural hormones  and synthetic ligands  are available, structural information on htrα lbd is scarce  <cit> . even less information about the role of tr flexibility and dynamics in ligand binding is available. for example, it was only recognized recently that tr ligands dissociation  can proceed via multiple escape pathways that may be ligand specific  <cit> .

gc- <dig> -phenoxy acetic acid; fig. 1), is an analogue of the thyromimetic dimit that shows comparable affinity for htrβ <dig> to t <dig> and desirable isoform selectivity, binding to htrα <dig> with a 10-fold lower affinity  <cit> . gc- <dig> shows extremely encouraging results in animal models  <cit> . gc- <dig> lowers cholesterol in hypothyroid mice and monkeys at concentrations that do not affect heart rate and lowers ldl cholesterol with 600- to 1400-fold more potency and approximately two- to threefold more efficacy than atorvastatin  <cit> . gc- <dig> also decreases plasma levels of other atherogenic lipids; triglycerides and lipoprotein . further, gc- <dig> induces loss of body fat with no detectable loss of muscle  <cit> . finally, gc- <dig> stimulates important steps in reverse cholesterol transport  <cit> . gc- <dig> is also a synthetically accessible scaffold that serves as a platform for the development of new tr agonists and antagonists  <cit> . thus, improved understanding of the structural basis of gc- <dig> tr binding and selectivity is of paramount importance for the rational design of thyromimetics.

presently, only an x-ray structure of trβ in complex with gc- <dig> is available. while this structure reveals extensive hydrogen bond formation between the carboxylate tail of the ligand and polar residues in the hormone binding pocket, improved understanding of the molecular basis of isoform-selective binding awaits direct comparisons of structures of both tr isoforms in complex with this ligand  <cit> . here, we report the new structures of htrα and htrβ lbds in complex with gc- <dig> and t <dig> and results of md simulations performed with these structural models. our data suggests that most of the selective binding of gc- <dig> is related to alternate conformations of a conserved arg residue in the pocket  that, in turn, is influenced by selective interactions of this arg residue with the single isoform-selective residue in the pocket.

RESULTS
x-ray structures
cell-based assays confirmed that our preparation of gc- <dig>  has potent tr agonist activity, with maximum efficacy similar to that of t <dig> and selectivity for trβ vs. trα . co-crystallization of gc- <dig> with both htrα and htrβ yielded structures with good geometric and crystallographic parameters . the ramachandran plots are acceptable for both structures. these plots assess the main chain configuration of a protein by a 2d graph displaying the two torsional angles  of each amino acid residue, which should be clustered in regions that don't cause steric clashes between them. no residues were observed in the disallowed regions of the plots, except for arg <dig> in trα structure in p <dig>  electron density for the ligand was clear and well-defined in all the structures obtained.

ligand binding pocket
the tr ligand binding pocket is roughly subdivided in three regions, as shown in figure  <dig>  region i is largely hydrophobic but contains a single polar residue  which forms a hydrogen bond interaction with a hydroxyl group of most thyromimetics or thyroid hormones, including t <dig>  t <dig> and triac. th analogues synthesized without the phenol on that position tend to lack functionality  <cit> . region ii is mainly composed of apolar residues that interact with the thyronine rings of th derivatives or phenolic rings of thyromimetics such as gc- <dig>  region iii, occupied by the oxyacetic acid moiety of gc- <dig>  is mostly polar and is the likely location in which changes in interaction with t <dig> and gc- <dig> determine the selectivity of the compound because it harbours the only subtype selective residue in the htrα and htrβ binding pockets; htrα has a ser  <dig> residue, which is substituted by asn  <dig> in htrβ. gc- <dig> carboxyl group interactions are mostly mediated by three arginine residues  through water molecules supported hydrogen bonding network.

comparison of htrα and htrβ complexed with t <dig> confirms that there is a similar binding mode  <cit> . the hormone binds both receptors in the extended conformation forming the same interactions with the amino acid residues of the active sites . the lack of structural differences is consistent with the fact that t <dig> binds both tr isoforms with similar affinity.

by contrast, the binding modes of gc- <dig> are clearly different. similar to t <dig>  gc- <dig> binds both trs through a combination of hydrophobic interactions and two hydrogen bond sites. the first hydrogen bond involves the phenolic hydroxyl of the outer thyronine ring and a histidine residue in region i of the pocket . the second site involves the gc- <dig> oxyacetic acid substituent and the positively charged pocket formed by three arginine residues in region iii, arg228/ <dig>  arg262/ <dig> and arg266/ <dig> . in htrβ, arg <dig> from helix  <dig>  and arg <dig> and arg <dig> from helix  <dig> interact with the gc- <dig> oxyacetic acid carboxylate both directly and via water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions, as previously observed in a previous htrβ/gc- <dig> structure  <cit> . asn <dig> forms a hydrogen bond with arg <dig> that anchors the latter in place and permits it to form a stable interaction with the gc- <dig> carboxylate group.

in htrα, a different picture arises. first, the gc- <dig> oxyacetic acid ester oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain amino group of trα specific ser <dig> residue. the ser <dig> side chain hydroxyl participates in a hydrogen bond interaction with the ile <dig> main chain carbonyl group, which is not available to asn <dig> in htrβ. this means that ser <dig> fails to engage in a hydrogen bond contact with arg <dig> analogous to that observed between asn <dig> and arg <dig>  thus, arg <dig> is not anchored by contacts with the subtype specific residue. in addition, ser <dig> is displaced by  <dig>  Å toward the ligand compared to the t3-bound htrα <cit> . this effect, coupled with the fact that dislocation and the smaller size of ser relative to asp in trβ provides room for the arg <dig> side chain to move, permits arg <dig> to adopt apparent multiple conformations, as described below.

to distinguish between the conformations of the arg <dig> side chain, we will call the first, similar to the trβ +gc- <dig> structure, the productive conformation, and the two alternatives, the non-productive conformations. arg <dig> displays a double conformation in the first htrα crystal form : a productive conformation identical to that of htrβ and a non-productive conformation in which it points away from ligand . in the second crystal form  arg  <dig> is in another non-productive conformation  which is an intermediate between two conformations of the same residue found in the first crystal form. differential positioning of the arg <dig> side chain is related to hydrogen bond with the ser <dig> carbonyl group that flips the arg <dig> side chain into an alternative conformation . to compensate this conformational change, a water molecule  bridges the arg <dig> side chain and the gc- <dig> carboxylate group. this weakens direct interaction with arg <dig> and forces gc- <dig> into a new conformation which involves re-orientation of its carboxyl group.

thus, our structures reveal different binding modes for gc- <dig> in trα and trβ. in trβ a single productive conformation is observed, in which the ligand interacts strongly with arg <dig>  while this residue interacts with the carbonyl group of asn <dig>  in trα, multiple conformations are observed. in the productive conformation the ligand interacts strongly with the arg <dig> residue and with the ser <dig> by its oxyacetic oxygen. in the non-productive conformations gc- <dig> maintains the interaction with ser <dig> but the strong interaction of gc- <dig> with arg <dig> is lost, giving way to a hydrogen bond of this residue with the main carbonyl of ser <dig> 

molecular dynamics simulations
conformational variability of the arg <dig> residue in trα was also observed in md simulations . for htrβ the residue oscillates around a mean defined value, indicating a single conformation. in htrα, the rmsd of the arg <dig> side-chain has much larger flexibility, as shown in figure  <dig>  this is a result of the weaker anchoring it displays relative to the arg <dig> of trβ that interacts both with the ligand and with the asn <dig> residue. this weak anchoring of the arg <dig> residue allows for multiple binding modes, which are characterized by basically two different distances between the carboxylate of gc <dig> and arg <dig>  that can be seen in figure  <dig>  overlaps of snapshots of the simulations at different times in figure  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the conformations and the binding modes observed.

to understand whether the apparent instability of the gc-1-arg228α explains weaker ligand binding to this receptor isoform, we analyzed the energies of these interactions obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations. figure  <dig> shows a schematic representation of the binding modes of gc- <dig> in htrα and htrβ, together with the average energies of each interaction as computed by md simulations. in the productive conformations of gc- <dig> bound both to htrα and htrβ there is a strong  interaction between the gc- <dig> carboxylate and arg228/ <dig>  the second strongest interaction is the hydrogen bond that arg <dig> forms with the asn <dig> residue in the htrβ isoform . the corresponding arg228-ser <dig> interaction is comparatively weak . in the non-productive conformation observed in htrα, the gc-1-arg <dig> interaction is weakened to - <dig> kcal/mol. this conformational change is accompanied by the entrance of a water molecule that forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of gc- <dig>  also relevant is the fact that the arg <dig> residue in the non-productive conformations strengthens its interaction with ser <dig> . the ser277-ile <dig> interaction does not appear to be particularly relevant. the hydrogen bond of gc- <dig> with the ser <dig> is quite strong , and somewhat favours binding to htrα relative to htrβ. a slight rearrangement of the hydrophobic residues in the binding site is also observed, but the differences in interaction energies are negligible .

together, these data suggest a plausible explanation for the greater affinity of gc- <dig> for the htrβ isoform. the productive conformations of the arg228/ <dig> residues are the driving forces leading to ligand binding stabilization. very strong interactions of these residues with gc- <dig> appear in productive conformations of both tr-isoforms. the reason for the productive conformation to be more stable in htrβ than in htrα is related to the differences in the side-chains of the ser <dig> and asn <dig> residues. in htrβ, arg <dig> interacts, at the same time, with the carboxylate of the ligand and with the side chain of asn <dig>  which locks in place the productive conformation of the former residue. in htrα, arg <dig> has the potential to engage in strong charge-charge interactions with the ligand, but the short side-chain of ser <dig> residue is unable to lock it in place. therefore, the stabilization of the productive conformation resulting from the arg282-asn <dig> interaction is of key importance for htrβ selectivity of gc- <dig> 

specific binding of gc- <dig> is related to the absence of the amino group
why is this isoform-specific binding mode available to gc- <dig> and not t3? t <dig> contains an amino group that is missing from gc- <dig> and it is known that removal of the amino group in both t <dig> and gc- <dig> analogues improves β-selectivity. for t <dig>  the removal of the amino group results in a slightly β-selective ligand  <cit> . for gc- <dig> analogues it turns the dimit ligand  into the propionic-acid gc- <dig>  which is  <dig>  times selective towards trβ <dig>  superposition of structures of t <dig> and gc- <dig> bound to both tr isoforms reveals significant movement of the part of the tr polypeptide backbone containing the ser <dig> and asn <dig> residues in the gc- <dig> structures , that is a result of the absence of the t <dig> amino-ser277/asn <dig> interactions. this movement allows the ser <dig> and arg <dig> residues to interact with other residues of the binding pocket  in the presence of gc- <dig>  hence, removal of the t <dig> amino group allows for the displacement of the chains containing the ser <dig> and asn <dig> residues and resulting difference in binding modes; as described above, the asn331-arg <dig>  interaction stabilizes the productive conformation, while the ser277-ile <dig>  interaction has no effect on ligand affinity.

discussion
we have presented a structural investigation of ligand binding modes of the two isoforms of human tr with t <dig> and gc- <dig> and a computational analysis of the interaction energies involved in these systems. our findings suggest that the basis of gc- <dig> selectivity lies in the differences in ligand and protein conformations, which are related to the absence of the amino group relative to t <dig> and to the ser/asn active-site substitution. this substitution increases the space available to a conserved arg residue  permitting it to adopt multiple conformations that are indicative of increased flexibility. while htrβ arg <dig> binds to the ligand in a single conformation, htrα arg <dig> has the potential to flip away from the ligand in non-productive conformations, resulting in loss of an important interaction for the stabilization the ligand.

our model is supported by md simulations. the simulations reveal that, for gc- <dig> bound htrα, arg <dig> can assume multiple conformations, and although gc- <dig> has the additional interaction with ser <dig>  the overall binding energy of htrα is smaller. on the other hand, the productive conformation of arg <dig> with gc- <dig> in htrβ is very stable both in x-ray structure and in md simulations, being locked in place by the strong interaction of the side-chain of asn <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the x-ray structures of both thyroid hormone receptor isoforms as bound to gc- <dig> and to natural hormone t <dig> permitted the proposal of a β-selectivity mechanism for gc- <dig>  which is supported by molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes.

the major contributions for selectivity in gc- <dig> are the presence of an oxyacetic acid ester oxygen and the absence of the amino group relative to t <dig>  these features favour different conformations for residues in the binding site which, as described, modify the binding network of the ligand for the two isoforms.

in summary, our analysis sheds light into the molecular basis of trβ-selectivity of gc- <dig> and may assist rational design of new th analogs with improved trβ selectivity lacking the undesirable properties of the natural hormones.
