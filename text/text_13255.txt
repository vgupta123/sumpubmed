BACKGROUND
h <dig> is a paternally imprinted gene encoding a noncoding rna  <cit> . as one of the first imprinted genes discovered, h <dig> was initially identified as a tumor suppressor because embryo-derived tumor cells overexpressing h <dig> exhibited growth retardation, morphological changes and abrogated clonogenicity in soft agar, as well as suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice  <cit> . downregulation of h <dig> gene expression was identified as an early event in the formation of several tumor types  <cit> . recently it was demonstrated that mice lacking h <dig> showed an overgrowth phenotype, while transgenic mice overexpressing h <dig> showed postnatal growth reduction  <cit> .

in contrast, overexpression or loss of imprinting  of h <dig> has been observed in a wide variety of tumors, including bladder carcinoma  <cit> , epithelial ovarian cancer  <cit> , esophageal cancer  <cit> , lung cancer  <cit> , breast adenocarcinoma  <cit> , endometrial cancer  <cit> , and invasive cervical carcinoma  <cit> . h <dig> knockdown significantly decreased the clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth property of several breast and lung cancer cell lines  <cit> . a link between h <dig> and several tumorigenesis-related genes, such as c-myc <cit> , thioredoxin <cit>  and e2f <dig> <cit> , has been well established. thus, it remains controversial whether h <dig> functions as a tumor promotor or a tumor suppressor, and it is possible that h <dig> plays differential roles depending on tissue type and/or developmental stage  <cit> .

h <dig> is highly expressed in trophoblast tissue, predominantly but not exclusively from the maternal allele  <cit> . complete hydatidiform moles  showed high-level expression of h <dig> from the paternal allele, while choriocarcinomas developing from chms had reduced numbers of h19-positive cells  <cit> . h <dig> downregulation was also observed in gestational trophoblastic tumors  <cit> . these observations appear to support the notion that h <dig> functions as a tumor suppressor in trophoblast tissue. however, ariel i et al. found that h <dig> expression was found to be abundant, in a decreasing order, in the intermediate trophoblast , the cytotrophoblast, and the syncytiotrophoblast. and prominent expression of h <dig> was found in placental site trophoblastic tumor and gestational choriocarcinoma  <cit> . after choriocarcinoma-derived jeg- <dig> cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, a five-fold increase in h <dig> rna level was detected in the resulting tumors, and cells highly expressing h <dig> were more tumorigenic  <cit> . therefore, the exact role of h <dig> in the trophoblast is yet undetermined.

in previous studies, we demonstrated that dna methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine could demethylate the promoter region of the h <dig> gene, upregulate the expression of h <dig> transcript, and reduce the proliferation, migration and invasion properties of choriocarcinoma-derived jeg- <dig> cells  <cit> . as the demethylating effects of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine are unspecific, other genes may be demethylated in tandem and complicate the biological effects. to further clarify our understanding of the function of the h <dig> gene in choriocarcinoma, we developed lentiviral vectors expressing h19-specific small interfering rna  for use in human choriocarcinoma cells. considering that the human choriocarcinoma cell line jar is more easily infected by lentiviruses than the cell line jeg- <dig> , jar cells were used in the present study. using the sirna technology, we investigated the impact of h <dig> knockdown on the proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of jar cells. furthermore, we examined the effects of h <dig> knockdown on the expression of the insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , hairy and enhancer of split homologue- <dig> , and dual-specific phosphatase  <dig>  genes, which were chosen based on the previous evidence that h <dig> is a negative regulator of igf <dig> <cit>  and our unpublished observation that the expression of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> genes was altered in jeg- <dig> cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector carrying the full-length h <dig> cdna.

methods
cell culture
human choriocarcinoma cell line jar was purchased from american type culture collection . after thawing, cells were allowed to grow in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium/ham’s nutrient mixture f <dig>  medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co <dig>  after three passages, cells were used for viral infection.

construction and screening of lentiviral vectors harboring h19-specific sirna
the following sirna target sequences in the human h <dig> gene  were selected: target <dig>  gccttcaagcattccatta; target <dig>  ggagagttagcaaaggtga; target <dig>  cgtgacaagcaggacatga; and target <dig>  gaggaaccagacctcatca. four pairs of complementary oligonucleotides were then designed . the stem-loop oligonucleotides were synthesized and cloned into a lentivirus-based vector carrying the green fluorescent protein  gene . a universal sequence  was used as a negative control for rna interference. lentiviral particles were prepared as previously described  <cit> .

the four sirna-carrying lentiviral vector constructs were used to infect jar cells at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  and  <dig> . three days after infection, gfp expression was detected to calculate the infection efficiency. five days after infection, cells were harvested. real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  was performed to determine h <dig> knockdown efficiency and screen for the sirna with the highest knockdown efficiency which was then used for subsequent experiments.

rna isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative pcr
total rna isolation using trizol reagent  and reverse transcription using moloney murine leukemia virus  reverse transcriptase  were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. quantitative pcr was performed in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μl cdna,  <dig>  μl primers  and  <dig> μl sybr premix extaq . the cycling conditions were: 95°c for  <dig> min;  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> s and 60°c for  <dig> s; and one cycle of 95°c for  <dig> s, 55°c for  <dig> s and 95°c for  <dig> s. the sequences of primers used in real-time rt-pcr were as follows: forward 5′-tcccagaacccacaacatgaa-3′ and reverse 5′-ttcaccttccagagccgattc-3′ for h <dig> ; forward 5′-tcctcacctcgctactcg-3′ and reverse 5′-acatccacgcaacactcag-3′ for dusp <dig> ; forward 5′-gagaggcggctaaggtgtttg-3′ and reverse 5′-ctggtgtagacggggatgac-3′ for hes- <dig> ; forward 5′-cctccagttcgtctgtggg-3′ and reverse 5′-cacgtccctctcggacttg-3′ for igf <dig> ; and forward 5′-ggcggcaccaccatgtaccct-3′ and reverse 5′-aggggccggactcgtcatact -3′ for beta-actin . data analysis was performed using the 2-ΔΔct method. the experiment was independently repeated three times.

cell cycle analysis
cells were seeded onto six-well plates and cultured. upon reaching 80% confluence, cells were released by digestion with trypsin and harvested. after centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed twice with pre-cooled phosphate buffered saline  and fixed with pre-cooled 70% ethanol. then, cells were resuspended in pbs, filtered through a 400-mesh sieve, and stained with propidium iodide  at 37°c for  <dig> min. the cell cycle was then determined by flow cytometry as previously described  <cit> .

apoptosis assay
apoptosis was detected using the aposcreen annexin v apoptosis kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. in addition, one more group of cells was incubated with  <dig> μg/ml diaminedichloroplatinum  for  <dig> hours and subjected to apoptosis assay. the experiment was independently repeated three times.

methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium  assay
cells were seeded in sextuplicate for each condition in 96-well plates at a density of 2×104/ml in  <dig> μl per well. after  <dig> hours of culture, medium was replaced. cells were then further cultured in this manner for 1– <dig> days. four hours before the termination of culture, mtt  was added at a volume of  <dig> μl per well. afterwards, the entire supernatant was discarded and dimethyl sulfoxide  was added at a volume of  <dig> μl per well and incubated in an air bath shaker at 37°c for  <dig> min. the absorbance at  <dig> nm of each well was determined using the  <dig> multilabel counter . the experiment was independently repeated three times.

cell invasion assay
the cell invasion assay was performed using a commercial kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the chemicon cell invasion assay is performed in an invasion chamber, a 24-well tissue culture plate with  <dig> cell culture inserts. the inserts contain an  <dig> μm pore size polycarbonate membrane, over which a thin layer of ecmatrixtm is dried. the ecmatrixtm layer serves as an in vitro reconstituted basement membrane and occludes the membrane pores, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through. invasive cells, on the other hand, migrate through the ecm layer and cling to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane. before jar cells were plated at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells in each insert,  <dig> μl of warm serum free media were added to the interior of the inserts to rehydrate the ecm layer for 1– <dig> hours at room temperature. cells were incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig> for  <dig> h. a cotton-tipped swab was used to gently remove non-invading cells as well as the ecmatrix gel from the interior of the inserts. five hundred microliters of staining solution were added to the unoccupied wells of the plate. invasive cells on lower surface of the membrane were stained by dipping inserts in the staining solution for  <dig> minutes. inserts were dipped in a beaker of water several times to rinse and air dried. stained cells were dissolved in 10% acetic acid and od at  <dig> nm was detected by colorimetric reading. each assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using spss  <dig>  software package . numerical data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. multiple means were compared using analysis of variance and the tukey post hoc test, while two means were compared using student’s t-test. a p value of less than  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
selection of the lentiviral vector harboring sirna with the highest knockdown efficiency
the four lentiviral constructs harboring different sirnas  were used to infect jar cells. in parallel, a negative control  was run. the infection efficiencies of these lentiviral vectors were all above 80% as revealed by fluorescence microscopy . real-time rt-pcr assay showed that all four constructs, whether they were used at a high or low moi, could significantly downregulate h <dig> gene expression in jar cells . the highest knockdown efficiency was achieved using kd <dig> , which was subsequently designated as h19-rnai-lv- <dig> 

h <dig> knockdown inhibited the proliferation of jar cells
the percentage of cells in g <dig> phase was significantly higher in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group , while the percentages of cells in g2/m phase and s phase respectively showed no significant changes between the two groups . the mtt assay showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in the h <dig> knockdown group as compared to that in the nc group  .

h <dig> knockdown inhibited apoptosis of jar cells
as shown in figure  <dig>  h <dig> knockdown significantly increased the percentage of normal cells but decreased the percentage of early apoptotic cells when compared to the negative control group . after incubation with diaminedichloroplatinum  for  <dig> hours, the percentage of normal cells was still significantly higher in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group , while the percentage of early apoptotic cells was still significantly lower in the h <dig> knockdown group than in the nc group .

h <dig> knockdown does not alter the invasion of jar cells
to determine if h <dig> knockdown was able to affect the invasion properties of jar cells, the cell invasion assay was performed. the invasion rate of cells in the h <dig> knockdown group and the nc group were  <dig> % ±  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> %, respectively. h <dig> knockdown had no significant impact on the invasion rate of jar cells. the result was shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

h <dig> knockdown upregulated hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> expression but not igf <dig> expression
to gain insight into how h <dig> knockdown alters the phenotype of human choriocarcinoma cells, we examined the expression of igf <dig>  hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> mrnas by real-time rt-pcr. the results showed that, compared with the negative control group, h <dig> knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> mrnas , but had no significant impact on the expression of igf <dig> mrna . the ct values were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

discussion
using a lentiviral vector harboring h19-specific sirna, the expression of h <dig> in jar cells was specifically downregulated. we showed that the invasion of jar cells was not affected in response to h <dig> downregulation, which is inconsistent with our previous studies indicating that 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-mediated h <dig> upregulation could reduce the invasion capacity of jeg- <dig> cells  <cit> . this may be due to unspecific demethylating effects of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine or differences among the cell types studied. furthermore, we also demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown inhibited the apoptosis and proliferation properties of jar cells. the results of the present study indicate that h <dig> exerts both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects in choriocarcinoma cells, at least in part, by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.

it has been hypothesized for many years that a potential tumor suppressor gene is present at chromosome 11p <dig>  where h <dig> is located, because a loss of heterozygosity at this locus is observed in certain embryonal tumors  <cit> . subsequent experiments implicated h <dig> may function as a tumor suppressor  <cit> . however, other studies provided conflicting evidence that supported the idea that h <dig> rna harbors oncogenic properties  <cit> . similar observations have been made in trophoblast tissue; some studies revealed that h <dig> has tumor-suppressing activity  <cit> , while others suggested that it has tumor-promoting activity  <cit> . therefore, h <dig> may play differential roles under different physiologic conditions. in the present study, we demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown could simultaneously inhibit the proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells, suggesting that h <dig> expression may have both proliferation-inducing and apoptosis-inducing activity in choriocarcinoma-derived cells. interestingly, a key event in tumorigenesis is the loss of equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell death  <cit> . thus, our observation that h <dig> can simultaneously induce proliferation and apoptosis highlights a putative dual role of h <dig> in choriocarcinoma cell lines and may explain the debate over whether h <dig> is a tumor suppressor or a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. shoshani o et al. discovered that direct knockdown of h <dig> expression in diploid tumorigenic mouse mesenchymal stromal cells resulted in acquisition of polyploid cell traits. and artificial tetraploidization of diploid mscs reduces tumorigenic potential in conjunction with suppression of h <dig> expression. this establishs a link between h <dig> expression and cell ploidy. poluploidization might either have a cancer promoting or a cancer-preventing effect as is the case in aneuploidy  <cit> . then, further experiments should determine whether the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis by h <dig> knockdown is associated with the polyploidy of trophoblast cells. however, since the human choriocarcinoma cell line jar may already have a different h <dig> gene regulatory pattern from normal trophoblasts, the extrapolation of results from jar cells to the normal trophoblast must be cautious. further studies in normal trophoblast cells should be done to address this issue.

like h <dig>  igf <dig> is an imprinted gene and the two are closely linked. however, while h <dig> is expressed from the maternal allele, igf <dig> is transcribed from the paternal allele in most tissues  <cit> . a growing body of evidence has indicated that h <dig> rna is a negative regulator of igf <dig>  gabory et al. <cit>  demonstrated that h <dig> transgenic or knockout mice developed abnormal phenotypes due to alterations in igf <dig> mrna levels. esquiliano et al. <cit>  found that targeted disruption of the h <dig> gene in mice induced the placental phenotype via upregulation of igf <dig> expression. in the present study, we have demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown had no significant impact on the expression of igf <dig> mrna. nevertheless, this result is not too surprising because numerous studies have not been able to provide a consistent relationship between the expression levels and imprinting status of h <dig> and igf <dig> in all tissues. adam et al. <cit>  discovered that h <dig> showed biallelic expression in extravillous cytotrophoblasts, while igf <dig> showed monoallelic expression. lustig-yariv et al. <cit>  showed that h <dig> and igf- <dig> rna levels differed greatly among different jar or jeg- <dig> clones. moreover, we also found that both h <dig> and igf- <dig> rnas were highly expressed in normal term placenta and jeg- <dig> cells, and h <dig> overexpression did not alter igf <dig> expression in jeg- <dig> cells . therefore, these data suggest that igf <dig> may not be involved in h <dig> downregulation-mediated inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells.

our results did show that h <dig> knockdown significantly upregulated expression of the hes- <dig> gene in jar cells. hes- <dig> gene is an important effector of the notch pathway that has been implicated in regulating the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in multiple tumor cell types. kunnimalaiyaan et al. <cit>  found that increased hes- <dig> expression suppressed the proliferation of carcinoid tumor cells. nefedova et al. <cit>  demonstrated that overexpression of hes- <dig> abrogated gamma-secretase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. importantly, we also found that h <dig> overexpression could downregulate the expression of hes- <dig> in jeg- <dig> cells  . thus, we speculated that hes- <dig> may mediate h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. although it remains unclear how h <dig> knockdown upregulates hes- <dig> expression in jar cells, the recent finding that h <dig> can negatively regulate an imprinted gene network may provide some clues to the mechanisms of regulation of hes- <dig> expression by h <dig> <cit> .

furthermore, we demonstrated that h <dig> knockdown could also significantly upregulate the expression of dusp <dig> gene in jar cells. the dusp <dig> gene encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase . it has been shown that extracellular signal regulated kinase  <dig>  is a specific substrate of dusp <dig> <cit> . as erk <dig> plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis, it is reasonable to surmise that dusp <dig> may also be involved in such processes. importantly, we also found that h <dig> overexpression could downregulate the expression of dusp <dig> in jeg- <dig> cells  . therefore, dusp <dig> may also be involved in h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides evidence that h <dig> knockdown does not alter invasion but inhibits proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells. the observation that h <dig> downregulation simultaneously suppresses proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells suggests a putative dual functionality of h <dig> in choriocarcinoma cell lines and may explain the debate over whether h <dig> is a tumor suppressor or a tumor promotor in trophoblast tissue. moreover, we also found that h <dig> knockdown upregulates the expression of the hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> genes but not of the igf- <dig> gene, suggesting that hes- <dig> and dusp <dig> may mediate h <dig> downregulation-induced suppression of proliferation and apoptosis of jar cells.
