BACKGROUND
leishmaniasis, a vector-borne parasitic infection, is caused by protozoans of the genus leishmania, which present a worldwide distribution. this disease is characterized by its diversity and complexity, presenting a wide spectrum of clinical forms in humans, ranging from self-healing skin lesions to fatal visceral leishmaniasis, depending on parasite species and host factors  <cit> .

in brazil, both clinical forms are present and, currently, leishmaniasis can be classified as a disease in expansion and without effective control  <cit> . one important etiological agent of human leishmaniasis in brazil is leishmania  amazonensis, which causes a wide spectrum of clinical diseases  <cit> . interestingly, recent findings indicate that the geographical distribution of l.  amazonensis is increasing, accounting for unusual clinical presentations in new transmission areas, specifically rio de janeiro state  <cit> .

amastigote forms of leishmania are intracellular parasites, inhabiting preferentially cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, and present a series of adaptive peculiarities in this phase of the biological cycle. these adaptations allow the parasites to escape or interfere with the host immune responses and, consequently, maintain the infection. the host immunological profiles during leishmania infections are widely studied using the murine model, as distinct leishmaniasis clinical manifestations can be reproduced in inbred mice strains .

in the murine leishmania  major infection model it has been established that a t-helper cell type  <dig>  immune response is effective against the parasites, while a th <dig> response may lead to disease exacerbation. thus, in this system, the outcome of infection is determined by the balance between these two types of response  <cit> . however, this dichotomy is not so clearly observed in murine infections caused by the leishmania  mexicana complex species, as l.  amazonensis, where the susceptibility of the host to the infection seems to be associated with an insufficient th <dig> response rather than a dominant th <dig> response  <cit> . the distinct levels of susceptibility to infection observed in different mouse strains, e.g. balb/c mice being highly susceptible and cba mice having some degree of resistance, may be due to differences in a mixed th responses balance rather than determined by a single dominant response. additionally, regulatory cytokines, as il- <dig>  might influence the outcome of the infection in a manner not directly linked to the th1/th <dig> dichotomy  <cit> .

in this context, cysteine proteinases   are virulence factors for leishmania with immunoregulatory properties during infection  <cit> . most of the studies on leishmania cps are centered in a few enzymes, denominated cpa, cpb and cpc, all of which are similar to papain and belong to the same group of cps . however, a detailed analysis of the l.  major genome database revealed the existence of genes predicted to codify for a total of  <dig> cps, subdivided into  <dig> clans and  <dig> families  <cit> .

the current focus of our studies is cpb, a cathepsin l-like enzyme  <cit> , which presents exclusive characteristics when compared to other cps: an extension of approximately  <dig> aa in its cooh-terminal region and the presence of multicopies organized as tandem array in the parasite genome  <cit> . cpb from l.  mexicana and l.  amazonensis have been shown to have a role on the th1/th <dig> responses balance by cleaving type ii major histocompatibility complex  molecules in the host parasitophorous vacuole  <cit> , cleaving the interleukin - <dig> and immunoglobulin  e receptors, inducing il- <dig> expression  <cit> , inhibiting il- <dig> production in macrophages and dentritic cells  <cit>  and by cleaving host nuclear factor kappa b   <cit> . considering that during the processing of pre-cpb to its mature form the cooh-terminal extension is processed  <cit> , secreted  <cit>  and can be observed within host cells  <cit> , this released fragment may also play a role in the host-parasite interaction  <cit> .

our group previously published an in silico study, using the analysis of physicochemical characteristics as parameter for t cell epitopes prediction, that allowed the identification of three peptides from l.  mexicana cpb cooh-terminal extension. in that study, three peptides with electric charges, hydrophobicity and isoelectric points compatible with the binding to mhc molecules were selected  <cit> .

these peptides were chemically synthesized and used in vivo and in vitro studies using balb/c and cba mice. one of these peptides caused an exacerbating effect on balb/c mice lesions, when used in vaccination assays. moreover, lymphoproliferative assays indicated that cd8+ t cells proliferated more intensely than cd4+ t cells in the presence of that same peptide. when cytokine levels were assessed, interferon-Î³ , a th <dig> response-related cytokine, was detected only in the supernatant of cba lymph node cell culture, while il- <dig>  a th <dig> response-related cytokine, was detected in the supernatant of cell culture from both lineages. additionally, nitric oxide  was detected only in the supernatant of cba cell cultures  <cit> .

such data corroborated the potential of cpb as an inducer of a th <dig> immune response, showing that peptides derived from this enzyme may be influential co-stimulatory signals in t-cell polarization during leishmaniasis, able to interfere in the balance of the th immune responses.

in the present study, we searched further for immunomodulatory peptides derived from the cooh-terminal extension of l.  amazonensis cpb. this was achieved by using current online algorithms to directly define peptides able to bind to mhc molecules and by using in vitro assays to assess the effect of the various peptides on mouse strains with distinct levels of susceptibility to l.  amazonensis infection.

RESULTS
sequencing of the l.  amazonensis cpb cooh-terminal extension
l.  amazonensis cpb cooh-terminal extension encoding genome sequence was amplified and cloned using primers previously produced for an analogous region of l.  pifanoi cpb. after determination of the dna sequence, it was used as basis for deducing amino acids sequence of the cooh-terminal extension .

this sequence presented up to 93% of identity with sequences of cps from other leishmania species belonging to the l.  mexicana complex and up to 68% with species from other complexes, as indicated by a protein blast analysis using the compositional matrix adjust method.

in silico prediction of t cell epitopes present at the cooh-terminal extension of l.  amazonensis cpb
the deduced amino acids sequence for the cooh-terminal extension of l.  amazonensis cpb was analyzed by online algorithms to predict proteasome cleavage  and mhc-binding peptides . only peptides commonly predicted by the three algorithms used were considered for this study . these predicted epitopes were then synthesized for in vitro analyses. all synthetic peptides were tested for endotoxin presence and presented values below the assay threshold .

each synthetic peptide was assayed only with the mouse strain that presented the haplotype to which it showed binding properties in syfpeithi analysis. thus, p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were assayed only with balb/c mice, p <dig> and p <dig> were assayed only with cba mice, while p <dig> and p <dig> were assayed with both mice strains.

t lymphocytes proliferative responses induced by synthetic peptides
assays carried out with balb/c cells showed that peptides p <dig> and p <dig> were able to induce a low level of cell proliferation when co-incubated with lymph node cells  . as for cba mice cells, peptides p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> also showed activity  . positive blastogenesis control with con a showed a  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold increase in cell numbers for balb/c and cba cell cultures, respectively. specific blastogenic response control with particulate leishmania antigen  also showed a slight proliferation .

influence of the predicted epitopes on lymph node cells phenotype
balb/c lymph node cell cultures incubated with peptides p <dig> and p <dig> showed a decrease in the percentage of cd8+ t cells . in contrast, peptide p <dig> was able to increase the percentage of balb/c cd8+ t cells present in the cultures by 34% . as for the percentage of cd4+ t cells in the cultures, p <dig> was able to reduce the number of this cell type in the balb/c lymph node cells by 65% . none of the tested peptides was able to significantly alter cd8+ or cd4+ percentages in lymph node cell cultures from cba mice.

p <dig> showed a strong influence over both cd4+ and cd8+ in balb/c cells, being able to alter the proportions between these two cell types in the culture. while the cd8+:cd4+ proportion in control cultures was of  <dig> , p8-incubated cultures presented a proportion of  <dig> . peptides p <dig> and p <dig> also altered the proportion between these two cell types, but as they influenced only cd8+ cell numbers these alterations were less significant, establishing a cd8+:cd4+ proportion of  <dig> , after incubation with peptides.

blastogenesis positive control  did not present any variations on cd8+:cd4+ proportions, while cultures with pla showed results comparable to what was observed for p8: cd8+ cells percentage increased by 115%, cd4+ cells percentage decreased by 75% and cd8+:cd4+ proportion of  <dig> .

production of cytokines and nitric oxide by cells in culture incubated with predicted epitopes
the levels of expression of cytokines related to th <dig> and th <dig> responses were analyzed in the supernatants of lymph node cell cultures co-incubated with the synthetic peptides. also, the levels of il- <dig> expression, a cytokine currently known to act in regulation of immune responses, were tested. in parallel, the no levels in these supernatants were also analyzed. the basic values of all the assays  were subtracted from the values obtained from all the samples and positive controls. the cytokine profiles in these cell cultures can be related to the capacity of the infected mice to control leishmania infection, thus these parameters were analyzed in cell cultures from balb/c  and cba  mice. one th2-related cytokine , two th1-related cytokines  and one regulatory cytokine  were tested.

results presented are from a representative assay from three independent repeats using lymph nodes from  <dig> infected mice. results are presented as mean Â± standard deviation values. nd - below the threshold established by control group.

in balb/c cell cultures, peptides p <dig> and p <dig> promoted the expression of th1-related cytokines , while p <dig> promoted the expression of il- <dig>  the peptide p <dig> was able to induce cytokines from distinct th responses in these cell cultures . con a and pla controls were able to induce the expression of all tested cytokines.

assays with cba cells evidenced the capacity of peptides p <dig> and p <dig> to induce the expression of a th1-related cytokine , whereas peptides p <dig> induced the expression of a regulatory cytokine . as observed in balb/c cell cultures, one of the tested peptides  was able to promote the expression of cytokines from multiple th responses . in cba cell cultures, con a displayed an activity similar to the pattern observed with balb/c cells, but pla was unable to promote il- <dig> expression, although inducing the expression of all other tested cytokines.

none of the tested peptides was able to induce no production in cell cultures from the tested murine strains, although, in balb/c cultures, con a and pla enhanced no levels in supernatants. in cba cell cultures, only pla enhanced no levels in the supernatant.

h-2/peptides complexes interactions predicted by molecular docking assays
the number of hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts, along with the intermolecular energies of the complexes were calculated using virtual models by molecular docking assays . such data are important to verify if binding of peptides to h- <dig> cleft, according to molecular docking analysis, is feasible.

redocking assays of the peptides, originally present in the cleft, were used as control. for h-2kk/1zt <dig> complex, redocking assays presented 18% of success rate , while h-2kd/1vgk assays presented 100% of success under the same parameter. the significantly lower success rate observed for h-2kk/1zt <dig> complex redocking can be related to the higher number of side chain dihedral angles of the ligand , whereas peptide 1vgk presents  <dig> points of torsion. despite the apparent low redocking success rate for h-2kk/1zt <dig> complex, the best model obtained by the in silico assays presented an excellent match with the crystallized structure, thus proving adequate for the proposed analysis.

molecular interaction data may also be helpful to understand how the h- <dig> molecules and ligands interact, when a qualitative/quantitative analysis is applied rather than a simply quantitative one, and the observed molecular interaction patterns can be related to the biological effects caused by the peptides.

the docking assays predicted that some amino acids from the h- <dig> cleft present key importance in the interaction of the mhc molecule with the epitope, evidenced through their capacity of forming a high number of hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions. for the haplotype d  these apparently prevalent amino acids were: gln  <dig>  arg  <dig>  trp  <dig>  arg  <dig>  thr  <dig>  trp  <dig>  tyr  <dig> and tyr  <dig>  also, some amino acids seem to have importance only for van der waals interactions: phe  <dig>  tyr  <dig> and trp  <dig>  for the h-2kk haplotype , the relevant amino acids for hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions were: asn  <dig>  asn  <dig>  tyr  <dig>  tyr  <dig>  trp  <dig> and asn  <dig>  whereas those in which van der waals interactions significantly contributed were: tyr  <dig>  arg  <dig>  tyr  <dig>  arg  <dig> and tyr  <dig> 

in addition, the participation of some residues from the mhc cleft in the epitope binding was observed as exclusively or predominantly occurring for peptides able to induce the expression of a specific cytokine or a combination of cytokines in the cell cultures. interactions were considered exclusive when formed only by peptides capable to induce a specific cytokine, while predominant interactions were formed by peptides able to induce a specific cytokine at least two times more frequently than by other peptides .

hydrogen bonds  and van der waals contacts  were predicted by in silico molecular docking assays. exclusive interactions  were predicted only between the specified murine strain h-2k molecule and the peptides that induce the discriminated cytokine production in lymph node cell cultures. predominant interactions, despite not being exclusive, were predicted to occur at least twice more frequently for specific cytokine production-related peptides. *np - none predicted.

discussion
infection by leishmania is a very complex process where both the host immune system and parasite virulence components interact and influence each other to respond in specific ways, thus determining the outcome of the infection. some l.  amazonensis factors are able to directly interfere with the host immune system and lead to a response that benefits parasite survival  <cit> .

in the present study, we have aimed at defining a strategy that, combining in silico and in vitro assays, would help to identify peptides from l.  amazonensis that present immunoregulatory properties. we based our present analysis on putative epitopes derived from the cooh-terminal extension from l.  amazonensis cpb, as our group had previously studied, by other methodologies, epitopes from this same region  <cit> . in our previous reports, epitopes mapping was performed by analyzing structural and chemical information of amino acids sequences rather than by applying sequences to algorithms designed for the simulation of epitopes processing and mhc interaction.

we initially sequenced the cooh-terminal region from l.  amazonensis cpb. the sequence obtained, although very similar to the sequence described for l.  mexicana, presented some differences in its deduced amino acid sequence, thus indicating the possible existence of epitopes exclusive for l.  amazonensis. these exclusive epitopes may be related to some particularities of the infection caused by this leishmania species, perhaps contributing to the stimulus of sub-populations of cd4+ t cells related to pathogenesis  <cit> .

a previous study reported the prediction of murine mhc class i-binding epitopes from l.  major proteins using online algorithms. differences in the number of predicted epitopes between a susceptible and a resistant mice strain were observed  <cit> . however, no in vitro analysis of the predicted epitopes was carried out and the prediction strategy was focused on finding as many epitopes as possible, merging results from four algorithms.

in the present study, we used a different strategy: by selecting only peptides which were predicted by all algorithms used , we simulated actual epitope processing and, thus, selected only epitopes that had a high possibility to exist during murine infection. additionally, we performed in vitro assays with synthetic versions of our selected epitopes, to test how accurate in silico prediction would be in selecting epitopes with immune effects during experimental infection.

we used a total lysate extract from the parasite , as a specific positive control in our assays, since it contains many potential antigens. this control induced blastogenesis in cell cultures from infected mice, apparently favoring cd8+t cells proliferation and inducing the production of cytokines related to multiple th immune responses. such effects of pla are compatible to what was observed previously for another parasites lysate extract  <cit>  and may account for the differences observed between infections with l.  amazonensis or l.  major in mice: while a mixed th response profile can be observed in murine infections by l.  amazonensis, there is always a unique and clearly defined th response present in infections by l.  major   <cit> .

based on these observations, we performed assays designed to understand if all potential epitopes  derived from the cooh-extension of cpb would induce a unique and well-characterized th response or if there would be peptides stimulating simultaneously distinct th responses. our results indicated that the latter hypothesis is true. it is interesting to note that cd8+ t lymphocytes may also present profiles of cytokines expression in a manner similar to cd4+ t lymphocytes  <cit>  and, so, may be the cell type responsible for the production of the cytokines detected in the cell cultures. but none of the tested peptides was able to induce no production in cell cultures of balb/c or cba mice.

this diversity of stimuli by the tested peptides points towards a possible survival strategy of the parasite: by overloading the host immune system with multiple immunomodulatory antigens, the parasite may induce it to elicit a series of inefficient responses and, thus, render it unable to properly control the infection. these inefficient responses would be translated as the mixed th response observed in murine infection by l.  amazonensis  <cit> .

contrary to what would be expected, the cells from cba mice in culture did not produced ifn-Î³ when challenged with the synthetic epitopes. although this fact may seem contradictory at first, because the expression of a th1-related cytokine by a murine strain mildly resistant to l.  amazonensis infection seems logic, a previous review article by alexander & bryson  <cit>  already pointed out that, despite being useful to explain some of the features that lead to disease control/exacerbation in leishmania infections, the th1/th <dig> dichotomy model is oversimplified. thus, other factors, unrelated to these responses, may influence the outcome of infection. so, though we have tried to use the th1/th <dig> dichotomy as a guideline along this study, it was not unexpected to observe results that would not fit into the th1/th <dig> model, as the one indicated.

also, in our study, we noted that stimulation for cytokines production seems to be unrelated to stimulus for proliferation. a possible explanation for this fact may be an inhibition of il- <dig> or its receptor production in lymphocytes by the parasites: such strategy would limit the area of an immune response, allowing for dissemination of the infection. deficiency to produce il- <dig> was previously reported in patients with visceral leishmaniasis  <cit> , while in mice infected by l.  amazonensis such inhibition in the production of this cytokine was not observed  <cit> . further investigation of il- <dig> production and activity in the murine model of leishmania infection is required to clarify this question.

in silico simulations of the interactions between mhc and the predicted epitopes were also performed. these simulations were helpful to indicate some major amino acid residues of the mhc cleft that act on epitope binding. more importantly, they indicated some patterns of mhc/epitope interaction that seem to be related to the stimulus to produce a specific cytokine. further studies with increasing numbers of epitopes that stimulate specific cytokines in experimental murine infection with leishmania are required, but our results provide a preview of a study methodology to understand immunomodulatory effects of this parasite.

we were able to confirm, by the data gathered in this study, the potential of the cooh-terminal extension from l.  amazonensis cpb to influence the outcome of experimental murine infections by interfering, through its derived peptides, with the balance of th cells, as we had previously proposed  <cit> .

taken in conjunction with our previous reports, our present results shed light over another specific aspect of the highly complex and fine-tuned network of interactions that regulates the outcome of leishmania infection in mice. also, we believe that, if applied to the study of other potential immunoregulatory molecules from the parasite, the methodological approach drafted here may be very helpful for a fast definition of epitopes derived from parasites proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the proposed methodology for epitope mapping of leishmania proteins was shown to be very useful. many distinct predicted epitopes from the cooh-terminal extension from l.  amazonesis cpb were able to promote the expression of distinct cytokines in murine cell cultures, thus showing important immunomodulatory properties of this extension.

the use of molecular docking technique to analyze the interaction between peptides and mhc molecules in the murine model of experimental leishmania infection showed evidences of a relation between the capacity of peptides to induce the expression of specific cytokines in the cell cultures and their interaction with key amino acids residues in the mhc cleft.
