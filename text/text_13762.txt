BACKGROUND
sugarcane is an increasingly economically attractive crop, used for the production of approximately 60% of the world's sugar and also of ethanol, a low-carbon emission fuel. sugarcane varieties with improved tolerance to adverse environmental conditions are highly desirable. unfavorable environmental factors are the major culprits of losses in agriculture and can reduce average productivity by 65% to 87% depending on the crop  <cit> . crops better fit to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses have been selected by traditional genetic breeding programs but the slow pace in obtaining plants with the desirable traits limits the development of improved crop varieties. in this scenario, the use of molecular tools that enable gene-targeted modifications to achieve a phenotype of interest is highly promising.

plants react to changes in the environment through an array of cellular responses that are activated by stress stimuli, leading to plant defense and/or adjustment to adverse conditions. physiological changes elicited by external signals can be modulated by transcriptional regulation leading to the induction or repression of target genes. many high throughput studies have been conducted to define gene expression changes in plants submitted to stress  <cit> . such studies showed that signal transduction gene expression is altered in response to stress possibly leading to changes in growth and development and adjustment to environmental conditions. few studies have been conducted to unravel sugarcane's responses to biotic and abiotic stresses or the role of phytohormones in these processes. examples of these are those that evaluated changes in the sugarcane transcriptome induced by cold and methyl jasmonate treatment  <cit> . the aim of this work was to profile sugarcane gene expression under conditions that affect crop yield: drought, phosphate starvation, herbivory and endophytic bacteria interaction. drought is a condition of special interest, not only for sugarcane, but also for other crops, since increasing water scarcity has been observed throughout the world. plant irrigation currently accounts for approximately 65% of global freshwater use indicating that the development of plant varieties resistant to drought will be a necessity in the near future  <cit> . plant responses to drought are complex, partially dependent on aba signaling and dependent on the intensity and duration of the stimulus. the main responses include changes in ion fluxes, stomatal closing, production of osmoprotectants and alteration in plant growth patterns  <cit> .

a significant portion of the arable land in tropical areas presents either limiting concentrations of essential nutrients or toxicity. phosphorous , an essential macronutrient, is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth because of its low solubility and high sorption capacity in soil  <cit> . plant roots acquire p as inorganic phosphate , although the concentration of pi in the soil solution is often low   <cit> . the low availability of pi in the acid soils of tropical and subtropical regions is a major limiting factor for crop production  <cit> . p constitutes around  <dig> % of plants dry weight  <cit>  and plays important roles in several biological processes, such as nucleic acid and phospholipid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, signal transduction and enzyme activity regulation.

insect pests frequently challenge sugarcane productivity. the sugarcane borer diatraea saccharalis is the major sugarcane pest in brazil causing plant death due to apical bud death  in plants of up to four months of age and damage to lateral bud development, aerial rooting, weight loss and stalk breakage in older plants. the attack also allows for infection by opportunistic fungi, which results in production loss for both the sugar and alcohol industries .

the sugarcane culture is highly benefited by the association with n2-fixing endophytic bacteria . unlike rhizobium/leguminosae symbiosis, where bacteria are restricted to nodules, herbaspirillum spp. and g. diazotrophicus are endophytic, and colonize intercellular spaces and vascular tissues of most plant organs without causing damage to the host  <cit> . these bacteria promote plant growth possibly by nitrogen fixation and also by the production of plant hormones  <cit> . despite the non-pathogenic aspects of this interaction, plants should limit bacterial growth inside their tissues, or the association can result in disease  <cit> . little is known about the signaling mechanisms that are involved in the establishment of a beneficial association with the plant.

a study on the response of sugarcane plants to methyl jasmonate  and abscisic acid  treatments is needed since the role of these phytohormones in biotic and abiotic stress responses is well characterized and could point us to the regulatory mechanisms behind the stress treatments of interest. several evidences point to a complex signaling network triggered by the action of aba, including cross-talk with other hormone response pathways  <cit> . moreover, several genes that are induced by aba also have their expression induced by drought and cold stress  <cit> . protein kinases  <cit>  and transcription factors  <cit>  have been shown to mediate the signal transduction network of meja action. all meja actions seem to need a functional coi protein, involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  <cit> . cdna arrays have been used to evaluate changes in gene expression in sugarcane leaves treated with meja  <cit> . two transcriptional factors encoding a putative zinc finger protein, a heat shock factor protein, protein kinases, proteins with a role in secondary metabolism, protein synthesis, stress response and photosynthesis were found to be differentially expressed.

the genes studied in this work were identified by the sucest  project. the sucest project  <cit>  sequenced over  <dig>  ests, which were grouped into over  <dig>  sas   <cit> . the sucast project   <cit>  used blast searches, pfam and smart domain analysis to identify conserved signal transduction components such as receptors, adapters, g-proteins, small gtpases, members of the two-component relay system, nucleotide cyclases, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, elements of the ubiquitination machinery and transcription factors. in addition, sas that might be involved in processes triggered by stress and pathogens or play a role in growth and development were also catalogued. the combined analysis of the sugarcane est data bank, by means of an in depth annotation and gene architecture analysis, generated the sucast catalogue with over  <dig>  members including around  <dig> sas for hormone biosynthesis and around  <dig> sas with no similarities to known proteins, which were selected due to our interest in associating function to new genes. these elements represent 5% of the total sas from the current sucest dataset.

to define the expression pattern of these genes in the various sugarcane tissues cdna microarrays with  <dig>  distinct elements were constructed. a total of  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed when leaf, inflorescence, root, internode and lateral bud tissues were compared  <cit> . for this work, a new array was designed with  <dig>  elements in common with the array used in the previous study  <cit>  plus an additional  <dig> elements including  <dig> representatives of the sugarcane kinome. overall, 50% of the sas catalogued in each sucast category are represented in the array that contains a total of  <dig>  genes.

in the context of plant signal transduction, the role of protein kinases is remarkable. these proteins are responsible for the post-translational control of target proteins, acting as critical regulators of many signaling cascades. moreover, many plant protein kinases act as receptors  and participate in processes like disease resistance, growth, development, hormone perception and stress responses  <cit> . many protein kinases remain uncharacterized, especially those corresponding to rlks. of  <dig>  protein kinases previously catalogued by the sucast project 39% could not be assigned to known categories based on blast searches and were annotated as undefined kinases. this work also reports the categorization of sugarcane protein kinases based on neighbor-joining  trees constructed from the alignment of the predicted catalytic domain. the association of an expression pattern to the categories generated by the phylogenetic analysis is useful in guiding studies on sugarcane kinases and other genes responsive to environmental and hormonal stimuli.

RESULTS
gene expression changes in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli
to identify genes regulated at the expression level by biotic and abiotic factors sugarcane plants were exposed to a variety of conditions that affect yield negatively  or positively . since a role for aba and jasmonates has been observed in the regulation of plant stress responses in other plant systems  <cit> , plants were also exposed to these phytohormones.

to obtain gene expression patterns and identify differentially expressed genes cdna microarrays representing  <dig>  genes were co-hybridized to fluorescently labeled probes generated from control and treated plants. the great majority of the genes were selected from the sucast catalogue  <cit> . some correspond to sugarcane metabolism genes indexed in the sucamet  catalogue. both catalogues can be found at  <cit> . the hybridizations were performed as shown in table  <dig>  cultivar sp80- <dig> was used for the aba, meja, phosphate deficiency and herbivory experiments. cultivar sp90- <dig> was used for drought experiments and sp70- <dig> for the endophytic bacteria interaction experiments. to define differential expression we used the outliers searching method  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed in both biological replicates in at least one of the treatments. of these, twenty-nine were found differentially expressed in two or more treatments. most of these  were responsive both to drought and phytohormones in agreement with the known role of aba and meja in drought responses as discussed in the next section.

additional file 1: table  <dig> lists the differential expression  observed for each sas in each treatment as well as the corresponding sucast categories. all additional files may be found at  <cit> . for reference, the table also includes the tissue expression profile for these genes in flowers, lateral buds, leaves, roots, immature and mature internodes  as published previously  <cit> . the log <dig> ratio  values for the valid elements represented in our array for all experiments are shown in additional file 2: table  <dig> 

drought elicited changes were most apparent in the late experimental data points  as opposed to the first data point : 88% of drought-responsive genes were detected as differentially expressed exclusively after  <dig> h and/or  <dig> h of water deprivation. conversely, the majority  of the genes regulated by phosphate deficiency were detected as differentially expressed in the early data point . for the phytohormone treatments, differential expression was found throughout the experimental time-course.

in addition to the analysis of differential expression using the outliers searching method, the som algorithm  <cit>  was used to cluster the expression data for phytohormone treatments, phosphate starvation and drought. gene expression profiles were compared between the two biological replicates. profiles with a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  or higher were identified for  <dig> genes in response to aba treatment,  <dig> in response to meja treatment,  <dig> for phosphate deficiency and  <dig> for drought. the clusters obtained are partially shown in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the components of the som groups are available as additional files . many of the genes included in a som group showing evident induction or repression patterns were not detected as being differentially expressed according to the outliers searching method. while the outliers searching method is based on criteria that take into account the intensity-dependent effect on the ratio values and data reproducibility, the clustering analysis allows for the visualization of the expression pattern along the entire time course. for this reason, both analysis were taken into account when defining sugarcane genes responsive to these treatments.

the sugarcane kinome
among the differentially expressed genes defined by the outliers search method and the som groups we found  <dig> sas belonging to the sugarcane kinome . since 39% of sucast protein kinases could not be classified based on blast similarities and domain analysis we used a phylogenetic approach based on the analysis of arabidopsis thaliana protein kinases  <cit>  to annotate the sugarcane kinome.

sugarcane protein kinases , rlks  containing a putative pkinase domain and protein kinases from other organisms  were aligned using the neighbor-joining algorithm. the term rlck  was defined by  <cit>  and refers to protein kinases that, in spite of having a catalytic domain very similar to the ones found for rlks, apparently constitute cytoplasmic kinases. as it is known that rlks/rlcks form a monophyletic gene family with respect to other eukaryotic kinase families  <cit>  we opted to first construct a nj tree for sugarcane protein kinases, including only some representatives of the rlks/rlcks category, and then to obtain a nj tree for rlks/rlcks members. a summarized view of the nj trees obtained is depicted in figure  <dig>  a complete view of the neighbor-joining  trees is shown in additional file 8: figure  <dig> and additional file 9: figure  <dig>  six major groups were defined for protein kinases  with group ka comprising the rlks and rlcks representatives. four groups were obtained  for the rlks/rlcks.

we observed that some sas with blast best hits similar to undefined protein kinases and with no predicted transmembrane regions grouped with receptors and rlcks in the phylogenetic analysis. for this reason, we classified these sequences as putative rlcks instead of undefined protein kinases. in fact, some of these sequences may represent novel types of rlcks not yet characterized. on the other hand, some of them may also be receptor-like kinases with incomplete cdnas, lacking the extracellular domain and transmembrane region that would indicate they are receptors.

all sugarcane protein kinases were classified in the sucast database with the prefix cane followed by its annotation and a continuous numeration. each undefined protein kinase or rlk received a new classification, based on the phylogenetic group and family to which it belongs. all families constituted entirely by sugarcane undefined protein kinases, rlks or rlcks, and supported by a bootstrap value superior to 50% received a specific nomenclature, as well as the sas included within these families . with this criterion, it was possible to define  <dig> families constituted entirely by undefined protein kinases and  <dig> families constituted by undefined rlks/rlcks.

the phylogenetic analysis allowed for the classification of  <dig> undefined protein kinases . group kb contains  <dig> of them. thirty-four undefined rlcks and  <dig> undefined rlks were included within the rlks/rlcks tree . group ra contains most of the undefined rlcks  and group rd, the majority of the undefined rlks .

among the  <dig>  sugarcane protein kinases catalogued,  <dig> were represented in our array. additional file 3: table  <dig> shows expression data for all sugarcane protein kinases that were found as differentially expressed based on the outliers searching method  or som analysis .

validation of microarray data by real-time pcr
twenty-two genes were selected to have their expression data validated by quantitative real-time pcr. the primers designed for these genes and the statistical analysis  and pr for up- and down-regulated genes, respectively) of the data are shown in additional file 10: table  <dig>  the expression profile along the whole time-course was analysed by real-time pcr for phytohormone treatment samples. for other treatments, reactions were carried out only for the experimental point in which the gene was detected as being differentially expressed.

as reference genes for normalization we used a polyubiquitin gene for the aba treatment and drought data, a gapdh gene for the meja treatment and herbivory data, a 25s rrna gene for endophytic inoculation and a 14-3- <dig> gene for the phosphate starvation data. the different references were selected for their unaltered expression in each of the treatments. curves  obtained at different experimental points and the respective sas expression profiles in the m × s space for each particular experiment were evaluated. the polyubiquitin and 14-3- <dig> genes were previously used as a reference for the validation of expression levels in different sugarcane tissues  <cit> . the gapdh and 25s rrna genes were described as good references for sugarcane tissues and genotypes  <cit> . the 25s rrna primers used were 25s rrna1f and 25s rrna1r  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> results of differential expression were evaluated . of these,  <dig> % had a profile in real-time pcr assays consistent with the one observed in the microarray experiments . validated real-time pcr results are depicted in figure  <dig>  it is important to emphasize that the rna samples used in the real-time pcr experiments derived from a third biological sample and that the principles of real-time pcr techniques are different from the ones applied in microarray experiments. the conflicting results may correspond to biological variations in the third biological replica or even to technical limitations of the microarray method. nevertheless, our analysis and statistical methods were efficient in evaluating differentially expressed genes, yielding only a minor percentage of unconfirmed expression data.

the sucast database
a database containing all the sas catalogued in the sucast project and their respective expression data was built and is available at the sucest-fun database web site  <cit> . the sucest-fun database includes the expression data associated to stress responses and environmental stimuli and the expression profile of sucast sas in six different sugarcane tissues  <cit> . it also includes the sucamet categories of sugarcane metabolism genes.

the sucast databank integrates the sequence data and analysis from the sucest project  <cit> , the categorization and tissue gene expression of signal transduction genes  <cit>  with the kinome analysis and gene expression data in response to different treatments as pointed out by the outliers searching method, som and quantitative pcr analysis .

the sucast system consists of a client web interface and a server back end. the database was constructed using the mysql database server  <cit> . the scripts were written in perl  <cit>  and r statistical language  <cit> . through the web interface, the sucast database can be easily queried to find each sas and its associated information. for each sas it is possible to retrieve the consensus sequence of the sas and the alignment of its corresponding reads, according to the clusterization of sucest reads  <cit> .

besides expression data, the sucast database also provides, for each sas queried, information regarding annotation, results of the blasts against the genbank nr and the ncbi geo databases and comparisons with the gene ontology database  <cit> . as of the time of submission  <dig>  sas showed similarity against sequences in ncbi geo database . comparison of these sas with the gene ontology database  revealed significant matching with proteins for  <dig>  sas.

over  <dig>  sas are compiled in the sucast database. it is possible to retrieve the predicted protein sequence encoded by the consensus sequence as well as information on conserved protein domains predicted by the pfam  <cit>  databank. the sucast elements are distributed into  <dig> main categories subdivided into  <dig>  subcategories. the database also includes  <dig> sucast sas that present no matches with existing protein sequences in the genbank nr database .

discussion
identification of sugarcane genes responsive to biotic and abiotic stimuli
in an effort to associate gene expression changes to environmental factors that may affect sugarcane yield we profiled the expression of  <dig>  sugarcane genes in response to drought, phosphate deficiency, herbivory and endophytic bacteria. we also analysed the responses of plants to aba and meja treatments. the  <dig>  genes selected are representative of all categories found in the sucast catalogue. the outliers searching method has proved to be a robust way of differential expression analysis that considers the overall dispersion of signal intensity and provides reliable gene expression differences. a complementary approach useful to highlight the patterns observed and to include data points where differential expression was not striking was the selection of patterns highly correlated among biological replicates and their grouping by the som algorithm. this approach increased the number of genes analysed and confirmed the differences observed through the use of the outliers searching method. for instance, there were three histone genes  in som group b <dig> of genes up-regulated by meja. only one of the h <dig> histone genes was detected as being up-regulated by meja exposure  according to the outliers searching method. this exemplifies the usefulness of the som analysis in addition to the outliers analysis of differentially expressed genes, revealing two additional histones induced by meja. probably, the values of log <dig> ratio  for these sas were not enough to surpass the intensity-dependent cutoff levels that indicated differential expression, but the som analysis revealed that these sas apparently were responsive to the meja treatment.

from the  <dig> genes detected as differentially expressed,  <dig> were also included in at least one of the som clustering analysis performed . some had their expression patterns evaluated by real-time pcr along the entire time course of phytohormone treatment  and presented consistent results.

analysis of sugarcane genes responsive to phytohormones and environmental challenges
tissue expression data was obtained for most genes of the array in a previous study where samples extracted from six different sugarcane tissues were hybridized against a common reference sample  <cit> . these studies indicated  <dig> genes differentially expressed in at least one of the tissues tested and  <dig> genes evenly expressed in all tissues. among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes detected in the present study,  <dig> correspond to tissue-enriched genes. most of them  are leaf-enriched, but there were also genes that were expressed preferentially in sugarcane roots  and internodes . while these are interesting observations, it is important to emphasize that they should be considered with caution, since the experiments reported here used plantlets cultivated under growth chamber or greenhouse conditions while in our previous studies most of the samples were collected from 12- or 14-month-old plants cultivated in the field.

water deprivation was the condition that elicited the majority of gene expression changes. fifty-two percent of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were responsive to drought. many studies have reported the identification of genes regulated by drought and altered expression of transcription factors. specific recognition sequences for some categories of transcription factors were detected in the promoter of drought-responsive genes, as is the case of myc and myb recognition sequences and the w-box for wrky transcription factors  <cit> . we observed the induction of one myb and two wrky transcription factors in response to drought .

many of the genes responsive to drought are similar to genes that in other systems have been shown to transduce additional stress signals including cold. the cold and drought signaling pathways present a high degree of overlap and many of the responses are mediated by aba  <cit> . four sas encoding low temperature induced  proteins were up-regulated in response to lack of water. two of these sas  are grouped with genes induced by water deprivation. many genes co-regulated in response to drought and cold in arabidopsis  <cit>  have a dre  motif or dre-related motifs in their promoters. a transcription factor  from the ap <dig> family and homologous to rice dreb <dig>   was induced after  <dig> h of watering suppression and may represent an important transcription factor for the regulation of sugarcane drought responsive genes. the overexpression of a constitutive active form of dreb2a  in arabidopsis thaliana led to the development of transgenic plants more tolerant to drought  <cit> . hence, the manipulation of dreb <dig> levels in sugarcane may represent a way of obtaining new varieties with increased resistance to water deficit. genes induced by aba and drought include two delta- <dig> oleate desaturase , one s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase  and one pp2c-like protein phosphatase  homologous to arabidopsis protein phosphatases abi <dig> and abi <dig>  the protein phosphatases abi <dig> and abi <dig> are responsive to aba and regulate a range of physiological responses, including stomatal closure, which minimizes the transpirational water loss  <cit> . s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases participate in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway, which is modulated in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . sccclr1c05g <dig> g  is homologous to the s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase samdc <dig> , from rice, known to accumulate in response to salinity and drought, probably through aba-dependent pathways and with an expression positively correlated with salt tolerance  <cit> . the regulation of fatty acid desaturases  may be related to changes in the degree of fatty acid desaturation in response to environmental stresses. fad <dig>  fad <dig> and fad <dig> desaturases expression is directly related to drought tolerance. a role of an omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase in drought tolerance was reported in tobacco through overexpression  <cit>  and gene silencing  <cit>  studies. additionally, it was demonstrated that the reduction in trienoic fatty acid levels by the antisense expression of the fad <dig>  gene seems to affect the abf -dependent gene expression showing a relationship between desaturases levels and aba-signaling pathways  <cit> . thus, the regulation of the sugarcane delta- <dig> oleate desaturases by aba and drought may indicate that these genes are induced by drought and that this induction alters aba signaling pathways.

a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were found in plants treated with aba. fifty-eight percent of these are exclusively regulated after  <dig> h of treatment with this hormone, indicating the existence of early and late response genes in the time course of our experiment. among the aba-responsive genes, we could observe the induction of a gene  encoding a glycine-rich protein with a predicted rna recognition motif. the function of this class of proteins is not clear  <cit>  but it is known that some of them play an important role in rna turnover  <cit> . a sorghum bicolor gene  similar to sccclr1c07b <dig> g  was induced by aba treatment, light and salinity  <cit> . the maize ma <dig> protein is also an example of an rna-binding protein induced by aba  <cit> .

several regulators of aba signaling pathways are described and characterized  <cit> . among these, the rop <dig> small gtpase  from the rab family in arabidopsis was implicated in the down-regulation of the aba signal transduction pathway  <cit> . our analysis revealed two gtpases similar to rab <dig>  induced after exposure to this hormone. the osrab <dig> gtpase from rice   <cit>  and the rab <dig> gtpase  from sporobolus stapfianus  <cit>  were also described as regulated by aba. these observations point to an involvement of different rab gtpases in the cellular responses activated by this hormone.

among the genes up-regulated by meja treatment there were two h <dig> histones and one h2b histone genes in som group b <dig>  the h <dig> histone sccclr2002g <dig> g  was also identified as up-regulated after  <dig> h of meja exposure by the outliers searching method. it has been reported that jasmonates may regulate gene expression by interfering with histone acetylation and deacetylation since coi <dig> , an f-box protein required for jasmonates responses was able to target an arabidopsis histone deacetylase to proteolysis  <cit> . furthermore, kim and colleagues  <cit>  observed the induction of histones cah2b  and cah <dig>  from capsicum annuum by meja. the regulation of histone transcript levels in sugarcane points towards chromatin remodeling as a possible event activated by jasmonates which may represent an important mechanism through which jasmonates regulate the expression of target genes.

a comparison of sugarcane and rice  <cit>  aba responsive genes indicates that a fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , a glyoxalase  and a rubisco gene  are induced by aba in both grasses. the sugarcane fructose-bisphosphate aldolase induced by aba is similar to the npaldp <dig>  gene expressed in nicotiana paniculata leaves and repressed in response to saline stress  <cit> . the sugarcane aldolase gene was also regulated by drought and meja treatments  and according to our previous work  <cit>  this sas is enriched in sugarcane leaves. this suggests a potential role of this gene in signaling pathways specific of this organ. another sas encoding an aldolase seems to be slightly induced by aba treatment . the analysis of transcripts levels for genes of the glycolytic and fermentation pathways in rice roots and shoots indicated the induction of an aldolase gene in response to saline stress  <cit> . in another work, an arabidopsis aldolase gene was repressed by aba  <cit> . a wealth of evidence has accumulated throughout the years revealing important interactions between sugar- and phytohormone pathways  <cit> . additionally, aba is implicated in the regulation of sugar transport and metabolism. the regulation of glycolytic enzymes by stressful conditions and the consequences of this regulation are particularly interesting for sugarcane, since these findings may indicate a relationship between sucrose accumulation and responses to stresses.

the identification of differential expression for genes with no homologs in the public databases  as well as of sas coding for unknown proteins is particularly valuable for the identification of their putative roles. we obtained  <dig> "no matches" differentially expressed in at least one of the experiments analysed. of these,  <dig> are regulated by drought,  <dig> by inoculation with herbaspirillum,  <dig> by aba treatment,  <dig> by meja treatment,  <dig> by herbivory and  <dig> by phosphate starvation. four of these are leaf-enriched genes. one of them was induced by both inoculation with n2-fixing endophytic bacteria and exposure to insect attack. this may indicate a possible role for this gene in general mechanisms of defense against biotic stimuli, including endophytic recognition and the activation of defense responses until the establishment of an efficient association. it is also interesting to point out that five of these  <dig> no matches genes do not present a predicted coding region and may represent non-coding transcripts. recent studies have established important roles for some plant micrornas in the regulation of processes like development, response to pathogens and hormone signaling  <cit> . among the sucest sequences,  <dig> non-coding no matches were identified. through the present studies we see an indication that five of them may have a role in stress responses since drought regulated three of them, methyl jasmonate treatment regulated one and inoculation with herbaspirillum spp regulated another.

phosphate starvation altered the expression of  <dig> genes. the majority of them  showed decreased levels after  <dig> hours of starvation. expression data indicates that during this early phase of the stress response an alteration in protein n-glycosylation may occur, as can be inferred from the repression of a gene coding for an n-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase . the decreased expression of two genes coding for thioredoxins  indicates there are changes in the redox state of sugarcane roots in response to phosphate starvation, since these enzymes are important regulators of the intracellular redox status  <cit> . a gene similar to myb transcription factors had transcript levels reduced. several members of this gene family show distinct expression profiles in response to phosphate starvation in arabidopsis, some of them being up-regulated and some down-regulated  <cit> . it is worth to note that the promoter region of the oat homolog of this gene   has been characterized and shown to be active only in the root apex  <cit> . alterations in the expression of root apex enriched genes could be related to the morphological changes observed in the root system in response to low levels of p.

even though the plant-endophytic association is advantageous for both organisms, it is believed that sugarcane plants recognize these microorganisms and activate defense responses until the establishment of an efficient association  <cit> . in agreement with this, four r-genes were found among the genes responsive to the endophytic association. plant disease resistance  genes mediate specific recognition of pathogens via perception of avirulence  gene products  <cit> . two of them were induced by both associations under study . the inoculation with gluconacetobacter also led to the induction of a salicylic acid biosynthesis gene. the phytohormone salicylic acid accumulates in plant tissues in response to pathogen attack and is essential for the induction of systemic acquired resistance and for some responses mediated by resistance genes  <cit> .

a pp2c  was up-regulated in plants inoculated with gluconacetobacter. also, expression of five transcription factors was altered when the plants were cultivated in association with endophytic bacteria. among these, there were two zinc-finger transcription factors , one of which was up-regulated by inoculation with either gluconacetobacter or herbaspirillum. in agreement with our data, a possible role for phosphatases and zinc-finger transcription factors in response to endophytic bacteria has also been pointed out by the in silico analysis of the sucest project libraries, that identified sas corresponding to these categories exclusively or preferentially expressed in the sucest cdna libraries constructed from plants inoculated with gluconacetobacter and herbaspirillum  <cit> .

expression data for the herbivory experiment points to the strong induction of a pathogenesis-related protein similar to a thaumatin after  <dig> h of the onset of this stress. this is not surprising, since it is known that proteins from this category are important for plant defense mechanisms and may present antifungal action, endo-β <dig> -glucanase activity and trypsin or a-amylase inhibitory activity  <cit> . further characterization of this sugarcane thaumatin-like protein should be carried out in order to define its activity and the defense mechanism that this protein may confer against the sugarcane stalk borer.

sugarcane-responsive genes related to hormone biosynthesis and signaling
phytohormone signaling pathways exhibit a wide degree of cross-talk among their components creating a complex network of overlapping signaling  <cit> . interactions among phytohormone signaling pathways are highly complex and the features of these interactions are time and space dependent. although we are only beginning to outline signaling cross-talks in sugarcane, the analysis of the expression profiles of the differentially expressed genes obtained  as well as the groups obtained in the clustering analysis  uncover some aspects of these interactions. auxin signal transduction pathways appear to be activated in response to several of the treatments studied. aba treatment elicited an antagonistic response between the aba and auxin pathways. a gene  coding for a protein similar to the auxin responsive protein gh <dig>  <cit>  was found repressed by aba . furthermore, a gene  coding for a protein with a predicted auxin repressed domain found in dormancy-associated- and auxin-repressed proteins  <cit>  was up-regulated by this hormone . it has been shown that aba and auxin interact antagonistically to regulate stomatal aperture  <cit>  and the interaction between auxin and aba signaling pathways has been demonstrated by the dual specificity of the abi <dig> transcription factor, which is able to bind sequences upstream of aba and auxin responsive genes. in the presence of aba, abi <dig> binds to the gh <dig> like promoter sequences and inhibits the auxin-mediated induction  <cit> .

auxins have been implicated in several aspects of the drought response including proline accumulation  <cit> , rhizogenesis  <cit>  and indole 3-butyric acid increases  <cit> . our data also indicate auxin signaling in response to drought. we observed the induction of genes encoding auxin biosynthesis enzymes  after  <dig> h of water deprivation and the down-regulation of transcription factors from the aux/iaa category after  <dig> h of drought. these transcription factors work by inhibiting auxin signaling and are rapidly induced by auxin exposure  <cit> . however, aux/iaa accumulation is subject to negative feedback, since auxins target aux/iaa for degradation by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . groups d <dig> and d <dig> contain two nitrilases and one auxin-binding protein . additionally, one auxin response factor is induced by drought  and four aux/iaa transcription factors are modulated .

phosphate starvation leads to alterations in root architecture, resulting in increased soil exploration and phosphate acquisition. in this process of morphological adaptation, auxins and other phytohormones play important roles in root elongation and lateral root development  <cit> . lópez-bucio and colleagues  <cit>  showed that phosphate deprivation increases auxin sensitivity in arabidopsis, what may explain the increased number of lateral roots observed when the plant is under nutritional stress. in agreement with this observation, the auxin-repressed protein found in group a <dig>  was repressed after  <dig> h of phosphate starvation. this same sas was also down-regulated by meja treatment what may indicate a possible synergism among meja and auxin pathways. even though the majority of interactions between meja and auxins are antagonistics, there is evidence that these hormones may act synergistically at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . it is hypothesized that, since coi <dig> and tir <dig>  components of scf  complexes associated to jasmonate- and auxin-responses, respectively, are highly similar, these two signaling pathways may converge to the degradation of common target regulatory proteins  <cit> .

phosphate starvation also causes a reduction in the expression of a gene  similar to ble <dig> from rice. rice plants where the gene osble <dig>  was knocked-out showed reduced growth rates  <cit> . the repression of the sugarcane homolog of osble <dig> in the early phase of phosphate starvation could be an effort to restrain metabolism as occurs in arabidopsis in response to low levels of the nutrient  <cit> . another hormone signaling pathway that seems to be altered in response to phosphate starvation is the ethylene response pathway, since a gene for the eil transcription factor  is down-regulated after  <dig> h of starvation. the rice homolog of this protein, oseil <dig> , acts as a positive regulator of the ethylene response and transgenic rice plants overexpressing oseil <dig> exhibit short root, coiled primary root, slightly short shoot phenotype and elevated response to exogenous ethylene  <cit> . the down-regulation of this transcription factor could be related to the changes in root architecture that occur in response to phosphate starvation.

the sugarcane protein kinases and rlks
detailed descriptions of yeast, drosophila, c.elegans and human kinomes are available  <cit>  as well as studies on plant kinases  <cit> . since plant protein kinases and rlks act as critical regulators of many signaling pathways, they represent important targets to modify pathways of interest.

eight protein kinases were differentially expressed in response to plant inoculation with n2-fixing bacteria. three of these are similar to proteins involved in calcium signaling, a calcium-dependent protein kinase  and two calcineurin b-like interacting protein kinases  of the snrk <dig> subgroup of plant kinases  <cit> . some reports have shown the role of calcium-dependent pathways in the processes of symbiosis and nodulation  <cit> . cdpks may participate in pathogen defense signaling pathways, as seen in the tomato defense responses against the fungi cladosporium fulvum  <cit> . we also observed the induction of a sugarcane gene similar to a gsk3/shaggy protein  kinase by endophytic bacteria association. in plants, these kinases are associated to floral development, brassinosteroid signaling pathways and responses to stresses such as wounding and salinity  <cit> . moreover, one pbs1-like protein kinase  had its transcripts increased in response to the association. the arabidopsis pbs <dig>  protein recognizes avirulence factors from pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of this gene in sugarcane inoculated with n2-fixing bacteria suggests a possible role for this protein in the recognition of these microorganisms.

the role of some receptors in the regulation of symbiosis has been described  <cit> . our data indicates the induction of a putative receptor with predicted leucin-rich repeats  in plants inoculated with herbaspirillum that may be regulating such an interaction. recently, a sugarcane receptor   was shown to be repressed in plants associated with endophytic bacteria and the degree of this repression was directly related to the success of the sugarcane-endophytic bacteria association, indicating a participation of this receptor in signal transduction pathways involved in the establishment of plant-endophytic bacteria interaction  <cit> .

we identified ten protein kinases differentially expressed in response to drought. seven of them are similar to the snrk family of proteins. four were induced by this stress . some snrks are recognized players in stress responses. srk2c leads to improved drought tolerance when overexpressed in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . mutagenesis studies on ost <dig> , a kinase whose activity is induced by drought, led to guard-cell specific effects and aba insensitivity  <cit> . other works describing the function of this family of protein kinases in drought responses include a role in stomatal closure  <cit> . furthermore, among the drought responses, the ca2+-dependent sos signaling pathway  has an important role in regulating ion homeostasis  <cit> . since sos <dig>  mutants are hypersensitive to saline stress  <cit>  it will be interesting to complement our studies with a phenotypic evaluation of plants altered for canecipk- <dig>  canecipk- <dig> or canecipk- <dig> genes to confirm a role for these kinases in drought responses.

among the differentially expressed genes, six undefined kinases/rlks  were regulated by drought, inoculation with herbaspirillum spp. and/or phytohormone treatments and  <dig> undefined kinases/rlks were selected for the som clustering analysis. six protein kinases that grouped within the same phylogenetic family in group ke have very similar catalytic domains, with an insertion of around  <dig> aminoacids between subdomains vii and viii, as defined by hanks et al.  <cit> . these proteins are similar to the protein kinase g11a from rice   <cit> . one of these sas  was included in som group a <dig> and two of them , in group d <dig>  with an apparent expression profile of induction by aba or drought, respectively. it may be of interest to evaluate potential targets of these uncharacterized protein kinases and also to investigate if the sequence between subdomains vii and viii plays a role in substrate recognition or catalytic reaction.

it is important to emphasize that our phylogenetic analysis has limitations imposed by the fact we are dealing with an est databank. for example, many putative sugarcane protein kinases were excluded from our analysis since the available sequences do not present most of the pkinase subdomains. even though, the groups obtained are in good agreement with the classes, groups and families of plant protein kinases previously defined by the plantsp database, despite differences in their classification methodology  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, the expression of  <dig>  sugarcane sas  was evaluated by cdna microarrays in plants submitted to a variety of challenges: drought, phosphate starvation, herbivory by diatraea saccharalis and endophytic bacteria inoculation . additionally, plants were treated with the phytohormones aba and meja, important players in the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.

to our knowledge, this is the first broad evaluation of sugarcane gene expression in response to biotic, abiotic and hormone inputs. since aba and meja play main roles in plant responses to a plethora of stimuli the analysis of genes regulated by these hormones is helpful in deciphering sugarcane defense pathways activated in response to stresses. many of the differentially expressed genes belong to protein families described in the literature as associated to some of the processes studied, indicating that sugarcane responses are similar to those of other well-known plants, such as rice, maize and arabidopsis. additionally, functions were associated to genes poorly studied or novel genes such as genes with no hits in the public databases, genes encoding unknown proteins and undefined kinases/rlks. the information generated by the protein kinase categorization using a phylogenetic approach, associated to the expression data obtained from microarray experiments, represents a useful tool in guiding the future characterization of these proteins.

understanding the molecular mechanisms behind sugarcane stress responses will be useful for the improvement of sugarcane yield by genetic manipulation. this knowledge, allied to the use of genetic engineering, will potentially enable the development of sugarcane varieties tolerant to adverse conditions, such as drought and nutritional deficiency. furthermore, the genes may be explored as molecular markers in traditional breeding programs or have their promoters cloned to accomplish transgene expression activated solely by a specific stimulus. it is important to emphasize the limitations intrinsic to the nature of the data presented. first, changes in mrna levels do not always correlate to protein levels. second, in the field, plants are exposed to a diversity of stressful conditions and the responses achieved by this combination of stimuli probably are not the same as the ones triggered by each individual stimulus. nonetheless, the data generated in controlled experiments certainly represent an important step in the exploration of specific responses. the data also points candidates for gene silencing or overexpression experiments that may corroborate the hypothesis raised. with this in mind an expression panel is currently being constructed for several additional sugarcane cultivars tolerant or more susceptible to the stimuli that certainly will be valuable in guiding the selection of target genes. it will be important to expand the present studies to additional genotypes also if one wishes to compare the responses elicited by the different stimuli. the data obtained may reflect cultivar specific responses in the case of drought and endophytic bacteria interaction, since different cultivars were used in these experiments. the extent of genotypic variation among commercial cultivars is currently unknown. evaluation of sugarcane responses in additional genotypes is underway to further validate commonly regulated pathways.

a databank was created that provides public access to the data described in this work, associated to tissue expression profiling and the sucast gene categories. as the sucast project is an ongoing effort that aims to identify sugarcane signaling components and define their role in grasses, the database is expected to be updated each time new expression data from experiments with the sucast arrays are available. we expect the sucast database to become a useful tool for sugarcane transcriptome data mining and in guiding the selection of target genes to be modified in sugarcane and other grasses.
