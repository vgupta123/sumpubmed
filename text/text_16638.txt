BACKGROUND
drought is a major environmental stress factor worldwide that affects plant growth and development. under drought stress, a series of protective mechanisms are triggered that allow plants to adapt to adverse conditions  <cit> . phytohormones and second-messenger molecules participate in signal transduction to respond to stress by inducing expression of both protein-coding and non-protein-coding genes to produce regulatory molecules, effector molecules directly involved in the biochemical response, and products of non-protein coding genes that regulate expression of other genes at the transcriptional and translational levels  <cit> .

as non-protein-coding gene products, micrornas , ranging in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, regulate gene expression either through post-transcriptional degradation or translational repression of their target mrnas. in plants, most mirnas have perfect or near-perfect complementarity to their mrna targets and downregulate them by targeted cleavage or translational repression  <cit> . functional analyses have demonstrated that mirnas are involved in a variety of developmental processes in plants  <cit> . for instance, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> show abundant expression in young wheat seedlings  <cit> . recently,  <dig> wheat novel mirnas are characterized in a genome-wide level and further identified  <dig> mirnas preferentially expressing in developing or germinating grains, which could play important roles in grain development  <cit> . in addition, mirnas play critical roles in plant resistance to various abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . for example, in the thermosensitive genic male sterile  lines of wheat, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir444c. <dig> are found to respond to cold stress. interestingly, mir <dig> play roles in regulating the auxin-signaling pathway and possibly in the developmental response to cold stress  <cit> . similarly, the expression levels of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir167a, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been shown to be altered in wheat under uv-b stress  <cit> . besides, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are up-regulated in wheat both under powdery mildew infection and heat stress, whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> exhibit opposite expression pattern response to these stresses  <cit> .

mirna expression profiling after drought stress has been performed in wild emmer wheat, rice, arabidopsis and populus. previously, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> have been found to be induced by drought in wild emmer wheat   <cit> . similarly, mir169g is strongly induced while mir <dig> is transiently upregulated in rice by drought stress  <cit> . several mirnas  are found to be downregulated and  <dig> mirnas  are revealed to be induced by drought stress in rice  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are shown to be drought responsive  <cit> . in populus, mir171l-n, mir <dig>  mir1446a-e, and mir <dig> also have been proved to respond to drought stress  <cit> .

although numerous mirnas have been identified in many plant species, only  <dig> sequences have been reported for wheat in the mirbase registry . furthermore, how mirnas confer different levels of dehydration stress tolerance in various wheat genotypes is unclear. to gain insight into the role of wheat mirnas in dehydration stress tolerance, two representative wheat genotypes were used in this study: hanxuan <dig>  a drought-tolerant cultivar grown widely in dry land wheat regions of north china; and zhengyin <dig>  which is drought-susceptible and often planted in water- and fertilizer-rich regions. we grew these two genotypes under well-watered and dehydration-stress conditions and analyzed mirna expression patterns to identify those mirnas involved in dehydration stress tolerance.

RESULTS
effects of dehydration stress on phenotypic alteration to two wheat genotypes
the two wheat genotypes exhibited morphological differences after 12-h dehydration stress treatment. while the hanxuan  <dig> plants  continued to grow relatively well, the plants of zhengyin  <dig>  displayed severe dehydration stress symptoms, such as wilting leaves . in addition, the chlorophyll content of t <dig> and t <dig> decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % than that of c <dig> and c <dig>  and relative water content of t <dig> and t <dig> decreased by  <dig> % and  <dig> % after dehydration stress, respectively .figure  <dig>

the growth and development of lateral roots showed obvious differences in two wheat genotypes after dehydration treatment . for example, the total lengths of lateral roots of c <dig>  t <dig>  c <dig> and t <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm after 12h dehydration stress, respectively . by stress time increasing, the total lengths of lateral roots of t <dig> and t <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm after 72h dehydration stress, whereas the total length of lateral root were  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm in their corresponding control . compared with the total lengths after 12h stress, the total lengths of lateral roots of c <dig>  t <dig> and c <dig> increased respectively by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm, but t <dig> only increased by  <dig>  cm. moreover, numbers of lateral roots were also changed by dehydration stress. for instance, numbers of lateral roots of t <dig> decreased by  <dig>  than c <dig> after 12h dehydration stress, but t <dig> only decreased by  <dig>  than c <dig> . these results suggested that dehydration stress significantly inhibited lateral roots growth and development of the drought-susceptible cultivar, but had a lesser effect on the drought-tolerant cultivar.table  <dig>

we found that the number of leaf vascular tissue cells in two wheat genotypes showed distinct differences after 12h dehydration stress . for instance, xylem and phloem cells of t <dig> leaves were increased averagely by  <dig>  and  <dig>  compare with c <dig> after dehydration treatment, respectively. however, xylem and phloem cells of t <dig> were decreased by  <dig>  and  <dig>  compared to c <dig> after dehydration stress, respectively . these results implied that dehydration stress suppressed dramatically differentiation of vascular tissue cells of leaves of the drought-susceptible cultivar, but differentiation was promoted in the drought-tolerant cultivar.table  <dig>

sequencing and annotation of wheat mirnas
solexa sequencing of mirna libraries generated from well-watered  and dehydration-stressed  hanxuan <dig> and well-watered  and dehydration-stressed zhengyin <dig>  plants yielded  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unfiltered sequence reads, respectively. after discarding low-quality reads, a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  reads were retained. these sequences represented  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unique clean reads for c <dig>  t <dig>  c <dig>  and t <dig>  respectively . the most abundant classes of these unique clean reads were 21– <dig> nucleotides , and the  <dig> nucleotides  sequences were the most common . the unique reads were compared sequentially with the rfam and mirbase databases to annotate  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> unique small rnas  and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unique mirnas for c <dig>  t <dig>  c <dig>  and t <dig>  respectively .table  <dig>

comparison of differentially expressed mirnas between two wheat genotypes
we compared the frequencies of occurrence of differentially expressed mirnas in well-watered and dehydration-stressed plants based on a poisson distribution approach  <cit> . we identified  <dig> conserved mirnas from hanxuan <dig> and  <dig> conserved mirnas from zhengyin <dig> that were differentially expressed between well-watered and dehydration-stressed treatment . we focused on those mirnas common to hanxuan <dig> and zhengyin <dig> and compared their expression levels after dehydration treatment. we used the following criteria as the basis for comparison: a log <dig> ratio of normalized values between the dehydration stress and control treatments greater than  <dig> or less than − <dig> in one of the two genotypes. we identified  <dig> mirnas in common between the two wheat genotypes that were differentially expressed in response to the dehydration treatment . through comparative analysis, we observed that  <dig> mirnas showed upregulation in both genotypes after dehydration stress , while another  <dig> mirnas were downregulated . the expression of  <dig> mirnas exhibited opposite patterns in the two wheat genotypes ; these mirnas were downregulated in hanxuan <dig> but upregulated in zhengyin <dig>  in addition,  <dig> mirnas were expressed predominantly in only one or the other of the two genotypes after dehydration-stress treatment .table  <dig>

in addition,to identify the novel mirnas, criteria for annotation of plant mirnas  <cit>  were used in our study. finally,  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted based on the hexaploid wheat genome . according to the screening criteria of differentially expressed mirnas, we found that  <dig> novel mirnas were differentially expressed in two wheat genotypes after dehydration stress . among them,  <dig> mirnas showed upregulation in both genotypes after dehydration stress, while another  <dig> mirnas were downregulated. moreover,  <dig> mirnas were expressed predominantly in only one of the two wheat genotypes after dehydration stress .

validation of differentially expressed mirnas
to confirm the results of the deep sequencing and comparative analyses, we verified the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas selected randomly by qpcr. the qpcr results coincided with those of the deep sequencing . for example, mir160a, mir164b, mir166h, mir169d, and mir444d. <dig> were confirmed by both techniques to be downregulated in the drought-tolerant hanxuan <dig> after dehydration stress but upregulated in the drought-susceptible zhengyin <dig> . similarly, mir156k, mir444c. <dig> and wheat-mir- <dig>  were shown by both methods to be upregulated in both wheat genotypes after dehydration stress , mir <dig> and wheat-mir- <dig>  were expressed predominantly in only one of the two genotypes . northern blot was also performed to study the transcripts of mirnas of four different expression patterns to confirm the expression profiles obtained from deep sequencing . the results showed that expression of these mirnas in different treatments was also consistent with the result of high-throughput sequencing. these results indicated that the frequency of occurrence in the solexa runs produced a reliable prediction of expression patterns.figure  <dig>

prediction and validation of mirna functions and their effects on potential targets
we predicted  <dig> target genes for the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas . these potential targets were assigned based on gene ontology. with respect to molecular function, the targets fell largely into  <dig> categories, with the three most over-represented being dna binding, atp binding, and protein binding. twelve biological processes were identified, with the three most frequent being metabolic process, response to stress, and regulation of transcription . furthermore, monitoring the expression levels of  <dig> representative target genes by qpcr analysis revealed negative correlations with the levels of their corresponding mirnas . these results implied that several mirnas may be directly or indirectly involved in wheat tolerance to dehydration stress through regulation of target gene expression.figure  <dig>

discussion
recent studies have indicated that the expression of mirnas, an important class of gene regulators, is altered by abiotic stress treatment  <cit> . however, most of these studies were performed using model organisms such as arabidopsis and rice. in this work, we investigated changes in mirna expression levels after dehydration stress in two wheat genotypes to better understand the function of plant mirnas in stress adaptation.

in this study, we identified  <dig> upregulated conserved mirnas and  <dig> conserved downregulated mirnas  in two wheat genotypes subjected to dehydration stress. the gene target of the upregulated mir156k encodes the squamosa promoter-binding-like protein  transcription factor, which is known to be important for leaf growth and development  <cit> . the target of the upregulated mir444c. <dig> is the mikc-type mads-box transcription factor  gene, which was reported to be involved in regulating plant developmental processes and stress responses  <cit> . for the downregulated mir159a, the gene target encodes the myb <dig> transcription factor, which plays a role in cold-stress responses  <cit> . myb family members have also been implicated in plant tolerance to environmental stress through their functions in hormone and other abiotic stress signaling networks  <cit> . our findings indicate that these mirnas may also play important roles in stress tolerance in wheat.

genotypic specificity of mirna expression has been reported previously in terms of the differential expression of a given mirna in the same tissues in different genotypes  <cit> . in this study, we found that  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were expressed predominantly in only one or the other genotype after dehydration treatment . for example, mir <dig> was upregulated in the drought-susceptible cultivar after dehydration treatment . this mirna has been reported to be upregulated in response to copper deprivation  <cit>  and its target gene, superoxide dismutase, is induced during oxidative stress  <cit> . we also showed that wheat-mir- <dig>  was downregulated only in the drought-susceptible cultivar  and its putative gene target was alpha/beta fold hydrolase . most hydrolases are believed to be involved in the decomposition of products of damage  caused by stress conditions  <cit> . moreover, afhs may have diverse functions and play various roles in different pathways despite their sequence similarities. in some cases, they may function as enzymes such as proteases, esterases, or peroxidases  <cit> . our findings suggest that the different expression patterns of wheat-mir- <dig> among wheat genotypes may be related to variations in the capacity to adapt to dehydration stress.

a different expression pattern was exhibited by  <dig> mirnas that were downregulated in the drought-tolerant cultivar, but were upregulated in the drought-susceptible cultivar including mir160a, mir164b, mir166h, mir169d, and mir444d. <dig> . the putative target of mir160a is a member of the auxin response factors  gene family. arfs are key factors in the regulation of physiological and morphological mechanisms mediated by auxins that may contribute to stress adaptation  <cit> . furthermore, arfs regulate the expression of early auxin responsive genes, including the aux/iaa genes  <cit> , and aux/iaa proteins interact with arfs and repress their activities  <cit> . auxin induces targeted ubiquitination/degradation of specific aux/iaa proteins  <cit>  and frees arfs from repression by aux/iaa proteins. the accumulation of arfs resulting from the downregulation of mir160a might enhance the auxin response and thus enhance root and leaf development. the target of mir164b is the nac transcription factor  family. nac tfs have functions related to various abiotic stress  <cit> ; indeed, overexpression of the snac <dig> gene in rice increased drought and salt tolerance  <cit> . in arabidopsis, nac <dig> overexpressing lines were bigger, with larger leaves, thicker stems and more abundant roots than their control plants. the nac <dig> might be an early auxin responsive gene, and confirmed that nac <dig> was located downstream of tir <dig> and upstream of air <dig> and dbp in transmitting the auxin signal to the air <dig> gene to promote lateral root’s development. tir <dig> is likely to regulate nac <dig> at the transcriptional level, perhaps through auxin-dependent degradation of a negative regulator of nac <dig>  <cit> . the downregulation of nac <dig> transcripts by either auxin-induced mir <dig> or ubiquitination may decrease auxin signals  <cit> . in this study, we observed that the lateral roots flourished more in drought-tolerant cultivar than in drought-susceptible cultivar ; this might have resulted from the early accumulation of auxin responsive factors. in the early stage of dehydration stress, the drought-tolerant cultivar might change their morphological characteristics to enhance root and leaf development, thus accumulating more biomass to counteract the wastage brought on by dehydration stress.

mir166h is a member of the mir <dig> family and targets the class iii hd-zip protein  <dig>  gene. in maize, mir <dig> family mirnas cleave rolled leaf <dig>  mrna which alters leaf polarity  <cit> . in addition to their involvement in leaf polarity regulation, hd-zip family members have been reported to be induced by various stress conditions, including drought and phytohormones  <cit> . overexpression of the sunflower hahb- <dig> gene  in arabidopsis conferred both drought-resistance and morphological changes  <cit> . the class iii hd-zip gene athb <dig> is expressed in procambial tissues and has been functionally implicated in vascular tissue formation  <cit> . the class iii hd-zip proteins have also been reported to control cambium activity by promoting axial cell elongation and xylem differentiation  <cit> . in this study, we found that the xylem and phloem cells of leaf are more in drought-tolerant cultivar than in drought-susceptible cultivar after dehydration treatment ; this might have resulted from the upregulation of class iii hd-zip gene. in the course of dehydration stress, the drought-tolerant cultivar might regulate differentiation of vascular tissue cells, thus enhancing the developmental process to adapt dehydration stress.

another mirna, mir169d, is a member of the mir <dig> family and targets the ccaat-box transcription factor , which is one of the most common elements in eukaryotic promoters. the nuclear factor y  transcription factor complex was isolated as a ccaat-binding protein complex and is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that occurs in a wide range of organisms, from yeast to human  <cit> . a study in triticum aestivum revealed that nine subunits of the nfy complex were responsive to drought  <cit> . in arabidopsis, transcription induced by drought and aba was regulated by one nfy transcription factor , which might promote drought resistance  <cit> . in this study, mir169d was repressed in the drought-tolerant cultivar after dehydration stress, which might influence aba-responsive transcription and result in enhanced dehydration stress tolerance.

the putative target of mir444d. <dig> is encoding a translation initiation factor  <dig>  gene. in eukaryotic protein synthesis, translational initiation is considered to be the rate-limiting step and controls transcript stability. if <dig> plays a central role in polypeptide chain elongation in eukaryotes and its expression is induced by environmental stress  <cit> . active conservation of polysomes during desiccation has been reported to be one of the mechanisms associated with stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . we found that mir444d. <dig> was downregulated in the drought-tolerant cultivar, indicating that if <dig> may also involve in dehydration stress tolerance in wheat.

we observed that growth of the drought-tolerant cultivar was better than that of the drought-susceptible cultivar after dehydration stress . given the high similarity in the genetic composition of the two genotypes, phenotypic variations—such as dehydration stress tolerance—are more likely to be caused by changes in regulatory processes than changes in proteins  <cit> . because of their different geographical origins, the two genotypes are adapted to the particular environmental conditions in their native habitats. thus, constitutive differences related to metabolism, biomass mobilization, energetic resources, radical system structure, and density of stomata would be expected. in this study, we confirmed that several mirnas were downregulated in the drought-tolerant cultivar but upregulated in the drought-susceptible cultivar under dehydration stress, and we assessed the functions of their potential targets in response to stress. therefore, we infer that the different capacities for dehydration stress tolerance in the two wheat genotypes may arise from the differential expression of target genes, which are regulated by their corresponding mirnas .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
we found that  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were differentially expressed in two wheat genotypes under dehydration stress. interestingly,  <dig> mirnas exhibited opposite patterns of expression in the two wheat genotypes; these mirnas were downregulated in drought-tolerant cultivar but upregulated in drought-susceptible cultivar. a number of representative mirnas were verified by qpcr analysis and northern blot, which produced results consistent with those of the deep-sequencing method. our findings indicate that expression patterns of some mirnas may be very different even between two genotypes of the same species. further analysis of the targets of differentially expressed mirnas will help understand the mechanism of response and tolerance to dehydration stress in wheat.
