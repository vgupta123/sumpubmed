BACKGROUND
transforming growth factor-β  elicits its cellular effects through activation of type i and type ii serine/threonine kinase receptors  <cit> . the constitutively active type ii receptor phosphorylates specific serine and threonine residues in the juxtamembrane region  of the type i receptor. type i receptor acts downstream of type ii receptor  and has been shown to determine signaling specificity within the heteromeric receptor complex. in most cell types, tgf-β signals via tgf-β type i receptor , also termed activin receptor-like kinase  <dig> . in endothelial cells , however, tgf-β can signal via tβ r-ii and two different type i receptors, i.e. the broadly expressed alk <dig> and the ec-restricted alk <dig>  whereas alk <dig> inhibits ec migration and proliferation, alk <dig> stimulates both these processes  <cit> . the activated type i receptor propagates the signal through phosphorylation of specific receptor-regulated smads . whereas alk <dig> induces the phosphorylation of smad <dig> and smad <dig>  alk <dig> mediates the activation of smad <dig> and smad <dig>  <cit> . activated r-smads can assemble into heteromeric complexes with common partner  smad, i.e. smad <dig> and translocate into the nucleus where they regulate the transcription of target genes  <cit> .

i-smads  are natural inhibitors of tgf-β signaling that prevent the activation of r- and co-smads  <cit> . they do so by interacting efficiently with the activated type i receptors preventing access and phosphorylation of r-smads by the activated type i receptors. smad <dig> has also been found to exert its inhibitory effect on signaling by competing with smad <dig> for heteromeric complex formation with activated smad <dig>  <cit>  and by recruiting the co-repressor ctbp and thereby repress transcription  <cit> . i-smads were found to interact with smad ubiquitination-related factors, smurfs, which are hect-domain ubiquitin ligases that target the tgf-β receptors for degradation  <cit> . the expression of i-smads is quickly induced upon stimulation by members of the tgf-β family and upon shear stress of the endothelium  <cit> . thus, i-smads may be part of negative feedback control mechanisms.

a key event in tgf-β signaling is serine phosphorylation of tβ r-i by tβ r-ii, and of r-smads by tβ r-i. these phosphorylations are tightly controlled, e.g. the immunophilin fkbp- <dig> binds to tβ r-i and thereby inhibits phosphorylation of tβ r-i by tβ r-ii  <cit> . c-terminal phosphorylation of smad <dig> and smad <dig> is strongly facilitated by smad anchor for receptor activation  <cit> .

serine/threonine protein phosphatases  are likely involved in the dephosphorylation of these phosphorylated signaling components. pps consist of a catalytic subunit that binds to one or two regulatory subunits that generate holoenzymes with unique localizations and specificities  <cit> . one of the major pps is pp <dig> consisting of a pp <dig> catalytic subunit  that can form complexes with more than  <dig> regulatory subunits  <cit> . four mammalian isoforms of the pp1c gene have thus far been described, i.e. pp1α, pp1β and two splice variants of pp1γ. studies in drosophila melanogaster suggest that pp <dig> binds to the decapentaplegic  type i receptor with the aid of sara and negatively regulates dpp signaling  <cit> . very recently, it was reported that the tgf-β- induced smad <dig> can interact with the growth arrest and dna damage protein  <dig>  , which is a regulatory subunit of pp <dig>  the smad7- gadd <dig> complex was shown to recruit pp1c to tβ r-i, and thereby dephosphorylate and inactivate it  <cit> .

in the present report, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie the tgf-β-induced transient alk1-mediated smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation versus sustained alk5-mediated smad <dig> phosphorylation in ecs. analysis of the effect of various chemical inhibitors on the tgf-β/alk <dig> response, suggested an important contribution of pp <dig> in the negative regulation of alk <dig> signaling, but not alk <dig> signaling in ecs. our data suggest that smad <dig>  induced by alk <dig> activation, recruits pp1α to alk <dig> and thereby inhibits tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs.

RESULTS
negative regulation of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation is dependent on protein synthesis in ecs
recently we showed that upon tgf-β stimulation in primary ecs, smad <dig> phosphorylation is stable for at least  <dig> hours whereas smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation is transient and absent  <dig> h after stimulation  <cit> . in order to find out if this short duration of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> activation is dependent on induction of newly synthesized proteins, we treated bovine aortic endothelial cells  with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cyclohexamide, and examined the kinetics of smad phosphorylation after tgf-β stimulation. in the non-treated cells, smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation reached peak levels after  <dig> min of tgf-β stimulation and declined thereafter until no phosphorylation was detected after  <dig> h . compared to control cells, the tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in cyclohexamide-treated cells was more sustained and lasted at least  <dig> h . total smad levels were not found to be significantly affected upon cycloheximide treatment during the course of the experiment. similar results were obtained in another type of ecs, the mouse embryonic ecs  . these results suggest that the tgf-β induced smad1/ <dig> signaling is inhibited by newly synthesized inhibitory proteins.

signal strength of tgf-β/alk <dig> pathway in ecs is critically dependent on alk <dig> and smad <dig> expression levels
previously, we showed that tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation is dependent on alk <dig>  treatment of ecs with alk <dig> antisense oligonucleotides specifically inhibited tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . to examine whether intensity and/or duration of signaling is affected by alk <dig> and/or smad <dig> levels, we initially infected baecs with adenoviral constructs of wtalk <dig> or lacz and analysed tgf-β/smad phosphorylation. as shown in figure 2a, whereas smad1/ <dig> phosporylation had returned to background levels after  <dig> min of tgf-β stimulation in lacz infected cells, in cells infected with wild-type  alk <dig> adenoviral construct tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation lasted until  <dig> h.

we strengthened these data by making use of the bre-luc reporter, which can be used as a transcriptional read-out for tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling  <cit> . tgf-β induction of the bre-luc reporter was potentiated upon alk <dig> and/or smad <dig> co-transfection  and attenuated upon sirna-mediated knockdown of alk <dig>  or smad <dig> . inhibition of tgf-β-induced activation of bre-luc reporter by sirna-alk <dig> could be rescued by cotransfection of human alk <dig> or smad <dig>  respectively . taken together, these results demonstrate that tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> activation is critically dependent on the alk <dig> and smad <dig> expression level in ecs.

smad <dig> is induced upon tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling in ecs
the inhibitory smad <dig> is known to be upregulated by tgf-β  <cit> . our data imply that the negative regulation of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> signaling needs newly synthesized protein to become effective and smad <dig> may thus possibly mediate this effect. we therefore examined smad <dig> expression levels in ecs by semi-quantitative rt-pcr upon infection of adenovirus expressing constitutively active alk <dig>  caalk <dig>  or noninfected cells that were stimulated with tgf-β. fig. 3a shows that smad <dig> mrna was upregulated upon stimulation of cells with caalk <dig> and tgf-β , and peaked at  <dig> min to  <dig> hour of tgf-β stimulation . this bell-shaped dose-response curve is consistent with a previous observation that tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation is most prominent at  <dig> – <dig> ng/ml with higher doses of tgf-β having less smad1/ <dig> activation  <cit> . notably, caalk <dig> did not induce smad <dig> expression.

smad <dig> is a highly efficient negative regulator of tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling in ecs
next, we investigated whether overexpression of smad <dig> affects tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling. the cells were infected with adenovirus expressing either lacz or flag-smad <dig> at the moi of  <dig> and the effect on smad phosphorylation was analysed after subjecting the cells to different concentrations of tgf-β. smad <dig> overexpression blocked both smad1/ <dig> and smad <dig> phosphorylation . interestingly, if cells were infected with f-smad <dig> at a moi of  <dig>  resulting in cells with lower levels of ectopically expressed smad <dig> protein, the alk1/smad1/ <dig> pathway but not the alk5/smad <dig> pathway was inhibited . we also examined whether smad <dig> can inhibit smad-mediated transcriptional responses in ecs. smad <dig> inhibited tgf-β/alk1-induced bre-luc activity in a dose dependent manner . tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was also examined when endogenous smad <dig> expression was specifically inhibited. this was done by stable transfection in meec with sirna-smad <dig> plasmid including a hygromycin cassette. tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was found to be prolonged in meecs stably transfected with sirna-smad <dig> compared to control  cells . consistent with this finding, upon sirna-mediated knockdown of smad <dig>  tgf-β-induced bre-luc reporter activation was significantly enhanced. sirna-mediated knockdown of smad <dig> moderately inhibited tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling using 12-luc as read-out . the latter effect is likely indirectly caused by increased tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling that antagonizes alk <dig> signaling  <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that smad <dig> is enhanced by tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling and that it is highly effective in inhibiting the same pathway.

inhibition of proteasome and protein phosphatase activity prolongs the tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs
to examine the involvement of the proteasome pathway in negative regulation of tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling we treated baecs with the proteasome inhibitor mg- <dig>  and observed that smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was stronger and prolonged compared to the non-treated cells . interestingly, when we treated baecs with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin, smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was sustained . we also treated the baecs with the phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate for  <dig> min. tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation was stronger and prolonged compared to non-treated cells . orthovanadate is frequently used as a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, but certain pps, such as the pp <dig> serine/threonine phosphatase, are also potently inhibited by orthovanadate  <cit> . these findings suggest that proteasome degradation and dephosphorylation by pps play prominent roles in inhibiting the activation of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation. as the involvement of proteasome pathway, but not pps, had been intensely investigated in tgf-β signaling, we focused our subsequent studies on the involvement of pps in tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling.

pp1α, which is transcriptionally induced by alk <dig> activation, negatively regulates alk <dig> signaling in ecs
based upon our results implicating pps in the negative regulation of tgf-β-induced alk1/smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation in ecs and a previous report about the involvement of pp <dig> in dephosphorylation of the dpp type i receptor  <cit> , we decided to look further into the connection of pp <dig> in tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling. pp <dig> isoforms were expressed at the mrna level in meecs using specific sets of primers . the effect of alk <dig> or alk <dig> activation on pp <dig> expression was investigated. figure 4a demonstrates that only pp1α is strongly upregulated in meecs expressing caalk <dig>  pp1α mrna was found to be upregulated upon caalk <dig> expression. subsequently, we analysed the effect of tgf-β on p1α expression in time ; pp1α was already upregulated after  <dig> minutes of tgf-β stimulation. analysis of id <dig>  a direct target gene of alk <dig> signaling, was taken along as a control. these data suggest that like smad <dig>  pp1α is a direct alk <dig> target. however, analysis of the effect of tgf-β on pp1α protein expression did not reveal any upregulation . the significance of pp1α in negative regulation of tgf-β-induced smad1/ <dig> activation was shown by sirna-mediated knockdown studies of pp1α . tgf-β/alk1-induced transcriptional activity downstream of the bre-luc reporter was greatly enhanced upon specific inhibition of pp1α expression . basal pp <dig> levels  are not sufficiently high for tgf-β/smad1/ <dig> signaling not to initially proceed. conversely, transcriptional activity downstream of alk <dig> was not affected by pp1α knockdown . the latter is consistent with our finding that tgf-β/alk <dig> -induced smad <dig> phosphorylation  is sustained in ecs.

pp1α binds strongly to alk <dig> in the presence of smad <dig> and dephosphorylates the alk <dig> kinase
subsequently, we examined whether pp1α could interact with alk <dig>  we co-expressed wild-type  alk1/ha and egfp-pp1α with or without flag-smad <dig> in cos- <dig> cells. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for wtalk1/ha followed by immunoblotting for pp <dig> . pp1α was found to interact with alk <dig>  and smad <dig> further enhanced this interaction. consistent with these results, 125i-tgf-β cross-linked to alk <dig> was co-immunoprecipitated with egfp-pp1α when alk <dig> and egfp-pp1α were ectopically expressed in 293t cells . next, we analysed if endogenous pp <dig> affected the phosphorylation of alk <dig>  meecs were adenovirally infected with caalk1/ha and the whole lysate was immunoprecipitated with ha antibodies. the samples were washed and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay followed by a phosphatase assay in the absence or presence of a specific pp <dig> inhibitor, inhibitor- <dig> . as shown in figure 5b, alk <dig> was phosphorylated in the presence of i- <dig>  whereas no alk <dig> phosphorylation was evident in the absence of i- <dig>  taken together, these results indicate that pp1α interacts with and dephosphorylates alk <dig> 

discussion
in the present study we have investigated the molecular mechanisms that underlie the transient smad1/ <dig> activation by tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling versus the sustained tgf-β/alk5-induced smad <dig> activation in ecs  <cit> . our results support a model in which the inhibitory smad <dig> is specifically induced by the tgf-β/alk <dig> pathway and participates in a negative feedback loop in ecs. a rate equation model for the tgf-β/smad pathway in ecs showed that smad <dig> feedback loop provides robustness to the system  <cit> . smad <dig>  previously shown to be capable of interacting with type i receptors  <cit> , may recruit pp1α to alk <dig>  the serine phosphatase activity of pp1α mediates dephosphorylation and inactivation of alk <dig> 

duration of tgf-β/smad signaling is a critical determinant for regulating specificity of cellular biological responses  <cit> . during xenopus embryogenesis differences in the duration of smad signaling is carefully controlled since it is important for cell fate decisions  <cit> . whereas epithelial cells with a sustained smad response are arrested in growth by tgf-β, pancreatic tumors that demonstrate a transient tgf-β/smad response have specifically evaded anti-proliferative effects of tgf-β, while maintaining other tgf-β responses  <cit> . tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling promotes the activation states of ecs. a transient versus sustained alk <dig> response, as determined by smad <dig> and pp1α expression levels, could be of critical importance for angiogenesis. after ecs receive a tgf-β/alk <dig> signal and start to proliferate, migrate and form sprouts, this signal must be turned off, whereafter the tgf-β/alk <dig> signal dominates and the maturation of vessels is induced. interestingly, pp <dig>  activity was previously shown to be needed to maintain ecs in a resting state  <cit> ; inhibition of pp1c activity promoted ec migration consistent with a negative role for this phosphatase in tgf-β/alk1-induced activation of ecs.

here we show that in ecs smad <dig> is more efficiently induced by alk <dig> than by alk <dig>  in addition, smad <dig> is more efficient in blocking signaling via alk <dig> than alk <dig>  previously, smad <dig> was shown to be induced by, and to be a general inhibitor of, tgf-β superfamily signaling in various non-ecs  <cit> . specific factors present in ecs are likely to be the reason why smad <dig> is much more important feedback inhibitor downstream of alk <dig> than alk <dig> signaling in ecs, compared to tgf-β and bmp signaling in other cell types.

the proposed mechanism by which pp <dig> mediates the dephosphorylation of alk <dig> in ecs is reminiscent to that recently reported for the recruitment of pp <dig> by smad <dig> to alk <dig> in epithelial cells  <cit> . shi and co-workers reported that smad <dig> interacts with gadd <dig>  a regulatory subunit of pp <dig> holoenzyme. pp1c is recruited to alk <dig> via a smad7-gadd <dig> complex and then dephosphorylates activated alk <dig>  sara enhances the recruitment of pp1c to the smad7-gadd <dig> complex by enhancing the availability of pp1c to the smad7-gadd <dig> complex. which regulatory subunit of pp1α holoenzyme cooperates with smad <dig> to interact with alk <dig> remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that upon its induction by the tgf-β/alk <dig> pathway, smad <dig> recruits pp1α to alk <dig>  and thereby inhibit tgf-β/alk1-induced smad1/ <dig> phosphorylation. smad <dig> functions in different ways to exert its antagonistic effects. besides the recruitment of pp <dig> by smad <dig> to the phosphorylated type i receptor to dephosphorylate and inactivate it, smad <dig> has been shown to compete with r-smads for binding to activated type i receptors and thereby inhibit phosphorylation of r-smads  <cit> . our results do not exclude the possibility that alk1/smad signaling is subject to this type of inhibitory regulation by smad <dig>  in addition, smad <dig> can recruit smurf e3-ubiquitin ligases to the activated type i receptor, resulting in receptor ubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . treatment of ecs with proteasome inhibitor revealed that tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling is also negatively regulated by the proteasome pathway ; whether this occurs at receptor or smad level remains to be elucidated. further experiments are needed to examine the contribution of pp <dig> compared to other mechanisms of negative control by smad <dig> in tgf-β/alk <dig> signaling.
