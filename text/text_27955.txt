BACKGROUND
the ccctc-binding factor  is a c2h2-zinc finger protein with eleven zinc fingers that display close to 100% similarity between mouse, chicken, and human  <cit> . ctcf has a versatile role in genome regulation including transcriptional regulation, e.g., c-myc <cit> , x chromosome inactivation  <cit> , allele-specific silencing at imprinted loci such as igf2/h <dig> <cit> , and regulation of expression of lineage-specific gene clusters such as the β-globin locus  <cit>  and the mhc class ii locus  <cit> . recently, ctcf has been implicated in splicing through its action on local rna polymerase ii pausing  <cit> , trinucleotide repeat instability  <cit> , dna replication  <cit> , and nucleosome positioning  <cit> . because of these diverse functional roles in genome regulation, ctcf has been dubbed the “master weaver” of the genome  <cit> .

ctcf sometimes co-localizes with cohesin  <cit> . cohesin, a multi-subunit complex, consists of a heterodimer of smc  proteins, smc <dig>  and smc <dig> , with rad <dig>  and stag . cohesin was initially identified for its role in sister chromatid cohesion  <cit>  but has been implicated in regulation of gene expression  <cit>  and dna replication  <cit> . schmidt et al. have shown that cohesin can also bind to thousands of sites independent of ctcf  <cit> .

the first genome-wide study of the ctcf binding in human cell lines identified ~ <dig>  ctcf binding sites  <cit> . most of these sites were located far from the annotated transcriptional start sites . a subsequent analysis of ctcf binding in three human cell lines showed that they had around 40-60% of the ctcf binding sites in common  <cit> . recently, chen et al.  <cit>  identified ~ <dig>  constitutive ctcf sites in  <dig> human cell types and showed that a large proportion of the variable ctcf binding between different cell types is linked to differential dna methylation. a study of the evolution of ctcf binding in six representative mammals identified thousands of highly conserved, robust and tissue-independent ctcf binding sites  <cit> . those studies suggest that, unlike many other transcription factors/proteins, a substantial portion of ctcf sites may be bound across multiple cell lines, i.e., bound constitutively.

the canonical ctcf binding motif is  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs  long  <cit> . earlier studies suggested ctcf may be capable of binding to sequences of as long as 40– <dig> bp  <cit> . footprinting of ctcf binding to the amyloid precursor protein  promoter confirmed that ctcf can bind to a 40-bp fragment  <cit> . recently, schmidt et al.  <cit>  identified a 33/34-mer full-spectrum ctcf motif in a subset of evolutionarily conserved ctcf binding loci.

given its diverse functional roles in genome regulation, different “classes” of ctcf binding sites might exist where each class has a unique co-factor  and/or has different binding specificity . in this computational study, we examine the functional relevance of a unique “class” of ctcf binding sites – those that were constitutively bound across multiple human cell lines and co-localized with constitutively bound cohesin loci. we operationally refer to a binding site that was bound by a protein in 90% or more of available cell lines as a “constitutive” site.

genome-wide ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions have been mapped using chromatin interaction analysis paired-end tags  in mouse es cells  <cit>  and in k <dig> and mcf <dig> cell lines . chia-pet identifies specific long-range chromatin interactions where widely separated genomic regions are brought to spatial proximity mediated by a protein detected by chip  <cit> .

recently, guelen et al.  <cit>  identified ~ <dig> sharply defined large domains defined by interactions with nuclear lamina components. similarly, dixon et al.  <cit>  identified two to three thousand topological domains in multiple cell and tissue types by hi-c  <cit> . both studies suggested that human/mammalian genomes are partitioned into large, discrete domains that are units of chromosome organization. dixon et al.  <cit>  and meuleman et al.  <cit>  further proposed that these topological domains are common across different cell types and highly conserved across species. both studies found that boundaries are enriched with ctcf sites. those studies reinforce the notion that ctcf plays an important role in genome organization.

using chip-seq  datasets from encode  <cit>  , we identified ~ <dig>  constitutive ctcf binding sites, ~ <dig>  of which further co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci. our computational analysis further revealed that the ctcf-mediated chromatin interaction regions detected by chia-pet in both k <dig> and mcf <dig> cell lines were enriched with sites where constitutive ctcf and constitutive cohesin co-localized  <cit> . furthermore, we found that these ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions were predominantly within topological domains rather than between them. those results suggest that sites with constitutive ctcf plus constitutive cohesin may be involved in establishing/maintaining global chromatin structure that is common across cell lines  <cit> .

RESULTS
definition
encode  <cit>  makes available chip-seq data for ctcf as well as other proteins, with multiple cell lines available for some proteins. these data allowed us to identify ctcf binding sites within ctcf peaks and within chip-seq peaks for other proteins. we refer to a genomic site that is bound by a protein in more than 90% of cell lines as a “constitutive” site . . we used those ctcf binding sites as surrogates both to identify constitutive ctcf loci and to identify, for other proteins, their constitutive loci that overlapped with constitutive ctcf loci .

because all analyses involved ctcf binding sites in terms of constitutive sites, we simply refer to constitutive ctcf sites in ctcf peaks as constitutive ctcf sites, with ctcf here being the protein, not the motif. throughout the manuscript, we used ‘c’ in front a protein to denote constitutive and ‘/’ between proteins to denote co-localization or overlap. for instance, a cctcf/crad <dig> site is a constitutive ctcf site within a ctcf peak that also lies within a constitutive rad <dig> peak. we also use ‘site’ to indicate a motif site, as distinct from a ‘peak’ from chip-seq. we also refer to a broader region near a binding site as a locus.

constitutive ctcf sites
we identified  <dig>  unique ctcf binding sites in the  <dig> human ctcf chip-seq datasets representing  <dig> cell lines . over half of these sites  were identified only in a single cell line, suggesting that those ctcf sites may be cell-line specific. recently, wang et al.  <cit>  found that differential dna methylation of the ctcf binding sites may count for a considerable portion of cell-selective regulation of ctcf binding. a substantial number  of ctcf sites were identified in more than 90%  of the cell lines, suggesting that those ctcf sites may be involved in some fundamental biological process common to most or all cell lines. one might consider the ctcf sites bound in all cell lines as the constitutive sites . chip-seq data is imperfect, however, so we regarded that criterion as too stringent – especially for questions of co-localization. our goal was to probe the functional relevance of certain classes of ctcf sites, not to identify individual sites.

constitutive ctcf/cohesin sites
to characterize co-localization with cohesin, we predicted the ctcf binding sites in rad <dig> peaks from  <dig> chip-seq datasets in six cell lines and in smc <dig> peaks from four encode chip-seq datasets in four cell lines . we identified  <dig>  constitutive ctcf sites in rad <dig> chip-seq peaks and  <dig>  constitutive ctcf sites in smc <dig> peaks . ninety per cent of the csmc <dig> sites overlapped with the crad <dig> sites. the majority of crad <dig> sites  and of csmc <dig> sites  overlapped with cctcf sites . we refer to the constitutive ctcf sites in ctcf peaks that overlap with the constitutive ctcf sites in both rad <dig> and smc <dig> peaks as the cctcf/ccohesin sites  . the association of ctcf with cohesin is known  <cit> , however, we refined that result by showing that this association was strongest when both are constitutive .

1to be declared constitutive, a site had to be identified in ≥90% of available cell lines.

among the  <dig>  cctcf sites,  <dig>  overlapped with ccohesin  sites. only  <dig> of the remaining  <dig>  cctcf sites did not overlap with any rad21/smc <dig>  sites in the four cell lines with smc <dig> chip-seq data available. we refer to these  <dig> sites as the cctcf without any cohesin sites or cctcf-non-cohesin sites and contrast their properties with those of cctcf/ccohesin sites. those cctcf sites that overlap with cohesin loci in one, two or three of the four cell lines are not classified as either cctcf/ccohesin or cctcf-non-cohesin. .

cctcf sites are more conserved than non-constitutive ctcf sites
to see if cctcf sites are more likely to be conserved than non-constitutive ctcf sites, we extracted the multiz alignments of both the  <dig>  human cctcf and an equal number of randomly selected non-constitutive human ctcf sites and scanned for ctcf binding sites . as expected, the cctcf sites are twice more likely to be conserved among species than the con-constitutive ctcf sites . on average, cctcf sites could be found in  <dig> species compared to  <dig> for non-constitutive ctcf sites.

most cctcf/ccohesin sites are distant from promoters and lack cpg islands
most cctcf/ccohesin sites were located in intergenic or intronic regions, away from transcription start sites  and without cpg islands . the lack of cpg islands near the cctcf/ccohesin sites is consistent with the finding that a considerable portion of the cell-type variable ctcf binding sites are subject to differential dna methylation  <cit> . dna methylation in cpg islands near ctcf binding sites affects ctcf binding and, subsequently, transcription regulation of the nearby enhancer elements  <cit> . together, those results suggest that the role of the cctcf/ccohesin sites may be structural rather than transcriptional. in contrast, the cctcf-non-cohesin sites tend to be located near tss and in cpg islands .

cctcf/ccohesin loci are associated with constitutive open chromatin
we examined other proteins for possible association with cctcf loci. in each cell line separately, we counted how often a protein had the center of its chip-seq peak within ± 200 bp from ctcf sites in three classes: the  <dig>  cctcf/ccohesin sites, the  <dig> cctcf-non-cohesin sites, and all ctcf sites bound in the given cell line but excluding the cctcf sites. we used all encode tfbs datasets , histone modification datasets , and open chromatin datasets . the total number of histone marks analysed was  <dig> . ctcf, rad <dig>  and smc3were not included in the analysis. in total, we included  <dig> chip-seq datasets representing  <dig> factors in this analysis and combined results from all cell lines for the same factor/feature.

on average, 74% of the cctcf/ccohesin sites overlapped with dnase i  <cit>  peaks compared to only 44% of the cctcf-non-cohesin sites or 15% of all ctcf sites bound in a given cell line excluding cctcf sites ; the same pattern held with faire  <cit>  peaks . these results together indicate that cctcf/ccohesin sites are highly associated with open chromatin. h2a.z was also more likely to be associated with the cctcf compared to all ctcf sites bound in a given cell line excluding cctcf sites . several factors, especially those that tend to be associated with actively transcribed genes or located at the proxy promoter such as h3k4me <dig> were more likely to be associated with the cctcf-non-cohesin sites .

cctcf/ccohesin loci are enriched with the 33/34-mer and 20/26-mer motifs
the motif logo of the extended cctcf/ccohesin sites  showed information flanking the 16-bp core ctcf motif , indicative of the existence of additional motifs. to discover those motifs, we used the  <dig>  cctcf/ccohesin sequences. at each of the 30+30+16-5+1= <dig> positions, we counted the number of sequences in which each of the  <dig>  possible k-mers  occurred as in  <cit> . the counts were then ranked and the top  <dig> k-mers at each side of the core ctcf motif were combined separately to create the composite motif for the side using the position-specific k-mer frequency as the weight.

this process identified a 33/34-mer full-spectrum ctcf motif  that was reported previously  <cit> . in addition, we identified two potentially novel motifs at the other side of the core ctcf motif . it is unclear if the pattern represents two separate motifs  or one single motif . the extra motif in the 20-mer resembled the gaga-binding motif  whereas the extra motif in the 26-mer resembled that for caf <dig>  according to stamp . all of these full-spectrum motifs showed higher enrichment among cctcf/ccohesin loci compared to either cctcf-non-cohesin or all ctcf loci . it is not clear if the additional motifs  at the right side of the canonical motif are bound by ctcf or by a co-factor. this question needs to be determined experimentally.

recently, additional ctcf motifs such as  have been reported  <cit> . however, the proportions of those motifs in the context of the core motif are low ranging from  <dig> % to 4% in cd <dig> cells. we estimated that the proportions of those motifs in both cctcf and non-constitutive ctcf loci were ~ <dig> %.

cctcf is enriched in ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions
several studies have implicated ctcf in mediating long-range chromatin interactions  <cit> . the genome-wide ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions in cell lines k <dig> and mcf <dig> have been mapped using chromatin interaction analysis paired-end tags  from encode/gis-ruan. in cell line k <dig>  we identified  <dig>  unique ctcf binding sites  in ctcf chip-seq peaks, among which  <dig>  were cctcf sites. the proportion of chia-pet interaction sites among these cctcf sites was significantly higher than the corresponding proportion among the non-constitutive ctcf binding sites  . this enrichment was also seen for cell line mcf <dig>  . the majority of the cctcf sites  overlapped with the chromatin interaction regions compared to only 16% and 35% of the non-constitutive ctcf sites. similarly, we found that among all ctcf-mediated interactions, more interactions involved cctcf than the non-constitutive ctcf in both k <dig> and mcf <dig> cell lines , respectively, despite there being  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more non-constitutive ctcf sites than cctcf sites in those cell lines. together those results suggest that chromatin interactions may be mediated largely by cctcf sites.

because of the strong association between cctcf and ccohesin in k <dig> and mcf <dig> cell lines, we found that the odds of chia-pet detected interactions were approximately  <dig> times greater among the cctcf/ccohesin sites than among the cctcf sites without ccohesin  .

interplay between topological domains and cctcf sites
two recent studies  <cit>  suggested that human/mammalian genomes are divided into large, discrete domains that are units of chromosome organization. dixon et al.  <cit>  further proposed that the topological domains are common across different cell types and highly conserved across species. those results, together with our chia-pet results, suggest that chromatin topological domains and ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions may be intrinsically linked.

indeed, we found that 87% of the ctcf-mediated interactions from chia-pet in either k <dig> or mcf <dig> cell line were within the topological domains of h1hesc cell line   <cit> . importantly, among those ctcf-mediated intrachromosomal interactions that were in the topological domains, 77% to 81% had both regions of the pair in the same domain, suggesting that the ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions are predominantly within a domain. more than 90% of both cctcf and non-constitutive ctcf sites were located inside the topological domains. however, the non-constitutive ctcf sites tended to be uniformly distributed within the domain whereas the cctcf sites appear to be enriched near the boundaries of the domains . as a control, we selected five other encode tfbs chip-seq datasets with the highest number of peaks  and computed the distances between the chip-seq peaks and the nearest topological domains. similar to the non-constitutive ctcf sites, the distribution of the distances for the five proteins in each cell is more uniform than the corresponding distribution for cctcf .

discussion
ctcf is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, insulation, dna replication, x-chromosome inactivation, splicing chromatin packaging and many others  <cit> . ctcf binding sites are widespread in genomes from fly to humans  <cit> . earlier, several genome-wide studies identified ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  ctcf binding sites in several human cell lines. those studies also showed that 40-60% of the ctcf sites in the cell lines studied were invariant to cell types  <cit> . many ctcf binding sites were also computationally identified  <cit>  and found to be conserved  <cit> . however, it remained unclear how many ctcf binding sites are present in the human genome and what proportion of them is constitutively bound across most cell lines/tissues. a comprehensive ctcf binding site database containing more than  <dig> million sequences in  <dig> species has been recently updated to include long-range chromatin interaction data mediated by ctcf  <cit> , thereby facilitating analyses like ours in non-human species.

our analysis of  <dig> encode ctcf chip-seq datasets representing  <dig> human cell lines suggests that there might be as many as  <dig>  ctcf binding sites in the human genome. nearly half were found in ctcf peaks in only one of the  <dig> cell lines. about a quarter million of the ctcf sites were found in ctcf peaks in more than one of the  <dig> cell lines. moreover, ~ <dig>  ctcf binding sites were found in ctcf peaks in more than 90%  cell lines, suggesting that those constitutive ctcf sites may be implicated in some fundamental biological process/function for most or all cell lines.

of course, the exact numbers of cctcf sites identified by our methods depend on thresholds used for making decisions. in our analysis, we trimmed/extended all peaks to 200 bp in length from the center. using 300 bp instead increased by  <dig>  the number of ctcf sites declared constitutive. including these additional sites in our analysis of chia-pet interactions yielded results substantially the same as those in table  <dig>  in our analysis, a p-value cut-off of  <dig>  on the pwm score identified a ctcf binding site in 80-95% of the peaks. adjusting the cut-off would certainly affect the number of ctcf sites identified and declared constitutive; but, like changing the peak length, changing this cut-off seems unlikely to influence our results about enrichment and our overall conclusions about the role of cctcf sites.

because many datasets used in our analysis were from cancer cell lines which often carry genetic and chromatin aberrations, we looked for evidence that cctcf sites might diverge between cancer and normal cell lines. we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  cctcf sites in recently deposited ctcf chip-seq from  <dig> cancer cell lines,  <dig> normal cell lines, and  <dig> cell lines with unknown karyotypes, respectively  <cit> . not only did these three groups have similar numbers of cctcf sites, they had  <dig>   cctcf sites in common, indicating that cell origins have little effect on the number or locations of cctcf sites.

the nature of chip-seq experiments is to capture a snapshot of protein binding in time. thus, the sites that we define as constitutive because they are bound in over 90% of cell lines are likely sites where a protein spends most time in the bound state -- perhaps an individual binding event of long duration or perhaps frequent bouts of binding/unbinding with the bound state predominating. long-duration binding might be attributed to strong binding whereas frequent binding/unbinding would not be. thus, the constitutive sites that we detect should not correspond exactly to sites with strong binding, though different binding motifs  might be correlated with binding strength. on the other hand, one can imagine sites in the genome where a protein bound relatively briefly but the site is bound at some time in every tissue or cell line. such a site would theoretically meet our definition of ‘constitutive’ but would go undetected by our analysis as chip-seq snapshots would be virtually impossible to capture short-term binding at the same site in multiple cell lines.

strong binding may occur at constitutive sites, but it may not be the only explanation for their existence. we recently developed an alternative method for identifying constitutive sites using peak data only  . we identified constitutive sites for  <dig> factors with chip-seq data in more than six cell lines. we found that the proportions of constitutive sites vary between different factors from a few to many thousands. it is unlikely that factors that bind to the highest number of constitutive sites  are strong binders whereas those that bind to the fewest constitutive sites  are weaker binders. we also found that gene ontology analysis of the target genes of the constitutive pol ii sites are highly enriched with biological processes such as metabolism and cell cycle . together, those results strongly suggest that the constitutive sites are biologically meaningful.

because of ctcf’s diverse roles in genome regulation, different “classes” of ctcf binding sites might exist to carry out different functional roles. such classes might differ in their co-factors and/or binding strength and specificity . in this study, we focused on the class of ctcf binding sites that are constitutively bound and co-localized with the constitutive cohesin loci and compared it to a class of constitutive ctcf binding sites without cohesin. we examined the genomic features, transcriptional landscape and epigenetic environments of those sites to gain insights into their functional relevance. our analysis not only included many more datasets but also was more comprehensive than the earlier analyses of ctcf binding sites  <cit> .

we identified ~ <dig>  constitutive ctcf binding sites co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci. the majority of these cctcf/ccohesin sites were located ≥  <dig> kb from the tss in introns or in intergenic regions that lacked cpg islands. furthermore, the cctcf/ccohesin loci were enriched in h3k4me <dig> mark with well-positioned nucleosomes . a substantial number of the cctcf sites overlapped with cohesin in one or more cell lines without meeting the criterion that the corresponding rad <dig> and smc <dig> peaks were in ≥ 90% of available cell lines. in contrast, few cctcf sites did not co-localize with cohesin loci in any cell line.

our analysis of the constitutive sites is limited by the number of cell lines studied; some factors have data from only a limited number of cell lines. as data from additional cell lines become available, some of the cctcf/ccohesin sites will no longer be designated as constitutive. although the cctcf sites were found in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> cell lines, constitutive cohesin was defined via rad <dig> and smc <dig> peaks, which were identified in only  <dig> and  <dig> cell lines, respectively.

numerous studies have shown that ctcf cooperates with cohesin to contribute to dna loop formation to thereby regulate gene expression and chromatin interactions  <cit> , dna replication  <cit> , rna pol ii pausing  <cit> . our computational analysis revealed that the strength of association between ctcf and cohesin increases when both sites/loci were constitutive, similarly for ctcf and znf <dig> , and for ctcf, cohesin, and znf <dig> .

a footprinting study of ctcf binding to the promoter of the app gene showed that the binding of the full-length ctcf protein generated a dnase i protected region covering 40 bp  <cit> . subsequent motif analysis  <cit>  in a set of evolutionarily conserved ctcf sites identified ~ <dig>  33/34-mer full-spectrum ctcf binding sites. we independently identified the same 33/34-mer motifs in the set of cctcf/ccohesin loci. furthermore, we also identified two potentially novel 20/26-mer ctcf motifs . whether those full-spectrum motifs function in transcriptional regulation or in mediating chromatin-chromatin interactions, or both, remains unclear.

our analysis in cancer cell lines k <dig> and mcf <dig> further revealed that the majority of the cctcf sites were located in the ctcf-mediated chromatin interactions from chia-pet  <cit> . the proportion of the cctcf sites in the chromatin interactions was higher for those cctcf sites that overlapped with ccohesin loci than for those that did not. these results suggest that the genomic loci that are constitutively co-bound by both ctcf and cohesin may be involved in establishing or maintaining the “common” or “ground state” chromatin architecture in most human cell lines . this idea is consistent with the finding that the overall topological domain structure between cell/tissue types or across species is largely unchanged  <cit> . hu et al. further suggested that the geometric shapes of the topological domains are strongly correlated with several genomic and epigenetic features  <cit> . we found that most ctcf-mediated interactions from chia-pet  <cit>  involved cctcf and were within a domain. it is conceivable that the cctcf/ccohesin sites are an integral part of the large, discrete domains  <cit> , possibly mediating/maintaining the sub-domain structures within a domain.

CONCLUSIONS
using encode chip-seq data we identified ~ <dig>  ctcf binding sites in ctcf peaks from  <dig> cell lines. we also identified ~ <dig>  cctcf and ~ <dig>  cctcf/ccohesin binding sites. the cctcf sites were located in unique genomic environments and were over-represented in ctcf-mediated global chromatin interactions that are predominantly within, but not between, the proposed topological domains. we suggest that ctcf and cohesin cooperate in those loci to establish/maintain the “common” chromatin structure in most human cell lines.
