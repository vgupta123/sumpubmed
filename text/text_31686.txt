BACKGROUND
reverse genetics relies on the use of molecular biological methods to discover the function of a gene by analyzing the phenotypic effects that result from a manipulation of its function. while this approach mostly leads to valid information about the role of a gene in the physiology of the respective organism, some caveats are to be applied when these mutants are studied by –omics techniques: many gene mutants also display altered growth rates, and thus studying their gene or protein expression on plates or in batch cultures will inevitably also identify genes whose expression is controlled only by the growth rate itself. this may lead to flawed interpretations as to the potential targets of the investigated genes, particularly in the case of regulatory genes.

the aspergillus nidulans laea protein, a putative s-adenosylmethionine-dependent  methyltransferase, was originally described as a global regulator of secondary metabolism  <cit> . laea is known to be a nuclear protein, and is localized to the nucleus . it has therefore been suggested that it regulates transcription by protein lysine or protein arginine methyltransferase functions  <cit> , and its function has putatively been linked to changes in chromatin structure  <cit> . recent studies in a. nidulans, however, failed to identify a protein that is methylated by laea, but considerable automethylation was observed  <cit> . in addition, the lae1-  effected transcriptome of trichoderma reesei showed no correlation with histone methylation at the affected loci  <cit> .

laea was later shown to also control developmental events, such as conidiation in numerous fungi , and fruiting body formation in a. flavus <cit> . we have recently shown that in t. reesei, lae <dig> also controls conidiation, the expression of polysaccharide hydrolytic enzymes and of genes involved in eco-physiological fitness, whereas the effect on secondary metabolite biosynthesis was not that strongly pronounced as in the aspergilli <cit> . thus, current knowledge suggests that laea has a dynamic role in both fungal morphological and chemical development, and nutrition.

in t. reesei, lae <dig> mutants are also differing in their growth rates, being slower in the loss-of-function mutant and faster in mutants overexpressing lae <dig> <cit> . we thus wondered to which extent our recent study on the lae1-effected transcriptome of t. reesei <cit>  would have been biased by the different growth rates of the lae <dig> mutants. this could have been particularly due for genes that are known to be expressed only at specific growth rates, such as e.g. those involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis. therefore, we chose to use chemostat cultures on d-glucose as a carbon source at two different growth rates  to investigate the genome-wide changes in gene expression in relation to lae <dig> function, using Δlae <dig> and oelae <dig> recombinant mutant strain of t. reesei.

RESULTS
verification of the experimental strategy
constant-mass, carbon-limited, chemostat-type continuous fermentations were used to cultivate the parent strain t. reesei qm  <dig>  and the Δlae <dig> and oelae <dig> mutant strains derived from it on glucose  as a sole carbon source at two different dilution rates . these two dilution rates  have previously been shown to represent a state of carbon catabolite repression and of carbon catabolite derepression, respectively, in t. reesei and also in a. nidulans. cultures were grown batchwise for 24 hours after inoculation. at the first 6– <dig> residence times of the continuous cultivations, gradually attenuating oscillation of the specific biomass production occurred  <cit>  after which the oscillation decreased to a non-significant level. the steady-state biomass concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l in all cultures irrespective of the dilution rate. by feeding the cultures with a medium containing 3 g/l d-glucose as a sole carbon source , this biomass data resulted in a calculated growth yield  of between  <dig> and 53% for all cultures, which correlates well with previously published data from various fungal d-glucose-limited cultures , and with our previous studies on t. reesei steady-states  <cit> . the residual glucose concentration was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm at both  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig>  these values correlate well with the affinities of the high affinity hexose transporters of filamentous fungi  <cit> , and thus prove that our cultures were indeed glucose-limited. at  <dig>  h- <dig> the low dilution rate, some conidiospore formation was visible in the parent strain but not at the Δlae1-mutant. in addition, both strains exhibited a small degree of pellet formation although the overwhelming majority of cells displayed filamentous morphology at  <dig>  h- <dig>  in summary, while there were some minor morphological differences between the two strains at the two dilution rates applied, they unlikely affected the general experimental strategy. we thus considered the system appropriate for the purpose of this study.

lae <dig> loss of function is more dominant at high growth rates
 <dig> of the  <dig> genes that were used in the array showed an at least 2-fold up- or downregulation  in t. reesei Δlae <dig> when compared to the parent strain qm  <dig> . of these, only  <dig> genes were >2-fold regulated both at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig>  respectively. the highest number of genes was encountered when the Δlae <dig> mutant was compared to the parent strain qm <dig> at  <dig>  h- <dig> . genes that were downregulated in the Δlae <dig> strain accounted for the minor fraction in both cases .table  <dig>

only a considerably smaller number of genes  was differently regulated between the oelae <dig> mutant and the parent strain . genes that were downregulated accounted for a minor fraction at the high growth rate, but accounted for 61% at the lower growth rate . the validity of the array data was approved by qpcr analysis of the expression of a small number of genes .

under all conditions , more than a third of all genes encoded unknown proteins  or were orphan genes . in order to assess the global changes in gene expression brought about by the two lae <dig> mutations, those genes for which a function was known or can be predicted were classified according to the funcat categorization  <cit> ; figure  <dig>  of these, the majority of genes belonged to category “metabolism”, followed by “cellular transport” and “transcription”. however, none of the categories exhibited a statistically significant difference over another  when the number of genes in the individual categories was related to the total number of genes that were differently expressed under any of these conditions, this indicates that the cellular effect of the two lae <dig> mutations is not reflected by changes in the expression of one general gene category.figure  <dig>

since the effect of lae <dig> modulation may rather be reflected in the expression of genes encoding funcat subcategories, we calculated the percentage of lae1-effected genes of several subcategories in the complete  transcriptome and compared it to the percentage of these subcategories in the whole t. reesei genome. thereby, some significant changes were observed : genes encoding amino acid transporters, heteroincompatibility  proteins, gcn5-n-acetyltransferases, and polyketide synthases  were significantly  more abundant in the transcriptome affected in Δlae <dig> at high growth rates than in the genome. a significantly higher number of genes belonging to the first three gene groups  were differently expressed at the low growth rate. genes encoding the pth11-type receptors were significantly more abundant among genes that are higher expressed in the Δlae <dig> mutant at high growth rates.

in addition, lae1-effected genes involved in metabolism were found to have a strong bias towards amino acid metabolism at the high growth rate, with the majority of them being downregulated . no significant changes in the expression of genes involved in intermediary metabolism  were noted at the low growth rate.table  <dig>

with regards to secondary metabolism, only  <dig> of the  <dig> polyketide synthases , and  <dig> of the  <dig> non-ribosomal peptide synthases  of t. reesei were shown to be affected by a loss of lae <dig> function , and with the exception of the nrps trire2: <dig>  which was downregulated in the Δlae <dig> mutant at both growth rates, all the other genes were down- or upregulated only at d =  <dig>  h- <dig>  it is interesting to note that this number of affected pks- and nrps-encoding genes is nevertheless significantly higher than in our previous study  <cit> , in which only a single nrps gene  was found to be >2-fold downregulated in the Δlae <dig> mutant.

we also applied the same analysis to the genes which were at least 2-fold differently regulated between the oelae <dig> mutant and the parent . however, no specific gene category or subcategory was found to accumulate to a significant extent.

lae <dig> loss-of-function affects growth rate regulation of gene expression
while the above data revealed genes that are affected by lae <dig> function at a constant growth rate, we surmised that there may be also genes whose response to changes in the growth rate is dependent on lae <dig>  to this end we retrieved two data sets: one which contained genes that were growth rate dependent in t. reesei wild-type, but not in Δlae <dig>  and another one which contained only genes whose expression was growth rate dependent in the Δlae <dig> mutant strain, but not in the wild type. this revealed a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively. their annotation is given in additional files  <dig> and 5: tables s <dig> and s5: as can be seen, no specific gene category was significantly enriched in these two gene pools, indicating that the interference of lae <dig> with growth-rate regulation affects specific genes rather than gene groups of similar function. a similar analysis was also made for the effect of lae <dig> overexpression. again, the number of genes was considerably smaller, and the majority of them consisted of unknown proteins .

in addition, we also monitored those genes, whose growth-rate dependent expression in the lae <dig> mutants was reverted, i.e. opposite as to the parent strain.  <dig> genes that were higher expressed at the high growth rate in t. reesei qm  <dig> were found to be downregulated in t. reesei Δlae <dig>  and  <dig> genes displayed the opposite trend. no specific funcat category or subcategory was detected to be enriched in these two groups, which accounted for only a minor portion of the lae <dig> effected transcriptome .

the majority of genes effected by lae <dig> are not clustered in the genome
we were further interested whether the genes affected in their expression by lae <dig> function would show a clustering in the genome. to test this, we made use of reef, a program that performs a serial hypergeometric distribution tests in a sliding window along the chromosomes implemented in phyton program  <cit> . this program has the advantage that it uses statistical models to assess the significance of physical clusters detected. it has also previously shown to lead results consistent with other methods  <cit> . reef detected  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> and  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the Δlae <dig> and the parent strain during cultivation at high and low growth rate, respectively, to be clustered in the genome . the clustering was evident from a  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold enrichment in gene density in the transcripts from high and low growth rates, respectively, over the average distribution in the genome.  <dig> and  <dig> clusters were found for the transcripts from high and low growth rate, of which  <dig> were present under both conditions.  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, occurred with a  <dig>  bp distance from one of the ends of the respective scaffold. this demonstrates that about a tenth of the genes affected in their expression by lae <dig> loss-of-function are clustered in the genome.table  <dig>

we also evaluated the genes contained in these clusters, but no obvious trend was seen: gene groups more frequently occurring were identical to those more abundant in the genome. we also specifically looked for clustering of genes encoding secondary metabolites  and potentially being involved in their biosynthesis  but obtained a similar result .

discussion
to investigate the physiology of microbial mutant strains, they are usually cultivated on solid medium or in batch cultures. under both conditions, individual nutrients will gradually become growth limiting, and cause changes in the actual specific growth rates, that in turn may profoundly influence the metabolism and consequently the physiology of the cell. while this fact has been well considered in studies of yeasts and bacteria, much fewer reports are available for the applications of methods that take the specific growth rate into consideration for filamentous fungal research .

because of this similarity to methyltransferases and its localization to the nucleus, laea/lae <dig> has been postulated to regulate transcription by lysine or arginine protein methyltransferase functions  <cit> . however, subsequent work showed that lae1-modulated expression of genes in t. reesei did not correlate with corresponding changes in the histone methylation state at these gene loci  <cit> . in addition, patananan et al.  <cit> , using several different experimental approaches failed to identify a protein or other substrate in a. nidulans that becomes methylated by laea. instead, laea was shown to methylate itself at m <dig>  yet this methylation was not essential for laea function, and the corresponding m <dig> does also not occur in the t. reesei lae <dig>  all this evidence suggests that laea/lae <dig> may exert its function by binding to other proteins rather than by methylating histones or other dna-binding proteins.

laea has been isolated because of its role as a regulator of secondary metabolism in a. nidulans <cit> , and it was therefore surprising that we recently found only a single nrps to be downregulated in the Δlae <dig> mutant  <cit> . in the present study, two pks and one nrps genes were affected by lae <dig> loss-of function, and this effect occurred only at the high growth rate . the fact that our previous study was performed with lactose grown cells  <cit>  may explain this discrepancy, because growth on lactose is characterized by a very slow growth rate. thus the effect of lae <dig> on secondary metabolism in t. reesei appears to be growth rate dependent, and more pronounced at the high growth rate. veiga et al.  <cit>  have also found a growth rate-dependency of laea and vea function in penicillium chrysogenum, although in the opposite direction.

our data also showed that only a comparatively small percentage of the genes that are affected by lae <dig> modulation  are in fact clustered in the genome. this value is much smaller than clustering percentages obtained for gene expression in t. reesei under other conditions such as conidiation  <cit> . while a similar clustering analysis of differently expressed genes in t. reesei growing on glycerol and glucose yielded still a lower value , the significance of the 10% found in this study is unclear. in any case, the data show that most of the genes that are affected by lae <dig> loss of function do not appear to be clustered in the genome of t. reesei.

however, the present study revealed a new level at which laea/lae <dig> may control gene expression: we show that the expression of 50% of the gcn5-n-acetyltransferases  present in the t. reesei genome is altered in the Δlae <dig> strain, most of them being downregulated. this effect of lae <dig> has not been revealed in previous studies  <cit> , probably due to the use of batch cultures or of different carbon sources. gnats catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme a to a primary amine. while – despite of the similarity to the gcn <dig> protein of the saga complex  <cit>  - some of them may thus fulfill metabolic functions, a subgroup of them is known to acetylate histones at specific lysine residues, a process that leads to transcriptional activation and has been implicated in chromatin assembly  <cit> . unfortunately, none of the t. reesei gnats has so far been functionally investigated, but one – trire2: <dig> – has been shown to be induced on the cellulase inducing carbon sources cellulose  <cit>  and lactose  <cit> , is downregulated in t. reesei Δlae <dig> strain  <cit>  and its overexpression in t. reesei leads to a twofold stimulation of cellulase production. this gene is, however, not expressed on glucose and was therefore not detected under the conditions of this work. however, the above noted correlation between lae <dig> function and action of the gnat trire2: <dig> may also be valid for several of the gnats detected to be lae1-dependent in this work. in a. nidulans, laea function has recently also been linked to histone acetylation: in a multicopy suppressor screen for genes capable of restoring secondary metabolite production in an a. nidulans Δlaea mutant, the histone acetyltransferase esaa was identified  <cit> . however, esaa binds to the target histone by a chromo-domain and is a member of the myb_cef protein family , and not a gnat. thus, a direct link between gnats and laea/lae <dig>  which may explain the postulated laea-dependent chromatin modification  <cit> , still requires scientific testing. interestingly, an orthologue of s. cerevisiae spt <dig> – an acetyltransferase that directly activates the transcription of histone genes, and whose function is essential for normal cell division  <cit>  – is also strongly downregulated in the t. reesei Δlae <dig> mutant. its downregulation in t. reesei Δlae <dig> may be a factor contributing to the slower growth observed in this mutant. we should also like to note that the other observed effects such as changes in the growth-rate dependent regulation in the Δlae <dig> strain would be fully compatible with an action of lae <dig> via gnats, because acetylation by them can also lead to repression of gene expression  <cit> .

another group of genes that were significantly influenced by lae <dig> in this study – but not detected to be affected previously  <cit>  – were amino acid transporters. these transporters can reliably be predicted by the presence of a common structural motif consisting of  <dig> alpha-helical putative transmembrane segments and cytoplasmically located n- and c-terminal hydrophilic regions, and belong to the amino acid/polyamine organocation superfamily  <cit> . in yeasts, they are usually absent during growth on an inorganic nitrogen source but upregulated once organic nitrogen becomes available, using transcriptional  <cit>  and/or posttranscriptional mechanisms  <cit> . in contrast, the present study shows that these amino acid transporters are expressed in t. reesei during growth on an inorganic nitrogen source. these finding is also consistent with the observation that t. reesei prefers amino acids as carbon sources when grown in the presence of cellulose or lactose and amino acid mixtures  <cit> , and thus regulation of expression of these permease genes still deserves attention. interestingly, there is now emerging evidence that amino acid uptake in yeast is regulated by gnat-dependent histone acetylation  <cit> , which would fit to the above supposed role of lae <dig> in histone acetylation. we also noted that the effect of lae <dig> on amino acid permeases is paralleled by a severe downregulation of a significant number of genes involved in amino acid metabolism in t. reesei Δlae <dig> , and the above findings of regulation of amino acid uptake by lae <dig> can therefore be extended to a general effect on amino acid metabolism. also, some extracellular proteases and oligopeptide transporters were effected by lae <dig> , but these two groups as a whole remained not significantly affected.

most of the other funcat groups found to be influenced by lae <dig> function were already identified in our earlier study, which used lactose as a carbon source to induce cellulase gene expression  <cit> . yet differences in the numbers of genes in the individual groups were noted. it is unclear, however, whether these observations are growth rate- or carbon source-specific.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we used growth at controlled growth rates on glucose as a limiting carbon source to study the changes in gene expression effected by the protein methyltransferase lae <dig> in t. reesei at a genome wide level. the corresponding results confirm several previously detected targets, but also reveal new findings: on one hand, the effect of lae <dig> becomes mainly visible upon its deletion whereas overexpression has only a little effect. also genomic clustering of the lae1-effected transcripts was observed to a much lower extent than previously  <cit> , and is thus either due to the use of glucose as a carbon source or the use of constant growth rates for comparison. however, we detect for the first time that lae <dig> gene deletion affect the regulation of gene expression by the growth rate. the latter finding likely points to an indirect influence, and suggests that lae <dig> influences the formation of both positive as well negative signals or regulators of the respective genes. on the other hand, additional lae <dig> targets were obtained of which the gcn5-n-acetyltransferases may offer a new understanding of the mechanism of lae <dig> action. our data show that – using t. reesei lae <dig> as a model – the investigation of the transcriptome in a regulatory mutant at constant growth rates may reveal new insights into the function of the respective gene.
