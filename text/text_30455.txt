BACKGROUND
most mammalian dna is depleted with cpg dinucleotides  <cit>  whose fraction in a mammalian genome is close to  <dig> - <dig>  of the value expected from presupposition of random distribution  <cit> . the shortage of genomic cpg dinucleotides is believed to be the consequence of frequent mutation of mcpg to tpg dinucleotides  <cit> . nevertheless, some mammalian genomic segments called cpg islands   <cit>  possess a high g+c content, with a frequency of cpg close to the expected value. in bioinformatics, cgis are usually defined as dna segments that are longer than  <dig> bp, have above 50% g+c content, and have a cpg frequency of at least  <dig>  of that expected assuming letters at each sequence position occurring independently at random with the given composition  <cit> . the number of cgis varies substantially in different vertebrate species  <cit> . there are about  <dig>  such cgis in the human genome, of which approximately  <dig>  are in repeat-masked sequences  <cit> .

the increased number of cpg sites in cgis is often correlated with low methylation of cytosine in cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . this effect is usually explained by postulating protection of these sites from dna methyltransferase by abundant and commonly utilized dna binding proteins including sp <dig>  <cit> , e2f  <cit> , ctcf  <cit>  and others. the sp <dig> protein is particularly strongly implicated in cgi functioning. gardiner-garden and frommer observed  <cit>  that cgis contain many "g/c boxes", composed of the sequence gggcgg, demonstrated to act as binding sites for the sp <dig> transcription factor  <cit> . later, it was found that sp <dig> can bind to both methylated and non-methylated variants of this binding site  <cit> , and can protect non-methylated sites from methylation  <cit> .

in his recent study rozenberg et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that binding sites of several regulatory proteins, including sp <dig>  contain a cpg pair and play an important role in the formation of sequences of mouse promoters which regulate the expression of housekeeping genes. this suggests that cgis overlapping with promoters of housekeeping genes are related to their transcription initiation. according to  <cit>  60% of widely expressed human genes and up to 40% of tissue-specific genes are associated with cpg islands. it has been shown lately that 72% of all promoters have high cpg content, and only 28% are in the class with low cpg content  <cit> .

cgis located near 5' region of known genes account for only a fraction of all cgis in the genome . although many non-5' associated cgis overlap with repeats  <cit> , many do not  <cit> , but instead are frequently positioned 3' to known genes, overlapping with final transcribed exons  <cit> . amazingly, cgis located in these 3' regions have attracted almost no interest, even though these cgis were mentioned in the publication that initially coined the term "cpg island"  <cit> . more recently, computational approaches have also identified intragenic cgis that overlap neither tss nor final exons  <cit> , although function of these cgis have not yet been assessed.

cgis not associated with 5' region of any gene can perform important biological functions. for instance, a c-to-t substitution in cgi encompassing parts of exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> of uba <dig> affects expression of this gene  <cit> . a cgi located within intron  <dig> of kcnq <dig> and associated with an oppositely-oriented rna transcript is involved in imprinting  of its locus  <cit> . imprinting of map3k <dig> gene is associated with differential methylation of a cgi located in its last exon  <cit> . many cpg islands are located near the 3' ends of genes associated with cancer development  <cit> .

the main objective of this work was to study properties of cgis located far from tss of protein coding genes. we demonstrated that substantial selection pressure is applied to cpg pairs in cgis independently from cgi location in the reference to gene starts locations, which implies functional importance of cpg pairs. we assumed with  <cit>  that most of cgis are involved in transcription initiation, thus one of our objectives was to study transcriptional activity of cgis, particularly of cgis located far from 5' regions of any protein coding gene. to do this we used cap analysis gene expression  tags identified in the fantom project  <cit> . we also assessed the representation of binding motifs recognized by regulatory factor sp <dig> in cgis located in 5', 3' and internal gene regions, as well as out of any known genes. in addition, we re-analyzed the published chip-chip data on sp <dig> binding in chromosomes 21- <dig> and compared sp <dig> binding preferences in dna not overlapping with cgis as well as in cgis located in different gene segments and out of any genes. fraction of non-5' cgi strongly enriched with cage tags was studied with special care; we observed substantial overrepresentation of probably strong sp <dig> binding sites in such cgis and collected known reports of transcription starts sites of long non-coding rnas associated with such cgis.

RESULTS
cgis tend to overlap protein coding exons
tendency of cgis to overlap with exons has been observed many times at limited data sets  <cit> . as the first step of our study we decided to give a quantitative estimation of this tendency separately for exons and introns located in different gene regions. exons and introns were categorized according to their location within the gene . for exons and introns from each category the total length of overlap with cgis was calculated. we used monte carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of the observed total overlap length. a round of simulation was performed as follows. exons  were located as in the human genome and "cgis" were sampled. intervals between cgis were sampled from the interval distribution evaluated from the genome, whereas the lengths of "cgis" were shuffled length of genuine cgis. the total overlap between exons  and "cgis" was calculated. then the whole procedure was repeated with switched cgi and exon sets, i.e. the annotated cgis and "simulated exons " were taken. for each category of gene elements such simulations were repeated  <dig>  times and the observed values of exon  overlapping with cgis were normalized for the average simulated values.

frequent overlapping of cgis with exons cannot be explained as misinterpretation of gc-rich exons as cgis
it is known that exons are usually more gc-rich than introns  <cit> . at the same time, the algorithm for cgi computational identification uses the increased c+g content of a test dna segment as one of the cgi conditions. on the other hand, a cg-rich exon can have an increased number of cpg dinucleotides owing to its specific amino acid composition, e.g. many arginine codons. therefore, this exon would be misidentified as cgi, and many such events would explain an increased overlapping between cgis and exons.

a more interesting alternative explanation of frequent overlapping of cgis with exons is that it is caused by the common preferences of both segments to be located in some particular dna regions. in this case the terminal intron segments that are close to exons would also overlap with cgis more frequently than internal segments of long introns. to test this, we selected  <dig> bp intron fragments adjacent to donor and acceptor splice sites. as in the previous section, we used monte carlo simulations to assess expectation of the observed overall overlap lengths.

in all gene regions synonymous substitution rates of codons that contain cpg dinucleotides are lower in exons overlapping with cgis than in exons not overlapping with cgis
the analysis above demonstrates cgi function is probably carried on at the level of nucleic acids. therefore cgi presence can affect synonymous substitution rate for codons that overlap with cgis. to test this, we compared synonymous  and nonsynonymous  substitution rates in human-mouse alignments for codons overlapping and non-overlapping with cgis. exons located in different parts of genes were considered separately. the substitution rates were calculated for all codons and separately for codons containing cpg, gpc, apg and gpa dinucleotides. the results are presented in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

rates were calculated separately for various gene elements and various classes of codons.

the nonsynonymous substitution rate for codons containing cpg dinucleotides was very similar to that for other codons and depended only weakly on the overlapping with cgis . the main factor affecting rates of nonsynonymous substitutions is the codon location near one of the gene termini. figure  <dig> shows "v"-shaped dn plots for all the codons outside of cgis, which indicates that internal exons are less variable than both terminal exons. this effect may be related to the increased protein variability at the n and c termini. at the same time, codons overlapping with cgis show almost equal dn for the internal and the final exons. thus, proteins coded by genes having a cgi at their 3' end are generally more conserved at their c end.

in contrast, synonymous substitution rates calculated for codons containing cpg dinucleotides were different from those for other codons and dramatically depended on their overlapping with cgis . generally, for codons with cpg dinucleotides overlapping with cgi resulted in ds decrease approximately two-fold . for codons that did not contain cpg the effect of cgi on dswas much smaller. this effect did not depend on the gene region: a cgi overlapping with a 5', intragenic or 3' exon had a similar effect on ds, reducing the synonymous substitution rates of cpg containing codons by 49%, 40% and 37%, respectively.

the observation that cpg containing codons have lower ds when they overlap with cgis gives additional evidence that amino acid composition  cannot explain the abundance of cpg dinucleotides and the frequent overlap of cgis and exons. function of cgi indeed seems to be more related to dna or rna.

enrichment of cgis with cage tags
in the previous sections we have demonstrated that in exons located far downstream from tsss and overlapping with cgis the synonymous substitution rate of cpg-containing codons is reduced. in addition, cgis found far downstream from tss often overlap with exons, but such cgis are unlikely to be the misrecognized exons. assuming that 5' related cgi are involved into transcription initiation  <cit>  we have investigated if cgis located in other genome regions also participate in transcription initiation. to test this suggestion we have studied association of computationally identified cgis with transcription start sites as identified by cage tagging  <cit> . for our analysis we categorized cgis into  <dig> non-overlapping classes:  5' cgis;  intragenic cgis;  3' cgis; and  intergenic cgis . the number of cgi classes is smaller than the number of gene elements because the same cgi can often overlap with several gene elements, e.g. 5' utr, the initial coding exon, the first intron, and sometimes other exons as well as downstream located introns.

cage tags exhibit a clear tendency to cluster within all classes of cgis . cgis occupying about  <dig> % of the entire genome contain more than 48% of all cage tags. about 70% of all cgis contain at least one cage tag. in average 5', intragenic, 3', and intergenic cgis contain respectively one cage tag per  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> base pairs as compared to the average genome cage frequency of  <dig> tag per  <dig>  bp the frequency of cage tags in these cgis is respectively 95-, 9-, 22-, and 11-fold greater than in the genome in average respectively with cgi class. a 5' cgi contains in average  <dig> cage tags; the number of cage tags in other classes of cgis is 7- and 11-fold smaller.

as it was already reported in  <cit>  cage tags tend to form dense clusters in 5' cgis. cgis located elsewhere contain much less cage tags than 5' cgis, but, interestingly, some intragenic, 3' or intergenic cgis contain clusters of cage tags with the number and the density of cage tags comparable with those found in cage clusters in 5' cgis. additional file  <dig> contains intragenic and 3' cgis that have greater than  <dig> cage tags per a cgi . 3' cgis usually contain more cage tags than intragenic cgis. in some sense this agrees with the tendency of cgis to overlap with the final coding exon rather than with internal exons.

not only 5'cgis, but also 3', intragenic and intergenic cgis are enriched with sp <dig> binding sites
authors of  <cit>  reported that cgis overlapping mouse promoters of housekeeping genes contained an increased number of binding sites for different transcription regulatory factors, in particular sp <dig>  ets, and nrf- <dig>  since binding of sp <dig> is well studied with experimental methods, we decided to assess sp <dig> binding in cgis of different localization relative to known genes. we used both bioinformatics methods of identification of sp <dig> recognition motifs in dna sequence as well as re-assessment of the published experimental data.

cgis were scanned for presence of sp <dig> factor binding sites using a positional weight matrix  constructed from experimental data from the transfac database. we selected a threshold that identified 90% of sp <dig> binding sequences from our experimentally confirmed training set . to evaluate the representation of sp <dig> binding sites in cgis, we calculated the p-value  for each cgi, i.e. the probability of a random sequence of the same length and the same dinucleotide content to contain at least this number of sp <dig> occurrences. this p-value was calculated with the help of the ahopro program  <cit> . we compared results obtained for different cgi classes.

it is noteworthy that cgis containing more than  <dig> cage tags contain a much more high scoring sp <dig> recognition motifs than cgis without evidence of high transcription activity , independently from their localization in relation to genes. surprisingly, the greatest overrepresentation of high-scoring sp <dig> recognition motifs sites is characteristic for 3' cgis with more than  <dig> cage tags, but not for 5' cgi enriched with cage.

chip-chip data indicate that sp <dig> factors tend to bind within cgis
for further validation of sp <dig> protein binding within cgis, data on sp <dig> transcription factor binding sites, experimentally assessed with chip-chip technology and published in  <cit>  were analyzed. cawley et al. detected frequent sp <dig> binding sites far from 5' regions of any gene. we used their data to justify that sp <dig> protein binds preferably within cpg islands regardless of their location in relation to genes.

sp <dig> binding regions published in  <cit>  are usually longer than  <dig> kb, which is significantly longer than many cgis, especially those located far from tss of genes. the authors of  <cit>  used an extensive filtration procedure, which can lead to a high false negative rate, to limit their results to binding sites frequently occupied with sp <dig>  therefore, the raw data were re-analyzed to allow comparison between chip signals within cgis and those in other dna segments. additionally chip signals within cgis located in different gene segments were examined.

since the difference between medians of hybridization signals for the input and the treated samples was in all cases very small we tested whether this difference was statistically significant using wilcoxon-mann-whitney test statistics. table  <dig> shows the p-values of the wilcoxon-mann-whitney test statistics calculated for the input and the treated samples for different classes of cgis. the test indicates that for all classes of cgis the distribution of signal values from the sp <dig> antibody treaded samples differ significantly  from the distribution of signal values of the corresponding control samples. in contrast the difference in non-cgi dna is not significant.

we also compared sp1/input ratios between different classes of cgis using wilcoxon-mann-whitney test statistics. table  <dig> shows that signal ratios from tags overlapping with cgis of all types are significantly different from those in non-cgi dna.

non-5' cgis with multiple cage tags are often associated with transcription starts sites of long rnas for which no encoded proteins are known
we have explored if there are known transcripts associated with non-5'-cgis enriched with cage tags. table  <dig> demonstrates that  <dig> of  <dig> 3' cgis containing more then  <dig> cage tags are associated with a start of at least one potential coding gene from ncbi reference sequences . the corresponding value for intergenic cgis is only  <dig> from  <dig>  other  <dig> of  <dig> 3' cgis and  <dig> of  <dig> intergenic cgis also overlap with starts of long transcripts but without any evidence of a coded protein or at least a long orf. to be exact,  <dig> 3' cgis and  <dig> intergenic cgis contain start sites of mrnas recorded in genebank. it should be mentioned that not all mrnas in genebank are confirmed to code any protein; sometimes such rnas only demonstrate mrna properties, like having cap, polya-tail or splicing. therefore the mrna database from genebank is likely to contain a fraction of long potentially non-coding rnas. the remaining  <dig> 3'cgis and  <dig> intergenic cgis contain start sites of spliced or unspliced ests. for cgis containing from  <dig> to  <dig> cage tags the situation changes dramatically. in this case  <dig> of  <dig> 3' cgis contain starts of known long rnas with no demonstrated protein-coding activity, whereas only  <dig> 3'cgis contain starts of protein-coding genes maintained in the refseq database. from all intragenic cgis with 20- <dig> cage tags only  <dig> contains a start of a protein-coding gene and other  <dig> contain starts of mrnas  and ests. thus, a substantial fraction of cage-enriched non 5'cgis contains tsss of long rna showing no evidence of any encoded protein; this is especially true for cgis with 20- <dig> cage tags.

number of transcript starts in intragenic and 3' cgis having more than  <dig> cage tags per a cgi.

the total number of 3' and intragenic cgi with more then  <dig> cage tags is rather small:  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. decreasing the threshold for cage tags per cgi to 20- <dig> leads to  <dig> 3' cgi and  <dig> intragenic cgis. however, the number of highly cage-enriched non 5' cgis is not large enough to render a convincing statistical significance value.

discussion
in this study we tried to systematically assess properties of cpg islands that are found far from transcription start sites of protein coding genes. about 43% of all cgis belong to this class. our study of cgis which overlap with exons demonstrates that stabilizing selection protects cpg pairs located in cgis from substitutions which do not affect the encoded amino acid sequence. we observed that many cgis that are found far from tss overlap with cage tags and thus participate in transcription; furthermore, highly cage-enriched cgis are bound by transcription regulatory factor sp <dig> with remarkably high significance. although function of cgis is still disputed, there is growing evidence that cgis located near gene starts participate in transcription regulation  <cit> . our finding allowed us to suggest that many cgis that are found far from the start of any known protein coding gene are also participate in transcription.

as we have demonstrated, many such cgis often overlap with exons, particularly the terminal gene exons. many cgis are located within a gene but far downstream from tss . the aggregated number of genes with cgis near their 3' end is estimated at  <dig> - 10%. interestingly, it was observed recently  <cit>  that some genes in human t-cells have an uncommon methylation pattern with a decreased methylation level observed near both gene termini.

we have detected many intergenic cgis . it is known that ucsc browser table knowngenes contains only highly verified genes, and excludes some genes with low justification scores. based on our analysis, some cgis considered in this study as intergenic may be related to these yet unverified genes.

cgis located far downstream from tss protect synonymous codon positions from substitutions very similar as do cgis located near gene starts. a cgi is thought to reduce the cpg mutation rate by protecting dna from methylation. on the other hand, cgis probably contain many binding sites for transcription factors that overlap cpg dinucleotides  <cit> . such binding can also increase conservation of cpg dinucleotides by applying stabilizing selection at nucleotide level that preserves functional binding sites. the decreased mutation rate and the purifying selective pressure would contribute to reduction of the substitution rate in cpg dinucleotides within cgis . this probably explains why the synonymous substitution rate in cpg containing codons in exon segments overlapping with cgis becomes lower than that in exons not overlapping with cgis. this effect is observed in all gene regions, 5' as well as 3' or intragenic, which supports the functional role of cgis located in regions other than gene 5'.

the selection directed to maintain cgi sequence properties is not strong enough to overcome a strong selection at protein level applied to non-synonymous substitutions. the non-synonymous substitution rate differs only weakly for codons overlapping and non-overlapping with cgis. however, the dn/ds ratio for cpg containing codons not overlapping with cgis is much smaller than for codons overlapping with cgis. this fact indicates that in this case selection at the protein level needs to be stronger to counterbalance the higher mutation rate.

the evolutionary distance between human and mouse is rather large, with the approximate sequence divergence for these species close to  <dig>  substitutions for a neutrally evolving site  <cit> . this value agrees very well with the ds values observed for codons that do not contain cpg. however, ds values for cpg containing codons are about twice as large as those for other codons. this is much less than the approximate ten-fold increase of mutation rate  <cit> . the possible explanation may come from the effect suggested by kondrashov et. al.  <cit> . the idea is that hypermutable cpg dinucleotides  <cit>  at neutral and pseudoneutral sites are likely to be destroyed by mutations and unlikely to be found in the alignment of human and mouse  <cit> . those cpg dinucleotides that remain aligned in human and mouse genomes are likely to be stabilized by selection pressure of a different nature. thus, even cpg dinucleotides that do not overlap with cpg islands at synonymous positions may be stabilized with some selection of yet unknown type. interestingly, bock et al  <cit>  who specifically identified cgis related to chromatin epigenetic state observed that about 90% of such islands overlapped with highly conserved dna elements, including at least 20% of cgis that did not overlap with tss.

although cgi overlap with disproportionally large number of cage tags  many intragenic, intergenic, and gene terminal cgis overlap with a small number of cage tags or with no cage tags at all. however, we believe, that fantom database can have some functional transcription starts missing.

first, cage tags were mapped at the repeat-masked human genome, thus excluding so-called "gc-rich low-complexity regions" and simple repeats such as n. many cgis contain such low complexity regions, and cage tags in these regions were excluded from our analysis. it is important to note that even a simple repeat such as n can probably operate as functional sp <dig> site , and thus may play a role in cgi functioning. it is noteworthy that many computationally identified cgis overlap with alu repeats  <cit> , therefore we did not filter out such cgis, considering that they would only reduce the effect but not create an artifact.

second, cage tags found in fantom database are obtained only in a number of tissues. cgis located in 5' gene regions are usually found at starts of broadly expressed housekeeping genes  <cit> . transcripts from tss tagged in 3' regions of known genes could be tissue specific. since the number of tissues studied is limited, the number of tagged tss should be less than that in 5' gene regions.

the suggested role of non-5' cgis in transcription initiation agrees with the excessive sp <dig> binding in cgis. the observation that sp <dig> binding sites are often present in cgis is not new  <cit> . it is noteworthy that cgis enriched with cage tags contain more high-scoring sp <dig> recognition motifs . abundant sp <dig> binding in gene 3' or intergenic regions was observed in genome-wide site location experiments  <cit> , which reported that 36% of the clusters of sp <dig>  myc and p <dig> binding sites lie within or immediately 3' to well-characterized genes. authors of  <cit>  assumed that in these cases, non-coding rna transcription may be initiated.

recent studies of the mouse genome  <cit>  demonstrated that a large number of ncrna are initiated in the 3' regions of the genes, with specific enrichment at the 3' terminus of the final exon. there are published reports which show that sometimes long ncrna are synthesized to open large chromatin segments for subsequent transcription initiation  <cit> . on the other hand a substantial number of these ncrnas are complementary to known genes as anti-sense strands, which has led to the suggestion of an additional mechanism of gene silencing by natural antisense interference  <cit> . the authors of  <cit>  also observed that sense-antisense pairing was almost universally associated with candidate imprinted loci. as genetic imprinting is frequently associated with an altered methylation status of cpg islands  <cit> , cgis located in 3' gene regions  <cit>  or intragenic cgis  <cit>  may play an important role in this process by regulation of gene expression via inducing antisense-based gene interference.

CONCLUSIONS
abundant non-coding transcripts discovered recently in all parts of a genome allow suggesting that there should be regulatory regions associated with transcription initiation of such rna types. this agrees with a large number of cgis not associated with transcription start site of any known protein coding gene. here we demonstrate that many of such cgis appear to be related to transcription initiation and at least some of them contain cpg pairs stabilized by natural selection. expression of rna controlled by promoters overlapping with these cgis seems to be regulated by the same transcription factors as expression of protein coding genes, therefore these rna molecules seem to be involved into the regulatory cascades and cellular processes possibly as non-coding rna of some function. additional studies, both experimental and in silico are needed to verify this hypothesis.
