BACKGROUND
identification of genes under selection is a major goal in the study of domestication in animals  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . the process of domestication, accompanied by selection on traits related to yield, morphology, fertility and survival during captive breeding, is believed to have dramatically affected the frequency of alleles segregating among domesticated breeds  <cit> . mutations conferring new favorable phenotypes will be subject to a ‘selective sweep’, a rapid increase in allele frequency by artificial selection. breeds affected by such sweeps will harbor large genetic differences with other breeds and carry signatures of selection in the genomic regions involved  <cit> .

recent genome-wide scans in diverse breeds aimed to uncover the genetic basis for phenotypic variation in pigs  <cit>  showed that selection mapping approaches can detect comprehensive signatures of intense artificial selection that have led to the formation of well-defined breeds, suggesting that domestic animals can serve as models for deciphering complex phenotype-genotype association through selection mapping  <cit> . previous studies suggested that european and asian pigs were derived from multiple independent domestication events  <cit> , notably from european and asian subspecies of wild boars that are estimated to have split about ~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> , followed by the occurrence of introgression of asian pigs into some european breeds during the neolithic  <cit>  and 18th-19th centuries  <cit> . although the demographic history of pig domestication is highly complicated, recent studies have identified candidate genes with distinct patterns of differentiation underlying the phenotypic diversity of breeds  <cit> , suggesting that the breed formation results in fixation of genetically differentiated gene pools within the regions under the artificial selection exercised by breeders.

to access a comprehensive analysis of genetic variations underlying domestication traits in the well-established pig breeds , we focused on investigating highly distinct patterns in genes under the artificial selection by two different approaches: an fst-based approach that detects directional diversifying selection  <cit>  and a haplotype-based test that detects very recent selective sweeps within breeds  <cit> . the fst-based statistic detects strong shifts in allele frequencies to a fixed difference between local populations. the signatures detected here are likely to capture directional selection that occurred during or shortly after the establishment of the respective breeds  <cit> . and, the haplotype-based statistic detects a rapid rise of a selected allele to an intermediate frequency during which the long-range of haplotype association is not eliminated by recombination  <cit> . these signatures are likely to capture positive selection for variants that occurred after the separation between the european and asian pigs, and where the alleles have not reached fixation in european breeds. our previous study on the phylogenetic diversity of the asian wild boar and european breeds showed that the korean wild boars can serve as a distinctive outgroup to differentiate european breed-specific genetic variations during domestication  <cit> . growing evidence suggests that the sweeps and directional selection are associated with quantitative traits in domesticated animals, like pigs  <cit> , chickens  <cit> , cattle  <cit> , and dogs  <cit> .

in this study, we applied both methods to whole genomes of two major domesticated breeds, landrace and yorkshire, using asian wild boars as an outgroup. distinct patterns of selection signatures were found at loci that may contribute to domestication phenotypes, including behavior. we further annotated candidates of artificial selection with our studies and those in previous qtl mapping studies. we suggest that signatures of distinct patterns of genetic variation detected here are valuable resources to integrate qtl information and genetic candidates into our understanding of the phenotypic variation in pig domestication.

RESULTS
population structure
we resequenced the whole genomes of yorkshire , landrace , and asian wild boar  at an average depth  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. first, we examined the genetic diversity  in the genomes. π was significantly lower  for yorkshire and landrace  than that of wild boar , reflecting a possible genetic bottleneck or founder effect in domesticated breeds. next, to examine the population structure among breeds, we analyzed snp genotype frequencies with admixture  <cit>  and performed a multidimensional scaling  analysis using plink  <cit> . the mds analysis indicates the partitioning between european pigs from asian wild boars on the first two pc axes. pc <dig> depicts the asian wild boars versus european pig axis, and pc <dig> represented the genetic difference between european breeds . admixture recapitulated the partitioning of the asian wild boar and the european domesticated lineages for varying numbers of ancestral populations  . thus, genome-wide scans for signatures of diversifying selection relative to asian boars would detect the loci of directional selection in the european domesticated breeds.figure  <dig>

low haplotype diversity in domesticated pigs
upon visual inspection of phased sequence alignments, we noticed that yorkshire and landrace genomes are enriched for large clusters of snps in strong linkage disequilibrium . such haplotype structure is captured by the distribution of the number of distinct haplotypes, h, in a sliding window of  <dig> consecutive snps within each population. figure  <dig> shows that a large number of windows exhibit complete linkage disequilibrium with only a few distinct haplotypes . we tested if simple demographic structure can explain such patterns of haplotypes, by constructing a simple demographic model for the three populations resulting from two population splits, the first at the foundation of an ancestral domesticated lineage and the second at the formation of the two breeds . we assume a constant migration rate between breeds after the populations split. after obtaining the best-fit parameters of the model, we generated data by neutral coalescent simulation under the inferred demography. we find that the extremely low haplotype diversity observed in yorkshire and landrace is not generated by the simulation even when a recombination rate of zero is used .figure  <dig>

h is measured by counting the number of unique haplotypes for bins with  <dig> variable sites within each breed. a neutral simulation without recombination under the inferred wild boar/yorkshire/landrance demography was carried out to compare the distribution of the observed h and that of simulated h. red vertical line depicts a part of observed h showing complete linkage disequilibrium with only a few distinct haplotypes in the pig genome.



to account for this low haplotype diversity in domestic breeds, we examined if our data set violated the assumption of random sampling of unrelated individuals, by testing potential family structure in our samples that may arise due to modern breeding practices. we used relateadmix  <cit>  and confirmed that our sampled individuals are indeed unrelated ; additional file 1: figure s1). a plausible explanation might be recent admixture that occurred during the complicated breeding history of these breeds, in which crosses are made between genetically divergent breeds that also experienced severe genetic bottlenecks. under this perspective, a complex demographic model, incorporating multiple independent derivations of domesticated populations from wild boar followed by inbreeding and recent admixture among them, is likely needed to account for the observed low haplotype diversity  <cit> . thus, instead of using a model-based approach, which involves inferring complex demographic parameters for domesticated pigs to approximate the null distribution, we followed an outlier approach to identify candidate genes under selection by taking 99th percentile of the empirical distribution. this approach has been shown to be useful in studying such samples as domesticated populations  <cit> .

mapping selective sweep in the domesticated pig breeds
we scanned the signatures of selection that is predicted to alter allele frequencies and haplotype structure within domesticated population. first, genome-wide pbs was calculated for a sliding window of  <dig> consecutive snps in landrace and yorkshire populations using wild boar as an out-group population, for detecting lineage specific reduction of allele frequencies. there is a negative relationship between pbs and the nucleotide diversity of domesticated lineages relative to wild boar , indicating, as expected, that the signal of selection is most pronounced where nucleotide diversity is reduced in the domesticated lineage. next, genome-wide integrated haplotype score  was calculated to detect long-range haplotype structure associated with directional selection  <cit> . because the ihs has its maximal power when selected alleles segregate at intermediate frequency, we limited eligible snps to those with maf >  <dig>  in each breed. high ihs values are evidence for ongoing directional selection that rapidly increase the selected allele frequency along with longer haplotype background of the selected alleles than that of the alternative allele. .

as our primary goal is to identify putative candidate genes involved in pig domestication , we only considered bins/sites yielding large values of pbs/ihs located in the genic regions of the genome for further analyses, where a genic region is defined as one of the  <dig>  reference genes in the reference pig genome. by sorting genes by the strength of signal mapped to them, we identified the top  <dig> candidate genes that were deemed as outlier values at 99th percentile of all genes  for each combination of breed and detection method. strong between- and/or within-population differentiation of haplotypes indicative of local or partial selective sweeps are observed in the alignment of variable sites in candidate genes harboring the strongest signals . the clarity of such patterns is expected to diminish as the magnitude of selection signal decreases. however, even for candidates ranked at the bottom of the list of each test, we could still observe the qualitative patterns of directional selection, e.g., reduced diversity and/or increased haplotype homozygosity . thirty-one genes are found in common between the lists of candidates detected by ihs in yorkshire and landrace , which is a statistically significant overlap . however, such significant between-breed sharing is not observed among candidates detected by pbs, presumably because the method detects breed specific selection.figure  <dig>

selective sweep mapping associated with quantitative traits loci in pig
for genes with putative signatures of directional selection, we investigated how many of them overlap with previously identified quantitative trait loci . we sought to annotate their potential roles in the process of domestication-related phenotypes rather than their broad functional terms in go categories. for various trait categories, we identified qtl candidate genes as those located within the qtl-intervals on the genetic maps archived in the animalqtl database  <cit> . the sum of qtl intervals for a given trait sub-category covers 5 ~ 8% of the reference genes. in total,  <dig>  genes were associated with one or more quantitative traits. by using pbs ,  <dig> and  <dig> selection candidates identified in yorkshire and landrace, respectively, also overlap with qtl-candidate loci, which represent statistically significant overlaps . by using the ihs method ,  <dig> and  <dig> candidate genes identified in yorkshire and landrace are also overlapping with qtl-candidate loci , respectively. we also observe a large proportion of overlap between selection candidates detected by both pbs and ihs methods and qtl candidates identified from previously published association studies : out of the total  <dig> selection candidate genes in yorkshire,  <dig>  genes are qtl-candidate genes . out of the total  <dig> selection candidate genes in landrace,  <dig>  genes are qtl-candidate genes . the overlap remains significant when method-specific selection candidates and qtl candidates are examined .

when the qtls are divided into four trait categories, selection candidate genes have a significant overlap with qtl candidates in the ‘reproduction’ and ‘exterior’ categories . using the pbs method,  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  detected in yorkshire and landrace, respectively, are ‘reproduction’ qtl candidate genes. however, we do not observe such enrichment of selection candidates by pbs or ihs in the ‘production’ qtls. using the ihs method,  <dig> genes  and  <dig> genes  detected in yorkshire and landrace, respectively, are ‘exterior’ qtl candidate genes . in total,  <dig> sub-categories of quantitative traits significantly  overlapped with putative candidate genes under strong artificial selection . the top five strong selection genes associated with qtls in both yorkshire and landrace, in yorkshire alone, and in landrace alone are listed in additional file  <dig>   <dig>  16: tables s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  respectively. in ‘reproduction’ categories, genes assigned to ‘total number of born alive’  are particularly interesting, as these are clustered on chromosome  <dig> . this cluster might reflect that these common candidate genes play a crucial role in the domestication-related phenotypes, and, thus are under strong artificial selection during pig domestication.figure  <dig> 
distribution of selection signals associated with reproduction. population-specific allele frequency change  and integrated haplotype score  for european breeds show similar patterns of selection at reproduction qtl and non-qtl. tnba  and mp  entries are separated from the reproduction qtl category to distinguish potential effects of artificial selection on genes associated with specific measures of reproductive performance. average pbs in tnba is significantly higher  compared to those in other traits.



it is quite possible that many genes subject to artificial selection during domestication could not be detected by qtl mapping because the phenotypes of many traits, e.g. immune/defense processes and behavior, cannot be easily scored or typed for qtl/association studies. in fact, a functional enrichment analysis shows that strong selection candidates involved with signal transduction  and neuronal activities . one of these genes exhibiting the strongest ihs in yorkshire, grm <dig>  was not detected by qtl studies . there is prior evidences that grm <dig> impact specific brain function associated with spatial learning, memory, understanding of speech, and autism in humans  <cit> . along with grm <dig>  which is also rated high in both in landrace  and yorkshire  but does not overlap with qtls, grm <dig> constitutes the group iii metabotropic glutamate receptors , which inhibit neutrotransmitter release at the majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian central nervous system  <cit> . it is to note that no nonsynonymous mutation in these genes was observed neither in yorkshire nor landrace, likely indicating that strong selection detected in domesticated breeds might act on the regulatory region of these genes.figure  <dig>

discussion
to detect recent selective sweeps, we used two complementary methods . both methods have power primarily to detect candidates of recent domestication events but of different types of selection. both approaches are necessary in order to map the comprehensive footprint of selection in the genome and to construct a comprehensive selection map for the pig genome.

both selective sweep mapping and qtl mapping have potential to detect genes under artificial selection during domestication. however, each approach has its own limit: the former may be affected by directional selection not related to domestication and does not inform us about the phenotype under selection. the latter may map loci of phenotypes that are not targets of domestication selection, for example phenotypic differences caused by transient  mutations, and is unable to study phenotypes that cannot be clearly scored in a controlled environment. this study demonstrated the advantage of combining these two approaches and reveals a list of genes with clear contribution to domestication processes.

genetic variants underlying artificial selection during domestication
putative signatures of selection can be considered as candidates for the development of domesticated pig breeds with well-defined traits over the past hundreds of years. a number of regions showing strong selection have been identified in previous studies  <cit> .

a consequence of 300 years of artificial selection in europe and the usa for enhancing faster growth under high-calorie uptake,  <dig> positively selected genes  out of  <dig>  orthologs were found by an increased ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions shared in the duroc genome and tibetan wild boar compared to human, showing psgs are enriched in the focal adhesion, muscle growth, and energy metabolism  <cit> . we found  <dig> genes identified in this study to overlap with those psgs , and five of them, including ablim <dig>  cxadr, insr, rims <dig>  and syne <dig>  to be related with regulation of developmental growth and anatomic structural development. for example, cxadr, identified in yorkshire, encodes a protein involved with component of the epithelial apical junction complex that is essential for the tight junction integrity. insr identified in landrace is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates an increase of glucose uptake activated by insulin.table  <dig>

moreover, we showed that  <dig> genes identified in this study overlap with the ‘domestication’ genes identified in previous studies  <cit>  . four of them, including bai <dig>  pkp <dig>  ppfia <dig>  and pcdhac <dig>  are associated with cell adhesion, and, five of them, including lims <dig>  bai <dig>  cntfr, pkp <dig>  and pcdhac <dig>  are associated with signal transduction  <cit> . of these genes, cntfr provides an interesting evolutionary link between neuronal process and domestication. this gene encodes a member of the type  <dig> cytokine receptor family, which plays a critical role in neuronal cell survival, and may be associated with muscle strength and eating disorders  <cit> . along with strongest sweep signals at grm <dig> on ssc <dig> and grm <dig> on ssc <dig>  selection on those genes would provide the molecular evidence about the underlying mechanism involved in the alteration of the behavior phenotype during pig domestication.

it is to note that the highest signal of selection at  <dig>  mb on the ssc <dig> was identified in a previous study  <cit> , suggesting ghrl  as a putative candidate under selection. we found no window around the locus was ranked within 1% of pbs bins. instead we found that the locus at  <dig>  mb was ranked as  <dig> th, top  <dig> % of 7 m snps, by the ihs method. this observation can explain why ghrl was not identified in our study. the whole genome resequencing technology made it possible to detect a high level of novel genetic variation at high resolution where commercial probe-based snp array platforms have a certain bias in probing snps with minor allele frequency around  <dig>   <cit> . although those alleles with intermediate frequency are valuable resources for association studies and phylogenetic studies, they can have limited information of recent history of breed formation. as a result, the fst statistic averaged over all pairs of comparisons among  <dig> european breeds may be inappropriate to capture genetic variation that is fixed by directional positive selection. in fact, ghrl is located within the region showing strong signals of ihs. in this study, the high-resolution map of selective sweeps identified by using both pbs and ihs provides a comprehensive picture of genetic variation underlying pig domestication.

additionally, out of  <dig> candidate loci involved in white coat color detected in a previous study  <cit> , eight genes overlapped with this study. five of these overlapping genes, including dnajb <dig>  isoc <dig>  mettl <dig>  pprc <dig>  and rbbp <dig>  are related with metabolic processes  <cit> . but, we found no overlap between genes in the contrast of belted and non-belted pigs  <cit> .

selection on group iii mglur for tame behavior in domesticated breeds
by identifying genes harboring strong signals of directional selection, a new set of genes to be functionally validated beyond the list of qtls were obtained. one of the most striking findings is a strong signal of artificial selection in grm <dig> and grm <dig>  these genes are included in the mglu group iii receptors that are linked to the inhibition of cyclic amp cascade. in dogs, grm <dig> was detected to be positively selected using the method of identifying high divergence between indigenous dogs and wolves  <cit> . in mice, the knockdown of grm <dig> receptor mrna levels reduced anxiety-associated behaviors, including stress levels and fear  <cit> . we suggest that selection on genetic variation in the mglu iii receptors might have played a critical role in the process of domestication that converts anxiety-associated aggressive behaviors of wild population to tame behaviors for the adaptation to the community. in fact, tail biting, a stress-induced behavior, is one of the most important issues in welfare of pigs. tail biting has been observed in ~30% of european pigs, where the yorkshire pigs are more likely to be victims of tail biting than landrace pigs  <cit> . further study is necessary to characterize the role of these genes in specific behavior of pigs.

artificial selection on the formation of pig breeds
it is well known that the european breeds have been domesticated from european wild boars followed by introgression in the 18-19th century of asian haplotypes, which were derived from asian domesticated breeds that have their origin in the asian wild boar  <cit> . the main cause of introgression was the effort to introduce asian-specific traits, i.e., production efficiency, into european breeds. our analysis could also detect these asian haplotypes, which resemble those seen in asian wild boars, segregating in the european breeds by the ihs method. out of  <dig> introgressed loci identified in a previous study  <cit> , six genes overlapped in this study . znf <dig> is the most interesting candidate to note in that this gene encodes a nucleoplasimic protein associated with early regulator of adipogenesis that works as a transcription cofactor of cebps, controlling the expression of pparg, and other proadipogenic genes  <cit> . this gene might shed light on what sort of genes were introgressed, and selected during domestication of european pigs. as asian wild boars were used as an out-group population in our analysis, european-specific selection signals involving introgression could be pronounced. therefore, introgression and admixture among breeds has contributed the structure of the genomes of domesticated breeds. thus, caution is needed for interpreting significance of selection candidates, particularly for methods using haplotype structure.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study the identification of putative sweeps based on high-depth whole genome ngs helps build an understanding of the effects of artificial selection during the process of animal domestication. future studies are needed to fully characterize the process of complex admixture and introgression between pigs of different ancestry. to this end, a world-wide sampling of native breeds and wild boar genomes would be needed.
