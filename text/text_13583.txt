BACKGROUND
mouse blastocysts at e <dig>  consist of three cell types: epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm. the epiblast is composed of pluripotent cells that give rise to all embryonic lineages in later developmental stages  <cit> . in contrast, both primitive endoderm and trophectoderm form extra-embryonic parts such as the yolk sac and placenta, respectively. primitive endoderm differentiates into two types of endoderm after implantation. one is the parietal endoderm  that migrates along the mural trophectoderm and covers its inner surface to form the reichert membrane. the other is the visceral endoderm  that covers the outer surface of epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm derived from trophectoderm. pe cells show mesenchymal cell-like characteristics such as stellate morphology, weak cell adhesion and rapid migration ability. in contrast, ve cells show typical epithelial morphology with tight cell adhesion.

transcription factors  have pivotal roles in determining cell fates in developmental processes. in pre-implantation embryos, the gata family zinc-finger transcription factor, gata <dig>  appears to be the primary tf that determines primitive endoderm fate as it is expressed at the earliest time point   <cit>  among the primitive endoderm-specific tfs, and gata6-null embryos fail to form functional visceral endoderm  <cit> . in addition, recent reports showed that gata <dig> deficient blastocyst-stage embryos fail to form primitive endoderm before implantation  <cit> . the family member gata <dig> is co-expressed in the primitive endoderm  <cit>  and possibly shares function with gata <dig>  gata4-null embryos die around e <dig>  with both primitive and definitive endoderm and heart defects  <cit> . however, chimeric complementation of the extraembryonic lineage with wild type cells, allows contribution of gata4-null es cells to cardiac and definitive endoderm cell lineages without abnormality  <cit> , suggesting that its importance in proper extraembryonic endoderm development is limited. in addition, the involvement of the group f sox family members, sox <dig> and sox <dig>  is suggested by their expression in the primitive endoderm  <cit>  as well as the inability to derive extraembryonic endoderm  stem cells from sox17-null blastocysts  <cit> . sox17-null embryos show a defect in the primitive endoderm lineage only in the diapause situation  <cit> . these findings suggest that their roles are not in the formation, but rather the maturation to pe and ve. sox7-null embryos have recently been reported to have a lethality phenotype before e <dig>  with heart development failure  <cit> , further suggesting a redundant role in primitive endoderm development. detailed analyses of the expression patterns of these four transcription factors in wild-type and mutant embryos supports a model of sequential gata6 → sox17 → gata4 → sox <dig> transcription factor activation within the primitive endoderm lineage  <cit> , although the precise function of sox <dig> in this process is unclear.

in addition to xen cells, embryonic stem  cells derived from pre-implantation stage epiblast provide a powerful tool to analyze the functions of transcription factors in determining cell fates. we have previously reported that forced expression of either gata <dig> or gata <dig> in es cells triggers their differentiation to primitive endoderm cells that exhibit the characteristics of xen cells in their morphology, gene expression patterns and their ability to contribute to pe after blastocyst injection  <cit> . shimoda et al. reported that over-expression of sox <dig> in es cells was not able to induce differentiation but rather facilitated the differentiation of the primitive endoderm that spontaneously differentiated toward pe and ve cells on the surface of an es cell aggregate, embryoid body .  <cit> . they also reported that sox17-null es cells showed a defect in maturation of pe and ve in ebs, suggesting a role for sox <dig> in late stages of extraembryonic endoderm development. a similar defect was observed in ebs made with gata4-null es cells  <cit> . therefore, in vitro differentiation systems of es cells are regarded as good models of primitive endoderm differentiation, and allow the assessment of the gene function involving in the process  <cit> .

here we report the function of sox <dig> in the context of differentiation of primitive endoderm cells derived from es cells. we find that inducible expression of sox <dig> causes marginal differentiation of es cells towards primitive endoderm, and that sox7-null es cells normally generate primitive endoderm cells in ebs and differentiate to xen cells by the activation of gata <dig>  these results indicate that sox <dig> function is not essential for either differentiation to primitive endoderm or for maturation to pe or ve.

RESULTS
parallel up-regulation of sox <dig>  sox <dig> and gata <dig> is triggered by the artificial activation of gata <dig> in es cells
we previously reported that artificial induction of gata <dig> transcriptional activity using a chimeric transgene composed of full-length mouse gata <dig> and human glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain , induces homogeneous differentiation of mouse es cells into xen-like cells when their nuclear localization is induced with dexamethasone   <cit> . to investigate the sequential activation of other tfs expressed in the primitive endoderm during mouse development, we first performed qpcr analysis along the time-course of differentiation after addition of dex to the medium. sox <dig> and sox <dig>  as well as the endogenous gata <dig>  started to be up-regulated within 2 hours after addition of dex while gata <dig> remained at the basal level . at 24 hours after the addition of dex, all  <dig> of these tfs were dramatically up-regulated as well as other tfs such as hnf3b/foxa <dig> and snail . these data suggested that both sox <dig> and sox <dig> could be direct targets of gata <dig> in mediating its function of triggering differentiation toward primitive endoderm.fig.  <dig> up-regulation of extraembryonic endoderm-associated transcription factor genes after induction of gata6gr. the expression levels of extraembryonic endoderm-associated transcription factor genes were estimated by qpcr analysis in 5g6gr es cells carrying gata6gr after dex treatment and the relative expression levels normalized by gapdh were shown along the time course. the level of expression of each transcript in eb <dig> es cells cultured without lif for 120 hours was set at  <dig> . error bars indicate standard deviation 



forced expression of sox <dig> in es cells shows marginal impact on differentiation to xen-like cells
since the assessment of the effect of overexpression of sox <dig> in mouse es cells has been reported by several groupes , here we focused on the function of sox <dig>  we applied a tetracycline -inducible gene expression system with cre-mediated cassette-exchange  <cit> , the rosa-tet system, for the induction of sox <dig> transgene in es cells. we previously confirmed that this system provides a moderate level of homogeneous transgene expression from the gt26sor locus upon withdrawal of tc, which was sufficient for gata <dig> to induce differentiation to the primitive endoderm  <cit> . as a result, we found that sox <dig> over-expression using this system cannot make es cells differentiate completely . despite the total expression level of sox <dig> being about ten times higher than that of embryo derived xen cells, these cells do not express comparable amount of primitive endoderm-associated tfs such as gata <dig>  gata <dig>  sox <dig> and foxa <dig>  and maintain the expression levels of pluripotency-associated genes  at high levels . these data indicate that the impact of sox <dig> overexpression in driving the primitive endoderm differentiation program is quite marginal, that is much weaker than gata <dig> fig.  <dig> effect of sox <dig> overexpression in es cells.  es cells carrying tetracycline-inducible sox <dig> transgene at the modified rosa <dig> locus are cultured for 4 days with  or without  tetracycline in the presence of lif. scale bar = 200 μm.  qpcr analysis of day  <dig> sox <dig> expressing cells. results are relative expression level to embryo-derived xen cells and normalised to gapdh. two independent experiments by different clones  are shown. error bar represents standard deviation from triplicates



sox <dig> is not essential for the generation of primitive endoderm in es cells
gain-of-function analysis of sox <dig> in es cells suggested that it has a marginal impact on determining primitive endoderm fate compared to gata <dig>  to test whether it plays a physiological role in this process, we generated a sox7-null es cell line by gene targeting. the targeting vector was designed to remove the entire coding sequence spanning two exons. the first allele knockout clone was generated by the introduction of sox <dig> ko vector into eb <dig> es cells followed by genotyping using southern blot . then one heterozygous clone, termed s7mt <dig>  was selected with a high-dose of puromycin to obtain homozygous cells by a spontaneous gene conversion event  <cit>  . as a result, we successfully established two sox7-null es cell lines .fig.  <dig> generation of sox7-null es cells.  design of the gene targeting vector. sox <dig> coding region including exon  <dig> and  <dig> were replace by pgk-pac∆tk casette flanked by loxp and lox <dig>   correctly targeted clone  was confirmed by southern blot.  genotyping results of high dose puromycin resistant clones by southern blot. first five lanes are clones from s7mtg <dig> line  and last three lanes are from s7mt <dig> line. we obtained three null lines from five s7mtg <dig> high dose puromycin resistance clones and two from six s7mt <dig> derivatives 



these sox7-null es cells were morphologically normal and continued self-renewal in a manner similar to the parental eb <dig> es cells. we then tested their ability to differentiate to extraembryonic endoderm by embryoid body  formation assay. the ebs generated in a hanging drop culture of sox7-null es cells for 5 days were morphologically similar to those of parental es cells and possessed the extra-embryonic endoderm layer at the surface . next, we measured the expression of marker genes in these ebs by qpcr. during differentiation, sox <dig> was up-regulated in ebs derived from heterozygous s7mt <dig>  but not in those derived from sox7-null es cells, s7n <dig> and s7n <dig> , confirming loss of sox <dig> in these mutant cell lines. when the expression levels of ve and pe marker genes were tested in these ebs, we found that all of them were properly expressed in ebs from sox7-null es cells at day  <dig>  as they were in ebs from eb <dig> es cells, indicating normal generation of pe and ve in the absence of sox <dig> . next, we assessed the proportion of ve by facs analysis for cell surface markers  that are expressed in ve but not in definitive endoderm  <cit> . we found that the proportion of the double positive fraction of dpp <dig> and epcam cells was similar in ebs of sox7-null es cells . we then collected this double positive fraction and analyzed the marker gene expression pattern. as shown in fig. 4l, the expression level of the extraembryonic endoderm markers that we examined  were not affected in both genotypes. these data show that the extraembryonic endoderm differentiation was almost completely unaffected by the deletion of sox <dig> fig.  <dig> differentiation of sox7-null es cells by eb formation.  gross morphology of ebs at day  <dig> in each genotype indicated. scale bar in c is 200 μm.  ebs in  were sectioned and stained with hematoxilyn and eosin. scale bars are 100 μm.  time course qpcr analysis of sox <dig> expression in sox7-null clones  and their parental heterozygote line  duirng eb formation. the relative expression levels normalized to gapdh were shown with the error bar for standard deviation .  qpcr analysis of gene expression in ebs at day  <dig>  the relative expression levels normalized to gapdh were shown with the error bar for standard deviation . ve genes are marked in orange and pe genes are marked in blue.  ve fractions of ebs at day  <dig> were analyzed by facs. dead cells were eliminated by pi staining and living cells were separated by the staining with anti epcam-pe and anti dppiv-apc. double-positive fraction was indicated with its proportion .  qpcr analysis of ve fractions collected by facs. relative expression levels to s7mt <dig> parental line are presented. expression levels were normalized to gapdh with the error bar for standard deviation

sox7-null es cells can differentiate into xen-like cells
as we showed above, sox <dig> is quickly up-regulated by the activation of g6gr in es cells . to test the function of sox <dig> in gata6-induced differentiation toward xen-like cells, we firstly introduced the g6gr expression cassette into s7mt <dig>  line  and obtained sox7-null es cells from this parental line by high-dose puromycin selection . when these es cells were cultured with dex, they differentiated into xen-like cells as efficiently as the parental s7mtg <dig> es cells . western blot analysis confirmed the proper induction of sox <dig>  gata <dig> and gata <dig> without sox <dig> in these xen-like cells . therefore, the morphological differentiation to primitive endoderm triggered by gata <dig> does not require the function of sox <dig> 

sox <dig> is not required for induction of primitive endoderm-specific gene expression profile by gata6
to clarify the gene expression profile of sox7-null xen-like cells, we performed dna microarray analysis. the results were analysed using the nia array analysis tool  <cit> . firstly, we identified differentially expressed genes  before and after dex treatment in sox <dig>  cells carrying gata6gr  . then, these genes were analysed in sox <dig>  cells carrying gata6gr  to examine the differences . comparison of  <dig> probes upregulated in sox <dig>  confirmed that  <dig>  % of them  were also up-regulated in sox <dig>  cells. this includes important tfs such as gata <dig>  foxa <dig> and sox <dig> as well as extraembryonic-endoderm genes such as fst, sprac and thbd . however,  <dig>  % of the probes  which were highly expressed in sox <dig>  xen-like compared to es cells were not enriched in sox <dig>  xen-like cells  and only  <dig>  % of down-regulated probes  in sox <dig>  overlapped with sox <dig>  . this suggests that loss of sox <dig> has little effect on the induction of extraembryonic endoderm genes, but its loss affects the magnitude of the down-regulation of es-associated genes or hyper induction of extraembryonic endoderm-associated genes in this process.fig.  <dig> microarray analysis of xen-like cells with or without sox <dig>   scatter plots showing gene expression of es cells  and xen-like cells . the value is mean of log intensity from three replicates. probes more than  <dig> fold change with fdr <  <dig>  are shown.  venn diagram showing the number of the probes which are over-lapped with each genotype.  scatter plots created from the gene list  identified in  and , respectively. each probes was plotetted according to their gene symbol and sox <dig>  specific are shown in red and sox <dig>  are in blue. greens in  show probes expresssed more than  <dig> fold. the value in both axis is mean of log intensity from three replicates.  the result of go term analysis of biological process by using sox <dig>   <dig> probes in . top four from the lowest p-value go terms are shown. in1-d: sox <dig>  es cells; in1 + d: sox <dig>  xen-like cells; in6-d; sox <dig>  es cells; in6 + d; sox <dig>  xen-like cells



next, we re-plotted these differentially expressed genes to identify genes which are significantly up- or down-regulated in sox <dig>  xen-like cells . we confirmed that  <dig> probes out of  <dig> identified in fig. 6c are under-expressed in sox <dig>  xen-like cells , and that the  <dig> probes out of  <dig> probes identified in fig. 6d are more than  <dig> fold higher in sox <dig>  xen-like cells than in sox <dig>  xen-like cells . among the sox <dig>  specific  <dig> probes, we could identify  <dig> genes which are not upregulated in sox <dig>  xen-like cells  xen-like cells of  <dig> , expresssion profile of these are shown in additional file 3: figure s2). these data suggest that sox <dig> function is not required for the induction of most of the extra-embryonic endoderm-specific genes although it may involve in the down-regulation of the es-associated genes. what is the nature of the  <dig> genes that fail to be up-regulated in sox <dig>  xen-like cells? when we performed go term analysis for these  <dig> genes, we found that the significantly-enriched go terms  were blood vessel development, and vasculature development, confirming that the expression of the extraembryonic endoderm genes was not affected in the absence of sox <dig> 

discussion
primitive endoderm is the second cell lineage segregated in mouse development and is essential for proper embryonic development. a recent report proposed a three step mechanism to direct differentiation of primitive endoderm  <cit> . the first step is the initiation of gata <dig> expression in the blastomeres of morula in a fgf4-dependent manner at e <dig> -e <dig> . the second step is the competition between nanog and gata <dig> to establish their reciprocal expression in epiblast and primitive endoderm, respectively, in the early blastocyst at e <dig> -e <dig> . the third step is the maturation of primitive endoderm by induction of gata <dig> and sox <dig> in a fgf4-dependent manner in the late blastocyst at e <dig> -e <dig> . it was also reported that sox <dig> is up-regulated in primitive endoderm of the late blastocyst following the up-regulation of sox <dig> and gata <dig>  <cit> , suggesting its role in finalizing the maturation step. here we demonstrated that the function of sox <dig> is dispensable for both differentiation and maturation of primitive endoderm in an es cell model system.

in human es cells, it was shown that sox <dig> overexpression induces primitive endoderm differentiation  <cit> . however, here we showed that the inducible overexpression of sox <dig> is not sufficient to trigger rapid differentiation toward primitive endoderm, although the inducible expression of gata <dig> with the same system is sufficient  <cit> . these data are consistent with the scenario where gata <dig> acts as a trigger of differentiation toward primitive endoderm whereas sox <dig> acts later on. in the case of sox <dig>  several reports indicated that its forced expression in mouse es cells causes their differentiation to primitive endoderm as well as xen-like cells . however, in these instances, the effect of sox <dig> is limited to the induction of endoderm marker genes without a morphological differentiation event or gradual induction of differentiation to xen-like cells after 12 days  <cit> , and none of them demonstrated comparable activity of sox <dig> to induce rapid differentiation to xen-like cells within 4 days as in the cases for gata <dig> and gata <dig>  although we have not tested the ability of sox <dig> to induce gradual differentiation, the previous data for sox <dig> and the data presented in this manuscript for sox <dig>  suggest that the function of soxf family member as a trigger of differentiation is distinct from that of gata factors.

recently, sox <dig> ko mice were generated to test its role in congenital diphragmatic hernia  development  <cit> . it was shown that, sox <dig> null embryos died between e <dig>  and e <dig> , and that null embryos were indistinguishable from wt embryos at e <dig>  stage. this result clearly shows that in vivo sox <dig> depletion does not affect the formation of extramebryonic endoderm tissues which supply developemental signals as well as nutrients to the embryo. it is consistent with our observations in vitro using sox7-null es cells, in which sox <dig> is dispensable for differentiation of extraembryonic endoderm by eb formation and by artificial activation of gata <dig>  in the analyses of gene expression induced by gata <dig>  we found that the extraembryonic endoderm-associated genes were properly up-regulated in the absence of sox <dig>  indicating that sox <dig> is not required for establishment of the extraembryonic endoderm-associated gene expression profile. only  <dig> genes were activated in wild-type but not in sox7-null xen-like cells, but the go term analysis revealed that these genes are enriched for vasculature development. this is an interesting coincidence, given the finding that sox <dig> is expressed in vascular endothelial cells in later development and sox7-null embryos showed failure of yolk sac remodeling with signs of vascular failure  <cit> . this suggests an indispensable role of sox <dig> in vascular development both in vivo and in vitro.

dispensability of the sox <dig> function in extraembryonic endoderm development might be due to the functional overlap with similar genes. sox <dig> belongs to the group f sox family that includes sox <dig> and sox <dig> as the other members. it was reported that these three group f sox family genes could have overlapping function. the loss of either sox <dig> or sox <dig> does not affect the extraembryonic endoderm development, as is the case for the loss of sox <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the analysis of knockout mice demonstrated the overlapping function of sox <dig> and sox <dig> in early cardiovascular development  <cit> , and hosking et al. presented that the effect of the loss of sox <dig> in vascular development is compensated by sox <dig> and sox <dig> in particular genetic backgrounds, in which these genes are up-regulated in sox18-null embryos although they are never expressed in wild-type embryos  <cit> . in primitive endoderm, sox <dig> showed an overlapping expression pattern with sox <dig>  and niimi et al. reported that both sox <dig> and sox <dig> activate the pe-specific enhancer of the lama <dig> gene, suggesting their overlapping function  <cit> . the comprehensive analysis of the group f sox family members will be required to reveal their precise function in extraembryonic endoderm development.

CONCLUSIONS
sox <dig> was considered to be an important molecule for primitive endoderm differentiation because of its restricted expression pattern. however, this es cell based study shows that sox <dig>  es cells can differentiate into primitive endoderm lineage by spontaneous eb differentiation and gata6-mediated xen-like cell conversion. these results show that sox <dig> is dispensable for this lineage conversion event.
