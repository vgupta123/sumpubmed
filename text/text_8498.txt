BACKGROUND
extremely halophilic archaea  have adapted to thrive in environments of high salinity, desiccation, and intense solar radiation. these microorganisms require at least  <dig>  -  <dig>  m nacl for viability and typically display optimal growth in nacl concentrations at or above  <dig>  m. haloarchaea commonly inhabit hypersaline environments, e.g. salt lakes, salterns, and heavily salted hides, meats, fish, and sauces  <cit> . additionally, haloarchaea have been shown to survive space conditions  <cit>  and viable cells have been reported from ancient deep underground salt deposits  <cit> . unlike most other extremophilic and archaeal microorganisms, haloarchaea form a monophyletic and coherent taxonomic group, the family haloarchaeaceae  <cit> .

the halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> genome sequence gave researchers the first opportunity, at the genome level, to probe the mechanisms of adaptation to hypersaline brine  <cit> . characterization of the  <dig> mbp chromosome and two large megaplasmids showed that the overwhelming majority of predicted proteins were highly acidic, with a pi mode of  <dig> , and very few neutral or basic proteins  <cit> . in contrast, predicted proteins from most other non-haloarchaeal and bacterial organisms had equal fractions of acidic and basic components. the negatively charged residues in haloarchaeal proteins were predominantly found at the protein surface and predicted to function in enhancing their solubility and stability in high salt concentrations. a few individual haloarchaeal proteins have been crystallized, e.g. malate dehydrogenase, dihydrofolate reductase, and dna sliding clamp , and they all display markedly more acidic residues than non-haloarchaeal homologs. they also possess clusters of negative charges on the surface  <cit> . the high prevalence of negatively charged surface residues produces tightly bound hydration shells with salt ions bound at the protein surface  <cit> .

several previous studies have examined the gene content in haloarchaea, including one aimed at identifying information transfer genes and another concerning metabolic genes  <cit> . while a significant degree of conservation was found among the essential components of dna replication, repair, and recombination, transcription, and translation, the study of metabolic genes showed substantially more diversity. indeed, this diversity was illustrated by the recent identification of genes for a new pathway in central carbon metabolism, the methylaspartate cycle, in several haloarchaea  <cit> . an additional characteristic observed in most haloarchaeal genomes is the presence of large megaplasmids or minichromosomes which often harbor important or essential genes  <cit> . gene content in these large extrachromosomal elements was compared and resulted in the finding of expanded gene families for replication and transcription initiation, e.g. orc and tfb  <cit> , as well as the presence of a variety of genes needed for cell survival, e.g. an amino-acyl trna synthetase  <cit> , resistance to arsenic  <cit> , and production of buoyant gas vesicles  <cit> .

in the current study, we present a comprehensive analysis of haloarchaeal genomes aimed at identifying the core haloarchaeal proteins and uniquely haloarchaeal groups. halophilic archaea representing thirteen different genera were included, all within the haloarchaeaceae family. these microorganisms represent both geographic and phylogenetic diversity, including isolates from all  <dig> continents  and almost half of the genera in this tight clade of the euryarchaea  <cit> . the genome-wide analysis produced nearly  <dig> protein clusters that are completely conserved among sequenced haloarchaea and a subset of  <dig> protein families that are unique to this family of extremophilic microbes.

RESULTS
haloarchaeal orthologous groups 
using the best reciprocal hit method,  <dig>  predicted proteins from nine complete haloarchaeal genomes  were initially compared to form  <dig>  haloarchaeal orthologous groups    <cit> . our results showed that the overwhelming majority of predicted haloarchaeal proteins were members of hogs, ranging from a high of  <dig> % for halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> to a low of  <dig> % for h. utahensis. these results underscored the close relationship of these haloarchaeal species.

*cogs and kogs both include s. cerevisiae

core hogs 
we examined the abundance of the haloarchaeal proteins present in these  <dig>  hogs and found a bimodal distribution . the largest number of protein clusters were found in either  <dig> or  <dig> haloarchaea  or all  <dig> members , and the protein clusters with an intermediate  number of haloarchaea were less abundant . the  <dig> clusters conserved in all nine organisms were designated as core haloarchaeal orthologous groups   and represented proteins that are known or expected to be important or essential in all of the haloarchaea . taking into account that several hogs correspond to more than a single cog and kog, comparison of the chogs to the cog and kog databases in ncbi showed that of the  <dig> chogs,  <dig> corresponded to both cogs and kogs and  <dig> corresponded to cogs only, with  <dig> novel clusters unique to haloarchaea.

uniquely haloarchaeal orthologous groups 
of the  <dig> chogs present in all nine haloarchaea,  <dig>  appeared to be unique to haloarchaea based on their absence in both the cog and kog databases. these unique core hogs  were candidates for being 'signature' proteins for this clade, based on their ubiquity among haloarchaea and absence in non-haloarchaeal clades . however, since the members of these protein clusters were quite diverse, with the percent identity varying widely , we re-appraised the statistical significance of group members by carrying out pairwise alignments of the proteins within each cluster, including randomized global alignments for statistical analysis using the needleman and wunsch algorithm  <cit> . using this approach, we were able to establish a  <dig> % confidence level for pairs of sequences among proteins within each cluster.

with the rapid sequencing of new haloarchaeal genomes, we further scrutinized the  <dig> uchogs using a sequential multi-step approach:  protein sequences were blasted against four recently available complete haloarchaeal genome sequences  to find conserved haloarchaeal homologs,  protein sequences were blasted against the ncbi non-redundant database to find non-haloarchaeal hits, and  any non-haloarchaeal hits identified were aligned with each member of the chog cluster. of the  <dig> clusters with no associated cogs or kogs, all members of  <dig> uchog clusters were found to be truly unique core haloarchaeal orthologous groups and named tuchogs . of the remaining  <dig> clusters,  <dig> were absent in one or more of the four newly sequenced genomes, and  <dig> had one or more members with at least one hit to a non-haloarchaeal peptide. proteins from six clusters had hits to over a dozen different non-haloarchaeal proteins and proteins from the remaining  <dig> clusters had fewer hits, ranging from  <dig> -  <dig> per cluster. the significance of hits was evaluated by base composition-preserved randomized alignments. this analysis showed that the  <dig> chog clusters with hits to non-haloarchaeal proteins were not entirely unique to the haloarchaea with a  <dig> % or higher level of confidence, and were named nearly unique core haloarchaeal orthologous groups, or nuchogs .

genomic locations and functions of uchogs
consistent with a critical role in the biology of haloarchaea, uchogs were found to be encoded overwhelmingly on the main chromosomes of haloarchaeal organisms. indeed, in five, halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  h. marismortui, n. pharaonis, h. utahensis, and h. walsbyi, all of the tuchog polypeptides were chromosomally encoded and dispersed relatively evenly over the entire chromosome . only seven tuchog protein genes did not map to large chromosomal replicons, with two on the small chromosome in h. lacusprofundi, one each on the phb <dig> and phb <dig> megaplasmids in h. borinquense, two on the phv <dig> megaplasmid in h. volcanii, and one on the phm <dig> megaplasmid in h. mukohataei . similarly, all of the nuchog proteins mapped to the large chromosomes of n. pharaonis, h. walsbyi, h. borinquense, h. mukohataei, h. utahensis, and h. lacusprofundi. a single nuchog protein is coded on both the smaller chromosome ii and png <dig> in h. marismortui, two nuchogs are coded on phv <dig> in h. volcanii, and one nuchogs is found on the common inverted repeats of pnrc <dig> and  <dig> of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> .

the function of only a single uniquely conserved haloarchaeal orthologous protein gene, vng <dig> , has so far been investigated in any detail  <cit> . in halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  the gene coding for this protein was annotated as ral  due to its transcriptional linkage to two genes, rfa <dig> and rfa <dig>  which encode eukaryotic replication protein a -like single-stranded dna binding protein subunits  <cit> . the genes around ral showed a significant degree of synteny among the haloarchaeal genomes , consistent with a conserved function in haloarchaea.

functional classification of hogs
biological functional categories were assigned to hogs by membership of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> hog proteins in cogs, where possible . however, the majority  of accessory hogs , protein clusters with peptide sequences from eight or fewer haloarchaea, were not members of any cogs or kogs, or were members of poorly characterized cogs and could not be assigned to a functional class. of the ahogs that could be assigned functions based on cog-association, 3% were classified as being involved in information transfer and storage, or in cellular processing and signaling, and 8% were classified as being involved in metabolism.

†- several hogs were associated with one or more cog and all functional categories were tabulated.

in contrast, the great majority  of chogs was associated with one or more cogs and kogs, and a large fraction, 69%, was assigned to a functional class based on this criterion.

 among chogs, we classified 25% of the protein clusters as being involved in information transfer and storage  <cit> . half of the proteins in these chogs were involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis, including  <dig> 50s ribosomal subunit clusters ,  <dig> 30s ribosomal subunit clusters , and  <dig> amino-acyl trna synthetase clusters . in addition, we identified  <dig> chogs as containing rna polymerase ii-like enzymes , two containing origin recognition complex homologs , three containing histone acetyltransferases , two containing transcription initiation factor iib homologs , and one containing transcription initiation factor iid homologs .

 an additional 10% of chog protein clusters was classified as being involved in cellular processing and signaling. half of the proteins in these chogs were involved in posttranslational modification, protein turnover, or assembly, including two proteasome subunit clusters , four heat shock protein clusters , and two thermosome subunit clusters . three categories of cogs, nuclear structure, cytoskeleton, and extracellular structure, were not represented in any of the hogs.

 the largest number of chogs  was classified as being involved in metabolism. unlike chogs involved in information transfer and storage and cellular processes and signaling, there was no single category of metabolism that was overwhelmingly abundant. four categories, energy production and conversion, amino acid transport and metabolism, nucleotide transport and metabolism, and coenzyme transport and metabolism, each contained over  <dig> chogs and accounted for 5% or more of the core clusters. included in these chogs were nine atp synthase subunit clusters , and ten nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit clusters .

the number of chogs associated with a cellular process did not necessarily correlate with the degree of conservation of that process. in particular, while there was a smaller number of chogs associated with information transfer and storage than metabolism, the proteins involved in information transfer and storage were more conserved in haloarchaea than those of metabolism or cellular processing and signaling. a large majority  of hogs associated with information transfer and storage was conserved in all nine genomes, whereas only 46% and 38% of the metabolism and cellular processing and signaling hogs, respectively, were conserved in all of the genomes.

newly sequenced haloarchaeal genomes
we also used blast analysis to determine if the chog proteins were conserved in four recently completed genomes . homologs of the overwhelming majority of the chogs  were identified in the recently completed genomes of haloterrigena turkmenica, halopiger xanaduensis, natrialba magadii, and halalkalicoccus jeotgali, with only six, two, five, and six clusters absent in these species, respectively . among the unique genes, five out of  <dig> tuchogs and one of the  <dig> uchogs in the nine original genomes analyzed were absent in one or more of the four newer haloarchaeal genomes .

discussion
our current study has established core and unique haloarchaeal proteins and assigned likely functions to these conserved haloarchaeal proteins among sequenced haloarchaea. the core haloarchaeal orthologous groups  contained nearly  <dig> protein clusters that accounted for  <dig> - 33% of each predicted haloarchaeal proteome. the majority  of the core proteins could be assigned specific or general functions based on association with ncbi kogs and/or cogs, while the remainder  were novel and could not be correlated to any previously known protein clusters. based on further analysis of four recently sequenced haloarchaeal genomes and statistical analysis of alignments with non-haloarchaeal homologs,  <dig> protein clusters  were identified as haloarchaeal signature proteins.

the precise functions of the signature proteins are not clear because of their unique nature and the dearth of experimental studies focused on these genes. only a single example among the truly unique haloarchaeal orthologous groups, ral , was examined in any previous experimental work and was suggested to function in double-stranded dna break repair and desiccation/radiation tolerance in the model haloarchaeon, halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  <cit> . transcriptome analysis of both uv irradiated halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig> and its highly ionizing radiation resistant mutants showed an up-regulation of the rfa3-rfa8-ral operon, consistent with their involvement in dna repair and protection  <cit> . due to the transcriptional linkage of the three genes, and the presence of oligonucleotide binding  folds in rfa <dig> and rfa <dig>  the ral gene was also hypothesized to function as part of the eukaryotic-type single-stranded dna binding rpa complex. however, analysis of the amino acid sequence of ral did not reveal an ob fold domain, and it is not clear whether it serves as the third subunit of the rpa complex, replacing the rpa <dig> subunit found in eukaryotic organisms. while additional experimental studies are still required to determine the precise function of ral, the possibility that it, as well as those of the other uniquely conserved haloarchaeal proteins, functions in adaptation of these organisms to their naturally extreme environments is an attractive hypothesis.

a somewhat larger  group of protein clusters, unique core haloarchaeal proteins , includes  <dig> members which are nearly unique to haloarchaea  and  <dig> which are truly unique to haloarchaea . our bioinformatic analysis of the uchogs suggested that they are quite typical of haloarchaeal proteins in pi, molecular weight, and gc-composition of their genes. the average pi of the uchogs is  <dig> , similar to other haloarchaeal proteins . similarly, the average g + c content of the uchogs are typical for each haloarchaeal chromosome  . their average molecular weight,  <dig>  kda, is somewhat smaller than predicted haloarchaeal proteins in general,  <dig> kda . their smaller size is consistent with their role as accessories to protein complexes, as suggested for the ral protein in single-stranded dna binding and dna repair and protection. for example, as a group, uchogs may improve the activity or function of complexes in the cytoplasm with essentially saturating concentrations of kcl  <cit> . the great majority of uchogs appear to be soluble proteins .

the genomic distribution of uchog protein genes was examined and they were found to map overwhelmingly on the chromosomes in all of the haloarchaeal microorganisms . in the case of halobacterium sp. nrc- <dig>  all of the tuchogs and all but one of the nuchogs were located on the chromosome . the haloarchaea do not contain more than one or at most two of these proteins on megaplasmids. these findings suggest that the uchog proteins serve integral functions in these microorganisms and are likely important and possibly critical for survival. in addition to their likely important function, the uchogs, and especially the signature proteins  and their genes, will also be useful as markers for the presence of members of the haloarchaeaceae family in the environment.

of the  <dig> uchogs,  <dig> were not completely unique to haloarchaea, with one or a few homologs present in non-haloarchaea . a large fraction  of the hits were to methanogenic archaea belonging to the methanosarcinaceae, methanosaetaceae, and methanocellaceae families, which are relatively close to haloarchaea based on phylogenetic analysis of 16s sequences and include some moderate halophiles  <cit> . there were also a number of hits to halophilic bacteria, e.g., salinibacter ruber, which may be the result of lateral gene transfer between species in a common environment  <cit> . of the clusters determined to not be uniquely haloarchaeal,  <dig> were associated with archaeal cogs  containing non-haloarchaeal homologs, consistent with their presence in more than a single family of archaea  <cit>  . this may reflect the distinct and common ancestry of the archaea.

prior to our study, an analysis of conserved proteins in the archaea was first completed on eight archaeal genomes which did not include any haloarchaeal genomes  <cit> . in this early study,  <dig> signature proteins present in at least two of the archaeal genomes were identified. in a subsequent study,  <dig> archaeal genomes were compared, including two haloarchaeal genomes  <cit> . the number of signature proteins shared by all  <dig> genomes decreased to only six and an additional  <dig> were identified in the majority of archaeal genomes. in an analysis of four haloarchaeal genomes,  <dig> haloarchaeal-specific proteins were reported  <cit> . of these, we classified  <dig> as signature proteins or tuchogs,  <dig> as nuchogs, while the remaining  <dig> were either missing in one or more of the  <dig> haloarchaeal genomes or were associated with a cog . in another report, ten haloarchaeal genomes were recently compared and  <dig> 'signature' clusters were reported  <cit> , of which we found that  <dig> were similar to tuchogs and  <dig> are like nuchogs .

several studies aimed at identifying signature proteins in other taxonomic groups have been conducted for organisms from other domains of life. among bacteria, an analysis of actinobacterial genomes found  <dig> signature proteins present in the majority of genomes and an additional  <dig> that are found in some, but not all of the genomes  <cit> . in another study  <cit> , five chlamydial genomes and one parachlamydial genome were compared, and  <dig> proteins were conserved in all six genomes, coded by hypothetical genes with no known functions. two subsequent studies of α-proteobacterial genomes reported signature proteins  <cit> . initially three genomes were compared and six signature proteins were identified in the majority of α-proteobacterial genomes and an additional  <dig> proteins were identified in some but not all subgroups  <cit> . with the increase to  <dig> α-proteobacterial genomes, further work showed that only four of the original six signature proteins were present in all of the genomes  <cit> . among eukaryotes,  <dig> conserved signature proteins were identified in sequenced genomes, including the deeply branching giardia lamblia species  <cit> .

the entire set of genes within a given species or group of organisms, in essence, the combination of the core and all dispensable genes, is sometimes referred to as the "pan-genome"  <cit> . with this approach, as more whole genomes become available, the size of the pan-genome increases due to an increase in the number of accessory genes, while the size of the core-genome asymptotically reaches a minimum. while there are numerous studies of species level pan-genomes, there are only a few published studies at the genus or family level. a study of  <dig> genomes from the streptococcus genus found that the core-genome contains  <dig> orthologous groups, which constituted  <dig> - 30% of any one genome  <cit> . analysis of  <dig> genomes from the vibrionaceae family found the core-genome of  <dig>  orthologous groups constituted  <dig> - 50% of these genomes  <cit> . analysis of six genomes from the enterobacteriaceae family identified  <dig>  core orthologous groups that accounted for  <dig> - 88% of these genomes  <cit> .

our result from this study of the haloarchaeaceae family showed that  <dig> - 33% of each genome constituted the core-genome and was similar to the results reported in earlier studies on other groups. moreover, the great majority of core orthologous groups identified in the first nine haloarchaea were conserved in the subsequent four sequenced species. our preliminary results with analysis of the pan-genome of haloarchaea show an expanding number of dispensable genes among members of this group . the sequencing of additional haloarchaeal genomes and metagenomes and further bioinformatic analysis are likely to yield additional insights into the genetic composition of this interesting group of extremophilic microorganisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the signature and core genes and proteins are valuable concepts for understanding phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of coherent groups of organisms. our analysis of  <dig> haloarchaea from different genera has established that the haloarchaeal proteome consists of  <dig>  orthologous groups ,  <dig> of which form the core proteome , and  <dig> of which constitute haloarchaeal signature proteins . the conservation of the chog and tuchog clusters suggests that they may be essential or vital for survival. an attractive hypothesis, similar to what has been suggested for ral, the only tuchog with a predicted function, is that these small, chromosomally encoded proteins may act as accessory proteins enhancing macromolecular function in extreme conditions.
