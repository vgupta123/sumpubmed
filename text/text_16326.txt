BACKGROUND
t cell development mainly takes place in the thymus and is characterized by defined developmental stages ultimately leading to the generation of mature αβ and γδ t cells. the earliest t cell progenitors entering the thymus via the bloodstream lack cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression and are therefore called double-negative . dn thymocytes can be further subdivided into four successive developmental stages according to the expression of cd <dig>  and cd <dig>   <cit> . the most immature progenitors  are assigned to the cd44+cd25- subset. upregulation of cd <dig> marks progression to the dn <dig> stage . irreversible commitment to the t cell lineage is not established until the dn <dig> stage, which can be identified as the cd44-cd25+ dn subset. in this cell population, rearrangement of the tcrβ- or tcrγδ genes is accomplished, leading to either development into the αβ- or the γδ lineage. for αβ t cells, a successfully generated tcrβ chain leads to formation of the pretcr via pairing with the pretα chain and cd <dig> signalling complexes. thymocytes failing to generate a pretcr undergo programmed cell death  <cit> . thymocytes otherwise destined to induce programmed cell death are rescued from apoptosis upon pretcr generation. this event is termed β-selection, leading to extensive cellular expansion and cessation of further tcrβ locus recombination . cells which have passed this developmental checkpoint downregulate cd <dig> to become dn <dig> cells and then proceed to the numerically dominant cd4and cd <dig> double-positive  stage. lymphocytes evading cell death are frequently the origin of malignant transformations  <cit> . although of high clinical relevance, the regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic processes at this specific stage of development is still incompletely understood.

in the past years, it has been established that for commitment to the t cell lineage notch signalling is essential  <cit> . in combination with the pretcr, notch induces proliferation and differentiation to dp thymocytes  <cit> . more recently, notch ligand engagement was additionally shown to be crucial for controlling progenitor cell metabolism by activating phosphatidyl-inositol-kinase- <dig> , akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin  complex  <cit> . notch- and pretcr-dependent upregulation of mtor induces expression of the nutrient receptors cd <dig>  and cd <dig> . this is, together with the pdk-1- and mtor-dependent activation of agc-serine kinases like s <dig> kinase  <dig> and ribosomal s <dig> kinase, a key event for cell mass increase and induction of a proliferation-competent status, eventually leading to six to ten consecutive rounds of cell division after passage of the β-selection checkpoint.

sh <dig> lymphocyte protein  is a putative adapter protein containing a sh3- and sam-domain. it constitutes the first described member of a family of highly homologous proteins conserved in mammals whose molecular function is still elusive. the protein sly <dig> consists of  <dig> amino acids and is exclusively expressed in lymphocytes  <cit> . it has been originally found in an adhesion assay screen using a t cell lymphoma cdna library. sly <dig> has been independently identified by another group during a screen for new serine kinase substrates  <cit> . there it was shown that sly <dig> is specifically phosphorylated upon t cell receptor -triggering or stimulation with phorbol esters at serin <dig>  this phosphorylation could be prevented by protein kinase c - or pi3kinase-inhibitors, however, the directly phosphorylating kinase has not been identified to date. further hints for a possible involvement of sly <dig> in the tcr-transduction pathway were delivered by the immune-compromised phenotype of mice expressing a truncated sly <dig> protein. this truncation resulted in aberrant subcellular localisation of the remaining protein sly1Δ which is lacking part of the bipartite nuclar localisation sequence and the known phosphorylation site  <cit> . furthermore, it was shown that sly <dig> plays a substantial role in the development and activation of immune cells, although the underlying mechanism of this phenotype could not be clarified  <cit> .

two additional highly homologous proteins have been described: sly <dig>  also termed samsn1/nash1/hacs <dig>  is more broadly expressed in haematopoietic tissues, endothelial cells and myeloid leukemias and myelomas  <cit> . sly <dig> has been implicated in inducing a plasma-cell-like phenotype when overexpressed in b cells and has been linked to the inhibitory receptor pirb  <cit> . the sly <dig> locus lies in a region which is frequently disrupted in translocation events leading to haematopoietic malignancies  <cit> . most recent data suggest the involvement of sly <dig> as tumour suppressor in human lung cancer  <cit> . sly <dig>  is expressed in almost all tissues and has been repeatedly described as a tumour suppressor based on its frequent downregulation in breast cancer and colon carcinoma  <cit> .

in this study, mice harbouring a complete deletion of sly <dig> protein were generated and thymocyte development was subsequently analysed. thereby, an important role for the orphan adapter protein sly <dig> at the thymocyte dn to dp progression was identified, leading to a reduction in thymic cellularity by about 50%. sly1-deficient thymocytes were compromised in inducing nutrient receptor expression and ribosomal protein s <dig> phosphorylation, indicating a defect in mtor complex activation and suggesting a role for sly <dig> in integrating signals derived from the pretcr and from the notch receptor. this defect resulted in abnormally increased deletion of precursor cells by induction of programmed cell death, yielding a strong reduction in dp thymocyte numbers. interestingly, sly1Δ mice expressing a protein harbouring a deletion of  <dig> amino acids in the n-terminal region of sly <dig> exhibited an identical phenotype. thus, a non redundant role for this region comprising the phosphorylation site and part of the nuclear localisation sequence  could be assigned.

RESULTS
to elucidate the role of sly <dig>  mice expressing a truncated sly <dig> protein  have been generated previously  <cit> . sly1Δ/Δ mice display a severe defect in lymphocyte numbers as determined by measuring cellularity of lymphoid organs and lymphocyte activation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. as the expression of a truncated protein can display unpredictable results, the phenotype of sly1Δ/Δ mice may actually not reflect the precise molecular role of sly <dig> in lymphocyte development and activation. therefore, sly1-/--mice were generated by injection of e <dig> embryonic stem cells carrying a targeted homologous inactivation of sly <dig>  figure 1a shows the arrangement of the first exons of the genomic sly <dig> locus and of the targeting vector. after homologous recombination of the target vector with the sly <dig> locus, a neomycin cassette is integrated in reverse orientation in exon  <dig>  arrows indicate the position of screening oligonucleotides which lead to a  <dig>  kb versus  <dig>  kb pcr product for the wildtype  and knockout  allele, respectively . germ line transmission of the ko allele was confirmed by southern blotting . complete inactivation of the sly <dig> gene was verified by western blot  using two different antibodies recognizing different epitopes of sly <dig> protein.

reduced cellularity of lymphoid organs
sly1-/- mice were born at normal mendelian ratios, appeared healthy and were fertile. sly1Δ/Δ mice have been reported to display diminished lymphoid organ cellularity  <cit> . to this regard, the impact of a complete sly1-deficiency was assessed. analysis of lymphoid organ cell count revealed a significant reduction of lymphoid organ cell numbers of sly1-/- mice compared to sly1+/+ littermates . cell numbers of thymi were reduced by 46%, splenocyte cellularity by 42% and lymph node cellularity by 51%. the mean number of macroscopically visible peyer's patches also was clearly reduced to  <dig>  + <dig>  compared to  <dig>  + <dig>  in wt littermates . nevertheless, major sly1-/- splenic lymphocyte subpopulation ratios as determined by facs were grossly normal except a reduction in percentages of marginal zone b cells . overall, all sly1-/- lymphocyte subpopulations were decreased in cell number due to the smaller organ size , even though major b and t cell subpopulation ratios were normal. in summary, these data are strikingly reminiscent of the previously described phenotype of sly1Δ/Δ mice, which also displayed a reduction in cellularity of lymphoid organs, namely spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and peyer's patches  <cit> .

delayed t cell development
as both partial and complete deletion of sly <dig> protein had an obviously deleterious effect on thymocyte cell number leading to a reduction of about 50% of wt levels, sly1-dependent thymocyte development was examined more closely. sly <dig> is expressed in all major thymocyte subsets, as determined by rt-pcr . to gain a better understanding of the impact of the n-terminal truncation in the sly <dig> protein versus complete deletion, sly1Δ/Δ thymocytes were included in the following experiments. cd4- and cd8-staining of total thymocytes revealed no apparent differences in percentages of dp and single-positive  cells in the thymus . comparable expression of tcrβ, cd <dig> and cd <dig> on dp thymocytes indicated normal tcr signalling and positive selection events in sly1-targeted thymocytes . in line with the reduced thymocyte cellularity, sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ mice had markedly reduced total numbers of cd4+ and cd8+ dp and sp thymocytes, only a minor decrease in dn thymocyte counts was observed . these results suggested a partially delayed development of dn to dp thymocytes in the absence of a functional sly <dig> protein. in accordance with this hypothesis, a doubling in the percentage of dn cells in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymi was observed . this prompted us to further analyse the dn subset frequencies based on the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> . we observed a slight decrease in dn <dig>  a slight increase in dn <dig> and dn <dig> ratios in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymi, and a slight decrease in dn <dig>  therefore, sly <dig> appears to be required for developmental progression in all four thymic dn subsets and the block in development could not be assigned to a specific dn stage, providing a first hint that sly <dig> expression is especially critical in thymic dn progenitor cells.

defect in proliferation and differentiation in vitro
the partial block in developmental progression of dn thymocytes lacking functional sly <dig> protein indicated that proliferation of dn thymocytes in sly1-defective mice might be impaired. to test this hypothesis, we analysed sly1-dependent thymocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitro. to this end, the bone marrow stromal cell line op <dig> was used allowing in vitro differentiation of dn to dp thymocytes induced by presentation of the notch ligand delta-like  <dig>  on the surface of op <dig> cells  <cit> . congruent with published data, sorted dn thymocytes proliferated and upregulated cd4- and cd8-expression dependent on the presence of notch ligand dl- <dig> after three and six days of cultivation on op <dig> cells . as expected from previously observed ex vivo data, we found a markedly reduced expansion rate of sorted sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn thymocytes upon cultivation on op <dig> cells compared to wt littermates . additionally, the differentiation of sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn thymocytes was diminished relative to littermate controls . if sorted dn <dig> cells were used, differentiation was equally affected, also adding il- <dig> to the medium gave similar results .

partially impaired activation of mtor-complex in sly1-defective dn thymocytes
one of the cellular outcomes of dn thymocytes successfully passing the β-selection check point is the upregulation of metabolic activity. this is a prerequisite to cope with the increasing energy demands at this developmental stage needed to allow for the upcoming extensive proliferation and differentiation of dn to dp thymocytes. of particular importance in this context is the activation of the rapamycin-sensitive mtor-complex eventually resulting in an increase in cell mass and subsequent induction of cell division. a first hint for a blunted mtor-dependent activation in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymocytes came from the observation of a reduced frequency of thymocytes with increased cell size ex vivo and after op <dig> dl- <dig> culture  <cit> . several key targets of mtor in activated dn thymocytes have been identified so far, their activation or induced expression being strictly dependent on the combined engagement of a successfully rearranged pretcr and notch receptor  <cit> . well reported events at this developmental stage are the activation of s <dig> kinase and upregulation of the nutrient receptors cd <dig> and cd <dig>  all of which have been shown to be rapamycin-sensitive  <cit> . first, mtor activation in sly1+/+ thymocyte t cell precursor populations ex vivo and after cultivation for  <dig> h on op <dig> dl- <dig> cells was analysed. this was accomplished by determination of cell size, phosphorylation of ribosomal protein s <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression as surrogate markers for mtor activity . in line with published data, activation of mtor in dn thymocytes is absolutely dependent on pretcr-expression ex vivo and in vitro. furthermore, mtor activation strictly requires notch signalling  and can be inhibited by addition of rapamycin in vitro. next, this single-cell based analysis was extended to sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymocytes ex vivo and after  <dig> h culture on op <dig> dl- <dig> cells . in summary, the activation status of mtor in pretcr-positive dn thymocytes of sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ mice was clearly reduced compared to wt littermates under both conditions tested. the activation of mtor in the absence of notch signalling or in pretcr-negative thymocytes was equally low . these results suggest a defect in inducing mtor-mediated activation signals in a subset of t cell precursor cells in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ mice in response to developmental needs. moreover, we propose a defect in transmitting signals from either the pretcr or the notch receptor to the mtor protein complex.

increased apoptosis induction in sly1-defective dn <dig> thymocytes
a decrease in the expansion rate of proliferating cells can be either mediated by alterations in cell cycle progression or elevated apoptosis induction, or even both. to identify the underlying mechanism for the observed proliferation defect, sorted dn thymocytes were plated on op <dig> dl- <dig> cells and cell cycle distribution as well as apoptosis induction was assessed. we found an equal cell cycle distribution based on dna-staining of permeabilized cells with dapi . yet an increase in early  and late  apoptosis induction in sly1-targeted thymocytes was detected . therefore we hypothesized that the impaired proliferation can be attributed to an increased apoptosis rate in the absence of functional sly <dig> protein. pretcr-expression and notch signalling have both been reported to play pivotal roles in protecting dn thymocytes from apoptosis at the β-selection checkpoint  <cit> . interestingly, sly <dig> protein has been reported to be specifically phosphorylated after tcr crosslinking in peripheral t cells  <cit> . it was hence reasonable to speculate a role for sly <dig> downstream of the pretcr or notch in this context. to dissect the pathways sly <dig> is involved in, we cultivated sorted dn <dig> cells on op <dig> dl- <dig> and op <dig> control cells to discriminate the role of notch signalling, and used caspase- <dig> active fragment as an intracellular marker for apoptosis induction . intracellular staining for tcrβ-expression served to identify cells which had successfully rearranged their tcr-β-chain and which should therefore receive pretcr-derived proliferative and survival signals. intracellular tcrβ-expression was similar between wt cells and sly1-targeted cells . as anticipated, caspase- <dig> activation was lowest in wt pretcr-positive dn <dig> thymocytes cultivated on op <dig> dl- <dig> cells, thus receiving a pretcr-derived and a notch-derived pro-survival signal, accounting for approximately 2% of caspase- <dig> active fragment positive thymocytes . in this setting, which physiologically corresponds to thymocytes successfully passing β-selection, apoptosis induction was increased 4-fold in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn <dig> thymocytes compared to wt littermate controls. in contrast, thymocytes failing to rearrange the tcrβ-chain stay tcrβ-negative and hence are increasingly prone to programmed cell death initiation. this was indeed the case: apoptosis induction in tcrβ-negative wt dn <dig> thymocytes was  <dig> times higher than in their tcrβ-positive counterparts . again, the percentage of caspase- <dig> positive progenitor cells was markedly increased  in sly1-/- or slyΔ/Δ cultures. interestingly, sly1-/- and slyΔ/Δ thymocytes also displayed increased susceptibility towards programmed cell death initiation in the absence of notch signalling . yet wt tcrβ-negative dn <dig> thymocytes cultivated on op <dig> control cells were highly susceptible to apoptosis, accounting for around 30% caspase-3-positive cells. though the rate of apoptotic sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn <dig> thymocytes was elevated roughly by 15% relative to wt controls . we also observed a more than twofold increase in caspase- <dig> activation in the pretcr-positive population of dn <dig> thymocytes when plated on op <dig> control cells in the absence of sly <dig>  thus, an overall increase in programmed cell death was observed in both sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn <dig> thymocytes. in general, tcrβ-expression was the major pro-survival determinant, notch signals even were detrimental if thymocytes failed to successfully rearrange their tcrβ-genes . nevertheless, caspase- <dig> activation was elevated in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ dn <dig> thymocytes independent of the availability of signals from the pretcr or the notch receptor or even both. in summary, these results suggest a general anti-apoptotic role of sly <dig> in dn <dig> thymocytes. remarkably, programmed cell death in dn <dig> cells was equally undetectable independent of sly1-expression . this data supports a specific role for sly <dig> in protecting dn <dig> thymocytes during the β-selection checkpoint. to further elucidate a possible role for sly <dig> in amplifying notch-derived signals, a titration of γ-secretase-inhibitor  which is reported to inhibit specifically notch receptor activation on sorted dn <dig> sly+/+, sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymocytes was performed . after six days of cultivation on op <dig> cells, differentiation and proliferation was assessed. appearance of dp cells gradually decreased with increasing gsi concentrations likewise did the expansion rate. at  <dig> μm gsi, inhibition was almost complete, as assessed by comparing the proliferation and differentiation rate with the op <dig> gfp cultivated controls. sly1Δ/Δ and sly1-/- thymocytes were found to be more sensitive than sly1+/+ thymocytes to intermediate concentrations of gsi, supporting a function for sly <dig> in signal propagation from the notch receptor. however, this increased sensitivity was only very weakly pronounced and could also be attributed to a defect in integration of pretcr and notch signals, as both signals are required for proliferation.

regulation of phosphorylation of sly <dig> in thymocytes
it has been reported that sly <dig> is phosphorylated at serine <dig> specifically upon tcr-stimulation in human peripheral t-lymphocytes and not upon chemokine- or cytokine-driven stimulation  <cit> . this data implicated a function of sly <dig> downstream of the tcr. in murine splenocytes, tcr-stimulation-induced phosphorylation can also be observed, albeit there is considerable basal phosphorylation in contrast to the situation in human lymphocytes . likewise, sly <dig> phosphorylation in murine thymocytes is sensitive to inhibition by the pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> . we also observed inhibition of sly1-phosphorylation by treatment with rapamycin, which has not been previously reported in peripheral lymphocytes and might reflect a differential regulation in thymocytes . interestingly, we detected a high degree of basal phosphorylation of sly <dig> in early developing dn <dig> and dn <dig> thymocytes isolated ex vivo, suggesting a requirement of the phosphorylated variant of sly <dig> in t cell development . in dn <dig> thymocytes, the ratio of pretcr-expressing thymocytes is low and also gated pretcr-negative dn thymocytes exhibited increased apoptosis induction , arguing against a role downstream of the pretcr. therefore, we reasoned that sly <dig> might be independently phosphorylated of pretcr-mediated signalling in early thymocytes. to test this hypothesis, rag1-/- dn thymocytes unable to rearrange the tcr-genes and therefore lacking pretcr-signalling were incubated over night on op <dig> cells, sorted and then sly1-phosphorylation was detected via western blotting . indeed, we observed pretcr-independent phosphorylation of sly <dig> in dn thymocytes as anticipated and in line with previous data. in addition, we detected an increase in sly <dig> phosphorylation in rag1-/- thymocytes stimulated with notch ligand. unexpectedly, this notch-induced increase in phosphorylation was only observed in pretcr-deficient thymocytes. in pretcr-sufficient rag1+/+ dn thymocytes, sly <dig> phosphorylation was diminished upon notch signalling . this data suggests a role for sly <dig> in integrating signals derived from the pretcr and from the notch receptor leading to prevention of premature apoptosis initiation in developing thymocytes.

discussion
t cell development is a tightly regulated process involving numerous successive steps of differentiation. of particular importance for the maturation of αβ t cells is the successful rearrangement of the vdj genes coding for the tcrβ chain which then pairs with the pretα chain to initiate pretcr signalling  <cit> . in the present work, induction of programmed cell death in dn <dig> thymocytes could be precisely recapitulated as being principally dependent on intracellular pretcr expression, thereby supporting pretcr-signalling as the major decisive constraint in death versus survival decision. furthermore, the orphan adapter protein sly <dig> was identified as a novel anti-apoptotic protein required for developmental progression of t cell precursors to the dp stage. this anti-apoptotic function resulted in protection of thymocytes from premature programmed cell death initiation at the dn <dig> thymocyte stage. as a consequence, thymocyte dp number and therefore total thymus cellularity was severely reduced in sly1-targeted mice.

haematopoietic progenitors entering the thymus via the bloodstream depend on a sustained notch receptor-ligand engagement to develop towards the t cell lineage  <cit> . the op <dig> differentiation system can be used to recapitulate the signals required for haematopoietic precursor cells to undergo t cell development until the dp thymocyte stage in vitro. this differentiation system was used to further elucidate the underlying defect responsible for the reduced cellularity of sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymi. as anticipated from the ex vivo situation, a reduction in proliferation and differentiation upon op <dig> culture relative to littermate controls was found. thus, a migration defect of progenitor cells with a subsequent reduction in thymic repopulation capacity as the major cause for the resulting defect in thymic cellularity could be excluded. furthermore, it could be clearly shown that the reduction in thymocyte proliferation is cell intrinsic and that the principal defect is not influenced by differences in thymic environment derived from stromal cells.

yet notch signalling is not only mandatory for commitment to the t cell lineage. recently, it was also shown to be crucial for inducing a replication-competent status in thymocytes once pretcr signalling is initiated  <cit> . a prerequisite for cellular expansion is an increased metabolic activity including elevated expression of nutrient receptors and protein synthesis. the activity of mtor has a key role in controlling this process. in peripheral t cells, growth factors have been reported to modulate akt and mtor activity and thereby to increase survival of t cells  <cit> . growth factor withdrawal resulted in metabolic collapse and loss of nutrient receptor expression. in sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ thymocytes, induced expression of the nutrient receptors cd <dig> and cd <dig> as well as s <dig> kinase activation were impaired relative to wt littermates. this diminished mtor activity correlated with a reduced cell size increase. therefore a defect in metabolic activity in sly1-defective thymocytes can be inferred, leading to increased cell death rate and concomitant reduction of thymic cellularity.

full mtor activation in dn thymocytes is dependent on both notch- and pretcr-derived signals  <cit> . there is limited insight into the signal integration process of both pathways in thymocytes. current literature data suggests that signal integration occurs at the level of pi3kinase activation. notch signalling is thought to decrease expression of pten, the negative regulator of pi3kinase activation  <cit> . pretcr-formation is thought to activate akt, probably also via pi3kinase activation  <cit> . it is not precisely clear how the presence of a pretcr without ligand engagement leads to the activation of akt, and whether there are also more direct interactions of the notch pathway with the pi3kinase pathway which are not regulated by transcription. the present work may add insight into how the different signals are processed by connecting them with the orphan adapter protein sly <dig>  the reduced frequency of sly1-/- and sly1Δ/Δ progenitor cells with increased metabolic activity suggests a role for sly <dig> in transmitting signals from either the pretcr or the notch receptor to mtor, or even for integrating signals from both receptors. as opposed to reports from peripheral t lymphocytes showing that sly <dig> phosphorylation is strictly dependent on tcr-stimulation, we have shown in this study that sly1-phosphorylation in thymocytes is independent of the pretcr. interestingly, we have found that the phosphorylation of sly <dig> at serine <dig> is differentially regulated upon notch-stimulation dependent on the absence or presence of pretcr-signalling. this differing phosphorylation could be interpreted as a signal integration process of the two converging pathways downstream of the notch receptor and downstream of the pretcr.

when cultured on op <dig> dl- <dig> and op <dig> gfp control cells, the anti-apoptotic function of sly <dig> was independent of pretcr- and notch-derived signals, indicating a general pro-survival role for sly <dig> protein independent of both receptors. however, op <dig> gfp cells have been reported to express mrna for the notch ligands jagged- <dig> and jagged- <dig>  although in low amounts  <cit> . therefore, it cannot be excluded that there might still be residual notch-signals available to thymocytes cultivated on op <dig> gfp control cells. in addition, op <dig> cells secrete or present other unknown factors required by haematopoietic precursor cells. these residual signals induced by unknown factors could therefore transmit anti-apoptotic signals which are not properly transmitted in sly1-defective thymocytes cultivated on op <dig> gfp cells compared to the situation in sly1+/+ thymocytes. in addition, freshly isolated thymocytes have already been receiving notch signals during their sojourn in the thymus in vivo, and therefore the increased apoptosis induction of sly1-defective thymocytes on op <dig> gfp cells compared to sly1+/+ thymocytes could already have been initiated in the thymus in vivo before isolation of the cells. yet unexpected is the observation that notch signalling can even drive thymocytes into apoptosis if they fail to generate a pretcr as observed upon op <dig> culture of dn <dig> thymocytes in the present work. in contrast to this notice, notch signalling in dn <dig> thymocytes is thought to play a general anti-apoptotic role by activating the akt kinase pathway  <cit> . this study therefore adds additional complexity to the effector functions of notch signalling in dn <dig> thymocytes, implying a pro-apoptotic outcome of notch receptor activation in a certain cellular context.

as previously described, sly1Δ/Δ mice expressing a sly <dig> protein harbouring a partial deletion in the n-terminal region show impaired immune responses  <cit> . the region missing in slyΔ contains part of a bipartite nuclear localisation sequence and the known phosphorylation site closely associated to the potential localisation sequences. as a consequence, the subcellular localisation of sly1Δ is shifted from a nucleocytoplasmic to a strictly cytoplasmic localisation  <cit> . the putative protein-protein interacting sh3- and sam-domains remain intact in sly1Δ, possibly still enabling its interference with other signalling proteins. however, a dominant negative effect of sly1Δ can be excluded due to the comparable phenotype of sly1-/- mice. one conclusion that can be drawn from this data is that an essential function, at least for t cell development, of sly <dig> is mediated by the amino acids at position 20– <dig>  an apparent role for this deleted region could be either to regulate the correct subcellular localisation of the protein or to be directly required for interaction with sly <dig> binding partners by providing a sequence specific recognition signal.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, sly <dig> is described as a novel anti-apoptotic protein required for thymocyte development by preventing dn thymocytes from premature initiation of programmed cell death. sly1-negative thymocytes exhibited impaired activation of the mtor complex, supporting an essential role of mtor in thymocyte development. we therefore propose a role for sly <dig> in signal integration of the notch receptor and pretcr pathways culminating in the activation of the mtor protein complex in developing thymocytes. as the sly <dig> gene is located on the x-chromosome in man, its function could be either negatively affected in some cases of x-linked immunodeficiency or activating mutations could contribute to lymphoma development. in the future, the identification of the interacting kinase and the precise molecular mechanism by which sly <dig> contributes to mtor activation and prevention of programmed cell death will be of great interest.
