BACKGROUND
porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative asaccharolytic bacterium, has been recognized as a key causative microbe in the pathogenesis of destructive chronic periodontitis. in addition, p. gingivalis is able to gain access into the bloodstream and attach to the vascular wall  <cit> . a great number of epidemiological studies indicate that there is an association between p. gingivalis infection and cardiovascular disease  <cit>  and dna of p. gingivalis has been detected in coronary stenotic artery plaques of myocardial infarction patients  <cit> . furthermore, many in vitro and animal experiments support the connection between p. gingivalis infection and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. we have previously reported that p. gingivalis induces neutrophil ros-production, sensitizes platelet for epinephrine, down-regulates immune response of t-cells and converts ldl to an atherogenic form  <cit> . although, it is not easy to conduct systematic studies in human subjects, in vitro studies have shown that p. gingivalis can invade different types of human vascular cells, including umbilical vein endothelial cells   <cit> , coronary artery smooth muscle cells  <cit> , and aortic smooth muscle cells  <cit> .

virulence factors of p. gingivalis, such as lipopolysaccharides , fimbriae, toxic products of metabolism and proteases have been identified to activate defensive response processes of host cells, leading to release of inflammatory mediators and chronic inflammation  <cit> . during the last decades, inflammation has been attributed as the key factor beneath atherosclerosis which was formerly considered as a bland lipid storage disease  <cit> . the development of atherosclerosis is due to a complex interaction between multiple risk factors including hypertension, high plasma levels of inflammatory mediators, and hypercholesterolemia  <cit> . it is possible that p. gingivalis, directly or indirectly, induces and supports inflammatory processes in the vessel wall. in atherogenesis, different cell types, including macrophages, monocytes, platelets, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells , are involved  <cit> .

vascular smooth muscle cells  are one of the fundamental components of the vessel wall and are involved in atherogenesis, plaque progression and rupture  <cit> . during atherogenesis, the vsmcs undergo phenotypic modulation from a quiescent to a synthetic state that is activated by various mediators, such as platelet-derived growth factor, and migrate from the media into the intima. in the intima, vsmcs enhance synthesis of extracellular matrix  and proliferate under the stimulation by specific cytokines. the proliferation of vsmcs and the production of ecm contribute to the plaque growth and the development of fibrotic cap. furthermore, the production of ecm facilitates accumulation of modified low-density lipoproteins  through binding to proteoglycans. after binding to proteoglycan, ldl is oxidized, which further activates vsmcs to produce more sulfated proteoglycans and arrest more ldl  <cit> .

up to now, no study has been conducted to elucidate the possible signaling mechanisms involved in vsmcs challenge with live p. gingivalis. the aim of this study is to investigate effects of p. gingivalis infection on gene and protein expression and its relation to cellular function of human aortic smooth muscle cells in order to clarify the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease.

RESULTS
p. gingivalis invades aosmcs
using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we found that p. gingivalis at the moi of  <dig> invaded aosmcs and after  <dig> hours showed mainly at perinuclear localization . compared with control samples , aosmcs infected by p. gingivalis demonstrated a disruption of stress fibers and a relocalization of f-actin to the cell periphery . the 3d images  show that p. gingivalis is able to invade aosmcs.

p. gingivalis increase aosmcs proliferation
the proliferative effects of viable p. gingivalis on aosmcs were examined with the neutral red assay. we found that aosmcs, after challenging with p. gingivalis for 24 h significantly increased the subsequent proliferation in  <dig> % serum after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, compared with the unstimulated cells, with a maximal effect after 48 h .

p. gingivalis changes gene expression in aosmcs
a difference in the expression of specific genes in aosmcs induced by p. gingivalis, was identified by setting the threshold of log fold change  above |1| with adjust p- value  <  <dig> . through analyzing mrna originated from  <dig> independent experiments, a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed, in which  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated, compared to the uninfected control group. a whole list of differentially expressed genes is provided in supplemental material . the whole data were visualized by circos  <cit>  .

for the differentially expressed genes, we found that  <dig> up-regulated genes  were significantly related to the go term of positive regulation of cell proliferation ;  <dig> down-regulated genes  were related to the go term of negative regulation of cell proliferation . the functional interaction network for the genes involved in these two categories is shown in .

pathway analysis of genes regulated by p. gingivalis using spia
the  <dig> up-regulated genes related to the go term of positive regulation of cell proliferation and  <dig> down-regulated genes related to the go term of negative regulation of cell proliferation were inserted in the r platform and analyzed using spia package. significant pathways were picked out by combining the fold change of the genes and pathways topology information. for each pathway, a novel parameter, termed perturbation, was measured by the position of specific genes within the  <dig> kegg pathways. genes with a high hierarchical position would have more power to determine whether the genes are enriched in a certain pathway. for a total of  <dig> genes, spia analysis showed that these genes were enriched in  <dig> pathways , in which,  <dig> pathways were considered significant with a level of 5% after bonferroni correction . all  <dig> pathways are listed in supplemental material .

validation of microarray data in notch and tgf-beta pathway
in this study, we focused on tgf-beta and notch pathway that are known to be involved in the proliferation of aosmcs. several differentially expressed genes in these two pathways were picked out and validated by qpcr. the gene tgf- β <dig>  which belong to the tgf-beta pathway, showed up-regulation by p. gingivalis in both the microarray and the qrt-pcr assay , as well as in protein level . we further validated the gene of connective tissue growth factor , which has been indicated to cooperate with tgf-beta to induce fibrosis  <cit> . the qpcr analysis of the ctgf gene  confirms the p. gingivalis-mediated up-regulation of this gene and complements the results from the microarray. the third gene selected for validation of microarray data was smad family member  <dig>  , which has previously been shown to be a signaling components of the tgf-beta superfamily  <cit> . in notch pathway, we focused on two genes, notch <dig>  and hairy/enhancer-of-split related with yrpw motif protein  <dig>  . notch <dig>  which functions as a membrane-bound signaling molecule and takes part in various defense and immune responses, showed an up- regulation in p. gingivalis-infected aosmcs in both the microarray and qpcr results. this increase in gene expression was associated with an elevation in protein level, using western blot . hey <dig> is a downstream gene of notch <dig> in the notch pathway. we found that p. gingivalis increased the expression of this gene in aosmcs more than  <dig> fold, both in the qpcr and the microarray.

discussion
many risk factors have been identified to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. classical risk factors include high circulating levels of ldl, smoking, and low physical activity. however, up till 50% of patients with cardiovascular disease do not possess any of the classical risk factors  <cit> . it is believed that the immune system participates in the development of atherosclerosis and inflammation and infection have been considered as key factors  <cit> . increasing evidence has implicated that specific microorganisms, including the periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis, are involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. in this study, we focused on the interaction between p. gingivalis and vascular smooth muscle cells. we found, by using confocal microscopy 3d analysis, that p. gingivalis invades aosmcs, reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton and causes aosmcs proliferation, the latter considered as a key process in atherosclerosis. although, proliferative effects of p. gingivalis infection of smcs have previously been reported  <cit> , the mechanisms involved are uncertain. we used a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis and studied the gene expression profiling of smooth muscle cells after challenge with viable p. gingivalis, which gave us an insight of the effects of this periodontal bacterium on the vessel wall.

by using microarray analysis, we found that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in p. gingivalis–infected aosmcs, compared to uninfected control samples. in order to clarify whether genes contributing to cell proliferation are involved during p. gingivalis infection, gene ontology analysis was performed. we found that differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in the go categories, including positive regulation of cell proliferation for up-regulated genes and negative regulation of cell proliferation for down-regulated genes. in these two categories, growth factors and their receptors were enriched, such as heparin-binding growth factor  <dig> , platelet-derived growth factor subunit a , fibroblast growth factor receptor  <dig>  and beta-type platelet- derived growth factor receptor . interestingly, we also found a great number of genes belonging to notch and tgf-beta pathway. the result of spia analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes belonging to these two go categories are enriched in notch and tgf-beta pathway, so as the total up-regulated genes by p. gingivalis treatment . among the genes that were differently expressed by p. gingivalis, gucy1a <dig>  and gucy1b <dig>  are the top  <dig> up-regulated genes. both genes are associated with components belong to the downstream of notch signaling pathway  <cit> . furthermore, within notch signaling pathway, p. gingivalis up-regulated three notch receptors . notch signaling pathway regulates organogenesis and critical cellular processes such as cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation during heart development  <cit> . notch <dig> has been shown to play an important role in smcs proliferation, migration and survival. neointimal formation in notch <dig> general heterozygous knockout  mice was remarkably suppressed compared to wild type mice  <cit> . indeed, notch signaling also plays important role in the pathogenesis of common vascular proliferative syndromes including atherosclerosis and restenosis  <cit> . in addition, we found that the bhlh genes of the hes/hey families also were highly induced by p. gingivalis, including hes <dig> , hes <dig> , hes <dig> , heyl , hey <dig> , and hey <dig> . hes/hey familiy is identified as the target genes of various notch receptors  <cit> . in correlation, lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis has been shown to activate notch <dig> signaling and induce the production of hes <dig> and hey <dig>  <cit> . other target genes like jag <dig>  sdc <dig> and snai <dig> were also demonstrated to be up-regulatied  <cit> . all these results complement to the spia analysis, further demonstrating that the notch pathway is significantly activated in aosmcs in response to p. gingivalis.

we noticed that the tgf-beta pathway was also significantly activated in aosmcs by p. gingivalis. tgf-beta can cooperate with notch pathway in the regulation of smcs differentiation  <cit> . although the growth of normal human smcs is inhibited by tgf-beta, the growth of cells isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions is markedly elevated by tgf-beta pathway activation, accompanied by an increase in collagen synthesis  <cit> . in consent, previous reports have revealed in vivo, using balloon injury models, that increased levels of tgf-β <dig> signaling enhance the intimal thickness and induce smcs proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . through the activation of tgf-beta, the glycosaminoglycan synthetic machinery of aosmcs can be modulated and bind more ldl  <cit> . we also found that the gene of smad <dig> is highly induced by p. gingivalis and when smad <dig> levels are elevated, tgf-beta stimulates smcs to proliferate and accelerate neointimal formation  <cit> . in order to understand the association between tgf-β <dig> and smad <dig> and how they interact with other differentially expressed genes, we have visualized gene-gene interactions by geneanswers package . we found that there is a direct connection between tgf- β <dig> and smad <dig> through the tgf receptor type i . activation of the tgf-beta pathway leads to binding of tgf-beta to tgf receptor type ii , and then, this complex binds to tgfri, resulting in tgfri phosphorylation  <cit>  and activation of the downstream smad pathway. the smad pathway regulates the transcription of several target genes  <cit> , such as ctgf and elastin  . the results from geneanswers package also showed there is a crosstalk between smad <dig> and notch <dig>  this connection is due to the direct protein–protein interaction between notch intracellular domain  and smad <dig>  <cit> . due to the fact that the tgf- beta and smad <dig> are over-expressed after arterial injury, as well as the activation of notch pathway, we suggest that these signaling mechanisms are involved in p. gingivalis- induced differentiation and proliferation of aosmcs.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study suggests that the periodontal pathogen p. gingivalis stimulates aosmcs proliferation through activation of the tgf-beta and notch signaling pathways and thus enhances the progression of atherosclerosis, which further supports an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease.
