BACKGROUND
adaptation of the annual cycles of growth and dormancy to the local climate is critical for survival and competitive success of woody plants. such local adaptation has been described in several species, and it can be seen as clines in phenology traits, including the timing of leaf emergence, leaf senescence, and growth cessation  <cit> . this pattern reflects the trade-off between frost tolerance and enhanced growth  <cit> . cessation and initiation of growth determines the period of active stem elongation, mark the shift between frost resistant and vulnerable phases, and their timing is critical for overall biomass production, fitness and the long-term survival of species  <cit> . after height growth cessation and until leaves senesce, deciduous shrubs and trees, including willows and poplars, continue to be photosynthetically active and may accumulate considerable biomass  <cit> . in this phase, photosynthesis is critical to cold acclimation and survival in winter  <cit> . the timing of leaf senescence in autumn has a strong impact on nutrient retranslocation, reserve storage and the next early-season growth  <cit> . in addition, spring and autumn leaf phenology are evolutionary important traits for herbivore and pathogen resistance  <cit> .

decreasing photoperiod  is the main environmental cue inducing growth cessation and bud set in many perennial plants  <cit> , including poplar  <cit> . this response to photoperiod is under strong genetic control  <cit>  and is maintained when trees are moved between latitudes  <cit> . temperature, alone or in combination with photoperiod, also induces growth cessation in some tree species  <cit> . senescence and shedding of leaves are also influenced by photoperiod, often in interaction with temperature  <cit> . in poplars, leaf senescence is induced by shortening day-lengths but needs to be preceded by bud set. however, it is not clear to what extent senescence and bud set are under independent genetic control  <cit> .

after growth cessation, dormancy is initiated, which is a prerequisite for the development of cold acclimation and freezing tolerance  <cit> . dormancy release requires exposure to chilling temperatures  <cit> . light does not seem to play a role in this process, but once dormancy is broken, bud burst and growth resumption are regulated by temperature, light and photoperiod. growth resumption and bud burst depend on accumulation of temperature units over a specific threshold   <cit> . temperature is the most important factor regulating bud burst in temperate woody plants  <cit> , but photoperiod also plays a role in some populations and species  <cit> .

willows  belong together with poplars  to the plant family salicaceae. based on the fossil record the divergence of the two genera was dated to approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . willows and poplars share many characteristics such as dioecy, rapid growth and seed development, and ease with which they can be vegetatively propagated. they typically have a haploid chromosome number of  <dig> and similar genomes sizes of approximately  <dig> mbp. also there is strong syntheny and colinearity between willow and poplar genomes  <cit> . the salix genus shows a remarkable phenotypic diversity ranging from small shrubs to large trees. salix spp. have a global distribution in temperate and arctic regions and are adapted to a wide range of habitats  <cit> . relatively high levels of genetic diversity  <cit>  and the broad phenotypic diversity make them an excellent model system for studying evolutionary processes such as adaptation. moreover, willows have generally rapid growth and high biomass yields and these characteristics together with ease of vegetative propagation make them economically attractive as bioenergy crops. willows have been increasingly used in the last decades for biomass production worldwide and salix viminalis l. and s. schwerinii e. wolf and their hybrids are some of the most commonly used willows in the breeding programs in europe. these two species are dioecious and outcrossing and morphologically very similar. both are multi-stemmed shrubs with long and slender leaves and are commonly found along rivers and in other wet areas.

growth cessation in salix species is marked by the abscission of the shoot apex  <cit>  and is controlled by photoperiod  <cit> . large clonal variation in the time of leaf abscission has been observed in salix, and delayed leaf abscission was shown to impair leaf nitrogen retranslocation and to increase nitrogen losses  <cit> . extensive clonal and species variation in timing of bud burst has been observed in willow, mainly determined by differences in thermal time requirement  <cit> . moderate to high heritabilities have been reported for timing of bud burst and growth cessation in different s. viminalis families  <cit> .

phenology traits have a quantitative genetic background and thus qtl mapping is a powerful method to identify genomic regions controlling phenology traits. with a reference genome one can obtain information on the genomic content of the qtl regions. with the advent of high-throughput genotyping technologies and annotated reference genomes, genetic markers in evenly spaced genes throughout the genome can be developed and genotyped for the purpose of constructing dense genome-wide linkage maps.

here we studied the phenology of growth, including timing of bud burst, timing of cessation of elongation growth and leaf abscission in willows both in controlled and field conditions during multiple years. our two aims were to map qtls associated with phenology in salix, and to identify candidate genes in qtl hot spots through comparative mapping with populus trichocarpa. this was achieved by using a dense linkage map anchored to the annotated genome of p. trichocarpa and by constructing denser maps in the qtl hot spots.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation in phenology
in the s <dig> pedigree, planted in an experimental field in pustnäs, south of uppsala , the mean date for bud burst was 20th of april   <dig>  figure 1), the date of apex abscission  was 24th of september , and about 25% yellow leaves were left on the plants at the end of october . year-to-year variation was significant for all traits , and genotype ranking significantly changed across years  indicating different responses to seasonal variation between genotypes. in the indoor experiment, elongation growth ceased on average  <dig> weeks after progressive reduction of the photoperiod. after nine weeks of artificial winter in the indoor experiment, bud burst occurred after  <dig> weeks of increased temperature and day length, corresponding to  <dig> day degrees > 0°c .

qtl mapping
in total across experiments and years,  <dig> qtls were detected . qtls were named by the trait , environment , year of assessment, linkage group where it was located, and if multiple qtls were mapped to the same group, by an ordering number. on average about 40%  of the variation among genotypic means was explained by a general model including all the qtls that remained significant after backward selection. individual qtls generally explained a small proportion of the variance of the genotypic means. eleven qtls contributed to 7% or more of the trait variation,  <dig> qtls explained more than 15%, and  <dig> qtl explained up to 34% of the variation .

qtls for bud burst
for bud burst,  <dig> qtls were identified indoors and  <dig> in the field during two years of assessments. each of the qtls included in the final model explained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the variation in genotypic means . the final model including all qtls explained from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the observed variance depending on environment and year of assessment . no significant qtl by qtl interaction was detected for bud burst.

qtls for growth cessation and leaf senescence
for growth cessation,  <dig> qtls were identified indoors and  <dig> in the field during two years of assessments. the contribution of each qtl to the phenotypic variance was low to moderate  but all qtls together explained from  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the trait variation . for leaf senescence,  <dig> qtls were identified across the two years of assessment. the final model  explained  <dig> % of the trait variation in  <dig> and  <dig> % in  <dig>  the majority of qtls made a low contribution to the total variance  with the exception of lsf <dig> ii and lsf <dig> ii, which explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively .

comparison of qtl positions among years, environments and traits
qtls were considered to co-localize when their peak positions were less than  <dig> cm apart. twenty-eight qtls were identified only once while at  <dig> other positions at least  <dig> qtls were mapped. among the  <dig> regions where co-localizing qtls were found,  <dig> included  <dig> qtls for the same trait identified in  <dig> years or both environments,  <dig> included  <dig> qtls for different traits, and  <dig> included  <dig> to  <dig> qtls affecting different phenology traits .

for bud burst in the field, in five cases qtls appeared more than once at the same map position comparing the two years . in contrast, for growth cessation in the field, most of the qtls mapped to the same position both years . six genomic regions were detected for leaf senescence where qtl appeared both years .

in only one case were qtls involved in bud burst found at the same map location when comparing indoors and the field conditions . one qtl for growth cessation was only identified indoors while another two co-localized with qtls identified in the field .

improved mapping of two qtl hot spots for phenology on lg ii and lg x
the qtls on lg ii and x for bud burst, growth cessation and leaf senescence were confirmed with the new denser linkage map. a comparison of the qtl mapping with the linkage map from berlin et al.  <cit>  and the new maps is illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the peak position of the qtls was changed for all traits on lg ii while only to some extent for the growth cessation traits on lg x. the  <dig>  lod intervals of the qtls were considerable shortened with the new linkage maps . for the traits bbi and gcf <dig> the new analysis identified two qtls on lg ii for each trait instead of one as in the original analysis .

positional information of qtls and identification of candidate genes
we predicted the genomic interval for each qtl and summed all intervals for the traits, bbf <dig>  bbf <dig>  bbi, gcf <dig>  gcf <dig>  gci, lsf <dig> and lsf <dig>  this was possible by anchoring the snp markers to the p. trichocarpa genome. the total genomic intervals varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp for the traits  and the total number of gene models ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the largest number of gene models was found for bb <dig>  however, 39% is due to one qtl with a large  <dig>  lod interval on lg i. since some qtls covered the same genomic interval, some gene models appeared more than once, we therefore estimated the number of unique gene models for bb, gc and lsf to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . the total number of gene models in the intervals as well as the putative candidate genes for growth cessation are presented in table  <dig>  several putative candidate genes were identified among these gene models . candidate genes in the qtl intervals include photoreceptors as well as several circadian clock genes and downstream components. among photoreceptors both cryptochrome and phytochrome genes were identified . the phytochrome gene phyb <dig> was located in a narrow range between two qtls on lg x and should not be ruled out as a potential gene influencing growth control in willows. gene models within qtls also included several core circadian clock genes such as late hypocotyl , pseudo-response regulator  <dig> , lux arrhythmo , early flowering  <dig> , zeitlupe  and gigantea    <cit> . interestingly the ft <dig> gene is located in the proximity of the fine mapped region on lg x . noteworthy is that ptft <dig>  <cit>  and pttlhy  <cit>  are involved in the control of growth cycle in populus.

discussion
the present study explores the genetic architecture of growth phenology in a pedigree between s. viminalis and s. schwerinii. using a linkage map based on several hundreds of snp markers, we identified qtls for bud burst, growth cessation and leaf senescence in different years and environments. in the field, the qtls explained together more than 40% of the variation in each trait. several regions were identified where many qtls co-localized for different traits or for the same trait across years. since the snps were developed using the p. trichocarpa genome as a template, we obtained positional information for the salix qtls, projected them on the poplar genome, and identified the corresponding genomic intervals. the results suggest that some qtls might be homologous to populus qtls. moreover, in the projected qtl intervals we could identify putative candidate genes for the traits.

phenotypic variation
all phenotypic traits varied among the progeny. a large part of the variation was imputable to genetic factors, which confirms moderate to high broad sense heritabilities for bud burst and growth cessation in salix species  <cit> . although heritability estimates are known to be environment and population specific, it is now well established that bud phenology is under strong genetic control in salicaceae  <cit> .

the behaviour of the progenies changed between controlled and field conditions. growth cessation in short days indoors and apex abscission in the field displayed particularly weak correlations. one possible explanation to this discrepancy could be that the variation observed indoors only reflects a photoperiodic response, while the variation observed in the field could reflect effects of other environmental factors. in fact, short days alone can induce apical growth cessation both in seedlings and rooted cuttings of several salix species, while in field conditions, apical growth cessation does not seem to be regulated by photoperiod, but other factors seem to be involved  <cit> . in s. viminalis, the coincidence of growth rate decline and tip senescence with development of low leaf water potential in summer suggests an effect by water stress  <cit> .

the timing of phenological events changed across years, as shown by weih  <cit>  for other salix clones. in addition, the ranking of the clones changed from one year to another, which indicates a plastic behaviour in the family. this might represent a differential response among the progenies to the seasonal differences in rainfall and temperature observed between years . plasticity is crucial for a species to respond to the demands of a changing environment. an increasing number of studies indicate that temperature and stress factors may variably interact with photoperiod in controlling the timing of phenological events in woody species, including willow and poplar  <cit> . in s. viminalis, the effects of photoperiod seem to be superimposed on those of water stress in controlling apical growth cessation  <cit> . a drier and warmer summer, i.e. higher temperature sum, higher maximum temperatures and a greater number of dry days , might indeed be partly responsible for the markedly earlier growth cessation observed in  <dig> in this study. combined effects of photoperiod and temperature could be also responsible for the inter-annual variability observed for leaf senescence in our willow pedigree. in populus, yellowing of the leaves is initiated by a photoperiodic stimulus, but the progression of senescence is accelerated under low temperature  <cit> . moreover in populus, senescence seems to be faster in trees that have a late onset of senescence, independently on the effect of temperature. there is no data about regulation of seasonal leaf senescence in salix. however, if we hypothesize a similar regulation as in poplar, the smaller total phenotypic variation  and the more advanced stage of senescence observed in  <dig> compared to  <dig> could both be explained as an effect of lower temperatures  in october  <dig> .

qtls for phenology traits
the phenology traits were typically quantitative. several qtls were found for each trait of which the majority explained less than 10% of the total variation. this was not surprising and seems to be a common feature of phenological traits among many species in the salicaceae plant family  <cit> . indeed, the regulation of phenology is quite complex and involves different pathways  <cit> . when estimating the total phenotypic variation of all qtls for each trait we found particularly high values for leaf senescence, e.g. lsf <dig> explained as much as  <dig> % of the total variation. the total phenotypic variation explained by the qtls for the other traits was less strong but still substantial.

colocalization of qtls
at the level of resolution attained, there is considerably coincidence in map positions among a number of the qtls. the most striking instances are found on lg ii and x, where qtls with narrow confidence intervals for bb, gc and ls consistently mapped across years and environments are located at similar positions. the qtls on lg ii also co-locate with bud burst qtls found by tsarouhas et al.  <cit>  where they used a subset of the same willow pedigree and a different linkage map with some common markers . fine mapping with additional markers on lg ii and lg x further supported that qtls for all three traits might represent the same locus. similarly, on lg v, qtls for growth cessation and leaf senescence co-localized, on lg vi, qtls for leaf senescence and bud burst co-localized and on lg xiv qtls for bud burst and growth cessation were found at a similar genomic position. this suggests that pleiotropic effects of individual qtls on several traits could result from shared components of the pathways controlling the different traits. this is perhaps not unexpected given that both bud burst and growth cessation are both controlled jointly by photoperiod and temperature. the time of leaf senescence has been shown to be an important trait for seasonal acclimation as well as for biomass production in willows  <cit> . it generally occurs well after growth cessation, but data from populus tremula suggest that also the onset of leaf senescence is under photoperiodic control although it might respond to a different photoperiod than bud set  <cit> . the frequent co-localization of qtls for growth cessation and leaf senescence suggests that genes controlling growth cessation may to a large extent also affect the timing of leaf senescence. furthermore, the common qtls on some of the linkage groups suggest that these locations indeed contain genes with a central role in controlling seasonal growth in willows.

comparison of qtl regions between poplar and willows
when comparing the willow qtls with qtls found in poplar many qtls were found in similar genomic positions, which suggests common mechanisms controlling these traits in willows and poplar. rohde et al.  <cit>  mapped six narrow qtls for bud set in poplar to lg iii, v, vi and two on viii and xiii, and we find qtls for growth cessation or leaf senescence at five of these positions . fabbrini et al.  <cit>  identified several qtls for bud set in p. nigra of which those on lg i and iv overlap with qtls for growth cessation and leaf senescence in willows. frewen et al.  <cit>  mapped three qtls in poplar for bud set to lg iii, vi and x of which those on iii and vi was also identified in willows. there are also some major differences as for example the qtls on lg ii and ix in willows are missing in poplars. however the presence or absence of a qtl for a trait depends on several factors such as accuracy of the phenotyping, environmental factors and perhaps most importantly on whether or not the trait or gene is variable in the mapping population under study. in this study we have used one mapping population from a back cross between two species and how general these results are should be validated in another genetic background.

identification of positional candidate genes
comparative mapping with poplars represents a first step to further dissect the genetic basis of phenological variation in willows and ultimately identify genes or alleles responsible for the trait variation that we observe. our understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of the traits of interest very much define the success of this approach as it relies on previous identification of genes potentially involved in the control of the traits as well as on genome conservation between poplars and willows. we have previously shown that overall gene order is conserved between willows and poplars except for few large-scale chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> , which justify anchoring the salix qtls to the physical map of poplar. we started by estimating the number of genes within the qtls for each trait and found as many as  <dig>  genes for bud burst and about half the number of genes for growth cessation and leaf senescence. functionally characterized genes for phenology are still scarce in poplar apart from two examples. the poplar gene ptft <dig> located on lg x that is known to be involved in growth cessation  <cit> , was located close to the fine mapped region. lhy-genes have recently been shown to be involved in both growth cessation and budburst  <cit>  and lhy <dig> was located close to the qtl hot spot region on lg ii and lhy <dig> was located in a cluster of qtls for bud burst and growth cessation on lg xiv. the fine mapped region on lg ii contains a svp homolog. in perennial species svp genes have been shown to be involved in the growth cycle typically with high expression levels during bud dormancy  <cit> . the above-mentioned genes are strong candidate genes for growth cessation and bud burst that warrant further investigation in willows.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified substantial variation in all traits in the pedigree and all traits were associated with many qtls that each explained less than 10% of the variation, a typical pattern of quantitative characters. in total, we identified  <dig> qtls, of which some were clustered in hotspots where qtls for the different traits co-localised. two such hotspots on lg ii and x were further investigated by the construction of denser linkage maps in these regions, an effort that greatly reduced the qtl intervals . some qtls appear to co-localize with those found in poplars, which could indicate common pathways for these traits in salicaceae. this study is an important first step in identifying qtls and candidate genes for phenology traits in salix but further work is needed e.g. to confirm the qtls in other genetic backgrounds, further fine mapping and functional studies, to verify candidate genes.
