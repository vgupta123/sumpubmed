BACKGROUND
in normal brain, microglia possess a characteristic ramified morphology which facilitates continuous immune surveillance  <cit> . when the cns is damaged or infected, microglia undergo a phenotypic shift, altering their shape and expressing receptors that recognize endogenous and exogenous chemoattractants  <cit> . receptor-initiated signaling cascades enable microglia to execute rapid, directed migration towards affected tissue  <cit> . depending on the molecular species encountered, altered gene expression further adjusts the microglial phenotype towards pro- or anti-inflammatory  <cit> . directed microglial migration is a major cns defense and provides for homeostatic maintenance and tissue repair. dysregulation of migration and phenotype leads to excessive pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic responses implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . despite their importance, the mechanisms controlling microglial migration and phenotype remain poorly understood.

endogenous cannabinoid signaling regulates microglial migration via cb <dig> receptors and an unidentified gpcr, the 'abnormal cannabidiol'  receptor  <cit>  . the pharmacology of endogenous and phytocannabinoids is complex; well documented pharmacological evidence supports multiple cannabinoid receptor subtypes. two have been cloned, cb <dig> and cb <dig>  whereas others discriminated using pharmacological and genetic tools remain to be identified at the molecular level  <cit> . the 'abn-cbd' receptor is the most prominent of these receptors and has been implicated in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in isolated resistance vessels, haemodynamic responses and modulation of microglial, endothelial and glioma cell migration  <cit> . its defining characteristics are: activation by two synthetic isomers of cannabidiol , abn-cbd and o- <dig>  which are inactive at cb <dig> and cb <dig>  <cit> . other agonists include anandamide  and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol , but not palmitoyl ethanolamide   <cit> . cbd and n-arachidonoyl serine  are very low efficacy agonists behaving as partial agonists/antagonists depending on receptor expression levels; whereas another cbd analogue, o- <dig>  and rimonabant act as antagonists, although rimonabant does so only moderately  <cit> . the receptor is gi/o-coupled and its activation stimulates p44/ <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> .

n-arachidonoyl glycine  is an endogenous metabolite of aea, differing by the oxidation state of the carbon β to the amido nitrogen - a modification that drastically reduces its activity at cb <dig> and cb <dig>  <cit> . a wealth of data demonstrates that nagly triggers antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities  <cit> . several parallel pathways have been described for its synthesis  <cit> , it is hydrolyzed by fatty acid amide hydrolase   <cit> , and is a high affinity ligand for gi/o-coupled gpr <dig>  <cit>  and a partial agonist of gq/11-coupled gpr <dig> receptors  <cit> .

here, using the immortalized primary microglial cell line   <cit> , which have been shown to retain most of the morphological, phenotypical and functional properties described for freshly isolated active microglial cells  <cit> , we investigate the hypothesis that nagly and abn-cbd regulate microglial migration through gpr18; identifying gpr <dig> as the unknown 'abn-cbd' receptor. we demonstrate that nagly is the most potent pro-migratory lipid for bv- <dig> microglia described to date and its effects mimic those of abn-cbd at the 'abn-cbd' receptor. our data support the hypothesis that gpr <dig> is the 'abn-cbd' receptor and suggest that nagly is a primary means for initiating directed microglial migration in the cns.

RESULTS
nagly potently induces directed microglial migration
directed microglial migration and phenotypic modifications are known to be stimulated by factors including bacterial peptides, lysophospholipids and endocannabinoids  <cit> . therefore, we compared nagly-induced bv- <dig> microglial migration with n-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine  and archidonoyl lysophophatidic acid , chemotactic ligands released under conditions of brain injury or infection  <cit> . nagly potently induced concentration-dependent migration, and elicited a response twice that produced by  <dig> μm fmlp or lpa at nagly concentrations of  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm, respectively .

chemotaxis  is the process whereby cells sense soluble molecules and purposely advance along a concentration gradient to their source. this is in contrast to chemokinesis , where cells experience spontaneous cytoskeletal polymerization which prompts indiscriminate meandering. checkerboard analysis offers a means to differentiate migratory behaviour between chemotaxis and chemokinesis, and is based on disrupting the concentration gradient of a pro-migratory ligand. indiscriminate cell migration across a filter membrane will remain unaffected by the absence of a concentration gradient. whereas directed cell migration is prevented by the absence of the guidance cue derived from the concentration gradient. checkerboard analysis of nagly revealed bv- <dig> microglia exhibit chemotaxis, and purposely advance towards the source of nagly in a directed manner . a low basal level of chemokinesis was observed, which is the case with all established chemoattractants .

as nagly undergoes hydrolysis via faah to form aa and glycine  <cit> , both of which are signaling molecules in their own right, we investigated whether the nagly-induced response was due to its metabolism to either of these products.  <dig> μm nagly produced a migratory response  of  <dig> % ±  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for aa, and - <dig> % ±  <dig> % for glycine; these values are significantly different . this indicates that neither aa nor glycine can account for the migratory response produced in bv- <dig> microglial cells by nagly.

in  <dig>  walter et al described endocannabinoid system involvement in recruiting microglia toward dying neurons: pathological stimulation of neurons and microglia led to a dramatic and selective increase in 2-ag production which triggered microglial migration by engaging cb <dig> and 'abn-cbd' receptors  <cit> . therefore, we next compared nagly-induced migration to various endocannabinoids, endogenous lipids and compounds relevant to 'abn-cbd' receptor pharmacology to compare the potency of each of these compounds to induce migration . a response double that of  <dig> μm fmlp was elicited by the following concentrations of ligand:  <dig>  nm nagly,  <dig>  nm o- <dig>   <dig>  nm 2-ag,  <dig>  nm abn-cbd and  <dig> nm aea . pea , palmitoyl glycine , and l-α-lysophosphatidylinositol  all exerted a minimal, concentration-independent stimulation of migration. the mean migration achieved for these compounds across a concentration range of  <dig>  nm -  <dig> μm being  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % , and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . thus, nagly potently induced concentration-dependent migration of bv  <dig> microglia, and was more efficacious than previously described cannabinoid ligands . a ~50-fold greater concentration of 2-ag than nagly was required to reach the half-maximal response of 2-ag; and in terms of aea, a ~1000-fold greater concentration of aea than nagly was required to reach the half-maximal response of aea.

microglia in the adult cns derive chiefly from a self-renewing population or rarely are replenished from adult bone marrow  <cit> . as they invade an injured region of the cns, microglia can enter the cell cycle and proliferate via mitosis  <cit> , e.g. elevated numbers of microglia are found in brains of patients with multiple sclerosis  <cit> , alzheimer's disease  <cit>  and hiv  <cit> . the reduction of tetrazolium salts is widely accepted as a reliable way to examine cell proliferation. in the mtt reduction technique, the yellow tetrazolium 3-- <dig> -diphenyltetrazolium bromide  is reduced by metabolically active cells, in part by the action of dehydrogenase enzymes, to generate reducing equivalents such as nadh and nadph. the resulting intracellular purple formazan dye can be solubilised and quantified by spectrophotometric means. using this means to quantify cell proliferation in response to nagly, aea and 2-ag, we found that nagly increased the population of bv- <dig> microglia at picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations after  <dig> hours . the rank order of potency was nagly > 2-ag > aea at stimulating bv- <dig> cell proliferation: a ~50% increase was achieved by  <dig> nm nagly, which was significantly greater than the ~24% and ~21% seen with  <dig> nm aea and 2-ag, respectively  . decreased cell viability was observed for all three compounds at concentrations greater than  <dig> μm. carrier et al had previously shown that 2-ag, but not aea, exerted a m-csf  dependent proliferative effect on rat rtmgl <dig> microglia via cb <dig> receptors  <cit> . they observed ~30% increase with  <dig> nm 2-ag  <dig> hours after treatment, and this was accompanied by an increase in active p44/ <dig> mapk . mapks respond to extracellular stimuli/mitogens and regulate activities such as cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and death. as migration is an activated-mapk-dependent phenomenon and 'abn-cbd' receptors have been shown to induce p44/ <dig> mapk phosphorylation  <cit> , we investigated the effect of nagly on p44/ <dig>  p <dig> and jnk mapk enzymes using in-cell western assays . nagly induced a marked concentration-dependent phosphorylation of p44/ <dig> and jnk mapk , reflecting activation of these kinases, whereas, p <dig> mapk was only significantly activated by  <dig> nm nagly . our findings extend those of carrier et al, showing that nagly, 2-ag and aea independently induce bv- <dig> microglial mitosis, with nagly being the most potent of the three. given the association between cell migration and proliferation, and that both are mapk-dependent, 'abn-cbd' receptor-activated phosphorylation of p44/ <dig> and jnk mapk in response to nagly likely underlies the migratory and proliferative phenomena in bv- <dig> microglia.

in summary, the rank order of chemotactic potency published by walter  for bv- <dig> microglia was largely reproduced here. they found 2-ag > aea > abn-cbd at inducing migration, while pea caused a weak concentration-independent response  <cit> . here we report, nagly > o- <dig> > 2-ag > abn-cbd > aea, and the effects of pea, lpi and palgly were weak and concentration-independent . nagly is the most potent pro-migratory lipid for bv- <dig> microglia cells described to date, triggering directed migration and proliferation via mapk activation .

nagly acts via a gi/o-coupled gpcr
nagly-stimulated bv- <dig> microglial migration was concentration- and structure-dependent , implying a receptor-mediated mechanism. in light of the known importance of engaging cb <dig> and 'abn-cbd' receptors to trigger bv- <dig> migration  <cit> , the relationship of these receptors to nagly-induced bv- <dig> migration was investigated. the role of cb <dig> and cb <dig> receptors was examined using the antagonists/inverse agonists, rimonabant and sr <dig>  rimonabant and sr <dig> can block non-cb <dig> and non-cb <dig> targets when administered at concentrations greater than their kd values, i.e. in the micromolar range  <cit> . therefore,  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm rimonabant was used with the aim of distinguishing between a cb <dig> or a non-cb <dig> rimonabant-sensitive eceptor; while  <dig> nm sr <dig> was used to maintain cb <dig> selectivity. neither concentration of rimonabant had an effect upon nagly-induced migration, whereas sr <dig> caused ~ <dig> % inhibition of the response to  <dig> μm nagly . however, nagly does not demonstrate binding activity at either cb <dig> or cb <dig> receptors  <cit> . an alternative explanation is that sr <dig> is exhibiting inverse agonism at constitutively active cb <dig> receptors  <cit>  or blocking cb <dig> receptors involved in transactivation. this hypothesis is reasonable given that dual recruitment of cb <dig> and 'abn-cbd' receptors is required for 2-ag-induced bv- <dig> migration  <cit> , and sr <dig> effects on constitutively active cb <dig> are observed in other migratory immune cells  <cit> . to test this, bv- <dig> microglia were pre-treated with  <dig> nm sr <dig> before attempting to induce migration with  <dig> μm fmlp. fmlp is a tripeptide chemoattractant released from both bacteria and damaged mitochondria  <cit> , and activates two formyl peptide receptors, designated fpr and fprl- <dig>  <cit> . sr <dig> caused ~ <dig> % inhibition of the response to  <dig> μm fmlp . the estimated percentage viability ±  <dig> nm sr <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively; these values were not significantly different , excluding cell death as a factor. additionally, in subsequent experiments with hek <dig> cells, which do not express cb <dig> receptors, we found that  <dig> nm sr <dig> had no effect on hek <dig> cells stably transfected with gpr <dig> induced in response to  <dig> μm nagly; the migration being  <dig> ±  <dig> cells and  <dig> ±  <dig> cells in the presence and absence of sr <dig> respectively . these data instead infer a role for tonic cb <dig> signaling or transactivation in the migratory mechanism. interactions among gpcrs are complex  <cit>  and they have a propensity to experience cross-talk when co-expressed, e.g. receptor dimerization or heterologous desensitization. thus, cb <dig> may cross-modulate with fmlp receptors and the gi/o receptor targeted by nagly to regulate migration in bv- <dig> microglia. in summary, there is no evidence of a role for cb <dig>  which is consistent with the low levels of cb <dig> gene product previously observed in bv- <dig> microglia  <cit> . while cb <dig> is demonstrably involved in bv- <dig> migration, it remains questionable that nagly is signaling directly via cb <dig> receptors.

with regard to 'abn-cbd' receptors, the agonist profile we observed with bv- <dig> migration was consistent with that known for this novel receptor, i.e. abn-cbd, aea, 2-ag and o- <dig> stimulate migration   <cit> . however,  <dig> μm rimonabant failed to attenuated the nagly response despite a reported ic <dig> value of  <dig> nm toward 'abn-cbd' receptors   <cit> . whether or not total block with  <dig> μm rimonabant should be expected in this circumstance would depend on the affinity of nagly for the receptor, the concentration of nagly employed and the number of 'abn-cbd' receptors that need to be activated to see signaling; information that is not yet available. as a consequence, we further probed the role of 'abn-cbd' receptors by investigating the antagonistic effects of ara-s and o- <dig> on nagly- and fmlp-induced migration. in the presence of  <dig> μm ara-s or  <dig> μm o- <dig>  the migration induced by nagly was significantly attenuated , whereas the migration in response to fmlp remained unaffected;  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . these values were not significantly different, p >  <dig> ; one-way anova; n =  <dig>  likewise, neither ara-s nor o- <dig> had any effect on basal bv- <dig> cell migration;  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ±  <dig> % . similarly, these values were not significantly different, p >  <dig> ; one-way anova; n =  <dig> 

since nagly activates gi/o-coupled gpr <dig> and gq/11-coupled gpr <dig>  <cit> , we investigated the effect of pertussis toxin  on the nagly migratory response. ptx pre-treatment abolished the migration to nagly , without affecting cell viability. using the trypan blue exclusion method, the estimated percentage viability of cells pre-treated for  <dig> hours was not different . taken together these data indicate gi/o gpcr involvement, and support the hypothesis that nagly is acting via the 'abn-cbd' gpcr to induce bv- <dig> microglial migration.

bv- <dig> microglia express both gpr <dig> mrna and gpr <dig> receptors
our working hypothesis is that gpr <dig> is the 'abn-cbd' receptor and that its activation by nagly is a highly potent stimulation for microglial migration. for this to hold true, bv- <dig> microglia must express gpr <dig> receptors. indeed, qpcr demonstrates that bv- <dig> and primary microglia express abundant amounts of gpr <dig> mrna . in addition, immunocytochemical staining revealed gpr <dig> receptors are expressed in a heterogeneous punctuate pattern throughout bv- <dig> microglia and hek <dig> cells stably transfected with gpr <dig>  including their polymerized lamellipodia  <cit>  . lamellipodia are cytoskeletal actin protrusions on the mobile edge of a cell, believed to be both a steering device and the actual motor that pulls the cell forward during the process of chemotaxis  <cit> . microglia adopt an amoeboid-like form and extend such motile lamellipodia, in order to achieve directed migration, enabling them to move toward relevant cns locations and affect appropriate responses  <cit> . these data support our hypothesis that gpr <dig> mediates nagly-induced directed migration of microglia.

overexpression of gpr <dig> affects directed migration induced by nagly and abn-cbd
to further examine the hypothesis that nagly is acting through gpr <dig> to mediate its migratory effects in bv- <dig> microglia, and in light of there being no known gpr <dig> antagonists, we modelled bv- <dig> microglial migratory observations using wildtype or hek <dig> cells stably transfected with ha11-tagged gpr <dig> . nagly elicited a concentration-dependent migratory response in hek293-gpr <dig> but not wildtype cells , with an emax similar to bv- <dig> microglia.  <dig> h pre-treatment with ptx abolished the response to  <dig> μm nagly, the mean number of cells migrated with and without ptx pre-treatment was  <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> respectively; these values were significantly different .  <dig> μm nagly-induced migration was also significantly attenuated in the presence of  <dig> μm o- <dig> or  <dig> μm ara-s . abn-cbd and o- <dig> also induced migration in hek293-gpr <dig> cells, with o- <dig> being more potent than abn-cbd ; both responses were significantly inhibited in the presence of  <dig> μm ara-s or  <dig> μm o- <dig> , which again is in agreement with the bv- <dig> microglial data. cbd is known to behave as a partial agonist/antagonist of 'abn-cbd' receptors depending on receptor expression levels  <cit> .  <dig> μm nagly-induced migration of both bv- <dig> microglia and hek293-gpr <dig> receptors was also significantly attenuated in the presence of  <dig> μm cbd . the nagly-induced p44/ <dig> mapk activation observed with bv- <dig> microglia too was reproduced in hek293-gpr <dig> cells .

several publications have suggested the orphan receptor gpr <dig> interacts with certain cannabinoid ligands, including abn-cbd and o- <dig>  <cit> . while this proposition remains a contentious one, bv- <dig> microglia do express gpr <dig> mrna  <cit> . therefore we explored whether nagly, abn-cbd, o- <dig> or lpi stimulate migration in hek <dig> cells stably transfected with ha11-tagged gpr <dig> . all four of these compounds produced a weak, concentration-independent migratory response in hek293-gpr <dig> cells  that was irreconcilable with the nagly, abn-cbd and o- <dig> effects on bv- <dig> migration.

discussion
'abn-cbd' receptors have primarily been characterized in vascular tissue and microglia. studies investigating the vasodilatory effects of aea in cb1/cb <dig> knockout mice led to the postulation of the 'abn-cbd' receptor as a novel endothelial cannabinoid target for which aea, abn-cbd and o- <dig> were agonists that induced relaxation of the whole mesenteric arterial system  <cit> . subsequent investigations have elaborated that multiple signaling pathways underlie the hemodynamic effects elicited by aea, and involve cb <dig>  trpv <dig>  'abn-cbd' receptors and perhaps another distinct endothelium-independent abn-cbd/o-1602-sensitive target  <cit> . the specifics vary according to particular location in the vascular network and the preparation under scrutiny, e.g. aorta vs mesenteric artery segments, endothelium-intact vs endothelium-denuded vessels  <cit> . in  <dig>  well-executed studies with primary and bv- <dig> microglia reproduced the pharmacology of the endothelial 'abn-cbd' receptor, revealing its expression and significant migratory role in microglia  <cit> .

as a whole the cannabinoid field has eagerly awaited developments that will clarify the molecular identity of the 'abn-cbd' receptor. our analyses demonstrate that nagly and abn-cbd regulate cellular migration through gpr <dig>  and we propose this gpcr is the unidentified 'abn-cbd' receptor. multiple lines of evidence substantiate this hypothesis: nagly, at sub-nanomolar concentrations, together with the 'abn-cbd' receptor agonists abn-cbd and o- <dig>  <cit> , potently drives cellular migration in both bv- <dig> microglial and hek293-gpr <dig> transfected cells, but not in hek293-gpr <dig> or non-transfected hek <dig> cells. o- <dig> was ~ <dig> times more effective than abn-cbd at inducing migration in bv- <dig> microglia. this is in keeping with the work of jarái et al which first characterized 'abn-cbd' receptors in the rat mesenteric bed, where o- <dig> was ~ <dig> times more potent than abn-cbd at causing vasodilation  <cit> . 'abn-cbd' receptors couple via gi/o proteins  <cit> ; here, ptx pre-treatment to uncouple such gi/o proteins prevented the migratory response to nagly in bv- <dig> and hek293-gpr <dig> cells. the nagly-, abn-cbd-, and o-1602-induced migration was blocked or attenuated in bv- <dig> or hek293-gpr <dig> cells by the 'abn-cbd' receptor antagonist o- <dig>  and low efficacy agonists ara-s and cbd. nagly promotes proliferation and activation of mapk enzymes at low nanomolar concentrations in bv- <dig> cells and hek293-gpr <dig> cells, demonstrating cellular responses correlated with microglial migration and previous 'abn-cbd' receptor activity on p44/ <dig> mapk  <cit> . finally, bv- <dig> microglia show heterogeneous gpr <dig> immunocytochemical staining, including the polymerized actin-containing lamellipodia that permit motile cells to achieve directed migration, and abundant gpr <dig> mrna. qpcr demonstrates that primary microglia, likewise, express abundant amounts of gpr <dig> mrna.

both the academic community and pharmaceutical industry are engaged in intensive research of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling system, focussing on its potential therapeutic exploitation regarding mental illness, neuropathic and inflammatory pain, obesity, osteoporosis, nicotine addiction, cardiovascular disorders, and liver disease. therefore, our recognition of gpr <dig> as the unidentified 'abn-cbd' receptor has far-reaching implications. firstly, hitherto unrecognized gpr18-mediated effects by cannabinoid ligands, particularly those that were previously classified as cb1- or cb2-receptor-selective, may have resulted in the misinterpretation of the role of those receptors in various systems. secondly, our present definition and understanding of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling system will have to be expanded given the recognition of gpr <dig> as the 'abn-cbd' receptor and that its endogenous ligand, nagly, is a metabolic product of aea  <cit> . thirdly, elucidation of gpr18's other physiological roles will further reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for the detrimental and medicinal effects of cannabis constituents. lastly, gpr18-selective ligands will make available novel therapeutic routes targeting a broad spectrum of pathophysiologies.

with specific regard to the cns, microglia represent a major cellular component of the brain, constituting a widely distributed network of immunoprotective cells  <cit> . during the last decades, it has become clear that the roles traditionally ascribed to microglia, i.e. to dispose of dead cells and debris and to mediate brain inflammatory states, are only a fraction of a much wider repertoire of functions spanning from brain development to aging and neuropathology  <cit> . such functions are necessarily reliant upon the complex signaling systems subserving the reciprocal communication that occurs between neurons and microglia  <cit> . indeed, the loss of specific communication between damaged neurons and microglia is viewed as responsible for the turning of microglia to a hyperactivated state, which allows them to escape neuronal control and to give rise to persistent inflammation, resulting in exacerbation of neuropathology  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the marked potency of nagly acting on gpr <dig> to elicit directed migration, proliferation and perhaps other mapk-dependent phenomena advances our understanding of the lipid-based signaling mechanisms employed by the cns to actively recruit microglia to sites of interest. it offers a novel research avenue for developing therapeutics to elicit a self-renewing population of neuroregenerative microglia, or alternatively, to prevent the accumulation of misdirected, pro-inflammatory microglia which contribute to and exacerbate neurodegenerative disease.
