BACKGROUND
genome-wide mutagenesis and subsequent phenotype-driven screening has been pivotal to a complete understanding of how complex biological processes operate in classical model organisms including flies, nematodes, and plants  <cit> . the level of “saturation” in mutagenesis  has been shown to be a critical parameter for this approach to determine all relevant genes involved in a biological function, without prior knowledge of the gene products . in mammalian model systems, much effort has been expended to saturate, i.e., to disclose all the genes involved in some specific biological pathways. however, the relatively large scale and labor intensity of experiments have hampered the achievement of actual saturation mutagenesis, especially for recessive traits that require biallelic mutations to manifest detectable phenotypes . to overcome these drawbacks, the haploid mouse embryonic stem cell  system, in which a single-hit mutation can directly lead to phenotypic changes without being compensated by the second copy of the gene, has been recently developed , and reviewed in  <cit> .

here, to address the issues of mammalian saturation mutagenesis, we mutagenized the haploid mouse escs with the chemical mutagen n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  and subjected them to a phenotypic screening of mutants defective in various steps of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor  biosynthetic pathway.

RESULTS
the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway as a model target of screening
we chose the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway as a model target of phenotype-driven screening for a number of reasons. the gpi-anchor is a glycolipid that tethers many proteins to the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, forming a diverse family of molecules including hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, adhesion molecules and complement regulatory proteins  <cit> . the biosynthetic pathway is mediated by sequential additions of sugars and other components to phosphatidylinositol  . the cell surface expression of gpi-anchored proteins involves a total of  <dig> genes, which, with the exception of the x chromosome-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class a  gene, are widely distributed throughout the autosomes . clostridium septicum α-toxin selectively binds gpi-anchored proteins at the cell surface and kills host cells  <cit> . a defect in the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway does not affect esc proliferation per se <cit> , but a loss-of-function mutation in the pathway results in an α-toxin resistant phenotype, providing a platform for positive selection screening.figure  <dig>

enu mutagenesis
unlike some viral or transposon-based insertional mutagens, the dna alkylating agent enu can introduce a high rate of point mutations into the genome, irrespective of whether it hits active genes, inactive genes, or intergenic regions  <cit> . in the present study, we used two germline competent haploid mouse esc lines, h129- <dig> and hap- <dig>  <cit> . after the enrichment of haploid cells by flow sorting , h129- <dig> and hap- <dig> escs were treated with  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/ml of enu, respectively . for the purpose of further increasing the mutation rate, pretreatment with the alkyltransferase inhibitor o6-benzylguanine   <cit>  was also included in the experimental design. most cells were killed by these treatments  <cit> , and the residual surviving cells  were treated with  <dig> nm α-toxin to select for gpi-anchor pathway mutants.

a total of  <dig> resistant clones  were separately isolated and subjected to the previously described functional complementation assay  <cit>  involving transfection with various combinations of plasmids encoding the  <dig> candidate genes . as a reporter, we co-transfected escs with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein  fused with a gpi-anchor attachment motif . only when the mutated gene were exogenously restored did the cells express gfp at their surface, enabling mutants to be identified by their fluorescence. representatively, four esc clones were also analyzed by sanger sequencing and their causative mutations were detected in the corresponding gpi-pathway genes . eventually, all isolated  <dig> clones harbored at least one mutant allele  in any of  <dig> known genes involved in the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway .

among the  <dig> mutant esc clones, clone b <dig> exhibited fluorescence when transfected with a mixture of cdna-expressing vectors for all known gpi-anchor pathway genes , not when transfected with a single gene plasmid. a series of step-wise reductions in the repertoire of cdna-expressing vectors revealed that both dpm <dig> and pigv cdnas were essential to restore the fluorescence . sanger sequencing of genomic dna from the b <dig> esc clone identified causative point mutations of both genes . thus, the appearance of this double mutant in our screening suggests that the mutagenicity of enu is of a sufficiently high level for saturation mutagenesis.figure  <dig>

haploid escs have an inherent tendency to become diploid during culture . this process, autodiploidization, resulted in undesirable but inevitable contamination of the diploidized escs . in this study,  <dig> % of escs remained haploid at the point of enu treatment  and the rest were diploid. in the diploidized escs, because either of the duplicated x chromosomes could undergo x-inactivation or chromosomal loss, an enu-induced mutation on the other allele of the x-linked gene would immediately lead to a complete loss-of-function. this meant that, in the mixture of haploid and diploid escs, x-linked mutants would be more frequently obtained than autosomal recessive mutants. in the present study, prior to mutagenesis with enu, we introduced extra copies of human piga cdna into the h129- <dig> haploid esc line, but not into the hap- <dig> haploid esc line. as a result, x-linked piga mutants apparently dominated in the hap- <dig> esc population , whereas no piga mutants, but instead various other autosomal mutants, appeared in the h129- <dig> esc population.

pigg, pign, and pigq are known by their hypomorphic loss-of-function phenotypes  <cit> . consistently, a recent esc-based mutagenesis study using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -cas system also screened for the resistance to α-toxin and failed to obtain pigg, pign, and pigq mutants  <cit> . this suggests that, apart from these three genes and piga, the remaining  <dig> genes are essential for the maintenance of α-toxin sensitivity in our screening scheme. because the present mutagenesis study identified  <dig> of the  <dig> essential genes, this corresponded to a degree of saturation of 91%.

whole-exome sequencing for detection of mutations in haploid escs
the degree of saturation in mutagenesis largely depends on the mutagen. we examined  <dig> independent h129-2-derived mutant esc clones by whole-exome sequencing  and compared the results with those from enu-untreated parental esc clones . over 98% of the reads were successfully mapped to the ncbi37/mm <dig> mouse reference genome with a mean coverage of  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the exome regions were analyzed at >30-fold depth . given that each locus has in principle one allele, only mutations designated “homozygous” were taken into account by our wes analytical pipeline .table  <dig>

to filter out potential false-positive mutations, we adopted the following criteria: the mutations are only positive  when >90% of reads are called “alteration” in enu-treated mutant escs and >95% of the corresponding reads are called “reference” in enu-untreated control escs. these criteria were validated by the sanger sequencing of  <dig> “true-positive” mutations and  <dig> “false-positive” mutations in mutant clone f- <dig>  as a result,  <dig> of the  <dig> “true-positive” mutations were confirmed, and  <dig> of the  <dig> “false-positive” mutations were detected. one mutation thought to be “true-positive” but not detected by sanger sequencing was near the threshold line of our criteria. using fisher’s exact test, we obtained an extremely small p value , confirming the appropriateness of the above criteria for filtering wes data. yoshida et al. previously reported a true-positive rate of candidate mutations of only  <dig> % using wes data from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome   <cit> , indicating that the haploid nature of our mutant cells is advantageous for the accurate determination of mutations compared with diploid cells such as those of mds patients.

frequency and characteristics of enu-induced mutations
we detected 10– <dig> mutations in the  <dig> -mb exome region of each clone . the average number of mutations was  <dig> , representing an overall mutation rate of  <dig>  mb− <dig>  although these  <dig> clones were mutagenized with enu under the same conditions, the number of mutations diverged between clones for as yet unknown reasons. nevertheless, the overall mutation rate is comparable to that of previous reports  <cit> .

most  mutations were single-nucleotide substitutions   <cit> . among a total of  <dig>  single-nucleotide substitutions, the a:t base pair mutations  comprised similar proportions of transitions  and transversions , whereas the g:c base pair mutations  comprised a higher proportion of transitions  than transversions  . according to previous reports in mice including whole-genome sequencing data, enu-induced mutations were markedly biased toward mutations in a:t base pairs   <cit> , which is considered to be a serious obstacle for random mutagenesis. however, we observed a much smaller base pair preference for a:t  or g:c  at mutated positions within the exome. this may in part be reflective of a lower a:t content in exonic dna regions  compared with the entire genome . alkylating agents such as enu cause alkylation at the o <dig> position of guanine, leading to the g:c to a:t transition  <cit> , while an intrinsic repair mechanism mediated by o6-alkylguanine-alkyltransferase plays a key role in repair of o6-alkylguanine adducts. in this study, we pretreated haploid escs with the alkyltransferase inhibitor o6-bg. as a result, g:c to a:t transitions were predominantly observed, which contributes to a much smaller base pair preference between a:t and g:c. indeed, o6-bg was not used in the abovementioned reports  <cit> .figure  <dig>

we used snpeff software  to predict the impact of the mutations  <cit> . in brief, a “high” impact is that assumed to be disruptive to the protein; a “moderate” impact mutation is non-disruptive but might change the effectiveness of the protein; a “low” impact is unlikely to be accompanied by a change in the protein behavior; and “modifier” impact variants usually occur in introns or affect noncoding genes  <cit>  . this software classified one-half of the mutations as either “high” impact  or “moderate” impact  mutations, which narrowed down the list of candidate genes . thus, the analysis pipeline successfully confirmed responsible mutations in nine out of  <dig> mutant esc clones tested: seven harbored a point mutation of gpi-anchor pathway genes, categorized as high  or moderate  impact; one clone was confirmed to harbor point mutations that affected two genes  as described above ; and one harbored a large deletion encompassing all exons of the pigk gene . the rest  harbored a mutation in the sixth exon of pigo, which was undetectable because of an accidental omission in the ready-made exome capture design, so was instead confirmed by sanger sequencing . the high success rate in mutation identification is a prerequisite, though is not sufficient, for the detection of novel genes. our data demonstrate the major contribution of exonic mutations to the phenotypes  <cit>  and the effectiveness of combining wes with a haploid-based enu mutagenesis approach.

mutation rate for each gene depends on the coding sequence length
the efficient and unbiased nature of enu as a mutagen, combined with the haploid esc system, enabled a realistic experimental design of mammalian saturation mutagenesis screening to be performed in a resource-saving manner. as described above, we isolated  <dig> independent mutant alleles whose causative mutations covered  <dig> out of  <dig> gpi-anchor pathway essential genes. since most enu-induced mutations were single-nucleotide substitutions , we speculated that the mutation rate for each gene depended on its coding sequence  length. to confirm this, we plotted the number of mutant alleles for each responsible gene against its cds length , revealing a positive proportional correlation . this result was further validated by comparison with monte carlo simulation:  <dig> runs of  <dig> mutagenic hits were assigned to any of the  <dig> genes essential for the pathway with a probability proportional to their cds length . besides a few outliers, the experimental mutation rate for each gene was within the range of the simulation predictions, indicating the relevance of the cds length as a prime determinant of gene mutation rates in this system.figure  <dig>

modeling the experimental time course of the appearance of mutant alleles
we next attempted to trace the experimental time course of the appearance of mutant alleles by simulation. during the experiment, the number of mutant alleles obtained from α-toxin selection accumulated in a step-wise manner:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mutant alleles, which covered  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the essential genes, respectively. the experimentally-determined gene number at each step was compared with the expected gene number obtained by simulation. under the simplest assumption that mutation rates are identical for each gene, the expected gene number did not match the corresponding experimental result at each step . by contrast, under the current assumption that mutation rates vary proportionally to cds length, the expected gene numbers better fitted the experimental results . when the recovered allele number is accumulated up to  <dig>  the expected gene number will reach  <dig>  saturating all the known genes essential for this pathway . in other words, to achieve complete saturation, isolation of around  <dig> mutant clones will be required in this experimental setting.figure  <dig>

extended model for estimation of gene number in a biological pathway
finally, we extended this experimental and simulative study of enu mutagenesis to a general biological process. two critical prerequisites were a mutagenic scheme of random single-nucleotide substitutions and independent isolation of different mutant alleles. the former contributes to the assumption of the cds length-dependent gene mutation rates and the latter contributes to an accurate enumeration of the screened mutants. assuming that a variable number  of genes is essential for a biological pathway, the cds length for each gene can be assigned according to the distribution of cds length for all mouse genes deduced from the consensus coding sequence  database   <cit> . using the putative cds length as a parameter for the simulation, we plotted the expected numbers of covered genes against the cumulative numbers of isolated mutant alleles, where the essential gene number, n, varies from  <dig> to  <dig> in increments of  <dig> .figure  <dig> 
experiment-based prediction of essential gene number for a biological process.  kernel density estimation representing the distribution of cds length for all mouse genes.  regression curves of simulation results. plotting of experimental data, e.g., our present data , allows the prediction of the number of genes essential for a given pathway.



importantly, our experimental data  demonstrated a close fit to the simulated curve for n =  <dig>  which provides an accurate estimate of the number of gpi-anchor pathway genes. using the simulation curves, even a smaller-scale pilot experiment that screens as few as 30– <dig> mutant clones can provide an estimate of the essential gene number for a given biological process. this could serve as an advantage of enu mutagenesis because the cds length-dependent mutation rate is not applicable to other widely-used mutageneses such as gene-trap .

discussion
in this study, we examined the feasibility of “saturation” mutagenesis and screening for recessive traits in mammals by exploiting haploid mouse escs where single-allele loss-of-function mutations could immediately manifest their phenotypes. to obtain a high mutation rate, we used the classical alkylating chemical mutagen enu in conjunction with pretreatment with the alkyltransferase inhibitor o6-bg. mutations were screened by a plasmid-based functional complementation assay and were further assessed by wes. as a result, most exome mutations were single-nucleotide substitutions with little base pair preference, guaranteeing the randomness of mutagenesis in this approach. the haploid nature of the genome provided a significant advantage for reliable single-nucleotide variant  calling, compared with heterozygous snv detection in the diploid genomes. thus, the combination of the haploid esc system and wes, as two modern technologies, sheds a new light on the classical mutagenesis approach with enu.

an important contribution of this study is that we demonstrated the cds length-dependent allele frequency of each gene when mutated with enu. introducing the cds lengths as a parameter was a good way to simulate the gpi-anchor pathway-mutant screening that was based on the functional complementation assay using candidate gene-expression plasmids. this simulation principle could also be extrapolated to similar mutagenesis experiments for other biological pathways. most biological pathways have been comprehensively investigated and at least some of their genetic components are already known  <cit> . therefore, it is important to understand how many other relevant genes remain to be identified and when the screening would reach saturation. for this purpose, by taking advantage of the simulation results in figure 6b, the enu mutagenesis of haploid escs and a subsequent small-scale pilot screening experiment would provide a good estimate of the number of essential genes in a pathway of interest.

the wes analysis could also contribute to the construction of a list of candidate genes. in a recent review  <cit> , schneeberger notes that next-generation sequencing-based methods for mutation identification will soon replace other methods such as genetic mapping in forward genetic screens. the power of wes in detecting enu-induced mutations is also discussed, and the analysis of pooled genomes is recommended to manage large numbers of samples. indeed, considering the much higher accuracy of mutation identification achieved in haploid compared with diploid cells, deep-sequencing of pooled dna samples from multiple isolated clones may be a cost-effective way to identify mutations. typically it appears that when accumulating sequenced clones in a positive-selection screening approach, mutations will be enriched in a limited number of genes. further, the more often different mutations are found within a gene, the more likely the gene will be a target of the screening. notably, the mutant allele frequency should be normalized by dividing it by the cds length, such that a gene with a high mutant allele frequency and smaller cds should be given priority over that with a high allele frequency and larger cds.

in addition to the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway we used here, our screening strategy is applicable to many other experimental systems in which positive selection of mutant clones is available. at present, several biological pathways can be proposed as plausible targets for forward genetic screens, including mismatch repair genes   <cit> , genes involved in the exit from the pluripotency circuit of es cells   <cit> , genes involved in tumor necrosis factor  receptor  <dig> signaling   <cit> , and effector genes of extrinsic apoptotic stimuli   <cit> . furthermore, our strategy could be useful for investigating the pathways related to drugs and toxins with undetermined or partially determined mechanisms. for example, targets of the poly  polymerase 1/ <dig> inhibitor olaparib  <cit>  and effector genes of ricin toxicity  <cit>  are currently under investigation. many more compounds not yet examined could also be considered candidates of our strategy.

the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway has been extensively characterized , and the probability of new gene discovery is limited. in the present screening,  <dig> out of the  <dig> known essential genes were identified. identification of a 23rd gene will depend on its cds length. if this is similar to the average cds length of the other  <dig> known genes , the 23rd gene should appear among the isolated  <dig> alleles with a probability of >99% . if its cds length is shorter , its discovery probability is 64%. therefore, the 23rd gene, if it exists, is likely to have a shorter than average cds length otherwise its existence is less likely. indeed, the recent screening study using the lentiviral crispr-guide rna library identified no additional gpi-anchor pathway genes when the same concentration of α-toxin  was used for positive selection  <cit> . however, when a lower toxin concentration  was used, at least four additional genes, b4galt <dig>  1700016k19rik, cstf <dig>  and ext <dig>  were identified as modulators of α-toxin susceptibility, although they do not directly affect the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway. taken together, these results suggest that mutagenesis screening of the gpi-anchor biosynthetic pathway has almost been saturated with the  <dig> known essential genes.

the mutation numbers showed a marked variation and non-normal distribution  although the  <dig> clones were mutagenized with enu under the same conditions. thus far, we do not fully understand this phenomenon because, to our knowledge, there are no other reports of haploid cells being enu-mutagenized and their genome deep-sequenced. it could reflect the relatively small number of mutant clones examined in this study, but further investigation is necessary to clarify this because a skewed distribution of enu susceptibility may be a limitation of our method, which is based on the randomness of enu mutagenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, enu mutagenesis of the haploid mouse esc system allowed for a high level of saturation mutagenesis and recessive loss-of-function screening that would have been difficult to achieve in mammalian cells. wes analysis revealed that although enu randomly created point mutations in both genic and intergenic regions, nevertheless, most of the phenotype-causing mutations were clustered in exons, providing a rationale for the application of wes technology. importantly, enu-induced mutations affected each gene at a rate proportional to its cds length. this contributed to a reliable estimation of the number of genes essential for a pathway under investigation, by way of computational simulation based on a small-scale pilot experiment. this study opens up new opportunities for drug or toxin target screening.
