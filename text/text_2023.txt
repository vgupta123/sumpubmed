BACKGROUND
one of the most striking discoveries in the post-genomic age has been the amount of non-random gene positioning in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . in the human genome, for instance, highly/broadly expressed genes cluster  <cit> . likewise in yeast co-expressed genes tend to reside together  <cit>  and such pairs tend also to be retained together over evolutionary time more than expected, given the intergene distance between them  <cit> . blocks of broadly expressed mammalian genes also seem to be preserved over evolutionary time more than expected  <cit> . in caenorhabditis  <cit> , drosophila  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> , to name but three, there exists further evidence for expression clusters of some variety. these results all suggest that eukaryotic genomes are organised in a manner that permits co-expression or co-ordinate expression. evidence also suggests linkage of functionally related genes, although on this issue the evidence is more equivocal, not least because of an ambiguity as to what "functionally related" can mean. on the one hand, in numerous eukaryotic genomes, genes from the same metabolic pathway cluster more than expected by chance  <cit>  . likewise, linked co-expressed genes in yeast often fall within the same mips  category  <cit>  or the same gene ontology  classification  <cit> .

these results are so striking because they so profoundly overturn the long held assumption that genes are randomly located around eukaryotic genomes. this is not to say that possible exceptions were not considered prior to the sequencing of the complete genome. they were, however, typically dismissed as being unrepresentative or uninteresting either because they were clearly the product of tandem duplication  or were associated with weird genetics  or genes that are otherwise exceptional . not all such suggestive examples could so easily be dismissed however. here we concentrate on one class, linkage of ligands to their cognate receptors. this issue is worth systematic analysis, not least because in yeast it has recently been shown that genes whose proteins interact to form stable complexes are linked more often than expected by chance  <cit> .

that ligands and their receptors may be linked was observed independently by several workers. cooper  <cit> , noting that the linkage of ligands to receptors may be common, highlights the examples of transferrin and transferrin receptor on chromosome 3q, as well as apolipoprotein e and the low density lipoprotein receptor both on chromosome  <dig>  he also rightly cautions, however, than one can find numerous cases where ligands and receptors are not linked. similarly, lennard et al.  <cit>  note the linkage of the three ligands in the interleukin  <dig> cluster  to the two receptors  <cit> . the linkage of ligands to receptors has even proven to have some predictive power. wang et al.  <cit>  noticed that hepatocyte growth factor  and its met receptor were both on 7q. noting too the presence in 3p <dig> of both macrophage stimulating factor , and ron , they hypothesised that ron might be mst1's receptor  <cit> . this, in turn, they demonstrated to be the case   <cit> . popovici et al. note several of the above examples and also point to a total of  <dig> incidences of linked genes involved in the same pathway, not necessarily as ligand-receptor couplings  <cit> .

this evidence prompts two questions. first, is it true that there is something odd about the linkage patterns of ligands and their cognate receptors? second, if it is true, why might this be so? prior authors have also suggested that linkage of ligands to receptors might be functionally important. haig  <cit> , observing two of the above cases , notes that close proximity could enable linkage disequilibrium between alleles at the ligands and receptors. this linkage disequilibrium would potentially enable the spread of rare allele combinations for which there exist particular epistatic interactions. these may, haig suggests, act as selfish maternal effect lethals, an example of which has been described in mice  <cit> . this theory may be seen as a special case of a more general theory for linkage based on preservation of linkage disequilibrium under epistasis  <cit> . one might also conjecture that ligands and receptors might at times need to be co-expressed , so very close linkage might be beneficial for this reason as well.

if selection does act on the location of ligands and receptors , then we should predict, from the above models, that when two such genes are on the same chromosome they should also be, on average, physically closer than would be expected by chance. to this end we ask two questions. first, is the mean distance between ligands and their linked receptors shorter than expected by chance? as this mode of analysis could miss an excess of cases with very tight linkage, we additionally ask whether the number of incidences of linkage within a given window size  is higher than expected by chance.

RESULTS
no evidence for close proximity of ligands and receptors
if ligands and their cognate receptors were under selection to be in close physical proximity, we should find that the mean distance between them should be smaller than expected by chance. to test this, we examined ligand-receptor pairs from the dlrp database  <cit> . all analyses were also performed for an augmented dataset, which additionally contains two 'cherry-picked' cases highlighted by cooper  <cit>  . contrary to expectations, the mean distance between ligand and receptor in the non-augmented data set  is higher than that found in randomized genomes . the same pattern is found in the augmented data set . note that a ligand can have many receptors and that this is factored into the analysis through the randomization protocol.

it may, however, be the case that there exist a number of ligand-receptor pairs that are much closer to each other than expected. to examine this we compared the number of ligand-receptor pairs within some critical distance of each other and compared this with the number expected by chance. in these simulations we permuted genes only within the chromosomes within which they are found, so as to ensure that the number of ligand-receptor pairs were the same in the randomized sets as in the real data set. as can be seen  in neither data set do we find evidence for anything other than a pattern of random linkage .

it has been previously established that broadly expressed genes cluster  <cit> . might our simulations have produced misleading results by permitting genes of the ligands and receptors to reside in any chromosomal location? to examine this possibility we considered randomizations in which genes are swapped exclusively with ones of the same breadth of expression. none of the above results are qualitatively affected . using a different bin size to classify breadth of expression appears to have no effect on the results . likewise, permitting ligands and receptors to be located in the genome at the locations of other ligands and receptors does not affect any conclusions .

the above results indicate that there is no evidence for selection for clustering of ligand and receptor. for this reason we reject a model positing epistasis between alleles of ligand and receptor as a general force acting on genomic location of these genes. moreover the lack of tight clustering suggests that we are not witnessing clustering to enable co-regulation . the model suggested by haig  <cit>  is not, however, necessarily falsified by the above results, as he postulates selection on disequilibrium only if the genes might be involved in maternal-foetal interactions. such a model is hard to falsify in the absence of segregation/viability data from appropriate haplotypes. however, we can note that if we further restrict our data sets to those in which either the ligand or one of the receptors is placentally expressed, the qualitative patterns described above are unaltered . we find, therefore, no evidence for close linkage of ligand and receptor when involvement in maternal-foetal interactions might be a possibility.

an excess of ligand-receptor pairs on the same human chromosome
above we asked whether ligands and their receptors are more closely linked than expected by chance. we can also ask if ligands and their receptors are more commonly linked  than expected by chance? in an unbiased unaugmented human data set  we observe  <dig> such pairings but expect on average  <dig>  . when we include the two extra sets the p value, as expected, is reduced: we observe  <dig> pairs but expect on average  <dig>  . these results support the view that in the human genome linkage of a ligand to at least one of its cognate receptors is more common than would be expected by chance. however, the majority  of ligands are not linked to any of their receptors, so this excess should not be considered a strong rule .

no evidence for an excess of ligands-receptor pairs on the same chromosome in mouse
to ask whether the patterns observed in the human genome are also found in the mouse genome we constructed three mouse data sets and applied the three randomization protocols to each. the first two data sets are the ortholog equivalents of our two human data sets purged of duplicates by either a) blasting or b) blasting and removal by physical proximity  of ligands or receptors. that is, if two ligands were in close proximity in the human genome, even if not identified as sequence related, we would remove one before considering the location of the mouse orthologs. however, as it is possible that some ligand clusters might be unique to mouse, we additionally purged the more stringent of the above two of any groupings of ligands or receptors seen in the mouse genome.

as it happens, no matter which data set one employs or which randomization method is performed, there is not even a remote hint that ligands and cognate receptors occur more commonly on the same mouse chromosome than expected by chance . for example, in the equivalent of the human data set purged of duplicates by blast alone, we observe  <dig> ligand-receptor pairs on the same chromosome and expect  <dig>   in a randomization in which the ligands and receptors can assume any genomic position currently associated with a gene. in this analysis the mean distance between ligand and receptor is  <dig>  mb but is  <dig>  in the randomizations . at no specified distance do we find more pairs than expected by chance . controlling for breadth of expression makes no difference to this conclusion . the list of linked genes from the data set equivalent to the human set presented in table  <dig> is presented in table  <dig>  in this set  <dig> ligand-receptor pairs co-occur on the same chromosome, with  <dig>  expected. only four ligand-receptor pairs are in common in the two comparable data sets.

explaining the data: interesting biology or statistical artefact?
we find no evidence in mouse or man that ligands and their receptors are more closely linked on average than expected by chance. however, we do find that there are more ligand-receptor pairs on the same human chromosome than expected, a feature not found in mouse. from the above results we are faced with two possible explanations for the human data. first, that it is just a statistical blip, possibly owing to some subtle bias in the original data set . second, that the excess of ligand-receptor pairs on the same chromosome is the product of some deterministic force, that for some reason does not apply, or is not strong enough, in rodents. this might either be direct selection favouring the persistence of co-occurrence or a deterministic bias in the creation of co-occurrence.

that the pattern is found in humans rather than mice argues against a direct selective benefit for co-retention on the same chromosome. this is owing to the fact that the effective population size of the human population is most probably much smaller than that of mice. as such, according to the nearly-neutral theory, the efficacy of selection should be higher in mice . hence, if the pattern was owing to selection directly favouring co-occurrence, it is more likely to be observable in mouse rather than human, all else being equal. moreover, it is also hard to see what direct selective benefit might accrue from co-occurrence in weak linkage. in particular, co-regulation of ligands and receptors  would likely require much tighter linkage than observed here. we also find no evidence for a stronger similarity in the breadth of expression of the linked ligands and receptors than those on different chromosomes. we considered the difference in breadth of expression between ligand and receptor normalised by the mean of the two. linked genes are of no more similar breadth of expression .

segmental duplication and the balance hypothesis: an alternative hypothesis for non-random gene order
a notable feature of our data set is that there are numerous cases in which a ligand-receptor pair in linkage is matched by at least one other paralogous pair also in linkage. if we define genes belonging to the same hovergen  <cit>  family as paralogs, then we can identify the following linked paralogous pairs from table 1: hgf/mst <dig>  with met/ron ; dll1/dll <dig> with notch3/notch4; fgf1/fgf <dig> with fgfr3/fgfr4; fgf8/fgf <dig> with fgfr1/fgfr <dig> . note too that fgf <dig> is linked to fgfr <dig> and to fgf <dig> and is sequence related to fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> 

it has been argued that co-paralogy of gene pairs involved in the same pathway  appear to be unusually common  <cit> . this finding is also in accord with much recent evidence suggesting that the human genome  may be a mosaic of old large block duplications  and/or the result of whole genome duplications  <cit> , with several of the above paralogous groups being claimed to be the result of such duplication events: fgfr  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are in paralog clusters on human chromosomes 8p, 10q, 4p, and 5q respectively  <cit> ; notch  <dig> and  <dig> also appear to be in paralog clusters on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  with notch  <dig> and notch  <dig> being two further duplications of the same block  <cit> ; hgf/mst <dig> and met/ron were also previously described as belonging to co-paralogous groups  <cit> .

following an earlier hypothesis  <cit> , we would like to suggest an hypothesis to explain our results that is based on the occurrence of block duplications  <cit> . if some ligands and receptors require an appropriate balance in their titres, then one could expect that a mutation resulting in a block duplication containing one of the pair  might be more likely to spread through the population if it also duplicates the other . such co-duplication is most likely if ligand and receptor happen to be linked, while unlinked ligand-receptor pairs are less likely to be successfully duplicated. our hypothesis may be considered as being a form of the balance hypothesis  <cit> , which supposes that proteins involved in mutual interactions need to have their titres appropriately balanced. direct evidence for this proposition has been described in yeast, in which it is also reported that the need for balance might explain the lack of duplicability of the genes involved in complex formation  <cit> .

this hypothesis appears tenable in the current context for several reasons. it is, for example, suggestive that the paralogous pair sets tend to be more closely linked, although the statistic is on the edge of significance . this would be expected if constraints exist on the upper size limit of the block duplications. it may also be notable that for the many of the above genes there is evidence for dosage sensitivity, as required by the balance hypothesis . moreover, as re-arrangements tends to be especially common in mice  <cit> , any linked pairs possibly generated by block duplication are more likely to be split up, making the genome more like random.

*note: these five genes are known to be associated with human autosomal dominant disorders. searching omim  <cit>  for mapped genes with "autosomal dominant" somewhere in the title or the text and not "recessive" in the title, reveals an estimate of  <dig> mapped genes which may be associated with autosomal dominant disorders. assuming  <dig> autosomal genes  we should then have expected from a random sample of  <dig> autosomal genes less than one dominant, significantly less than observed . however, in some cases the dominance is owing to negative mutations rather than dose per se.

the above hypothesis also predicts that ligands and their linked receptors might be duplicated at the same time. while this can be approximately established by phylogenetic methods, these do not constitute a perfect test, as they fail to establish whether the pairs were duplicated in a block together and furthermore, genes known to be co-duplicated are very commonly not identified as such by phylogenetic methods  <cit> . nonetheless, we have surveyed the available data and prior analyses and fail to find any data that contradicts the hypothesis that when a given receptor duplicated the relevant ligand did as well . the ligands fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> are, however, probably the result of an ancient duplication that occurred independent of the receptor  <cit> .

in some of the incidences reported here, a case for co-duplication has already been made. the linkage of the fgfs to their receptors has previously been argued, from phylogenetic data, to be owing to block or whole genome duplications  <cit> . this view is supported by our inspection of the phylogenetic tree of the fgfr family as presented in hovergen  <cit> , which suggests that at the base of the vertebrates there was one receptor which duplicated to produce the ancestors of fgfr1/ <dig> and fgfr3/ <dig>  duplication of both ancestral sequences then occurred very shortly after , leaving fgfr <dig> and fgfr <dig> as nearest paralogs, and frgr <dig> and fgfr <dig> as nearest paralogs. if there was co-duplication of the receptors, we should expect to see fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> as nearest paralogs and frf <dig> and fgf <dig> as nearest paralogs, with, in both incidences, duplication occurring near the base of the vertebrates. the nearest paralog relationships are indeed upheld  <cit> . furthermore, in both instances the duplication occurred prior to the divergence of fish, as predicted.

CONCLUSIONS
in sum, we have described a novel pattern of co-localisation on the same chromosome of genes whose products interact, which cannot obviously be accounted for either by known models for co-ordinate regulation, nor by selection for linkage disequilibrium. the pattern may in part reflect a past history of block duplication. a version of the balance hypothesis is worth considering as underpinning to explain the results.

tests of this hypothesis should be possible in the future. we should in principle be able, with fuller knowledge of gene order in many mammals, to reconstruct the past history of duplication and gene order re-arrangements that occurred through mammalian history. the model predicts an excess of block duplications in which both ligand and cognate receptor are found, as well as excess in which neither are found, but a dearth of those with one, but not the other. the model also predicts a general weakening of this initial signal with increasing numbers of inter-chromosomal re-arrangements, as the hypothesis proposes only an initial filter of block duplications, not ongoing direct selection to maintain linkage.
