BACKGROUND
massive parallel sequencing has revolutionized the search for sequence variants in the human genome as well as other model organisms. compared with the sanger method, these so-called next-generation sequencing platforms can sequence dna much faster and at a much lower cost
 <cit> . the resequencing of an entire human genome can now be achieved within days at the cost of a few thousand dollars. in spite of such dramatically improved performance, the current technology does not allow routine screening of the complete genome for a large number of samples in an economically-efficient manner
 <cit> . even when the cost of whole genome sequencing breaks the much-anticipated $ <dig> threshold, the necessary computational workload could still remain burdensome and limit its widespread implementation outside major genome centres. in comparison, targeted sequencing is less expensive and generates datasets several orders of magnitude smaller
 <cit> . in recent years, exome sequencing  has therefore become a favoured approach in identifying sequence variants causing rare as well as common human diseases
 <cit> .

over the last few decades, the mouse has emerged as a preeminent model organism for exploring human biology. since over 90% of known mouse genes have an orthologue in the human genome, identification of genetic defects responsible for certain phenotypes in mice can directly indicate the genes involved in human diseases. recently, given the success of exome sequencing in identifying human disease-causing variants, hybridization-based exome capture systems have been developed for mouse and are now commercially available
 <cit> . the current design of mouse exome capture probes is based on the genome reference sequences of the c57bl/6 j strain and the robustness of applying such systems in other strains has been shown in a study that mapped putative n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea -induced mutations in four different inbred mus musculus strains
 <cit> . however, the marginal differences between the genomes of c57bl/6 j and the other strains used in that study do not allow for a systematic evaluation of the effects of sequence divergence on the efficiency of sequence capture and variant detection. in addition, the effect of sequence divergence could be even greater in a mixed genetic background.

the genome of the spret/eij strain has recently been sequenced. compared with that of c57bl/6 j, the genome of spret/eij contains about  <dig>  million single nucleotide variants  and  <dig>  million insertion and deletions 
 <cit> . in this study, to gain a better understanding of how sequence divergence could affect the efficiency of the current exome capture system, especially in a mixed genetic background, we performed exome sequencing in a f <dig> hybrid mouse generated by crossing the two strains with a high degree of sequence variation. after mapping the sequencing reads separately to the genomes of the two parental strains, we observed that probes captured the sequences derived from c57bl/6 j alleles more efficiently and the bias was higher for target regions with greater sequence divergence. such bias also reduced the efficiency of variant detection which could be counteracted by higher sequencing depth.

RESULTS
exome capture
to evaluate whether sequence divergence could affect exome capture, especially in a mixed genetic background, we performed exome sequencing on a f <dig> hybrid mouse derived from crossing c57bl/6 j and spret/eij mice using an agilent sureselect xt mouse all exon kit . with a design based on the genome sequences of c57bl/6 j strain , the kit contains  <dig>  probes of length  <dig> nucleotides  that are targeted at the exonic regions of  <dig>  genes. among all the target regions, we could unambiguously identify orthologous regions in the spret/eij genome for  <dig>  targets . to control for complicating factors beyond exome capture bias, we simulated three exome sequencing datasets without any allelic bias in capture efficiency . furthermore, we performed whole genome sequencing  on the same f <dig> hybrid mouse. only the  <dig>  targets that did not show significant allelic bias in sequencing depth from either simulation or wgs were retained for further analysis . among these targets the sequences of  <dig>  targets are identical between the two strains, whereas the remaining  <dig>  targets contain up to  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels .

in total, we performed three replicate exome capture experiments, each of which being then sequenced for single-end  <dig> nt on one single lane of the illumina hiseq  <dig> flowcell. an average of  <dig>  million reads was generated from each replicate, among which  <dig> % could be mapped to the genome of either strain . between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million non-redundant reads mapped to the  <dig>  target regions were used to assess the allelic bias in capture efficiency . more specifically, for each of these targets, we calculated the number of reads that could be mapped only to the c57bl/6 j or spret/eij genome. as shown in table 
 <dig> and figure 
2a, the reads mapped only to c57bl/j alleles were clearly overrepresented. the fact that such bias did not exist in the simulation or wgs data indicated the probes captured the target sequences derived from c57bl/j allele more efficiently .

assuming that the allelic capture bias observed above was largely due to the sequence divergence between the two strains, we assessed the impact of sequence divergence in greater detail. here we checked the effect of snvs and indels, separately. in total,  <dig>  targets containing no indels between the two strains were grouped based on the number of snvs. as shown in figure 
3a, compared with those targets with identical sequences, the targets containing snvs showed significant capture biases toward c57bl/j. the more snvs the targets contained, the higher the bias was observed . interestingly, the distribution of multiple snvs within the target regions also had an impact on the capture bias . furthermore, a clear effect on allelic bias could also be seen for indels by comparing the targets containing indels to those containing the same number of snvs, but no indels . notably, such biases did not exist in simulation or wgs data .

variant detection
we next sought to check whether the capture bias would affect the efficiency of variant detection. for this purpose, we mapped the exome sequencing reads only to the c57bl/6 j genome and aimed to identify the heterozygous variants derived from the spret/eij allele. using our mapping procedure, the sequencing reads derived from spret/eij allele containing > <dig> snvs and indels could not be mapped on the c57bl/6 j genome. since we focused on the effect of capture bias, we first needed to filter out the target regions that could be potentially affected by such mapping bias. to identify these specific regions, we mapped the simulated exome sequencing reads to either both genomes together or to only the c57bl/6 j genome. the numbers of sequencing reads that could be mapped using these two strategies were then compared for each of the  <dig>  targets. mapping bias was indicated if more reads could be mapped based on the ‘two genome approach’. to exclude the effect of mapping bias, we retained only the  <dig>  targets on which the number of reads mapped using the two mapping strategies was the same in all the three simulated datasets. in total, there were  <dig>  snvs and  <dig> indels falling within these targets and the distribution of the number of snvs and indels across these targets were shown in figure 
 <dig> 

we called variants within these targets based on the three exome sequencing datasets . given the relatively limited performance of current variant callers on the indel identification, we focused our analysis on snvs. as shown in figure 
 <dig>   <dig>  snvs were identified in all the three replicates, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were only found in two and one replicates, respectively. of the  <dig>  snvs present in the spret/eij genome reference sequences,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % could be identified in at least three, two and one replicates, respectively. a total of  <dig> snvs identified in at least one replicates were not found in the spret/eij genome reference sequences. these variants could represent false positive findings. however,  <dig> and  <dig> of them could be detected in three and two replicates, respectively, implicating that they might be true variants but absent in the reference sequences. indeed,  <dig> were annotated as mouse snps in sanger database 
 <cit>  and  <dig> could also be detected using our wgs data.

we achieved an average sequencing depth of  <dig>  for all nucleotide positions within the  <dig>  targets using one lane of a single flowcell. 98% and 100% of all the positions were covered by more than  <dig> and  <dig> sequencing reads, respectively. of note, such a sequencing depth was sufficiently high to discover most  of the variants even though the exome capture was biased against variant carrying alleles. therefore, we then addressed how the variant detection would work at lower sequencing depth and whether the exome capture bias could then have an effect on variant detection. we randomly sampled a subset of reads from the first exome sequencing replicate to cover the targets at an average sequencing depth of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. as expected, the sensitivity decreased with the reduced sequencing depth. we then grouped the targets based on the number of snvs they contained. as shown in figure 
6a, at a lower sequencing depth, the sensitivity was lower for the targets containing more snvs. for example, at average depth of  <dig>  whereas a sensitivity of  <dig> % was achieved for the targets containing only one snv, the sensitivity for the targets with four snvs dropped to  <dig> %. a similar trend was not observed for simulated data, implicating the decreased sensitivity was largely due to capture bias .

in this study, on one hand, to avoid the effect of mapping bias, we focused our analysis only on the targets containing no more than  <dig> snvs and  <dig> indels. as shown in the previous section, the greater the sequence divergence, the higher capture bias was observed. therefore it is conceivable that the efficiency in variant detection could be even lower for the targets with higher sequencing divergence. on the other hand, we used the capture system to detect heterozygous variants in a f <dig> hybrid mouse. for many research projects that work on pure inbred strains and/or only search for homozygous variants, the effect of sequence divergence might be more subtle than what has been demonstrated here.

CONCLUSIONS
with the enormous progress in the field of human genetics, exome capture systems have been developed to search for phenotypically-relevant mutations in mice. unlike the human genome in which sequence differences among individuals are rather limited, the sequence divergence between different mouse strains could be substantial. however, it had not been extensively explored whether the sequence divergence could affect the efficiency of hybridization-based capture systems designed based on a reference genome  when applied in the study of distantly-related strains. in this study, we performed an exome capture and sequencing on a f <dig> hybrid mouse generated by crossing the c57bl/ <dig> j and spret/eij strains. our results clearly demonstrated that the probes captured the sequences derived from c57bl/6 j alleles more efficiently and the bias increased for the target regions with higher sequence divergence. this bias also affected the efficiency of variant detection. the effect, however, could be counteracted by increasing sequencing depth. for example, to achieve a 99% detection sensitivity, an average sequencing depth of  <dig> or  <dig> would be required for the regions containing one or four snvs. therefore, in the design of exome sequencing in different mouse strain backgrounds, sufficient sequence depths need to be planned to match the sequence divergence between the strain and c57bl/6 j.
