BACKGROUND
the analysis of an increasing number of complete genome sequences has allowed in-depth studies of the role of sequence redundancy in genome evolution  <cit> . gene duplication has been considered for a long time to be a source of novel functions, and to have played a significant part in genome functional evolution and species divergence. hypotheses on the evolution of genes duplicated by whole genome duplication , segmental or local events were proposed in  <dig> by ohno  <cit>  and models for the evolution of these duplicated genes have since been elaborated. following the unexpected observation that arabidopsis thaliana is a paleopolyploid, a whole genome duplication  having occurred some 35- <dig> million years ago   <cit> , it was shown that extant plant genomes probably all result from successive cycles of wgd/diploidization  <cit> . major losses  <cit> , structural and functional divergence  <cit>  or concerted evolution  <cit> , have all been observed in eukaryotic genomes, in particular after whole genome duplication events.

analysis of the complete sequences of the genomes of rice  subspecies indica and japonica suggested two independent duplications: a wgd that occurred between  <dig> and 94mya, and which is thus common to all cereals, and a more recent segmental duplication between the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the relative chronology of this latter duplication and speciation events within the oryza genus are unclear. it was first identified by genetic  <cit>  and physical mapping  <cit> , with an estimated length of  <dig> - <dig> mbp. other authors, using synonymous substitution rates between conserved gene pairs for dating, described a duplication of  <dig>   and  <dig>  mbp  5mya  <cit> ,  <dig>  mbp  <dig> mya  <cit> ,  <dig>  mbp 20mya  <cit>  or  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp 21mya  <cit> , while goff et al.  <cit>  calculated 25mya using protein/protein alignments. according to gaut  <cit> , the divergence between erhartoideae  and the other pooideae  is approximately 46mya. molecular dating places the divergence of the oryza-leersia clade with other genera at ~20mya, that of the oryza and leersia genera at  <dig> mya, and divergence of the most basal species in the genus  at ~10mya  <cit> , in agreement with fossil reports  <cit> . recent data using other genes has confirmed this divergence time  <cit> . the evolutionary dynamics of the duplication have been studied between the two subspecies o. sativa ssp. japonica and o. sativa ssp. indica  <cit> . these authors concluded that this region could be affected by concerted evolution.

previous studies on the evolution of large-scale gene duplication were based on the available genome sequences from widely-divergent species and little is known about the short-term evolution of duplicated copies and their role in species divergence within a genus. the model species oryza sativa l. and its wild relatives represent an ideal system to answer questions about gene and genome evolution  <cit> . genomic data and the well-characterized phylogeny available for this genus enable a comparative approach of the evolutionary history of this duplication between several closely-related species.

adopting a phylogenetic approach, we isolated and sequenced orthologous duplicated pairs from the region of interest in a set of  <dig> representative oryza genomes, including tetraploid o. minuta and the surrogate parental species o. punctata and o. officinalis, as well as in the closely-related species leersia perrieri and potamophila parviflora. we demonstrate the presence and strong conservation of the duplication both within the genus and in close outgroup species. its presence in the more distant species brachypodium distachyon and sorghum bicolor  <cit>  suggests that its origin is concomitant with the cereal ancestral genome duplication and that the specific mechanisms that have led to the high levels of sequence conservation within this region of the oryza genomes are probably recurrent.

RESULTS
sequence conservation in subtelomeric regions of chromosomes  <dig> and 12
the duplicated subtelomeric regions of oryza sativa ssp. japonica chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have been described as being highly conserved  <cit> . additional file  <dig> shows a dot plot between the first  <dig>  mbp of these chromosomes. sequence conservation is particularly high within the first  <dig> mbp. beyond this point, large-scale conservation is no longer detectable, similarity being limited to individual genes or blocks of genes, which are visible on the zoom of this region. the loss of colinearity is due to sequence divergence and the movement of transposable elements since the duplication event.

phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic trees based on duplicated sequences can have two topologies, depending on the relative dates of the duplication and speciation events. if duplication predates speciation, we expect to find one copy of each gene pair from all species in one branch of the tree and the other copies in a second branch. in contrast, if the duplication follows speciation we expect to find the paralogous gene pairs as terminal nodes. if the duplication between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> occurred within the oryza genus, we would expect to find two gene copies for post-duplication species, with a "speciation after duplication" topology, and only one for species having diverged before the duplication. using primer pairs selected as described in methods, we amplified and sequenced gene fragments from seven oryza species and the closely-related leersia perrieri and potamophila parviflora , corresponding to nine genes  selected along the duplicated region . among these, five  were retained for genus-wide analysis according to the following criteria: minimum length of  <dig> bp, amplification of both exonic and intronic sequences to clone the more variable intronic regions and their distribution on the duplicated fragment. the four remaining sequences  were amplified on a reduced set of species . putative functions were verified by blastx alignment against viridiplantae proteins.

the genes in bold were amplified on the complete sample set whereas the others were amplified on the more distant species only. cds size is given for the multiple alignement of codons sequences.

figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show phylogenetic trees constructed using the maximum likelihood  method, and bootstrap values for both ml and maximum parsimony  analysis. trees were rooted with homologous copies identified in either sorghum bicolor  <cit>  or brachypodium distachyon http://www.brachypodium.org genomes, but the branches leading to these outgroup are not proportional to their divergence. two copies of each sequence were isolated almost systematically in all species including l. perrieri and p. parviflora. the fact that two separate copies were isolated for all genes in leersia is not surprising considering its position in our trees, where all copies of all amplified sequences from this species are grouped in the same clade as the oryza species.

for sequences a, c, f and g all paralogous copies group together, showing a "duplication after speciation" topology, except for the two gene c copies of o. granulata , c , f  and g ). for sequences f and g, only one copy from p. parviflora and o. granulata, respectively, were isolated. bootstrap values are not strong for internal nodes, certainly because of the weak phylogenetic signal for these sequences , but terminal nodes grouping the paralogous copies are strongly supported.

the genes in bold were amplified on the complete sample set whereas the others were amplified on the more distant species only. mean ds, mean dn and mean k are the average synonymous, non-synonymous and non-coding substitutions rates values for all the pairwise comparisons in one data set.

for sequences b and d , two copies were isolated for all species, and all paralogous pairs are grouped together, except for o. officinalis gene b copy  <dig> which diverged earlier. their strong conservation rate is reflected by the weak support for internal nodes, particularly for sequence b. for sequence d, we isolated only one copy from o. australiensis but, given the number of clones sampled , the second copy has probably been deleted or is too divergent to be amplified. moreover, this single copy is sister to one of the tetraploid o. minuta copies, which was not expected. overall, sequences b and d clearly show a "duplication after speciation" topology type.

on the other hand, sequences e and i display a "duplication before speciation" topology . only one copy of gene e was isolated for o. brachyantha and o. granulata, but for all other species the two copies are separated. one copy forms a monophyletic clade with the nipponbare chromosome  <dig> sequence, while the second and third copies of o. punctata and o. minuta are grouped with the nipponbare paralog on chromosome  <dig>  the second copies from o. officinalis, o. australiensis, l. perrieri and p. parviflora, as well as the single copies from o. brachyantha and o. granulata, are grouped in a second, large clade, being more divergent from the copy  <dig> in these more ancient species. this is in agreement with the hypothesis of an independent divergence of the two paralogous sequences after duplication, the o. brachyantha and o. granulata single copies belonging to the "chromosome 12" clade.

in the ml tree of gene i we clearly observe separation between paralogs from o. brachyantha, o. australiensis, o. officinalis, o. punctata, o. minuta and nipponbare, each paralogous set for these species forming a monophyletic group. however, neither the ml nor the mp trees allow clarification of the relationships between the copies of the older species, p. parviflora, l. perrieri and o. granulata. this analysis is complicated by the fact that we isolated only one paralog for p. parviflora and o. granulata. we observed a  <dig> bp repeat element insertion, accompanying a deletion in copy  <dig> of o. brachyantha, but no topology change was observed when excluding this large indel event before analysis. this repeat sequence belongs to the mite castaway-like family .

for gene h, we obtained peculiar results . the first obvious observation is the number and position of copies of the outgroup l. perrieri. we get at least  <dig> different copies, listed  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively sister to o. punctata  <dig>  o. minuta  <dig>  o. punctata  <dig>  and the clade regrouping o. officinalis and o. minuta  <dig>  this result was checked by three independent cycles of cloning-sequencing, with two different l. perrieri dna extracts. only one copy was isolated for the most distant species p. parviflora, o. brachyantha and o. granulata, as well as for o. officinalis, and the two copies of o. australiensis are separated. however, both copies of o. punctata , o. minuta, and nipponbare were closely related. as a result we have a mixed topology, with paralogous sequences evolving independently in the older species.

paralogous pair divergence
to investigate potential bias in paralog divergence, we first compared the sequence data sets . the number of parsimony informative sites and indel events are given for information. the mean rates of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitutions are the means for all sequence comparisons in each data set. mean ds varies from  <dig>  for sequence b to  <dig>  for sequence f, mean dn varies from  <dig>  for sequences c and h to  <dig>  for sequence e, and mean k varies from  <dig>  for sequence b to  <dig>  for sequence f. there seems to be no correlation between the two kinds of observed topologies and the global divergence values of the data set, indicating that these genes are evolving at equivalent rates, whatever the proportion of within-species concerted evolution.

we show divergence values between each paralogous pair in additional file  <dig>  it would have been interesting to compute combined data set analysis, at least for a complete sampling matrix, in order to increase information support, but this was not possible as the paralogous pairs were not isolated for all species. we were particularly interested in the ds values, to examine global neutral evolution of our duplicated pairs, and the dn/ds ratio, to verify the neutrality hypothesis and detect signatures of positive selection. mean ds values for paralogous pairs for each species ranged from  <dig>  for o. granulata to  <dig>  for o. australiensis, but there is a bias due to missing paralogs in some data sets. paralogous ds rates were not significantly different  between each species. mean ds values for each gene ranged from  <dig>  for gene g to  <dig>  for gene e. ds rates were significatively higher for gene e, compared with genes b , d  and g  at the  <dig> % level. we observed the same difference between gene i and genes b , d  and g . these results are in agreement with the corresponding observed topologies. mean dn/ds ratios for each paralogous pair ranged from  <dig>  for o. brachyantha to  <dig>  for o. punctata. positive selection was tested between each pair in all genes with a z-test of selection. benjamini&hochberg-corrected estimates of p-values were significant at the  <dig>  probability level for three paralogous pairs: o. sativa ssp. japonica copies of gene b , l. perrieri copies of genes b  and d  and p. parviflora copies of gene g .

the k ratio, the rate of nucleotide substitution calculated for orthologous non-coding sequences, is expected to be higher than the dn value and approximately equal to the ds rate, as non-coding sequences are also considered to evolve without selective pressure. however, if mechanisms leading to homogenization of paralogous pairs between both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> operate indiscriminately on both coding and non-coding sequences, we would expect that the intron sequences diverge more slowly between paralogs than between inter-species orthologs. if these mechanisms apply only to coding sequences, dn and ds rates between paralogs should be lower than k values, the latter showing no difference in paralogous and orthologous comparisons. mean k values between paralogs for each gene vary from  <dig>  for gene b to  <dig>  for gene i, and seem to be correlated with the different topologies observed. we compared these data with divergence among the orthologs for each sequence. k substitutions were lower for paralogs than for orthologs for genes b , d , h  and i . the mean k value for all pairwise paralog comparisons was approximately  <dig>  and was significantly lower than the mean k  for all ortholog comparisons . for comparison, k values calculated for adh orthologs  varied from  <dig>   to  <dig>   with a mean of  <dig> . we compared k, ds and dn mean ratios between paralogs, except for genes e and i, which present a topology of "duplication before speciation" type. mean k was not significantly different from mean ds  and mean dn  at the  <dig>  significance level. these data are more in favor of a homogenized concerted evolution mechanism along the whole genes and confirm results from wang et al.  <cit> , who described whole-gene conversion for two paralogous pairs of this duplication 11- <dig> in o. sativa ssp. japonica subspecies.

evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes in o. minuta
in polyploid species, the evolution rates between duplicated copies are expected to change, either by accumulation of deleterious mutations in one of the redundant copies, leading to pseudogenization, or accumulation of positive mutations leading to neofunctionalization, or possibly subfunctionalization. four copies for each sequence in the 11- <dig> duplication should be present in the tetraploid species o. minuta, two from the b genome and two from the c genome  <cit> , except if gene loss has occurred early in the diploidization process. thus, genes are three times redundant and we assessed whether this redundancy can influence their evolution. we tested to see  if we could detect accumulation of mutations and positive selection due to relaxed selection constraint or  if concerted evolution also homogenized all the homeologous copies. we isolated  <dig> copies for genes d, e and h and  <dig> for genes b and i. the divergence rates of the tetraploid copies were estimated by concatenating  <dig> sequences b, d, e, h, i for o. punctata  <dig>  o. punctata  <dig>  and o. officinalis  <dig>  , and o. minuta  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> . this yielded a total data matrix of  <dig> bp, including  <dig> bp in exons. we calculated the dn, ds and k ratios  between each o. minuta copy and its orthologs in the diploid genomes, between the paralogous and paleologous copies themselves and, finally, between the surrogate diploid progenitors.

synonymous , non-synonymous  and intronic  substitution rates are indicated between the allotetraploid o. minuta combined copies , and their putative orthologs in diploid progenitors , between the homeologous copies in o. minuta, and between the diploid parental orthologous copies. number of synonymous  and non-synonymous substitutions  are indicated for the tetraploid and its parental genomes, with nipponbare as outgroup.

divergence  between o. punctata and o. officinalis copies on the one hand and o. punctata paralogs on the other are very similar, which could be explained by the close relationships between the two putative progenitors. ds values between these two species in the monoculm <dig> region were also low  <cit> . ds and dn ratios between o. minuta copies  <dig> and  <dig>  were slightly lower than between copies  <dig> and  <dig> and copies  <dig> and  <dig>  we postulate that if there was divergence of o. minuta copies from the parental copies, following by concerted evolution between the allotetraploid copies, the divergences observed now between o. minuta1/o. minuta <dig> and o. minuta1/o. minuta <dig> should be lower than between o. punctata1/o. minuta <dig>  o. punctata2/o. minuta <dig> and o. officinalis/o. minuta <dig>  copies of the tetraploid and their respective diploid orthologs displayed very low substitution rates, in particular for o. punctata and o. minuta. this is more in favor of maintenance and parsimonious divergence of all the copies after the hybridization/polyploidization event than a concerted evolution of these copies. concerning the dn/ds ratio, positive selection was only detected between o. punctata  <dig> and o. minuta  <dig> copies . the o. punctata 2-o. minuta  <dig> pair presents a high dn/ds , but the test was not significant .

to compare with the data of lu et al.  <cit> , we calculated the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in the tetraploid and its parental genomes, with nipponbare  as outgroup . lu et al. showed that both non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions were in excess in o. minuta. four of the  <dig> genes they tested had dn/ds > <dig> between o. minuta and the diploid progenitors, revealing relaxed pressure of selection in the tetraploid. the similar number of substitutions in the diploids and the tetraploids and detection of positive selection for only one of the allotetraploid copies in the duplicated 11- <dig> fragment are in favor of concerted evolutionary dynamics.

analysis of the duplicated region in sorghum and brachypodium
the amplification of two copies for most genes we selected in the 11- <dig> region, not only for species from the oryza genus, but also from the related leersia perrieri and potamophila parviflora, was concordant with the recent results of paterson et al.  <cit> . these authors detected a duplicated segment, also showing strong conservation, in the corresponding regions of sorghum bicolor chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and suggested that the duplication event occurred before the cereal divergence. we used the artemis comparison tool  to compare the 11- <dig> region with the sorghum chromosome sequences and look for evidence of conservation of the duplicated region in the new grass model species, brachypodium distachyon http://www.brachypodium.org. blast analysis indeed showed strong similarity between the  <dig> mbp region on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and a  <dig> mbp region on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of sorghum. surprisingly, there is a clear inversion of ~ <dig>  mbp only on sorghum chromosome  <dig> between  <dig> and  <dig>  mbp which corresponds to  <dig>  to  <dig> mbp on rice chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . sequence comparison with the current assembly of the 4× coverage of the brachypodium distachyon genome identified only one contig, super-contig  <dig> . however, closer inspection showed that these hits corresponded to two different regions of this contig, the first  <dig> mbp and the last  <dig>  mbp. act visualization of sequence conservation shows that the duplicated region at the end of the contig  is inverted compared with the sequences of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> .

discussion
the rice genus underwent two episodes of rapid diversification  <cit>  and thus rapid speciation which, with the fact that the 11- <dig> subtelomeric region is highly conserved, explains the poorly resolved internal node in some of our trees. this leads to unclear phylogenetic relationships between oryza species and the outgroup leersia perrieri, in contrast to the observations of guo and ge  <cit> . moreover, leersia presents similar characteristics to o. brachyantha, which is on the boundary of the genus  <cit> . we identified more than two copies of the h sequence for l. perrieri, each sister to one oryza species copy. l. perrieri was identified as a diploid species   <cit> , and we have obtained independent confirmation . two copies of adh <dig> and gpa <dig> were also isolated in this species  <cit> , both of "leersia" type. these genes and gene h may have been duplicated since the divergence of leersia from the other oryza branches but more sequence information from this species is necessary to draw precise conclusions. while we cannot exclude mechanisms of "birth and death" in the generation of new gene copies elsewhere in the wild species' genomes, our approach, including amplification on mapped bac clones in all oryza species, strongly suggests that the gene copies are effectively on the orthologous regions of these genomes.

isolation of paralogous pairs in seven oryza species and two outgroups confirmed, firstly, that the duplication is not specific to the genus and, secondly, that the gene sequences are highly conserved between species. wang et al.  <cit>  described a high level of concerted evolution in this duplication in the two oryza sativa subspecies, japonica and indica, which they dated to 5-7mya, but showed that this conservation was heterogeneous along the segment. similarly, our analysis shows different phylogenetic topologies throughout the duplication in the oryza genus. all species display the same evolutionary mechanisms for the first sequences on the duplication, with a "duplication after speciation" topology. while we cannot formally exclude independent duplication in all species, widespread concerted evolution is the most parsimonious explanation. paralogous pair divergence is similar, showing high conservation of the sequences. even the allotetraploid species, oryza minuta, shows no evidence of relaxed selective pressure, despite the putative presence of four copies of each gene. this conservation throughout the genus and in related species suggests that concerted evolution in this subtelomeric region is a recurrent process. moreover our analysis of the k ratio between paralogous and orthologous copies indicated that the concerted mechanism involved would occur on the whole genes, and not only on the coding sequences.

recently, paterson et al.  <cit>  described a duplicated segment in the corresponding regions of the sorghum genome and suggested that the apparent segmental duplication in oryza sativa resulted from the older pan-cereal duplication. these observations and our results indicate that we are no longer looking at the short-term evolution of recently-duplicated genes, as has been suggested  <cit> , and that previous dating based on molecular clock calculations were biased by the weak divergence rate. however, these authors describe a much larger conserved, duplicated region in rice and the exact extent and degree of conservation remain to be determined. our results rather suggest that recurrent gene conversion is probably limited to a relatively short region, with much higher conservation in the immediate sub-telomeric region and a gradient of sequence divergence. this may explain the relatively high divergence times  calculated by paterson et al.  <cit> 

in this context, a similar duplication in the brachypodium distachyon genome is expected. indeed, oryza and brachypodium both belong to the bep  clade, whereas sorghum belongs to the pacc  clade  <cit> . these clades diverged between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> , soon after the divergence of the grasses. we identified two regions orthologous to the 11- <dig> duplication on the first brachypodium genome release, confirming its presence in this species, although future assemblies using deeper coverage will be needed to confirm the chromosome locations.

gene conversion and unequal crossing-over events are the mechanisms proposed to explain such a level of conservation after tens of millions of years, but more in-depth genomic and cytological work would help to determine the type and frequency of these events. an inversion event, which constitutes a major chromosomal locus rearrangement, was detected on sorghum chromosome  <dig> and potentially in one of the brachypodium  duplicated regions. inversions can be a source of genomic novelties as well as sequence divergence  <cit>  and such an event in a region which has undergone concerted evolution suggests that it is probably recent.

in the more proximal region of the duplication , gene pairs appear to be less influenced by concerted evolution as we observed "duplication before speciation" topologies and isolated single copies for ancient species. moreover the neutral ds rate was stronger for these genes. this could be explained either by divergence of one of the sequences, making amplification of both copies with primers designed on oryza sativa impossible, or loss of one copy, as for the majority of duplicated genes in rice through the diploidization process  <cit> . a clear rupture in highly-conserved colinearity can be observed in the dot plot of the 11- <dig> region in oryza sativa . wang et al.  <cit>  proposed a first model of the distribution and order of crossing over events throughout the duplication explaining the heterogeneity in sequence similarity between japonica paralogs. we will be able to extend this model to wild species with finer genome analysis, but our results on gene h  already suggest recent conversion events specific to two species .

genetic recombination is influenced by chromosomal location  <cit> . the subtelomeric location of the 11- <dig> duplication could be one factor explaining its evolution. however, the subtelomeres of rice have rather been described as dynamic regions where duplications have spawned new copies of genes  <cit> . in agreement with our observations, wang et al.  <cit>  recently described gene conversion occurring at a higher frequency towards the terminal regions of rice and sorghum chromosomes, showing wholly converted genes at an average distance of  <dig> mbp from the telomeres in rice and a similar tendency in homologous regions of sorghum. however, these calculations are biased by the over-representation of two duplicated regions, between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and the 11- <dig> duplication, which represent between them 82% of wholly converted genes and, to a lesser extent, high levels of conversion in the orthologous regions in sorghum. rather than being a genome-wide phenomenon, these observations suggest that as-yet unknown selective pressures have contributed to the maintenance of high sequence identity within these two specific regions, and particularly the 11- <dig> duplication.

our results suggest the presence of two duplicated chromosomal fragments, currently found on all oryza chromosomes  <dig> &  <dig>  sorghum chromosomes  <dig> &  <dig>  and brachypodium contig  <dig>  which have been homogenized through concerted evolution since the ancestral wgd, dated after the eudicot-monocot divergence . wang et al.  <cit>  proposed a stochastic evolution of gene pairs, in which conversion acts as an occasional, sometimes frequent interruption to independent evolution of paralogs. our observations on genes in the subtelomeric 11- <dig> region throughout the oryza genus and in related species, suggesting continuous concerted evolution affecting the same gene pairs in widely-divergent species, are not in agreement with this hypothesis. as suggested above, they rather indicate mechanisms acting preferentially in specific duplicated regions, and most notably in the duplication between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
our observations suggest recurrent but heterogeneous concerted evolution has led to the extremely high sequence conservation occurring in this region of more than  <dig> mbp. the detection of paralogous copies for almost all genes in all the species studied indicates a specific mechanism which has led to conservation in this duplicated region throughout the oryza genus and in related species. it will be interesting to compare detailed structure of both distal ends of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> with other rice genomic regions . more detailed comparative analysis will allow a clearer understanding of the selection or structural pressure which tends to conserve this particular region.
