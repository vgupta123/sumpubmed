BACKGROUND
in yeast cells as in animal cells, cytokinesis requires the formation of an actomyosin contractile ring  <cit> . saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses a single myo <dig> gene, which encodes the myosin ii heavy chain protein , the only conventional myosin ii of the budding yeast. myo1p is associated with f-actin during formation of the contractile apparatus, and provides the actin-activated atpase activity driving the contraction of the actomyosin ring at cytokinesis  <cit> . previous studies have described the importance of myo1p in cytokinesis in yeast by establishing that myosin ii concentrates at the bud neck, contracts during the cytokinesis, and subsequently is redistributed or degraded after the completion of mitosis  <cit> .

in addition to the loss of normal cytokinesis function, myo1Δ strains present phenotypes such as the formation of attached cells, loss of axial budding pattern, cell enlargement, osmotic hypersensitivity, delocalized chitin deposition  <cit> , increased chitin synthesis <cit> , and hypersensitivity to nikkomycin z  <cit> . the diversity of these phenotypes, many of which can be associated with cell wall organization, suggests that myosin ii may affect cellular functions other than cytokinesis. the purpose of this study was to generate a global mrna expression profile of myo1Δ strains using yeast oligonucleotide microarrays to identify potential relationships between the multiple myo1Δ phenotypes mentioned and changes in the transcription profile of specific genes that can be functionally related to these phenotypes.

RESULTS
the results of independent microarray hybridization experiments conducted with two different myo1Δ knockout strains were averaged and combined for comparison with the corresponding wild-type control values. our rationale for this experimental design was to identify deferentially regulated genes held in common between at least two different myo1Δ strain backgrounds in order to eliminate any strain specific differences and preserve strictly myo1Δ-dependent genetic phenotypes. cells were cultured in histidine dropout medium or csm to maintain the culture conditions under which myo1Δ strains have been shown to require chitin synthase iii expression for their survival  <cit>  as well as to maintain equivalent growth conditions between mutant and wild-type strains, respectively.

up regulated genes in myo1Δ
previously published studies reported differentially expressed genes under conditions such as cell wall mutations, chemical and biochemical perturbations of the cell wall  <cit> , diverse mutations covering 4% of the yeast genome  <cit> , and during the cell cycle  <cit> , employing values with p ≤  <dig> . we identified  <dig> genes in common with these previous studies out of a total of  <dig>  genes with p ≤  <dig>  that were differentially expressed in myo1Δ strains .

to refine this analysis we used a more stringent cutoff  to identify  <dig> differentially expressed genes in myo1Δ strains. we observed a total of  <dig> up regulated genes in myo1Δ strains compared to the wild type control strains. the functional categories of the up regulated genes that were represented as listed in the saccharomyces genome database  were: cell organization and biogenesis , metabolism , transport , carbohydrate metabolism , stress response , protein biosynthesis , cell cycle , signal transduction , transcription , sporulation , budding , rna processing , protein transport , protein amino acid phosphorylation , protein amino acid dephosphorylation , autophagy , dna repair , cell growth and maintenance , and unknown functions  .

the results of this dna microarrays analysis were validated by real time rt-pcr using a subset of these up regulated genes. the real time rt-pcr results indicated a fold change of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for slt <dig>  ecm <dig>  spi <dig>  yhr097c, rom <dig> and ira <dig> respectively that were consistent with the microarray results .

down regulated genes in myo1Δ
a total of  <dig> genes were down regulated in the myo1Δ strains. as was expected for the knockout mutation, the myo <dig> gene was identified among the down regulated genes in myo1Δ strains . represented functional categories established by the sgd were: cell organization and biogenesis , transport , protein biosynthesis , metabolism , dna metabolism , carbohydrate metabolism , stress response , cell cycle , signal transduction , transcription , sporulation , budding , cell growth and maintenance , protein transport , dna damage response , rna localization , protein amino acid phosphorylation , rna processing , and genes of unknown function  . real time rt-pcr results for rpl <dig> and rps <dig> indicated negative fold changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively that were consistent with the microarray results .

gene set enrichment analysis
in order to identify functionally related gene sets that were differentially expressed and behaved in a coordinated fashion in the myo1Δ strains, a gene set enrichment analysis   <cit>  was performed. this kind of analysis is useful for whole genome expression assays, because it allows the visualization of the data in groups and how these groups are represented in the microarray. for this analysis a gene set was created for all the  <dig>  genes contained in the array, considering the t-value for each gene, and then calculating the mean of the t-values for each category. the genes were classified in categories by biological function according to the saccharomyces genome database   <cit> . the gsea analysis was performed using the limma package from bioconductor  <cit>  as described in the materials and methods section. of the  <dig> categories considered for gsea, there were five categories with a corrected p-value below the cutoff . these categories were: protein biosynthesis, stress response, rna processing, carbohydrate metabolism and genes of unknown function. histograms of density versus t-value were generated for each category to observe the distribution of genes of a specific category compared with the normal distribution of all the categories on the arrays . plots of t-values vs. a-values were created to identify the genes in each category and observe their distribution across the array . of the five gene categories selected, the protein biosynthesis and stress response categories presented the most dramatic changes in their normal distribution. although the other three categories had p-values below the cutoff, when we observe their respective histograms there were less dramatic differences in the distribution of each group compared to the whole microarray. the protein biosynthesis category is interesting because the histogram shows a shift from the normal distribution towards negative t-values . this is also observed in the corresponding t-value vs. a-value plot where we can see a greater quantity of genes biased towards negative t-values . this result was predictable due to the great quantity of genes related to protein biosynthesis that were down regulated in the microarray. within the protein biosynthesis gene category there were an unusually high number of ribosomal protein genes that were down regulated suggesting that ribosome biogenesis may be affected in the myo1Δ strains. this interpretation would be consistent with the relatively slow growth rate reported for these cells compared to their wild-type controls  <cit> . conversely, in the histogram for stress response genes, there was a shift from the normal distribution of the array towards positive t-values . this shift can be explained by the up-regulation of stress response genes with high t-values, therefore causing this type of shift to the right of the normal distribution curve. considering the t-value vs. a-value plot, the stress response genes were distributed above zero towards positives t-values. among these stress response genes were gre <dig> and gre <dig> that are regulated by the high osmolarity glycerol response-signaling pathway   <cit> . another stress response gene that had the highest t-value was hor <dig>  this gene encodes a putative gpi anchored cell wall protein of unknown function that was also previously reported to be related to high osmolarity response  <cit> . differential expression of these genes indicates that genes in this pathway may become activated in myo1Δ strains despite the absence of hyperosmotic conditions in our experimental design. however, a hog1Δ deletion was viable in these myo1Δ strains indicating that this pathway is not essential for myo1Δ cell viability under our culture conditions .

although the "unknown function" category had a greater representation of differentially expressed genes in the array, there was no shift in the density vs. t-values histogram  or the t-values vs. a-values plot . due to the fact that this category also has more genes represented in the yeast genome, this group was not considered of interest for this analysis. however, we are aware that this category represents the majority population of differentially expressed genes many of which exhibit extraordinary fold-changes in the double-digit range. these could represent a pool of genes with potentially novel functions related to cell proliferation, cell division, and cell wall organization.

carbohydrate metabolism was another functional category exhibiting a large number of genes with dramatic ranges in mrna expression levels. the gsea results for this category showed a bimodal distribution . however, in the t-value vs. a-value plot these genes were distributed throughout the array with no apparent bias towards negative or positive t-values . this bimodal distribution may be significant as it may represent the existence of two sub-populations of genes with distinct behaviors.

differential regulation of pkc1p/slt2p cell integrity pathway
the slt2/mpk1gene that encodes a serine/threonine map kinase involved in regulating the maintenance of cell integrity  <cit>  was up regulated approximately 2-fold in the myo1Δ strains . in other studies it was reported that phospho-slt2p was also activated in the myo1Δ mutant compared to the wild type strain  <cit> . a previous study defined a cluster of  <dig> genes regulated by this pkc1-mediated signaling pathway that were strongly induced by chemical perturbation of the cell wall with congo red dye, by enzymatic treatment with zymolyase, or by mutations in specific cell wall genes such as kre <dig>  gas <dig>  fks <dig>  mnn <dig> and knr <dig>  <cit> . sed <dig>  hsp <dig>  slt <dig>  fbp <dig> and yhr097c  represent five of these  <dig> genes that were also up regulated in the myo1Δ strains  further supporting that the pkc <dig> signaling pathway is activated. a myo1Δslt2Δ strain expressing the myo <dig> gene on a prs <dig> plasmid was grown at 26°c in 5-foa to extract the plasmid and generate the myo1Δslt2Δ double knockout. after three days, no growth was observed for the myo1Δslt2Δ double knockout . this result corroborates that slt2Δ is synthetically lethal in a myo1Δ mutant and supports that the cell integrity pathway is essential for viability in these strains  <cit> .

suppression of nikkomycin z hypersensitivity by overexpression of ribosomal protein genes
gene set enrichment analysis showed that protein biosynthesis genes were coordinately down regulated in these myo1Δ strains . rpl <dig> and rps <dig> ribosomal protein genes were among those differentially expressed in the myo1Δ microarrays. the rpl <dig> gene is essential in budding yeast  <cit>  and its protein product is a component of the large ribosomal  subunit. the rps <dig> gene product constitutes a fusion of a non-essential small ribosomal  subunit protein with ubiquitin, which facilitates the assembly of ribosomal proteins into ribosomes and is required for the proper translation of gcn <dig>  a transcription factor that regulates amino acid biosynthesis  <cit> . a previous screen for suppressors of nikkomycin z  hypersensitivity in myo1Δ strains identified the cdnas encoding rpl <dig> and rps <dig> among others  <cit> . nikkomycin z is a competitive inhibitor of chs3p and our previous studies established the hypersensitivity of myo1Δ strains to this antibiotic which inhibits cell growth and affects cell integrity by blocking chitin synthesis  <cit> . recombinant rpl <dig> and rps <dig> conferred 67% and 69% resistance to nikkomycin z respectively, when overexpressed by induction with 2% galactose . we confirmed increased transcription of both ribosomal protein cdnas in a wild-type strain by real time rt-pcr . these results support that overexpression of ribosomal protein genes may suppresses nz hypersensitivity in myo1Δ strains by contributing to restore cell integrity. though the mechanism is unclear, other rp genes identified in our previous study had a similar effect.

western blot analysis of the level of phosphorylated slt2p in myo1Δ strains overexpressing rpl <dig> or rps31
to relate suppression of nz hypersensitivity with the restoration of cell integrity in myo1Δ strains, we assayed the level of phosphorylated slt2p  by western blot. it has been previously established that the cell integrity pathway is activated in myo1Δ mutants  <cit> . our results show increases in p-slt2p levels for myo1Δ strains overexpressing rpl <dig>  and rps <dig>  . moreover, we also detected increases in p-slt2p levels for wild type strains overexpressing rpl <dig>  and rps <dig>  genes in repressing and inducing conditions . the former observation can be explained by leakage from the gal <dig> promoter under repressing conditions  and suggested that the activation of the cell integrity pathway can respond to very minor changes in rp gene transcription. when slt <dig> mrna levels were measured, the fold changes for strains wild type prs316-rpl <dig>  wild type prs316-rps <dig>  myo1Δprs316-rpl <dig>  and myo1Δprs316-rps <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . while both rp cdnas had similar effects on p-slt2p levels, fold changes in slt <dig> mrna levels induced by rp overexpression were consistently lower for rpl <dig> than for rps <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
following our analysis of the global mrna expression profile in myo1Δ strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae we found that there were  <dig> differentially regulated genes. gene set enrichment analysis indicated that stress response and protein biosynthesis gene categories are inversely related in this mutant. these results support that cell wall morphogenetic processes were affected by myosin ii deficiency. the up-regulation of stress response genes in the myo1Δ strains reflects the essentiality of the cell integrity pathway and the importance of the pkc1-mediated signaling pathway for survival in these strains. the coordinated down-regulation of protein biosynthesis genes can be related to a loss of cell wall integrity in this mutant because overexpression of rpl <dig> and rps <dig>  two differentially regulated ribosomal protein  genes, conferred nikkomycin z resistance to the hypersensitive myo1Δ strains. overexpression of rpl <dig> and rps <dig> did not shut down the cell integrity pathway supporting that their overexpression promotes activation of the pkc <dig> pathway.

the high frequency of ribosomal protein genes in the down regulated gene category implies that ribosome biogenesis is greatly affected by myosin type ii deficiency. it has been proposed that yeast cells regulate ribosome biogenesis primarily by responding to growth limiting environmental signals  <cit> . cell wall and plasma membrane stress may therefore represent such signals that can activate signaling pathways for regulating growth rate in the absence of myosin ii. we propose that this alteration in the normal regulation of these processes may be necessary for the completion of cytokinesis in the absence of a contractile ring that must involve increased chitin synthesis and extensive cell wall remodeling at the bud neck.

we previously demonstrated that overexpression of the cdna for ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc <dig> lowered the p-slt2p levels and conferred resistance to nz in myo1Δ strains, suggesting that cell integrity was restored  <cit> . we have now discovered that overexpression of rpl <dig> and rps <dig> can also up regulate the cell integrity pathway to achieve a similar effect. it is unclear how such an alteration in the level of transcription of individual rp genes can affect this pathway but it is known that ribosome biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process in yeast that can be affected by altering the stoichiometry of the individual ribosomal subunits  <cit> . this observation could therefore represent an effect of up regulation of ribosome biosynthesis on cell integrity. alternatively, the response of the pkc <dig> pathway to changes in rp gene transcription may represent one aspect of a novel feedback regulatory loop. others have reported that inhibition of the tor pathway by rapamycin treatment activated the pkc <dig> cell integrity pathway in yeast cells  <cit> . it was acknowledged that inhibition of the tor pathway also results in repression of the ribosomal biogenesis process  <cit> . the similarity of the described phenotypes with those of myo1Δ strains merits further investigation to determine if down regulation of the tor pathway is a contributing factor to the phenotypes in these strains.
