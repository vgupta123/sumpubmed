BACKGROUND
nonself recognition systems are ubiquitous in diverse organisms as exemplified by restriction endonucleases in bacteria  <cit>  and the major histocompatibility complex in vertebrates  <cit> . in filamentous fungi, such as neurospora crassa, nonself recognition occurs in both the sexual and vegetative phases  <cit> . in the sexual phase, nonself recognition is associated with the mating-type locus and facilitates outbreeding  <cit> . during the vegetative phase, nonself recognition may occur after cells fuse to form heterokaryotic cells, which contain two or more genetically distinct nuclei  <cit> . in n. crassa, viability of heterokaryons is governed by heterokaryon incompatibility  loci  <cit>  where an allelic difference at one or more of these loci results in programmed cell death  <cit> .

as in other filamentous ascomycetes, n. crassa has multiple het loci. one of these, the un- <dig> gene, has an interesting dual function. in addition to heterokaryon incompatibility, un- <dig> also encodes the large subunit of a class i ribonucleotide reductase . class i rnrs are highly conserved across eukaryotes and operate as tetramers composed of two large subunits and two small subunits that catalyze the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates  into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates . the dndps are, in turn, phosphorylated to obtain the dntps that are essential for de novo synthesis of dna  <cit> . this dual function of un- <dig> is of particular interest since it implicates a potential connection between dna synthesis and nonself recognition-associated cell death.

there have been no reports of nonself recognition function by rnrs in organisms outside of neurospora, suggesting that this is a derived characteristic of the un- <dig> gene. overall, the predicted un- <dig> protein is very similar to other eukaryotic rnr class i large subunits except for a well defined, variable region near the c-terminus  <cit> . interestingly, the carboxy termini of the two allelic forms of un- <dig> in n. crassa, oakridge  and panama , are strikingly different and bear signatures of diversifying selection  <cit> . this led us to test whether incompatibility function of un- <dig> proteins reside in the c-terminus region, and indeed this is the case; the c-termini of both allelic forms can autonomously trigger an incompatibility reaction when expressed in cells having the opposite allele. we then sought to determine if the un- <dig> c-termini from n. crassa retained activity when expressed in the unicellular yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. surprisingly, the  <dig> amino acid pa incompatibility domain  is also toxic when expressed in yeast. given that yeast appears to lack a vegetative nonself recognition system  <cit> , this trans-species incompatibility activity provided an opportunity to explore the mechanism of this nonself recognition domain without interference from other incompatibility factors normally present in n. crassa.

RESULTS
incompatibility activity and specificity of the un- <dig> c-terminus
the or and pa un- <dig> proteins exhibit significant differences in their ~ <dig> amino acid  c-termini  <cit>  whereas the ~ <dig> aa n-terminal regions are identical. we hypothesized that incompatibility specificity would reside in the c-terminal portion of un- <dig>  we tested this using constructs consisting of a hygromycin b resistance gene, hph, fused in-frame to various fragments of un-24pa or un-24or . we could infer expression of the fused un- <dig> domains by virtue of hygromycin b resistance of the transformants. incompatibility activity of these constructs was tested by transforming them into c9- <dig>  and c2- <dig>  strains and examining transformant viability and/or phenotype . in our naming scheme the range of un- <dig> amino acid residues included in the fusion gene product is given in parentheses. for example, the hygunpa construct that contained the un-24pa region from residue  <dig> to the c-terminus  conferred pa-like incompatibility  when transformed into c9- <dig>  . omission of six amino acids from the c-terminus  resulted in loss of incompatibility activity. therefore, both specificity and incompatibility activity of un-24pa is encompassed in a  <dig> amino acid domain that corresponds to the flexible c-terminus arm of the large subunit contained within the rnr large subunit found in yeast  <cit> .

compared with un-24pa, a larger region of un-24or is required for incompatibility activity . the construct hygunor did not carry incompatibility when transformed into c2- <dig> . however hygunor caused or-like incompatibility , albeit to a lesser degree than the full length un-24or or the full length or protein fused in frame with hph . deletion of  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminus  of the full length un-24or resulted in a loss of incompatibly activity. taken together, these data showed that the c-terminus of both pa and or is required for incompatibility and that activity regions differ for the two allelic forms.

expression of the pa incompatibility domain leads to an incompatibility-like reaction in yeast
in n. crassa it appears that un-24-associated incompatibility is due to a toxic interaction between the or and pa protein forms  <cit> . however, analysis of the system is made difficult in n. crassa due to the presence of the het- <dig> gene, which is tightly linked to and interacts with un- <dig> during incompatibility reactions. given that the amino acid sequence of ribonucleotide reductase is similar in n. crassa and yeast  <cit> , that yeast apparently lacks a homolog to het- <dig>  and that yeast does not have an endogenous vegetative nonself recognition system, we explored whether the un- <dig> incompatibility system could be transferred to yeast to provide further insight into the mechanism of un-24-associated incompatibility in general. we sought to determine if expression of the active un- <dig> c-terminal domains  result in incompatibility-like phenotypes in yeast. we used homologous recombination to replace the gal <dig> coding region with our constructs and thus placed their expression under control of the gal <dig> promoter. low or high level expression of our construct was obtained by growing the cells in medium containing glucose or galactose, respectively  <cit> . four gal <dig> replacement strains were obtained in this way; a “control” strain with hph replacing gal <dig> , a “pa” strain containing the hygunpa incompatibility construct, and two “or” strains containing either the hygunor or hygunor. on yeast-peptone medium containing glucose , yeast that carried only hph exhibited the same hygromycin b mic as the wild-type y <dig> strain . when grown on yeast-peptone medium containing raffinose and galactose , all strains with hph-fused constructs exhibited a ~1000-fold increase in resistance to hygromycin b . these results confirmed that our constructs were properly regulated in yeast. as evident in figure 2a, growth on ypd revealed that low-level expression of the pa construct, but not or , resulted in a significantly increased sensitivity to hygromycin b. this effect of the pa domain on yeast was interesting given its incompatibility function in n. crassa and was explored further.

cytoplasmic granulation is one of the first recognizable cytological signs of heterokaryon incompatibility in filamentous fungi  <cit> . consistent with this, phase contrast micrographs of pa-expressing yeast cells grown in ypd had significantly darker cytoplasmic granules when compared to the control strain . we note that the contents of such granules are not known in yeast, nor are they known in n. crassa <cit> . as incompatibility reactions progress in filamentous fungi, cytoplasmic vacuolization and ruptured vacuoles are observed, which can lead to cytoplasmic acidification  <cit> . we saw a similar phenotype in yeast using neutral red, a ph indicator dye that stains yeast vacuoles red  <cit> , in that a significantly larger proportion of pa-expressing cells stained red throughout the cytoplasm than did control cells when growth was on ypd . overall, this staining pattern of the pa-expressing strain was indistinguishable from that of ypl234cΔ, a mutant yeast strain that lacks the vacuolar atpase v <dig> domain subunit c’ and thus cannot effectively sequester h+ in the vacuole  <cit> . therefore, neutral red staining indicated that, similar to the vatpase mutant strain, vacuolar membrane function is compromised in pa-expressing yeast strains. we also found that pa-expressing yeast grown on ypd had a significantly lower growth rate compared to the control strain , a key characteristic of un- <dig> incompatibility in n. crassa <cit> . interestingly, these aberrant yeast phenotypes were not evident when the pa construct was expressed at high levels on ypraf/gal , nor were they observed when the or constructs were expressed at low- or high-levels , suggesting that or constructs did not confer incompatibility in yeast. in summary, low-level expression of pa in yeast caused three hallmark characteristics of fungal incompatibility: cytoplasmic granulation, perturbation of vacuole integrity, and growth inhibition.

pa-expressing yeast have large cell volumes
an emerging theme in fungal nonself recognition is that incompatibility reactions involve lethal or detrimental protein complex formation between allelic or non-allelic proteins  <cit> . in n. crassa, it is hypothesized that a toxic un-24-het- <dig> complex mediates a strong incompatibility reaction, which often results in cell death  <cit> . in the absence of het- <dig>  it is observed that an interaction between the pa and or forms of un- <dig> leads to a weak incompatibility reaction, characterized by an aberrant morphology and a significantly slower growth rate  <cit> . since it appeared that the pa incompatibility domain was capable of causing an incompatibility-like reaction in yeast, we hypothesized that it might interact, and possibility interfere, with the yeast homolog rnr <dig>  function. one prominent observation in yeast that lack rnr1p, or that contain loss-of-function mutations in rnr1p, is that they have significantly larger cell volumes  <cit> . therefore, it may be expected that the interruption of rnr activity in yeast by the pa protein  would result in an increase in average cell volume. in support of this we initially observed that fewer colonies resulted from streaking a single pa-expressing colony on ypd plates . from cell counts with a haemocytometer, we found that equivalent sized 1 mm colonies of pa-expressing yeast contained significantly fewer cells than did control colonies . we determined that this decrease in the number of cells per colony for the pa-expressing strain was not due to a reduction in viable cells based on evan’s blue vital staining . furthermore, as determined by microscopy, when grown in ypd, pa-expressing yeast had significantly larger cell volumes compared to the control strain and ypl234cΔ, the vatpase mutant strain discussed previously , whereas cell volume distributions for the control strain and ypl234cΔ did not differ. we infer that the increased cell volumes of pa-expressing yeast were independent of cytoplasmic acidification.

the noted changes in cell volume are consistent with the hypothesis that pap interferes with yeast rnr1p function. additional support for this idea came from our observation that pa-expressing yeast had an increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea over the control strain when grown in ypd  but not on ypraf/gal . since hydroxyurea is a potent and specific inhibitor of rnr catalytic activity  <cit> , this increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea provided further indications that low-level expression of pap interferes with rnr1p functions in yeast.

pa-expressing strains contain a non-reducible pap-rnr1p protein complex
immunoblotting methods were used to determine whether pap binds to the yeast rnr1p. previously, it was reported that the oxidation state of yeast rnr1p can be determined by sds-page  <cit> . in yeast, the rnr holoenzyme uses free radical chemistry to generate dndps from the respective ndps. during 2′ hydroxyl group removal from the ribose moiety of the ndp, a disulphide bridge is formed between two cysteine residues in the catalytic site of rnr1p. once the newly formed dndp is released from the catalytic site, the flexible c-terminus of the adjacent r <dig> subunit enters into the catalytic site and the disulphide bridge in the catalytic site is transferred to two cysteine residues located on the flexible c-terminus. the c-terminus arm then swings out of the catalytic site and this disulphide bridge is finally reduced by glutaredoxin or thioredoxin to reactivate the rnr holoenzyme  <cit> . when examined using sds-page, non-reducing conditions cause rnr1p to resolve as two bands: the top band  represents the oxidized form  and the lower, high-mobility band represents the reduced form. when proteins are extracted under reducing conditions, only the lower band of reduced rnr1p is evident  <cit> .

we found that under non-reducing conditions  rnr1p from the control strain grown on ypd was resolved on immunoblots into reduced rnr1p and oxidized rnr1p . in contrast, protein extracts of pa-expressing yeast showed the reduced form of rnr1p , but little or none of the oxidized form. interestingly, an intense band of ~155 kda, the expected size of a complex consisting of pap  and rnr1p, was also observed from the pa-expressing yeast strain. when protein was extracted under reducing conditions  the band corresponding to oxidized rnr1p was absent in both strains while both strains exhibited the reduced form of rnr1p. furthermore, the 155 kda band that putatively represented the complex of pap and rnr1p remained present under these strong reducing conditions. proteins extracted from the control and pa-expressing strains grown in ypraf/gal medium had no observable differences in the total amount of rnr1p or the ratio of reduced to oxidized rnr1p under reducing or non-reducing protein extraction conditions . in addition, the ~155 kda band was absent from extracts of both strains grown in ypraf/gal medium. note that we verified the molecular weight of the oxidized and reduced rnr1p bands using a strain that overexpresses rnr1p . these results indicated that a non-reducible pap-rnr1p complex is formed, but only when pap is expressed at low levels.

to test whether the 155 kda signal comprises rnr1p and pap, we subjected native-form proteins to size exclusion chromatography. for immunodetection, the flag epitope was inserted between hph and the pa incompatibility domain and this construct was inserted into gal <dig> to obtain the yeast strain “pa”. we verified that this strain exhibited incompatibility-like activity when grown on ypd medium . as a control, we inserted the flag epitope after the hph gene, and obtained a “control ” strain. when proteins were extracted from control and pa yeast grown in ypd and subjected to size exclusion chromatography, rnr1p was detected predominantly in fraction  <dig> . the 155 kda signal that putatively represents a complex of the pa protein  and rnr1p was detected in fraction  <dig> and, consistent with previous results, was only observed in proteins extracted from the pa-expressing strain. when probed with anti-flag antibodies, the flag signal was not detected in fractionated proteins extracted from the control strain but was visible in fraction  <dig> from the pa yeast . we note that this band was weak in intensity. however, this would be expected as expression from the gal <dig> promoter is minimal in the presence of glucose  and results in very low-levels of gal <dig> regulated protein  <cit> . furthermore, we note that multiple attempts to pull down this complex using a variety of techniques  were not successful. nevertheless, these results suggested that the 155 kda signal was composed of both yeast rnr1p and the pa incompatibility domain. interestingly, only pap, and not the control protein, could be detected during low-level expression using anti-flag antibody. this suggests that pap was being sequestered within this complex, effectively increasing its overall concentration in the cell.

pap interacts with ssa1p, an hsp <dig> protein, when pap is over-expressed
we investigated the counterintuitive observations noted earlier that pap expressed at low , but not at high-levels , caused incompatibility-like symptoms in yeast. immunoblots were done with proteins extracted under reducing conditions from pa and control yeast grown in ypraf/gal . using anti-flag antibody, we observed a ~41 kda signal in the control strain, which corresponds to the control fusion protein, and two bands of ~ <dig> and ~85 kda in the pa strain. the smaller of these latter two proteins is the expected size of pap while the larger protein was immunopurified and identified by mass spectroscopy to contain sequences of ssa1p, an hsp <dig> homolog . we concluded that this band is a complex formed between ssa1p and pap since it was larger than the expected mass of ssa1p  and binds to anti-flag antibodies. we note that the majority of pap in ypraf/gal-grown cells was associated with ssa1p since the ~85 kda signal was significantly more intense than the ~55 kda signal. interestingly, size exclusion chromatography showed that pap is only in fractions that contain ssa1p indicating that nearly all of the detectable pap was complexed with ssa1p . this pap-ssa1p complex is quite stable since treatment with reducing agents liberated some, but not all pap from the ssa1p complex. furthermore, in a strain with ssa <dig> deleted, different chaperone proteins, ssb2p, or hsp <dig>  tightly complexed with the pap . we note that several hsp <dig> proteins, including both ssa1p and ssb2p, assist in protein folding  <cit>  and have been observed to interact with aggregating proteins  <cit> . therefore, it appears that ssa1p and ssb2p/hsp <dig> effectively bind to the pap incompatibility factor when it is overexpressed in yeast.

discussion
we define a protein domain with incompatibility function in rnr from n. crassa and demonstrate it can elicit an incompatibility-like reaction in yeast. previous studies have examined trans-species expression of fungal nonself recognition genes in closely related filamentous fungi  <cit> . in particular, expression of n. crassa tol results in mat-associated heterokaryon incompatibility in neurospora tetrasperma <cit> , and pa alleles of n. crassa het-c appear to produce growth defects reminiscent of heterokaryon incompatibility in podospora anserina <cit>  and aspergillus niger <cit> . unlike these previous studies, we extended the confirmation of incompatibility activity to a functional analysis of the un- <dig> nonself recognition system, initiating an understanding of its mechanisms. interestingly, and unlike the filamentous fungi, a vegetative incompatibility system has not been described in yeast and in silico experiments showed that yeast lacks homologs to several heterokaryon incompatibility domains found in filamentous ascomycete fungi  <cit> . nevertheless, our work shows that such a system can operate in yeast. as demonstrated here, heterologous expression of nonself recognition factors in yeast can also lead to fundamental insights into mechanisms of activity and control of nonself recognition factors. in such a system, core interactions of incompatibility domains can be studied without a confounding effect of other potentially interacting incompatibility factors. in the future, it would be interesting to determine if these incompatibility reactions can be enhanced in the yeast system by the addition of other known incompatibility factors from n. crassa. for example, it is known that the allelic un- <dig> incompatibility in n. crassa is significantly strengthened by non-allelic interactions with het- <dig> factors  <cit> .

one emerging trend observed with heterokaryon incompatibility systems is the involvement of protein-protein interactions that trigger cell death. this is particularly evident in the het-c system of n. crassa <cit>  and the het-s system in p. anserina <cit> . our results indicate that un-24-associated incompatibility is likewise mediated by protein interactions. when expressed at low levels, the pap domain apparently forms a complex with rnr1p that results in incompatibility-like phenotypes in yeast. the observed “toxicity” of the rnr1p-pap complex in yeast is consistent with incompatibility associated with coexpression of pa and or alleles of un- <dig> in n. crassa <cit>  and with a recently published study that demonstrates that the c-terminus of un-24pa is able to form a non-reducible complex with un-24or in n. crassa, the presence of which is correlated with incompatibility  <cit> . unlike n. crassa where there is a single gene  encoding the rnr large subunit, yeast contains the paralogs rnr <dig> and rnr3; rnr <dig> is cell-cycle regulated and used under normal cellular growth, and rnr <dig> is upregulated in response to dna damage  <cit> . the partial redundancy of rnr1p and rnr3p may alleviate some toxic effects of expressing pap in yeast. interestingly, yeast that lack rnr <dig> have reduced vacuolar atpase activity  <cit> , have increased sensitivity to antifungal agents  <cit>  and to hydroxyurea  <cit> , have an increased cell size  <cit>  and have a longer cell cycle  <cit>   -- all of which are consistent with the effects of pap expression in yeast that are presented herein. the association of an rnr1p-pap complex with several incompatibility-like phenotypes suggests that pap incompatibility activity operates in yeast through a loss or reduction in rnr catalytic function, a hypothesis that is consistent with the endogenous activity of un- <dig> that should now be examined closely in n. crassa.

our insights on trans-species activity of pap in yeast may have a bearing on two other interesting characteristics of incompatibility systems in filamentous fungi. specifically, that hsp <dig> proteins alleviate pap-associated incompatibility in yeast may suggest that chaperones have roles in the “escape” process, and in suppressing heterokaryon incompatibility in stages leading up to and during the sexual cycle  <cit> . escape is defined as a sudden shift from the incompatible state  to a wild-type morphology and growth rate  <cit> . the mechanism of escape is often correlated with large deletions, rearrangements and other mutations of incompatibility genes  <cit> . likewise, how multiple incompatibility genes in filamentous fungi are inactivated during the sexual cycle is a mystery that may be generally relevant to a dampening of nonself recognition to permit zygote development within the mother in other sexually reproducing organisms. along this line, some heat shock proteins are specifically expressed in perithecia and in unfertilized sexual tissues in n. crassa <cit> .

it is interesting to note that, in addition to functioning as chaperone proteins, hsp <dig> family members are upregulated during cellular stress and can bind to and facilitate degradation of toxic, abnormal protein complexes  <cit> . we surmise that alleviation of incompatibility-like phenotypes upon pap overexpression in yeast may occur through two mechanisms. first, ssa1p has been observed to sequester toxic protein precursors in yeast to prevent them from aggregating  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that, upon high-level expression, pap is specifically targeted by ssa1p prior to its interaction with rnr1p and that low-level expression of pap is insufficient to trigger ssa1p for sequestration but sufficient enough to result in toxicity. secondly, ssa1p may assist in the degradation of non-reducible pap-rnr1p complexes. ssa1p has been shown to interact with partially degraded protein aggregates  <cit>  and has been implicated in transferring misfolded proteins to the yeast proteasome for degradation  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that the amount of non-complexed pap observed in figure  <dig> should be sufficient  to cause the incompatibility-like phenotypes. as with other instances where heat shock proteins interact with and/or degrade toxic protein complexes, it is likely that the mechanism by which ssa1p alleviates the toxicity of pap is more complex than the simple explanations offered above. as such, we currently do not have a robust model for the role of ssa1p in modulating pap toxicity. nevertheless, the clear correlation we observe between the formation of a ssa1p-pap complex and the amelioration of incompatibility-like phenotypes in yeast poses questions about whether hsp <dig> proteins play a role in escape and in modulating incompatibility during the sexual cycle in n. crassa and other organisms.

finally, due to its essential function and evolutionary conserved structure, type i rnrs represent attractive drug targets. indeed, the development of peptide inhibitors that disrupt the quaternary structure or activity of rnr is a field that may present a relatively safe and efficacious chemotherapeutic strategy  <cit> . ironically, inherent within the n. crassa large subunit of rnr already lies the potential for a strain-specific antibiotic-like activity, as manifested by the growth inhibition of cells resulting from nonself fusions in n. crassa. the trans-species inhibitory activity of pap in yeast further suggests that the un- <dig> incompatibility domain may present insights into a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide that can be targeted to selected species or strains.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a novel nonself recognition domain located in the c-terminus of un- <dig>  our results demonstrated that the pa, but not the or, c-terminus retains activity when expressed in s. cerevisiae. we demonstrate that low-level expression of pa results in several incompatibility-like cytologies, an increase in cell size and the formation of a complex consisting of yeast rnr1p and pa. these phenomena are resolved when pa is expressed at high level, where an apparent complex between ssa1p and pa forms. results from our study indicate that yeast can be used to investigate nonself recognition systems. furthermore, our study shows that hsp <dig> proteins can alleviate incompatibility, which may suggest their involvement in the escape process or in the sexual cycle of n. crassa. finally, given the unique trans-species activity of the pa protein, and the ubiquitous and evolutionarily well conserved target, rnr, it would be interesting to determine if variations of this protein have applications as chemotherapeutic agents.
