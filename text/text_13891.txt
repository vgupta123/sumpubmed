BACKGROUND
radial glial cells have been recently demonstrated to be the progenitors for the majority of the central nervous system  neurons  <cit> . they arise early in the development of the cns, from the neuroepithelial cells lining the ventricles, around the time neurons start to appear  <cit> . radial glial cells extend a long radial process to the pial surface while having their cell bodies in the ventricular zone , and thus allowing the migration of neurons from the vz to the postmitotic areas  <cit> . however, the finding that these cells can also give birth to the migratory neurons via their asymmetric division  <cit>  further highlighted the significance of these cells in brain development. interestingly, radial glial cells disappear or transform into astrocytes in most regions of the mammalian brain after neuronal generation and migration are completed  <cit> .

brain lipid binding protein  is a nervous system-specific member of the large family of hydrophobic ligand binding proteins and is exclusively expressed in radial glia and astrocytes during development throughout the cns  <cit> . a recent elegant study using cre/loxp fate mapping, showed that all neuronal population in the mouse brain are derived from radial glial cells expressing blbp  <cit> .

recently, blbp expression in cortical radial glia as well as its role in radial process extension was found to be dependent on reelin expression  <cit> . reelin is a large secreted glycoprotein, which has been shown to be an important signal for neuronal migration and proper positioning of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum  <cit> . reelin signal is transmitted into the cells by disabled- <dig> , a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that binds the internalization  motif of the reelin receptors, apolipoprotein receptor <dig>  and the very low density lipoprotein receptor , via its phospho-tyrosine binding  domain  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of dab- <dig> is initiated after reelin binding to its receptors  <cit> , forming new binding sites for src kinases  <cit> . mice deficient in, vldlr and apoer <dig>  dab- <dig> or dab- <dig> that cannot be tyrosine phosphorylated generates a reeler-like phenotype, which is characterized by inversion of the cortical layers and abnormalities in the laminated brain structures  <cit> .

reelin effect on blbp expression requires dab- <dig> as well, as it failed to occur in dab-1-/- mice  <cit> . reeler and dab- <dig> mutant mice were shown to exhibit abnormal development of the radial glia scaffold in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus  <cit> . furthermore, components of the reelin signaling pathway, including vldlr, apoer <dig>  and dab <dig> were shown to be expressed in both the hippocampul and cortical radial glia  <cit> . interestingly, reelin addition in-vitro has been shown not only to promote the process extension of the radial glial cells but also to rescue the defects in the length of these processes in the reeler mutant radial glia  <cit> .

a recent study showed that notch- <dig> signaling could also regulate the molecular and the morphological differentiation of radial glia through the transcriptional activation of brain lipid binding protein   <cit> . notch is a single-pass transmembrane protein that was initially identified in drosophila and has been shown to mediate many developmental signaling events  <cit> . notch- <dig> activation, upon binding its ligand, will initiate its cleavage by γ-secretase to generate notch- <dig> intracellular domain . nicd translocates to the nucleus and binds c-promoter binding factor  <dig> , converting it from transcriptional repressor to transcriptional activator  <cit> . interestingly, blbp expression was found to be dependent on this pathway as well  <cit> , where a binding site for the notch- <dig> effectors' cbf <dig> was found in the promoter region of blbp  <cit> .

since notch- <dig> activation can induce both the radial glial phenotype and their transformation into astrocytes  <cit> , we hypothesized that reelin signaling may act to fine-tune notch- <dig> activation favoring the induction of the radial glial phenotype prenataly. this in turn can explain how the degeneration of the cells that produces reelin in the cortex coincides with transformation of the radial glial cells into astrocytes postnataly  <cit> . in our study, in vitro addition of reelin to human neural progenitor cells , isolated from the cortex of  <dig> weeks old fetus, induced blbp expression and a radial glial phenotype similar to that induced by notch- <dig> activation. the inhibition of notch- <dig> activation by inhibiting the activity of γ-secretase abolished reelin's effect, suggesting the dependency of reelin signaling on notch- <dig> activation. furthermore, reelin treatment increased the level of nicd, indicating that reelin can directly activate notch- <dig>  finally, dab- <dig> was observed to bind to notch- <dig>  thus providing an evidence of the physical interaction between these two pathways.

RESULTS
reelin treatment in vitro induces a radial glial phenotype similar to notch- <dig> activation
reelin addition in vitro has been recently shown to promote the process extension of the radial glial cells and to rescue the defects in the length of these processes in the reeler mutant radial glia  <cit> . to test if reelin signaling acts on notch- <dig> activation to promote the radial glial phenotype, we first compared the induced radial glial phenotype obtained after reelin treatment and notch- <dig> activation. nicd overexpression was used to mimic notch- <dig> activation.

it has been reported that fgf and egf signaling can also promote the radial glial phenotype  <cit> . in order to characterize only the effects of reelin treatment or notch- <dig> activation on hnpcs, we deprived the cells from these growth factors for  <dig> hours before reelin addition or nicd over expression . the deprivation of these growth factors reduced the radial glial phenotype, which was characterized by the retraction of the processes in the gfap positive cells . the cells were then treated with partially purified reelin  or transfected with nicd for  <dig> hours before fixation.

as a result, reelin treatment was observed to induce a radial glial phenotype, which was characterized by increased process extension in the gfap positive cells , similar to that obtained by notch- <dig> activation .

to confirm that reelin treatment activates reelin signaling in hnpcs, we measured the phosphorylation level of the tyrosine residue  <dig> of dab- <dig> after treating the cells with reelin for  <dig> minutes,  <dig> minutes and  <dig> hour. dab- <dig> phosphorylation increased after reelin treatment, whereas it remained constant with the control treatment , indicating that these cells are responsive to reelin.

reelin-induced radial glial phenotype is dependent on γ-secretase activity
to test the dependency of reelin signaling on notch- <dig> activation to induce the radial glial phenotype, we blocked nicd release by inhibiting γ-secretase activity. the cells were deprived of fgf and egf for  <dig> hours and then treated with partially purified reelin and  <dig> μm of the γ-secretase inhibitor  for another  <dig> hours before analysis .

as expected, reelin treatment and nicd overexpression up-regulated blbp expression and induced a bipolar radial morphology . the induced radial glial phenotype was determined by finding the percentage of the gfap positive cells that had induced blbp expression and a bipolar morphology with at least one thin process longer than  <dig> μm.

as a result, we found that the percentage of the radial glial cells increased from  <dig>  % in the control-treated cells to  <dig> % in the reelin-treated cells > qcritical  by post-hoc tukey t test) . the inhibition of γ-secretase activity in the reelin-treated cells reduced the percentage of the radial glial cells back to  <dig>  % > qcritical  by post-hoc tukey t test) . these data suggest the dependency of reelin on the activity of γ-secretase to induce the radial glial phenotype in hnpcs.

reelin treatment activates notch-1
to determine if reelin affect notch- <dig> signaling, we measured the protein level of nicd by western blotting using an antibody that can recognize only the activated form of notch- <dig> . as a result, reelin treatment significantly increased nicd level by  <dig>  fold when compared to control treatment > qcritical by post-hoc tukey t test). in contrast, the inhibition of γ-secretase activity in the reelin-treated cells reduced nicd level back to  <dig>  fold > qcritical  by post-hoc tukey t test) .

since notch- <dig> has the npxy motif that is recognized by dab-1's ptb domain  <cit> , we tested if dab- <dig> binds to notch- <dig>  the cells were transfected with flag tagged dab- <dig> for  <dig> hours . an immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the flag tag on the c-terminal of dab- <dig> was able to co-immunoprecipitate full-length notch- <dig> . similarly, an immunoprecipitation using an antibody recognizing notch- <dig> co-immunprecipitated dab- <dig> . these results indicate that full-length notch- <dig> and dab- <dig> can interact.

we also investigated if dab- <dig> can bind to the nicd. the cells were transfected with flag tagged dab- <dig> for  <dig> hours. dab- <dig> was detected when the protein samples were immunoprecipitated using an antibody that recognizes only nicd . similarly, when the protein samples were immunoprecipitated by antibody recognizing the flag tag on the c-terminal of dab- <dig>  nicd was detected . these results indicate that dab- <dig> does not only bind to full-length notch <dig> but also to the nicd.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
reelin and notch- <dig> signaling pathways have been recently found to be necessary to induce the expression of blbp and to promote the process extension and the maturation of the neuronal progenitors, the radial glial cells  <cit> .

the end of neurogenesis in the cortex is marked by the transformation of the radial glial cells into astrocytes  <cit> . notch- <dig> activation has been known for its role in promoting both phenotypes, the formation of the radial glial cells and their transformation into astrocytes. interestingly, notch- <dig> activation has been shown to induce radial glial cells differentiation prenataly and to induce astrocytic differentiation postnataly  <cit> . therefore, the presence of other signaling pathways that act to induce the radial glial phenotype prenataly but are deactivated or downregulated postnataly seems to be an attractive model to explain how notch- <dig> activation leads to different cellular fates at different developmental stages.

reelin signaling has been recently shown to induce the radial glial phenotype in vitro and to rescue the defects in the reeler mutant radial glia  <cit> . interestingly, cajal-retzius cells, the cells that produce reelin in the cortical marginal zone, are thought to either degenerate postnatally  <cit>  or undergo developmental dilution  <cit> .

here, we propose that reelin signaling promotes notch- <dig> activation to favor the radial glial phenotype prenataly. to test our hypothesis, we used human neural progenitor cells that were isolated form the cortex of  <dig> weeks fetus. we show that these cells responded to reelin treatment by inducing a bipolar morphology in the gfap positive cell indicating the formation of radial glia . since this reelin-induced phenotype was dependent on γ-secretase activity , and since reelin treatment increased the level of nicd , then we concluded that reelin signaling promote the radial glial phenotype by activating notch- <dig> 

reelin signaling might regulate notch- <dig> activation via dab- <dig> binding to notch- <dig> . it's possible that reelin signaling mediated by dab- <dig>  increases the nicd level by either increasing notch- <dig> processing by γ-secretase or by stabilizing the released nicd. since dab- <dig> has been recently shown to act as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein  <cit> , dab- <dig> may in turn mediate the translocation of nicd into the nucleus to activate downstream genes such as blbp. however, the exact mechanism needs further elucidation.

taken together, this study offers a new insight of how reelin and notch- <dig> signaling are determining that fate of the neural progenitor cells and maintaining the radial glial phenotype in the developing brain.
