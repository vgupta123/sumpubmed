BACKGROUND
retrotransposons replicate intracellularly through reverse transcription of their rna and integration of the resulting cdna into another locus of the host genome. two main groups of retrotransposons are recognized: the long terminal repeat  retrotransposons that have long terminal repeats at both ends; and the non-ltr retrotransposons that are lacking terminal repeats but contain a polyadenylate sequence at their 3' termini. ltr retrotransposons are the most abundant components of eukaryotic genomes. the two major classes are ty1-copia and the ty3-gypsy elements. both ty1-copia and ty3-gypsy elements contain two major genes, gag and pol. these genes produce polyproteins, which are subsequently cleaved into functional peptides by an element-encoded protease. the gag gene encodes structural proteins important for the packaging of retrotransposonal rna, while the pol gene encodes enzymes essential for the retrotransposon life cycle  <cit> .

while mammalian genomes largely have the non-ltr retrotransposons, such as alu repeats with more than  <dig> million copies comprising roughly 10% of the human genome  <cit> , plants contain mainly ltr retrotransposons. moreover, it appears that while mammalian genomes vary within a narrow range in their genome sizes, plant genomes vary extensively in part due to the differential amplification of ltr retrotransposons in different species. for instance, rice is about six times smaller than maize and its content of class i elements, excluding non-ltr retrotransposons, is about 18% while in the maize genome it represents 55%  <cit> . it also has been suggested that genome size can decrease due to deletion of class i elements  <cit> . the ubiquity of ltr retrotransposons in plant genomes is also illustrated by the nesting effect  <cit> , where a young element inserts into an older element, originally described for the adh <dig> locus in maize  <cit> .

mobile elements have shaped both genes and entire genomes  <cit> . they usually insert into intergenic regions and are silenced to prevent additional rounds of amplification. nevertheless, it would be simplistic to assume that they do not play a functional role. contrary to the previously anticipated lack of functionality of tes, it appears that they are indeed part of the transcriptome of different plant species  <cit> , which correlates well with the fact that a subset of retroelements is hypomethylated  <cit> . it also has been shown that specific retrotransposon families are found in centromeric regions and possibly play a role in centromere function  <cit> . furthermore, tes have been reported to affect gene expression. recently, tos <dig>  a copia-like retrotransposon, was found to become active in rice tissue, but silenced when plants were regenerated  <cit> . because new insertion events in regenerated plants become heritable, they have been mapped to the genome and found to function in gene inactivation  <cit> .

accumulation of completely sequenced genomes provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the contribution of tes to gene structure and gene function. in caenorhabditis elegans the majority of ltr retrotransposons are located in or near genes  <cit> . computational analyses of the sequenced human genome indicate that retrotransposon sequences are located in the coding regions of at least 4% of the genes  <cit> , and in the promoter regions of at least 25% of the genes  <cit> . in the drosophila melanogaster genome, 2% of the genes  are spatially associated with an ltr retrotransposon sequence   <cit> .

genomic structure and gene expression can be affected by dna rearrangements, such as deletions or translocations, caused by retrotransposition. given such range of activities and rapid amplification it has been suggested to apply a different substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutations per site per year for plant ltr retrotransposons when compared to plant genes  <cit> . therefore, previous estimates of retrotransposon insertions will have to be re-evaluated  <cit> . furthermore, in previous studies, the analysis of the retrotransposon content has been confined to single chromosomal regions consisting mostly of single bac clones  <cit> .

to better understand how transposable elements have influenced the evolution of chromosomal regions of common ancestry in plants we have examined the content of tes and their times of insertion within five chromosomal intervals across three grass species: maize, sorghum, and rice . each region of tetraploid maize is represented by two homoeologous sequences depicting the whole-genome duplication  event. the orthology  of the studied regions was established from the structural alignment of orthologous genes  <cit> . consistent with previous reports, we found that retrotransposons contribute to an increase in genome size in all three taxa; however, the intensity, spatiality, and directionality are considerably different among the grasses. an unexpected finding of intact genes within ltr retrotransposons highlights the possibility of their involvement in genomic rearrangements resulting in gene non-collinearity among related taxa.

RESULTS
comparisons of ltr retrotransposons in five orthologous regions of the maize, sorghum, and rice genomes
we selected a total of  <dig> genomic clones covering five chromosomal regions of common ancestry from the sorghum, rice, and maize genomes . each maize chromosomal region was represented by two homoeologous sequences as the products of wgd . within the five regions we identified a total of  <dig> ltr retrotransposons . the ltr retrotransposons comprise  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the genomic sequences of maize, rice, and sorghum, respectively. unlike maize that contains ltr retrotransposons in all studied regions, the orp1/orp <dig>  r1/b <dig>  and tbp1/tbp <dig> regions of sorghum and c1/p <dig>  tb1/tb <dig> regions of rice lack ltr retrotransposons. the number of ltr insertions per studied region is between  <dig> to  <dig> in maize,  <dig> to  <dig> in rice, and  <dig> to  <dig> in sorghum. in contrast to rice and sorghum a total of  <dig> solo ltrs have been identified in the maize regions. these solo ltrs are the remnants of full ltrs after recombination.

the cumulative length of the five pairs of homoeologous regions in maize is  <dig>  kb, within which we identified  <dig> ltr retrotransposons. therefore, on average, there is one ltr retrotransposon every  <dig>  kb of genomic sequence. the two major classes of those are copia-like ltr retrotransposons with  <dig> % and gypsy-like ltr retrotransposons with  <dig> % . the most abundant ltr retrotransposon families in these regions are huck, ji, and opie accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, of the ltr retrotransposons, respectively. the average size of intact huck, ji, and opie retrotransposon is  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb, respectively. these three ltr retrotransposons, occupying  <dig>  kb, represent  <dig> % of the  <dig>  kb genomic sequence of maize. similar estimates were obtained from randomly sheared dna end-sequences  <cit> . because the chromosomal regions analyzed in this study were selected according to their known genetic markers, one could expect lower retrotransposon density than in any other genomic region. on the contrary, it appears that retrotransposons are not clustered in any region of the maize genome, but have penetrated euchromatic and heterochromatic regions on a random basis.

nested ltr retrotransposons
the first genomic regions of the maize genome that have been sequenced contain both nested ltr retrotransposons as well as single retrotransposons  <cit> . the same pattern extends to the maize regions studied here. in two of the sorghum regions we identified three ltr retrotransposons, two of which were nested within the c1/pl <dig> region . in rice only three of the five studied regions contained ltr retrotransposons and none of them appeared to be nested. this finding differs from earlier studies of other rice regions  <cit> , indicating that within the rice genome there are islands of various intensities of transposition activity. out of  <dig> ltr retrotransposons identified in the studied regions,  <dig> are nested within another ltr retrotransposon . the maize orp <dig> region contains the largest number of ltr retrotransposons and also holds a three-layer nested ltr-retrotransposon structure . apparently, these nested structures are the primary source of gene density reduction in chromosomal regions. although an ltr retrotransposon can insert into another member of the same family , most insertions are heterogeneous . events causing chromosomal reduction, contemporaneous to chromosomal expansion, are deletions of ltr retrotransposons as exemplified by the ji solo ltr nested in a prem- <dig> element within the maize tb <dig> region of chromosome 5s.

ltr-retrotransposon insertion times
integration of an ltr retrotransposon requires duplication of the ltr sequence. therefore, the two ltrs of an inserted element are identical at the time of insertion. as time passes, nucleotide substitutions cause sequence divergence between the two ltrs. if the substitution rate is known, then the date of insertion can be estimated from the amount of divergence between the two ltrs  <cit> . in a recent study of the rice genome, ma and bennetzen  <cit>  showed that the average level of nucleotide substitution in intergenic regions  is about 2-fold higher than that of synonymous substitution in coding regions of genes . therefore, we applied a substitution rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> mutations per site per year as described previously  <cit>  and calculated the time of insertion of the ltr retrotransposons identified within the studied segments . although among nested retrotransposons the insertion time of an internal ltr retrotransposon should be younger than the recipient one, there appeared to be a few exceptions in the maize regions. however, when we calculated 95% confidence intervals for the time estimates of ltr insertions using the mega <dig> program  <cit> , the estimates for the ltr retrotransposons that are embedded in other ltr retrotransposons exhibit overlapping intervals with the recipient elements . therefore, we cannot be certain whether there are exceptions to the general pattern of a younger ltr retrotransposon inserting to an older ltr retrotransposon.

the orp1/ <dig> regions contain most of the older ltr retrotransposons. among these are the ji- <dig> from the maize orp <dig> region , the dagul  from rice, and also the oldest ltr retrotransposon within the studied segments, the prem- <dig> from maize orp <dig> region . the ji- <dig> and fasu from the r <dig> region, the prem- <dig> and ji in the c <dig> region, and the yemi in the tb <dig> region  are the most recently inserted ltr retrotransposons. all ltr retrotransposons identified within the c1/p <dig> and tbp1/ <dig> regions inserted less than  <dig> mya. all the ltr retrotransposons identified in the rice and sorghum fragments inserted within the last one million years. about 75% of the  <dig> intact ltrs inserted into their host genome less than  <dig> mya.

contribution of ltr retrotransposons to gene order in the maize genome
in most cases, we found that retrotransposons were interspersed between genic sequences; however in  <dig> of the  <dig> maize regions  we detected a total of  <dig> predicted genes or gene fragments that were embedded within ltr retrotransposons. these accounted for 15% of all putative genes in these regions. to further investigate the nature of these insertions, we looked at these two regions in more detail.

first we analyzed the orp <dig> region where we found one intact and four fragmented genes nested in a ji- <dig> retrotransposon . to reconstruct the history of insertion events, the nucleotide sequence of this ji- <dig> retrotransposon was aligned with the full-length consensus sequence of a ji element that was obtained from multiple sequence alignments of all ji elements identified in the studied regions with additional sequences identified from database searches . based on this alignment, the ji- <dig> retrotransposon has a length of  <dig>  nucleotides after exclusion of inserted sequences between the target duplication sites  and arrived at this location about  <dig>  mya. the polyprotein-coding region is truncated at position  <dig>  , where a complex set of sequences of different origins is inserted. this set contains a milt element  that arrived in its location about  <dig>  mya, an opie retrotransposon  that inserted  <dig>  mya, and, more importantly, it also includes five non-te related genes of which one is intact. with these multiple insertions the ji- <dig> element expanded by a total of  <dig>  nucleotides. while insertion of retrotransposons into other retrotransposons is well documented from other regions of maize as well as other plant genomes, finding an intact gene embedded in a retroelement was unexpected. in contrary, the only example of the insertion of non-te related genes into a retrotransposon are gene fragments embedded in a huck retrotransposon within the  <dig> locus of the maize inbred line mo <dig> that are unlikely to be functional  <cit> .

here, the intact gene found within the ji- <dig> element belongs to a group of genes known to be important for seed development, also called the fie <dig>  gene  <cit> . the four fragmented genes embedded within the ji- <dig> retrotransposon are encoded by the opposite dna strand compared to the fie <dig> gene and are copies of the ve- <dig> gene   belonging to a group of disease resistance genes  <cit> . interestingly, two intact copies of the ve- <dig> gene reside in the upstream region outside of the ji- <dig> element. sequence comparison of the ve- <dig> gene homologs from the rice genome uncovered a pattern of sequence fragmentation in the maize ve- <dig> genes, indicative of independent truncations of all ve- <dig> maize genes during or after their amplification. however, the lack of sufficient overlapping sequence homologies prevented us from performing phylogenetic analyses. the external position of two of the ve- <dig> genes  leads to the hypothesis that the ve- <dig> genes internal to the ji- <dig> element might have arisen from one or both of the ve- <dig> genes external to the ji- <dig> element. perhaps, insertion of gene fragments in non-collinear chromosomal positions might be a more common theme as previously suggested  <cit> .

for the intact fie <dig> gene phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  and expression data  <cit>  are already available. there are two fie genes in the maize genome that reside in homoeologous regions on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the orthologous regions in rice and sorghum each contain a tandem duplication of the fie gene. phylogenetic analysis of the fie genes revealed that the two maize genes represent the two ancestral paralogs, indicating a deletion of two paralogous copies after the hybridization of the two maize progenitors  <cit> . furthermore, the two tandem genes in rice and the fie <dig> gene on maize chromosome  <dig> do not reside within a retrotransposon. therefore, the fie <dig> gene on the maize chromosome  <dig> must have been inserted from a close location in this genomic region into the ji- <dig> element, but unlike the ve- <dig> genes as intact gene. in addition, it is interesting to note the difference in expression of the two fie genes in maize. the fie <dig> gene, nested in an ltr retrotransposon, is expressed in the embryo sac before pollination, while the non-nested fie <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> is expressed exclusively in the endosperm of developing kernels at ~ <dig> days after pollination  <cit> . it is unknown whether this difference in gene expression is based on the regulatory elements of the ltr retrotransposon flanking the fie <dig> gene, but it has been suggested that ltr retrotransposons located in or near genes might alter gene expression and, therefore, contribute significantly to gene evolution  <cit> .

the other region with a complex of predicted genes nested within ltr retrotransposons was the tbp <dig> region . for further analysis, we selected the two copies of the intact auxin-related genes. to assess their abundance within the genome we searched the collection of maize gsss, representing a high proportion of the maize genic regions, and found evidence for additional copies of these genes in other regions of the maize genome. because these gsss do not cover complete gene sequences, we only selected the two genes within the retroelement for comparison with homologs of the fully sequenced rice genome. homologous genes are also found in many non-orthologous regions of the rice genome  <cit> . we estimated that the huck- <dig> element arrived at this location  about  <dig>  mya, while the opie element inserted in this region about  <dig>  mya . phylogenetic analysis of the predicted auxin-related genes from this region with those identified in rice  revealed that the two maize genes were duplicated long before  the insertion of the ltr retrotransposons, indicating that both genes existed in different positions of the maize genome and moved to this location recently.

discussion
contribution of ltr retrotransposons to plant genome evolution
rice diverged from maize and sorghum about  <dig> mya  <cit>  and sorghum diverged from maize about  <dig> mya  <cit> . after speciation, regions descending from ancestral chromosomes largely stayed intact for a long time as exemplified by retention of collinearity among these taxa  <cit> . our results indicate that all three genomes independently experienced relatively recent ltr activity and their intensities varied among the different grass species. compared to maize, rice has a relatively small genome with about  <dig> mb. although we did not find solo ltr retrotransposons in our studied rice regions, it has been reported that out of  <dig>  ltr retrotransposons,  <dig> appeared to be fragmented elements  <cit> . the high rate of ltr retrotransposon deletions in rice may be one of the reasons that some rice regions may appear to have fewer nested ltr retrotransposons than the maize genome. recently, it has also been suggested that the size of the rice genome decreased due to the higher proportion of solo ltrs versus intact retrotransposons  <cit> . the contraction coupled with the lack of expansion due to the lack of nesting could explain the differential retrotransposon density between maize and rice. therefore, genome size differences in plants result from several mechanisms. if low density of retrotransposons in the orthologous regions of sorghum holds up on a genome-wide level, other mechanisms for the expansion of sorghum versus rice might still be uncovered. one interesting feature of retroelements is that they provide sites for additional insertions, which could have accelerated the expansion of the maize genome relative to rice.

association of ltr retrotransposons and functional genes
given the abundance of retrotransposition events, the question arose as to how they might influence the expression of genes. indeed, retrotransposons are involved in generating mutations through insertions near or within genes and affect their expression, usually in a negative fashion by decreasing or abolishing transcription of a gene or by detrimental alterations in transcript processing and/or stability. retrotransposons inserted in or near plant genes have been reported in maize, rice, lettuce, wheat, tomato, tobacco, potato, and bell pepper  <cit> . here, we have found that the predicted gene rnap ii in the maize orp <dig> region is only  <dig> bp away from the milt- <dig> retrotransposon. similarly to plant genomes retrotransposons seem to be important modulators of animal genomes as well. approximately 2% of the genes  in the drosophila melanogaster genome are associated with an ltr retrotransposon sequence  <cit> . in another case, the gene peg <dig> is critical for mouse parthenogenetic development and provides the first direct evidence of an essential role of an evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived gene in mammalian development  <cit> .

gene movement within the maize genome
while numerous studies showed that ltr retrotransposons could arrive near or within genes, our finding of intact genes located inside ltr retrotransposons was unanticipated. previous comparative studies already showed that non-collinear genes have moved to other locations within the same genome  <cit> . one of the possible mechanisms of gene movement appears to be based on the action of helitrons  <cit> . in such a case it is hypothesized that the replication of a sequence containing a gene is initiated by the action of a helicase similarly to the initiation of replication of single-stranded bacteriophage. this mode of replication is also referred to as rolling circle  replication because the product is a single-stranded circular dna. as a consequence one can expect that the donor site would stay intact and the extrachromosomal circular dna gets integrated at another site by illegitimate recombination. however so far, helitron sequences appear to contain only gene fragments and not intact genes  <cit> . in case of the fie <dig> gene, there is no donor site present in the rest of the genome. we have searched maize inbred lines for a haplotype progenitor that would contain a putative donor site for the fie <dig> gene. however, when we compared about  <dig> different inbred lines, there was no line where the fie <dig> gene site differed from inbred b <dig> . since a previous analysis of haplotype variability of the z1c <dig> locus suggested four major haplotypes among the core inbred lines, we would have expected that, if it exists, we would have found a second haplotype of the fie <dig> locus among the inbreds analyzed. although we cannot be certain if the original site of the fie <dig> gene was deleted after it moved into the retrotransposon or if the gene was excised and then re-inserted into the retrotransposon, its translocation mechanism appears to differ from the examples of helitron-based gene movements. even with the retention of sequences at a donor site that contain genes, new gene copies do not have to arise from an rc-based amplification. for instance, gene insertions of copies of storage protein genes occurred during the last  <dig> million years in six different locations of the maize genome, relative to the rice genome by a mechanism that differs from helitrons  <cit> . disease resistance genes are another example of recent insertions of gene copies into new chromosomal positions  <cit> . whatever the mechanism for copying or excising genes might be, insertion into the genome requires a chromosome break. perhaps retroelements are more prone to chromosome breakage, which would be consistent with the apparent layers of nested retroelements. therefore, it would be conceivable that besides layered retroelements other sequences could insert within retroelements by illegitimate recombination.

here we present a few interesting examples of intact genes inserted into an ltr retrotransposon, one of which is the fie <dig> gene in the maize orp <dig> region . based on the conserved alignment of the tandem genes in the orthologous segments of sorghum and rice, and on the phylogenetic analysis showing that the two maize fie genes represent the ancestral paralogs, we can conclude that the maize fie <dig> gene itself or a copy of it must have translocated from its original orthologous position and ultimately arrived within the ji- <dig> retrotransposon. furthermore, the fie <dig> gene is expressed in a specific pattern that differs from the fie <dig> gene on the other homoeologous chromosomal region of maize. the duplication of the two fie genes resulting from wgd in the progenitor of maize possibly led to four gene copies that were disadvantageous. it appears that a large percentage of duplicated genes in the maize genome lost their second copy  <cit> . the wgd possibly increased transposition and chromosomal breakages leading to the relocation of genes. the final positioning of the fie <dig> gene within the ltr retrotransposon might have been advantageous in affecting the differential expression of the fie <dig>  interesting is that the movement of the fie <dig> gene has likely occurred over a very short distance on the same chromosome because it is located very close to its orthologous position.

another possibility for the embedded genes is that processed gene transcripts of the embedded genes were co-packaged into the viral particles allowing the integration of the gene sequence into the body of the element by jumping templates via reverse transcription during the replicative process. this is less likely the case for short distance movement because integration of the composite element is likely to occur at an unlinked location. however, the second example described here, the auxin-related genes on chromosome  <dig> could have been derived from such a mechanism. if processed transcripts were co-packaged into viral particles, one would expect that those genes would be intronless. while the fie <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> contains its introns, the auxin-related genes on chromosome  <dig> do not have introns.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we are providing here a new feature of how ltr retrotransposons are not merely parasitic in nature but have adapted to be elements in the genome that can rapidly rearrange the organization and possibly affect regulation of genes in response to the "challenge", as proposed by mcclintock in  <dig>  <cit> . as we show in this study, ltr retrotransposons contain intact gene copies that are much older than the time of the retroelement insertion within a genomic region. such genes must have existed in another location of the genome prior to the ltr insertion. the sequences containing these genes were either copied or deleted from their original  positions and then inserted into retroelements. because retroelements do not excise from their position, but are copied and inserted into new genomic positions, they also could potentially place acquired gene copies throughout the genome, causing a disruption in gene order after speciation of ancestral chromosomes. if this were to be the case, one would expect that genes carried by retrotransposition would loose their introns from reverse transcription of processed transcripts as suggested for the auxin-related genes in tbp <dig> region of maize chromosome 1l. therefore, it is possible that the frequent gene movements in grass genomes reported recently  <cit>  could be explained in part by such a mechanism. this would resemble the proposed movement of gene fragments by mutator-related dna transposable elements  <cit> . furthermore, the short lifespan of ltr retrotransposons might explain why many sequences containing non-collinear genes might have lost the sequence motifs associated with retroelements from their flanking regions. in addition, nesting of genes in ltr retrotransposons might also result in the differentiation of the expression of duplicated genes. these findings support further studies to uncover the full extent of the effect of retrotransposons on the structural and functional evolution of genes and genomes.
