BACKGROUND
cassava  is an important tropical root crop that plays an important role not only in ensuring food security, but also in various bioindustrial applications such as animal feed, modified starch and biofuels  <cit> , <cit> . because cassava is native to tropical regions, it is extremely cold-sensitive; its growth is drastically affected at temperatures lower than 18°c, and the plant cannot survive for long after exposure to freezing conditions  <cit> – <cit> . therefore, low temperatures and freezing conditions are the most important limiting factors for the cultivating location, as well as productivity. the damage of apical shoot seems be to more critical than other parts of the cassava plant  <cit> . improving the tolerability of the cassava plant to multiple stresses has therefore, become a major objective of cassava breeders, especially in subtropical regions  <cit> , <cit> . under cold conditions, up-regulation of reactive oxygen species  turnover and scavenging in cassava has been reported, and therefore, genetic manipulation of intracellular ros level might be an effective approach in improving tolerance to abiotic stresses in this tropical crop  <cit> – <cit> .

in the ros scavenging system that is responsible for homeostasis in plant cells, superoxide dismutases , enzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, provide the first line of defense against ros in various subcellular compartments, i.e. chloroplast, mitochondria and cytosol  <cit> . essentially, there are three types of sods, each containing either manganese, iron, or copper plus zinc as a prosthetic group  <cit> . along with other ros scavenging mechanisms like catalase , glutathione peroxidases  and peroxiredoxin reductases , and the ascorbate–glutathione  cycle, the ros levels are maintained in a homeostatic state. in the asc-gsh cycle, using ascorbate as an electron donor, ascorbate peroxidase  scavenges potentially harmful hydrogen peroxide to water from the chloroplasts and mitochondria, as well as other organelles  <cit> , <cit> . therefore, the formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals by superoxide and hydrogen peroxide can be controlled by the combined enzymatic actions of sod and apx  <cit> .

transgenic plants that express sod or apx have shown enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses  <cit> . for example, over-expression of different sods  in transgenic plants of tomato, rice, poplar, alfalfa, etc., showed increased tolerance to methyl viologen , ozone, high salinity, chilling or other stresses  <cit> – <cit> . transgenic plants have also demonstrated an increased tolerance against various abiotic stresses by the expression of either cytosolic- or organelle-targeted cytosolic apx  <cit> – <cit> . however, some reports suggest no change in response to oxidative or environmental stress with the expression of a single antioxidant enzyme  <cit> , <cit> . these contradictory findings may be due to the complex network of plant antioxidant defenses, which possibly confer a higher tolerance to oxidative stress by pyramiding or stacking of multiple genes in a single genotype  <cit> . the gene-stacking approach entails manipulation of two or more desirable enzymes mediating the ros turnover and scavenging pathways, in improving the abiotic stress tolerance in plants.

indeed, co-expression of two distinct ros-scavenging enzymes, such as sod and other ros-scavenging enzymes, in the chloroplasts or cytosol in transgenic plants has a synergistic effect in increasing the levels of abiotic stress resistance. for example, coupled expression of cu/znsod and apx in transgenic plants of festuca arundinacea, potato, tobacco, sweet potato and plum led to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, e.g., the herbicide methyl viologen , chilling, high temperature and drought  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . payton et al.  <cit>  showed that co-expression of glutathione reductase  and apx in cotton improved antioxidant enzyme activity during moderate chilling at high light intensity, in chloroplasts  <cit> . co-expression of the suaeda salsa glutathione s-transferase  and cat <dig> in rice also caused tolerance to stresses caused by salt and paraquat  <cit> . taken together, these data indicated that the combination of transgenes encoding different ros-scavenging enzymes in various subcellular compartments might have a synergistic effect in improving stress tolerance.

lately, plant breeders and biotechnologists have appreciated the molecular insights and advances in cassava abiotic stress resistance, on a global scale. apart from the various approaches from traditional breeding to field evaluation  <cit> , studies of cassava response to drought or cold stress at the molecular level have reportedly used the “omics” technology, e.g., expressed sequence tags, cdnas and oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> , <cit> – <cit> . however, few studies on improved tolerance to environmental stresses using genetic engineering have been reported  <cit> , <cit> . senescence-induced expression of the isopentenyl transferase gene in cassava showed increased drought resistance, as observed by the elevated content of cytokinin in mature leaves, and prolonged leaf life  <cit> . enhanced ros scavenging by simultaneous expression of cytosolic mecu/znsod and peroxisomal mecat <dig> in transgenic cassava also confirmed the improved tolerance towards drought and cold temperatures  <cit> .

in the present study, transgenic cassava plants co-expressing both cytosolic mecu/znsod  and cytosolic meapx <dig>  showed enhanced ros scavenging capacity, thereby leading to enhanced tolerance to oxidative stresses that was induced by mv, h2o <dig> as well as chilling. our results suggest that manipulation of ros-scavenging enzyme systems by the overexpression of both cytosolic sod and apx is a worthwhile approach to produce transgenic plants with enhanced tolerance to a wide range of abiotic stresses.

RESULTS
subcellular localization of mecu/znsod and meapx2
green fluorescent protein  was the fusion protein used for subcellular localization of mecu/znsod and meapx <dig>  the control, camv 35s-egfp construct, exhibited gfp fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nucleus of agroinfiltrated cells of n. benthamiana leaves. the mecu/znsod has been reported as a cytosolic sod isoform in our previous report  <cit> . the meapx <dig> was located in the cytosol of the leaf cells, as indicated by the fused gfp fluorescence  that was consistent with the signal peptide sequences predicted by reilly et al.  <cit> . therefore, both enzymes used in the study were cytosolic proteins.

molecular characterization of the transgenic plants
four independent transgenic plant lines  harboring the mecu/znsod and meapx <dig> gene-expressing cassettes  were produced by the use of agrobacterium-mediated transformation and subcultured in vitro regularly. confirmation of the single integration event of the pc-p54::mecu/znsod-35s::meapx <dig> t-dna in these transgenic lines were carried out by the southern blotting technique using xbai-digested cassava genomic dna, which were extracted from leaves of in vitro plants and hybridized with dig-labeled hpt probe . no signals were detected in the wild-type  plants. however, when these wt plants were hybridized with the meapx <dig> probe , two bands of ~13 kb and ~ <dig>  kb were detected, indicating the possibility of two apx homologs in the cassava genome. the transgenic sa lines showed an additional band in their hybridization pattern, confirming that the transgenic plants were integrated at a single site . all transgenic plants except sa <dig> line thrived successfully in the greenhouse and field, with a relatively normal leaf phenotype, growth capacity and root tuberization, similar to wt plants ; the sa <dig> line had a slightly dark-green and curled leaves when cultivated in the field. no significant differences of yield were found between wt and transgenic plant lines .

the basic transcriptional levels of mecu/znsod and meapx <dig> in cassava leaves were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  . the expressions of mecu/znsod and meapx <dig> in transgenic lines were higher by up to 20- and 5-fold, respectively, when compared to that of wt plants. sod expression level was about 5-times higher than apx <dig> in the sa lines, indicating that the p <dig> promoter is stronger than camv 35s promoter in cassava, which is in agreement with the previous report  <cit> . further, the changes in sod and apx isoenzyme activity from leaves on non-denaturing gel were also confirmed . a characteristic sod isoenzyme banding pattern was found in all cassava leaves with cu/znsod, mnsod and fesod  <cit> , but the intensity of sod bands was higher in all transgenic lines than the wts. similarly, a stronger apx isoenzyme band was also observed in all transgenic lines than that of wt . these results indicate that the heightened production of sods and apxs were achieved because of the transgene expression in transgenic cassava.

higher protoplast viability and mitochondrial integrity of mesophyll cells under h2o <dig> stress
cell death and loss of mitochondrial integrity are indicators of stress damage. the viability of extracted transgenic and wt mesophyll protoplasts was above 95%, when stained by fluorescein diacetate . after 1 m h2o <dig> treatment, the viability of transgenic protoplasts from sa <dig>  sa <dig>  and sa <dig> decreased to 77%, 74%, and 80%, respectively, but the wts showed 52% , indicating significant improvement to stress tolerance. the mitochondrial integrity of mesophyll cells were observed by rhodamine  <dig>  staining. strong rh  <dig> fluorescent signals were observed in all cassava cells prior to h2o <dig> treatment, indicating normal mitochondrial activity in these cells. after h2o <dig> treatment, the protoplasts of the wt plants displayed diffuse and much weaker fluorescent signals, but the protoplasts derived from the transgenic plants retained their intense fluorescence activity . the difference between transgenic lines and wt was evident, which indicated that the cells in transgenic plants displayed higher h2o <dig> tolerance than that in wt plants.

enhanced tolerance to h2o2-mediated oxidative stress in transgenic leaves
to evaluate the response of transgenic plants to oxidative stress, leaves showing a basal level of h2o <dig> production, as indicated by  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine  staining , were selected and treated with  <dig>  m h2o <dig>  after 24 hours, h2o <dig> molecules significantly accumulated in wt leaves  at a concentration of  <dig>  mmol/g, which was  <dig> -times higher than that in the untreated leaves . leaves of transgenic plants showed much less h2o <dig> accumulation , as observed by the elimination of the reaction product, dab-h2o <dig>  from a majority of leaves from the sa <dig> plants . for example, the h2o <dig> concentration in the leaves of sa <dig> was  <dig>  mmol/g, which was  <dig> % higher than that in the untreated leaves.

the activities of sod and apx in cassava leaves were assessed under normal and stressful conditions . enzyme activities were not significantly different between wt and transgenic plants under normal conditions. however, after stress induction, the sod activity of wt plants decreased to 20% of the baseline value in 24 hours . in contrast, the sod activity of all transgenic plant lines increased in 12 hours; for example, the activity level in sa <dig> showed a 2-fold increase as compared to 0 hours with  <dig>  u mg− <dig> protein. however, their activities decreased at 24 hours; the lowest value was observed in sa <dig> plants with  <dig>  u mg− <dig> protein, which was about 4-times higher than that of wt plants . a consistent increase in apx activity was detected in all leaves, especially in sa <dig>  with the activity level showing a 3-fold increased at 24 h as compared to 0 h; protein levels increased from  <dig>  μmol · min−1 · mg− <dig> protein to  <dig>  μmol · min−1 · mg− <dig> protein. the wt only showed an increase from  <dig>  μmol · min−1 · mg− <dig> protein to  <dig>  μmol · min−1 · mg− <dig> protein. at 24 hours, all transgenic plant leaves showed a significant increase in activity compared to the wt plant leaves .

enhanced tolerance to methyl viologen -mediated oxidative stress in transgenic leaves
the effect of methyl viologen , a superoxide-generating herbicide, on cassava was determined by subjecting the leaves to 100 μm mv for 2 days. compared to wt plants, the extent of chlorophyll loss due to mv was significantly less in transgenic leaves . as shown in figure 5b, the chlorophyll content was not significantly different between wt and transgenic plants prior to mv treatment. after mv treatment, the chlorophyll content of wt plant leaves decreased by 75%, whereas in sa <dig>  sa <dig> and sa <dig> leaves, the chlorophyll loss was only 21%, 37% and 38%, respectively. mv treatment causes membrane-lipid peroxidation, leading to an increase in the malondialdehyde  content. after mv treatment, the mda content in wt plants increased to a maximum of 45%, whereas in transgenic lines the mda content increased by approximately 14% . the average amount of mda in wt was  <dig>  nmol/g fresh weight , which had  <dig>  nmol/g fw more than sa <dig> line. these data suggests that transgenic cassava has less lipid peroxidation because of timely ros scavenging. the impact of ros scavenging enzymes in transgenic cassava was further confirmed when both sod and apx activities were significantly enhanced after treatment . the sod and apx activity was approximately  <dig> -times higher in transgenic plants as compared to wt plants. the highest activity of sod reached  <dig> u/mg protein in sa <dig> line; and the highest value of apx was found in sa <dig> line with  <dig>  μmol · min−1 · mg− <dig> protein. these data confirmed that improved performance of transgenic cassava leaves against oxidative stress is due to elevated sod and apx activities of the ros scavenging system.

improved cold tolerance of transgenic plants
two-month-old plants were given a chilling treatment by transferring into a growth chamber at 4°c for 2 days. after the treatment, the wt plants wilted severely, whereas the transgenic lines were slightly affected, with fewer leaves wilting . among the three transgenic cassava lines, the sa <dig> line was the least affected by the chilling treatment. the level of mda increased by 7%, 8%, and 20% in sa <dig>  sa <dig>  and sa <dig> lines after chilling stress, respectively. however, wt showed a 40% increase in mda content, which was significantly higher than that of transgenic lines .

other ros-scavenging enzymes were monitored in both wt and sa transgenic cassava for their response to cold stress. before treatment, both the wt and all the transgenic lines showed similar level of enzymatic activity. upon cold treatment, increased activity of sod, cat, apx, mdhar, dhar and gr were confirmed in the transgenic lines as compared to the wt plants . the apx activity in sa lines showed >2-fold increase than wt . the increase in sod and cat activities in transgenic lines was about  <dig> -fold that of wt after treatment . in the ascorbate cycle, mdhar, dhar and gr increased up to  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . however, no significant changes in enzyme activity were observed in wt before and after the treatment.

discussion
the cassava plant is generally considered to be cold-sensitive, and abiotic stresses, such as low temperature and salinity, dramatically affect their growth, thereby, leading to reduced productivity  <cit> , <cit> . excessive ros generation, which might result in hypersensitive response and cell death in cassava, has been identified as an important indicator of such conditions  <cit> , <cit> . therefore, maintaining ros homeostasis via ros production and scavenging mechanisms is critical  <cit> , <cit> . optimum regulation of ros generation and scavenging by the mobilization of various pathways has been proposed as a vital mechanism for managing stress in cassava  <cit> , <cit> , and our previous study had confirmed that increased resistance to abiotic stress could be achieved in transgenic cassava by over-expression of cytosolic cu/znsod and peroxisomal cat <dig>  <cit> , <cit> . in this study, we showed that transgenic cassava with coupled expression of cytosolic mecu/znsod and cytosolic meapx <dig> leads to improved oxidative and chilling stress resistance through elevated ros scavenging. our studies confirmed that the response to abiotic stress can be improved in cassava by genetic engineering techniques that combine two different ros-scavenging pathways, i.e., sod/cat and sod/asc-gsh cycle.

most of ros scavenging enzymes co-expressed targeted the chloroplast  <cit> – <cit> . recently, faize et al.  <cit>  and diaz-vivancos et al.  <cit>  reported that over-expression of cytosolic sod and apx in tobacco and plums improved drought and salt tolerance. an interesting question raised is the effectiveness of the stacked ros-scavenging enzymes with various subcellular targeting strategies in plants, undoubtedly their individual important function in stress defense  <cit> , <cit> . since the substrate for apx activity is h2o <dig> that is a by-product of sod action, their individual functions should be combined to achieve a synergistic effect on stress tolerance. indeed, upon chilling, the enzymatic activity of mdhar, dhar and gr in the asc-gsh cycle in the transgenic cassava was significantly increased . we noticed that, comparing to the transgenic cassava overexpressed cytosolic sod and peroxisomal cat  <cit> , the sa transgenic cassava showed less tolerance to post-harvest physiological deterioration of their storage roots . we suppose that the ppd occurrence in cassava storage root is directly linked to the oxidization process in the subcellular organelles of parenchyma cells; the action of in the peroxisome enables the timely scavenging of excess ros generated in situ.

both h2o <dig> and mv treatment in the presence of light lead to the generation of superoxide radicals and h2o <dig> in chloroplasts and mitochondria of plants. in vivo imaging of ros using the fluorescent probe rhodamine- <dig>  a stain readily sequestered by active mitochondria and mesophyll protoplasts, or dab staining of cassava leaves showed improved tolerance of transgenic cassava cells to oxidative stress caused by h2o <dig> and mv . at the cellular level, the viability of the mesophyll protoplast and integrity of the mitochondrial were clearly indicated by their tolerance to h2o <dig> in transgenic cassava cells . these results indicate that transgenic plants expressing both cytosolic sod and cytosolic apx are able to rapidly scavenge superoxide and hydrogen peroxide at the site of generation, as well as prevent the formation of hydroxyl radicals, the most toxic ros, prior to their interaction with target molecules, as noted in our previous report  <cit> . the changes were observed not only in cytosolic antioxidant system but also in the chloroplasts and mitochondria, which implied that changes in the cytosolic antioxidant defense impacts the subcellular compartments, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . therefore, ros scavenging system in plant cells is an integrative network for developing an antioxidant machinery through cytosol and subcellular organelle interactions.

under cold conditions, non-transformed cassava plants showed signs of oxidative stress-induced cellular damage such as wilting, and increased lipid peroxidation of leaves . cassava is very sensitive to low temperature; cold temperatures disrupt the metabolic balance of plant cells, resulting in enhanced production of ros, e.g. h2o <dig> <cit> . the timely detoxification of ros is necessary for the maintenance of the calvin cycle and transpiration  <cit> . transcriptome profiling of low temperature-exposed cassava showed an increase in transcripts and enzyme activities of ros scavenging genes and the accumulation of total soluble sugars  <cit> . in the sa transgenic lines, we confirmed that the enzyme activity of sod and apx were significantly higher than that of wt during cold treatment . increased catalytic activity of apx eliminated the endogenous h2o <dig> via the asc-gsh cycle, which involves gr, dhar and mdhar, to restore the cellular redox state, thus, suggesting that the performance of ascorbate-glutathione cycle is essential for the regulation of an efficient system for scavenging the accumulated ros in leaves during chilling stress. this response was correlated with the up-regulation of apx activity and by maintenance of asc-gsh redox pools in cold-acclimated plants  <cit> .

a higher cat activity was also observed in the sa lines under stress conditions. this increase seemed to be involved in the removal of excess h2o <dig>  dong et al.  <cit>  reported that peroxisomal metabolism responded to cold regulation through ros by increasing the h2o <dig> production in the peroxisome  <cit> . h2o <dig> could also diffuse through the peroxisomal membrane into the cytosol  <cit> , thus increasing the risk of oxidative damage in this compartment. it suggests that ros scavenging system in cassava is a complex network involving multiple components of ros production, turnover and scavenging as well as their cross-interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results show the important role of cytosolic mecu/znsod and cytosolic meapx <dig> in cassava in improving ros scavenging, thereby leading to reduced h2o <dig> accumulation and improved abiotic stress resistance. the results also confirm that the transgenic approach is effective in improving the stress resistance in cassava via proper gene stacking of ros scavenging enzymes.
