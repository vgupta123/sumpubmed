BACKGROUND
the availability of a massive amount of sequence data stimulated in-depth analyses on the organization of bacterial genomes  <cit> . although less prominent than in eukaryotic genomes, sequence repeats are found in most bacterial species. according to their sizes, sequence repeats may be roughly classified into two main classes. large repeats  are mostly insertion sequences , and encode proteins mediating their genomic mobility. the terminal inverted repeats  and the nature of their gene products allow sorting iss into specific classes  <cit> . smaller repeats  make up a much less defined and more variegate set of genomic sequences. some of them contain palindromic sequences, demonstrated or proposed to be structured as stem-loops able to function as regulatory elements at dna or rna level. for example, e. coli pu-bime elements have been shown to interact with the dna gyrase  <cit>  and the integration host factor protein  <cit> , but also to function as mrna stabilizers  <cit>  and transcriptional attenuators  <cit> . similarly, palindromic sequence repeats have been shown to function as mrna stability determinants in neisseriae  <cit>  and yersiniae  <cit> .

following these observations, and given the current availability of a large number of sequenced bacterial genomes, a systematic analysis of stem-loop containing repeated sequences appeared of interest. in a previous article  <cit> , high stability stem-loop structures  were studied within a representative set of bacterial genomes and some of them were shown to have strong similarity with each other. here we extend this study to detect all families of sls containing sequences in the same bacterial set. to this aim, a pipeline, combining sequence clustering and hidden markov model  based searches, was developed. this strategy led to the definition of a large number of sequence families, sharing sequence similarity and, in most cases, a common predicted secondary structure.

RESULTS
identification of initial sls clusters
in a previous work a large number of sls containing sequences were identified within  <dig> bacterial genomes  <cit> . for each bacterial species, sequences obtained from this study and predicted to fold with a free energy lower than - <dig> kcal/mol were selected. in order to avoid obvious structured repeated sequences, they were filtered to eliminate those falling within either mature rna species  or known iss. an all-against-all blast comparison was performed on the selected sequences for the creation of a distance matrix, where distance is reported as the e-value of the found matches. since slss are strand-specific, blast was run without searching for the complementary strand. links between overlapping sequences were cut, by eliminating the corresponding matches from the matrix. the resulting matrix was then fed to a markov clustering algorithm  based tool  <cit>  to produce a set of clusters. this clustering step was performed by using stringent parameters  in order to favour the selection of more homogeneous clusters.

to avoid repeated analyses on the same genomic sequence, overlapping clustered slss were subsequently joined into larger sls containing regions . clusters composed of at least  <dig> scrs were selected and are reported in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> analyzed genomes,  <dig> contain at least one cluster. the procedure led to the identification of  <dig> clusters, which together contain  <dig>  elements, corresponding to  <dig>  non-overlapping scrs. no clusters were identified for the remaining  <dig> genomes: l. innocua, l. monocytogenes, s. pyogenes, c. pneumoniae, c. trachomatis, u. urealyticum, r. prowazekii, t. pallidum, buchnera, c. jejuni and h. pylori.

blast-mcl clustering of slss identified, from a representative set of bacterial genomes, as described in petrillo et al.  <cit> : only species with at least one cluster of a minimum of  <dig> elements are listed. for each species, the number of elements within the starting population, the number of clusters and the number of clustered slss are reported. the number of sls containing regions , obtained by fusing overlapping clustered slss, is also reported.

the clusters identified in each positive genome range between  <dig> and  <dig>  for a total of  <dig> to over  <dig>  clustered scrs per genome. all together they correspond to about  <dig> % of the originally selected population of over  <dig> million sequences. in order to evaluate the quality of the described clustering procedure, grouped scrs were aligned by using the pcma multiple alignment tool  <cit> , and the resulting alignments were evaluated by alistat  <cit> . over 80% of the clusters showed an average identity better than 60%. the established consensus was larger than  <dig> bp for the about half of them, while the others produced consensus sequences between  <dig> and  <dig> bp .

clustered sls containing sequences show high ability to form a stable secondary structure
the ability to fold into a reliable secondary structure was analyzed by using randfold  <cit> , which compares the predicted minimum folding energy  of a sequence with those of a large number of random shuffles of the same sequence. results are expressed as a p-value, representing the probability of the predicted mfe being truly different from the others. in this test, sequences were shuffled by preserving dinucleotide frequencies, as proposed by workman and krogh  <cit> .

for each genome, the test was performed on clustered slss, as well as on slss randomly picked from the initial population and random sequences of equal size extracted from the same genome. the results are reported in figure  <dig>  where sequences are assigned to specific "folding aptitude" classes, according to the p-value calculated by randfold. most clustered sequences  show a non-random probability of folding below  <dig>  , and, very often, also below  <dig>  , whereas only about 20% of the original sls population reach these p-values . only for m. leprae, l. johnsonii, m. genitalium and m. pneumoniae, the two sls populations do not show statistically different folding aptitudes. a very small fraction  of control sequences showed a non-random folding probability higher than  <dig> % .

evaluation and refinement of the initial clustering
various grouping procedures were used to combine the initial  <dig> clusters, according to sequence similarity, strand reciprocity and position on the genome. the results are reported in table  <dig> 

clusters reported in table  <dig> were regrouped, according to sequence similarity, strand reciprocity and relative genomic position of their elements, as described in methods. the number of groups, obtained by each criterion, is reported in the three columns labelled "grouped by". several groups are composed of sequences, contained within iss or rrna genes; their number is shown in the last two columns, for each genome.

in order to group clusters sharing sequence similarity, the clustered scrs were re-clustered by using the above described blast-mcl based procedure, under less stringent conditions. the initial  <dig> clusters could be associated into  <dig> new clusters, most of them characterized by a larger number of elements . within each new cluster, overlapping scrs were fused as described above.

the ability to form sls is generally shared by the two complementary strands of a given dna sequence, the only exception being sequences where gu pairing is essential to form a stem-loop satisfying the minimum requirements. a number of clusters should therefore be composed of elements from the opposite strands of the same genomic region. such clusters were identified, again by using the blast-mcl procedure, this time allowing blast searches also on the complementary strand. about two thirds of the clusters could be paired in this way, thus reducing the total number to  <dig> 'unrelated' clusters .

a third refinement was directed to connect clusters, which might represent different parts of a larger dna repeat. for this reason, paired clusters, whose elements resulted to be overlapping or located at short distance , were identified and joined within one group. this led to a further reduction to  <dig> cluster groups .

the resulting set was pruned by comparing scrs from each cluster against the is sequences collected in the isfinder database  <cit>  by using blast, in order to remove insertion sequences, possibly missed in the initial filtering. similarly rrna- and trna-related clusters were removed by evaluating the genomic localization of their elements, relative to genes encoding stable rnas. these tests revealed that  <dig> cluster groups were related to insertion sequences, mainly not known at the time of the initial filtering, and  <dig> cluster groups were composed of sequence elements contained within rrna precursors. these  <dig> cluster groups, reported in the columns 'is' and 'rrna' of table  <dig>  were flagged and not used for further analysis.

the whole procedure above described led to the identification of  <dig> candidate sls-containing repeated dna families.

characterization of families expanded by hidden markov model searches
the candidate families were identified starting from small sls containing sequences, which may be contained within regions of sequence similarity larger than the originally detected ones. in addition, genomic sequences may exist which, although similar, do not contain a sls able to match the threshold used in the original search. for these reasons, a combined iterative procedure, based on hmm genome searches, was developed and applied to each family. in the procedure, a hmm built on the alignment of all family members is used to scan the parental genome and the detected sequences are aligned to the model. alignments are extended by attaching neighboring sequences in order to define larger models, when possible. multiple cycles of alignment, elongation, model building and genome search were performed until the borders of the repeated sequence were reached .

a final, manual refinement was performed to combine essentially identical models. at the end of this procedure  <dig> models were obtained, which define the families reported in table  <dig>  where the length of the model and the number of detected sequences, both covering the entire model or part of it, are indicated.  <dig> models range in size between  <dig> and  <dig> bp, while the rest are larger, but only two extend over  <dig> kb.

the final set of  <dig> families of repeated sequences is reported, grouped by species. for each family, the length of the model and the number of sequences fitting the model are given. the number of complete sequences, i.e. covering the model from end to end, is reported in parenthesis. previously described sequence families have been named in column "family", according to the current literature; for each of them, the number and typical size of its members are also provided, together with references. for novel families, a systematic name was built by fusing a shortened species name to a progressive number. in the column "type", i, g and s indicate the prevalent genomic location of the members of each families within intergenic, genic or border-spanning sequences. for some families, small previously described sequence motifs contribute to the formation of a substantially larger model; for others, their members are frequently located within larger previously described sequences. in both cases, a note is reported in the rightmost column.

blast comparison of all family elements, against the consensus sequences for dna repeats described in literature, revealed that  <dig> families are already known, corresponding to essentially all previously identified sls containing families. for each of them, size and copy number are reported in table  <dig>  along with the corresponding values derived from literature data  <cit> .

the remaining  <dig> families are not described as such in literature. their sizes range from  <dig> to over  <dig>  bp for a number of elements varying between  <dig> and  <dig>  nine of these families  contain known dna sequence motifs, such as crispr  <cit> , miru  <cit>  and dus  <cit> : the combination of two or more specific elements, matching these motifs, generates larger, sls containing repeated sequences, not previously described. sixteen families are made up of sequences contained within larger sequence blocks, either coding for abundant protein motifs or located within larger, ill-defined redundant intergenic sequences. forty-two families appear to be unrelated to previously described sequence elements.

secondary structure analyses
three different approaches were used to evaluate the aptitude of sequences from the detected families to fold into a common secondary structure :

the ability to form a consensus secondary structure was evaluated by rnaz: the prediction scores are reported in column "p" for each family. the type of predicted structure is indicated in column "conserved structure", where "s" indicates a stem-loop based structure, while "c" indicates a more complex structure, where a stem-loop compatible with the original search is not present. for each family, the aligned localization of the original slss is indicated by '+' in column "conserved sls position"; when sls alignment is not in agreement with the rnaz prediction, a '°' is added to the '+' symbol. the column marked "sls folding aptitude" reports the behavior of family elements in the randfold test: the number of '+' symbols describes the percent of positive elements . the localization of family members, as already described in table  <dig>  is also reported in the last column.

1) ability to form conserved secondary structures, evaluated, for each family, by rnaz  <cit>  analysis of the alignment of six representative sequences to the family hmm ;

2) presence of aligned slss and agreement with the structure predicted by rnaz ;

3) probability of non-random folding for slss contained within each family, calculated by using randfold  <cit>  .

only families with either a predicted conserved secondary structure or aligned slss are reported. of the  <dig> described families,  <dig> generate a common secondary structure, when analyzed by rnaz. for most  of them, marked as "s", the predicted structure contains a stem-loop compatible with the original search. in all but cod- <dig>  the position of the originally found slss is in agreement with the structure predicted by rnaz. these slss tend to be positive also to the randfold test: in  <dig> of the  <dig> families, most members contain slss, able to fold into a non-random secondary structure . for ten of the  <dig> families, indicated by "c", a more complex common structure is predicted by rnaz, not including a stem-loop compatible with the original search. most of them, accordingly, do not feature aligned slss. yet, the presence of aligned slss in three families  may be seen as an indication for sls-containing alternative folding.

rnaz failed to predict a common structure for  <dig> of the  <dig> families: for most of these families  no aligned slss are available, indicating the absence of common secondary structures. aligned slss are present in  <dig> families , which score negative at the rnaz test: for all but rpe- <dig>  aligned slss show a low folding aptitude .

genomic localization
genomic localization of the families is reported in table  <dig> where, in column "type", families are classified, according to the position of the vast majority of their members, relative to annotated coding sequences.  <dig> families are intergenic ,  <dig> genic  and  <dig> tend to span the borders between coding and non coding sequences, and are therefore indicated as border spanning .

for  <dig> families no clear predominance of genic or intergenic sequences was observed, and therefore the family was not assigned to a class.

genomic localization of the families predicted to fold in a secondary structure is reported in table 4; for all families, genomic localization, correlated with the predicted ability of the family members to fold into a common, stable secondary structure, is summarized in table  <dig>  for most intergenic families a secondary structure is predicted . genic families, in contrast, are predominantly not structured: only about one third  have a structure predicted by rnaz and only for  <dig> of them aligned slss support its existence. border spanning and unclassified sequence families feature a predicted secondary structure with frequencies similar to intergenic ones.

columns under "sec. struct. +/-" report the number of families, characterized by the presence or absence of a conserved secondary structure predicted by rnaz; the labels "sls +/-" indicate the presence or absence of aligned slss; "total" means the sum of rows or columns.

characterization of specific families
the described procedure led to the identification of a large number of families of repeated bacterial sequences, some already known, other previously undescribed. for many of them, a number of tests showed the potential folding of the majority of their members into a shared secondary structure. four such families are reported in figure  <dig>  where the predicted secondary structure is shown along with the aligned, originally found, slss. one of them, the eric family from e. coli, had previously been described, while the other three are new. eric, as anticipated from literature reports  <cit> , is predicted to fold into a single, long stem-loop structure. sta- <dig> folds into a simple, shorter sls. pae- <dig> and efa- <dig> families feature more complex structures, composed of a pair of adjacent slss. the structures predicted for these four families may be predicted on both strands, with complementary sequences generally, but not necessarily, folding into corresponding stems. for pae- <dig>  the prediction of different structures on the two strands indicates the likely presence of multiple foldings of comparable stability, which, on each strand, are alternatively selected as the best one, because of minor base pair differences.

for some of the identified families, secondary structure predictions, although supported by high rnaz scores, are not consistent with the originally found slss. generally this stems from the prediction, by rnaz, of structures not including slss fitting with the original sls definition. pu-bime and drs <dig>  shown in figure  <dig>  are examples of such families: in pu-bime the stem includes a five base internal loop, while in drs <dig> the  <dig> bp stem is too short. both cases are not compatible with the original search .

finally, for about one third of the  <dig> identified families, it is unlikely that a rna secondary structure may play a relevant role, as shown by the absence of either a common predicted structure or alignment of originally found slss. an example of such families is myt- <dig>  reported in figure  <dig> 

discussion
in a previous study, a systematic analysis of putative slss found in bacterial genomes showed that they tend to be more abundant and stable than those randomly formed in shuffled sequences of comparable size and base composition  <cit> . this observation led to the hypothesis that, along with slss stochastically formed because of sequence composition, a sizeable quota is possibly the result of selective pressure, due to the need to preserve a biological function. sls-containing secondary structures are known to play a relevant role in several aspects of gene expression and its regulation. structured rnas are a functional component of enzymes like rnase p  <cit> , or contribute to the formation of regulatory cis-acting regions such as riboswitches  <cit> , thermosensors  <cit> , transcriptional attenuators and terminators  <cit> . palindromic rna sequence repeats may also influence mrna stability  <cit> .

in this work, we describe a systematic procedure, schematically depicted in figure  <dig>  to identify and classify families of repeated sequences, characterized by a shared secondary structure, in the genomes of a representative set of bacteria, most of which of medical interest. to this aim, sls containing sequences were first clustered by sequence similarity and subsequently evaluated for their potential to form secondary structures. in most analyzed genomes, a fraction of slss could be grouped into clusters, containing at least  <dig> non-overlapping elements. no clusters were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> analyzed genomes.

clustering by sequence similarity resulted in selection of  <dig> clusters corresponding to just above  <dig>  slss, about 1% of the whole sls population: this figure may vary quite a lot in specific species, being sensibly larger, up to 6%, in n. meningitidis, and substantially lower in b. subtilis and p. multocida, where less than  <dig> % of the slss fall within clusters. clustering ended up by selecting a subset of slss different from the original population and characterized by a much higher probability of non-random folding , indicating that selection based on sequence similarity was very effective in enriching for structured regions.

various refinement steps produced the final set of  <dig> clusters, reported in table  <dig>  although mature rrna and trna genes were initially masked within the searched genomic sequences, some clusters were identified, which correspond to unmasked parts of ribosomal rna precursor genes . similarly, some clusters correspond to slss contained within iss, which escaped the initial filtering for various reasons. removal of these two subsets and other redundancies reduced the number of identified families to  <dig> 

notwithstanding the starting population of sls containing sequences, within these families regions sharing primary structure similarity, but not a common sls, might, in principle, still be found, and  <dig> families with no recognizable shared secondary structure, were indeed identified. most of these sequences are, not surprisingly, found within coding regions, where the formation of secondary structures is expected to be limited by the translation machinery. however, some of these families coincide with intergenic sequence repeats, such as the s. pneumoniae box and p. putida rep sequences unable to form structures compatible with the originally searched ones.

families sharing common secondary structures
most identified families,  <dig> out of  <dig>  are predicted by rnaz to share a common secondary structure. this group includes well-known intergenic families, such as the e. coli pu-bime and eric repeats, and their homologues in other species, as well as a number of less known families, most of which described in isolated reports, but not characterized in detail . practically all intergenic repeats, previously shown or predicted to fold into a rna secondary structure, have been found. the only exceptions are the s. pneumoniae rup and the r. conorii rpe- <dig> repeats, which, although identified by the pipeline, do not fall into this group, because rnaz could not predict a shared secondary structure better than the defined threshold.

for known families, the sequence boundaries, as predicted by the pipeline, are essentially coincident with those previously reported in literature. specific discrepancies were found only in two families. in the n. meningitidis nemis elements, the present search identified the central  <dig> bp core, but failed to extend the similarity to either the partial  <dig> or the complete  <dig> bp repeats described by mazzone et al.  <cit> . similarly, for the s. pneumoniae rup family, only  <dig> bases were detected out of the complete  <dig> bp elements  <cit> .

known and novel families
in well characterized genomes, such as those of enterobacteria, practically all known families have been detected, along with a few new ones. in e. coli, the known pu-bime, eric and boxc families were recognized and feature shared secondary structures, while the only new one identified, the eco- <dig> family, is predicted as unable to fold. pu-bime repeats were also detected in s. typhi as two related variants  and in s. typhimurium, along with two novel families, sal- <dig> and sal- <dig> . for both of them rnaz could predict a shared secondary structure of the complex type.

as expected, eric sequences were detected not only in e. coli, but also in y. pestis and v. cholerae  <cit> : y. pestis repeats are predicted to fold with a structure closely similar to the e. coli elements. in contrast, eric sequences detected in v. cholerae are not predicted to fold, being  <dig> bp shorter than both e. coli and y. pestis homologues, because of selective erosion of their tirs. yersiniae eric sequences have been shown to regulate the level of expression of neighboring genes by folding into rna harpins  <cit> . v. cholerae eric, being unable to fold, may thus not function as rna stability determinants.

most potentially structured new families have been found in species less analyzed experimentally or whose genome was more recently sequenced, such as pseudomonaceae, bordetellae, mycobacteria.

for both novel and known families, the predicted common secondary structure is often a stem-loop . in a fraction of cases, however, rnaz analysis proposes different structures. some families feature a double hairpin  and others feature a complex structure containing a sls .

genomic localization
genomic localization highlights the preferential tendency of repeated sequences with a predicted common secondary structure to lie within intergenic regions; this is true for both known and novel ones. in contrast, families found within coding sequences  of genomes are often not structured. this is in agreement with the results of randfold analysis: most  intergenic families with aligned slss  are enriched in highly structured slss, while this is true for only one genic family, myp- <dig>  these observations support the overall hypothesis that many of these sequence families fold in a secondary structure at the rna level, particularly those located in intergenic regions, where the translation machinery is not expected to interfere with secondary structure formation.

three novel intergenic structured families, hin- <dig> in h. influenzae, nem- <dig> in n. meningitidis and pam- <dig> in p. multocida are composed of similar sequences, characterized by the repetition of short, abundant oligonucleotides, known as dus  <cit> . the recurrence, at specific short distances, of this basic oligonucleotide module, shorter than the searched pattern, produces a conserved sls larger than the required threshold. it is possible that these sequences function as transcriptional terminators, and it has been recently reported that terminator hairpins are indeed frequently formed by closely spaced, complementary instances of exogenous dna uptake signal sequences  <cit> .

some novel structured families are located within cdss. they often contain repetitive motifs of one or a few coding regions, such as lac- <dig> in l. johnsonii, pae- <dig> in p. aeruginosa and efa- <dig> in e. faecalis. interestingly, the cod- <dig> family defines a very small repeat, found within various cdss, encoding different peptides in different frames. cod- <dig> repeats resemble repetitive sequence elements found by claverie and coworkers in protein coding genes of r. conorii  <cit> . five genic families found in m. pneumoniae are part of large , possibly mobile repeated dna sequences having coding capacity  <cit> .

about one third of the identified families are found to be "unstructured". these sequences were not the object of the original search; a possible explanation of their detection is the incidental presence of slss within large repeated sequences. most such families fall within cdss . ten of them are contributed by only two genomes: m. tuberculosis and m. pneumoniae. other unstructured families are clustered within the same cds  or are dispersed within multiple cdss, sharing a common protein domain .

CONCLUSIONS
a systematic analysis of  <dig> bacterial genomes is presented, aimed to identify repeated sequence families, sharing a common predicted secondary structure. this procedure identified practically all already described families meeting these constraints, as well as a larger number of novel, undescribed nucleic acid repeats.

about two thirds of the families shared a predicted conserved secondary structure, often a stem-loop based one. interestingly, these families are mostly composed by elements located within intergenic regions. this localization reflects the hypothesis that rna folding, within these regions, is more likely to occur, not being affected by the translation machinery.

the identification of repetitive sequence families, able to fold into secondary structures and preferentially located within intergenic regions, reinforces the notion that also in prokaryotic genomes, typically more compact than eukaryotic ones, a relatively large fraction, not coding for proteins, is likely to play a biological role, by encoding functional rnas.
