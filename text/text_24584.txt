BACKGROUND
bacteria-host interactions are modulated by cell surface structures such as capsules and other extracellular polysaccharides . these polymers are generally considered to have a protective role against adverse environmental conditions  <cit> . surface polysaccharides also play a role in recognition, and thus contribute to evading the host immune system by both pathogenic and commensal bacteria. the eps from lactobacillus rhamnosus rw-9595 m stimulates interleukin, tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma in mouse splenocytes  <cit> , thus demonstrating a role in immunomodulation. many strains of l. rhamnosus produce exopolysaccharides, but production levels vary greatly among strains. strain rw-9595 m has shown the highest level of eps production for a lactic acid bacterial species at 2000 mg/l under controlled ph conditions while strain atcc  <dig> produces a low level of eps   <cit> .

polysaccharides secreted by gram positive bacteria are synthesized by either a processive or a non-processive mechanism  <cit> . the wzy-dependent non-processive mechanism requires the coordinated action of intracellular and membrane proteins with extracellular domains  <cit> . inside the cell, glycosyltransferases use sugar nucleotides as substrates in order to assemble individual repeating units linked to a lipid carrier such as undecaprenyl-phosphate. when complete, each repeating unit is then transferred to the outer surface of the membrane, where the repeating units are assembled by a wzy-dependent polymerization complex  <cit> . these polymers can then be covalently linked to the cell surface as capsules  in streptococci and staphylococci or released as exopolysaccharides  by lactic acid bacteria such as lactococci, streptococci or lactobacilli  <cit> .

as components of the wzy-dependent mechanism, the proteins proposed to be involved in determining the chain length of surface polysaccharides include a protein tyrosine phosphatase  and a polysaccharide co-polymerase  consisting of two domains, a cytosolic protein tyrosine kinase domain  and a tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane activator or modulator   <cit> . polysaccharide co-polymerases have been classified into four subfamilies according to their sequence features  <cit> . the two domains are found in a single protein in gram negative bacteria , while they are coded by two separate proteins in gram positive bacteria . in streptococcus pneumoniae, three proteins with homologous functions named cpsb , cpsc  and cpsd  have been proposed to have roles in cps polymerization and attachment  <cit> . functional studies in s. pneumoniae have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cpsd have an impact on cps production  <cit> . a stable complex consisting of cpsb, cpsc, cpsd and atp is proposed to enhance capsule synthesis in s. pneumoniae strain d <dig>  <cit> . the level of phosphorylated cpsd  is positively correlated with capsule amount in strain d <dig>  <cit>  and attachment of cps to the cell wall is proposed to be enhanced by phosphorylated cpsd  <cit> . in this model, the transphosphorylation of the cpsd  requires the presence of the cpsc  and dephosphorylation of cpsd is carried out by the phosphatase cpsb , which can also inhibit the phosphorylation of cpsd. in addition to the role of facilitating cpsd phosphorylation, morona et al.  <cit>  have proposed that cpsc is also involved in attachment of cps to the cell wall. similar systems have been proposed for eps elongation by lactococcus lactis  <cit>  and s. thermophilus  <cit> . recent data suggests that the tkm/ptk complex plays a role in coordinating with cell wall growth by spatial regulation of capsule synthesis at the division septum in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . furthermore, analogous chain length regulator protein wzz is proposed to aid the wzy polymerase by maintaining the nascent polysaccharide chain in a conformation conducive to continuing polymerization for o-antigen assembly  <cit> .

the function of the complete polymerization complex and the precise role of each protein are not yet clearly understood, and may in fact differ among strains and species. when comparing the amino acid sequences between strains rw-9595 m and atcc  <dig>  the wzd tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane modulator  and wzb phosphatase  are 100% identical, whereas the wze kinase  of the two strains differ by one amino acid   <cit> . our previous work has shown the phosphatase activity of wzb from l. rhamnosus  <cit> . in the present study, the purification of the three proteins  is described and their interactions are demonstrated in vitro. the impact of each tyrosine on the phosphorylation state of wzd is revealed in vivo using point mutations and expressing these proteins in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig>  this work shows tyrosine phosphorylation of the wzd modulator protein from l. rhamnosus and the impact of this phosphorylation on its interaction with the tyrosine protein kinase wze.

l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> was used as host strain for the wzy-dependent polymerization complex from l. rhamnosus rw-9595 m. a total of ten plasmids were constructed for expressing wze and wzb in conjunction with the wild type or nine mutated versions of the wzd gene in l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> . first, the two genes wze and wzb were amplified with primers wzerxbai/wzef-wzb and wzbr-wze/wzbfaatii for the first pcr, and two amplicons were combined by pcr using wzerxbai as reverse primer and wzbfaatii as forward primer. the combined gene amplicon was cloned into pmg36ct to form pmg36eb. nine separate tyrosine mutations to phenylalanine in the nucleotide sequence of wzd from rw-9595 m were constructed by gene synthesis . each Δwzd gene was amplified and then cloned into pmg36eb  and the resulting recombinant plasmids were separately transformed in l. lactis using the previously-published electroporation procedure  <cit> . the inserts of all final constructs in each host strain were confirmed by sequencing with an abi prism  <dig> apparatus.

production and purification of native and fusion proteins
an overnight e. coli culture was diluted 100-fold with fresh lb broth supplemented with ampicillin, which was incubated at 37°c with shaking until a <dig> reached  <dig>  to  <dig>  . induction was initiated by adding iptg to 1 mm and incubation continued for 3 h with shaking at 37°c. cells were centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 20 min at 4°c and the pellet was suspended in 15 ml ste buffer  containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme. after 10 min incubation on ice, the cells were sonicated  and then centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 20 min at 4°c  <cit> . the cell pellet was suspended in 2 ml st buffer  containing 10% sarcosyl and incubated overnight at 4°c  <cit> . the resulting suspensions of proteins were diluted  <dig> times with pbs . the 20 ml suspension of his6-wzd was added to 1 ml ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid  agarose resin  with 20 mm imidazole. batch binding was carried out overnight  with gentle stirring at 4°c. for gst-wze, glutathione sepharose 4b  was utilized for purification. when needed to ensure complete dephosphorylation, a  <dig>  ml aliquot of resin-bound his6-wzd was treated with  <dig> u yop  at 30°c for 3 h, then inactivated by heat . yop-treated and untreated aliquots  were then transferred to columns and washed  <dig> times with pbs containing 20 mm imidazole.

for proteins without any tag , the cell pellet from 100 ml of induced culture was suspended in 15 ml pbs  then incubated for 20 minutes at 25°c with 200 μg/ml lysozyme. lysis was completed by two passages on a french press  followed by centrifugation at  <dig> x g 15 min, then the pellet was washed three times with pbs containing 5% triton x- <dig> and 2 m urea, followed by two washes with pbs. the washed pellet was suspended in 5 ml pbs containing 2% sarcosyl then proteins were precipitated by adding  <dig>  ml acetone followed by centrifugation for 30 min at  <dig> x g. sarcosyl was eliminated by two washes with  <dig>  ml 70% ethanol then the pellet was suspended in 1 ml pbs containing 5 mm mgcl <dig> and 1 mm dtt.

a volume of 15 ml of l. lactis subsp. cremoris cells grown to  <dig> × 108 cfu/ml  in gm <dig> was centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 10 min at 4°c. the pellet was suspended in 1 ml te buffer  and  <dig>  mm edta) and mechanically disrupted in a mini beadbeater  with 1 g of  <dig>  mm dia. glass beads  by two 30 s treatments with 1 min cooling on ice between two treatments  <cit> . twenty microliters of cell extract was separated by sds-page.

protein-protein interaction assay
the in vitro protein interaction was carried out by his-pull down assay. either 1 ml of purified wze or 10 ml of diluted cell lysate of gst-wze with 20 mm imidazole were added to an aliquot  of the resin-conjugated his6-wzd and incubated overnight  with stirring at 4°c. in duplicate samples, 10 mm atp  was added before the overnight incubation. the protein mixtures were then transferred to a column and washed with pbs containing 20 mm imidazole. in duplicate wash solutions, either 200 μm or 10 mm atp was added. when necessary, elution of bound proteins was carried out with 1 m imidazole.

western immunoblotting
proteins separated by sds-page were transferred by semi-dry electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in triplicate to detect proteins with three different antibodies. phosphotyrosine protein detection was carried out with primary antibodies: the membrane blots were incubated overnight at 4°c using a 1: <dig> dilution of mouse monoclonal igg anti-phosphotyrosine 4g <dig> antibody . detection of tagged protein with his <dig> or gst was carried out with primary antibodies using a 1: <dig> dilution of mouse monoclonal igg2ak anti-histidine tagged antibody  or mouse monoclonal igg anti-gst tag antibody , respectively. all membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1: <dig> dilution of secondary antibody  coupled with horseradish peroxidase  . supersignal substrate  was used for hrp detection and visualised by exposure to amersham hyperfilm ecl .

RESULTS
polymerization must be strictly controlled with respect to precursor availability and the energy necessary to form glycosidic bonds as well as to transport the units out of the cell, and finally to attach the polymers to the cell in the form of capsular material or to release them. significant advancement has been made in understanding some interactions among components of the biosynthetic complex, but further work is needed to elucidate how these interactions promote the assembly of polysaccharides on the cell surface. in l. rhamnosus, three proteins may play a role in the control of eps production, namely wzb , wzd  and wze . details of comparative sequence analysis of wzb, wzd and wze can be found in the additional file  <dig> . in this study, the three genes from l. rhamnosus strain rw-9595 m were transferred to l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> in order to discover the phosphorylation state of the three proteins in vivo in a gram-positive expression system, as well as to demonstrate the importance of individual tyrosine residues to total wzd phosphorylation and to the phosphorylation state of wze. in order to examine protein interactions in vitro and their effect on phosphorylation, the three genes wzb, wzd and wze were expressed in e. coli to obtain tagged and untagged proteins.

tyrosine phosphorylation of nine tyrosine-mutated wzd proteins in l. lactis
nine mutated wzd genes changing a different tyrosine codon to phenylalanine were expressed individually in concert with wze and wzb from l. rhamnosus rw-9595 m in l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> carrying one of the nine constructed plasmids . as negative controls, there was no phosphorylated protein when extracts of l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> with or without plasmid pmg36ct were probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody . all nine separate tyrosine mutated wzd proteins  were phosphorylated . for six mutants , band density was approximately equivalent to the wild-type wzd . two mutant proteins had slightly less band density than wild-type wzd  with ratios of  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the wzdy266f protein had the lowest ratio of  <dig>   with respect to wild-type wzd. wze  was also phosphorylated when co-expressed with each of the nine mutated wzd proteins in l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> , albeit to a lower level when wzd carried mutations y33f, y266f and y241f .figure  <dig>

overexpression of the 34 kda his6-tagged wzd protein from the wzd gene of l. rhamnosus atcc  <dig> was achieved in two e. coli strains, namely bl <dig> or c <dig> carrying pqewzd . untagged wzb and wze proteins of the predicted molecular mass were obtained in e. coli strain nm <dig> carrying either pqewzb  or pqewze. gst-tagged wze protein was obtained using both e. coli strains c <dig> or bl <dig> carrying pgstwze .figure  <dig>

tyrosine phosphorylation of his6-wzd and gst-wze expressed in e. coli
the phosphorylation state of the expressed proteins was verified prior to testing protein interactions. to detect any autophosphorylation, proteins were incubated with or without atp. as controls, cell lysates of the host strains bl <dig> and c <dig> carrying the vector plasmids did not show any tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, with or without added atp . in the absence of added atp, the his6-wzd purified from e. coli bl <dig> was recognized by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, which shows tyrosine phosphorylation . on the other hand, when purified after expression by strain c <dig>  the similar amount of his6-wzd was not phosphorylated after incubation either with or without atp , even though the protein was detected at by western blot using the anti-his-tag antibody . under these conditions, the amount of phosphorylated his6-wzd protein may be below the detection level of our assay.figure  <dig>

-wzd and gst-wze proteins expressed in
e. coli. tyrosine phosphorylation of his6-wzd and gst-wze was detected by using western immunoblotting with a mouse monoclonal antibody. coomassie stained 12% sds-page gel of his6-wzd expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  and c <dig> : incubated with 10 mm atp  and without atp .  detection of tyrosine phosphorylated his6-wzd expressed in e. coli bl <dig> and incubated with 10 mm atp  and without atp .  absence of detection of tyrosine phosphorylated his6-wzd expressed in e. coli c <dig> and incubated with 10 mm atp  and without atp .  detection of tyrosine phosphorylated gst-wze expressed in e. coli c <dig> incubated with 10 mm atp  and without atp .



the presence of gst-wze was confirmed by anti-gst antibody and, as a control, gst expressed alone was not detected by the phosphotyrosine antibody . the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody did detect phosphorylated gst-wze in cell lysates of e. coli c <dig> pgstwze  at the same level as in cell lysates of e. coli bl <dig> pgstwze  for the same amount of protein. the level of phosphorylated gst-wze protein did not differ in the presence or absence of 10 mm atp. however, the untagged native wze protein was not phosphorylated when produced by e. coli strains nm <dig> or bl <dig>  whether or not atp was present.

while gst-wze was slightly phosphorylated in all e. coli host strains tested, the tyrosine phosphorylation of his6-wzd depended on the strain of e. coli used for expression. the initial level of phosphorylation of these two proteins did not change when atp was added. the cause of the difference between strain bl <dig> and its derivative mutant c <dig> has been attributed to a lower amount of t <dig> rna polymerase in strain c <dig>  which reduces transcription levels of cloned genes, actually leading to a more stable over-expression of recombinant proteins by strain c <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation of his6-wzd may conceivably be carried out by a ptk of e. coli bl <dig>  as was observed in studies of other proteins  <cit> . in our study, no other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in the e. coli host strains used. udp-glucose dehydrogenase ywqf from b. subtilis was phosphorylated by ptk wzc from e. coli, showing that gram-negative ptk is capable of phosphorylating proteins from gram-positive species. wze possesses a tyrosine in a similar position as the tyrosine  <dig> implicated in autophosphorylation of wzc  in e. coli  <cit> . the autophosphorylation of tyrosine  <dig> did not occur without the n-terminal domain of wzc, which is similar to the tyrosine kinase transmembrane modulator protein from gram positive bacteria  <cit> . thus, initial phosphorylation of gst-wze implies that the presence of the gst tag may play a role as the modulator protein or that a protein of e. coli carries out tyrosine phosphorylation. although serine phosphorylation of gst has been demonstrated previously  <cit> , no tyrosine phosphorylation of gst itself was detected in our study . gst may, however, possibly be phosphorylated by wze. nevertheless, there is no evidence of higher phosphorylation when gst-wze is expressed alone, although the kinase is proposed to have autophosphorylation activity. this means that the wzd modulator protein is required for higher levels of phosphorylation of the wze tyrosine kinase, as described by bender & yother  <cit> . to our knowledge, no previous study has detected the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase transmembrane modulator protein in any gram-positive bacterial species.

interaction of his6-wzd with wzb and wze
untagged wzb and wze were not retained by the nickel-charged affinity resin itself , so they could be tested for affinity to resin-bound his6-wzd. wzb was not retained by his6-wzd after washing the resin , suggesting that no stable interaction was present between these two proteins. after incubating resin-bound his6-wzdc <dig> and wze together, the resin was divided into two fractions for washing either with or without atp. wze was retained by his6-wzd using the same washing conditions as with wzb . without added atp, the wash fraction did not contain any tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. however, when 200 μm atp was added to the washing solution, wze protein was released from resin-bound his6-wzd in each of three successive washing steps . after eluting the remaining bound proteins from the same column, only a small quantity of non-phosphorylated wze was associated with his6-wzd . moreover, using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the wzd protein was revealed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated after washing with 200 μm atp .figure  <dig>

gst-wze alone also did not bind to the ni2+ resin in the absence of his6-wzd . a cell lysate of e. coli c <dig> pgstwze was passed through a column containing purified his6-wzd expressed by either e. coli bl <dig>  or c <dig>  bound to the ni2+ resin . gst-wze was retained by his6-wzdbl <dig>  both in the presence and absence of 10 mm atp during incubation and washing . in the presence of atp, there was no discernible change of tyrosine phosphorylation of his6-wzdbl <dig> after the interaction . gst-wze was also retained by dephosphorylated his6-wzdc <dig>  in the presence and absence of 10 mm atp while yop was retained as well . yop treatment did not affect protein migration and was not found in the wash fraction. in the presence or absence of atp, his6-wzdc <dig> on the resin with gst-wze was not phosphorylated . bound gst-wze showed slightly more phosphorylated protein in the presence of atp, but the difference does not appear significant and there was no discernible change in phosphorylation either before or after the interaction with his6-wzd. the identical result was obtained using his6-wzdc <dig> without yop treatment and gst-wze.figure  <dig>

in contrast, the phosphorylation state of gst-wze in the wash fractions was very different from that bound to his6-wzd on the ni2+ resin. for the same amount of protein , gst-wze was found in the wash fraction with a high phosphorylation level , after interacting with his6-wzdbl <dig> in the presence of atp. in the absence of atp, the phosphorylated gst-wze signal in the wash fraction was much lower  for the same amount of protein . there appears to be some phosphorylated gst-wze retained by his6-wzd, but the highly phosphorylated gst-wze did not bind strongly to wzd. after interacting with his6-wzdc <dig>  gst-wze was washed out of the resin, and the low level phosphorylation does not appear to significantly differ in the presence or absence of atp .figure  <dig>

the results of this study reveal that no strong protein association was formed between wzb and wzd, while wze interacts with phosphorylated as well as non-phosphorylated wzd. when only slightly phosphorylated, gst-wze did not affect the phosphorylation of wzd, while wzd was phosphorylated after interaction with non-phosphorylated wze. this result shows that non-phosphorylated wze is able to phosphorylate wzd. in the presence of 10 mm atp, the unbound wze was highly phosphorylated after interaction with phosphorylated wzd, whereas wze released from interaction with non-phosphorylated wzd was not changed. the phosphorylation state of wze retained with wzd on the resin did not change after the interaction, regardless of the phosphorylation state of wzd. this means that phosphorylated wzd and atp are necessary to attain a higher phosphorylation state of wze and phosphorylated wze does not remain bound in close association with phosphorylated wzd.

cefalo et al.  <cit>  detected the interaction between wzd  and wze  in s. thermophilus and previous work done in s. pneumoniae  <cit>  showed that cpsc/cpsd  complex formation is necessary to detect tyrosine phosphorylated cpsd . our work shows evidence for this complex formation in l. rhamnosus and for tyrosine phosphorylation of both the kinase as well as the modulator protein. the results also support the role of wzd as a modulator of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase. eps was not produced after deletion of epsc  in s. thermophilus cnrz <dig>  <cit> . the wzd modulator protein from l. rhamnosus could be involved in the production of eps as proposed for epsc. indeed, several mutations occurring in the cpsc transmembrane modulator of a number of s. pneumoniae strains lead to defective cell wall attachment of cps  <cit> . these include two tyrosine mutations in the n-terminal region of cpsc  associated with a mucoid colony phenotype. in comparison with the l. rhamnosus wzd sequence, equivalent tyrosine residues can be found in similar positions  .

wzd from l. rhamnosus has nine tyrosine residues and the last one  is located in the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain. the wzd, wze and wzb genes from l. rhamnosus rw-9595 m were thus expressed in l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg <dig> in order to verify which tyrosine residues could be involved in wzd phosphorylation and whether wze is then phosphorylated in vivo. while each of the nine separate tyrosine mutations led to wzd phosphorylation, mutation of the c-terminal tyrosine  showed slightly weaker wzd phosphorylation than most of the other eight mutations. this suggests that more than one tyrosine residue participates in wzd phosphorylation, although tyr <dig> appears to be slightly more important. in all cases, wze was phosphorylated, although the phosphorylation levels of wze were slightly lower when wzd was mutated in positions y <dig> , y <dig> or y <dig> . a previous study observed that the c-terminal cytoplasmic domain of capa  was essential for phosphorylation of capb  in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . tocilj et al.  <cit>  proposed a role for the c-terminal y <dig> tyrosine residue in alpha helix stabilization of the modulator, but no phosphorylation was proposed. therefore, one or more of the mutated residues may be important for proper folding and membrane insertion of wzd to allow good interaction with wze, and thus facilitate the auto- or trans-phosphorylation of wze.

in s. pneumoniae d <dig>  when the cps2c  was deleted, no capsule was detected, but low molecular weight products could be observed  <cit> . defects in cell wall attachment were found when point mutations were introduced into cps2c, while some mutants were able to maintain wild type levels of total cps production, including the y82c mutation  <cit> . eps were not produced at all when the equivalent modulator encoded by epsa was deleted in l. lactis  <cit> . cps2c from s. pneumoniae strain d <dig> contains  <dig> tyrosine residues while cps2c from strain rx1-19 f contains only  <dig>  all located within the first 100 n-terminal residues, as does the modulator of s. thermophilus and s. aureus. no tyrosine residue appears conserved among all  <dig> putative pcp2b sequences compared from staphylococci, streptococci, lactococci and lactobacilli, although the tyrosine positioned right after the first transmembrane domain is found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> sequences aligned. this indicates that the precise function of pcp2b could differ among species. the lactobacilli pcp2b sequences contain a supplementary stretch of  <dig> amino acids including  <dig> to  <dig> tyrosine residues that are not found in sequences from streptococci, lactococci and staphylococci. wzd , epsa  and epsb  have a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tyrosine residues, respectively. the genera lactobacillus and lactococcus have common conserved tyrosines  in their modulator protein sequences. these conserved tyrosines, especially the tyrosine located near the c-terminal transmembrane region, may be associated with polymer extension and release instead of attachment. an equivalent c-terminal tyrosine  <dig> is absent from the cpsc sequences of s. pneumoniae, and s. thermophilus as well as the capa sequence of s. aureus. future work will need to focus on how these differences impact the production of capsular polysaccharides versus the production of released high molecular weight eps.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the activity of wzd is also modulated through tyrosine phosphorylation of more than one tyrosine residue, allowing the phosphorylation of wze. this new information suggests that further modification of the model for the control of eps elongation can be proposed . the non-phosphorylated complex may allow polysaccharides to be released instead of attached to the cell wall. when wze phosphorylates wzd, interaction of wzd with the polymerase may promote polysaccharide elongation  <cit> . destabilization of the protein interaction between wzd and wze liberates wze to interact with other non-phosphorylated wzd or wze proteins. when wzd is phosphorylated and atp is present, a transitory interaction allows wze to autophosphorylate or transphosphorylate other wze proteins, possibly slowing polymerization and leading to the attachment of polysaccharide to the cell wall if a ligase is present.figure  <dig> 
model proposed for the tyrosine switch controlling eps polymerization and attachment.  <dig>  non-phosphorylated wzd and wze interact by forming a complex leading to release of eps  rather than attachment .  <dig>  in the presence of atp, wze phosphorylates wzd, allowing chain elongation by the polymerase . this phosphorylation of wzd destabilizes the protein interaction with wze, allowing wze to either bind with other non-phosphorylated wzd proteins, or undergo auto- or trans-transphosphorylation.  <dig>  a transitory interaction between phosphor-rylated wzd and wze in the presence of atp is necessary for the phosphorylation of wze, possibly allowing the attachment of polysaccharide to the cell wall . phosphatase activity of wzb for dephosphorylating wzd and wze would return the cycle to the non-phosphorylated wzd/wze complex that allows release of polysaccharide polymers . question marks indicate proposed steps.



l. rhamnosus atcc  <dig> and rw-9595 m produce exopolysaccharides through a polymerase-dependent mechanism. future experiments will focus on the role of the wzb phosphatase in complex formation or dissociation, the relationship between the wzd/wze complex formation and eps polymerization as well as the interaction of other proteins with this complex, including interactions of the polymerization complex with the proteins involved in synthesizing and transporting the repeat units. this approach will contribute to determining their function in modulating the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides by l. rhamnosus.
