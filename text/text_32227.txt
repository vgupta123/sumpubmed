BACKGROUND
pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses often cause significant damage to human society and economics  <cit> . the influenza viruses are divided into subtypes based on major differences in the surface proteins hemagglutinin  and neuraminidase , which are the main targets for the human immune system. in circulating influenza viruses, gradually accumulated mutations on ha cause immunologically distinct strains, which lead to antigenic drift . the antigenic drift often implies that vaccines should be updated to correspond with the dominant epidemic strains  <cit> . mapping the genetic evolution to the antigenic drift of influenza viruses is one of great critical issues to public health. many methods have been proposed to study the antigenic drift and vaccine development  <cit> .

retrospective quantitative analyses of the genetic data have revealed important insights into the evolution of influenza viruses  <cit> . in the current global influenza surveillance system, the ferret serum hemagglutinin-inhibition  assay is the primary method to define the antigenic variants. several studies  <cit>  used statistical models to predict the antigenic variant of a given pair ha sequences based on these known hi assays and their respective ha sequences. furthermore, smith et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the antigenic evolution was more punctuated than the genetic evolution, and the genetic change sometime have disproportionately large antigenic effect. recently, few studies discusses the relationship between evolution and co-mutated positions on influenza virus  <cit> .

in this study, we proposed a method to predict the antigenic variants by identifying critical positions and rules which describe when one  strain will not be recognized by antibodies against another  strain. our method is also able to detect the co-mutated positions for predicting the antigenic variants. these critical positions and rules were evaluated on two datasets, which consist of  <dig> and  <dig>  pairs. the results demonstrate that our model is able to reflect the biological meanings and achieve high prediction accuracy.

RESULTS
data set
we collected an hi-assay data set, which contains  <dig> pairs of ha sequences with  <dig> ha  sequences with  <dig> amino acids from  <dig> to  <dig>  from related work  <cit> . according to this data set, we applied the decision tree c <dig>   <cit>  to predict the antigenic variants by identifying antigenic critical positions as well as discovering the rules and co-mutated positions. in this data set, the main samples  consist of pairs of vaccine-circulating strains, and for each pair it was known whether there is inhibition of the circulating strain by antibodies against the vaccine strain . vaccine strains are selected by world health organization  and are often the dominant strains of influenza seasons. each pair includes the hi-assay value  and a bit string with  <dig> binary bits by aligning a pair of ha sequences . for a specific position on a pair of ha sequences, the binary value is " <dig> " if the residue types of the two sequences on this position are different; conversely, its binary value is " <dig> ". in general, an influenza vaccine should be updated if an hi-assay value is more than  <dig>  between the current vaccine strain and the strains expected to circulate in next season  <cit> . the antigenic distance is defined as the reciprocal of the geometric mean of two ratios between the heterologous and homologous antibody titers  <cit> . among  <dig> pairs of ha sequences,  <dig> pairs with antigenic distance â‰¥  <dig> are considered as "antigenic variants" and  <dig> pairs with antigenic distance <  <dig> are classified as "similar viruses". for example, the antigenic distance of the pair ha sequences, a/port_chalmers/1/ <dig> and a/victoria/3/ <dig>  is  <dig> and this pair is considered as "antigenic variants". conversely, the antigenic distance of the pair ha sequences, a/wuhan/359/ <dig> and a/nanchang/933/ <dig>  is  <dig> and this pair is considered as "similar viruses".

in addition, we prepared another hi-assay data set proposed by smith et al.  <cit>  to independently evaluate our model and compare with other methods for predicting the antigenic variants. this data set consists of  <dig> h3n <dig> viruses, which are clustered into  <dig> antigenic groups. we assume that a virus-pair in the same antigenic group is considered as a "similar viruses" pair and a virus-pair in different groups is considered as an "antigenic variants" pair. finally, we yielded  <dig>  hi measurements and these sequences were extracted from supporting materials of publication  <cit> .

antigenic critical positions on ha
in this study, we used the information gain  and shannon entropy to measure the scores of an amino acid, which locates at the specific position on ha, for discriminating antigenic variants and similar viruses . the highest and lowest values of both ig and entropy are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. an amino acid with high ig at a specific position implied that this position is highly correlated to the antigenic variants. an amino acid with high entropy means that this position is often mutated in the data set. figure  <dig> shows the relationship of ig values and entropies of ha positions. the summaries of some amino acid positions are listed in table  <dig>  of the  <dig> amino acids of ha,  <dig> positions are considered to lie in or near the five antibody combining sites  which are labelled a through e  <cit> . the first rank  locates at the epitope a of ha. its ig and entropy are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. among  <dig> pairs of ha sequences in the training set, the position 145-a mutates on  <dig> pairs and  <dig> pairs are the antigenic variants. this result implies that a mutation on this position highly induces an antigenic drift. this observation is consistent to previous results  <cit> , that is, the single amino acid substitution n145k can be responsible for antigenic cluster transition. we observed that the other positions with high ig values obtained the similar behaviours.

 <dig> the epitope of the position on ha sequence.

 <dig> the position is under positive selection defined by bush et al.  <cit> .

 <dig> the position is a cluster-difference substitution defined by smith et al.  <cit> .

the relationship between ig values and entropies of  <dig> positions in ha is shown in figure  <dig> by excluding  <dig> positions, which have zero for both ig and entropy. all positions can be classified into four groups according to the values of ig  and entropy . those  <dig> positions with high ig and high entropy  are considered as critical positions in this work. according to the ha structure obtained from protein data bank ,  <dig> positions of them locate at five epitopes and  <dig> of them are on the surface  by using pymol  <cit> . the positions in area ii  imply that high genetic diversity may infer low antigenic discriminating score. for example, the positions  have high entropies and low ig values . among  <dig> pairs of ha sequences, the position 226-d mutates on  <dig> pairs and  <dig> of these pairs are the antigenic variant. a low ig position indicates that a mutation on this position less preference to be an antigenic variant. our method can avoid the disadvantage of considering only the genetic data, which was widely used in previous works.

the relationship between ig values and structural locations of  <dig> positions is shown in figureure 3a. the positions with four highest ig values  are blue and other positions are near to gray based on the ig values. the positions with high ig values are located on the protein surface. three  of top four ig-value positions are located around the receptor-binding site, which is key for neutralizing influenza virus. in addition, the high ig positions also prefer to locate on the top head, which are more exposed and preferable recognized by antibodies, of ha and on the interface between ha monomers.

the rules of antigenic variants and predicting accuracies
we used the decision tree  to build a model for predicting antigenic variants of human influenza a/h3n <dig> virus. based on the ig values of  <dig> amino acid positions derived from  <dig> pairs in training data set, six amino acid positions are selected as internal nodes in this tree. the first rule of this tree is that the antigenic type is predicted as the antigenic variant if the position  <dig> is mutated, that is, the residue types of a pair of sequences on the position  <dig> are different. among  <dig> pairs of sequences in the training set,  <dig> pairs can apply this rule and  <dig> pairs can be predicted correctly. the last rule of this tree is that the antigenic type is predicted as the similar viruses if six positions  are not mutated.

based on this model, we can derive seven rules and the predicted accuracies are  <dig> %  for training data set and  <dig> %  for independent data set, respectively. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  our method outperformed two comparative methods, i.e. wilson & cox   <cit>  and lee & chen   <cit> , on the independent data set. for the independent data set, the accuracies of wilson & cox method on predicting the antigenic variants and the similar viruses are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. conversely, our model performed well for predicting the antigenic variants  and the similar viruses .

 <dig> the number of the pairs in the cluster.

co-mutated positions for antigenic variants
two amino acid positions may mutate simultaneously to cause antigenic drift or highly co-evolution in h3n <dig> virus. understanding the co-mutation of amino acid position-pairs is one of the key steps to recognizing the antigen-antibody interactions. here, we used the co-mutation score, s , between the position i and its co-mutated position j to measure the co-mutated pair  for predicting the antigenic variants. we calculated all of the co-mutated combinations  of  <dig> amino acid positions which mutated more than once on  <dig> pairs of ha sequences in the training data set.

in the tree model , the position 145-a is selected as first node and has  <dig> significant co-mutated positions . the top three significant co-mutated positions of 145-a are ,  and . the 145-a, 278-c, and 137-a are the residues to cause the transition from the cluster en <dig> into the cluster vi <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the residue 156-b has  <dig> significant co-mutated positions . seven  of these  <dig> positions co-mutate with 156-b to cause the transition from the cluster tx <dig> into the cluster bk <dig>  <cit> .

discussion
previous works using genetic data for identifying great diversity positions, that under immune selection, have shown fruitful results  <cit> . however, smith et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that antigenic evolution is more punctuated than genetic evolution, which implies only genetic data may not enough to detect antigenic critical positions. for example, the antigenic discriminating score  of the position 226-d is low, while its genetic diversity  is largest. the position 226-d is also selected as positive selection  <cit> . according to  <dig> pairs in the training set, the position 226-d has  <dig> mutations, but  <dig> of them are "similar viruses" pairs. therefore, its antigenic discriminating score is low and a mutation on this position does not cause the antigenic drift. the position 121-d, which is under positive selection, has the similar behaviour.

although the hi assay can successfully detect antigenic drift, this assay is labour-intensive and time-consuming. therefore, the quantity of hi data is far fewer than sequence data and sometimes have the problem of bias sampling  <cit> . the position 164-b, which identified by smith et al. as cluster-difference substitutions from  <dig> sequences  <cit> , has  <dig> mutations in  <dig> pairs and all of them happened in "antigenic variants" pairs. mutations on this position  have high preference to antigenic variant. but our method didn't select this position because the genetic diversity  of this position is not high enough.

in the independent data set , the accuracies of three methods are more than 96% for the "antigenic variants", but their accuracies on the "similar viruses" pairs are significantly different . the method proposed by wilson and cox  <cit>  falsely predicts 67% of "similar viruses" pairs, which implies this method is very sensitive in the same antigenic group. compare our model with the hamming distance  model based on epitope positions proposed by lee & chen  <cit> , our model have high accuracies in three groups, i.e. be <dig>  wu <dig> and sy <dig> . for example, for  <dig> "similar viruses" pairs in the be <dig> group, the hd model falsely predicted  <dig> pairs, which are correctly predicted by our model, and the average hd of these  <dig> pairs is  <dig> . most of these  <dig> pairs mutate on seven positions . except the positions 137-a and 197-b, the other five positions have low antigenic discriminating scores based on our model.

for each the position-pairs  and  in figure  <dig>  their z-scores are different because the position i and j have different antigenic discriminating scores. for example, the z-scores of position-pairs  and  are  <dig>  and - <dig> , respectively. in addition, the ig values of the positions 156-b and 133-a are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the antigenic effect of only mutation on the position 133-a is not significant. on the other hand, the antigenic discriminating score is significant when the position 133-a co-mutates with the position 156-b. among  <dig> pairs in the training set, the position 133-a occurs  <dig> mutations and  <dig> of them are "antigenic variants" pairs, and  <dig> pairs of them co-mutate with the position 156-b. this position pair is observed to cause the transitions from the cluster tx <dig> into the cluster bk <dig> and from the cluster be <dig> into the cluster be <dig>  <cit> .

among  <dig> positions of ha sequences, 137-a, 193-b, and 160-b are top three positions with the highest numbers of co-mutated positions. the position 137-a has  <dig> co-mutation positions and top three pairs are ,  and . these four positions are observed to cause the transitions from the cluster en <dig> into the cluster vi <dig> and from the cluster vi <dig> into the cluster tx <dig>  <cit> .

there are total  <dig> significant position-pairs but only  <dig> pairs of them observed in cluster-difference substitutions  <cit> . for example,  <dig> pairs with top  <dig> z-scores but not identified as cluster-difference substitution are: , , , , , ,  , , , , , ,  and . nine pairs of them could be observed in the  <dig> fixation  <cit>  in which they analyzed large amount of ha protein sequences . these results imply our method is able to detect potential co-mutated positions related to antigenic drift from limited hi-data.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates our model is robustness and feasibility by considering both genetic and antigenic data. based on decision tree, our method is able to identify critical amino acid positions of ha and the rules of antigenic variants for influenza h3n <dig> viruses. the accuracies of our method are  <dig> % and  <dig> % for training set and independent data set, respectively, and our method is significantly better than other two methods on these two sets. the identified critical amino acid positions are similar to related works and the co-mutated positions are able to reflect the biological meanings. we believe that our method is useful for vaccine development and the evolution of human influenza a viruses.
