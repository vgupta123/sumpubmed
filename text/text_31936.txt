BACKGROUND
the taxonomic assemblage of endosymbiotic wolbachia α-protobacteria occurs very commonly in insects, mites, crustaceans and nematodes  <cit>  and is responsible for a huge variety of reproductive peculiarities. one of the most common of these peculiarities is the incompatibility of crosses between infected males and uninfected females  <cit> , but diverse phenomena including phenotypic male feminisation  <cit> , male killing  <cit> , and thelytokous parthenogenesis  <cit>  have also been conclusively attributed to wolbachia infections. folsomia candida  is a cosmopolitan species of springtail, which is widely used as a standard organism in toxicological assays and as a biological marker of soil pollution  <cit> . although there have been hints that males of the species may exist  <cit> , it is generally accepted that the species is made up entirely of females  <cit> . certainly, it is well established that f. candida reproduces by thelytokous parthenogenesis for the vast majority of the time. from karyotype studies, we know that f. candida uses a diplodiploid  mechanism of sex determination  <cit> . f. candida is also host to a strain of wolbachia which is unique from the strains known from other taxa  <cit> . the effects upon the hosts of this unique supergroup e of wolbachia are yet to be characterised  <cit> .

it has been argued that the wolbachia that induces parthenogenesis may be functionally restricted to organisms which have a haplodiploid mechanism of sex determination  <cit> . the rationale for this argument is that, in haplodiploids, diploidisation of the unfertilised egg is all that is required to achieve sustainable parthenogenesis. diplodiploid organisms, on the other hand, must also overcome the additional obstacle of inducing eggs to develop . whereas we now have many demonstrations of wolbachia-induced parthenogenesis in haplodiploids , to date, we have not been able to obtain good evidence of an equivalent phenomenon in diplodiploid hosts.

we administered the antibiotics tetracycline and rifampicin ad libitum in the yeast food source of f. candida ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %) over two generations. elimination of wolbachia from this host has failed in the past  <cit>  but, assuming success, three outcomes were judged possible.

 if the wolbachia are the obligatory agents of parthenogenesis or reproduction, their elimination would render all-female f. candida entirely sterile. the potential for wolbachia to serve such a critical survival function in the biology of a diplodiploid organism has never been shown.

 if f. candida possesses an independent mechanism of parthenogenesis and is able to regulate independently reproductive developmental processes, production of females by females could continue even in the absence of wolbachia .

 if males of f. candida do occur , elimination of wolbachia could conceivably result in production of males via a post-zygotic mechanism of sex-chromosome elimination known from another  collembolan  <cit> . of course, the common haplodiploid phenomenon of production of haploid males in the absence of wolbachia-enforced diploidisation of the nucleus can be ruled out for this diplodiploid species. the discovery of males would raise the possibility of sexual reproduction, with all its genetic consequences, in a species which has hitherto been considered entirely asexual.

RESULTS
wolbachia infection
we randomly selected  <dig> adult springtails from second-generation populations of:  the f. candida control treatment ;  the f. candida high-dose  tetracycline treatment;  the f. candida high-dose  rifampicin treatment; and  the sibling species folsomia fimetaria, which has males, reproduces sexually, and is reputed not to host wolbachia. we used wolbachia-specific primers in polymerase chain reaction  analyses of the total dna extracted from each of these  <dig> individuals to assess whether the bacteria had been eliminated . wolbachia-specific amplification products were not found in any springtails from the high-dose rifampicin treatment, indicating that this treatment successfully eliminated the bacteria. similarly, none of the  <dig> f. fimetaria individuals tested positive for wolbachia, and it is thus indeed likely that the two are not symbiotic. perhaps surprisingly, all f. candida individuals from the high-dose tetracycline treatment tested positive for wolbachia, along with all those from the control populations. the previously reported inefficacy of tetracycline in curing folsomia of wolbachia  <cit>  is thus supported.

population parameters
clear differences in the population growth rates of high-dose rifampicin treatments compared with high-dose tetracycline treatments were also evident, although these differences did not emerge until the second generation . the growth rate of rifampicin populations differed significantly between the two generations  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ), because of a second-generation dose effect whereby growth in the  <dig> % and  <dig> % treatments was significantly lower than that in the  <dig> % treatments which, in turn, was lower than those in the  <dig> % or 0% treatments . no other differences in growth rate among the treatments and/or generations were detectable.

slight differences in growth rate, clutch size and hatching rate were found among some clones. however, as these differences did not significantly interact with the effects of interest , data have been pooled and clone-specific differences are not presented.

clutch size
at week  <dig> of the first-generation, individuals from the tetracycline treatments had a significantly larger mean clutch size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  than individuals from the rifampicin treatments, which had a mean clutch size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ). no dose effect on clutch size was detectable in the tetracycline treatments . however, clutch size was significantly affected by rifampicin dose , reaching sizes as low as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at the highest  <dig> % dose.

over the 6-month observation period , the clutch size of f. candida differed significantly by month . while clutch size did not differ among the first  <dig> months , the sizes observed in the final  <dig> months  were significantly greater than those recorded in the preceding months. in f. fimetaria, the average clutch size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  did not fluctuate significantly across the  <dig> months.

hatching rate
the average hatching rate for clutches laid at week  <dig> of the first-generation tetracycline treatments was  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. hatching rate was not found to be significantly affected by dose in the tetracycline treatments . however, dose was significant for hatching rate in the rifampicin populations . hatching rates at week  <dig> of the first generation fell from around 50% for doses of  <dig> % and  <dig> % to just  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the  <dig> % rifampicin dose. hatching rates were not systematically recorded in the second generation but this rate was observed to decline rapidly to zero in the  <dig> % rifampicin treatments.

nymph:adult ratio
marked demographic changes occurred because of prolonged exposure to high doses of rifampicin. in the first generation, the average nymph:adult ratio  of the tetracycline treatments was very similar to that of rifampicin treatments . four weeks into the second generation, the average nymph:adult ratio in the tetracycline treatments was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , reflecting the increase expected from young, newly founded populations. in contrast, the nymph:adult ratio in the second generation of rifampicin populations at the same stage had dropped to just  <dig>  ±  <dig> . this treatment difference in week  <dig> of the second generation was already highly significant  and it had become absolute by  <dig> weeks, when nymphs were entirely absent from all the populations exposed to  <dig> % rifampcin and  <dig> of the  <dig> populations exposed to  <dig> % rifampicin. the individuals of these populations were both devoid of wolbachia and totally sterile.

during the 6-month observation period, the nymph:adult ratio remained at  <dig> for the entire period in f. candida . in f. fimetaria, nymphs of all instars were present for all  <dig> months: the nymph:adult ratio did not differ significantly across months, being  <dig>  ±  <dig>  on average.

males
although males were easily identified in populations of f. fimetaria , they were never found in any f. candida population.

discussion
the elimination of microbial symbionts is likely to be responsible for the sterility observed in f. candida.  host sterility is thus attributable to the removal of a microbial strain that facilitates parthenogenesis and/or other reproductive processes. we were careful to distinguish between the facilitation of parthenogenetic diploidisation of the zygote and other non-parthenogenetic reproductive development because it is known that wolbachia can affect either of these discrete processes. for example, in several trichogramma wasp species, wolbachia is responsible for gamete duplication   <cit> , while, in asobara tabida, it has the even more fundamental role of facilitating successful oogenesis by inhibiting cell death  <cit> . we can rule out the possibility that wolbachia plays a role in oogenesis in f. candida because of the continued production of sterile eggs in the face of long-term exposure to rifampicin.

in the current system, we cannot unequivocally attribute the identity of the sterility-associated microbe to wolbachia: such a definitive identification could only be made if we had demonstrated that infection of an uninfected collembolan population with wolbachia would lead to parthenogenesis and/or restoration of reproductive ability. nevertheless, there exists excellent evidence to indicate that wolbachia is the likely culprit. firstly, we can rule out another common bacterial agent of reproductive alternation, cardinium, because this symbiont is absent in f. candida  <cit> . in f. candida, wolbachia bacteria are extremely abundant within both the early oocyte and the embryo, and cytological observations hint that wolbachia could possibly be involved in producing a diploid zygote through the prevention of the separation of sister chromatids at meiosis ii  <cit> . we thus suggest that the sterility we observed occurs because wolbachia plays the crucial role of inducing parthenogenesis. an alternative explanation is that f. candida is independently able to produce a diploid zygote but that wolbachia is an obligate mutualist with a crucial role in reproduction, regardless of whether this reproduction is asexual or sexual.

rifampicin had a negative influence on clutch size in f. candida. we interpret this effect to be a consequence of physiological impairments that were not unexpected: rifampicin is known to affect mitochondrial rna synthesis in eukaryotes at very high concentrations  <cit> . however, we note that, while clutch sizes increased to normal levels within  <dig> month of cessation of the rifampicin treatment, total sterility continued. this observation indicates that, while the toxic effects of rifampicin impaired reproductive physiology, these effects are not the cause of sterility. while a similar negative effect on clutch size was not mirrored in f. fimetaria, our casual observations lead us to suggest that the high dose of rifampicin was also physiologically detrimental in this species but that other traits, which were not systematically measured, tended to be affected.

the mode of action of tetracycline is to inhibit protein synthesis by preventing the association of aminoacyl-trna with the bacterial ribosome  <cit> . the mode of action of rifampicin is to disrupt an even earlier step in the process of protein synthesis: rifampin binds to prokaryotic dna-dependent rna polymerase, inhibiting transcription of dna to messenger rna and thereby precluding subsequent translation of rna to proteins  <cit> . this different mode of action may be the cause of rifampicin's efficacy in curing f. candida of wolbachia.

although this study found no evidence for the existence of males of f. candida, it remains possible that such males do occur rarely in natural populations  <cit> . if males are ever found or, indeed, if females of f. candida are able to cross with males from a sibling species that is yet to be described  <cit> , f. frati, personal communication], future experiments may shed valuable light on whether wolbachia infection  can influence the possibility of sexual reproduction in the extremely common study species that is f. candida.

this newly discovered role for wolbachia as an obligate component of reproduction in a diplodiploid animal broadens the already diverse repertoire of phenomena that has been created through the co-evolution of these bacteria and their multitude of hosts. the obligate symbiosis between f. candida and wolbachia is not seen in other diplodiploid hosts such as the termite reticulitermes speratus, which is able to continue to reproduce by an independent method of parthenogenesis even after it has been cured of wolbachia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
examination of the available evidence on the underlying cause of the observed post-antibiotic sterility suggests that, contrary to prior belief, endosymbiont-facilitated parthenogenesis may not be functionally restricted to haplodiploids. future work will shed light on the exact mechanism by which microbial endosymbionts can enable parthenogenetic reproduction in diplodiploids. the most likely agent of this reproductive facilitation is wolbachia. the wolbachia associated with f. candida belongs to supergroup e and the current results give the first indication of what effect this discrete clade of endosymbionts has on its hosts. future work may even yield evidence that the widespread and adaptable symbionts that are wolbachia have achieved yet another evolutionary feat: usurpation of sperm's role of inducing an egg to commence embryonic development.
