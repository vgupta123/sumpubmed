BACKGROUND
in modern biotechnology, many of the fermentations producing high volume/low price products make use of microbial strains which have been improved by classical mutagenesis using uv light or mutagenic chemicals. information about the loci which became altered in the process of mutation and selection for improved product formation is scarce, if available at all. one notable exception is penicillin production by the fungus penicillium chrysogenum  <cit> , where the early mutation program has been shown to have removed detoxification reactions for the side chain precursor and has increased the biosynthetic capacity by amplification of the gene cluster for its production. in the case of the industrial cellulase producing fungus trichoderma reesei, the anamorph of the pantropical ascomycete hypocrea jecorina, all of the strains that are currently used on a commercial scale have been ultimately derived from one single isolate which was collected on the solomon islands during world war ii  <cit> . the genetic basis of the respective mutations which led to enhanced cellulase production in these industrial strains is essentially unknown. however, b.s. montenecourt and d.e. eveleigh prepared two separate lines of mutants which led to the hypercellulolytic strains rut c <dig> and rl-p <dig> , of which h. jecorina rut c <dig> has become the most frequently used strain for laboratory cellulase production  <cit> . in this strain two of its genetic changes have been described: one is a truncation in the cre <dig> gene encoding cre <dig> the carbon catabolite repressor protein, which renders this strain carbon catabolite derepressed  <cit> ; and another one leading to a frameshift mutation in the glycoprotein processing β-glucosidase ii encoding gene  <cit> . electrophoretic karyotyping showed that the two largest chromosomes in rut c <dig> are somewhat smaller, whereas the other five chromosomes are somewhat larger, resulting in a total increase in genome size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbps  <cit> . gene mapping revealed a history of significant recombination events between the seven chromosomes, but no gene losses were observed so far  <cit> . the only exception that was noted was the absence of hybridization of one random clone  in rut c <dig>  which hybridized to chromosome iv in strain qm6a and chromosome i in strain qm <dig>  <cit> . this suggests the presence of many more changes in rut c <dig>  which have not been uncovered until today.

due to its carbon catabolite derepressed phenotype, h. jecorina rut c <dig> has frequently been used as a reference strain in studies on the regulation of gene expression  <cit>  or cell biology  <cit> . in a similar type of study, we have recently observed that the transcript of a gene was completely absent from rut c <dig>  and subsequently we found that also the gene was absent from this strain . in the attempt to identify the reason for the absence of this gene, we discovered that h. jecorina rut c <dig> lacks a large  segment of genes present on scaffold  <dig> of the genomic sequence of the wild-type strain h. jecorina qm6a ,  <cit> . the identification of these genes, and their correlation with changes in the phenotype of h. jecorina rut c <dig> compared to strains qm6a and qm <dig>  are reported in this paper.

methods
fungal strains and culture conditions
the hypocrea jecorina strains qm6a , qm <dig> , ng  <dig>  and rut c <dig>  were used throughout this study. they were maintained on pda slants , and stock cultures kept at -80°c.

for shake flask cultures,  <dig> ml of mandels andreotti  medium  <cit>  with carbon sources added as given at the respective results sections, was suspended into  <dig> l erlenmeyer flasks, inoculated with  <dig> ×  <dig> spores, and incubated on a rotary shaker at 28°c and  <dig> rpm. to induce polyol dehydrogenases, glycerol 1%  was used as a carbon source. cultures were harvested after  <dig> hrs by gentle filtration, and replaced onto fresh ma medium with either l-arabinose, erythritol or xylitol as an inducer , and incubated for further  <dig> hrs. at this time they were harvested and used to prepare cell-free extracts .

detection production of antimicrobial agents
secretion of potential antimicrobial polyketides was tested by an agar diffusion method and plate confrontation tests. for the former, culture filtrates from various time points during growth- and stationary phase on d-glucose and lactose as a carbon source were sampled, proteins denatured by heating , and the samples then concentrated to a tenth of their volume in a speed vac. they were then filtered through  <dig> μ filters  and pipetted into  <dig> mm holes punched into agar plates containing inocula of escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. in the plate confrontation tests,  <dig> mm diameter agar plugs of mycelia of the two strains of h. jecorina were placed  <dig> cm apart from a respective colony of the same microbes. the presence of an antimicrobial component was indicated in both methods by a clearing zone.

nucleic acid isolation and hybridisation
chromosomal dna and total rna were isolated as described  <cit> . standard methods  <cit>  were used for electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization of nucleic acids.

pcr analysis
the open reading frames described in the results section were amplified from h. jecorina qm <dig> and rut c <dig> genomic dna using the gotaq® system  with  <dig>  μm of sequence specific primers  and  <dig> mm mgcl <dig>  the amplification protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step  followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation , annealing  and elongation  and was concluded by a final  <dig> min elongation step .

genome walking
to identify the 5' end of the deletion, the genomewalker™ universal kit  was used. briefly, this method first constructs pools of uncloned, adaptor-ligated genomic dna fragments. then, two pcr amplifications are preformed per library: the first uses the outer adaptor primer  provided in the kit and the outer, gene-specific primer . the resulting pcr mixture is then used as a template for a secondary or "nested" pcr with the nested adaptor primer  and the nested gene-specific primer . the dna fragments were then cloned and sequenced. pcr amplifications were performed using the long pcr enzyme mix . distinct pcr products were amplified from libraries constructed with drai and stui endonucleases and sequenced .

amplification and sequencing of the cre <dig> locus in h. jecorina rut c30
the wild-type h. jecorina cre <dig> locus is located on scaffold  <dig>  and its open reading frame  spans from 786955– <dig> . oligonucleotides used for the amplification of the cre <dig>  mutation in strain rut c <dig> and are given in table  <dig> 

enzyme extraction and assays
preparation of cell free extracts and assay of xylitol and l-arabinitol dehydrogenases was performed essentially as described previously  <cit> . erythritol dehydrogenase was measured in the same way as l-arabinitol dehydrogenase, but using  <dig> mm erythritol as a substrate.

microscopical analysis
conidida from  <dig> –  <dig> day old cultures were collected and suspended in liquid mandels andreotti medium  <cit>  containing either 1% or 10%  glucose and cultivated at 28°c.  <dig> μl drops of conidial suspension were placed on large cover slips and examined at room temperature by using differential interference contrast optics with a 60×  water immersion plan apo objective on an inverted nikon te <dig> microscope . images were captured with a nikon dxm1200f digital camera and transferred into adobe photoshop software  for further processing.

biolog phenotype microarray analysis
global carbon assimilation patterns were investigated using biolog ff microplate™ , using the protocol published recently  <cit> . briefly, h. jecorina strains were pregrown on  <dig> g·l- <dig> malt extract agar, and  <dig> μl of a conidial suspension from them  dispensed into each of the wells of a biolog ff microplate™ . inoculated microplates were incubated in the dark at 30°c, and percent absorbance determined after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h at  <dig> nm. analyses were repeated at least three times for each strain.

statistical analysis
basic statistical methods such as multiple regression analysis and analysis of variance  as well as multivariate exploratory techniques  were performed using statistica  <dig>   data analysis software system.

sequence analysis and phylogeny
the genome sequence of h. jecorina is available  <cit> . to screen the genome for genes missing in strain rut c <dig>  the "browse" function was used. genes are identified by their protein id number . sequence analysis of the genes identified to be missing in h. jecorina rut c <dig> was performed with interproscan  <cit> ) and smart . proteins with most similar sequences were identified by blastx <cit> . for phylogenetic analysis, protein sequences were aligned using clustalx  <dig>   <cit> , the alignment edited with genedoc  <dig>   <cit>  and the phylogenetic analysis performed in mega  <dig>   <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of a genome fragment missing in h. jecorina rut c30
the starting point of our analysis was a rhamnogalacturonase gene rgx <dig>  which is located on scaffold  <dig> in the h. jecorina genome database, and which is expressed in h. jecorina qm <dig> but not in strain rut c <dig> . consequently, we tested by pcr whether this gene is actually present in the latter strain. using the rgx1-specific primers given in table  <dig>  a clear product of expected size could be amplified from strain qm <dig>  but not from rut c <dig> . since this could indicate a gene deletion at this locus, we then designed primers for the amplification of the immediate 5' and 3' flanking genes . as these two genes were apparently absent from strain rut c <dig> too , a larger gene lesion was assumed. therefore we screened for presence of genes with wider distance from the rgx <dig> locus until positive hits were found, and then reduced the intervals until the genes immediately flanking the gap could be identified. thereby the first gene located 3' of the gap in rut c <dig> was identified as a nitrilase, id  <dig>  however, no gene could be found in the 5' direction of the gap, because even amplification of the most 5' located gene on scaffold  <dig> was not possible in strain rut c <dig> 

since these data suggested that the gap may be continued on another, unknown scaffold, we applied a genome walking strategy. primers were designed to hybridize within the intergenic region between the gene encoding a hypothetical protein, id  <dig>  and the gene encoding a nitrilase, id  <dig>  and within the coding region of id  <dig> . interestingly, in contrast to our assumptions, this method identified the 5' end of the gap close to the beginning of scaffold  <dig> in an at-rich region . this breakpoint localizes within a large intron in the 5'-half of an orf encoding a putative rhodanese-like protein id  <dig>  this gene displays a high number of unusually long introns , and it is possible that these either represent annotation errors or it is a pseudogene. a closer investigation of this gene was beyond the scope of this paper, however.

the 3' end of the gap identified by genome walking corresponded to the region identified by pcr amplification and specified it at + <dig> bp of scaffold  <dig> in the 5' nontranscribed area of the nitrilase-encoding gene . thus, this analysis provides evidence that h. jecorina rut c <dig> contains an approximately  <dig> kb large gap on scaffold  <dig>  which in h. jecorina qm6a  <cit>  contains  <dig> orfs  and that most of these genes are not present in the genome anymore.

the 85-kb deletion is unlinked to the cre <dig> mutation
as the reason for this gene deletion in rut c <dig> is unknown, we wondered whether it would be topologically related to the cre <dig>  mutation. the cre <dig> locus in this strain has been shown to be truncated  <cit> , but the exact length of the mutation and its genomic location has not yet been reported. a blast search of the h. jecorina genome sequence database with the cloned cre <dig> gene identified it to be located on scaffold 2: 786955– <dig> , and thus distant from the locus of the lesion which was identified in this paper. in order to identify the cre <dig>  mutation, we amplified and sequenced the cre <dig> locus in strain rut c <dig>  using the primers cre1fw and creiir , pcr with qm <dig> dna resulted in a  <dig> bp fragment as expected, whereas rut c <dig> yielded a fragment of  <dig> bp only. sequencing of the fragment obtained with rut c <dig>  and its alignment with the sequence of scaffold  <dig>  revealed the loss of a  <dig> bp fragment which starts 3' of the region encoding the cre <dig> zinc finger and reaches into a noncoding region. the coding region of the immediately following gene  was not affected.

in silico identification of the genes lacking in h. jecorina rut c30
in order to evaluate the impact of the detected gene losses on the phenotype of h. jecorina rut c <dig>  we first performed a detailed in silico analysis of the encoded putative proteins . most of the orfs could be aligned with proteins of known function, and only three of them encoded completely unknown proteins. two genes encoded cys6zn-type transcription factors, which are only found in fungi  <cit> . however, orthologues of these two transcription factors have not been described in any other fungus yet and their specific functions are therefore not known. the majority of the genes missing in h. jecorina rut c <dig> encoded enzymes involved in primary metabolism , and three transporters . the latter is very similar to a general amino acid permease that was characterized from amanita muscaria  <cit> . four other genes encoded extracellular enzymes . finally, two of the genes missing in h. jecorina rut c <dig> encoded proteins involved in cellular detoxification pathways, namely a multidrug efflux pump and a glutathione s transferase, and gene one encoded a class i reducing polyketide synthase.

* genes 1– <dig> are are missing from h. jecorina rut c30

h. jecorina rut c <dig> is impaired in the assimilation of α-glucans and -glucosides
the presence of a maltose permease in the missing genomic fragment raised the question whether this would have an impact of the growth of h. jecorina rut c <dig> on α-linked glucans and glucosides. as can be seen from fig.  <dig>  growth on dextrin, starch, maltose and maltotriose was indeed strongly impaired in rut c <dig>  which is consistent with the absence of a maltose permease responsible for α-glucoside uptake. this interpretation is supported by the fact that h. jecorina – in contrast to several aspergillus spp. – does not have multiple maltose permease genes  and also lacks an extracellular α-glucosidase  <cit> . the present findings are therefore consistent with a metabolism of α-glucosides in h. jecorina by uptake and intracellular hydrolysis, which is impaired in rut c <dig> 

h. jecorina rut c <dig> displays several alterations in carbon source assimilation
in view of the relatively strong abundance of metabolic genes in the genomic region which is missing in h. jecorina rut c <dig>  we performed a comprehensive analysis of its ability to assimilate  carbon sources using  <dig> carbon sources contained in the biolog phenotype microarrays, and compared it to its wild-type strain qm6a. the data obtained  identified several striking differences: strain rut c <dig> had a strongly impaired growth on l-arabinose, l-erythritol, d-galactose and also 2-keto-d-gluconic acid. interestingly, the opposite effect  was also observed with some other carbon sources, e.g. glycerol, n-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine, d-mannitol, d-fructose, d-trehalose, d-mannose, d-ribose). this strongly reduced growth on l-arabinose, l-erythritol and also d-galactose suggested to us that one of the aldo/keto-reductases identified as lacking in strain rut c <dig>  could be involved in polyol assimilation. in order to test this hypothesis, we prepared cell free extracts from strains qm <dig> and rut c <dig>  and tested these activities in cell-free extracts. as shown table  <dig>  both strains of h. jecorina had high nad+-linked dehydrogenase activities with xylitol, l-arabinitol and erythritol and nadph-linked dehydrogenase activities with d-xylose and l-arabinose as substrates, respectively. activities with the other coenzyme  were negligible, with the exception of some nadp+-linked activity of strain rut c <dig> on xylitol, which was absent from strain qm <dig>  in general, activities in strain rut c <dig> were significantly higher. only the nad+-linked erythritol dehydrogenase activity was similar in both strains. these data indicate that the loss of the three aldo/ketoreductases in rut c <dig> has apparently no effect on its metabolism of the major polyols and therefore cannot explain the different growth pattern of strain rut c <dig> on l-arabinose and l-erythritol

components given in the first row were used as substrates, and the respective activities with nad or nadh are given in the rows under the respective coenzymes and strains. open positions indicate that the experiment has not been done.

h. jecorina rut c <dig> favors high osmotic pressure
the glycerol dehydrogenase gld2; ec  <dig> . <dig> ;  <cit> ), which is lacking in h. jecorina rut c <dig>  has been shown to be involved in glycerol formation during osmoadaptation in a. nidulans  <cit>  and h. atroviridis . we were therefore interested to see whether the loss of glycerol dehydrogenase would render strain rut c <dig> osmotically unstable. we grew strains qm <dig> and rut c <dig> in submerged culture on  <dig> and 10%  glucose. the results are shown in fig. 7a: strain rut c <dig> had a longer lag phase for growth but then accumulated about double the concentration of biomass than strain qm <dig> under both conditions. the conversion yield yx/s on 1%  glucose was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for strain qm <dig> and rut c <dig>  while a yield over  <dig>  can be explained by the utilization of amino acids in peptone for biomass formation  <cit> , these data show that rut c <dig> accumulates biomass more efficiently under both conditions. yields on 10%  glucose were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. this indicated that the loss of glycerol dehydrogenase did not render strain rut c <dig> osmotically labile, but that it even performed better than strain qm <dig> at high osmotic pressure.

spore volume increase during germination in h. jecorina rut c30
in order to learn the reason for the prolonged lag phase in strain rut c <dig>  we microscopically examined the germination of its spores. this analysis revealed that rut c <dig> spores first undergo considerable swelling and increase in size before they start to form a germ tube . while spores of h. jecorina qm <dig> showed a uniform spore diameter of  <dig> –  <dig> μm during spore germination, h. jecorina rut c <dig> spores swelled up to a diameter of  <dig> –  <dig> μm, corresponding to an up to  <dig> – fold increase of spore volume . interestingly, not all rut c <dig> spores showed a swelling response and the extent of the swelling varied, resulting in a relatively homogenous distribution of spore diameters from ca.  <dig> to  <dig> μm. germination was observed from swollen and not swollen spores and osmotic stress  did delay germination but not influence the ratio of swollen to not swollen spores. however, although germination from even extremely swollen spores was observed, apparently not all swollen spores were able to enter the germination phase and during later growth stages a number of large spores that had undergone autophagic cell death  <cit>  could be detected . the spore swelling and autophagy of swollen spores in h. jecorina rut c <dig> could result in a delay of the formation of an interconnected mycelium and therefore explain the observed prolonged lag phase of rut c <dig> 

h. jecorina rut c <dig> lacks pigment formation
an intriguing observation during the cultivation experiments was that strain rut c <dig> does not form the yellow pigment, which is characteristic for h. jecorina and other trichoderma spp. from section longibrachiatum  <cit> . this difference was observed both in late submerged cultures as well as during plate growth. we suspected that this could be due to the absence of the class i polyketide synthase id  <dig>  in order to test this presumption, we subjected its amino acid sequence to phylogenetic analysis  with other polyketide synthases investigated by kroken et al.  <cit> . in this analysis , the h. jecorina polyketide synthase was determined to be member of clade i from the reducing polyketide synthases, thereby clustering most closely to bipolaris mayidis pks <dig>  whose function is not known. since none of the members of this cluster is known to be responsible for pigment formation, but some of them  synthesize antimicrobial polyketides, we also tested whether rut c <dig> would be deficient in formation of an antimicrobial compound. however, using the agar diffusion assay and the confrontation assay, we could not detect any such compound in strain qm <dig> and consequently also not in rut c <dig> . while the use of more sensitive methods such as ms may detect differences in secondary metabolite production between h. jecorina qm6a and rut c <dig>  our data show that the loss of this class i polyketide synthase does not influence the antimicrobial activity of h. jecorina.

h. jecorina ng  <dig> has a full-size cre <dig> but lacks the  <dig> kb fragment
both, h. jecorina rut c <dig> and its ancestor ng  <dig>  are mutants that underwent mutagenesis by nitrosoguanidin and were selected for growth on cellulose in the presence of glycerol  and 2-desoxiglucose . we therefore wondered whether the loss of the  <dig> kb fragment and the truncation of cre <dig> were the result of one or both of these mutation steps.

in order to test the presence of the full-length or the truncated cre <dig> gene in ng  <dig>  we designed primers cref and crer . crer hybridizes in the  <dig>  kb fragment of the cre <dig> locus that is absent in rut c <dig>  and should therefore result in amplification of a  <dig>  kb fragment from the native cre <dig> gene only. using these primers we could amplify the expected pcr product from qm <dig> and ng  <dig> but not from rut c <dig> . on the other hand using primer cref in combination with primer crerutr, binding downstream of the cre <dig> truncation, we amplified a  <dig>  kb fragment corresponding to the truncated cre <dig>  gene from rut c <dig>  whereas the two other strains yielded a larger  fragment corresponding to the native genomic locus . consequently, we conclude that the cre <dig> truncation specifically occurred in h. jecorina rut c <dig> 

in order to test for the presence or absence of the 85-kb gene fragment, which is missing in rut c <dig>  the gene specific primers for orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were used. by means of these primers, we were unable to amplify a pcr product from strains ng  <dig> and rut c <dig>  whereas amplicons were obtained in the control with qm <dig> , indicating that the large chromosome lesion is already present in the ancestor of rut c <dig> 

discussion
in the present work we have shown that the hypercellulolytic mutant h. jecorina rut c <dig>  in which only two mutations  gel is not sensitive enough to distinguish between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp, it is nonetheless possible that more deletions may be present in the genome of rut c <dig> 

the reason for this gene loss in rut c <dig> is unclear. the genealogy leading to mutant rut c <dig> involved three mutagenesis steps from the wild type strain , of which the first one was simple uv mutagenesis whereas the subsequent two  involved mutagenesis by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine  <cit> . however, both agents usually do not lead to chromosome alterations or translocations. the results from genome walking have shown that the 5' site of the deletion is located in a region containing an about  <dig> nt long palindromic at-rich region . patrrs have been found to mediate genomic instability, thereby contributing to translocations, deletions and amplifications  <cit> . carter et al.  <cit>  have speculated that the lack of a sexual cycle and the need for mitotic pairing of chromosomes arising from there may increase the tolerance of mitosporic fungi to chromosome rearrangements. in the light of the above reasoning, patrrs may be preferred regions for this. in n. crassa, this has been shown to be due to escape from het-c incompatibility  <cit> . the possibility that such rearrangements may regularly occur in h. jecorina would be consistent with similar data from other fungi  <cit> , and also be consistent with results from the analysis of the genome of h. jecorina qm6a  <cit>  which revealed a number of gene conversion events. in addition, such events could also occur during the regeneration of protoplasts after transformation with dna , which would explain the high phenotypic diversity in h. jecorina transformants  <cit> . our results with h. jecorina ng  <dig> show that the loss of the  <dig> kb gene fragment already occurred before the origin of rut c <dig>  and such an event must therefore have taken place in this or even an earlier mutant strain.

the structure of the gene encoding the rhodanese-like protein also supports such a scenario: this gene does not have any orthologues in fungi, but shows similarity to flavibacterial rhodanese-like proteins. it is conceivable that this gene arrived by horizontal gene transfer in an instable region, which led to the insertion to this unsual high number  of introns. the gene seems to be active, though, as the database lists  <dig> ests for it.

we were not able to predict the putative function of all genes which have been lost in rut c <dig>  although we could therefore not to relate all of these genes to distinct phenotypic properties, for some of them clear correlations were obtained. one of them was the inability to grow on α-linked oligo- and polysaccharides, which we interpret to be due to the loss of the maltose permease gene . this finding implies that h. jecorina rut c <dig> may not be a good source of enzyme production on carbon sources containing starch and other α-linked glycans, unless this deficiency is complemented by the corresponding gene from qm  <dig> 

another intriguing finding during this study was that the loss of glycerol dehydrogenase gld <dig> does not lead to an impaired osmotolerance. consistent findings have been reported with a gldb-knock out strain of a. nidulans  <cit> , where it was shown that this strain failed to accumulate glycerol during osmotic stress, but instead accumulated other polyols including d-mannitol, l-arabinitol and l-erythritol. it is therefore possible that other polyol dehydrogenase genes of h. jecorina can compensate for the loss of gld <dig>  however, the microscopic findings from this study, i.e. that rut c <dig> displays a significant swelling of its conidia before it starts to germinate, indicate that osmotic homeostasis is impaired in this strain. a possible explanation for this finding would be that the compensating polyols  are less fast metabolized, and thus lead to an increased osmotic pressure in the spores and delayed germination. the carbon source assimilation experiments also revealed that strain rut c <dig> shows an enhanced growth rate on a number of simple carbon sources such as glycerol, n-acetylglucosamine, d-mannitol, d-fructose, d-trehalose, d-mannose, and d-ribose. interestingly, there is evidence that some of them act as catabolite repressing carbon sources in h. jecorina . the phenotype in rut c <dig> may be related to the loss of function of cre <dig>  and be due to the relief of catabolite repression by these carbon sources within their own catabolic pathways, most likely at the level of uptake. sugar permeases of h. jecorina and other mitosporic fungi are known to be repressed by elevated levels of their substrates  <cit> . this property enables strain rut c <dig> to grow faster at high sugar concentrations such as 6% lactose, a condition employed to make use of its superior cellulase forming capacity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified a major genomic alteration in the hypercellulolytic mutant strain h. jecorina rut c <dig>  and have been able to correlate several of them with not yet apparent phenotypes of this strain. likely, insights provided in this paper may only just be the beginning, and further such changes may be found when its genome would be subjected to a more thorough investigation. while the differences between the parent strain and rut c <dig> do not interfere with the use of rut c <dig> in biotechnology for the production of cellulases, it is clear that the use of this strain for basic research in physiology or molecular genetics is flawed. this is especially true for its use as a "carbon catabolite derepressed" mutant, because the truncation in its cre <dig> protein clearly is only one of several more changes compared to its wild-type parent. such a comparison may only be valid, if the results are compared to the mutant strain ng  <dig> in which the cre <dig> truncation has not yet occurred.
