BACKGROUND
sequencing technology is improving fast, with a drastic reduction of its costs  <cit> . these rapid advances have greatly expanded our understanding of human genetic diversity and population history  <cit> , enabling us to investigate variants with health consequences and paving the way to personalized medicine  <cit> . genome wide association studies  have characterized the function of thousands of common snvs, but there are still millions of variants left unexplored  <cit> . therefore, whole genome sequencing is necessary for a detailed study of rare genomic variants. a number of international consortia have started sequencing the whole genomes of large panels, including the  <dig> genomes project , the personal genome project , and the  <dig> malay genomes  <cit> . these consortia, as well as several geographically more restricted projects, aim to understand the functional aspects of both common and unique variants in humans. in the future, we can expect all distinct ethnic groups to have their genomes sequenced.

pakistan lies at a junction of the indian sub-continent in the east, the central asian states in the west, and china towards its north. it has a unique socio-religious-cultural history, in addition to a number of ethnic and linguistic groups such as punjabi, pathan , sindhi, and baloch   <cit> . while a number of these groups have been included in genetic panels typing microsatellites and snps  <cit> , only one male pakistani individual of unknown ethnic origin has been sequenced so far   <cit> . here we report the first whole-genome sequence and analysis of a pathan male . genomic variations including single nucleotide variations , small insertions and deletions , and copy number variation regions  were identified by aligning the pathan genome sequence to the human reference genome . variants were then annotated and scanned for associated functions along with snvs that could modulate drug response. possible deleterious non-synonymous snvs  were investigated for potential effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. additionally, multiple analytical approaches were used to assess the influence of ancestral contributions within the pathan  genome.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and variants identification
dna extracted from blood was sequenced with paired-end reads of 90 bp using the illumina hiseq <dig> sequencer, producing  <dig> , <dig>  reads. a total of  <dig>  gb of sequences were generated and aligned to the human reference genome , covering  <dig> % of the reference genome at an average  <dig> × depth .

we identified a total of  <dig> , <dig> snvs, of which  <dig> , <dig>  were reported in the dbsnp database  <cit>  and  <dig>  were novel  which were further compared with the novel variants count of other individual genomes from literature   <cit> . there were  <dig> , <dig> homozygous and  <dig> , <dig> heterozygous snvs. a total of  <dig>  snvs were found in coding dna sequence  regions,  <dig>  in 3’ untranslated regions , and  <dig>  in 5’ utrs. a total of  <dig>  snvs in  <dig>  genes were non-synonymous .table  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  short indels  were observed, of which  <dig>  were found in intergenic regions,  <dig> in cds regions, and  <dig>  in intron regions. additionally,  <dig>  cnvrs were found,  <dig> of which were classed as duplicated and  <dig> as deleted, affecting  <dig>  overlapped genes . a total of  <dig> cnvrs had not previously been described in the database of genomic variants . figure  <dig> shows the number of gained and lost cnvrs in each chromosome. annovar was used for detailed annotation analysis of cnvrs to identify genes associated with these regions .figure  <dig>

functional classification and clinical relevance of variants
all  <dig>  nssnvs found in the pathan genome were further scrutinized for their possible functional effects using computational prediction methods , resulting in  <dig> nssnvs in  <dig> genes being classified as functionally damaging . additionally, nssnvs were annotated using clinvar for their clinical relevance, and we found that  <dig> coding snvs are associated with several diseases . of particular note are an snv  in the tf gene  <cit> , which affects alzheimer’s susceptibility; ser217leu in elac <dig> gene , which is implicated in genetic susceptibility to hereditary prostate cancer  <cit> . the rate of prostate cancer is low in pakistan   <cit> , as compare to americans and caucasian  <cit> . three coding snvs on ghrlos , serpine <dig> , and pparg  which all have links with obesity  <cit> . about  <dig> % of pakistanis are reported to be obese which is close to european  and united states populations   <cit> .

we also found three pathogenic snvs in genes associated with hair, skin and pigmentation: edar , slc45a <dig> , and tyr   <cit> . in addition, we detected a snv  in abcc <dig>  which is responsible for wet earwax which was also found in the pakistani pk <dig> genome  <cit> .

one of the variants  in the cyp2d <dig> gene is responsible for poor metabolism of debrisoquine, an adrenergic-blocking medication used for the treatment of hypertension  <cit> . also, two snvs in the tpmt  are known to have a pathogenic effect and lead to thiopurine methyltransferase  deficiency  <cit> . moreover two nssnvs  of cyp4a <dig> and ggt <dig> genes in the arachidonic acid metabolism pathway were found . arachidonic acid in the human body usually comes from dietary animal sources, such as meat, eggs, and dairy. meat is an important part of a pathan’s diet, usually consumed at least once a day, often in the form of kabab , or curry  <cit> .

comparative genomic analysis was done using pathan  genome and the other previously published pakistani  genome. non-synonymous variants from pakistani  genome were annotated for investigating associated diseases. out of ~ <dig>  nssnvs only  <dig> variants  were found linked with certain disorders. eight clinically relevant snvs were detected overlapped with pathan  genome. we found no damaged variants responsible for alzheimer’s, obesity and heart related diseases just like we found in pathan  genome. an snv  was observed in pk <dig> genome which is known for wafarin response. moreover, a pathogenic mutation  was seen in the hnf1a gene which may become a cause of diabetes in the pk <dig> individual.

most of the clinically relevant variants adopted in this study were originally described in caucasian populations. while this result might be a consequence of the genomic affinities of the pathan genome with other caucasian populations, it might also reflect a bias due to most of the gwas work being carried out on caucasian populations  <cit> . therefore a cohort study in the pakistani population will be required for authentication.

pharmacogenomics analysis
damaging nssnvs were annotated using pharmgkb and drugbank databases  <cit> . a large number of variants were associated with susceptibility to poisonous drugs, while others nssnv were linked to the efficacy of medicines used in the treatment of diseases such as depression, diabetes mellitus, alzheimer disease, arthritis and so on . after discovering the possibly damaged variants found in sift and polyphen <dig>  the consensus of both datasets was further analyzed in order to find the most probable impact of these deleterious variants in terms of drug targeting, transport, and metabolism. we found nssnvs that affect the function of drugs . a variant rs <dig>  was found associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome when treated with antipsychotics  <cit> . our donor has high chance of having decreased diastolic blood pressure if treated with benazepril  <cit> . one of the variants  was associated with increased risk of toxic liver disease when treated with ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin  <cit> . we also observed an snv  which made this individual use escitalopram for depression and other anxiety  <cit> . the detail list of those drugs can be found in additional file 9: table s <dig> 

comparison with other pathan individuals
we investigated how representative our pathan genome was of that ethnic group by comparing it to another twenty-two pathan individuals in the hgdp-ceph panel  <cit> , which had been typed for ~650 k snvs, together with a further  <dig> individuals from another eight south asian  populations from the same panel. admixture analysis was performed based on  <dig>  snvs . we considered the cluster membership from structure , the pathan  genome composition was within the variability observed within the pathan sample from the hgdp . similarly, in a multi-dimensional scaling  plot, the pathan genome fell within the other pathan individuals . taken together, these two results confirm that the pathan genome presented in this paper is representative of the pathan ethnic group. these results are also in line with the self-reported ancestry of the subject, with all his grandparents coming from afghanistan to khyber pakhtunkhwa .figure  <dig>

mtdna and y-chromosome analyses
the full mitochondrial genome of the pathan individual was generated by mapping its reads to the revised cambridge reference sequence   <cit> . adenine and thymine  content of the genome was  <dig> %, while guanine and cytosine  content was  <dig> %. a total of  <dig> snvs were found in the pathan mitochondrial genome,  <dig> of which had not been previously reported. the variants were then mapped with mitovariome  <cit>  to identify the mitochondrial haplogroup of our pathan individual. a total of  <dig> snvs were diagnostic of the h <dig> haplogroup , which has been argued to be of exclusive caucasian origin, and its marginal occurrence in pathans reflects admixture  <cit> .

the at and gc contents of the y-chromosome were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. a total of  <dig>  snvs were identified, of which  <dig>  were novel. the observed y-chromosomal snvs were annotated as markers for the l <dig> haplotype of clade l. haplogroup l has high frequency in pakistan  as compare to india , turkey  and caucasians   <cit> .

demographic history analysis
we inferred the demographic history of the pathan using the pairwise sequentially markovian coalescent  model  <cit>  , and compared it to a panel of worldwide populations based on a number of hgdp genomes  <cit> . as previously reported, all populations share a similar demographic history between  <dig> million to 200kyr ago. from 200kyr ago to 20kyr ago, the pathan follow a similar trajectory to other asian and european populations, with an inferred effective population size smaller than african populations, reflecting the out of africa bottleneck. over the last 20 k years, the pathan shows an explosion in effective population size, contemporaneous to other eurasian populations but much greater in magnitude. the very large effective population size likely reflects admixture between european and asian lineages giving rise to modern pathans , rather than an actual increase in census sizes.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
here we present, for the first time, the whole genome of a pathan individual from a north-west province  of pakistan. our analysis provides a detailed view of the pathan genome diversity and functional classification of variants and its impact in pharmacogenomics. a large scale analysis of diverse genomes is needed to help researchers around the world in understanding genetic diversity and functional classification of variants along with pharmacogenomic traits and associated drugs that would be use as personalized medicine.
