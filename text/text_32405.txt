BACKGROUND
transcriptional enhancers are characterized by specific chromatin signatures, which differ depending of whether the enhancer is active or not . transcriptional enhancers have been generally identified by studying the genome-wide binding of the acetyl-transferase p <dig>  a ubiquitous enhancer co-activator  <cit> . however, not all p300-bound enhancers show activity  <cit> . enhancers have also been characterized by their chromatin state  <cit> ; and, although the mono-methylation of histone  <dig> lysine  <dig>  has been identified to be an important signature for enhancers  <cit> , this mark is not sufficient for enhancer activation  <cit> . in fact, recent evidence shows that other marks like h3k27ac  and h3k4me <dig>  <cit>  may be necessary for enhancer activity. additionally, the recruitment of rnapii and the concomitant production of enhancer-associated rnas  have also been associated to active enhancers .

although enhancers are typically defined to regulate gene transcription at a distance, about 50 % of potential enhancers predicted by high-throughput methods lie within protein-coding genes  <cit>  and some overlap exons  <cit> . intragenic enhancers can regulate the expression of the host gene  <cit>  or of a nearby gene  <cit> , and have been proposed to act as alternative promoters  <cit> . these results raise the question of how many intragenic enhancers may be active in a cell and whether upon their activation or silencing they may affect the processing of the host gene, possibly by means of local changes of the chromatin state. in this direction, there is evidence that some enhancers upstream of a reporter gene can affect splicing in vitro  <cit> , and that intragenic enhancers bound by argonaute- <dig>  protein can affect the constitutive and alternative splicing of the host gene  <cit> . in this work we describe a computational method to predict active enhancers based on chromatin signals. this method, which uses the relative enrichment of chromatin signals between cell lines to the detect cell specific active enhancers, predicts thousands of intragenic active enhancers. additionally, we find evidence that the differential activation of enhancers inside genes affect the expression and splicing of the host genes. we propose that the activation or silencing of intragenic transcriptional enhancers can modulate the regulation of the host gene through a local change of the chromatin.

methods
datasets
annotated human enhancers with a mouse homologous enhancer that has been experimentally validated were downloaded from vista  <cit> . the gene set was obtained from the 7th release of gencode, human assembly grch <dig> . chip-seq and rna-seq datasets were downloaded from encode  <cit>  for k <dig> and gm <dig> cells. the datasets used were: chip-seq for ctcf, ezh <dig>  p <dig>  rnapii, pu. <dig> , stat <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig>  h3k36me <dig>  h3k79me <dig>  h4k20me <dig> and h2a.z; one control chip-seq experiment and one input experiment; rna-seq for short  and long , polya+ and polya- rnas from whole cell, nucleus and cytosol; and dnasei data for the same cell lines. all datasets were downloaded in the form of mapped reads to the reference hg <dig> genome in bam format.

relative enrichment calculation
we considered sliding windows of 1500 nt along the entire genome, as suggested by the length distribution of experimentally validated enhancers  <cit>  , with a slide shift of 500 nt, resulting in a total of  <dig> , <dig> overlapping windows. in order to avoid mixing enhancer signal with genic and promoter signals, we discarded windows that were closer than 500 nt to an annotated tss. the same approach was applied to intergenic  and intragenic  regions. although there are more intergenic windows  in both cases the amount of windows with signal was similar , which were then kept for further processing. the relative enrichment of chromatin signals between  <dig> cell lines was calculated to predict active enhancers in k <dig>  and silent enhancers in k <dig> . full quantile normalization for counts and gc content was applied using edaseq  <cit> . gc content in each region was calculated as the proportion of g + c in the 1500 nt window. after normalization, the z-score of the relative enrichment of each chip-seq signals between k <dig> and gm <dig> was calculated with pyicoteo  <cit>  using the pyicoenrich function . a vector of z-scores per region was obtained, which we refer to as attributes, consisting of the  <dig> enrichment z-scores for the chip-seq and input datasets. a positive z-score for a region indicates an increased in chip-seq signal in k <dig> relative to gm <dig> in that region, whereas a negative z-score indicates a decreased signal in k <dig> relative to gm12878; and z-scores close to zero indicate no significant differences between the cell lines. for all datasets, except for the chip-seq with non-specific antibody and for the rna-seq datasets, we used replicates. the relative enrichments were calculated with respect to the distribution described by the comparison between replicates. when replicates were not available, these were simulated by pooling the two conditions and dividing them using random sampling  <cit> .

feature selection
feature selection was performed using boruta  <cit> , which finds informative features by measuring the relevance of each attribute with respect to a reference attribute, also called correlation class, and in comparison with a random model extracted from the original dataset. boruta uses the correlation class to evaluate the other features against it using random forests  <cit> . we performed this analysis using as correlation class each of the individual marks . in each case, the correlation was performed  <dig> times using normalized counts on a subset of  <dig> intergenic windows, sampled randomly in each one of the  <dig> iterations. in order to avoid possible biases, in each analysis the correlation class was defined as the chip-seq signal minus the level of input dna. the features used as negative controls were the chip-seq sample for a non-specific antibody   and h4k20me <dig> , which has been associated to transcription repression and heterochromatin but not to enhancer activity  <cit> . running the selection algorithm with the h3k4me <dig> mark, the average boruta score for the control increased notably, suggesting that the mark is present in many regions along the genome .

window clustering
fifteen thousand arbitrary intergenic windows of length 1500 bp were used as seed for the prediction model. various different seed selections of the same size did not change the results significantly. these  <dig>  windows were clustered using mclust  <cit> . mclust is based on finite normal mixture modeling and uses the bayesian information criterion   <cit>  for model optimization. the bic score plateaus at  <dig> clusters for most models . the seed windows corresponded to  <dig> active,  <dig> silent and  <dig>  no-change windows. this indicates that there are mostly three main classes, two that correspond to active and silent enhancers, and a class composed of a gradient of multiple chromatin states, which show little or no relative change of chromatin activity. this is further supported by the uncertainty plot, which shows that regions classified with higher certainty are on the extreme values of the correlation . the final model used for clustering was the centroid type , which creates clusters with variable volume, equal shape, and variable orientation. this model was used to classify the genome-wide 1500 bp windows  using the same clustering method mclust to predict intergenic enhancers. intragenic enhancers were calculated using the same seed of  <dig>  intergenic windows as before. the clustering was performed in the same way as for intergenic enhancers. as controls we calculated  <dig> sets of randomized positions . these sets were calculated from the predicted enhancers by randomizing the positions, not closer than 500 nt to any gene, avoiding gaps, genic regions, and other random locations previously generated, and keeping the same length and the same number of regions . random intragenic enhancers were generated similarly by placing the intragenic enhancers in a random location inside the same gene, avoiding regions of 1 kb around any internal tsss and avoiding other random enhancers previously generated . all predicted intergenic and intragenic enhancers can be visualized in the ucsc genome browser through the link http://regulatorygenomics.upf.edu/projects/enhancers.html.

linking enhancers to genes
enhancers were linked to genes by selecting the closest tss on either direction and by using chia-pet data for rnapii in k <dig> cells for two replicates from encode  <cit> . an enhancer was considered connected to a gene if there were at least  <dig> chia-pet pairs connecting both the predicted enhancer and the region of 1 kb around the tss of the gene. random enhancers used as controls were calculated as described above. for the association of enhancers to genes, only enhancers that were between  <dig> and 100 kb from a tss were considered. genes associated to cancer were obtained from the cancer gene census   <cit> .

expression and splicing analysis
for every gene in gencode  annotation  <cit> , the most upstream tss  and all alternative tsss  were considered. each pair tss1-tss <dig>  tss2-tss <dig>  etc. was considered as an alternative transcription event. rnapii relative enrichment levels were measured around each tss using the same method as before. to control possible association with upstream enhancers, we discarded all alternative tss events that had a predicted intergenic enhancer  100 kb upstream of the gene. we calculated the expression levels of the annotated transcript isoforms using cufflinks v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with parameters --library-type fr-firststrand --no-effective-length-correction --min-frags-per-transfrag  <dig> and masking all rrnas, trnas and mitochondrial sequences. the relative changes in transcript abundance were obtained using cuffdiff with parameters --library-type fr-firststrand --min-reps-for-js-test  <dig>  using the merged gtf file obtained from cufflinks for gm <dig> and k <dig>  along with the bam files of gm <dig> and k <dig> with replicates. this provided  <dig> genes  with relative changes in expression between the two cell lines.

alternative splicing events from the gencode v <dig> annotation  <cit>  were calculated using the software suppa . only events that do not overlap any other alternative splicing event were kept, giving rise to a total of  <dig> events. for exon skipping events, defined by an exon triple e1–e2–e <dig>  the inclusion level  of the middle exon e <dig>  was calculated as the fraction of reads that include the exon over the total number of reads that include and skip the exon: psi=n12+n23n12+n23+2n <dig> where n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig> are the number of reads that span the junctions e1–e <dig>  e2–e <dig> and e1–e <dig>  respectively. psi values were calculated using junction reads only, since enhancers can produce rna as well, so the enhancer-related rnas may be mistakenly included in the psi calculation when they overlap an event. reads at junctions were counted with sjcount  <cit>  from the mapped rna-seq data, using the -read <dig>  <dig> and -read <dig>  <dig> parameters. for this analysis, rna-seq reads were mapped using star  <cit>  with parameters --outsjfilteroverhangmin − <dig> - <dig> - <dig> - <dig> and --sjdbscore  <dig> in order to use only annotated junctions. a genome index was previously generated with star over the gencode.v <dig> annotation using the --sjdboverhang  <dig> parameter in order to adjust the splice junction database to the length of the rna-seq reads. finally, only events with a total of  <dig> or more reads mapping at the junctions were kept. this gave a final number of  <dig> and  <dig> events with psi values from the nuclear and cytosolic rna-seq experiments, respectively.

we defined the events to be regulated if they had |delta psi| >  <dig>  in at least one replicate comparison between cell lines. using two pairings of the replicates, this gave rise to  <dig> and  <dig> events  with the cytosolic samples, and  <dig> and  <dig>  for the nuclear samples. additionally, we defined a set of alternative events that do not change splicing by imposing |delta psi| <  <dig>  between the same replicate comparisons used before. this gave rise to  <dig> and  <dig>  for the cytosolic samples, and  <dig> and  <dig>  for the nuclear samples.

RESULTS
modeling and prediction of active transcriptional enhancers
we built a computational predictive model based on the relative differences in various chromatin marks between two cellular conditions. we applied this model to study the differences between the encode cell lines k <dig>  a leukemia cell line, and gm <dig>  a blood cell derived cell line. using windows along the entire genome , we considered the relative enrichment of a number of histone marks and protein factors . we then clustered windows into classes according to the chromatin features. in order to determine which features are relevant for classification, we performed a feature selection analysis in which one signal is chosen as a proxy for a classification value and is compared against the rest . we then considered two of the main epigenetic marks related to active enhancers, h3k27ac  <cit>  and h3k4me <dig>  <cit> , as proxies for enhancer activity. we found that h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig>  observed to be present in active and non-active enhancers  <cit>  are strongly correlating signals . we also consistently found h2a.z, which is a histone variant associated to open chromatin and h3k <dig> methylation  <cit> ; and p <dig>  which is ubiquitously present in enhancers  <cit> .fig.  <dig> a predictive model of active enhancers. a feature selection using h3k27ac  as a correlation class. the bars represent the average importance score per feature. red labels and bars indicate the minimum , mean  and maximum  of the simulated replicates, as well as the chip-seq with a non-specific antibody . the red dashed line separates the relevant features  from the non-relevant features . b scatter plot of the intergenic windows according to relative enrichment z-scores for every pair of selected features . each dot represents a window and windows are separated according to the three classes: active enhancers , no-change regions  silent enhancers . the black centroids show the centers and standard deviations of the correlations between different features



interestingly, when p <dig> or h3k4me <dig> were used as a correlation feature, the signals h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> did not appear as the most significantly associated . additionally, p <dig> seemed to associate with the largest subset of features, which is consistent with experimental evidence showing that p <dig> associates generally to enhancers  <cit> . however, enhancers with h3k4me <dig> and/or p <dig> occupancy are not always active  <cit> , since h3k4me <dig> precedes enhancer-binding factors and p <dig> may be present in poised and intermediate enhancer states  <cit> . on the other hand, we did not find rnapii and h3k36me <dig> to be strong predictors of enhancer activity , even though they have been previously detected on enhancers  <cit> . additionally, although we found a strong correlation of pu. <dig>  with h3k27ac, it does not correlate with h3k4me <dig>  hence it is likely that pu. <dig> associates to a subset of the putative enhancers  <cit> . based on these results, we decided to keep those features that scored consistently above the technical and biological controls in the feature selection analysis using h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> as correlation classes, including these two marks. that is, we used as predictors of enhancer activity the following signals: p <dig>  h3k27ac, h3k9ac, h3k4me1/me2/me <dig> and h2a.z.

clustering the genomic windows according to the relative enrichment of the selected features  resulted in three optimal classes . we recovered one class characterized for being enriched in h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac , which we considered to be enhancers that are active in k <dig> cells . we recovered a second class characterized by a depletion of these same marks in k <dig> , which we considered to be active enhancers in gm <dig> . finally, the third cluster showed small or no changes in most of the signals, indicating that these regions do not have any differential activity between the two cell lines. these regions do not necessarily represent enhancers and are labeled as no-change. these three groups  define the three predictable classes of our computational model, two of which can be identified with enhancer classes: active and silent. the genome wide classification analysis resulted in  <dig>  windows predicted to be active in k <dig>  and  <dig>  windows predicted to be active in gm <dig> .

in-silico validation of active transcriptional enhancers
in order to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions, we first compared our predicted enhancers windows with the enhancer regions predicted in the same cell lines by chromhmm  <cit> . the majority of our enhancers predicted as active in k <dig> or gm <dig> overlap with chromhmm windows labeled as weak or strong enhancers in the same cells . on the other hand, when we compared active windows with chromhmm labels in the other cell line, the majority corresponds to chromhmm silent windows , as expected. furthermore, the overlap of our active enhancers with predicted chromhmm enhancers increases with the posterior probability of our predictions . in contrast, when comparing the active enhancers in one cell line with the chromhmm labels from the other cell line, we found no correlation with the posterior probability . based on these comparisons, we kept predictions with a posterior probability of >  <dig> , which resulted in  <dig>  active windows in k <dig> and  <dig>  active windows in gm <dig>  overlapping windows were then clustered into  <dig>  active enhancers in k <dig> and  <dig>  active enhancers in gm <dig>  which distribute evenly along the genome . these enhancers have mean length of 3053 bp and the majority of them  are shorter than 5 kb . there were also  <dig>  predictions longer than 10 kb, which may correspond to large-scale chromatin domains  <cit>  or to clusters of enhancers  <cit> . we filtered out those predictions longer than 5 kb, resulting in  <dig>  active enhancers and  <dig> silenced enhancers, with mean lengths of  <dig>  and 2588 bp, , respectively. these average lengths are in agreement with previous analyses of enhancers from chip-seq data of histone marks and protein factors  <cit> .

we next studied the association of enhancers to other signals not considered in the predictive model. pu. <dig> and rnapii correlate with the predicted active enhancers, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the active enhancers in k <dig> showing a significant relative enrichment  in pu. <dig>  and rnapii , respectively. similarly, we found a strong association of dnasei to our predicted enhancers, in agreement with previous observations  <cit>  and  <dig>  % of the active and silent enhancers show a significant enrichment  . likewise,  <dig>  % of the silent enhancers in k <dig>  show a significant depletion in dnasei . in contrast, h3k27me <dig> shows a weak inverse correlation with enhancer activity and  <dig>  % of the silent enhancers in k <dig> show a significant enrichment  of h3k27me <dig> . although ctcf and h3k36me <dig> have been detected before on enhancers  <cit> , we observed a weak correlation of these signals with enhancer activity and only  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of active enhancers in k <dig> show a significant enrichment in ctcf and h3k36me <dig>  respectively .fig.  <dig> properties of predicted intergenic enhancers. relative enrichment of pu. <dig> , dnasei  and polyadenylated long  nuclear rna  at active and silent enhancers, as well as for regions of no-change in chromatin. the violin plots describe the distributions for the z-score of the relative enrichment along the y-axis. positive z-score values mean enrichment in k <dig>  while negative z-scores mean enrichment in gm <dig>  d percentage of enhancers at a given distance from the tss, for active , silent , as well as for the corresponding randomized sets  . e relative expression change in genes associated to enhancers by proximity to the tss. the violin plot describes the distributions of z-scores of the relative enrichment of rpkm values along the y-axis for genes associated to active and silent enhancers, as well as for no-change regions calculated with pyicoteo  <cit> . genes where linked to the nearest enhancers within a distance range between  <dig> and 10 kb. f cumulative distribution of enhancer nearby genes related to cancer in terms of the distance between the tss and the closest enhancer. the comparison is made between active and silent predicted enhancers, and the corresponding randomizations



we additionally investigated whether enhancer-associated rnas  are found in our predictions. enhancer activity correlates with the production of polya+  and polya-  long  nuclear rnas, compared to silent enhancers. this relative enrichment is much larger than for the other rna subclasses . interestingly, there is also enrichment of cytosolic polya+ rnas , but not of cytosolic polya- rnas  or short rnas  . moreover, not all enhancers predicted as active appear to generate ernas:  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the predicted active enhancers in k <dig> have a significant  increase of nuclear polya+ and polya-, respectively. in comparison, only  <dig>  % of active enhancers have significant  increase for short nuclear rnas. for cytosolic polya+,  <dig>  % of the predicted active enhancers in k <dig> have a significant  increase of ernas. in contrast, only  <dig>  % of these active enhancers have a significant enrichment of short total rnas and polya- cytosolic rnas, respectively.

although enhancers can regulate genes from afar, they tend to be enriched upstream of genes . we therefore connected enhancers to genes by choosing for each enhancer the closest annotated transcription start site  in either direction. with this approximation, active intergenic enhancers show enrichment at distances close to tsss compared to random regions and to silent enhancers . using these enhancer-tss pairs, we calculated the relative change in gene expression measured from rna-seq data . we observed that genes with activated enhancers at a distance between  <dig> and 10 kb show up-regulation, whereas genes with silenced enhancers in the same distance range show down-regulation . moreover, this association is conserved when the distance range of the enhancers is extended to be between  <dig> and 100 kb from the closest gene . further support for transcription activity in association to our predicted enhancers was found measuring the relative density of rnapii around the tss in genes close to predicted enhancers, which was found to correlate with enhancer activity .

we additionally searched for evidence of direct physical interactions for the enhancer-tss pairs calculated above by using chia-pet data for rnapii  <cit> . although only a small fraction of active enhancers have chia-pet links to tss regions , there is enrichment over silent enhancers and randomized regions , indicating that predicted active enhancers tend to have more chia-pet links than silent enhancers and expected by chance. finally, we investigated whether enhancers active in k <dig> have any association to genes that have been involved in cancer. using the cancer gene census  <cit> , we found that enhancers predicted to be active in k <dig> are enriched for genes related to cancer, compared to random regions and to enhancers silent in k <dig>  . interestingly, oncogenes can be linked more frequently to active enhancers and suppressors can be linked more frequently to silent enhancers . in summary, these analyses indicate that our predicted enhancers show properties of active enhancers. we therefore set out to predict intragenic enhancers using the same computational model.

thousands of intragenic enhancers are differentially activated in human cells
active enhancers regulating the expression of nearby genes have been observed in exons  <cit>  and about 50 % of enhancers predicted by high-throughput methods lie within protein-coding genes  <cit> . additionally, by comparing the overlap of validated vista elements with the annotation in gencode.v <dig>  <cit> , we observe that there is no preference for intragenic or intergenic regions . all these evidences indicate that intragenic enhancers represent an important regulatory component of the genome. however, it remains an open question how many intragenic enhancers may be active in a given cell. accordingly, we decided to apply our predictive model to localize putative intragenic enhancers that are activated in k <dig> relative to gm <dig>  and vice versa.

in order to predict intragenic active enhancers, we considered  <dig>  kb sliding windows inside genes, starting 500 bp downstream of the first tss and eliminating all windows that overlap with a 1 kb region around every annotated alternative tss . this resulted in an initial set of  <dig> , <dig> possible  <dig>  kb windows, for which we used the same selected chromatin features as for the intergenic enhancers. using a seed of  <dig>  intergenic regions and the same clustering approach as before, we predicted  <dig>  active and  <dig>  silenced regions. as we did previously with intergenic enhancers, we compared our predicted intragenic predictions with chromhmm predictions with similar results . accordingly, we only kept windows predicted with posterior probability >  <dig> , resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  active intragenic enhancer windows in k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively. after clustering overlapping windows, we obtained  <dig>  active intragenic enhancers in k <dig>  and  <dig>  active intragenic enhancers in gm <dig> , falling inside a total of  <dig> genes  and  <dig>  genes, respectively. the mean length of these predictions is 3665 bp, with the majority  being shorter than 5 kb . as before, we kept those shorter than 5 kb, resulting in  <dig>  and  <dig>  candidate active intragenic enhancers in k <dig> and gm <dig>  respectively.

our predicted intragenic enhancers tend to occur in separate genes, with only  <dig>  % of the genes hosting enhancers of both types. the majority of intragenic enhancers active in k <dig>  or active in gm <dig>  fall in intronic regions, and  <dig>  % in k <dig>  overlap at least partially with an exon. however, comparing the proportion of exonic and intronic regions covered by enhancers with the actual proportions of these regions in genes, we find no preference for exons or introns . additionally, even though we observed a preference for intragenic enhancers to fall on the first intron , this effect can be explained by the fact that first introns are on average longer in human   <cit> .

intragenic enhancers affect the regulation of the host gene
as the activation or silencing of intragenic transcriptional enhancers are characterized by the differential density of chromatin marks, we hypothesized that this would lead to a modulation of the rna processing of the host gene. to test this, we first measured whether genes hosting predicted enhancers tend to show significant differential expression between the two cell lines. similarly as before for enhancers linked to genes, we find a correlation of the relative expression change of genes hosting active or silenced enhancers. specifically,  <dig>  % of  <dig> genes with only active enhancers in k <dig>  show a significant expression up-regulation in the corresponding cell line . we then tested whether the activation or silencing of internal enhancers may produce the activation or repression of an intragenic tss. we considered all active and silenced enhancers that fall between the most upstream tss  and the first internal annotated tss , such that the distance tss1-tss <dig> was longer than 20 kb. this resulted in a total of  <dig> tss1-tss <dig> pairs, from which  <dig>  had at least one active enhancer in k <dig> and  <dig>  had at least one silent enhancer in k <dig>  located between both tsss. when an active enhancer is present between the two alternative tsss, we observed that generally both tss <dig> and tss <dig> show an increase in rnapii density in k <dig> relative to gm <dig> . this suggests that activation of an intragenic enhancer can affect both tsss. conversely, when a silent enhancer is present between both tsss, the relative level of rnapii tend to decrease at both tsss relative to the other cell line . interestingly, this effect persists for other downstream alternative tss events , indicating that intragenic enhancers can activate internal tsss, but also affect transcription of the most upstream tss to some extent. we further used chia-pet for rnapii in k <dig> to validate a possible direct interaction between our intragenic enhancers and the first tss of each gene. similarly as before, we observe a higher density of chia-pet links for active enhancers than for silent and random ones . in this case  <dig>  % of the active intragenic enhancers have chia-pet links, compared to  <dig>  % in silent,  <dig>  % in random active and  <dig>  % in random silent . this enrichment with respect to intergenic enhancers could be due to a higher density of rnapii sites in intragenic regions. as an example of the described mechanism, we show the example of the gene maged <dig>  a member of the melanoma antigen family d, which is known to have tumor-suppressor properties  <cit> . we predict an enhancer that is silent in k <dig> and active in gm <dig>  and is located between a distant tss and an alternative downstream tss . the activation of this enhancer co-occurs with the expression of the downstream first exon in gm <dig> cells, whereas the silencing of the enhancer co-occurs with lack of expression of this exon in k <dig> cells . the rna-seq data suggests that the activation of this enhancer affects more strongly the usage of the tss that is downstream.fig.  <dig> intragenic enhancers and differential transcript expression. relative enrichment z-scores of rnapii on the most upstream tss   and the second tss   when there is an active  or silent  enhancer between both tsss and it sits at a minimum distance of 1000 nt from either one. the yellow violin plots in the middle represent the z-score distribution of all tss1-tss <dig> pairs, with or without predicted enhancers and the dashed green line represents the median value of this distribution. c a tss1-tss <dig> event in gene maged <dig> with a silent enhancer in k <dig> close to tss <dig> . the black boxes indicate the intragenic 1500 nt windows analyzed to search for enhancers. dark green boxes indicate the significant windows and light green indicates the candidate silent enhancer. rna-seq data from k <dig> and gm <dig> cell lines  is shown below, together with the h3k27ac and dnase i hypersensitive sites tracks from encode. the long intron separating the two tsss is cut in the middle for simplicity



the change in chromatin state induced by the activation or silencing of an enhancer may affect the processing of the pre-mrna. there is evidence that localized intragenic chromatin states can produce changes in alternative splicing through various mechanisms . moreover, we have recently shown that active enhancers recruit argonaute proteins to regulate the splicing of the host gene  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that intragenic enhancers that are active in a cell line relative to the other one may in general be associated with relative differences in the inclusion level of nearby exons relative to the two same cell lines. to test this, we measured for all genes the variation in splicing between k <dig> and gm <dig> using cytosolic and nuclear rna-seq polya+ data from encode, using only junction-reads, to avoid contributions from rnas stemming from overlapping enhancers . we found that around 4 % of multi-exonic genes with intragenic enhancers that are active in either cell line, have a regulated alternative splicing event  between both cell lines, whereas only about 1 % of all the genes without intragenic enhancers have a calculated alternative splicing event that changes between cell lines . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> genes with no change in expression have active or silent enhancers, respectively, and  <dig> of these genes have enhancers of both types . moreover,  <dig> of the genes with no change in expression have regulated events, and overlap with a total of  <dig> enhancers  . moreover, these genes contain  <dig> of the  <dig>  cassette events regulated between k <dig> and gm <dig> . using gorilla  <cit> , we tested whether genes with enhancers and regulated events were enriched for any particular gene ontology term, and found an overrepresentation of genes encoding dna-binding proteins implicated in gene regulation and chromatin organization  .fig.  <dig> effect of intragenic enhancers on splicing. a from the  <dig> genes found to have active enhancers,  <dig> of them have regulated events. from the  <dig> genes with active and silent enhancers,  <dig> have regulated events, and from  <dig> genes with silent enhancers,  <dig> have regulated events. b enriched gene ontology processes in the genes with active or silent enhancers and with regulated events, compared to genes with intragenic enhancers but no regulated events . c example of a regulated alternative splicing event in the gene macf <dig>  the cassette exon shows increased inclusion in k <dig> with delta-psi =  <dig>  . two active enhancers are predicted in k <dig> in the area of the regulated exon . intragenic scanned windows are indicated as black boxes, and significant windows are dark red boxes. one of the predicted enhancer regions shows binding of pu. <dig> in k <dig>  but no biding in gm <dig> . rna-seq data from k <dig> and gm <dig> cell lines  is shown below, together with the h3k27ac and dnase i hypersensitive sites tracks from encode



we next decided to evaluate whether there is any association between the presence of enhancers and regulated events in genes. to this end, we compared only genes that have one or more of the  <dig> calculated alternative splicing events  and separated these genes according to whether they have one or more regulated events  or not  between the two cell lines. we found that in all comparisons the proportion of genes with regulated events was higher for those genes that have active enhancers  , being the comparison statistically significant  for both replicates for genes with active enhancers in gm <dig>  using nuclear rna-seq for the calculation of psi values; whereas the same association for enhancers active in k <dig> was only significant for one of the replicate comparisons  . moreover, these associations remained significant when we considered only those genes that do not change expression between both cell lines . the regulated events in genes with active or silent intragenic enhancers present equal proportions of each pattern of psi change, i.e. increase or decrease psi , which is consistent with the observed dual effect that a chromatin change can have on splicing  <cit> . additionally, the direction of change of psi does not correlate with the position, upstream or downstream, of the enhancer relative to the regulated exon . remarkably, the majority of the regulated events are located 5000 nt from an enhancer . however, we did not find any significant difference with the distribution of distances of non-regulated events to nearby enhancers .

as an example, we show the case of a regulated exon in the microtubule-actin crosslinking factor  <dig> gene  . we observe a cassette exon with increased inclusion  in k <dig> cells. the regulated exon is flanked by two enhancers predicted to be active in k <dig>  one of which shows binding of pu. <dig> in k <dig>  but not in gm <dig> . this, together with the rest of our findings, suggests that the binding of pu. <dig> to a nearby enhancer, possibly in combination with other factors, could control the inclusion of this exon in macf <dig>  macf <dig> has been implicated in the wnt signalling pathway  <cit>  and the inclusion of a cassette exon in macf <dig> was observed before to be associated to lung adenocarcinoma  <cit> . this result suggests the interesting possibility that the binding of pu. <dig> to an enhancer inside the macf <dig> gene may affect its splicing, thereby altering wnt signaling and contributing to the oncogenic transformation associated to pu. <dig>  <cit> . in conclusion, we have found a possible association between the activity of intragenic enhancers and the regulation of the pre-mrna. in particular, we find evidence that the activation of intragenic enhancers, besides affecting the activity of internal tsss, can also potentially influence the inclusion of nearby exons.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel semi-supervised method that exploits the relative enrichment and depletion of multiple signals from chip-seq experiments to predict enhancers that are active in one cell line relative to another. applying this method to encode data we predicted a total of  <dig>  enhancers that are active in k <dig> relative to gm <dig>  and  <dig>  enhancers that are active gm <dig> relative to k <dig> , including intragenic and intergenic enhancers.

the number of active enhancers is cell type specific and very much dependent on the method used to detect them  <cit> . although activation of enhancers is generally associated to a number of histone modifications, only a small fraction of the many candidate enhancers previously identified using a variety of techniques may be active in a given cell. for instance, heintzman et al. found  <dig>  putative enhancers in k <dig> cells with approximately 20 % of them overlapping putative enhancers detected in hela cells  <cit> . in contrast, chromhmm  <cit>  predicts more than  <dig>  non-abutting genomic regions to be strong enhancers and about three times as many for weak enhancers. there are two main reasons for the discrepancies with our predicted number of active enhancers: the resolution of the genome segmentation is very different and we only predict enhancers that are active in one condition but not in the other. that is, we do not detect enhancers active or silent in both cell types. nonetheless, we found a good agreement between the regions we predict as active or silent enhancers and the annotations from chromhmm for the same cell lines.

our predicted enhancers are h3k27ac dependent and are defined almost entirely by chromatin signals. the relevant predictive features confirm that active enhancers are characterized not only by the presence of h3k4me <dig>  but also by the presence of h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig> and rnapii  <cit> . we also observed that active enhancers show an enrichment of the histone variant h2a.z, which has been identified to demarcate regulatory regions  <cit> . in contrast, ctcf and ezh <dig> and the histone marks h3k36me <dig> and h4k20me <dig> do not seem to play any prominent role in enhancer activation. h3k27me <dig> is the only feature that shows a pattern of depletion in active enhancers and enrichment in silent enhancers, but mainly in long enhancer-like regions , which may be related to other regulatory mechanisms. we additionally found that predicted enhancer activity correlates strongly with production of long nuclear rnas, rather than short ones, which can be polya+ as well as polya-. however, we observe that not all active enhancers produce ernas. furthermore, although rnapii and h3k36me <dig> have been detected on enhancers in relation to erna production  <cit> , we did not find them as strong predictors of enhancer activity.

when we applied the same predictive model to predict intragenic enhancers, we found a similar number of active intragenic enhancers as for intergenic ones. this result suggests that there exist in cells a considerable number of differentially activated intragenic enhancers, which may have a relevant contribution to the mechanisms of cell-specific gene regulation. since active enhancers are characterized by a local modification of the chromatin state, we hypothesized that our predictions could be linked to relative differences between the same two cell lines in expression and splicing. we observed that intragenic transcriptional enhancers, upon activation or silencing, affect the activity of downstream alternative transcription start sites. surprisingly, they can also affect the most upstream tss. this generalizes previous findings indicating that intragenic enhancers can act as internal alternative promoters  <cit> . we also found that intragenic enhancers, upon activation or silencing, associate to the differential inclusion of nearby exons. however, a considerable proportion of splicing changes occur in genes that change expression . this indicates that the main effect of the activation of enhancers may be related to the activation of alternative transcription in the gene and alternative splicing may be a byproduct of that. the observed changes may be mediated by the changes in the rnapii elongation produced due to the chromatin change. however, active intragenic enhancers show enrichment in open chromatin marks  that have not been associated before to changes in rnapii elongation.

on the other hand, we found here a strong association of pu. <dig>  to active enhancers in k <dig> cells and in particular, a significant increase in pu. <dig> occupancy in  <dig>  % of active enhancers. pu. <dig> has been shown before to be an essential co-factor for enhancer activity  <cit>  and is known to bind to h3k4me <dig> sites in macrophages and b cells in a cell-specific manner  <cit> . moreover, pu. <dig> has been observed to regulate alternative splicing from the promoter  <cit>  and can interact with the rna binding proteins fus  and nono   <cit> . in fact, pu. <dig> has been proposed to bind rna  <cit>  and to perform an antagonistic function to the rna binding proteins tls and nono in the regulation of splicing  <cit> . in this direction, we found enrichment of regulated events in genes with enhancers, which suggests that pu. <dig> could be regulating the splicing of some of these genes through its binding to intragenic enhancers, possibly interacting with rna binding proteins  <cit> . in support of this model, we find that there is an enrichment of regulated events in genes with enhancers that are active or silent relative to the other cell line. we postulate that intragenic enhancers provide localized and cell-type specific mechanisms to link the chromatin state to rna processing.

in summary, there is increasing evidence that changes in the chromatin state can affect the processing of the pre-mrna  and different models for this regulation have been proposed. from our analysis a picture emerges whereby localized chromatin changes inside genes can take place by means of the activation of intragenic transcriptional enhancers. we propose that the differential activation and silencing of transcriptional enhancers that fall within genes could explain the localized chromatin variation that have been observed before to affect the expression and splicing of genes, either through the modulation of rnapii activity or through the recruitment of factors that can interfere with rna processing, like pu. <dig>
