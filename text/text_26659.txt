BACKGROUND
one key question in evolutionary biology deals with the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during allopatric speciation . johns and avise  <cit>  estimated the average mitochondrial dna -based genetic distance between congeneric species in amphibians to be >  <dig>  my, suggesting absence of natural hybridization in taxa of that age. a few major results on intrinsic reproductive isolation in anurans come from artificial hybridization experiments. sasa et al.  <cit>  reported hybrid sterility or inviability in  <dig> frog species to be positively correlated with nei's genetic distance . measuring albumin distances among  <dig> species pairs, wilson et al.  <cit>  showed that frogs could still produce viable hybrids with an average immunological distance of  <dig> % . using blair's  <cit>  crossing experiments in bufo, malone & fontenot  <cit>  showed the hatching success, the number of larvae produced, and the percentage of tadpoles reaching metamorphosis to be inversely related with genetic divergence, some metamorphosing offspring being still produced with a distance of 8% . all of these laboratory data suggest that reproductive isolation increases gradually with phylogenetic distance, presumably driven by complex genomic processes rather than by a few speciation genes, and that very large time scales  are required to achieve hybrid infertility or inviability.

under natural conditions, however, reproductive isolation could arise much earlier than detected in the laboratory. in frogs, as in many other taxa, "surveys of natural hybrid zones  in the field are needed to complement laboratory-based studies to establish the significance and strength of specific barriers in nature"  <cit> . little is known about secondary contact in allopatrically diverged lineages of anurans, where reproductive isolation may quickly arise as a result of reinforcement  <cit> , in addition to genetic drift and local adaptation. extant studies of contact zones in anurans have mostly focused on hybrid fitness  <cit>  or on mechanisms of pre- or post-mating isolation  <cit> . such studies classically relied on allozymes  or  nuclear and mitochondrial dna markers , but often lack any molecular-based estimates of divergence times, which are at best inferred from geological information. some phylogeographic studies include molecular-based estimates of divergence time , but very few have combined such estimates with multi-locus transect approaches to infer the time required to reach reproductive isolation in natural contexts .

the current study focuses on palearctic green toads . after range-wide phylogeographic analyses, secondary contact zones of clades were predicted  <cit> , in which possible hybridization can be examined using fast evolving molecular markers. to do this, we recently developed microsatellites for two west-mediterranean species  <cit> : b. balearicus , and b. siculus . using a bayesian-coalescence approach , divergence time for the two species was estimated to late pliocene , with a range from the early pliocene  to pleistocene   <cit> . a single record of italian mainland-origin b. balearicus in north-eastern sicily  <cit>  suggests their recent  invasion into sicily, where they may secondarily meet the endemic b. siculus.

in this work, we combined mitochondrial and nuclear intronic sequences with multilocus microsatellite markers to examine  whether b. siculus and b. balearicus meet each other in north-eastern sicily,  if so, whether these two closely related species hybridize, and  in such a case, what are the patterns of hybridization. in parallel, we conducted limited and preliminary experimental crosses to help interpreting field data.

RESULTS
nuclear and mitochondrial dna sequences and mitotyping
both of the phylogenetic trees built from mitochondrial  and nuclear  dna sequences show two highly homogeneous and strongly distinct clades , corresponding to b. balearicus and b. siculus. the tropomyosine tree displays a clear geographic pattern: the balearicus clade includes all individuals from mainland italy  and north-eastern sicily, southwards to population  <dig> , while the siculus clade includes individuals from western and southern sicilian populations, from population  <dig>  south-westwards. this pattern points to a very narrow contact zone separating populations  <dig> and  <dig>  between the mount etna and the ionian coast .

sexes were only determined in a subset of adults .

the mtdna clades also show a clear geographic signal, with however, some overlap. populations from mainland italy  and north-eastern sicily  present only balearicus haplotypes, and populations from western and southern sicily  only siculus, but haplotypes from both clades are found in populations  <dig> to  <dig>  around the contact zone identified with tropomyosine.

these phylogenetic trees also provide evidence for past hybridization, as revealed by cytonuclear disequilibria : one individual from pop.  <dig> possesses balearicus tropomyosine alleles but a siculus mtdna-haplotype, while three individuals from pop.  <dig> present siculus tropomyosine alleles but balearicus mtdna haplotypes.

these patterns of mitochondrial distribution were widely confirmed by larger-scale mitotyping . all populations on the apennine peninsula  and four populations  from the north-east of sicily presented only b. balearicus haplotypes. all populations from western and southern sicily  and the two islands off the coast of western sicily  presented only b. siculus haplotypes. in the three populations east of mount etna , both b. balearicus and b. siculus haplotypes were present, with a marked north-south cline : the frequency of balearicus haplotypes declined from  <dig> % in calatabiano  to 68% in giarre  and 50% in gravina , down to 0% in misterbianco .

mtdna: numbers and percentages of individuals containing either b. balearicus or b. siculus mtdna. nuclear dna: numbers and percentages of individuals assigned by structure to either b. balearicus or to b. siculus. hybrids based on: potential hybrids detected using a) newhybrids software, b) diagnostic microsatellite alleles or c) cyto-nuclear disequilibrium.

autosomal microsatellites and population-genetics analyses
there was no evidence for allelic dropout from any locus in any population. null alleles at low frequencies were detected  in one population each for loci c <dig>  and d <dig> , and in two populations each for loci c <dig> , c <dig>  and d <dig> . tests for linkage disequilibrium between loci  revealed four significant combinations . a few b. siculus populations showed some heterozygote deficit , presumably due to sampling design .

bayesian clustering assignment using structure  <cit>  largely confirmed the nuclear information from tropomyosine. all populations from sicily were clearly grouped into two clusters  corresponding to b. balearicus and b. siculus gene pools respectively . all individuals from populations  <dig> to  <dig> were assigned to b. balearicus, while all individuals from populations  <dig> to  <dig> were assigned to b. siculus. ten f1-hybrids from an experimental cross between a female balearicus  and a male siculus  were correctly assigned a 50% probability of belonging to either balearicus or siculus . surprisingly, the two populations north and south of the contact zone  did not show any sign of hybridization or gene flow, despite harboring mtdna from both clades. all individuals from population  <dig> were assigned with a 100% probability to balearicus, and all individuals from the population  <dig> with 100% probability to siculus. as a matter of fact, potential hybrids appear very few , and largely backcrossed .

this pattern was confirmed by newhybrids  <cit> , which, when including all sicilian populations, correctly assigned all experimental crosses as f1-hybrids, and identified four wild-caught individuals as possible f2-hybrids . when focusing on populations where hybrids occurred or were likely to do so , while pre-assigning pop.  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> as pure b. balearicus and b. siculus, respectively, no nuclear hybrids were detected. finally, diagnostic alleles also suggested faint signs of past hybridizations . we found b. siculus alleles in three individuals assigned as b. balearicus using structure , and b. balearicus alleles in six individuals assigned as b. siculus . all of these analyses concur to suggest limited events of nuclear introgression.

in order to fine-tune our analysis of potential gene flow, we performed separate structure analyses for b. balearicus and b. siculus populations. substructure within b. balearicus was best explained with k =  <dig> . cluster b <dig> contained individuals from mainland italy, cluster b <dig> individuals from north-eastern sicilian populations, and cluster b <dig> individuals from populations close to the contact zone. interestingly population  <dig>  showed admixture of mainland italy and sicilian genotypes. substructure within b. siculus was similarly best explained with k =  <dig> . cluster s <dig> contained individuals from the vast majority of populations , except for populations  <dig> and  <dig>  and population  <dig> at the contact zone .

hence, in both species, the populations close to the hybrid zone  form a cluster of their own. however, this pattern is clearly not generated by nuclear gene flow between the two species. indeed, from pair-wise fst values, the strongest differentiation  actually occurs between the two populations  from each side of the contact zone, as compared to an average value of  <dig>  between allospecific populations . this unexpected result was confirmed by a principal component analysis  aimed at extracting factors maximizing genetic differentiation among populations . two factors turn out to be significant, explaining respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total differentiation . the first one accounts for the contrast between b. siculus  and b. balearicus . the three b. balearicus clusters identified with structure differentiate along this axis, with lowest values for b <dig> , and highest values for b <dig> . the three b. siculus clusters differentiate mostly on the second factor, with lowest values for s <dig>  and highest values for s <dig> .

the spread of clusters correlates with geography, which translates into some isolation by distance. the relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic distance is strong and significant in both species when dropping the three populations  at the contact zone , but drastically reduced when including these three populations, due to strong differentiation over short geographic distances .

this enhanced differentiation between populations close to the contact zone correlates with increased genetic drift and loss of diversity. genetic diversity in b. balearicus populations decreases from hs =  <dig>  in mainland italy  to  <dig>  in calabria and northern sicily, down to  <dig>  at the contact zone . similarly , genetic diversity in b. siculus populations decreases from hs =  <dig>  south and west of the mount etna  to  <dig>  in populations closer to the contact zone .

crossing experiments
from an f1-cross b. balearicus x b. siculus obtained in spring  <dig>  about 80% offspring were viable and developed normally . the remaining 20% did not hatch or produced malformed, dwarfed and/or leucistic larvae . most of these died at early stages or during metamorphosis , and a few ones survived as never-metamorphosing "giant" tadpoles . the reciprocal cross  showed much lower survival after metamorphosis .

cross number, cross type, sexes, species, estimated hatching success, numbers of tadpoles at  <dig> day and two months after spawning, percentage of survival two months after spawning, remarks and survival at day  <dig> after metamorphosis for each cross. *note, in controls from two related green toad species, only  <dig> tadpoles were further raised.

we raised about  <dig> f1-metamorphs from the  <dig> cross to a snout-vent-length of ca.  <dig> cm, and kept  <dig> of them until secondary sexual characters became visible . though sex ratio was approximately even, we noticed about 30% of dwarfed f1-males that reached only about two-thirds the size of normal individuals. ten males and ten females were further raised until maturity . in spring  <dig>  we used one f <dig> of each sex to produce f2-hybrids  and reciprocal backcrosses with either b. siculus or b. balearicus . f2-hybrids turned out to be unviable, with all tadpoles dying a few days after hatching. while  <dig> out of  <dig> tadpoles from the backcrosses were still alive two months after spawning, they presented, a number of developmental abnormalities, including greenish individuals and a bimodal size distribution within the same cross , and suffered from dramatic mortality at later stages, with two individuals only surviving after metamorphosis.

discussion
our study shows that two distinct lineages of green toads  occur parapatrically in sicily. these lineages have diverged some  <dig>  my ago  <cit> , a time frame long enough to allow significant differentiation on both mitochondrial and nuclear dna sequences . as our study further shows, this divergence was also sufficient to bring the speciation process close to completion.

on the one hand, the endemic b. siculus, of north-african origin , occupies the western and southern parts of sicily, plus two small islands off the north-western coasts   <cit> . on the other hand, b. balearicus occupies the north-eastern part of sicily. based on their geographical localization and patterns of genetic similarity with mainland italy, we infer that these sicilian b. balearicus populations recently originated from close-by calabrian populations. faunal exchange across the strait of messina  are well documented for the upper pleistocene  <cit> . from our genetic analyses, these two species nowadays meet at the eastern coast of sicily, between the mount etna and the ionian sea. we cannot exclude that another contact exists along the north coast , but could not find any currently occupied site in this area despite thorough examination.

though very restricted, the documented contact zone shows signs of past hybridization, with differential introgression patterns depending on markers. mitochondrial alleles show a clear north-south cline, where the frequency of balearicus haplotypes progressively decreases from 94%  to 0%  over a distance of ca  <dig> km. cytonuclear disequilibrium occurred in individuals from both species, pointing to a two-way introgression. this presumably involved symmetric events of hybridization, followed by backcrossing of fertile f1-females with their paternal species. though no f1-hybrids were detected in the field, the occurrence of rare and symmetric events of hybridization was confirmed by a few backcrosses  identified via structure and newhybrids in both b. siculus and b. balearicus populations, as well as a two-way leak of diagnostic nuclear alleles.

however, nuclear introgression was surprisingly low overall. the transition between tropomyosine alleles from the two clades was abrupt, occurring at some point between populations  <dig>  and  <dig> , separated by just  <dig> km. the same holds for autosomal microsatellites in general, since structure assigned  all individuals from pop.  <dig> to balearicus, and all individuals from pop.  <dig> to siculus . the sharpness of this transition is underlined by the patterns of genetic differentiation: the two populations each side of the contact zone , though harboring a mix of mitochondrial haplotypes from both lineages, display the highest differentiation value observed in the study area . populations at the contact zone  are actually the ones most differentiated on the first pcagen factors .

genetic drift certainly plays a role in this strong local differentiation. the b. balearicus populations at the contact zone represent the front wave of a recent expansion, as evidenced by the drastic decrease in genetic diversity from mainland italy  to the southernmost populations . drift is certainly further amplified by the geographic localization of the contact zone: the geographical bottleneck between mount etna and the ionian sea creates a peninsular situation, largely isolating populations at the contact zone from conspecifics. this induces a strong differentiation over a small geographic scale, which somewhat blurs the overall clear pattern of isolation by distance observed in both species.

drift might also partly account for the marked contrast between mitochondrial and nuclear introgression. mitochondrial markers have low effective sizes , and are therefore more prone to introgression. in small hybridizing populations, mtdna might sometimes get fixed into foreign taxa via drift or founder effects, even with little or no gene flow at nuclear loci  <cit> . this contrast should be further amplified if females display lower effective size than males, which occurs when dispersal is male biased . effective population sizes at the front wave of expansions  largely depend on gene flow from incoming immigrants, and thus on the mode of inheritance of markers when dispersal is sex biased  <cit> .

in addition to drift and dispersal, selection often contributes crucially to the maintenance of narrow hybrid zones  <cit> . we think that the one under study is no exception, and that selection against nuclear introgression is very likely to also play a role. first, f1-hybrids from our experimental crosses showed reduced fitness . outcomes from reciprocal crosses were asymmetric, which often occurs in interspecific crosses , which should strongly reduce introgression. third, the currently known ranges of both taxa in sicily roughly coincide with the borders of semiarid  and arid  climates  <cit> . adaptation of these two genomes to different climates may select against hybrids, and potentially stabilize the contact zone.

the sex-specific phenotypic effects in the f <dig> as well as the dramatic hybrid breakdown observed both in backcrosses and in the f <dig> generation  were expected from the classical dobzhansky-muller model of speciation  <cit> , arising from the confrontation of incompatible genes and the disruption of co-adapted sets of genes. except for sex chromosomes in the heterogametic sex, f1-hybrids inherit complete sets of genes from both parental species and should thus suffer little from co-adaptation losses. we do not know, however, whether sex-specific differences in f <dig> phenotypes  conform to haldane's rule  <cit> , because sex-determination mechanisms are unknown for sicilian green toads . results from related species suggest a xx/xy-system for b. variabilis  from asia minor  <cit> , but a zz/zw-system for taxonomically undefined green toads from moldavia . contrasting with f <dig>  backcrosses and f <dig>  inherit imbalanced numbers of genes from both parental species due to recombination in f <dig>  and may thus lack crucial alleles at complementary loci. inbreeding presumably also played a role in our f <dig> crosses, which may partially explain the additional mortality relative to the breakdown observed in backcrosses . however, inbreeding is also expected to affect f <dig> × f <dig> crosses in the field, given the scarcity of hybridization events. it is also worth noting that a few backcrossed tadpoles survived metamorphosis. among such rare individuals, females are most likely responsible for the mitochondrial introgression and signs of nuclear allele leakage observed in the field.

important caveats obviously apply to our crossing experiments, mainly due to the practical difficulties in obtaining reproducing individuals from the field. absence of replicates limits the power of our inferences, and we lack the exact controls for intraspecific matings . results from these preliminary crosses must be clearly considered as provisional, but are worth reporting here as a support for our main conclusions gathered from field population-genetics data.

though many hybrid zones have been documented in amphibians , few provide the data required to calibrate the speciation process, in terms of reliable time of divergence and patterns of introgression in the field. a notable exception is provided by fire- and yellow-bellied toads, which constitute one of the best-studied anuran hybrid zones. bombina bombina and b. variegata, thought to have diverged during upper miocene or lower pliocene  hybridize in narrow, stable zones maintained by selection and dispersal  <cit> . strong selection against hybrids is generated both by hybrid breakdown  <cit> , and by environment-dependent selection against toads in mismatched habitats  <cit> .

however, mitochondrial introgression in bombina seems more limited than in sicilian green toads, with mtdna clines similar to or even steeper than those of nuclear loci . the divergence between b. siculus and b. balearicus is slightly more recent , but, despite higher mitochondrial dna introgression, we found almost no admixture at supposedly neutrally evolving nuclear microsatellite loci, suggesting stronger selection to keep gene pools apart.

CONCLUSIONS
while anuran species that diverged >  <dig> mya may exhibit partial or complete hybrid inviability in the laboratory, as recently shown for instance by a combination of experimental crosses and molecular divergence time estimates for the fejevarya limnocharis group  <cit> , there is accumulating evidence that anurans with plio-cene divergence tend to be reproductively isolated under natural conditions. secondary contacts between australian hylids of plio-pleistocene divergence have provided evidence for allopatric speciation driven by reinforcement mechanisms, characterized by highly asymmetric f1-viability in experimental crosses  <cit> . neither f <dig> and f2-hybrids nor backcrosses could be identified at a contact zone between two hyla species with an estimated pliocene divergence   <cit> , indicating a lack of current gene exchange. by contrast, phylogeographic studies  have shown that clades of more recent divergence  form "wide hybrid zone with a considerable genetic exchange between the two gene pools"  <cit> , suggesting that reproductive barriers are still low or inexistent.

the observed post-mating barriers  in sicilian green toads certainly induce selection to act against hybridization. therefore, we expect some pre-mating mechanisms to have evolved since the first contact of these allopatrically evolved lineages, which might also explain the absence of f1-hybrids. these two species have already been shown to differ in breeding phenology  <cit> . pre-mating isolation between closely related species  is widespread in anurans, sometimes even in absence of post-mating isolation  <cit> . the nature of barriers might also affect the structure of hybrid zones, since, due to female choice, mtdna is expected to introgress more readily than nuclear dna under pre-zygotic isolation mechanisms   <cit> . further insights on the evolutionary interactions between b. siculus and b. balearicus populations might be gained by collecting bio-acoustic and mate-choice data, together with additional crossing experiments.

whatever the exact causes, our data clearly show a virtual absence of gene flow at the present contact zone , meaning that the speciation process can be considered as close to have reached complete reproductive isolation after some  <dig>  my of divergence. these field data contrast sharply with the results from experimental hybridization in anurans, which show that some lineages may still produce viable f <dig> offspring after ca.  <dig> my of divergence . information on f1-hybridizability or viability gained under laboratory conditions may thus grossly overestimate the time required for genetic isolation and speciation to occur in anurans.
