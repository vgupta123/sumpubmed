BACKGROUND
transcription factor binding sites  play a very important role in the regulation of gene expressions. much research has been conducted on the discovery of tfbss using computational approaches. most of this research tries to discover all kinds of tfbss  <cit> . however, the specific category of tfbss, for example tata box, has not been analyzed in enough depth. the methods developed in the literature are targeted at discovering tfbss in the general sense; this however is not suitable for the discovery of the specific category of tfbss. in this research, we focus solely on the tata box, which is one of the most important tfbss. the tata box  is the first core promoter element identified in eukaryotic protein-coding genes  <cit> . in addition to the tata box elements, their extension sequences will also be analyzed to determine their frequency distribution across the entire range of human promoters.

a tata box extension sequence is a short dna sequence which consists of a tata box element and several bases flanking this element from either the left, or the right, or both sides. the analysis on tata box extension sequences will shed more insights on the mechanism of the binding between the tata binding protein and the tata box found in gene promoters.

the frequency distribution of tata elements and extension sequences are analyzed on six data sets of human promoters. two of the data sets were downloaded from the uscs genome database: one includes  <dig> human promoters  <dig> bp upstream from transcription start sites , and the other includes  <dig> human promoters  <dig> bp upstream from tsss. all of the promoter sequences in these two sets have previously been aligned to the tsss. it is also important to note that all of the repeated promoters in each of these two sets were deleted . therefore after the adjustment the final numbers of promoters in these two sets are  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. and s <dig> and s <dig> denote these two sets respectively. the other four data sets are derived from these two sets by further classifying genes into housekeeping genes and tissue-specific genes. lists of housekeeping genes and tissue-specific genes are collected from references  <cit> . shk <dig> and shk <dig> denote the sets of promoters of housekeeping genes with length  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and sts <dig> and sts <dig> denote the sets of promoters of tissue-specific genes with length  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. the numbers of promoters in these four sets are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
promoters which have been aligned to their tsss are divided into a number of bins, each of which contains  <dig> bp from each gene. we investigate the frequency distribution of the single nucleotides, tata elements and tata extension sequences on different sets of promoters. and we compare our findings from the human promoters with the findings from promoters of mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster.

frequency distribution of a, t, g and c in human promoters
first of all, we determine the distribution of each of the four single bases a, t, g and c in each of six data sets. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  bin  <dig> is the bin closest to tsss. a/t have lower abundance at the location close to tsss, while g/c have much higher abundance at that location. a, t, g and c show the same abundance at the location of around  <dig> bp upstream from tsss . from figure  <dig> and  <dig>  it is observed that the frequency distribution of a, t, g and c on the data set s <dig> is very similar with their frequency distribution on s <dig>  their frequency distribution on the promoters of housekeeping genes is almost the same as that on the promoters of tissue-specific genes as shown in figure  <dig> to  <dig>  except the slightly different locations where a, t, g and c has got the same abundance in these two data sets.

frequency distribution of tata elements
tata box contains sixteen elements. we investigate the frequency distribution of all these sixteen elements on the data set s <dig> and calculate their motif factors . two elements  show very high abundance at the location close to tsss, but do not show any abundance at other locations . figure  <dig> show the frequency distribution of these two tata elements. the maximal occurrence number of tataaaag is  <dig>  which appears at bin  <dig> . the maximal occurrence number of tatataag is  <dig>  which appears at bin  <dig> also. the mfs of tataaaag and tatataag are  <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

seven tata elements show decreasing abundance from 5' end of promoters to tsss . this is shown in figure  <dig>  the maximal occurrence numbers of these elements appear in the remote 5' end of the promoters, rather than at the location close to tsss. in these elements, tatatata has the biggest occurrence number  which appears at bin  <dig>  it is also observed that the occurrence number of tatatata is much larger than any other tata elements. tatatata's minimal occurrence number is  <dig>  which appears at bin  <dig> . tatatata's total number of occurrences is  <dig>  which is much larger than the total occurrence numbers of any other tata box element as well.

the frequency distribution of the remaining seven tata elements is shown in figure  <dig>  these elements show decreasing abundance from 5'end of promoters to near tsss, but there is strong abundance at the location close to tsss which is higher than the other locations . the maximal occurrence numbers of these elements appear at the location close to tsss. all these elements except tatataac get their maximal occurrence numbers in the second closest bin to tsss . the maximal occurrence number of tatataac appears at bin  <dig>  the general trend for the frequency distribution of these seven elements is: at first the occurrence numbers markedly drop at the approximate location of bin  <dig> from 5' end to tsss , then a sharp increase occurs at the location of bin  <dig>  and finally the occurrence numbers drop again in the last bin. bin  <dig> is the location where the tata box is supposed to reside.

in data set s <dig>  tataaaag and tatataag show similar frequency distribution pattern. they have got very high abundance at the location close to tsss . the maximal occurrence numbers of these two elements are  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, these figures are slightly smaller than their maximal occurrence numbers in s <dig>  the mfs of tataaaag and tatataag in s <dig> are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

the seven elements which show the bottom pattern of frequency distribution in s <dig> show the similar pattern in s <dig>  tatatata still has the largest total occurrence number in s <dig>  with an average number of occurrences of  <dig> , a maximal occurrence number of  <dig> which appears at bin  <dig>  and a minimal occurrence number of  <dig> which appears at bin  <dig> .

it is noted that seven elements which show the bottom-peak pattern of frequency distribution in s <dig> show a different pattern in s <dig>  they do not show any abundance at the location close to tsss at all in s <dig> . the maximal occurrence numbers of these seven elements appear at the location at least  <dig> bases upstream from tsss. this outcome implies that these seven elements might not be the real tata elements, or that perhaps different binding mechanisms are applied to these elements.

for data set shk <dig> and shk <dig>  all sixteen tata elements have very low occurrence numbers as shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the majority of the occurrence numbers are  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  it is also observed that the distribution of tatatata is again much higher than the other elements. the frequency distribution of sixteen tata elements in sts <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  which is similar with their frequency distribution in shk <dig> ). likewise, the frequency distribution of these elements in sts <dig> ) is similar with their frequency distribution in shk <dig> ).

frequency distribution of tata extension sequences
we investigate the frequency distribution of tata extension sequences which extend tata elements from either the left, or the right, or the both sides on data sets s <dig> and s <dig>  we do not however investigate their distribution on the remaining data sets, because these extension sequences have very small numbers of occurrences within them and therefore it would have been very difficult to mine meaningful information from such low frequency distributions.

the seven tata extension sequences which extend tata elements from the left have very high occurrence numbers at the location close to tsss in s <dig> as depicted in figure  <dig>  these sequences extend from tataaaag or tatataag. figure  <dig> shows the seven tata extension sequences which extend tata box elements from the right. these extension sequences have very high occurrence numbers at the location close to tsss in s <dig> as well. the majority of these sequences also extend from tataaaag and tatataag.

the tata extension sequences which extend the tata elements from both sides do not show high abundance at the location close to tsss.

the observed distribution patterns of the fourteen tata extension sequences shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> are very similar with their distribution patterns on s <dig> .

tataaaag and tatataag, from which the fourteen tata extension sequences mainly extend, show the strongest peaks at the location close to tsss. they also have the largest mfs amongst all tata box elements. the mfs of these two tata elements and the fourteen tata extension sequences are not less than  <dig> in both s <dig> and s <dig> as shown in table  <dig>  they have got very low p values which demonstrate their high mfs are not obtained by chance.

frequency distribution of tata elements and tata extension sequences on other organisms
it is assumed that biologically significant tata elements and tata extension sequences will be conserved during the course of evolution. therefore, we select several organisms which have different evolution distances from human including mice, zebrafish, and drosophila melanogaster, to verify the tata elements and tata extension sequences with high motif factors discovered in the above sections.

the mf of tatataag in human is the largest among the four organisms. however, the percentage of human promoters containing this element is the lowest . as with the tataaaag, the zebrafish receives the highest percentage of promoters containing tatataag. hence from the perspective of evolution, there is a decrease in the percentage of gene promoters containing tataaaag or tatataag. the investigation on the other tata elements leads to the same conclusion.

because of the extremely limited number of occurrences of tata extension sequences extending tata elements by more than one base in mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster, we only calculate the frequency distributions of tata sequences with one base extension on the promoters of the three organisms and compare them with their distribution in human promoters.

a tata extension sequence will be regarded as a conserved sequence if its motif factor in each organism is not less than  <dig>  seven conserved tata extension sequences are discovered from this research as shown in table  <dig>  it is also observed that all of the seven sequences show strong peaks at the location close to tsss in mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster besides human. these seven sequences extend from the same two tata elements as we mentioned before: tataaaag and tatataag. in these seven extension sequences all the extension bases are either g or c. this is a reasonable occurrence for human promoters because the g/c content is much higher than the a/t content at the location where tata box resides.

the tata extension sequence, tataaaagg, has the biggest motif factor amongst all tata elements and tata extension sequences in all four organisms . however, only  <dig>  percent of human promoters contain this sequence, this is the lowest in the percentages of promoters containing this element in any of the four organisms. tataaaagc has the largest motif factor in human . the percentage of human promoters containing this sequence is also the lowest in the percentages of promoters containing this element in all four organisms .

the average percentage of promoters containing tata extension sequences in human is lower than the average percentage in any of the other organisms, which can be observed from table  <dig>  and the drosophila has the highest average percentage of promoters containing tata extension sequences. this suggests that the percentage of gene promoters containing tata extension sequences is decreasing in the course of evolution. however, the seven tata extension sequences shown in table  <dig> are well conserved due to their high motif factors in each organism, which verifies the tata extension sequences extending from some tata elements by one base discovered by the statistical analysis on human promoters. the tata extension sequences of two bases extension from some tata elements are not examined here because of their very small number of occurrences in the bins of gene promoters of three other organisms.

discussion
the tata box is a t/a-rich sequence that is usually located 25– <dig> base pairs upstream of the tsss. recruitment of tbp and tbpassociated factors, all part of the tfiid complex, directs assembly of the pre-initiation complex , a highly regulated process that ensures precise initiation of transcription  <cit> . the consensus sequence of tata box is tatawawn  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that single nucleotides  show similar distribution pattern in the promoters of three types of genes . figure  <dig> shows that the a/t content decreases from the remote 5' end of the promoters to tsss. but there is a sudden increase of a/t content at the location close to the tsss. we can use this to help explain why at this location there is a tata box which mainly consists of a and t. the g/c content increases from 5' end of the promoters to tsss. at the location close to tsss, the g/c content was much higher than the a/t content. therefore tata box should be easily identified at this location because of the very low a/t content in this area.

according to the early studies, tata box is strictly conserved and essential for transcription initiation from all protein-coding genes from yeast to man. however, the recent research suggests that the prevalence of the tata box diminished  <cit> . suzuki et al indicates that tata boxes are present in 32% of  <dig> potential core promoters  <cit> . a genome wide analysis points out that the percentage of tata-containing promoters is much lower than commonly recognized  <cit> . our study shows that only 24% of  <dig> human promoters of length  <dig> contain tata boxes. we also find that 27% of mice promoters,  <dig> % of zebrafish promoters and  <dig> % of drosophila promoters contain tata box.

it is observed that two tata elements tataaaag and tatataag have extraordinarily higher abundance at the location close to tsss than any other tata elements. mfs of these two elements were  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, but mfs of other tata elements range from only  <dig>  to  <dig> . tatataag is identified as the optimal tbp recognition sequence  <cit> . tataaaag, as asymmetrical tata sequence, is bound by tbp in a polar manner in the tbp-dna cocrystals  <cit> . the orientation of an asymmetrical tata box will influence the transcription direction  <cit> .

we find that those tata extension sequences which have high mfs are mostly flanked by g and c. bucher demonstrated that tata box is often flanked by g/c-rich sequences  <cit> . of the fourteen tata extension sequences identified from human promoters in this study, gtataaaag is observed upstream the 5s rrna genes of both 5s rdna classes detected in o. niloticus  <cit> . also the ctataaaag is a conserved tata motif  <cit> .

in addition to these two tata extension sequences, the other five tata extension sequences which extend tata elements by one base are verified by the comparative analysis on the promoters of human, mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster . we do not however investigate the frequency distribution of other tata extension sequences which extend tata elements by more than one base due to their very low occurrence numbers in mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper uses a statistical approach to analyze the frequency distribution of tata elements and tata extension sequences on the promoters of human and three other organisms. the contributions of this work are three-fold:  detailed analysis on the frequency distribution of tata elements and tata extension sequences on human promoters;  comparison between the frequency distribution of tata elements on the promoters of human housekeeping genes with their frequency distribution on the promoters of human tissue specific genes;  comparison between the frequency distribution of tata elements and tata extension sequences on human promoters with their frequency distribution on the promoters of mice, zebrafish and drosophila melanogaster.

we suggest that the tata extension sequences discovered as a result of this research are the potential candidates of new transcription factor binding sites due to their extraordinarily high statistical significance. elucidation of the frequency distribution of tata elements and tata extension sequences on the promoters of human and other organisms will contribute to the better understanding of tata box and the determination of exact tata binding sites.
