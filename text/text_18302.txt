BACKGROUND
it is recommended that the highest quality rna be used for genomic analyses. however, in some cases, such as human autopsy samples or paraffin embedded tissues, high quality rna samples may not be available. it is therefore important to understand how rna quality affects the interpretation of the results and also how reliable current quality measures are at indicating rna quality issues. it has been reported that gene expression profiling on affymetrix genechip arrays is relatively tolerant to moderate rna degradation and to the 5'-truncation that occurs during the two successive rounds of in vitro transcription needed to detect small sample quantities  <cit> . some samples fall within a "grey zone" of sample quality, where there is some loss of rna integrity but the samples still pass rna quality thresholds. it is unknown how differences in rna integrity within the "grey zone" affect the data interpretation. more information is needed to help guide the generation of best practice recommendations for sample handling and the evaluation of the quality of genomic studies submitted to public databases to fulfill journal requirements and to regulatory agencies.

the recommended method for preparing target from rna for hybridization to affymetrix microarrays is based on the eberwine procedure  <cit> . the sample labeling and amplification method starts with cdna synthesis from the polyadenylation  site followed by the generation of crna from the sense strand of the cdna via an incorporated t <dig> primer sequence. because this process generates labeled target with a 3' bias, affymetrix genechip rat expression set  <dig>  arrays are designed to contain probes that reside within the  <dig> nucleotides  most proximal to the 3' end of each transcript  <cit> . where alternative polya sites are identified within  <dig> nt of each other, the probe selection region is based on the most upstream site. the housekeeping genes beta-actin  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  serve as internal controls of rna quality and the target preparation process. probe sets have been designed to hybridize to the 5', middle , or 3'-regions of these control transcripts. high signal ratios of the 3' probe set to the 5' probe set are indicative of either rna degradation or target synthesis problems. it has been recommended that samples should have a 3'/5' signal ratio for gapdh of no more than  <dig>  <cit> .

various methods for measuring sample quality pre- and post-hybridization have been proposed  <cit> . in this study the degree of rna degradation was standardized by use of an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer to assign an rna integrity number  to each sample. the rin software algorithm classifies the integrity of eukaryotic total rna on a scale of  <dig> to  <dig>  based on the most informative features of an electropherogram of the 18s and 28s rrna peaks  <cit> .

in this study a set of rat liver samples with a progressive loss in rna quality was generated. this dataset was used to characterize individual probe set sensitivity to rna degradation and to evaluate the effect of rna integrity on the sensitivity and specificity of microarray data generated on affymetrix genechip arrays.

RESULTS
effect of sample handling on rna integrity
the methods used to harvest and preserve source tissue for gene expression analyses can impact the quality of isolated mrna and the reliability of microarray data generated from this source. we investigated the relative impact of several different tissue handling conditions on rna integrity. these conditions were designed to model the effect of time between necropsy or sacrifice and sample processing  or between removal from storage and sample processing . fresh liver tissue was incubated up to  <dig> hr at room temperature without a measurable effect on rna integrity, as measured by rin . rna in fresh liver tissue proved to be remarkably stable. rna degradation was only observed after fresh liver tissue was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min or more and poor quality rna  appeared after  <dig>  hours of incubation at 37°c. rna degradation was much more rapid in frozen tissue. poor quality rna  was isolated from frozen tissue thawed for 15– <dig> min at room temperature.

sample characterization by rna quality metrics
for each of the sample handling conditions that induced rna degradation ), sets of progressively degraded rna were generated in independent experiments, with each experiment using a single liver lobe from a different individual animal as source tissue. each of these sets contains a minimum of  <dig> rna samples across three or more replicate experiments with rin values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  electrophoretic tracings of rna with rin measurements of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> are shown in figure  <dig> for three independent samples in each sample handling set. the tracings are highly similar between samples with the same rin, but show subtle differences between the two handling methods for a given rin value. within each handling condition,  <dig> samples with similar rin values were grouped as replicate samples in all additional analyses on the effects of rna degradation.

next, the relationship was examined between rin and  <dig> other rna quality metrics  that are generated before or during microarray sample preparation . of these  <dig> metrics, rin value was most highly correlated with average crna length across a set of  <dig> samples generated from both handling methods . rin values also correlated fairly well with crna yield and with 28s/18s ribosomal rna ratios . some differences in the correspondence between rin value and the other  <dig> rna metrics were observed between the two different handling methods. in general, there was a stronger decreasing trend in metric value as a function of rin for rna degraded by f/t than for rna degraded by 37°c incubation.

microarray quality metrics and signal changes induced by rna degradation
to systematically assess the effect of degree of rna integrity on microarray data, rna samples in each rin group were analyzed on affymetrix genechip rat expression 230a arrays for both handling conditions. most of the global microarray quality metrics that are summarized in affymetrix report files were within normal ranges for the  <dig> samples with rin ≥  <dig>  all samples had percent present calls within 10% of the mean value . the scale factors  for all but one hybridization were within  <dig> sd of the mean  and all were within  <dig> sd of the mean. all samples except one rin  <dig> sample and  <dig> rin  <dig> samples in the f/t set had 3'/5' gapdh ratios below the recommended threshold of  <dig>  the effect on 3'/5' gapdh and 3'/5' actb ratios corresponded well with average crna transcript length . the 3' boundaries of the target sequences  for the 5' gapdh and actb probe sets are located about  <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively, upstream of the 3' end of their corresponding refseqs and span about  <dig> nt in length . targets that are less than  <dig> nt in length on average  would be expected to exhibit significantly reduced hybridization to these probe sets.

the quality metrics discussed so far are summary metrics that provide an assessment or surrogate measure of the overall integrity of the sample. individual probe set signals may vary in their sensitivity to rna degradation. to visualize the effect of handling condition and degree of rna degradation on individual gene expression profiles, we limited the comparison set to the genes that were most affected by sample incubation . the relationship between the log <dig> ratio data for the filtered sets of noncontrol samples from the f/t and 37°c incubations was displayed by plotting the heatmap and dendrograms resulting from average linkage hierarchical clustering . the samples clustered primarily by handling condition and then by degree of degradation. in general, four different patterns of probe set responses are visualized in the heat map. the majority of probe sets showed a decrease in signal induced by degradation that was independent of handling condition and observable in even moderately degraded  samples. a second, smaller cluster exhibited an increase in signal induced by degradation by either method. the expression levels of a third subset of genes were selectively altered by ex vivo incubation at 37°c . the  <dig> genes in this cluster are primarily involved in cellular defense responses like the mitogen activated protein kinase  pathway , immune response , response to hypoxia   <cit> , cell growth regulation  or other stress responses . over expression of zfp <dig>  btg <dig>  c-jun, and egr- <dig> has also been reported to occur in surgically extirpated prostate tissue after  <dig> hr of warm ischemia  <cit> . dusp <dig> and egr- <dig> are also  <dig> of  <dig> gene transcripts that increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells prepared by ficoll-hypaque density centrifugation at 21°c compared to 8°c  <cit> . independent confirmation of an increase in egr <dig> mrna levels  was conducted using qrt-pcr . a fourth cluster of  <dig> probe sets were selectively decreased in signal after  <dig> hr ex vivo incubation at 37°c. more than 75% of these probe sets hybridize to transcripts that are either highly expressed in immune cells or involved in immune function . ex vivo incubation may have caused a selective loss in the presence, function or integrity of immune cells in the liver samples.

characterization of probe set sensitivity to rna degradation
the correlation between rna degradation by f/t and average crna length observed in table  <dig> suggests that relative probe set position on a target reference sequence may be a determinant of sensitivity to degradation. to examine this further, probe sets were first identified that showed a statistically significant difference in signal level between rin groups and a progressively increasing or decreasing trend in average signal between rin  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sets generated by f/t . only probe sets that mapped to a single reference sequence  transcript containing a terminal polya sequence ≥  <dig> nt were selected in order to accurately measure probe set location relative to the reverse transcription initiation site. using these criteria,  <dig> dec and  <dig> inc probe sets were identified.  <dig> probe sets were also identified that were relatively invariant in signal as a function of rin .

for probe sets classified as inv or dec, seven measurements were made to characterize the location and length of each probe set target sequence on its corresponding reference transcript sequence . the inc set was not further characterized because of the small sample size. the metrics were refseq length, targetseq length, targetseq length/refseq length, 5'-3' distance , 3'-3' distance , 5'-5' distance , and average rin  <dig>  signal. a mean and standard deviation for each distance metric was calculated within dec or inv groups . individual measurements for each probe set in the dec and inv groups are tabulated in additional file  <dig>

the correlation between each distance metric and probe set sensitivity to rna integrity was examined in an unpaired t-test comparison of dec and inv probe set metrics. probe sets that decreased in signal as a function of decreasing rna integrity tended to be located significantly farther from the 3' end of their target transcript sequences than inv probe sets  . while average targetseq length did not significantly differ between dec and inv groups, dec probes tended to map to longer refseq transcripts and therefore had lower targetseq length/refseq length ratios. dec probe sets also tended to be lower in signal in undegraded  samples than inv probe sets.

unlike inv probe sets, the 5'-3' distances of dec probe sets were bimodally distributed with maxima near  <dig> and  <dig> nt . the dec probe sets were divided into two groups with 5'-3' distances either less than or greater than  <dig> nt and analyzed further. the majority  of dec probe sets including affx_rat_gapdh_5_at and affx_rat_beta-actin_5_at had 5'-3' distances >  <dig> nt. all metrics that were significantly different for the dec group as a whole were also significantly changed for this subset. the  <dig> dec probe sets with 5'-3' distances <  <dig> nt  were significantly different from inv probe sets in targetseq length, targetseq length/refseq length, and average rin  <dig>  signal .

effect of level of rna integrity on microarray performance
sensitivity  and specificity  are important performance objectives for microarray experiments. in toxicogenomic experiments that are designed to measure the effect of time and dose level of treatment on gene expression, misleading results can be generated by confounding variables such as rna degradation, tissue sectioning, diurnal effects, etc. the effect of rna degradation on assay specificity was measured by comparing control liver samples in which rin level was the independent variable. statistical analysis of microarrays  was applied at a median false discovery rate  of  <dig>  in two-sample comparisons of undegraded control liver rna  with liver samples of decreasing rin value generated by f/t. comparisons of rin  <dig>  samples with rin  <dig> or  <dig> samples yielded  <dig> or  <dig> false positives, respectively, using signals derived with either mas <dig> or plier. a high number of statistically significant changes in signal level were observed for rin  <dig>  and rin  <dig> sample comparisons .

the effect of rin level on sensitivity was assessed using receiver operating characteristic  plots that measure diagnostic accuracy. roc plots are generated by plotting sensitivity  versus 1-specificity  along a continuum of decision thresholds . known gene expression changes were modeled in silico using a mixed tissue paradigm designed to measure microarray performance  <cit> . two mixtures composed of different proportions of rat testis, brain, liver, and kidney rna are the components of a reference material that has signal ratios of 1: <dig>  2: <dig>  3: <dig>  and 1: <dig> in tissue-selective probe sets. this mixed tissue rna design can be effectively modeled in silico from array data for each tissue rna component in the mixture. microarray signal data from rat liver rna with different levels of rna integrity  generated by f/t, was combined in silico with signal data from rat brain, testis, and kidney rna. assay sensitivity for detecting a true positive fold change of  <dig> -, 2-, or 4-fold at a fixed false positive rate of 10% was calculated for each rna quality level from data modeled with proportional differences in liver-selective  signal and a 1: <dig> ratio of kidney-selective  signal. these calculations were made using the entire set of  <dig> ls probe sets unselected for sensitivity to rna degradation  or subsets of probe sets that either significantly decrease  or are invariant in signal  as a function of rna quality as true positives and  <dig> ks probe sets as true negatives .

assay sensitivity was markedly decreased by the use of ls_dec or ls_all probe sets as analytes for detecting modeled changes of  <dig> -, 2-, and 4-fold as a function of rin level. the effect was most pronounced for ls_dec probes, for  <dig> -fold change detection, and for rna quality of rin ≤  <dig>  roc plots that used ls_inv probe sets as analytes showed no change in sensitivity as a function of either rin level or fold change detection.

discussion
in this study, it was observed that time after thawing had a greater effect on rna integrity than time of incubation of liver tissue after surgical removal at either room temperature or 37°c . freezing disrupts tissue structure, rendering the tissue highly sensitive to rna degradation. in contrast, autolysis of fresh liver tissue appeared to be a much slower process. to minimize the potential impact of rna degradation on microarray data, resected tissue should be sectioned and either flash frozen or immersed in a tissue stabilization solution such as rnalater. archived frozen tissue should be quickly disrupted and homogenized in denaturing solutions after removal from storage. homogenization can be performed more rapidly if tissue is cut into smaller sections prior to freezing.

although ex vivo incubation of tissue for several hours had little effect on rna integrity, it did induce changes in the expression of ischemia-induced and early immediate genes, as has been reported by others  <cit> . many inflammatory response gene transcripts are inherently unstable as a mechanism to control cellular response to certain stimuli  <cit> . the increases in signal observed with 37°c incubation could result from de novo transcription or stabilization of labile mrnas through, for example, the activation of mapk or other signaling pathways  <cit> . incubation of liver sections at 37°c also induced a selective decrease in a set of genes associated with immune function. delay in sample processing has been observed to cause a decrease in the levels of selective transcripts in blood cells  <cit> . alternatively, this result could have arisen from selective loss of an immune cell population in liver through diffusion or autolysis.

a majority  of the probe set signals identified as most sensitive to sample incubation at 37°c or after thawing  are expressed in whole tissue rna preparations from brain, kidney, and heart in addition to liver . although differences in the kinetics of postmortem rna degradation have been observed between tissue types  <cit> , it is anticipated that signals for most of these  <dig> probe sets would also be sensitive to sample integrity in these other tissues. similarly designed studies using other tissues may identify additional probe sets that are sensitive to sample integrity but not expressed in rat liver.

a subtle but reproducible difference in the relationship between rin value and qualitative  or other quantitative rna metrics  was observed between samples generated by different tissue handling methods . the method of degrading rna may release or activate ribonucleases with different specificities or differentially affect ribonuclease access to substrate. for example, ribonucleases  <dig> and  <dig> have different ph optima and substrate preferences for poly and poly  <cit> . freeze/thaw may be the more relevant method of inadvertent sample degradation associated with toxicogenomic studies. the correlations observed here between rin levels generated by f/t of liver tissue and other sample quality metrics may not necessarily be applicable for other mechanisms of rna degradation  or for other tissues. for example, a threshold rin value of  <dig>  has been recently proposed for optimal rna reliability for analysis of human tumor samples on affymetrix genechip arrays, where reliability was defined as a 3'/5' gapdh ratio threshold ≤  <dig>   <cit> . in our study, only samples with rin ≥  <dig> had 3'/5' gapdh ratios ≤  <dig> .

more interlaboratory studies are needed to evaluate the reproducibility of rin and its correlation to performance on multiple array formats before a rin threshold can be recommended as a component of best practices for microarray data generation. the advantage to rin as a metric is that it is an automated measurement made prior to performing expensive in vitro transcription  assays and array hybridizations. although average crna length correlated well with microarray sample quality in this study, this value is currently not an automated measurement that is calculated by agilent bioanalyzer software and needs to be estimated from electropherograms by the end user.

the primary effect of rna degradation on samples analyzed on microarrays was a decrease in the average length of products that are reverse transcribed and amplified using t <dig> polymerase. the multiple rounds of in vitro transcription that are used to generate samples from small amounts of rna from biopsies or laser-captured microdissections also induce a decrease in transcript crna yield and length  <cit> . amplifying target from small samples was associated with a loss of signal for gene transcripts with high gc content and with a greater number and length of predicted hairpin formations  <cit> . we did not observed any difference in gc content between probe sets that were most and least sensitive to rna degradation generated by f/t in rat liver .

a relatively small percentage  of probe sets that are on rae230a arrays and expressed in liver were found to be similar in sensitivity to crna target length as the 5'-probe sets for gapdh or actb. of the probe sets with this sensitivity that also had verifiable transcription termini, most  were located more than  <dig> nt upstream of the 3'-end of their target sequences. for the remaining dec probe sets that were located within the designed probe selection region, no other measure of probe set length or location was identified that was significantly different from inv probe sets and could explain the enhanced sensitivity to rna degradation.

in comparisons of probe set level signal data from undegraded  rna with rna of progressively decreasing rna integrity , a substantial increase in the rate of detection of false positives was observed when rin values are ≤  <dig>  comparisons of samples with different rin levels could occur in toxicogenomic studies where treatment conditions have induced a degree of damage and vehicle-treated control tissue is unaffected. similar effects are possible in comparisons of results between single and multiple rounds of amplification. in one study, protocol method  was shown to have a bigger effect on signal variance than tissue type   <cit> 

in our analysis of the effect of rna integrity on assay sensitivity, probe set level signals from both "control" and "treated" samples were modeled from rna with the same rin. this design interrogates a decrease in sensitivity in studies where rna integrity is similar for all samples but at lower than optimal levels because of tissue handling or rna isolation method. the accuracy of true positive detection of in silico modeled changes of  <dig> -, 2-, and 4-fold was reduced for rna samples with rin values ≤  <dig>  the effect was greatest for probe sets most sensitive to sample integrity and was less pronounced for probe sets unselected for an effect of rna degradation on signal level.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we examined the effect of sample integrity on microarray performance through the use of samples with a progressive decrease in rna quality that was indexed using a sensitive automated metric of rna degradation . we identified a rin threshold beyond which we observed a decrease in assay specificity and sensitivity. the effect on assay performance could be linked to a decrease in hybridization of target to probe sets that map more than  <dig> nt upstream of the transcription termini on their corresponding reference sequences.
