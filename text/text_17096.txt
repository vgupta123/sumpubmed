BACKGROUND
human papillomaviruses  are small, double-stranded dna viruses that infect the mucosal epithelial tissues of anogenital tract, oral cavity and upper alimentary tract, as well as cutaneous epithelial tissues of hands, feet and trunks. hpvs have been grouped into cutaneous type that causes cutaneous warts and epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and mucosal type that predominantly induces benign and malignant lesions of the genital tract, in which hpv- <dig> has been frequently associated with verrucae vulgaris  <cit> . hpv- <dig> genome is composed of eight open reading frames  encoding the regulatory proteins essential for completion of the viral life cycle and the structural components of the virion, respectively  <cit> .

hpvs' e <dig> proteins are believed to control the transcriptions of viral genes through binding to the specific sites in viral dna, multiple copies of which are found in the viral upstream regulatory regions   <cit> . the hpv e <dig> protein can function as either a repressor or an activator of the early gene transcription, depending on the location of e <dig> binding sites in the viral regulatory region as previously demonstrated for genital hpvs  <cit> . the structure of the e <dig> protein resembles a typical transcription factor, with an amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain  and a carboxyl-terminal dna-binding/dimerization domain , separated by a variable hinge region  <cit> . the e <dig> protein exists in solution and binds to the target dna as a dimmer. the hpv- <dig> e2-dbd forms a dimeric β-barrel, with each subunit contributing an anti-parallel 4-stranded β-sheet "half-barrel"  <cit> . several studies showed that e <dig> acts as a transactivator at low concentrations, while as a repressor at high concentration. recently, it has been reported that the locations of e <dig> binding sites are important for transcriptional repression, independent of binding affinities  <cit> .

besides being a transcriptional regulator in the life-cycle of virus, e <dig> protein is believed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis of hpv-associated cancers. the hpv genome can exist in the malignant cells in two forms, integrated into the host chromosome or episomal dna. the majority of hpv-associated cancers, especially cervical carcinoma, contain integrate hpv dna  <cit> . usually, integration of viral genome into host chromosome results in disruptions of e <dig> and e <dig> orfs, leading to an increased transcription from the viral early promoter and elevated expression of viral oncogenes e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . about 15-20% hpv-positive cervical cancers contain intact hpv genomes in extrachromosomal state. various point mutations or deletions in the hpv genome were reported to be related to the viral oncogenesis potential, e.g. in the long control region   <cit> , e <dig> and e <dig> orfs  <cit> . previously we reported a verrucae vulgaris patient with huge extensive clustered cutaneous who was confirmed to be infected by a hpv- <dig> variant  <cit> . several point mutations were detected in the lcr of this hpv- <dig> variant that lead to an increased promoter activity. in addition, five point mutations were found within the e <dig> orf. expression of the e <dig> mutant exhibited increased activities on the viral early promoter as compared with the prototype e <dig>  <cit> .

in order to gain insight into the potential influences of these mutations within e <dig>  we constructed a series of mammalian and prokaryotic expressing plasmids encoding e <dig> proteins with one to five amino acid  substitutions. upon co-transfection with a cat reporter under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr, the e <dig> construct containing the a338v mutation within the dna-binding domain functioned as a transactional activator instead of repressor. electrophoretic mobility shift assays  demonstrated that the ability of e <dig> protein with a338v mutation bind a double-stranded dna sequence containing two e <dig> binding sites is markedly stronger than hpv- <dig> prototype e <dig>  the binding affinity of the e <dig> a338v mutant for the promoter-proximal lcr sequences of hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> were also significantly increased. structural analyses indicated that the mutation a338v located in the region of beta barrel. these results imply that the mutation a338v is critical for the e <dig> dna-binding and promoter regulation.

RESULTS
the a338v mutation within the hpv- <dig> e <dig> dna-binding domain is critical for e <dig> transcriptional regulation activity on the hpv- <dig> early promoter
to assess the effect of the point mutations within e <dig> on its transcriptional activity, a series of hpv- <dig> e <dig> mammalian expressing plasmids were constructed. these include the point mutations within the e <dig> transactivation, hinge and dna-binding regions. in addition, two plasmids expressing truncated e <dig> proteins were also generated . to detect expression of hpv- <dig> e <dig> from the transiently transfected plasmids in the cultured cells, hela and c33a cells transfected with pcdna-e2-proto and pcdna-e2-a338v were harvested  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post-transfection, respectively. the presences of hpv e <dig> proteins in cell lysates were confirmed by western blot with a hpv- <dig> e <dig> specific monoclonal antibody  prepared with a full-length recombinant hpv- <dig> e <dig> protein as immunogen, which recognized the segments of n-terminus and hinge region of e <dig> protein  . in addition, e <dig> expressing in hela cells were also evaluated by western blots after co-transfection of the hpv- <dig> e <dig> plasmids with the pcat-lcr  reporter plasmid. as shown in figure 1c, the full-length e <dig>  and n-terminal e <dig>  were detected, whereas no signal was observed for the c-terminal e <dig> 

under our experimental condition, transfection of the blank cat reporter vector  did not induce detectable cat expression . consistent with previous observations in hela cells containing hpv- <dig> genome  <cit> , co-transfection of pcdna-e2-proto significantly reduced the hpv- <dig> lcr driven cat expression , whereas co-transfection of pcdna-e2-mut significantly increased the cat expression . co-transfected with the plasmids encoding n-  and c-terminal  e <dig> resulted in significantly higher cat expressions than that with the plasmid encoding full-length prototype e <dig>  transfection of the plasmids expressing single point mutation within the transactivation domain  and the hinge region  resulted in comparable cat expressions as that of prototype e <dig>  while pcdna-e2-l118s/s235p induced a relatively higher cat expression. interestingly, transient transfection of pcdna-e2-a338v containing a single point mutation in the e <dig> dna-binding domain led to a significantly increased cat expression that was even slightly higher than that of pcdna-e2-mut. in contrast, transfection of pcdna-e2-mut  containing all four point mutations but a338v caused a significant repression of cat expression that was comparable with pcdna-e2-proto. these results demonstrate that the a338v mutation within the dna-binding domain is essential for the e <dig> repression activity.

next, we examined the transcriptional activity of e <dig> with a338v mutation the hpv-negative cervical cancer cell lines c33a and the hpv- <dig> genome-containing siha cells. consistent with the results in hela cells, under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr, co-expression of pcdna-e2-proto and pcdna-e2-mut  led to obviously low cat expressions compared with mock, whereas co-expressions of pcdna-e2-mut and pcdna-e2-a338v caused high cat expressions . notably, in pcdna-e2-a338v-transfected cells, the relative cat expression was higher than that of mock. these results imply that the transcriptional repression activity of e <dig> mutant a338v is independent of the endogenous hpv genome.

the a338v e <dig> mutant increased the binding capacity to the dna sequences containing conservative e <dig> binding sites in vitro
to explore the mechanism for derepression on the hpv- <dig> promoter activity caused by the mutation a338v, a serial of recombinant e <dig> proteins were expressed and purified in e. coli. figure 3a summarizes the e <dig> proteins in different contexts, including one construct of e <dig> transactivation domain, two constructs of e <dig> dna-binding region, four constructs of e <dig> hinge region and dna-binding domain and four constructs of full-length e <dig>  all proteins were expressed in soluble form as gst-fusions .

using the biotin-labeled double-stranded oligo hpv-e2bs containing two e <dig> protein binding sites , the dna-binding activities of different expressed e <dig> proteins were evaluated by emsa. the specificity of oligo hpv-e2bs for hpv e <dig> protein was first evaluated by competition experiments with homologous or heterologous unlabeled oligos. compared with the clear dna-protein complex formation in the mixture of hpv- <dig> e <dig> and oligo hpv-e2bs, addition of the excessive cold homologous oligo instead of the heterologous oligo t <dig> . to get more evidences on the specificity of the binding of oligo hpv-e2bs with e <dig> protein, the recombinant hpv- <dig> e <dig> was incubated with a mab against hpv- <dig> e <dig> prior to emsa. along with the reductions of the signals of the dna-e <dig> complexes in the presence of mab anti-e <dig>  obvious supershifts were detected . these results indicate the interaction between oligo hpv-e2bs and e <dig> protein is specific.

in the context of e <dig> binding domain, both prototype e <dig> and the a338v mutant e <dig> formed protein-dna complexes with the probes in a dose-dependent manner. interestingly, the binding activity of e <dig> mutant was significant stronger than that of prototype e <dig> . to confirm this phenomenon, four e <dig> proteins covering e <dig> hinge region and dna-binding region were employed into emsa. figure 4c showed that the dna-binding activity of e2-hc-a338v was stronger than that of prototype e2-hc. additionally, e2-hc-mut with a338v and other three point mutations in hinge region showed similar dna-binding activity as e2-hc- <dig> v, while e2-hc-mut  with only three mutations in hinge region caused similar dna-binding activity as prototype e2-hc. as expected, neither gst nor e <dig> transactivation domain , formed a complex in emsa. similar manner were observed in the emsa in the context of full-length e <dig> protein, in which two constructs containing the a338v mutation  formed more obvious protein-dna complexes than the other two constructs without the a338v mutation ), regardless of having the point mutations in the transactivation domain and hinge area . these results highly suggest that the substitution of ala to val at residual  <dig> in hpv- <dig> e <dig> protein influences critically its dna-binding affinity.

e <dig> dna-binding affinities were influenced by the length of the e <dig> peptides
from the emsa results shown in figure  <dig>  it seemed that the dna-binding activities of e <dig> were also affected by the length of the peptides. to address this possibility, the same molar number of e <dig> proteins in three different lengths was mixed with biotin-labeled oligos. with  <dig>  fm of oligos, only the e2-c construct formed detectable protein-dna complexes . the protein-dna complexes of e2-hc constructs were clearly observed when the amount of oligo was increased to  <dig> fm, while that of e2-c became much stronger . when the amounts of oligo increased to  <dig> fm, the protein-dna complexes formed by the constructs of e2-fl became visible . in addition, the a338v e <dig> formed abundant protein-dna complex in all three lengths of e <dig> peptides tested and in all three concentrations of oligo. these results suggest that the transactivation domain and the hinge region of e <dig> play a negative role in its dna binding affinity.

the a338v e <dig> mutants increased the binding affinity to the promoter-proximal lcr sequences of hpv- <dig> and hpv-16
to evaluate the dna-binding activities of e <dig> with a338v to the wild-type hpv sequences, the biotin-labeled double-stranded oligos derived from the sequences of prototype hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> lcrs, which contained two e <dig> protein binding sites, were mixed with equal amount of the different recombinant prototype and mutated e <dig> proteins and assessed in emsa. consistent with results shown in figure  <dig>  the a338v e <dig> mutants showed clearly stronger binding affinities to both hpv- <dig>  and hpv- <dig>  oligos than the hpv- <dig> prototype e <dig>  in the context of either full-length or truncated forms. no difference was observed in the binding affinity of hpv- <dig> e <dig> to the lcr sequences of homologous or heterologous hpv genotypes. these results show that a338v e <dig> mutant has stronger binding affinity to the promoter-proximal lcr sequences of wild-type hpvs. e <dig> c-terminus  possessed much stronger binding activities to hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> lcr than e2-hc and e2-fl, which were coincident well with the binding tendency of different e <dig> in length shown in figure 4b, c and 4d. the multiple bands at higher molecular weight position in the gels  may represent the dimmers of the e <dig> proteins.

co-expressions of hpv- <dig> e <dig> mutants with a338v induced more active activity on heterologous hpv- <dig> early promoter p <dig> than the hpv- <dig> prototype e <dig> 

in order to figure out whether the e <dig> mutation a338v induced similar effectiveness on viral early promoter of heterologous genotype hpv, a cat-reporter plasmid under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr was co-transfected with same amount of various hpv- <dig> e <dig> expressing plasmids, including pcdna-e2-proto, pcdna-e2-mut, pcdna-e2-mut and pcdna-e2-a338v, respectively. remarkably decreased cat expression was observed when pcdna-e2-proto was co-transfected , indicating that hpv- <dig> e <dig> was able to inhibit the activity of hpv- <dig> promoter p <dig>  similar to the observations under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr, expressions of either e <dig> with single a338v mutation  or a338v plus other four point mutations  resulted in significantly more cat expressions under the control of hpv- <dig> lcr. as expected, transfection of pcdna-e2-mut   with other four point mutations except a338v still maintained the same repression on p <dig> activity as that of pcdna-e2-proto. these data suggest that the a338v e <dig> mutant may reverse its regulation activity on viral early promoters of hpvs with similar upstream constructs.

discussion
in this study we have provided evidence data that a naturally occurred mutation of a338v in hpv- <dig> e <dig> increases e <dig> dna-binding capacity and reverses its transcriptional regulation activity on the viral early promoter. the effect of this mutation on the biological functions of e <dig> seems to be very critical, since the other four amino acid exchanges locate at the transactivation domain and the hinge regions of e <dig> have little impact. the e <dig> protein has the typical structure of transcriptional regulator, which consists of a multiple-protein-binding transactivation domain, a dna-binding/dimerization domain, and a flexible linker  <cit> . consistent with other previous studies, our data confirm that although the c-terminal segment of e <dig> alone has dna-binding capacity, lacking its n-terminal portion makes the truncated e <dig> almost loss it's of promoter repressor activity. our data indicate that the e <dig> n-terminal alone works as a transcriptional activator, inducing about  <dig> -fold increased promoter activity. however, this positive effect on the promoter is totally abolished in the context of whole e <dig> protein. the substitution of l118s in the e <dig> transactivation domain shows no influence on either dna-binding or promoter activity. the contribution of e <dig> hinge region to its transcriptional regulator is believed to be not essential  <cit> , as three naturally occurred mutations in this area together do not influence either the e <dig> dna-binding or transcriptional activation.

the structural analysis of the c-terminal dbd from several pv e <dig> proteins, e.g. hpv- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and bovine papillomavirus , either alone or together with tad, suggest it to be a tight dimer upon dna binding  <cit> . the structure of e <dig> dna-binding domain is conserved among hpv families  <cit> . e <dig> dna-binding domains of hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> have 52% identity and there is only one gap between the alignments . with software modeller <dig>  and namd <dig> , we have constructed 3d structures of dna-binding domains of wild-type  and mutant  e <dig> proteins using the published crystal structure of hpv- <dig> e <dig> dna-binding domain as the template. the amino acid residue  <dig> locates in the region of beta barrel that is far away from the helix region that binds to dna , indicating that the influence of the mutation on dna-binding is not due to the direct alteration in the helix region. however, in beta barrel structures the hydrophobic residues are oriented into the interior of the barrel to form a hydrophobic core and the stability of theβ-barrel depends largely on the interaction of the inner hydrophobic amino acid residues. the mutation from ala to val at aa  <dig> increases the hydrophobic property and subsequently stabilizes the dimeric structure of e <dig>  which is possibly responsible for the enhanced dna binding activities observed in the emsa.

previous study has showed that binding of the full-length wild-type bpv- <dig> e <dig> protein to the lcr sequences leads to formation of dna loops and the transcriptional activating domain of e <dig> is necessary for this loop  <cit> . such structure will result in the tissue-specific enhancers shifting closer to the core transcription complex for transcriptional activation  <cit> . meanwhile, some studies have indicated that binding of the intact e <dig> to the lcr sequences may spatially prevent the transcriptional machine to active the promoter, which are the main molecular mechanism for e <dig> transcriptional repression  <cit> .

e <dig> has also been shown to be able to interact with other cellular agents, e.g. brd <dig>  to regulate its transcriptional activity  <cit> . the identification of brd <dig> as a component in a dominant form of e <dig> complexes indicates that brd <dig> may be the cofactor for hpv e <dig> repressor function  <cit> . apparently, brd <dig> recruits e <dig> that in turn prevents the recruitment of tfiid and pol ii to the hpv promoter  <cit> . amino acid substitutions within the e <dig> transactivation domain impaired both the transcriptional activity and binding to brd <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, brd <dig> is a host chromatin adaptor for papillomavirus. the dimerization of the e <dig> is required for efficient brd <dig> binding  <cit> . the mutation from ala to val at aa  <dig> of hpv- <dig> e <dig>  which would change the hydrophobicity and/or tertiary structure of e <dig>  will lead to a modification of its interaction with the chromatin, and thus, modulates its transcriptional regulation activity. although our data highlight a close correlation between the increased activity for dna-binding and the enhanced activity for viral early promoters of the mutated e <dig> protein, the exact mechanism remains unclear.

our data indicate that the dna-binding capacity of the c-terminal fragment of e <dig> is stronger than those with the hinge region, and much stronger than the full-length e <dig>  earlier study has found that besides the full-length e <dig>  bovine papillomavirus  e <dig> orf also encodes two other e <dig> peptides, e2-tr and e8/e <dig> proteins  <cit> . these shorter e <dig> proteins contain the dna binding and dimerization domains of the c-terminus and hinge region, but lack the transactivation domain. relative abundances of the truncated e <dig> proteins have been observed in bpv transformed cells   <cit> . expression of hpv- <dig> e8e2c protein has been reported to be able to inhibit hela cell growth  <cit> . however, the transcriptional profiles of other hpv e <dig> orfs, regardless in benign or malignant cells, are rarely addressed. the fact that the c-terminus e <dig> binds dna stronger suggests that it is more competitive than the full-length e <dig> in the cells.

our study provides the evidence that hpv- <dig> e <dig>  regardless of wild-type or mutant , induces the similar biological effectiveness under the controls of the homologous and heterologous hpv lcrs. this suggests that e <dig> protein may induce same regulative activity on the viral early promoters from different hpvs with similar upstream components. although there are more than  <dig> genotypes of hpvs involving in various human benign or malignant proliferating diseases, the sequences of viral genomes are relatively conservative. hence, the effectiveness of hpv- <dig> e <dig> may represent a common property of hpvs' e <dig> proteins.

in addition to the role in regulating viral transcription, hpv e <dig> protein involves in enhancing e1-dependent viral dna replication and genome maintenance. in hpv genomes the viral dna replication initiation site co-localizes with the viral transcription region. however, the regulative function of e <dig> in viral dna replication is far from understood compared with its role in transcriptional regulation. although the point mutations in tad and in hinge region within this e <dig> mutant do not affect dna-binding and transcriptional regulation, their influence on viral genome replication cannot be excluded. sequences analyses of this variant hpv- <dig> strain have also identified several point mutations in its e <dig> orf. further studies of viral genome replication will help explore the inconvenient reason of such huge verrucae vulgaris.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provides evidence that hpv- <dig> e <dig> with ala to val mutation at aa  <dig> is critical for e <dig> dna-binding and its transcriptional regulation. the binding abilities of e <dig> proteins with a338v to either an artificial probe containing with two e <dig> binding sites or hpv- <dig> and hpv- <dig> promoter-proximal lcr sequences were significantly stronger than that of hpv- <dig> prototype e <dig>  furthermore, co-expression of the e <dig> constructs containing a338v mutation induces higher activities on heterologous hpv- <dig> early promoter p <dig> than that of prototype e <dig>
