BACKGROUND
acute lung injury , or its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome , induced by sepsis is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children  <cit> . ali is characterized by an extensive neutrophil influx into the lung, the expression of proinflammatory mediators and damage to the lung epithelium and endothelium. current clinical and experimental research on the treatment of lung injury is aimed at inhibiting different stages of this process with drugs or therapy, along with enhancing the body's own resistance, to delay or mitigate lung injury. however, the outcome of sepsis and septic shock cases has not been improved significantly. mortality in ali is still as high as 18%-27%, and the mortality rate of  is even higher to 29%-50%  <cit> . therefore, improved treatments and prevention strategies are needed to minimize the mortality associated with ali.

it is generally acknowledged that damage to membrane phospholipids leads to the collapse of the bronchial alveolar epithelial barrier during ali/ards. phospholipase a <dig> , a key enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids, plays a critical traumatic role in pulmonary inflammation through its influence on membrane signal transduction, biomembrane stability, activation of lipid mediators and leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion cascade formation. pla <dig> hydrolyzes the fatty acid from the sn- <dig> position of phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor and other inflammatory mediators  <cit> . in mammals, pla <dig> forms a large family of enzymes that can be schematically divided into two major classes: high-molecular-weight intracellular pla <dig>  and low-molecular-weight secretory pla <dig>  including spla2-iia. the former  is now generally considered to be a central enzyme mediating generation of eicosanoids and hence many inflammatory processes. the latter  is found at high levels in the circulation and locally in the tissues and has been suggested to play a role in a number of inflammatory diseases by regulating the synthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and platelet activating factor <cit> . especially, recent study showed that spla2-iia catalyzes the hydrolysis of surfactant phospholipids and suggested that this process can contribute to the loss of surface tension-lowering properties of surfactant  <cit> . clinically, spla2-iia offers new possibilities as an early marker for severe inflammation and predicting systemic complications in severely ill patients. thus, pla <dig> is regarded as the core and rate-limiting enzyme of inflammation and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lps-induced acute lung injury. specific inhibitors can be used to elucidate the roles of pla <dig> in cellular processes or to develop new potential therapeutics  <cit> . sato r reported  <cit>  that ly <dig>  <dig>  an exogenous inhibitor of spla <dig>  may exert a protective effect on lps-induced acute lung injury in male c57bl/6j mice.

clara cell secretory protein  is a 16-kda homodimeric protein that is secreted by non-ciliated bronchiolar  cells into the mucus lining the bronchial epithelium of the mammalian lung. it is one of the most abundant proteins in the airway mucus of mammals  <cit> . as a biomarker of clara cells and lung health, ccsp has been proposed as a useful diagnostic marker of toxicant exposure or airway epithelial damage. some studies have reported that administration of exogenous ccsp such as recombinant human ccsp to the lungs mitigates inflammation  <cit> . although evidence points to antioxidant  <cit> , anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, anti-cytokine, pollutant clearance, anti-fibrosis, anti-tumor invasion and anti-protease activity  <cit> , its endogenous mechanism is not known. studies on ccsp-deficient mice have indicated that ccsp acts as an endogenous inhibitor of pla <dig>  <cit>  by binding calcium, a cofactor for secretory pla <dig> activation, or phosphatidylcholine, a substrate of pla <dig>  <cit> .

polydatin , also known as polygonin, is a type of polyphenolic phytoalexin with strong antioxidative activity that is isolated from a variety of plant species and also can be readily synthesized  <cit> . one of the richest sources of this monocrystalline compound is the roots of polygonum cuspidatum sieb, a weed widely used in traditional chinese and japanese medicine. its chemical name is  <dig>  4', 5-trihydroxystilbene-3-β-single-d-glucoside  <cit>  . pd exhibits multiple biological activities and pharmacological effects, such as protection of the heart  <cit> , brain  <cit>  and liver  <cit> , improving microcirculation  <cit> , inhibiting platelet aggregation  <cit> , combating shock  <cit> , anti-asthmatic, microbial resistance, and anti-cancer activities. in  <dig>  pd was evaluated by the state food and drug administration of china and became one of the new drugs approved for further testing in phase ii clinical trials.

our previous experimental results indicate that polydatin has prophylactic and therapeutic effects  on acutely injured lungs in rats with endotoxic shock by inhibiting phospholipase a <dig> activity and the gene expression of secretory phospholipase a <dig> type ii a   <cit> . phospholipase a <dig> activity and spla2-iia expression are increased by endotoxin injection, but treatment with polydatin inhibits these increases. in our preliminary experiments, obvious morphological evidence was found in pathological lung sections, and the protective effect of pd was most obvious in lung from rats pretreated with pd. these early results suggest that pd may act as a phospholipase a <dig> inhibitor to inhibit the activation and activity of pla <dig>  however, the potential mechanism is not yet fully understood. therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether polydatin can up-regulate the expression of ccsp and inhibit pla <dig> to suppress lps-induced lung injury.

RESULTS
polydatin up-regulates ccsp mrna expression in rat lung
a significant decrease ccsp mrna expression was observed only in the endotoxic shock group five hours after lps injection . pd can increase ccsp mrna expression not only in normal rat lung  but also in rat lung following endotoxic shock. moreover, ccsp mrna level in the pd pretreatment group was significantly higher  than in the pd treatment group . pd increased ccsp mrna expression in a dose-dependent manner .

polydatin down-regulates spla <dig> and cpla <dig> mrna expression in rat lung
because ccsp was the potential inhibitor of pla <dig>  we investigated the effects of pd on pla <dig> along with ccsp. pd could down-regulate the levels of spla <dig> and cpla <dig> mrna expressions in normal rat lung . not only that, pd could decrease the levels of spla <dig> and cpla <dig> mrna expressions of rat lung induced by lps , in a dose-dependent manner . the expression of spla <dig> and cpla <dig> in pd pretreatment group was lower than in pd treatment group .

polydatin up-regulates ccsp protein expression in rat lung
to investigate whether ccsp protein expression changed with its mrna expression synchronously, we detected ccsp protein in lung by western blot. the results indicated that lps not only inhibited the protein expression of ccsp but also that pd treatment and pd pretreatment increased the level of ccsp markedly . in particular, ccsp protein in the pretreatment and pd control groups was significantly higher than in the sham operation group . ccsp protein expression in the pd pretreatment group was higher than in pd treatment group . thus, pd increased ccsp protein expression in a dose-dependent manner .

polydatin down-regulates serum ccsp level in rat
ccsp can transfer from lung tissue into the blood serum. serum ccsp level is closely related to its synthesis and secretion by clara cells in the respiratory tract, and serum ccsp level may act as a marker of the bronchoalveolar blood-gas barrier integrity and permeability  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  serum ccsp level in the endotoxin shock group was significantly higher than in the sham operation group. however, ccsp levels in the pd treatment and pd pretreatment groups were lower than in the endotoxic shock group . serum ccsp level decreased with increasing pd dose . therefore, pd decreased ccsp transference from lung to serum in a dose-dependent manner.

polydatin increases the percentage of ccsp-positive cells
in rat lung slices, ccsp-positive cells are non-ciliated epithelial cells, namely, clara cells. the relative ccsp-positive airway epithelial cell proportions were as follows. compared with the sham operation group, ccsp-positive cells were decreased in the endotoxic shock model group and increased in the pd control group . compared with the lps group, ccsp-positive cells were increased in the pd treatment and pretreatment groups . thus, pd increased ccsp-positive cells in lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner .

i: sham operation group; ii: endotoxic shock group; iii: pd treatment group; iv: pd pretreatment group; v: pd control group. bp <  <dig>  and cp <  <dig>  vs. group i; ep <  <dig>  and fp <  <dig>  vs. group ii.

bp <  <dig>  and cp <  <dig>  vs.  <dig> mg·kg- <dig> pd group, fp <  <dig>  vs.  <dig> mg·kg-1pd group, ip <  <dig>  and jp <  <dig>  vs.  <dig> mg·kg- <dig> pd group.

polydatin up-regulates ccsp expression in beas-2b
the mtt assay suggested that the most suitable concentration of pd to use in beas-2b cells was  <dig>  mmol/l and the most suitable concentration of lps was  <dig> ng·ml- <dig>  in vitro, lps led to reduced ccsp expression in beas-2b cells, while pd promoted ccsp expression, not only in normal beas-2b cells but also in lps-induced beas-2b cells . in addition, ccsp expression in the pd pretreatment group was greater than in the pd treatment group .

discussion
there are many experimental models of acute lung injury, but none of them completely reproduces all the prominent features of human ali/ards, such as alveolar neutrophilia , hyaline membrane deposition  and microthrombi . hence, there is no single "best" model of lung injury; instead, the best model will be one that reproduces the features to be tested in the investigator's hypothesis.

we used one of the well-established rat models of acute lung injury, intravenous administration of lps because it can lead to activation of various inflammatory mediators such as phospholipase a <dig>  these mediators may cause epithelial lesions and increase the alveolocapillary barrier permeability. therefore, this model met all the requirements for our purpose.

first, we observed a reduction of ccsp mrna in parallel with decreased ccsp protein expression in rat lung tissue after lps stimulation for five hours. prior to this, we knew that different inflammatory stimuli result in different ccsp expression patterns in lung. inhalation of o <dig> and injection of phenyl isothiocyanate can induce acute and chronic inflammation in humans and increase ccsp expression in lung  <cit> . by contrast, ccsp production is decreased during acute and chronic lung injury caused by viral and bacterial infections, smoking  <cit>  or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. all of these factors make the role of ccsp in the inflammatory process more complex. moreover, ccsp expression may result in tissue damage caused by inflammatory factors, rather than the inflammation itself  <cit> . it is most likely that up-regulation of ccsp expression is a result of the body's self-protection mechanism in the early stages of the inflammatory response, but suppression of ccsp expression follows during the later inflammatory response. ccsp expression is down-regulated after acute lung inflammation induced by intratracheal or intravenous lps administration  <cit> . our results are in agreement with these previous experimental observations. the finding that lps reduces ccsp expression should provide an excellent foundation for future research.

second, polydatin increased the ccsp-positive cell percentage and up-regulated ccsp mrna and protein expression in lung tissue during acute lung injury induced by lps. ccsp expression was increased along with pd increasing. there was a dose-effect relationship between pd and ccsp expression within our observational dose range. additionally, ccsp protein expression was consistent with its mrna level. some possible mechanism by which pd promotes ccsp expression can be explained as follows: 1) pd can increase the number of ccsp-positive cells ; 2) pd can promote the secretion of ccsp in individual clara cells to increase total ccsp expression; and 3) most importantly, pd can enhance the stability of ccsp. the reduction of ccsp degradation is an important factor in increasing ccsp level. pd can help to keep the bronchoalveolar blood-gas barrier integrity and decrease the bronchoalveolar blood-gas barrier permeability induced by lps so that ccsp will not be decomposed in serum. berg et al  <cit>  have reported that glucocorticoids regulate the ccsp promoter via c/ebp beta and -delta in lung cells. ramsay et al.  <cit>  have indicated that ifn-γ can up-regulate the expression of ccsp in rat and rabbit lung tissue. the reported mechanisms are as follows: 1) regulation of the th1/th <dig> cytokine network to increase ccsp mrna expression; 2) hormone receptor and ifn-γbinding sites exist in the 5'-flanking region of the ccsp gene, which can directly promote the transcription of the ccsp gene and increase the synthesis and secretion of ccsp; and 3) increased stability of ccsp mrna at the post-transcriptional level. therefore, our future research will be focused on the effect of polydatin on the transcription of ccsp.

third, ccsp expression in lung in the pd pretreatment group was greater than in the pd treatment group. this result suggests that a competitive inhibition of ccsp exists between pd and lps. therefore, we propose that pd and lps have a common binding site in clara cells that can influence the secretion of ccsp. however, the specific mechanism remains unclear, and the intrinsic link between pd and ccsp requires further investigation.

fourth, based on animal experiments, the beas-2b cell line was chosen as the model to study the effect of pd on ccsp in vitro. beas-2b cells are clara cells that have been transformed by the sv <dig> t-antigen. beas-2b is the most commonly used model for ccsp research  <cit> . the human ccsp gene exists as a single copy in beas-2b cells. tumor necrosis factor-α  can induce a change in chromosome structure that enhances the stability of an rna-binding protein involved in transcriptional regulation, which increases ccsp gene expression in beas-2b cells  <cit> . kim et al.  <cit>  have reported that il- <dig> and other indirectly acting proteins can promote the expression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor  so as to increase ccsp expression in airway epithelium. we found that ccsp can be expressed in and secreted by beas-2b cells in culture medium. lps can decrease ccsp expression in beas-2b cells, while pd can promote the expression of ccsp in normal and lps-stimulated cells, and the change in mrna is consistent with ccsp protein expression. pd may enhance the proliferation of clara cells and it may enhance the proliferation of ccsp-positive/pro-surfactant protein c pro-spc-positive cells  <cit> .

as far as the limitation of this research work was concerned, we just observed that polydatin suppressed pla <dig> of lung induced by lps through up-regulating clara cell secretory protein. the intrinsic relationship between pd and ccsp need further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that pd can modulate ccsp expression to inhibit pla <dig>  this inhibition is probably a crucial protection mechanism of pd in lps-induced acute lung injury. these findings provide compelling evidence for the potential efficacy of pd in clinical use, although the molecular mechanisms of its action need further exploration.
