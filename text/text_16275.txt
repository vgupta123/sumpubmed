BACKGROUND
the receptor tyrosine kinase erbb <dig> is over-expressed in approximately 30% of human breast carcinomas  <cit>  and is a marker of poor prognosis  <cit> . several transgenic mouse models over-expressing human her <dig> or rat neu, have highlighted the similarities between erbb2/neu-mediated oncogenesis in murine models and human breast cancer  <cit> . the effects of erbb <dig> mediated oncogenic transformation on breast epithelial biology have been faithfully modeled using 3d reconstituted basement membrane  culture systems  <cit> . activation of erbb <dig> via receptor dimerization, generates tyrosine-phosphorylated recognition motifs, binding of sh2-domain signaling proteins, that transmit proliferative/survival signals via multiple pathways, including the shc- and/or grb2-activated ras-raf-mapk and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase  pathways . although the mechanisms by which erbb <dig> deregulates these pro-mitogenic/survival signaling networks have been well characterized, how erbb <dig> signaling might influence the cellular translation machinery to propagate its oncogenic effects is still poorly understood.

the initiation factor eif <dig> participates in a rate-limiting step during the initiation of translation, namely the formation of the ternary complex  and aug initiation codon recognition. the role of eif2α phosphorylation during transformation by oncogenes like erbb <dig> is poorly understood. gtp-bound eif <dig> interacts with the initiator methionyl trna to form a ternary complex  followed by binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit. phosphorylation of the α subunit of eif <dig> at ser- <dig> sequesters it in an inactive gdp-bound complex with its gtp-exchange factor, eif2b, resulting in attenuation of translation initiation  <cit> . phosphorylation of eif2α can occur in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er lumen to limit protein synthesis and relieve the er load  <cit> . still, gene expression is required for translating genes that help cells cope with er stress and also resume normal cell function. thus, eif2α phosphorylation favors the translation of the transcription factor atf <dig>  which triggers a transcriptional response to cope with er and oxidative stress. further, in a negative feedback loop, eif2α signaling induces gadd <dig>  the regulatory subunit of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase  <dig> , which directs pp1c to dephosphorylate its substrate eif2α. this allows cells to restore normal eif2α phosphorylation and normal protein synthesis  <cit> .

cancer cells can enhance general and preferential translation of specific mrnas coding forproteins that stimulate proliferation or inhibit apoptosis . for example, erbb <dig> can enhance c-myc protein synthesis <cit>  and increase src translation via the akt/mtor/4ebp- <dig> pathway  <cit> . in addition, erbb <dig> itself is post-transcriptionally regulated  <cit> . further, ras signaling, which erbb <dig> can activate, can cause robust recruitment of mrnas for efficient translation even if transcription of the same mrnas is not enhanced  <cit> . thus, increased translation of multiple mrnas may allow oncogenes to rapidly stimulate growth and/or adapt to growth/survival conditions. however, how erbb <dig> signaling cross talks with eif2α signaling has not been investigated in depth.

the role of eif2α in oncogenesis has been established by studies which demonstrated that overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant of eif2α <cit>  or a dominant-negative eif2α kinase  <cit>  were sufficient to transform cells. we showed that persistent phosphorylation of eif2α by its upstream kinase perk inhibits proliferation of human mammary epithelial and squamous carcinoma cells exerting growth suppressive effects in vivo  <cit> . we also showed that enhancement of eif2α phosphorylation with the small molecule inhibitor of gadd34-pp1c complex, salubrinal, can inhibit tumor growth of head and neck carcinoma hep <dig>  colon carcinoma sw <dig> and multiple myeloma rpmi <dig> and u266b <dig> cells  <cit> . here we sought to determine whether  signaling by erbb <dig> might modulate eif2α phosphorylation and/or  whether enhancement of eif2α phosphorylation might limit growth by erbb <dig> oncogenic signaling. we studied these possibilities in mcf10a cells overexpressing wild type or constitutively activated  erbb <dig> and in primary cultures from mmtv-neu mouse tumors. these oncogenes lead to phenotypes similar to dcis  and invasive lesions  where hyper-proliferation and disruption of mammary acinar morphogenesis are observed.

RESULTS
erbb2/neu disruption of normal mammary acinar morphogenesis
we generated mcf10a cells stably expressing either a wild-type c-neu proto-oncogene  or a constitutively active variant of c-neu . the ca-erbb <dig> form has a single point mutation in the trans-membrane domain of the receptor, which results in a val to glu substitution at position  <dig>  <cit>  and increased transforming capacity compared to the wild-type receptor  <cit> . control mcf10a cells , formed spheroids with a hollow lumen surrounded by a polarized basal layer of cells in matrigel . in contrast, expression of wt-erbb <dig> resulted in much larger, lumen-filled acinar structures by day  <dig> in matrigel . these structures although clearly disorganized and larger were confined and did not show outward invasion into the surrounding matrix. these resembled ductal carcinoma in situ  structures where there is loss of epithelial organization but no invasion of the surrounding tissue <cit>  . expression of ca-erbb <dig>  resulted in even larger, highly disorganized, lumen-filled multi-acinar structures , suggesting a dose-dependent effect of erbb <dig> signaling on deregulation of acinar development. these structures frequently showed cells invading the surrounding matrix . thus, the ca-erbb <dig> expressing cells appear to be to some extent more migratory and invasive, like observed in invasive carcinomas  <cit> . immunoblots confirmed that the neu/erbb <dig> protein was highly expressed in both wt and ca-erbb <dig> cell lines . further, erbb <dig> phosphorylation at y- <dig> and y- <dig> residues, known to be auto-phosphorylated during homodimerization of erbb <dig> receptors, were readily detected  <cit> . the levels of total erbb <dig> were slightly higher in wt- than caerbb <dig> cells. still erbb <dig> phosphorylation at residues pty1221/ <dig> was strong . erbb <dig> over-expression was functional since we observed an approximately 6-fold increase in p-ser  <dig> of akt, and a  <dig>  fold increase in p-erk 1/ <dig> levels in ca-erbb <dig> cells compared to vector control , indicating that overexpression of erbb2/neu receptors initiated downstream mitogenic signaling. with this model that provides defined pathways readouts and phenotypic endpoints we tested whether eif2α signaling was modulated by the oncogenes and whether forced enhancement of eif2α phosphorylation affects erbb <dig> modulation of acinar morphogenesis in this system.

effect of erbb <dig> activation on basal eif2α phosphorylation and expression of atf <dig> and chop/gadd153
using the model described in fig.  <dig> we tested whether eif2α signaling was modulated by erbb <dig> overexpression. we observed no significant modulation of phospho-eif2α or total eif2α levels in either wt or ca-erbb <dig> cells compared to control cells as measured by immunoblotting . although we observed a trend towards enhanced perk phopshorylation in the ca-erbb <dig> cells vs. wt-erbb <dig> and β-gal cells it was not statistically significant when comparing at least  <dig> independent experiments . in agreement, with these results, we found no significant changes in basal atf <dig> protein levels between wt or ca-erbb <dig> cells and control cells . thus, erbb <dig> signaling in 2d mmonolayers does not seem to significantly modulate the basal phosphorylation of perk, eif2α and atf <dig> expression for deregulation of acinar morphogenesis.

we next determined whether expression of the downstream target of eif2α signaling chop/gadd <dig> might be modulated by erbb <dig> overexpression in mcf10a cells. acini that were grown for 8- <dig> days in matrigel, when luminal clearing is initiated and apoptosis is evident  <cit> , were stained for chop expression. as reported previously  <cit> , we could detect chop positive cells within vector control acinar structures and the signal largely localized within the central luminal space. we next used lscm to quantify the number of chop positive cells per acini. a slight but statistically non-significant trend towards less chop staining was observed in non-invasive wterbb <dig> structures compared to control acini and this signal was randomly localized in the acini, possibly due to the already deregulated architecture of these structures . in contrast, invasive ca-erbb <dig> cell aggregates showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of cells positively stained for chop . we conclude that increased erbb <dig> signaling while not affecting basal phosphorylation of perk and eif2α or atf <dig> expression, appears to downregulate chop expression in the more invasive structures induced by ca-erbb <dig> 

salubrinal increases phospho-eif2α levels and significantly restricts erbb2-deregulated acinar growth
the downregulation of chop in ca-erbb <dig> structures suggested that perhaps erbb <dig> signaling uncouples eif2α phosphorylation from chop induction and its growth inhibitory function. however, the cells might still be sensitive to higher levels of eif2α phosphorylation. thus, we next tested whether erbb <dig> oncogenic signaling could be counteracted upon forced eif2α phosphorylation or whether it might still bypass the growth inhibitory function of this pathway  <cit> . to this end we used salubrinal, a recently discovered small molecule inhibitor shown to disrupt the gadd34-pp <dig> phosphatase complex  <cit>  and persistently induce high p-eif2α levels. four days after seeding in matrigel cells were treated with a low dose of salubrinal  until days  <dig> or  <dig>  treatment with salubrinal at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs did not compromise cell viability  but negatively affected growth of wt and ca-erbb <dig> acini in adhered monolayer conditions . this effect was much more striking in matrigel, where we observed that salubrinal treatment significantly reduced acinar size and growth in matrigel . compared to untreated controls, salubrinal-treated wt-erbb <dig> cells formed smaller, more organized growth-arrested acini and also appeared to restore to some extent their normal organization. in ca-erbb <dig> structures salubrinal treatment significantly reduced overall acinar size but did not seem to almost fully restore normal acinar architecture and block local invasion. salubrinal treatment did not grossly affect the growth and organization of vector control acini, although a slight reduction in overall size was observed . we confirmed that treatment with this low dose of salubrinal  was sufficient to enhance basal eif2α phosphorylation  in vector, wt and ca-erbb <dig> cells, as early as  <dig> hrs after treatment and which could be maintained with daily salubrinal treatment up to  <dig> hrs . attempts to detect enhanced phopshorylation of eif2α in 3d acini showed a general staining pattern throughout the acini which was not specific for basal or luminal cells and enhancement through tunicamycin showed an enhanced signal that could not be specifically assigned to luminal or basal cells, making the results based on staining intensity more difficult to interpret . to estimate the size differences between 8-day old vector, wt-erbb <dig> and ca-erbb <dig> acini, two perpendicular acinar diameters were measured using calibrated software  <cit>  and the volumes of individual acini were calculated, considering an ellipsoid morphology . the large acinar size in wt-erbb <dig> and ca-erbb <dig>  was markedly reduced by persistent treatment with salubrinal. quantification of the distribution of acinar sizes over several volume ranges showed that in untreated vector controls, less than  <dig> percent of acini exceeded the  <dig> - <dig> × 10- <dig> mm <dig> volume range  and salubrinal treatment maintained acinar size below this range . in contrast, a large proportion  of untreated wt and ca-erbb <dig> acini exceeded the  <dig> - <dig> × 10- <dig> mm <dig> volume range. treatment with salubrinal considerably reduced the frequency of these larger acini and shifted the majority of acini towards the smaller volume ranges  . these findings demonstrate that erbb2-induced deregulation of mammary acinar development can be suppressed by inhibiting eif2α dephosphorylation with salubrinal.

differential proliferative and apoptotic responses to salubrinal by wt vs. ca-erbb <dig> expressing acini
the decrease in acinar sizes observed with salubrinal could result from decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis or a combination of both. to test whether salubrinal caused a reduction in cell proliferation, vector, wt and ca-erbb <dig> acini were treated with salubrinal from day 4- <dig> in matrigel, fixed and stained for ki- <dig> . the percentage of ki- <dig> positive cells per acinus was estimated using standard immunofluorescence and lscm  <cit> . untreated vector acini showed ki- <dig> positive cells mainly located in the basal layer of epithelial cells  and this was not affected by salubrinal treatment  suggesting that the slight decrease in vector acini size is not attributable to reduced proliferation. ca-erbb <dig> overexpression caused a noticeable increase in the percent of ki <dig> positive cells compared to empty vector control acini . in all cases ki <dig> positive cells were found both in the outer rim as well as among the cells occupying the central luminal space . salubrinal treatment of wt-erbb <dig> acini caused a statistically significant reduction in ki <dig>  and phospho-h <dig>  staining at day  <dig> of acinar growth, suggesting an initial inhibition of proliferation . however, these differences disappeared at day  <dig> and day  <dig> , suggesting that at these time points salubrinal only marginally impacts proliferation; we could also detect smaller sized acini still containing many positively stained cells . in contrast, a statistically significant decrease in ki- <dig> staining was observed in ca-erbb <dig> acini . thus, it appears that both wt-erbb <dig> and ca-erbb <dig> are susceptible to salubrinal inhibition of proliferation, except that this effect is only observed during early phases of acinar development in wt-erbb <dig> cells and throughout the growth phases for ca-erbb <dig> cells.

in wt-erbb <dig> acini decreased acinar size could only be partially explained by reduced proliferation in response to salubrinal treatment. thus, we tested whether apoptosis was being modulated by sustained eif2α phosphorylation. in this case cleaved caspase- <dig> staining was used as a marker of apoptosis  <cit> . our results revealed that sustained treatment with salubrinal resulted in a significant increase in cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells that localized mainly to the central luminal space in vector control and wt-erbb <dig> acini  and at a lower frequency along the periphery in ca-erbb <dig> acini . quantification of the percentage of cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells per acinus revealed that vector and wt-erbb <dig> acini displayed similar rates of apoptosis under basal untreated conditions while constitutively active erbb <dig> signaling displayed approximately  <dig> -fold less cell death further highlighting the stronger potency of this mutant erbb <dig> receptor . salubrinal treatment significantly enhanced the number of cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells/acini in all three-cell types, albeit to different extents. in vector and in wt-erbb <dig> acini the induction was between 5- <dig> fold. in contrast, in salubrinal-treated ca-erbb <dig> acini, the fold induction of apoptosis was much lower  compared to untreated cells, although still statistically significant . of note is the fact that although salubrinal enhanced luminal apoptosis in wt-erbb <dig> structures, this did not seem to affect the basal layer of viable cells but rather accelerated luminal apoptosis, a normal occurrence during acinar development. thus, these structures that resemble dcis can be forced into a more differentiated or normal architecture by enhancing eif2α phosphorylation salubrinal did not affect the levels of bimel, a pro-apoptotic protein implicated in lumen formation  <cit>   indicating that apoptosis might proceed via selective activation of other pro-apoptotic phospho-eif2α targets or via autophagic death  <cit> . our results suggest that salubrinal treatment can counteract the erbb2-mediated deregulation of morphogenesis in 3d-culture by inhibiting early proliferation, accelerating apoptosis and enhancing luminal clearing in wt-erbb <dig> over-expressing cells. in ca-erbb <dig> cells, inhibition of proliferation is primarily responsible for reduced acinar growth and size.

we next tested whether the effect of salubrinal was limited to the mcf10a model. treatment with salubrinal of control normal mammary epithelial cells from fvb mice were grown in matrigel. in these cells, like in parental mcf10a, salubrinal had minor effects on morphogenesis in 3d . further, in agreement with our results in mcf10a cells overexpressing erbb <dig>  mmtv-neu cells obtained from spontaneous tumors that arose in these mice formed dramatically enlarged structures devoid of proper tissue architecture and with a filled lumen . however, treatment with salubrinal strongly inhibited expansion of these deregulated structures reducing their size in a statistically significant manner and favoring cavitation and proper lumen formation .

salubrinal-mediated inhibition of acinar growth correlates with increased expression of chop and reduced cyclin d <dig> levels
we first tested whether salubrinal might affect total erbb <dig> protein levels. western blot analysis showed that salubrinal had no effect on erbb <dig> protein expression or its downstream targets akt and erk1/ <dig>  indicating that the growth inhibitory effect of salubrinal is not due to a decrease in total erbb <dig> or downstream target protein levels. salubrinal did not modulate phospho-ser473-akt  or phospho-t202/y204-erk1/ <dig> levels at  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hrs , indicating that its growth suppressive effects were not due to reduced activation or non-specific regulation of these signaling components.

chop induction is dependent of eif2α phosphorylation, mediates er stress-induced growth arrest and apoptosis and can be up-regulated by salubrinal treatment  <cit> . chop staining was used as surrogate phenotypic readout for phospho-eif2α signaling and the number of chop positive cells per acinus was quantified using lscm as in fig.  <dig>  our results showed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of chop-positive cells in vector and wt-erbb <dig> acini after salubrinal treatment . in contrast, ca-erbb <dig> acini were able to bypass the salubrinal-mediated induction of chop. these results indicate that the increase in chop expression coincides with the induction of acinar apoptosis in vector acini and wt-erbb <dig> structures. in ca-erbb2-expressing cells this mutant oncogene appears to block apoptosis and this associates with less chop induction. this suggests that prolonged treatment with salubrinal might induce a state of quiescence in these cells.

cyclin d <dig> has previously been shown to be a major mediator of erbb2-induced tumor cell proliferation and oncogenesis  <cit> . when compared to vector control mcf10a cells, cyclin d <dig> levels were significantly increased in wt and to an even greater extent in ca-erbb <dig> cells . this paralleled the increased rates of proliferation in 3d cultures . cyclin d <dig> levels were previously shown to be downregulated upon treatment with a derivative of salubrinal  and by inducible activation of a dimerizing fv2e-perk protein  <cit> . we thus determined whether reduced cell proliferation was partly attributable to a salubrinal-induced decrease in cyclin d <dig> levels. we found that sustained salubrinal treatment for  <dig> hrs resulted in a  <dig> -fold and approximately  <dig> -fold decrease in cyclin d <dig> protein levels in treated wt-erbb <dig> and ca-erbb <dig> cells, respectively, compared to untreated cells . this decrease in cyclin d <dig> was also evident as early as  <dig> hrs post treatment . we conclude that sustained eif2α phosphorylation results in the induction of chop and downregulation of cyclin d <dig> which could further account for the reduced proliferation and smaller acinar size in salubrinal-treated erbb <dig> acini.

discussion
we established a model where acquisition of phenotypes that resembled dcis or invasive carcinoma can be mimicked by expressing the wt-erbb <dig> and a ca-erbb <dig>  respectively. in this model we set out to determine whether erbb <dig> over-expression was linked to modulation of eif2α phosphorylation and downstream pathway induction. our results show that there is a dependence of erbb <dig> signaling on eif2α phosphorylation to promote deregulation of mammary acinar morphogenesis in 3d cultures. we found that both wt- and ca-erbb <dig> did not significantly modulate basal perk or eif2α phosphorylation. consistently, the expression of an eif2α downstream target atf <dig> also remained unchanged. conversly expression of the atf <dig> target gene chop, was decreased but only in invasive ca-erbb <dig> expressing structures. possible explanations for this uncoupling are that atf <dig> activity may be reduced by erbb <dig> signaling, that other transcription factors that regulate chop expression, such as atf <dig>  <cit>  might be inhibited by ca-erbb <dig> or that this oncogene induces the rapid degradation of chop protein. that chop is down regulated by erbb <dig> is similar to that observed with ras and consistent with its function in inducing growth arrest and/or apoptosis  <cit> . thus, erbb <dig> signaling may uncouple eif2α-atf <dig> signaling from the deleterious effects of chop.

we found that as opposed to normal mcf10a or mouse mecs, erbb <dig> overexpressing human or mouse  mecs were very sensitive to enhanced eif2α phosphorylation. this was supported by the fact that salubrinal treatment and increased eif2α phosphorylation strongly inhibited wt- or ca-erbb <dig> deregulation of mcf10a acinar morphogenesis. this was also evident in mmtv-neu induced structures that cavitated and reduced their size upon salubrinal treatment. however, depending on the intensity of erbb <dig> signaling, salubrinal treatment achieved inhibition of the deregulated acinar morphogenesis via different mechanisms. in wt-erbb <dig> over expressing acini, which resemble structures observed in dcis, salubrinal treatment was largely associated with early inhibition of proliferation  that was lost at later time points  of morphogenesis when a strong induction of apoptosis was detected. interestingly, this apoptosis occurred mostly in the luminal population of cells, stressing the specificity of this signal to the luminal compartment. notably, salubrinal treatment could accelerate the normal process of luminal clearing which fails to occur during erbb <dig> oncogenesis  <cit> . these results also suggested that salubrinal did not randomly exert toxic effects on all cells within the acini but that it rather accelerated luminal clearing without compromising the viability of basal cells within these structures. the induction of apoptosis also correlated with enhanced luminal cleaved caspase- <dig> positive cells and enhanced chop induction. further, studies are required to elucidate the precise apoptotic pathways that are activated by salubrinal treatment. together these findings suggest that erbb <dig> positive cancer cells in lesions like dcis might be particularly sensitive to therapeutic drugs that enhance eif2α phosphorylation.

in ca-erbb <dig> acinar structures, which resembled invasive lesions, salubrinal treatment also strongly inhibited growth but mainly through inhibition of proliferation. apoptosis although induced, was of a much lower magnitude. activated erbb <dig> cells showed stronger activation of akt signaling that was not affected by salubrinal treatment . this suggests that enhanced akt signaling might in part allow these cells to resist the growth-inhibitory effects of salubrinal treatment possibly by entering a state of quiescence. the decrease in cyclin d <dig> levels in ca-erbb <dig> cells was also of a lower magnitude compared to wt-erbb <dig>  suggesting that the growth arrest was not entirely dependent on down-regulation of this cell cycle protein. total protein levels of phospho- or total erbb <dig>  akt and erk1/ <dig> were unchanged, highlighting the selective and specific mode of action of salubrinal. however, we can not rule out that other target genes for gadd34-pp1c  <cit>  might be affected by salubrinal. it will be important to determine whether phospho-mimetic mutants of eif2α or the use of the fv2e-perk fusion protein also generate the same effects as salubrinal.

we recently showed that chronic inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation by perk dominant negative mutants in mcf10a cells results in acinar deregulation and hyperplastic benign growth in vivo  <cit> . thus, perturbations that ablate the growth inhibitory function of perk-eif2α signaling can favor benign tumor formation. here we show that preventing eif2α dephosphorylation can severely compromise the oncogenic effects of erbb <dig> signaling. together these studies support the notion that increases in eif2α phosphorylation and signaling above a certain threshold can be growth inhibitory in cancer cells. our data allows us to entertain the possibility that the process of transformation requires cells to dynamically remodel eif2α phosphorylation status to favor survival and cells compromised in the ability to do so  may be negatively selected. for example, oncogene-induced senescence in normal melanocytes requires eif2α signaling  <cit> . it is possible then that only those cells able to adapt the eif2α pathway to their advantage, that is maintain a more plastic remodeling of the eif2α pathway without reaching very high or persistent phospho-eif2α levels, go on to be transformed. we therefore predict that cells that escape erbb2-induced senescence, might co-opt eif2α phosphorylation and downstream signaling for survival.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that while erbb <dig> signaling does not seem to significantly modulate eif2α phosphorylation at ser <dig> tumor cells overexpressing this oncogene are highly sensitive to the effects of hyper-phosphorylated eif2α levels. in contrast, normal mecs are marginally sensitive to salubrinal treatment. we recently showed that doses of salubrinal that have no effect on basal multiple myeloma viability greatly sensitize these cells to bortezomib  treatment in conjunction or after bortezomib treatment  <cit> . our present work describes a previously unrecognized approach for targeting the hyper-proliferation induced by erbb <dig> via pharmacological activation of eif2α signaling. therapeutic treatments targeting the eif2α pathway may prove, alone or in combination with other targeted therapies, to be useful in the treatment of cancers over-expressing erbb <dig>  this and the fact that salubrinal or more powerful derivates like sal <dig> do not appear to have significant toxicities in murine models may warrant further investigation into whether salubrinal or similar molecules that target gadd34-pp1c could be used to treat breast cancers with amplified erbb <dig>
