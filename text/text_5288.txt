BACKGROUND
when blood flow is decreased to the brain, cerebral ischemia, a complex signaling network is activated. excitotoxicity can be induced by an increase in intraneuronal ca2+ through calcium ion channels, such as the n-methyl-d-aspartic acid  receptor, l-type voltage-gated calcium channels  and ip <dig> receptor. an influx in intraneuronal ca2+ is a key mediator in multiple intracellular signaling cascades after ischemia  <cit> . extracellular signal – regulated kinase , a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase  family, is activated in a ca2+-dependent manner in cerebral ischemia  <cit> . erk is regulated via phosphorylation at various motifs. previous studies have demonstrated that erk is activated by various upstream kinases, such as akt and src, by the raf/mek/erk signaling cascade  <cit> . in response to ischemic stimuli, active src kinase activates erk through raf phosphorylation at tyr340/tyr <dig>  <cit> . src is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase . the src family of proteins contain a src homology   <dig> domain and sh <dig> domain, a catalytic domain, and a c-terminal tail. src maintains basal activity in normal cells by an auto-inhibitory mechanism, whereby tyr <dig> in the c-terminal tail is phosphorylated allowing for association with the sh <dig> domain preventing catalytic activity. src activation is initiated when tyr <dig> is dephosphorylated and, subsequently, autophosphorylated at tyr- <dig>  <cit> .

in general, changes in protein phosphorylation require coordinate regulation of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. however, to date, the signaling mechanisms leading to dephosphorylation of erk resulting in inactivation have not been well defined. protein phosphotase 2a  has been shown to be an erk phosphatase. furthermore, it has been suggested that pp2a dephosphorylates critical residues resulting in erk inactivation  <cit> . pp2a is a ser/thr-specific phosphatase composed of two regulatory  and one catalytic subunit   <cit> . the catalytic subunit of pp2a  is regulated by phosphorylation at tyr <dig> in the conserved c-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit resulting in inactivation of the enzyme  <cit> . active src can directly phosphorylate pp2a c at tyr <dig>  <cit>  and cerebral ischemia leads to up-regulation of src activity  <cit> . however, whether src kinase induces erk activation through inhibition of pp2a during cerebral ischemia is unclear.

following ischemia, the activated erk cascade regulates gene expression via upregulation of specific transcription factors  <cit> . one of the upregulated targets is estrogen receptor α , a neuroprotector. it has been reported that erα phosphorylation at ser <dig> positively regulates its function and that phospho-erk phosphorylates this residue  <cit> . another neuroprotective protein induced by erk activation is cyclic amp response element-binding protein . additionally, erk phosphorylates creb at ser <dig>  which is essential for creb-mediated effects on transcription  <cit> . interestingly, this residue has been shown to be dephosphorylated by pp2a  <cit> .

therefore, in the present study, we examine the involvement of pp2a in src-dependent erk phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus following ischemia. through the use of su <dig> , a src inhibitor, we show that pp2a activity is upregulated, which may, in turn, attenuate erk activation and its downstream proteins, creb and erα, in the post-ischemic hippocampus. thus, we propose that src induces erk activation through downregulation of pp2a activity in cerebral ischemia.

RESULTS
src inhibitor decreases activity of the erk/creb and erα pathways post-ischemia
erk can be expressed widely and is found in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus  <cit> . some previous studies have suggested that the erk signaling cascade may be up-regulated in a src-dependent manner following cerebral ischemia  <cit> . therefore, it was determined if src kinase regulates erk activity at different and specific subcellular sites in response to ischemic stimuli. erk and p-erk were measured by immunoblot in defined subcellular regions, including the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. su <dig>  was used to inhibit src activity. rats underwent 4-vo and endured  <dig> min ischemia followed by  <dig> h reperfusion. ischemia leads to phosphorylation of erk during the  <dig> h reperfusion post-ischemia in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm  and nucleus  . su effectively attenuated erk phosphorylation after  <dig> h reperfusion. in addition, no changes were observed in the total protein levels of erk. these data indicate that cerebral ischemia results in an increase in erk activity which is independent of subcellular localization, but dependent on src activation in the post-ischemic hippocampus.

activated erk can facilitate the phosphorylation of a variety of transcription factors phosphorylation involved in gene expression  <cit> . two proteins regulated by erk are creb and erα, which are activated by phosphorylation at the ser <dig> residue  <cit>  and at the ser <dig> site  <cit> , respectively. in this study, creb and erα nuclear activity were observed in response to cerebral ischemia. compared with a sham group, both phospho-creb and phospho-erα are increased in the  <dig> h reperfusion groups  and similar to ischemia-induced erk activity. to determine whether src might regulate creb and erα activity following ischemia, su was employed. levels of p-erα and p-creb in the  <dig> h reperfusion group showed obvious decrease in animals in which su was administered . these data suggest that src kinase is required for activation of erk and, subsequently, erα and creb post-ischemic hippocampus.

src activation is correlated with an increase in pp2a phosphorylation and inhibition
in general, erk, erα and creb phosphorylation are determined by a balance in the activity of upstream kinases and phosphatases. it has been suggested that the ser/thr-specific phosphatase, pp2a, might negatively regulate erk, erα and creb activity  <cit> . to examine whether pp2a is involved in the regulation of the src/erk pathway post-ischemia, it was first assessed whether ischemia-induced alteration of pp2a activity. all samples were from rats subjected to various reperfusion times  after  <dig> min ischemia. tissue extracts of the hippocampi were processed and assayed using a pp2a activity assay system. the peak of pp2a activity was observed at approximately  <dig> h of reperfusion . sustained inactivation of pp2a activity was observed after  <dig> h and  <dig> h of reperfusion and was concomitant with upregulation of the erk cascade. in addition, no changes were observed in the total protein of pp2a c . to confirm inhibition of pp2a activity, immunoblot were performed to assess pp2a phosphorylation at the tyr <dig> site in the hippocampus during post-ischemic reperfusion. hippocampal tissue extracts were prepared as previously described for figure.  <dig>  as shown in figure. 2c, ischemia resulted in marked dephosphorylation of pp2a at tyr <dig> after  <dig> h reperfusion, indicating that pp2a activation was induced by ischemia. however, significant phosphorylation of pp2a at tyr <dig> was observed after  <dig> h reperfusion , indicating sustained inactivation of pp2a. active src kinase directly phosphorylates pp2a at tyr <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it was determined whether src is required for inactivation of pp2a in cerebral ischemia. induction of cerebral ischemia results in dephosphorylation of src at tyr <dig> increasing its activity at by  <dig> h reperfusion . therefore, ischemia-induced src activation is accompanied by pp2a inhibition. no changes were observed in the total protein of src and pp2a in each group . β-actin protein levels, used as a control, also remained stable in each group .

inhibition of src activity results in pp2a increased activity in response to cerebral ischemia
the results presented above suggest that activated src kinase likely regulates pp2a activity through phosphorylation at tyr <dig> following cerebral ischemia. in order to determine whether src activation is required for inactivation of pp2a in cerebral ischemia su was employed. immunoblot was performed to assess p-src and p-pp2a levels in the hippocampi of ischemic animals. rats underwent 4-vo and endured 10-min ischemia followed by  <dig> h reperfusion. as shown in figure 3a, su produced an additive increase in src phosphorylation at tyr <dig> site resulting in a decrease in src activity, since tyr <dig> is an inhibitive site of src. in contrast, su also inhibited pp2a phosphorylation at tyr <dig> after  <dig> h reperfusion . these data indicate that src activation is required for pp2a phosphorylation following ischemia. these same tissue extracts were processed and assayed using a pp2a activity assay system. as expected, the pp2a activity was higher in samples treated with su compared with the sham group . furthermore, the total protein levels of src, pp2a c and β-actin remained unchanged in each group . these data show that src activation is required for pp2a inhibition following cerebral ischemia.

inhibition of pp2a compensates for inhibition of src allowing for upregulation of erk/creb and erα in the presence of su
although activated src kinase decreases pp2a activity after cerebral ischemia, it is not known whether pp2a is involved in the src/erk cascade following cerebral ischemia. su and cantharidin , a pp2a inhibitor, was administered prior to ischemia , and erk and p-erk protein were examined in the cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of post-ischemic hippocampi. as shown in figure 4a, samples from animals treated with both ct and su had significantly higher erk phosphorylation compared with those samples treated with su only . these data demonstrate that ischemia induces src activation leading to inhibition of pp2a activity resulting in erk activation.

pp2a is also able to dephosphorylate erk targets, creb and erα. to further assess the role of pp2a in regulation of signaling cascades during cerebral ischemia, intranuclear creb and erα immunoblot assays were performed using specific phosphorylation antibodies. compared to samples treated with su only, both erα and creb phosphorylations are increased in the ct and su co-administration samples . these data suggest that src is required for up-regulation of creb and erα pathway through inhibition of pp2a activity. total protein of erk, creb and erα in each group remained unchanged .

discussion
the raf/erk pathway couples receptor tyrosine kinase  to cell fate decisions, such as growth, proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival  <cit> . it is well known that non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as src, can activate the erk cascade  <cit> . our previous studies have indicated that src kinase can up-regulate the erk cascade through direct phosphorylation of raf at tyr340/tyr <dig> in response to ischemic stroke  <cit> . here, a novel mechanism was identified whereby src kinase induces the erk pathway in a pp2a-dependent manner in rat hippocampus following ischemia .

pp2a is a ser/thr-specific phosphatase capable of dephosphorylating and inactivating erk  <cit> . induction of src results in inactivation of pp2a resulting in up-regulation of erk activity in cerebral ischemia. several lines of evidence support the role of pp2a in regulation of the src/erk pathway. first, cerebral ischemia results in sustained activation of src kinase after  <dig> h reperfusion post-ischemia, accompanied by continuous phosphorylation of tyr <dig> and inhibition of pp2a. second, su <dig>  an effective src inhibitor, prevents pp2a phosphorylation resulting in up-regulation of pp2a activity. third, cantharidin is a specific inhibitor of pp2a, which has little effect on pp <dig>  treatment with cantharidin abrogates the effects of the src inhibitor, su <dig>  allowing for upregulation of erk activity following ischemia. these results indicate that src upregulation of the erk pathway in ischemic neurons requires inhibition of pp2a.

src-induced phosphorylation and inactivation of pp2a was thought to be closely associated with intracellular calcium signaling  <cit> . in rat hippocampal neurons, the src/erk cascade is dependent on calcium influx elicited by upregulation of ion channels like nmda receptor and ip <dig> receptor. in addition, inhibition of ion channels can inhibit src and erk activity after cerebral ischemia  <cit> . our previous studies have also suggested that src kinase can up-regulate the raf/erk cascade directly in a calcium-dependent manner following ischemia stroke  <cit> . apparently, src can activate the erk cascade via coordinated activation of protein kinases and inactivation of protein phosphatases in a calcium-dependent manner.

erk exert their function through up-regulation of nuclear transcription factors resulting in changes in gene expression  <cit> . our present study indicates that there were no changes in subcellular localization of total protein levels of erk in response to ischemic stimuli. cerebral ischemia induced an increase in erk phosphorylation and activity in membrane, cytoplasma, and nucleus in hippocampal neurons. activated erk in the nucleus is sufficient to target its intranuclear substrates like creb and erα. as transcription factors, creb and erα are localized primarily in the nucleus of rat hippocampal neurons and their activities are negatively regulated by pp2a. therefore, creb and erα share similar mechanisms as downstream molecules of erk, and are modulated by src kinase through a complex signalling network dependent on pp2a inactivation. creb and erα are thought to be protective factors in the nucleus  <cit> . upregulation of intranuclear erk/creb and erα pathway is involved in neuroprotective gene expression in response to src signals following cerebral ischemia  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
activation of src kinase in neurons during cerebral ischemia induces a complex signaling network leading to activation of erk. in response to ischemia-induced upregulation of src kinase, raf, a positive regulator of the erk signaling cascade, is activated. in addition induction of src kinase activity also leads to inhibition of pp2a, a negative regulator of erk activity. activation of erk through induction of raf activity and inhibition of pp2a leads to activation of creb and erα, transcription factors, which is involved in neuronal protection from ischemic stress.
