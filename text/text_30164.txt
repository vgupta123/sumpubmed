BACKGROUND
plants have evolved sophisticated sensing systems that utilize a multitude of components to translate the perception of a pathogen into the induction of defense responses. in particular, alterations in gene expression as directed by defense-associated transcription factors  such as erf, nac, wrky, and bzip represent important host responses that occur during pathogen attack
 <cit> . in contrast, reprograming gene expression is an important strategy pathogens use to disable host defenses and enhance their ability to establish an infection. to counter the induction of these defenses pathogens have evolved mechanisms to override host transcriptional responses either through the targeted disruption of defense associated tfs or through the production of their own factors for controlling transcription
 <cit> . characterization of pathogen targeted tfs and the regulatory networks they control are thus essential to developing a full understanding of plant defense responses.

previously, we reported that the arabidopsis tf ataf <dig>  is induced in response to a tobacco mosaic virus  infection and that tmv subsequently targets ataf <dig> for degradation through an interaction with the viral  <dig> kda replication protein
 <cit>  . ataf <dig> is a member of the nac  family of plant specific tfs and is induced in response to tissue wounding and pathogen infection
 <cit> . we also observed that overexpression of ataf <dig> resulted in the induction of salicylic acid  mediated defense associated marker genes pr <dig> and pr <dig>  conversely these genes had reduced transcript levels in ataf <dig> knockout or repressor lines
 <cit> . furthermore, ataf <dig> overexpression inhibited tmv accumulation in inoculated tissues. these findings suggest that ataf <dig> plays a role in the regulation of host basal defense responses and that tmv targets ataf <dig> for degradation as a means to disrupt these defense pathways.

nac domain tfs such as ataf <dig> make up a large plant specific family of proteins with ~ <dig> nac genes in arabidopsis and ~  <dig> in rice
 <cit> . all members within this family contain a highly conserved n-terminal nac domain and a divergent c-terminal transcription activation region . nac genes have been widely reported to be involved in plant morphogenesis/organ development, senescence and abiotic/biotic stresses
 <cit> . in addition, several nac proteins are reported to interact with viral proteins. these include interactions between the nac containing grab proteins and the geminivirus repa protein
 <cit>  and the arabidopsis tip protein with the turnip crinkle virus coat protein
 <cit> . these interactions are implicated in the modulation of virus replication and the induction of host defense responses. combined these findings suggest that nac domain proteins are key tfs controlling molecular pathways that are of importance to virus biology.

to further understand the role of ataf <dig> in virus biology we utilized a genomic pull-down assay to identify potential ataf <dig> target sequences from the arabidopsis genome. an analysis of the dna sequences bound by ataf <dig> led to the identification of a 25-bp ataf <dig> specific consensus binding sequence. this binding sequence is sufficient to promote ataf <dig> mediated gene transcription and is unique in comparison to previously reported nac protein binding domains
 <cit> .

RESULTS
identification of ataf <dig> binding sequences
ataf <dig> binding sequences were identified via an immuno-pull-down assay using purified hexa-histidine tagged ataf <dig> and genomic dna isolated from arabidopsis thaliana ecotype shahdara. in addition, a hexa-histidine tagged ataf <dig> deletion construct, Δataf <dig>  lacking the putative dna binding subdomains c and d, nucleotides  <dig> –  <dig>  was used as a negative control . in this assay the hexa-histidine tagged ataf <dig> or Δataf <dig> proteins were mixed with ecori and taqi cut shahdara genomic dna and precipitated using anti-polyhis antibody
 <cit> . both ataf <dig> and Δataf <dig> bound dna fragments were subsequently pcr-amplified and cloned into a plasmid vector. the number of dna clones derived from ataf <dig> bound complexes  were 50-fold higher than that derived from Δataf <dig> bound complexes , reflecting the deletion of the putative dna binding regions. of  <dig> ataf <dig> clones randomly selected for sequencing  <dig> were located upstream and within  <dig> basepairs  of a known or predicted genomic translational start site .

the identified ataf <dig> interacting sequences were upstream and within  <dig> bp of a translation start codon. those marked by an * are upstream and within  <dig> bp of a start codon.

to confirm that ataf <dig> binds to the immunoprecipitated genomic dna fragments, a representative group of four clones covering sequences within  <dig> bp of the translational start sites for at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at3g <dig>  and at1g <dig> were selected for electrophoretic mobility shift assay  using purified recombinant hexa-histidine tagged ataf <dig>  we speculated that proximity to a translational start site would enhance the likelihood that these sequences function in ataf2-mediated gene regulation. dna fragments from the four selected clones were prepared by pcr amplification and p <dig> end-labeled. gel shift assays for all tested clones produced a mobility shift in the presence of purified ataf <dig> protein but not in the presence of purified Δataf <dig> protein .

identification of a 30-bp ataf <dig> binding sequence
one clone showing a strong mobility shift in the presence of ataf <dig>  designated c <dig>  was selected for further studies aimed at identifying the specific dna sequences targeted by ataf <dig>  the c <dig> dna clone is located upstream  of the coding region for the arabidopsis defensin-like protein at1g <dig>  to determine the likelihood that the defensin-like gene was regulated by ataf <dig> and thus a good candidate gene for further analysis, we examined its expression levels in two independent arabidopsis ecotype shahdara ataf <dig> overexpression lines as well as in response to tissue wounding 
 <cit> . quantitative rt-pcr analysis showed at1g <dig> was transcriptionally induced by an average ~4-fold in the two ataf <dig> overexpression lines as well as in wounded shahdara leaf tissues where expression of ataf <dig> is also induced . transcriptional induction of at1g <dig> thus corresponds with ataf <dig> expression, either by transgene overexpression or wound induction of the endogenous gene, consistent with a role for ataf <dig> in the regulation of this gene.

to narrow down the ataf <dig> binding sequence the c <dig> fragment was sub-divided into three segments and each fragment was examined by emsa for ataf <dig> binding . the second 300-bp fragment, f300- <dig>  showed significant binding activity while the third fragment f300- <dig> showed relatively weak binding activity and the first fragment, f300- <dig>  displayed no binding activity . none of the fragments bound to Δataf <dig> . fragments, f300- <dig> and f300- <dig> were further subdivided into four ~150-bp fragments. a 150-bp fragment, 150– <dig>  from f300- <dig>  which showed no ataf <dig> binding activity, was used as a negative control. results indicated that fragment 150– <dig>  covering nt − <dig> to − <dig> from the original 918-bp c <dig> clone was responsible for the observed ataf <dig> binding .

dnase i footprinting was used to identify the specific region of the interacting 150– <dig> c <dig> fragment protected by ataf <dig> binding. results demonstrated that only one region was substantially protected from dnase i digestion . sequence analysis of this region revealed it to be a 30-bp sequence . this protected region likely represents an ataf <dig> cis-regulatory element.

ataf <dig> 30-bp binding sequence functions in transcriptional activation
to determine if the identified 30-bp segment was sufficient to promote in vivo transcriptional activation by ataf <dig>  we first used a yeast lacz reporter system to determine if the ataf <dig> and Δataf <dig> constructs, both of which contain the putative transcriptional activation region, can function as transcriptional activators in yeast when fused to the lexa dna-binding domain . results indicated that when fused to the lexa dna binding domain both ataf <dig> and Δataf <dig> proteins function in the transcriptional activation of the lacz open reading frame . thus, given the presence of a dna specific binding domain both ataf <dig> constructs can function as transcriptional activators.

to confirm the in planta function of the identified 30-bp cis-regulatory element in ataf2-mediated gene expression, reporter constructs containing either two  or four  tandem repeats of the 30-bp sequence were engineered upstream  of the minimal 35s camv promoter and investigated for the ability to drive β-glucuronidase  transcription . the resulting gus reporter constructs were agroinfiltrated into leaves of nicotiana benthamiana in combination with 35s agro-expression constructs for ataf <dig>  Δataf <dig> or an empty cassette vector. results revealed little gus activity in plant tissues co-infiltrated with either the 2x or 4x repeat constructs and the empty cassette vector . however, when the ataf <dig> expression vector was co-infiltrated with either the 2x or 4x repeat constructs, gus activity dramatically increased . in contrast, the 35s minimal promoter construct yielded little gus activity when co-expressed with the ataf <dig> expression vector. furthermore, the co-expression of 2x or 4x repeat constructs with the Δataf <dig> construct, which lacks the putative ataf <dig> dna binding domain, also failed to induce significant gus activity . combined these results indicate that ataf <dig> can utilize the identified 30-bp regulatory binding element in vivo for transcriptional activation.

tmv infection increases gus activity driven by the 30-bp ataf <dig> binding element
previously, we demonstrated the transcriptional induction of ataf <dig> within tmv inoculated leaf tissues
 <cit> . to determine whether the identified 30-bp binding sequence functions in response to ataf <dig> produced endogenously during an infection, tmv inoculated arabidopsis leaf tissues were agro-infiltrated with either the 2x or 4x gus reporter constructs at  <dig> dpi. gus activity was quantified two days post agro-infiltration. both the levels of ataf <dig> mrna as well as gus activity increased within agro-infiltrated mock-inoculated tissues, indicating that agro-infiltration alone is sufficient to induce ataf <dig> . however, within tmv infected tissues, both 2x and 4x constructs containing the 30-bp regulatory sequence displayed significantly greater increases in gus activity  than observed in mock-inoculated tissues or tissues infiltrated with the 35s minimal promoter construct . this result corresponds with the higher levels of ataf <dig> mrna detected in the tmv infected leaves . these findings are consistent with the induction of ataf <dig> in response to tmv infection and indicates that the 30-bp binding element is a functional target of endogenously expressed ataf <dig> 

mutational analysis of the ataf <dig> binding element
to analyze the identified ataf <dig> binding element, three substitutions replacing  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides within the 30-bp binding sequence were created and tested both in vitro and in vivo . substitutions were designed to alter segments of the binding element to determine if any specific region played a greater role in ataf <dig> binding. the first mutation covers nts 3– <dig>  replacing agaag with ttttt . the second mutant covers nts 13– <dig>  substituting tcaaat to gtcccc . the third mutant covers nts 22– <dig>  exchanging aacaca to tttttt . emsa results showed that all three substitutions displayed substantial reductions of >85% in ataf <dig> binding, suggesting that the entire sequence is required for ataf <dig> binding .

ataf <dig> binding elements carrying the c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> were also introduced into the agrobacterium 2x-gus reporter construct and tested for gus activity when co-expressed with ataf <dig> in n. benthamiana leaves. in these assays, all three substitutions displayed >50% reductions in the levels of gus activity when compared to the unmodified binding element 2x-gus construct . this finding is consistent with the emsa analysis and indicates that the entire binding element is required for full activity.

to further investigate the ataf <dig> binding sequence a series of six two-base substitutions within the identified 30-bp dna fragment were created and tested for their effects on ataf <dig> binding . from gel shift assays, mutations m <dig> , m <dig> , and m <dig>  showed the most dramatic reduction in ataf <dig> binding activities of 91%, 87%, and 96%, respectively . mutation m <dig>  showed a partial reduction of 47% . the other two mutations m <dig> and m <dig> did not dramatically reduce the binding of ataf <dig> to the identified  <dig> bp element . these findings further indicate that sequences covering nearly the entire 30-bp binding domain contribute to ataf <dig> binding.

dimerization of the ataf <dig> nac domain
having demonstrated that nearly the entire 30-bp sequence is required for optimal ataf <dig> binding, we speculated that ataf <dig> may function as a dimer or multimer, similar to other reported nac domain proteins
 <cit> . to characterize the quaternary structure of ataf <dig>  the ataf <dig> dna-binding domain  was expressed from bacteria and the purified protein examined using size-exclusion chromatography. results indicate that the purified ataf <dig> nac domain peptide eluted as a protein of around ~ <dig> kda, which is twice the molecular weight of the monomeric nac domain  , indicating that the dna binding domain of ataf <dig> forms a dimer.

ataf2-mediated regulation of selected pull-down sequences
to examine the ability of ataf <dig> to alter the transcription of genes identified in the pull down assay, a group of nine genes were selected and examined by real-time qrt-pcr for expression in both wounded wild-type and wounded ataf <dig> knockout  line  leaf tissues. wounding was used to induce endogenous ataf <dig> expression with tissues harvested after  <dig> hours
 <cit> . genes were selected based on the location of an ataf <dig> binding sequence within  <dig> bp of a translational start codon. in addition, defensin-like protein at1g <dig>  corresponding to clone c <dig>  was included in the group as a control. consistent with our previous results the transcript of at1g <dig> showed a reduced accumulation in wounded tissues from the ataf <dig> ko line . furthermore,  <dig> of the  <dig> additional transcripts examined showed at least a two-fold reduction in accumulation within wounded tissues of the ataf <dig> ko line . these findings indicate that a significant portion of the genes whose promoter sequences were pulled-downed by ataf <dig> are directly affected by its presence and are thus likely to carry a functional ataf <dig> binding sequence.

* qrt-pcr analysis of ataf <dig> and selected candidate ataf <dig> target genes at  <dig> hrs post leaf wounding vs non-wounded tissues. fold changes are the average of two independent experiments. for each experiment leaf rna was pooled from  <dig> individual test plants and qrt-pcr reactions were run in duplicate and normalized to  <dig> s rrna levels.

wild-type columbia and ataf <dig> knock-out  plants were mechanically wounded  <dig> hr prior to rna extraction.

identification of an ataf <dig> consensus binding sequence
to expand upon the characterization of the ataf <dig> binding sequence, pull-down sequences that were within  <dig> bp of a translational start site and showed ataf <dig> binding via emsa and / or displayed altered transcript accumulations in ataf <dig> ko plants were selected for motif analysis using the program meme
 <cit> . this selection criteria yielded eight different pull-down clones for which there was secondary evidence supporting ataf <dig> binding. meme analysis of these pull-down sequences revealed a consensus 25-nt sequence that corresponded to the 30-bp sequence identified above from the original c <dig> clone . the consensus sequence is predominantly a/t rich, but does contain repeating aaa motifs in forward or reverse orientations. subsequently we expanded our analysis to  <dig> of the original clones identified by pull-down assay that were upstream and within  <dig> bp of a known or predicted translational start site. meme analysis of these genes also identified a similar a/t rich sequence within each of the additional clones .

discussion
the induction of basal resistance responses can significantly impact virus accumulation and spread even within a susceptible host
 <cit> . thus, methods aimed at enhancing basal resistance could provide novel approaches for creating new forms of disease resistance. a number of studies indicate that sa mediates several anti-viral pathways that contribute to host basal defenses
 <cit> . recent studies by lee et al.,
 <cit>  suggest that during tmv infections sa-mediated signaling controls resistance mechanisms that involve the alternative oxidase pathway, rdr <dig> mediated rna silencing systems, and other as yet uncharacterized defenses. these findings indicate that anti-viral defenses require the regulation of multiple host processes. subsequently, viruses likely encode multiple countermeasures aimed at overcoming these defenses. the targeted degradation of ataf <dig> by tmv suggests that this tf regulates host processes that affect the infection cycle. this possibility is supported by studies that show overexpression of ataf <dig> leads to the induction of defense related genes and enhanced plant resistance to tmv
 <cit> . in contrast, t-dna knockout or transcription repressor plant lines show a marked decrease in the activation of these defense-associated genes. in particular, sa associated defense genes including pr <dig> and pr <dig> are reduced in transcriptional activation in the absence of ataf <dig>  either by knockout, transcriptional repression or tmv directed degradation
 <cit> . these findings indicate that ataf <dig> functions to enhance host basal defense processes and that its targeted degradation represents a potential tmv-directed counterdefense mechanism.

to better understand the ability of ataf <dig> to regulate host gene expression we sought to characterize ataf2’s function in the transcriptional regulation of cellular processes. the highly divergent c-terminal tar regions of nac proteins are thought to confer transcriptional activation of specific cellular functions including developmental and defense signaling pathways
 <cit> . in yeast, the c-terminal tar region of ataf <dig> functioned to induce lacz gene expression , confirming ataf2’s role as a transcriptional activator. subsequently, a hexa-histidine-tagged ataf <dig> protein readily functioned to pull-down arabidopsis genomic dna derived from the promoter regions of diverse genes. a representative sequence located within  <dig> bp of the translational start site for the defensin-like protein at1g <dig> was subsequently used to identify a 30-bp sequence that functioned as a cis-regulatory binding sequence for ataf <dig>  most notably when co-expressed in planta with ataf <dig> this 30-bp sequence directed the expression of a gus reporter construct . this 30-bp sequence also directed in planta gus expression in response to a tmv infection . thus, the induction of endogenous ataf <dig> in response to infection is sufficient to drive gene expression from the identified ataf <dig> binding sequence. tissue wounding is also known to induce the transcription of ataf2
 <cit> . subsequent analysis of the transcript levels from nine of the original ataf <dig> pull-down clones showed that eight were transcriptionally reduced by at least  <dig> fold in wounded tissues of the ataf <dig> ko line in comparison to wounded tissues of the wild-type plant line . the reduced transcriptional activation of these genes in the absence of ataf <dig> indicates that ataf <dig> contributes to the transcriptional regulation of these genes, further confirming the importance of the identified ataf <dig> binding sequence within the promoters of these genes.

wound induced activation of genes identified in the original ataf <dig> pull-down assay indicated that these genes contain ataf <dig> specific binding sequences. motif analysis searches using the identified 30-bp binding sequence and promoter sequences shown to regulate gene expression upon the induction of ataf <dig> or bind ataf <dig> directly showed the presence of a 25-bp consensus sequence that was subsequently found in all analyzed pull-down sequences . the identified 25-bp sequence is a/t rich and contains repeats of a aaa motif either consecutively or in reverse orientation. previous studies have identified several nac family dna binding elements. in one study, in vitro selection was used to identify the dna binding site of two functionally diverse nac proteins: anac <dig>  implicated in stress, and anac <dig>  implicated in morphogenesis
 <cit> . a core binding element of cgt was identified. this sequence is the reverse complement of the core binding sequence identified from three nac proteins  that recognizes a 63-bp sequence harboring cacg as the core dna binding site
 <cit> . combined these findings suggest that diverse nac proteins can bind similar sequences. however, other nac proteins appear to bind different sequences. for example, nac <dig> binds to a 21-bp dna fragment containing an as- <dig> element 
 <cit> . in wheat, a nac protein binding consensus sequence was identified as gnncgtnnnnnacgta
 <cit> . these previously identified nac binding sequences including their core binding motifs are not present within the identified ataf <dig> binding sequence, suggesting that ataf <dig> recognizes a binding sequence different from that used by other nac proteins. the a/t rich nature of the ataf <dig> binding domain does have similarities to other plant based transcription binding domains. for example, the regulatory region of the pea plastoxyanin gene promoter is similarly a/t rich and is recognized by proteins containing high mobility group box domains that presumably modulate gene expression
 <cit> . this diversity in sequence recognition reflects the large family of nac proteins and the wide range of functions assigned to this tf family.

the  <dig> bp length of the dna nuclease protected fragment and its nearly complete requirement for activity as determined by mutagenesis studies  suggested ataf <dig> functions as a multimer. this is consistent with previous studies that have shown several nac proteins form and function as dimers
 <cit> . in addition, crystallographic data for anac <dig> reveals an antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices with a defined dimer interface that promotes both homo- and hetero-interactions along with a positively charged face that is thought to promote dna binding
 <cit> . to confirm the oligomeric status of ataf <dig>  purified ataf <dig> nac domain was examined through a size exclusion chromatography and a peak representing a dimeric form of the nac domain was observed . oligomerization of bacterial purified ataf <dig> nac domain suggests that ataf <dig> likely functions as a dimer. whether the functional ataf <dig> oligomer is a homodimer or heterodimer formed with another nac protein is unknown, but it is clear that the induction of ataf <dig> in response to wounding or stress is required for the transcriptional activation of gene promoters encoding the identified binding sequence.

the role of ataf <dig> in basal defense is not as yet resolved. however, it is interesting to note that several of the ataf <dig> target genes identified in this study have links to defense responses. for example, polyamine oxidase  <dig> protein  displays significant transcript reductions within ataf <dig> ko tissues, indicating it is positively regulated by ataf <dig> . furthermore, polyamines are known to accumulate in response to a number of environmental stresses including pathogen attack
 <cit> . pao <dig> functions within the peroxiosome, catalyzing accumulated polyamines and producing h2o <dig> <cit> . uehara et al.
 <cit>  proposed the production of h2o <dig> from the catalysis of polyamines functions as a signal transducer for the activation of defense responses. another example is the oxidative stress  <dig> protein , which is also positively regulated by ataf <dig>  oxs <dig> is required for resistance to cadmium and co-localizes to the nucleus with the nucleosomal histone protein h <dig> where it is thought to function as a remodeling factor, moving the location of the nucleosome and altering gene expression
 <cit> . interestingly, cadmium treatment is linked to tmv resistance in plants and is correlated with the deposition of callose within the plasmodesmata and vascular tissues
 <cit> . ueki and citovsky
 <cit>  identified a cadmium induced glycine-rich protein  that localizes to the vascular cell walls and promotes callose deposition. overexpression of cdigrp enhanced tmv resistance while its knockdown results in increased virus spread. in both of the above examples, ataf <dig> directed regulation of pao <dig> and oxs <dig> could enhance virus resistance via the production of h2o <dig> and the induction of cdigrp, respectively. such defense responses indicate that tmv’s targeted degradation of ataf <dig> functions as an anti-defense countermeasure. however, confirming the role of ataf <dig> in regulating these resistance pathways and their effect on mediating defense against tmv requires additional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the identification of the ataf <dig> binding sequence and its function in gene regulation in response to wounding and tmv infection. identification of this binding sequence represents a significant step toward identifying the basal defense processes associated with ataf <dig> expression as well as understanding the tmv counterdefenses targeting these processes.
