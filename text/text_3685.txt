BACKGROUND
the mammalian protein kinase c family embraces ten serine/threonine kinase isoforms divided into three subfamilies: classical pkcs , novel pkcs , and atypical pkcs . like all npkcs, pkcϵ does not depend on calcium but on diacylglycerol to become active, since its c <dig> domain-like sequence lacks residues with calcium-coordinating side chains  <cit> . regarding pkcϵ regulation, phosphorylation of the pkcϵ catalytic domain is required so that pkcϵ can reach full enzymatic activity  <cit> , whereas phosphorylation of one of the serine residues of its regulatory domain enables the interaction of pkcϵ with 14-3- <dig> proteins  <cit> . in addition to the regulatory domains of the pkc family, pkcϵ also contains an exclusive motif that binds actin and allows for its phosphorylation  <cit> . therefore, actin, as well as other proteins, such as histone <dig>  <cit>  or tram  <cit> , can interact and serve as pkcϵ substrates. in addition, phosphorylation by pkcϵ of molecules such as akt  <cit>  or pkd  <cit>  make evident the significant role of this npkc isoform in the regulation of cell signaling. pkcϵ also regulates ion channels, such as gabaa receptors  <cit> , or cytoskeleton proteins, as for example vimentin  <cit>  and actin as above mentioned  <cit> . pkcϵ is also involved in different cellular events, as for example cell migration  <cit>  and cell division  <cit> . although pkcϵ deficient mice are viable  <cit> , they display several phenotypes, such as impaired cutaneous wound closure  <cit> , improved glucose-induced insulin secretion and reduction of insulin clearance  <cit> , and glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis  <cit> . in addition, pkcϵ has been suggested as a promoter of different types of cancer  <cit> . hence, pkcϵ also appears important in pathological scenarios. however, the overall expression pattern of this isoform has not been reported yet. in this study, we show the spatiotemporal expression of pkcϵ in mouse during embryogenesis by using pkcϵ null embryos containing the lacz reporter gene under the control of the endogenous pkcϵ promoter  <cit> , and by staining wild type embryos with antibodies to pkcϵ. thus, these data contribute to the general understanding of the expression of murine pkcϵ in vivo, and to ellucidate exclusive or redundant roles of pkcϵ.

RESULTS
pkcϵ expression at e <dig>  and e <dig> 
pkcϵ analysis through lacz staining was performed from e <dig>  to e <dig> . given the absence of obvious developmental phenotypes, homozygous embryos were chosen to report lacz stained domains due to their increased signal, mainly at earlier stages, versus their heterozygous littermates. in addition, antibody staining with corresponding negative controls was performed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  as a control for the specifity of the lacz signal. moreover, to confirm the absence of endogenous β-galactosidase activity in our stainings, wild type littermates underwent the same lacz staining protocol . background problems using in situ hybridization prevented us from obtaining reliable signal, and therefore data obtained with this technique were not included here. however, there is a recent in situ hybridization study of the mouse transcriptome at e <dig>  that shows mrna expression of pkcϵ at domains that we also report here  <cit> , which further strengthens our data.

at e <dig> , lac z activity was mainly detected at the primitive heart, along with some weak signal in the yolk sac . lacz signal was noticeably increased at e <dig>  in the developing heart , and weak novel staining was detected at somites and rathke’s pouch . consistently, immunostaining of wt whole embryos and sections of the embryonic stage showed similar staining pattern, with heart, somites and rathke’s pouch as the domains showing immunoreactivity . pkcϵ deficient embryo sections were used as a negative control . a closer look at the heart on immunostained sections allowed us to observe pkcϵ expression mainly at the walls of the primitive ventricle , atrium  and truncus arteriosus  . immunodetection of pkcϵ at this stage could be detected at most cells in somites  and rathke’s pouch . the absence of signal in pkcϵ deficient sections and the overlapping pattern obtained through both staining methods confirmed the specifity of the signal at the reported domains through both approaches.

pkcϵ expression from e <dig>  to e <dig> 
in e <dig>  whole mount embryos, the nervous system became noticeable through β-galactosidase staining. thus, neural tube in caudal region of tail, dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal  neural crest, facio-acoustic  neural crest complex all showed lac z signal, along with cephalic mesenchyme tissue and roof of the hindbrain . x-gal staining was still strong in the heart at this stage and onwards.

at e <dig> , dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal  ganglion was strongly stained. moreover, fascio-acustic  ganglion complex, and interior ganglion of vagus  nerve all showed prominent lacz reporter gene expression . the strong lacz signal observed in heart and ganglia at this stage and onwards suggests an important role of pkcϵ within the vascular and nervous systems. however, the lack of obvious developmental defects suggests the existence of functional redundancy with other pkc isoforms. pkcδ might be a candidate in this regard given its similar expression pattern  <cit> .

at e <dig> , whole mount lacz staining still showed clear signal in the neural and cardiovascular systems , but in addition signal at the caudal part of medula oblongata  and kidney  could be observed. in addition, although lacz signal in blood vessels was first weakly detected from e <dig> , it was from e <dig>  when pkcϵ expression in this domain was very obvious . however, pkcϵ in blood vessels could not be detected via immunostaining even at later stages, when the lacz activity in endothelium was even clearer. since pkcϵ appears expressed in vitro in mouse embryonic endothelial cells  as well as in endothelial cells from other species  <cit> , we speculate that endothelial pkcϵ expression in vivo is too low to be detected in mouse by the antibody and/or protocol we used in our immunohistochemistry. hence, detection of pkcϵ expression in endothelium via lacz staining was perhaps possible because the neo cassette that was used to generate pkcϵ deficient mice  <cit>  upregulated pkcϵ expression in endothelium, as previously shown for other genes and tissues  <cit> .

pkcϵ expression at e <dig>  and e <dig> 
in addition to blood vessels, ganglia, and other lacz-stained domains described at previous stages, reporter activity at e <dig>  was detected in the pinna of the ear, chroroid plexus and ventral part of medulla oblongata . a closer look on e <dig>  lacz-stained sections showed that only some and not all cells in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia were responsible for the strong x-gal staining observed on these domains . this might be due to penetration related issues of x-gal, which would have prevented the staining of the whole domain. β-galactosidase activity was also observed in urogenital sinus, dorsal part of the jaw, heart, mucosal lining of the stomach and limbs . the signal detected at the heart was located at the trabeculated part of the wall of the ventricles . immunostaining of sagittal and cross sections at e <dig>  could confirm pkcϵ expression at domains previously reported via lacz staining as well as other new domains that were not detected through lacz activity. however, such domains were not stained in pkcϵ deficient mouse sections  and therefore appear specific. ganglia was the most prominently immunostained domain, as observed via lacz. thus, antibodies allowed for detection of pkcϵ at dorsal root ganglia , hypothalamus, trigeminus and cerebral cortex , neural tube , urogenital sinus , kidney and mucosal lining of the stomach , heart  and limbs .

as expected, and consistent with previous mrna analysis of embryos at e <dig>   <cit> , pkcϵ was still detected at domains such as root ganglia or brain . however, at this stage x-gal staining was also observed on yet unreported domains at the mrna level, such as blood vessels , snout –except for whiskers , umbilical chord , and precartilage primordium of bone, mainly at forelimbs and hindlimbs. thus, radius, precartilage primordium of phalangeal, metacarpal and carpal bone were showing remarkable lacz activity .

CONCLUSIONS
our expression pattern for pkcϵ during mouse midgestation suggests that at least several domains, such as ganglia, vascular system, cartilage primordium or stomach, express this novel pkc isoform. however, heart and nervous system appear as the main sites of expression for pkcϵ. more specifically, dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal  ganglia are the domains where pkcϵ seems to be most prominently expressed. thus, as already indicated by mouse ex vivo studies  <cit>  and in vivo work performed in rats  <cit> , these data suggest that pkcϵ likely has an important in vivo role within the nervous system in mice. the fact that there is no reported phenotype or functional deficiency in the nervous system in mice suggests the existence of functional redundancy among members of the pkc family. indeed, data regarding transcription of pkc δ  <cit>  and ϵ  <cit>  within the same domains of the nervous system already exist as part of a study that uses an in situ hybridization approach to show the expression pattern of a high number of transcripts in the mouse embryo  <cit> . in addition, our recent description of the expression pattern for pkc δ at the protein level during mouse midgestation  <cit>  together with the present study also show the co-existence of these two npkc isorforms within the vascular and nervous systems. thus, the expression pattern of pkcϵ may contribute to address such redundancy by pointing us towards domain causing potential lethality in mice lacking several pkc isoforms.
