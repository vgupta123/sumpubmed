BACKGROUND
the powdery mildew disease, caused by obligate biotrophic ascomycete fungi of the order erysiphales, is a major impediment for cereal  agriculture in temperate climates. in barley , polygenic resistance, dominantly inherited resistance  genes or recessively inherited mutants of the mildew resistance locus o  confer protection against the fungal disease  <cit> . while r genes usually provide isolate-specific resistance that is of little constancy under field conditions, mlo resistance is broad-spectrum and durable  <cit> . mutants at the mlo locus, which can be obtained by mutagenesis of any susceptible wild type line, were first described in the 1940s  <cit> . besides a broad collection of induced mlo mutants  <cit>  one natural mlo allele has been reported to date. this allele  originates from an ethiopian landrace and represents the major source of mlo resistance introgressed into cultivated european spring barleys  <cit> . the mlo gene encodes the founder of a family of plant-specific integral membrane proteins with heptahelical topology and yet unknown biochemical activity  <cit> . mlo genes are organized in small- to medium-sized families per higher plant species  <cit> . powdery mildew resistance conferred by loss-of-function alleles of the mlo locus have for a long time thought to represent a unique feature of the monocot barley. recently, however, mlo resistance was also discovered in the dicot species arabidopsis thaliana and solanum lycopersicum , either caused by induced mutant alleles or as a consequence of a naturally occurring deletion in the coding region, respectively  <cit> .

previous molecular analyses of induced barley mlo mutants in combination with site-directed mutagenesis and bioinformatic analysis based on multiple sequence alignments provided a first glimpse on the amino acids of the heptahelical barley mlo protein that are decisive for its susceptibility-conferring function  <cit> . amongst these residues are four extracellularly located cysteines that are thought to form two disulfide bridges as well as few amino acids located in various regions of the polytopic membrane protein. these studies also revealed that some mutation-induced single amino acid substitutions lead to aberrant mlo variants that each serves as a substrate for an endoplasmic reticulum -associated quality control system. this cellular quality control system, also known as erad , is conserved among eukaryotes and recognizes malformed protein variants in the er. these are then retranslocated to the cytoplasm, poly-ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . three distinct erad pathways can be defined on the basis of the different ubiquitin ligase complexes involved in substrate elimination: the erad-l pathway mediates removal of soluble  er substrates whilst depending on the presence of either misfolded transmembrane or cytosolic domains, membrane-anchored substrates are removed by either the erad-m or erad-c pathway  <cit> .

here, we studied at the molecular level a set of hitherto uncharacterized natural and induced mlo mutant alleles to identify novel sites of functional relevance in the mlo protein. we complemented this approach by site-directed mutagenesis based on alanine scan in a defined region of the mlo protein. our results reveal a crucial role for the second and third cytoplasmic loop in powdery mildew-associated mlo function, while only lesions in the second cytoplasmic loop appear to be recognized by the cellular erad machinery.

RESULTS
identification of a putative novel natural mlo allele in an ethiopian barley landrace accession
we previously identified the mlo- <dig> allele as a sporadic mutant in two-rowed awnless ethiopian barley landraces that at the molecular level is characterized by the presence of a unique repeat structure  <cit> . to screen for further natural mlo alleles distinct from mlo- <dig>  we examined additional powdery mildew resistant barley germplasm of different geographical origin by gel blot analysis for presence of the characteristic mlo- <dig> genomic tandem repeat structure. one source was ethiopian barley landrace material from the dutch centre for genetic resources in wageningen http://www.cgn.wur.nl/uk/. while seven of the eight tested accessions obtained from this site showed the hybridization pattern that is typical for the mlo- <dig> allele , one accession  lacked this signal, suggesting that this line does not harbor the common natural mlo- <dig> allele. microscopic evaluation revealed that the bgh entry rate in this accession was ca. 30% , considerably below the 50-80% penetration success that is typical for bgh on susceptible wild type  barley lines, but clearly distinct from the near complete penetration resistance seen in mlo null alleles. we reasoned that this landrace either expresses a type of powdery mildew resistance that is different from mlo-conditioned resistance, or that it may contain a weak natural mlo allele with residual susceptibility-conferring activity. to differentiate between these two possibilities, we extracted rna from accession cgn <dig> and performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  to amplify and sequence the mlo cdna sequence of this line. compared to the reference sequence  we determined a g to c  exchange in the mlo coding sequence resulting in a valine to leucine  substitution at the amino acid level. the predicted amino acid exchange is located in the second transmembrane domain of the heptahelical mlo protein. the respective polymorphism is neither present in the mlo sequence of a selection of european barley cultivars nor in the mlo sequence of  <dig> analyzed barley hordeum spontaneum accessions of broad haplotype diversity  <cit>  and may therefore represent a novel natural mlo allele.

to further assess this hypothesis we used the previously described transient gene expression assay in single barley leaf epidermal cells  <cit>  to analyze a potential complementation  of the partial penetration resistance in this accession upon overexpression of a wild type mlo cdna. this experiment resulted in the reinstatement of a bgh entry rate that is typical for the complementation of mlo resistance in this assay . we thus conclude that the accession cgn <dig> likely harbors a novel natural mlo allele that results in partial loss of mlo function. mutagen-induced weak mlo alleles with residual function have been previously reported  and mlo <dig> ;  <cit> ) however, the mlo-typical recessive inheritance and allelism with known mlo mutants need to be formally proven by future test crosses of the accession with barley mlo and mlo genotypes.

two landrace accessions from yemen harbor the mlo- <dig> allele
next we analyzed powdery mildew infection types of two barley landrace accessions  collected in yemen. based on an inoculation survey with a broad range of powdery mildew isolates , these two accessions, which originate from the al bayda' province of yemen, were suspected to harbor a mlo allele. indeed, first leaves of selfed progeny of these two lines  showed no visible signs of infection except for an occasional infection type  <dig> , resulting in few mildew colonies. these colonies were about half the size compared to colonies on the susceptible barley cultivar manchurian. such a reaction has been previously designated as 0/ and is characteristic of mlo resistance  <cit> .

we first tested the possibility that the yemenite accessions harbor the well-characterized mlo- <dig> allele. pcr analysis using genomic dna and two specific primer pairs  associated with the terminal repeat in the majority of mlo- <dig> genotypes) revealed that both 5589-1- <dig> and 5590-1- <dig> harbor the mlo-11-typical repeat units . we conclude that the two accessions collected in yemen represent mlo- <dig> alleles, which were originally reported to come from ethiopia  <cit> .

an accession from turkey harbors the mlo- <dig> allele
among  <dig> accessions of barley landraces collected before  <dig> in turkey that were screened for resistance to powdery mildew, four lines derived from landrace rah <dig>  showed resistance to a set of  <dig> tested bgh isolates. resistance of these lines was thus suspected to be based on a mutation at the mlo locus  <cit> . pcr analysis of genomic dna from line rah <dig> indicated that this accession does not harbor the natural mlo- <dig> allele . we extracted total rna from first leaves of the respective mutant plant and used it as template for rt-pcr-based amplification of the mlo coding sequence. the amplified mlo cdna sequence was subjected to sequence analysis and found to harbor a t to a nucleotide substitution, predicted to result in a change of tryptophan  <dig> to arginine  at the protein level. this sequence polymorphism is identical to the mlo- <dig> mutant allele, which was originally induced in cultivar haisa by x-ray mutagenesis  <cit> . the black seed coat of accession rah <dig> indicates, however, that this line is distinct from the european cultivars known to harbor the mlo- <dig> allele, which are typically characterized by light seed coats. to resolve whether line rah <dig> harbors an independent and possibly natural version of the mlo- <dig> mutant allele we performed molecular fingerprint analysis at the mlo locus. we employed previously described simple sequence repeat  markers that are located few kb upstream of the mlo gene and that were found suitable, owing to their highly polymorphic character, to display the haplotype diversity of cultivated and wild barleys  <cit> . pcr amplification and subsequent dna sequence analysis revealed that the respective haplotype of accession rah <dig> is identical to that of the original mlo- <dig> mutant in cultivar haisa as well to a mlo-1-containing backcross line  in cultivar ingrid . taken together, these results suggest that the original radiation-induced mlo- <dig> allele is present in accession rah <dig>  likely because of its deliberate or accidental introgression into a barley line/variety from the middle east that has a dark seed coat.

molecular characterization of novel induced mlo alleles
given the limited success to identify new natural mlo alleles we focused in the following on induced mlo alleles. we previously reported the molecular characterization of a range of mlo mutant alleles that were either induced by radiation or chemical mutagenesis  <cit> . to extend the collection of informative mutant sites we analyzed the mlo coding sequence of a further range of induced mlo candidate alleles reported in the literature  <cit> . the respective mutant plants were previously found to exhibit the mlo characteristic 0/ infection phenotype, suggesting that they are affected at the mlo locus. moreover, for two of the mutant plants  an allelic relationship with other mlo mutants has been shown  <cit> .

we extracted total rna from first leaves of the respective powdery mildew resistant mutant plants and used it as template for rt-pcr-based amplification of the mlo coding sequence. amplified mlo cdna sequences were subjected to sequence analysis. in most cases we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms that either lead to a single amino acid substitution or a premature stop codon . two mutants  revealed evidence for aberrant mlo transcript splicing, owing either to the presence of multiple aberrant transcript versions  or the presence of one aberrant transcript type harboring the entire mlo intron  <dig> .

in case of mlo- <dig>  pooled cdnas were cloned into vector pcr-bluntii-topo and seven individual recombinant clones subjected to sequence analysis. this revealed a g to a mutation in the ag consensus 3' splice site of intron  <dig>  resulting in four distinct versions of the mlo cdna, including a wild-type-like cdna and three incorrectly spliced variants . all anomalous splicing variants give rise to frame shifts and premature stop codons. occurrence of a low level of correctly spliced cdnas in the mlo- <dig> mutant indicates that the defective 3' consensus splice site is still being used, though seemingly with a lower efficiency. in case of mlo- <dig>  a g to a mutation in the gt consensus 5' splice site sequence of intron  <dig> results in a complete lack of splicing of this intron. consequently, the respective cdna harbors the entire intron  <dig> sequence, leading to an aberrant coding sequence and a premature stop codon .

overall, we characterized  <dig> novel mlo alleles , of which two harbor mutations in splice junctions , while four result in a premature stop codon  and seven give rise to single amino acid substitutions in various regions of the mlo protein , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , and - <dig> ; additional file 1). interestingly, one amino acid substitution  was found twice, in lines sr <dig>  and sr <dig> . though it is a possibility that the same mutation was induced twice independently, it is more likely that a mix-up in seed materials resulted in duplication of the same mutant allele. lack of dna sequence polymorphisms in the mlo cdnas of cultivars bonus and kristina prevents discrimination of these two scenarios. interestingly, the same amino acid residue  is affected in the previously described fully independent mlo- <dig> allele in the genetic background of cultivar plena; however, in the latter mutant the glycine residue is replaced by glutamic acid .

site-directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues in the second and third cytoplasmic loop of the mlo protein
given the high prevalence of amino acid substitutions in the second and third cytoplasmic loop of the mlo protein that result in non-functional mlo protein variants we wondered whether conserved amino acid residues in these regions might be generally critical for the susceptibility-conferring activity. to address this question further we performed systematic site-directed mutagenesis in a defined portion of the third cytoplasmic loop. we selected a region located between the mutant sites of mlo- <dig>  and mlo- <dig>  and focused on amino acid residues in this part of the protein that are conserved with respect to their biochemical characteristics between the barley mlo and arabidopsis thaliana atmlo <dig> co-orthologs  <cit>  but distinct from the small aliphatic amino acids glycine, alanine and valine . nucleotide sequences in this stretch of the mlo coding sequence were modified by pcr to encode alanine instead of the respective authentic amino acid . this resulted in a set of twelve site-directed mlo mutants. additionally, we generated barley mlo cdna analogs of three mutants originally discovered in atmlo <dig>  <cit> . these comprise mutants atmlo2- <dig>  atmlo2- <dig> and atmlo2- <dig>  which are each characterized by a single amino acid substitution in the atmlo <dig> coding region and affect the second cytoplasmic loop of the atmlo <dig> protein . we identified the corresponding residues in the barley mlo protein by comparative amino acid sequence alignment  and created the respective mutant versions  by site-directed pcr mutagenesis . together with the twelve mutant variants of the third cytoplasmic loop, this resulted in a set of  <dig> novel single amino acid substitution variants for functional analysis of the mlo protein.

we tested the fifteen mutant variants for their capacity to complement the mlo resistance phenotype in transient gene expression experiments  <cit>  and additionally determined their in planta protein accumulation based on dual luciferase reporter assays, which were previously shown to faithfully reflect in vivo levels of mlo mutant variants  <cit> . the latter analysis revealed that the accumulation of most mutant protein variants did not differ considerably from wild type mlo . exceptions comprised mutant variants d219n, q310a, d311a and r312a, which showed a statistically significant partial reduction in mlo levels . whereas the tested variants largely retained wild-type like protein levels, most conferred a notable reduction in powdery mildew host cell entry. these included the three mutant variants s187f, d219n and d251n, which phenocopied the respective mutations in atmlo <dig> with respect to powdery mildew resistance, as well as a range of mutant variants towards the end of the third cytoplasmic loop . of note in this respect is the f329a mutant that not even partially complemented the mlo resistance phenotype. remarkably, lack of complementation was predominantly seen in mutant variants that showed unaltered  protein accumulation . this excludes the possibility that lower mlo protein levels account for the reduced functionality of these variants. single amino acid substitution variants that showed impaired complementation efficiency, despite overexpression in the transient gene expression assay, denote amino acid residues that are crucial for mlo function in the context of powdery mildew susceptibility.

discussion
in this study we molecularly characterized a variety of novel natural and induced mlo mutant candidates. this revealed one new natural candidate mlo allele as well as  <dig> chemically and radiation induced mlo alleles, comprising nine single amino acid substitutions that result in loss-of-mlo function in the context of barley-powdery mildew interactions . taken together, these protein sites can be integrated into a map of amino acid residues that are crucial for the powdery mildew susceptibility-conferring function of the mlo protein . intriguingly, most amino acids in this map cluster in the cytoplasmic regions of the protein, in particular in cytoplasmic loops  <dig> and  <dig>  although this picture is somewhat skewed by the fact that a range of single amino acid substitutions in the third cytoplasmic loop were selected in a targeted manner, it is noteworthy that all barley mutant alleles that result in stable mlo protein variants , mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig>  and mlo- <dig> ) are affected in amino acids that are located in cytoplasmic regions of the mlo protein. since information about the in planta protein accumulation of mlo variants encoded by mutant alleles mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig>  and mlo- <dig>  is lacking to date, this figure might be even higher. moreover, the three single amino substitution variants that were engineered in the barley mlo protein based on the data of powdery mildew resistant arabidopsis atmlo <dig> mutant alleles  also localize to a cytoplasmic loop. it is noteworthy that with the exception of site-directed mutants in cysteine residues  <cit>  no barley mlo mutant was identified that codes for a mutation in an extracellularly localized amino acid. it thus appears that the cytoplasmic regions are of particular importance for mlo function in the context of powdery mildew susceptibility. cytoplasmic loop-loop interplay was previously suggested to be crucial for mlo activity  <cit> , and mutations in the cytoplasmic regions may interfere with these inter- or intramolecular domain interactions. genetic analyses in arabidopsis indeed suggest the possible formation of homo- or hetero-oligomeric mlo complexes  <cit> . alternatively, mutations in the cytoplasmic loops may abrogate interactions with other, yet unidentified, protein partners or impede the yet unknown biochemical activity of the mlo protein. it remains to be shown whether mutant sites identified in the context of powdery mildew resistance also compromise the authentic mlo function. allele-specific correlation of the degree of powdery mildew resistance with the extent of early leaf senescence  <cit> , a pleiotropic effect of mlo mutants that is thought to reflect a genuine mlo activity  <cit> , suggests that the protein domains that are crucial for both functions at least largely overlap.

a set of characterized mlo mutants encode protein variants that show reduced mlo accumulation . it was previously shown that these aberrant polypeptides are substrates of an er-localized quality control system that monitors the integrity of membrane-localized proteins. this so-called erad machinery is conserved among eukaryotes and ensures that only properly folded proteins reach their final cellular destination. in the case of integral membrane proteins, the removal process of defective protein variants typically involves retrotranslocation from the er membrane into the cytosol, polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome. however, it is currently largely unknown which signatures classify malformed membrane proteins as clients of the erad machinery  <cit> . it has been suggested that cytoplasmic chaperones assist maintaining solubility of large cytoplasmic loops in erad-c substrates  <cit> . in this context it is remarkable that five out of seven tested mlo mutant variants with amino acid substitutions in the large second cytoplasmic loop are erad substrates , mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig>  and mlo d219n), while the nine tested mutant variants of the small third cytoplasmic loop , mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig> , mlo p320a, p324a, f329a, w <dig>  f331a, r33a) are all stable in planta. we hypothesize that the larger second cytoplasmic loop is a major quality determinant of the mlo protein, while mutations in the smaller third cytoplasmic loop appear to escape the erad machinery. this effect could be related to the size difference and/or the topology of the two cytoplasmic regions, which may result in a more prominent exposure of amino acid residues from the bulky second loop. based on consensus secondary structure prediction of the second and third cytoplasmic loop  we noted that mutations resulting in unstable protein variants predominantly reside in regions that are predicted to adopt an α-helical structure. in contrast, mutations that escape the erad system are mostly located in regions that are predicted to adopt β-sheet or a random coil secondary structure. thus, in addition to the differential recognition of the second and third cytoplasmic loop by their size, the secondary  structure of a given region might be the common denominator that determines detection by the erad quality control system.

besides the second cytoplasmic loop, the transmembrane regions also seem to be sites that are particularly sensitive to mutational perturbations that result in reduced mlo accumulation. this appears plausible since, in the case of integral membrane proteins, the delay or failure of mutant variants to co-translationally integrate into the er lipid bilayer is known to lead to recognition by components of the erad-m pathway, relocation from the er membrane and subsequent protein degradation. it is assumed that misfolded transmembrane domains expose hydrophobic amino acid side chains to the lipid bilayer, which are sensed by the transmembrane domain of the erad component hrd1p, an er-localized integral membrane protein with a c-terminal ring domain and e <dig> ubiquitin ligase function  <cit> . notably, although they bare lesions in the cytoplasmic regions, the tested barley mlo variants encoded by mutant alleles mlo- <dig> , mlo- <dig>  and mlo- <dig>  require hrd1p for erad-based degradation in yeast  <cit> .

in the context of the present study we also aimed to identify novel natural mlo alleles. besides one presumptive mlo variant with a single amino acid polymorphism, we found the well-known mlo- <dig> allele in a set of additional powdery mildew resistant landraces and in two accessions from yemen. the latter result challenges the proposed origin of the mlo- <dig> mutant in the ethiopian highlands. based on our new findings it remains at present unclear whether the mlo- <dig> mutant was introduced from ethiopia to yemen or vice versa. in principle, the mlo- <dig> allele may have originated even from another country of this geographical area. this example highlights the difficulties in tracing the roots and authentic population structure of wild plant communities in the context of anthropogenic perturbations such as agriculture, trading and, more recently, tourism. this problem is also exemplified by the mlo- <dig> mutation that was found to be introgressed into a presumed turkish "landrace". descriptive analyses of natural accessions should thus be accompanied by supporting molecular analyses whenever possible.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide a comprehensive compilation of mlo mutants and their molecular defects that might be useful for plant breeding purposes and future research on mlo protein function. our data identifies the second and third cytoplasmic loop as functionally relevant sites of the polytopic barley mlo protein. in contrast, only mutant variants with defects in the bulky second cytoplasmic loop serve as substrates for the cellular erad quality control system. the findings suggest the presence of molecular "hot spots" for the recognition of malformed protein variants by the erad machinery.
