BACKGROUND
diabetes has become one of the most common chronic diseases, with the world prevalence among adults of  <dig> % in  <dig>  it has been estimated that this figure will increase to  <dig> % by  <dig>  with the absolute number increasing from  <dig> to  <dig> million  <cit> . type  <dig> diabetes  accounts for more than 90% of diabetes cases and is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. accumulating evidence suggests that t2d is a result of complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors  <cit> , supporting the notion that a healthier lifestyle may attenuate the adverse effects of t2d risk alleles, while an unhealthy lifestyle may augment it. dietary n- <dig> polyunsaturated fatty acids  have been demonstrated in rodents to increase insulin sensitivity through a number of different mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory effects, regulation of circulating hormones and transcription factors, with effects on membrane fluidity and improvements in lipid profiles  <cit> . in contrast, evidence from observational studies  <cit>  and clinical trials  <cit>  in humans shows inconsistent association between n- <dig> pufa and insulin sensitivity and t2d. these discrepancies may be attributed partly to the influence of genotype by environment  interactions with regard to n- <dig> pufa  <cit> .

different n- <dig> pufas may affect insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion through different mechanisms  <cit> . in a human randomized controlled trial  <cit> , eicosapentaenoic acid  and docosahexaenoic acid , the two major n- <dig> pufa, showed differential effects on glucose metabolism. in addition, the effect of alpha-linolenic acid  on insulin resistance and t2d differs from that of dha and epa  <cit> . thus, it can be postulated that the patterns for the interplay between n- <dig> pufa intake and the genome varies by type and intake level. however, studies characterizing the gxe interaction of different types of n- <dig> pufa with genotypes on t2d-related traits are sparse. our previous study demonstrated the importance of genome-wide gxe interactions in explaining phenotypic variance of diabetic traits  <cit> . to date, no published data are available as to what percentage of total variance of a given t2d-related trait can be explained by gxe interactions of individual n- <dig> pufa with the whole genome.

there were three primary objectives of the present study. one, as erythrocyte membrane n- <dig> pufas are widely accepted biomarkers for the dietary n- <dig> pufa intake, we sought to demonstrate the role of the gxe interaction between different types of erythrocyte n- <dig> pufas and genotypes for the variation of t2d-related traits at the genome-wide level. two, we explored the extent of these gxe variance contributions in a non-hispanic white population living in the u.s.a . three, for a given t2d-related trait, our study sought to identify a corresponding n- <dig> pufa that contributed the most significant gxe variance for each trait. replication was conducted in a puerto rican population living in the u.s.a.table  <dig>

RESULTS
genome-wide gxe variance contribution to the phenotypic variance of t2d traits
for each trait, gcta was conducted in goldn to assess the genome-wide variance contribution of genotype by erythrocyte n- <dig> pufas to total phenotypic variance. when the gxe was not included in the models, additive genetic variance contribution for homa-ir, fasting insulin, glucose and adiponectin was  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % , respectively. when the gxe term was included in the models for each homa-ir and fasting insulin, only dpa contributed a significant gxe variance to the total phenotypic variance  . the additive genetic variance ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for homa-ir depending on the pufa e factors , and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for fasting insulin . for fasting glucose,  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance  was explained by the gxe of the ratio of aa/, whereas  <dig> % of the variance was accounted for by additive genetic variance . the contributions of other e factors to the variance of these traits did not reach statistical significance. none of the gcta results were significant after bonferroni correction .table  <dig>

t2d is closely associated with inflammation and is considered an inflammatory disease  <cit> . adiponectin is well known for its anti-inflammatory effects in several tissues  <cit> , and recent evidence suggests that it is associated with t2d risk  <cit> . therefore, we treated fasting plasma adiponectin as a t2d-related trait and tested the gxe variance contribution to this trait. for adiponectin, the aa/ epa ratio in goldn contributed a marginally significant gxe variance  . although only marginally significant, the variance of adiponectin explained by the additive genetic variance was stable in different gxe models, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % .

to test whether the significant gxe variance contribution of one e factor was affected by the other e factors, we used data from goldn to pair the nominally significant e factor with another e factor simultaneously in the gcta model . for example, for both homa-ir and fasting insulin, we paired dpa with total n- <dig> pufa, n- <dig> pufa or dha in the model. inclusion of either e factor did not alter the nominally significant gxe variance contribution of dpa. we paired the aa/ ratio with total n-3/n- <dig> ratio or epa + dha for fasting glucose, and consistently, the nominally significant contribution of gxe variance of aa/ ratio did not change. however, for adiponectin, the p-values for the gxe contribution of both epa and the aa/epa ratio were attenuated when they were included in the same model, due to the high correlation between erythrocyte measures of aa/epa and epa . as proxies for long-term dietary intakes, both factors represented the same gxe variance for adiponectin.table  <dig>

gxe interaction of n- <dig> pufas at the genome-wide level
to illustrate further the significance of the contribution of g×e interaction of pufa on diabetes-related phenotypes, a g×e gwas was conducted in goldn for the gcta-identified significant e factor using the gwaf . for each trait, we identified one e factor, which contributed a nominally significant gxe variance using gcta, and another e factor, which contributed a non-significant gxe variance, serving as control. for homa-ir, the gxe gwas of dpa identified nine significant snps , but just three for ala, the control e factor. of greater interest, the gxe gwas of dpa for fasting insulin identified  <dig> significant snps but only six for the control e factor . similarly, the gcta-identified significant e factors for fasting glucose and for adiponectin each produced more significant snps in the gxe gwas, compared with their corresponding control e factors. the number of gxe gwas-identified snps  for fasting glucose and its significant e factor aa/ was  <dig>  with just a single snp identified for the corresponding control e factor. for adiponectin, there were  <dig> gxe gwas-identified snps  with the aa/epa as the significant e factor, and  <dig> for the corresponding control e factor. for either trait, the qq-plot drawn based on the p-values of gxe interaction were slightly above the diagonal line for the e factor, which contributed a significant g×e variance, while for the control e factor, the qq-plot aligned well with the diagonal line . these qq-plots confirm the gcta results.table  <dig>

discussion
while it is increasingly recognized that the interplay between genetic and environmental factors contributes to t2d risk  <cit> , inconsistencies among studies often obscure the importance of gxe interactions. the effects of n- <dig> pufas on chronic disease and related intermediate phenotypes, for example, have been studied throughout the last five decades, but discrepancies still exist with regard to outcomes involving human studies  <cit> . one of these divergences is the association between n- <dig> pufa and t2d phenotypes . apart from the methodological differences among studies, the influence of genetic variation is likely an important contributor. previous studies have identified numerous candidate genes that may have an influence on the effects of n- <dig> pufa on t2d or related traits  <cit> . recent advances in gwas provide the opportunity to explore the influence of n- <dig> pufa gxe on t2d and related traits at the genome-wide level. in the present study, we used a new method to illustrate to what extent the gxe of n- <dig> pufa contributed to the variations of t2d-related traits and to characterize the most important gxe variance contributor among these fatty acids at the genome level. this approach, for the first time, gives a more detailed depiction of the interplay between different types of n- <dig> pufa and a set of ~ <dig>  genetic variants, and their influence on the t2d-related phenotypes. in addition, we were able to distinguish the different gxe patterns for different n- <dig> pufa in red blood cells, which provides a solid rationale for future research on the impact of different n- <dig> pufas with regard to disease risk and health maintenance in humans.

consistent results from rodent models support the anti-diabetic effects of marine n- <dig> pufa  <cit> , while in humans most prospective cohort studies conducted in western countries have found null or even positive associations between n- <dig> pufa and risk of t2d  <cit> . in a meta-analysis of these cohort studies, we suggested that genetic and gxe interactions may contribute to these inconsistent associations in western populations  <cit> . previous studies, most of which employed a candidate gene approach, have identified a number of genetic variants showing gxe with n- <dig> pufa on t2d-related traits  <cit> . however, given the powerful regulatory effects of n- <dig> pufas, candidate gene approaches can provide only a narrow view of possible gxe interactions for n- <dig> pufas. overcoming this restriction, our genome-wide studies with gcta have supplied much information on the interaction of erythrocyte membrane n- <dig> pufas on t2d-related traits. we further illustrated the gcta results by conducting a gxe gwas.

different n- <dig> pufas, such as ala, epa, dpa and dha, likely exert their health-related effects through different mechanisms. among these fatty acids, the literature regarding the biological effects of dpa is relatively limited  <cit> . dpa is an intermediate product of fatty acid metabolism between epa and dha, and available evidence suggests that dpa has both unique as well as overlapping actions compared to dha and epa. in vivo and in vitro studies  <cit>  have indicated that the biological effects of dpa mainly stemmed from its effects on eicosanoid production, endothelial cell migration and gene expression related to lipogenic and inflammatory genes. however, to our knowledge, studies characterizing the effects of dpa on t2d-related traits are sparse and no published reports are available with regard to the gxe of dpa with genetic variants on t2d traits. erythrocyte dpa contributed a nominally significant gxe variance to the total variance of homa-ir and fasting insulin at the genome-wide level. these results did not change when we paired dpa with other erythrocyte membrane e factors, such as total n- <dig> pufa, total n- <dig> pufa or dha, in the gcta model. this indicated that the dpa gxe variance contribution was independent of these e factors.

it is known that phenotypic flexibility decreases with age and onset of pre-clinical conditions. when the environment  is perturbed, there is reduced ability to identify susceptibility variants by gwas, implying a widespread influence for gxe interactions on phenotypic variance  <cit> . thus, although the two populations examined here are subject to different environmental influences, some of the gxe interactions we have identified are biologically plausible. for example, one snp  near ppargc1b interacted with dpa for both homa-ir and fasting insulin. ppargc1b encodes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  gamma co-activator 1-beta, and is a transcriptional co-factor contributing to the regulation of fat oxidation, energy expenditure and glucose metabolism  <cit> . furthermore, ppargc1b expression is down-regulated in skeletal muscle of t2d patients  <cit> . therefore, it can be postulated that dpa regulates ppargc1b expression and subsequently affects glucose metabolism in an allele-specific manner. another example shows that six of the  <dig> gxe gwas-identified snps for fasting insulin locate near the crpp <dig> and crp genes, indicating that dpa may regulate insulin concentrations through an effect on c-reactive protein and inflammatory pathways  <cit> . however, future research is warranted to characterize the functions of these identified snps and to explore the precise mechanism for the effect of dpa on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism.

other interesting findings include the aa/ ratio contribution of a nominally significant gxe variance for fasting glucose, and the aa/epa ratio contribution of a marginally significant gxe variance for adiponectin in goldn, which was not replicated in a second population. as indicated  <cit> , important roles for the n-6/n- <dig> pufa ratio in coronary artery disease, hypertension and t2d, diseases affected by chronic inflammation. aa is the principle precursor for eicosanoid production, including 2-series prostaglandins and 4-series leukotrienes, and these products are highly active agents of inflammation  <cit> . in contrast, both epa and dha have anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit the production of those pro-inflammatory biomarkers  <cit> . adiponectin is an anti-inflammatory biomarker, and thus sensitive to changes in the n-6/n- <dig> pufa ratio. our results indicate that the n-6/n- <dig> pufa ratio affects the genetic susceptibility of fasting glucose and adiponectin. combining genetic additive variance and gxe variance of the n-6/n- <dig> ratio explained more phenotypic variation of these two traits than genetic effects alone. nevertheless, the results for adiponectin should be interpreted with caution because none of the gxe variance contribution of adiponectin reached statistical significance.

the gcta method of estimating the gxe variance contribution enables us to view the pattern of the interplay between n- <dig> pufa and the genome, and to re-examine the different roles of individual n- <dig> pufas or the related n-6/n- <dig> ratio in human health and disease. however, some limitations are present in this study. first, overestimation of the genetic and gxe variance may exist given the family-based nature of the goldn population, including their shared environments within family and causal variants captured by pedigree, but not by snps  <cit> . this is also the reason why the estimates of heritability are generally higher in goldn than in bprhs, a population comprised of unrelated individuals. second, the sample size of the present study is moderate. studies with larger sample size and populations of different ethnicities, but equally deeply phenotyped, are needed to confirm our results. third, none of our primary gcta results was significant after bonferroni correction for multiple testing. however, the bonferroni correction is very conservative and may not be the most appropriate correction method to apply in this circumstance. nevertheless, our results from gcta were further confirmed by a gxe gwas and replicated in part  in a second population.

CONCLUSIONS
we used a gcta method to explore the gxe variance contribution of erythrocyte membrane n- <dig> pufa to the variation of t2d-related traits at the genome-wide level. we demonstrated that, at the genome-wide level, different types of n- <dig> pufa can contribute different gxe variances to the same phenotype, and the same n- <dig> pufa contributes different amounts of gxe variances to different phenotypes. these results indicate the importance of the gxe of n- <dig> pufas for major diabetes traits, and also suggest the extent to which these gxe interactions contribute to the variation of each trait. our results have important implications for public health research in that long-chain n- <dig> pufas have been accepted widely as dietary supplements around the world, while the effects of n- <dig> pufas on major chronic diseases, such as t2d and cardiovascular disease, remain inconclusive. the genome-wide influence of n- <dig> pufa gxe explains some of these inconsistencies, and future dietary recommendations should consider the effects of genetic variation, especially as personalized nutrition gains acceptance. furthermore, a mechanism for the unique function of each individual n- <dig> pufa warrants more comprehensive research.
