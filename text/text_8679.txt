BACKGROUND
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  is a late onset systemic disorder characterised by the progressive development of multiple fluid filled cysts in the kidney, ultimately leading to renal failure  <cit> . peters and sandkuijl  <cit>  estimated that in affected individuals of european descent approximately 85% of adpkd is due to mutations in the gene pkd <dig> , located on chromosome 16p <dig> . about  <dig> kb of the pkd <dig> region in 16p <dig>  is inserted and reiterated in several copies in 16p <dig> , comprising six pseudogenes  <cit> . only  <dig>  kb of the pkd <dig> transcript, located at the 3'end of the gene, is unique to pkd <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the human situation there is only one pkd <dig> gene on mouse chromosome  <dig> and no further pseudogenes could be detected  <cit> . the question arose how the human situation originated phylogenetically. besides single-base-pair mutations, sequence duplications and chromosomal rearrangements are the primary forces by which any genome evolves over time  <cit> . various models of genomic duplications, e.g. the duplicative transposition or the endoduplication, have been documented. the duplicative transposition of a genomic block of material  leads to segmental duplications within a chromosome/genome  <cit> , which are also known as low copy repeat sequences, that mediate recurrent chromosomal structural rearrangements  <cit> . these segmental duplications are often harbouring a part of a gene containing intron and exon structures, which leads to the accumulation of unprocessed pseudogenes. such duplications appear to have arisen in very recent evolutionary time , as judged by the high sequence identity  seen both in introns and exons  <cit> . interestingly, human chromosome  <dig> is one of the most enriched chromosomes for segmental duplications. they are particularly clustered along the p arm of the chromosome  <cit> . in contrast to duplicative transpositions, endoduplications originate from tandem duplication events of local chromosomal regions mediated by unequal crossover. in the case of pkd <dig> both models of genomic duplications can be implicated. first, the duplicative transposition as a hallmark for the separation of the pseudogenes from the pkd <dig> gene and second, the endoduplication among the pseudogenes as some of them are located next to each other in the same orientation, indicating a tandem duplication event  <cit> .

fluorescence in situ hybridization  is the main physical mapping tool to identify chromosomal rearrangements among closely related species  <cit> . therefore we applied comparative fish-mapping of a human pkd1-containing bac clone and a pkd1-cdna clone to chromosomes of human, great apes, gibbon, old world and new world monkeys, lemurs and the dog as a non-primate outgroup species. here we report the localization of the pkd <dig> gene and its pseudogenes. moreover, with the advent of whole-genome sequencing, a highly accurate human genome sequence  <cit>  and draft sequences of the chimpanzee  <cit> , the orangutan  <cit> , the rhesus macaque  <cit>  and the common marmoset  <cit>  genome have been generated. this offers the possibility for phylogenetic and comparative analyses of human and chimpanzee sequences of pkd <dig> genes and pseudogenes taking the rhesus macaque as an outgroup.

methods
tissue samples
blood samples of chimpanzee , pygmy chimpanzee , lowland gorilla , sumatran orangutan , and bornean orangutan  were obtained from the zoologisch-botanischer garten wilhelma in stuttgart, germany, the zoologischer garten berlin, germany, and the zoologischer garten leipzig, germany. blood samples of the lar gibbon , the proboscis monkey , and the black-handed spider monkey  were also obtained from the zoologisch-botanischer garten wilhelma in stuttgart, germany. blood probes of the mueller's or grey gibbon , the rhesus macaque , the pig-tailed macaque , and the ring-tailed lemur  were received from the zoologischer garten münster, germany, the zoologischer garten antwerpen, belgium, and the deutsches primatenzentrum in göttingen, germany. from prof. dr. y. rumpler in strasbourgh, france, we received blood samples from the ring-tailed lemur , and the brown lemur . blood probes from the domestic dog  we got from dr. r. stanyon in firenze, italy.

chromosome preparation
standard chromosome preparation methods were applied to peripheral lymphocyte cultures of human, primates and the domestic dog  <cit> .

fluorescence in situ hybridization 
prior to fish, the slides were treated with rnase followed by pepsin digestion as described in  <cit> . fish followed essentially the methods already described in  <cit> . chromosome in situ suppression was applied to the probes bac rp11-304l <dig>  which harbours the complete pkd <dig> gene and several additional genes. the bac was originally purchased from research genetics, inc.,  and a  <dig>  kb long partial pkd1-cdna clone covering the exons 15– <dig> of the pkd <dig> gene . in our fish-experiments bac clone rp11-304l <dig> was referred to as "bac", the pkd1-cdna clone as "cdna". after fish the slides were counterstained with dapi  and mounted in vectashield .

fluorescence microscopy and imaging
preparations were evaluated using a zeiss axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with single-band pass filters for excitation of red, green and blue . during exposures, only excitation filters were changed allowing for pixel-shift-free image recording. images of high magnification and resolution were obtained using a black-and-white ccd camera  connected to the axiophot. camera control and digital image acquisition involved the use of an apple macintosh quadra  <dig> computer.

sequence conservation analyses
sequences orthologous to human pkd <dig> intron  <dig> were identified in the whole genome assemblies of the rat , mouse , cat , dog , horse , and opossum  by using human intron  <dig> anchored with flanking exons as a query sequence. all mammalian sequences were extracted and multiple sequence alignments carried out using clustalw  <dig>   <cit> . pairwise identities for intron  <dig> were calculated directly from the clustalw alignments.

phylogenetic analyses
human sequences paralogous to the human pkd <dig> master gene genomic locus  were obtained from genbank as follows: pkd1p1: ng_002797; pkd1p2: ng_002795; pkd1p3: ng_002796; pkd1p4: ng_002800; pkd1p5: ng_002798; pkd1p6: ng_ <dig>  phylogenetic analysis was focused on the largest intron  common for all gene loci . subsequently, primate sequences orthologous and paralogous to the human intron  <dig> sequence were identified in the whole genome sequence assemblies of the chimpanzee , orangutan , and rhesus macaque . sequences were extracted, multiple sequence alignments generated using clustalw  <dig>   <cit>  and gap-containing positions removed. pairwise identities of all sequences were based on the clustalw alignments. modeltest  <cit>  was used to select the model of nucleotide substitution best fitting the sequences. the nucleotide sequence phylogeny was built using an ml model for nucleotide data with the parameters defined by modeltest . the pkd <dig> intron  <dig> topology was initially assessed using parsimony and distance-related nonparametric bootstrapping. no topological differences were noted for the nucleotide phylogenies.

the topology of the phylogenetic tree was used to match pairs of human and chimpanzee pseudogene copies according to their comparable positions within the phylogram. as a reference, the pair of human and chimpanzee master gene sequences was used. subsequently, seven independent multiple alignments were generated by clustalw  <dig>   <cit> , gap-containing positions removed and a phylogenetic tree created using dnaml  <dig>  c  <cit> . branch lengths including confidence limits and p-values  are documented in table  <dig>  strong indication for the correctness of the branch length is noted when two gene/pseudogene copies had a p-value that was less than  <dig>  for five different types of statistical tests.

** = significantly positive, p <  <dig> 

human and chimpanzee pkd <dig> intron  <dig> sequences were further analyzed using geneconv  <dig>   <cit> . fragments shared by a pair of dna sequences in a multiple alignment presenting more consecutive identical polymorphic sites in common than expected by chance are identified. evidence for gene conversion is indicated when a fragment had a p-value less than  <dig>  after multiple correction of the p-values.

RESULTS
the chromosomal location of pkd <dig> sequences was defined by applying one- and two-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation  of two human-derived probes, the pkd1-containing bac clone rp11-304l <dig> and the pkd1-cdna clone hg 31918n <dig>  to prometaphase or metaphase chromosomes of human, great apes, gibbon, old world and new world monkeys, lemurs and the dog as a non-primate outgroup species. during our search for pkd <dig> sequences in primates and one representative of the carnivores, the orthologous regions to the human short arm chromosome  <dig> could be identified with the assistance of several published chromosomal painting papers. presenting our comparative fish-results in human and great apes we applied the system of orthologous numbering of human and great ape chromosomes  <cit> .

comparative mapping in human and great apes
fish with the bac clone on human chromosomes revealed the expected prominent pkd1- signal distal in 16p <dig> , as well as a signal cluster in 16p <dig> , where the pseudogenes are localized . hybridizations with the cdna clone confirmed the localizations found with the bac clone, but showed weaker pkd1-signals in 16p <dig>  .

for both chimpanzee and bonobo chromosomes  <dig> identical fish-results were obtained. three clearly separated pkd1-signals could be detected with the bac clone, showing a strong pkd1-signal in distal 16p <dig>  weaker signals in proximal 16p <dig> and a third distinct signal in 16p <dig>  distal to the short arm heterochromatin . detection with the cdna clone could confirm these three localizations, but showed weaker pkd1-signals in distal 16p <dig> . according to our results the dapi-bright heterochromatin of both the chimpanzee and the bonobo chromosome  <dig> maps to the proximal short arm on the side of the pkd1-signals, but not to the proximal long arm as presented in the ideogrammatic drawing in iscn  <cit> . indeed, this pericentric inversion bringing the dapi-bright heterochromatin to the proximal short arm of chimpanzee chromosome  <dig> was recently established by means of molecular breakpoint analysis  <cit> .

likewise, in gorilla with the bac clone three clearly separated pkd1-signals were detected in the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  a strong signal was detected in distal 16p <dig>  and two weaker signals in proximal 16p <dig> and in 16p <dig>  respectively . hybridizations with the cdna clone revealed the same pkd1-signal pattern but with equal signal intensities for all three locations .

a different situation is given for the chromosome  <dig> of the orangutan subspecies from sumatra. our fish results obtained with the bac clone revealed strong pkd1-signals in distal 16p <dig> . hybridizations with the cdna clone confirmed this result, however, weaker pkd1-signals were detected . the same results we achieved for the bornean orangutan .

comparative mapping in gibbons and old world monkeys
hybridizations with the bac and cdna clones on chromosomes of mueller's gibbon , and lar gibbon  revealed strong pkd1-signals in distal 8p <dig> . the signals appear very strong and clustered after using the bac as a probe  but weaker when the cdna was used as a probe . this distal region in 8p <dig> was shown to be orthologous to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . fish with bac and cdna clones on chromosomes of the rhesus macaque  and the pig-tailed macaque  revealed pkd1-signals in the distal short arm of chromosome  <dig> , the orthologous chromosome to human chromosome  <dig> . using both the bac and the cdna clones on chromosomes of the proboscis monkey  pkd1-signals appeared again in the distal short arm of chromosome  <dig> , the orthologous chromosome to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

comparative mapping in a new world monkey, lemurs and the dog
performing fish with bac and cdna clones on chromosomes of one representative of the new world monkeys, the black-handed spider monkey, we could unequivocally map distinct pkd1-signals distal in 1q <dig> , which could be defined as the orthologous region to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . hybridizations with either the bac or cdna clone on lemur chromosomes revealed distinct pkd1-signals in the distal long arm of chromosome  <dig> of the brown lemur  and in the distal short arm of chromosome  <dig> of the ring-tailed lemur . chromosome  <dig> of the brown lemur could be described as the orthologous chromosome to human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , and chromosome  <dig> of the ring-tailed lemur as orthologous to the short arm of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . fish with the pkd <dig> bac clone on chromosomes of the domestic dog revealed one very distinct pkd1-signal in the middle of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> , the orthologous chromosome to the short arm of human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> .

comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses
based on the current genome reference sequence assemblies of human , chimpanzee , orangutan , rhesus macaque , and common marmoset  we identified the master gene and  <dig> pseudogenes for pkd <dig> in human  and chimpanzee , respectively, while only a single-copy pkd <dig> gene was present in orangutan, rhesus macaque and common marmoset. pairwise sequence comparisons of all pseudogene copies with the corresponding master gene revealed intron  <dig> as the longest stretch  of non-coding dna present in all genes/pseudogenes. it was previously shown that intron  <dig> of the pkd <dig> master gene shows a remarkable sequence conservation  <cit> . to assess the sequence conservation of intron  <dig>  we performed multiple pairwise sequence comparisons of sequences orthologous to human intron  <dig> from six mammalian species . except for the mouse-rat pairwise alignment , all other percent identities ranged from 45% to 56% indicating no sequence conservation. to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of master genes and pseudogenes, we compared all intron  <dig> sequences by carrying out a clustalw alignment. irrespective of the model of nucleotide substitution determined by modeltest  <cit>  and the criteria used to analyze the sequence data in paup* <dig> b  <cit> , phylogenetic reconstruction of pkd <dig> using intron  <dig> always indicated that all human pseudogenes are closely related to the human pkd <dig> gene, and all chimpanzee pseudogenes are closely related to the chimpanzee pkd <dig> gene . from an evolutionary point of view, and also with regard to our fish results in human and great apes, it seems very unlikely that pkd <dig> pseudogenes originated independently in human and chimpanzee lineages. in addition, bearing in mind previous reports on pseudogene-mediated gene conversion to pkd <dig>  <cit> , this prompted us to search for indications of concerted evolution in the pkd <dig> family members in human and chimpanzee.

indications for concerted evolution
in a first approach we made use of the phylogenetic tree of pkd <dig> intron  <dig> rooted on the rhesus macaque . based on the topology of this tree we matched seven pairs of orthologous pkd1-loci from human and chimpanzee . seven phylograms independently created with the pkd <dig> master genes of orangutan and rhesus macaque together with one pair of orthologous pkd <dig> loci from human and chimpanzee showed for all pkd <dig> loci, with the exception of human pkd1p <dig>  almost identical branch lengths  of  <dig> – <dig> . this indicates that these pseudogenes may have originated before the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged.

subsequently, we calculated the pairwise nucleotide sequence identities among all pseudogenes and the master genes of human, chimp, orangutan and rhesus macaque .

in general, the human paralogous pseudogenes as well as the chimpanzee paralogous pseudogenes are more closely related among each other, respectively, than are the orthologous pkd <dig> master genes of both species. as reviewed in chen et al.  <cit>  this result is a clear indication that gene conversion may have occurred among pkd <dig> pseudogenes in human and chimpanzee, respectively.

in addition, the human and chimpanzee pkd <dig> intron  <dig> sequences were scanned for potential recombinant sequences by geneconv analysis, which is a well-established method for detecting partial gene conversion  <cit> . in human, four dna-fragments ranging in size from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp were identified which are significantly more similar to each other than would be expected by chance, even after correction for multiple testing . thus, geneconv indicates partial gene conversion between human pkd <dig> pseudogenes p <dig> and p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  as well as p <dig> and p <dig>  respectively. surprisingly, in the chimpanzee, a gene conversion between the pkd <dig> master gene and pseudogene  <dig> is indicated .

taken together, our three-pronged approach yielded substantial evidence for, at least, concerted evolution between pkd <dig> pseudogene copies in human.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we applied comparative fish-mapping with two human derived probes, the pkd1-containing genomic bac clone rp11-304l <dig> and the pkd1-cdna clone hg 31918n <dig>  to localize pkd1-sequences on chromosomes of a variety of primates, including humans, and the dog as a non-primate outgroup-species.

in order to decide whether the pkd1-signals found in each species can be regarded as a single-copy signal or if duplications/amplifications must be taken into consideration, we compared our results with those obtained in human, in which the master pkd <dig> gene maps to 16p <dig>  and six pkd <dig> pseudogenes map to 16p <dig>   <cit> , and in the domestic dog, in which a single copy signal situation for the orthologous pkd <dig> gene is established  <cit> . as schematically summarized in fig.  <dig>  fish with pkd <dig> clones in the human reveal a distinct and weaker signal in the distal short arm in 16p <dig>  and a more proximal signal-cluster in 16p <dig> , which is in accordance with the above cited human sequencing data. on the other hand, hybridization of the genomic bac clone on chromosomes of the domestic dog detect a very distinct single signal confirming the results of dackowski et al.  <cit> , and allow us to map the orthologous pkd <dig> gene in 6q <dig> of the dog. as in the human, in chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla a distinct and weaker signal can be detected in their distal short arms after fish with pkd1-cdna. however, in contrast to one proximal signal-cluster in human 16p <dig> , two clearly separated signals appear in the proximal short arms of chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla chromosomes  <dig>  summarizing our fish results for homo, pan and gorilla, the master pkd <dig> gene is located in the subtelomeric short arms of the orthologous chromosomes  <dig>  respectively, while the chromosomal arrangement of the amplified pseudogenes may have occurred by further intrachromosomal rearrangements in a species-specific manner. this is not in contradiction to the work of misceo et al.  <cit> , having shown that the short arm of chromosome  <dig> is highly conserved in human and great apes. the bac clones from human 16p they have used for comparative fish  neither interfere with the subtelomeric position of the pkd <dig> gene, nor with the map positions of the pkd <dig> pseudogenes, at least in the human.

interestingly, in both orangutan subspecies from sumatra and borneo, and in all phylogenetically more distant species investigated only single pkd1-signals were detected at chromosomal sites orthologous to human chromosome  <dig>  thus, we may infer a single-copy pkd <dig> gene for all these species. indeed, only a single pkd <dig> gene is present in the current genome sequence assembly of the orangutan  <cit> , the rhesus macaque  <cit> , and the common marmoset  <cit> . due to the limited resolution of the fish-technique we cannot exclude a duplication/amplification of pkd <dig> at the chromosomal signal sites of the other primates investigated.

in conclusion, with regard to our comparative fish-data it seems very likely, that the original duplication of the pkd <dig> gene and further amplification and evolution of the pkd <dig> pseudogenes may have occurred in a common ancestor of homo, pan and gorilla ~8mya.

our combinatorial phylogenetic tree analysis using intron  <dig> from human and chimpanzee pkd1-loci, with orangutan and macaque as outgroup species, raises the impression of an independent evolution of the pkd <dig> pseudogenes from their master pkd <dig> genes in human and chimpanzee . however, it should be noted that a complex genome architecture with all pkd <dig> pseudogenes being embedded in segmental duplications has been documented for the short arm of human  <cit>  and chimpanzee  <cit>  chromosome  <dig>  indeed, several studies have shown that reticulate evolutionary processes, such as nonallelic homologous recombination  and gene conversion occur within specific duplicon families, and molecular clock analysis and calculations based on sequence comparisons are confounded by these processes  <cit> . interestingly, there are several reports presenting evidence that mutations in human pkd <dig> are caused via pseudogene-mediated gene conversion leading to adpkd  <cit> ,  <cit> . our own statistical analyses provided clear indications for gene conversion and/or nahr that may have occurred among pkd <dig> family members in human and chimpanzee, respectively. one further aspect to be considered is the use of intron  <dig> for our sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree building. our decision to focus on intron  <dig> was directed by the fact that the pkd <dig> exons are densely packed on the genomic level and intron  <dig> is the largest intron  present in all pkd <dig> loci in human and chimpanzee, respectively. on the other hand, the evolutionarily highly conserved last intron  of pkd <dig>  <cit>  raises the question of whether there are other forces affecting intron  <dig> evolution. however, we did not find evidence of high sequence conservation in intron  <dig> 

in conclusion, notwithstanding our results using intron  <dig> for phylogenetic tree building, it seems more likely that all six pkd1-pseudogenes evolved in a common ancestor of human and chimpanzee. after separation of both lineages there was internal correction of the genes/pseudogenes resulting in co-evolution of these genes within each species. by inference from an equally complex fish-signal pattern of pkd <dig> shown in gorilla 16p, the species gorilla may well be included in this scenario of pkd <dig> evolution, suggesting that the original duplication of pkd <dig> may have occurred before gorillas and humans diverged ~8mya.
