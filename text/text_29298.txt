BACKGROUND
the process of tumorigenesis has long been recognized to depend upon complex interactions of a tumor with its non-transformed tissue environment  <cit> . beyond transformation and increased proliferation, many pathways are activated both in the growing tumor and its environment to culminate in an established solid tumor. for example, adhesive pathways are activated to enable transformed cells to aggregate and form a microtumor. subsequently, microtumors must avoid destruction by the immune system and elicit vasculature formation for continued growth  <cit> . in support of these events, cell-matrix adhesion proteins, cell surface antigens, angiogenic factors and modulatory agents have been found differentially expressed in several experimental models of tumorigenesis  <cit>  and in tumor biopsy samples relative to control tissues  <cit> . experimental models with established tumorigenic human cell lines have compared the gene expression profiles between the cultured parental cells and after implantation into immune-deficient murine hosts  <cit> . in this study, we examined this problem with a more focused approach with respect to the transcripts as well as a broader survey by examining multiple tumor sources in order to identify differential genes common to multiple solid tumors in a xenograft model of tumorigenesis.

to recapitulate the attachment and growth of a micro- or metastatic tumor, our experimental tumorigenesis model examined human xenograft tumors in nude mice. it is believed that primary or metastatic microtumors about  <dig> mm <dig> in size are metastable; they are either  resolved by the immune system,  remain in a steady-state with balanced proliferation and apoptosis or  undergo aggressive growth as long as a vasculature is developed to provide nutrients to the growing mass  <cit> . since the end-point of the xenograft assay is the formation of a solid tumor, genes supporting vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are likely differentially expressed relative to the parental cell lines that were adapted to culture in vitro. however, the extent of vascularization to support an established tumor will vary according to the tumor type and tissue environment as a result of variable levels of proteases, receptors or regulators of pericyte and/or endothelial migration, proliferation, and differentiation  <cit> . additionally, some tumors such as early grade astrocytomas can leverage existing normal brain blood vessels without substantial vasculogenesis for subsequent angiogenic sprouting of new vessels from preexisting vessels  <cit> . further, vascularization depends upon a tuned interaction in the tissue microenvironment between endothelial cells and pericytes  <cit> . vascularization of solid tumors may also be heterogeneous with a rapidly growing margin surrounding a hypoxic core following regression of co-opted vessels that supported early tumor growth  <cit> . complicating this picture is the potential for vascular mimicry' where breast tumor derived cells express endothelial markers and may serve as rudimentary channels  <cit> .

many angiogenesis studies have used cultured primary vascular endothelial cells and shown the significant roles of vegf, fgf, pdgf, chemokines and cell-matrix adhesion proteins  <cit> . these assays for endothelial cell migration include the chorioallantoic membrane  <cit> , matrigel migration assays  <cit>  or 3d-collagen assays  <cit> . however, the limits of studying the angiogenic process with established endothelial cells in vitro have been recognized. tumorigenesis involves both heterophilic and homophilic cellular communication and adhesion between not only endothelial cells but also pericytes and smooth muscle cells; hence other cell surface proteins and secreted factors are absent from such assays  <cit> .

a search for tumorigenic genes common to tumors of diverse origin should be as broad as possible and hence should not be limited to a single tumor type or tissue source. in order to find common tumorigenic genes regardless of tissue origin, we chose to study a panel of  <dig> adenocarcinoma cell lines from breast, colon, and lung, ovarian and prostate tumors. these cell lines reproducibly yield solid tumors in a standard xenograft assay in immuno-compromised mice  <cit> . while there may be individual differences in capillary branching or density between tumor types, the xenograft assay requires vascular development to support solid tumor formation in a relatively avascular subcutaneous site.

since the early tumorigenic events largely rely upon secreted factors, cell surface receptors or integral membrane proteins, we devised a strategy to employ a custom microarray to focus on the expression of genes chosen on the basis of their cellular localization. hence, we implemented an experimental microarray strategy with high replication and coverage of all possible secreted and cell surface proteins. also, focusing on all known and predicted cell surface and secreted genes allowed us to design more intra-chip replicates for improved data reliability. while prioritizing on the 'function' category of the gene ontology  <cit> , the range of 'biological processes' covered by the gene selection remained broad. in contrast to early concerns that a sub-selection of genes might result in a systemic bias, relatively small numbers of genes were found to be common to all xenograft tumors due to the robust experimental design and statistical analysis.

RESULTS
we developed a custom 60-mer oligonucleotide microarray to focus on an ontologically restricted set of secreted and cell surface genes for higher data reliability using a matrix design with intra-chip replicates in addition to replicate chips. due to the limits of the gene ontology classification, multiple strategies had to be used to derive a relatively complete collection of secreted and cell surface genes. for example, some proteins have multiple localization sites on the basis of newer experimental evidence absent from curated databases; e.g. sorcs <dig>  hdgf. for proteins with multiple cellular localizations, the literature  was the annotation source for finding other secreted and cell surface proteins. finally, other putative secreted and transmembrane-encoding genes and exons were analyzed from hypothetical predictions from the ucsc human genome. redundant genes were removed by a combination of blastn/blastp comparisons and manual curation, but many putative membrane-encoding exons of potential proteins were included. a final tally of  <dig> genes was composed of  <dig> secreted genes,  <dig> g-protein coupled receptor  genes with the remainder classified as various integral membrane proteins and cell surface proteins. an ontological view of the custom chip's content is shown in fig.  <dig>  finally, in consideration of potential global changes of a selected set of genes, numerous positive and negative controls were included in the array design; including genes characteristic of some tumors  and many 'housekeeping' transcripts  commonly used to normalize quantitative pcr studies. however, co-hybridizing all samples with a reference cdna derived from a mixture of  <dig> human cell lines enabled 'normalization' with respect to feature, chip, and dye for the manova analysis. this strategy minimizes the potential concern for a skewed normalization by a sub-selected gene population or possible differential behavior of the included 'housekeeping' genes in the xenograft tumors.

identification of characteristic tumor-specific genes by all tumor data or individual tumor types by multivariate analysis of variation
we performed several multivariate analyses of the microarray data to find characteristic tumorigenic genes. the maanova tools  <cit>  were chosen for their sensitivity and robustness in measuring differential expression versus previous t-test and log-ratio methods using thresholds for induction or suppression. this was particularly important in these studies that used a relatively complex design with on-chip and inter-chip probe replication, multiple tumor samples and tumor types, dye-swap and a common reference rna sample for all hybridizations. thus, this strategy helps avoid any systematic bias from using a chip containing probes for only secreted and cell surface genes. we developed a custom database  <cit>  to allow dynamic re-grouping of data to facilitate multiple analytical models such as all tumor data or individual tumor types and their parental cell lines.

initially, we identified the differentially expressed genes in all tumors relative to all parental cells regardless of tissue origin. hence compared all the xenograft tumor data to all the parental cell line data without regard to tumor type. similarly, both the tumor and parental cell line data were compared to the all reference cdna hybridization data. these data were analyzed by both principal components analysis  and multivariate analysis of variance .

principal components analysis
to visualize all tumor and parental cell data and assess overall quality, we subjected the entire dataset to principal components analysis. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a discrete segmentation of the data into  <dig> major aggregates corresponding to xenografts , parental cell lines  and the universal reference cdna  can be identified. the third principal component shown by the vertical y-axis provided the best separation between parental cell data and the xenograft tumor data, fig.  <dig> 

linear discriminant analysis
in order to identify a profile characteristic of xenograft tumors where the combination of multiple genes might be more predictive than any single gene, we performed a linear discriminant analysis. hence, we iteratively 'trimmed' versions of the third principal component since it had the highest correlation to sample type. the 'trimmed' list of coefficients were tested to determine their accuracy in assigning samples to either the tumor or cell line categories. this analysis retained  <dig> of the largest coefficients of the third principal component and represents a simple linear discriminant  of  <dig> probes that corresponds to  <dig> genes. the profile of  <dig> probes fairly accurately distinguishes between the two sample types of parental cell lines and xenograft tumors, fig. 3a. in 'leave-one-out' testing where each of the  <dig> samples was removed in separate analyses, this method generated a profile that was  <dig> % accurate in predicting a xenograft tumor. the same method applied to  <dig> label-permuted datasets never exceeded 65% accuracy with a median and minimum accuracy of 49% and  <dig> % respectively. this suggests that the gene profile generated by our analysis can distinguish between the xenograft data and the cell line data in a verifiable manner.

ontological classification of genes identified by a linear discriminant
the 54-gene profile derived from the linear discriminant  was distributed amongst numerous biological processes using the gene ontology classification terms, table  <dig>  many genes were classified in multiple biological process categories as a result of their biological complexity; e.g. fibronectin  is classified into  <dig> biological processes including cell motility, response to stress, cell communication, response to external stimuli, extracellular matrix structural constituent, protein binding and glycosaminoglycan binding. other genes are involved with cell adhesion or extracellular matrix, cellular growth or the regulation of cellular proliferation, various membrane proteins with known or inferred functions, transporters or channels, and proteases or protease inhibitors. a non-redundant ontological classification of the genes identified by the linear discriminant is shown with a graphical representation of their behavior across all tumor types, fig 3b. since the linear discriminant analysis uses a weighted sum, not all of the identified genes behaved consistently across all xenograft tumors; e.g. cd <dig> or col4a <dig>  fig 3b.

a level  <dig> annotation of the biological process gene ontology terms was applied to the list. due to biological complexity, a gene can occur in more than one category.

analysis of variation of all xenograft data
the expression data was also subjected to anova using all xenograft and parental cell line data. in this analysis, the type of tumor or parental line was ignored. this analysis identified  <dig> probes representing  <dig> differentially regulated genes at the  <dig> % confidence level, table  <dig>  the range of induction or suppression of this set of genes  was 6-fold induction and 5-fold suppression. twenty-nine of the  <dig> genes found by the above linear discriminant analysis were found in the list of  <dig> anova-qualified probes. an ontological clustering of the anova-p <dig> genes revealed patterns of proteases and protease inhibitors, cell-matrix adhesion genes, receptors, ion channels, various ligands including chemokines and interleukins, additional angiogenic genes and several genes of unknown function, tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the major ontological groups.

verification of selected genes by quantitative pcr analysis
the differential expression of selected genes was confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr using the same rna samples subjected to microarray hybridization. the vast majority of the genes tested by pcr validated the array analysis, fig.  <dig>  in some instances, discrepancies in fold-induction can be explained by methodological differences since the array data were all normalized to the co-hybridized universal-rna sample, while the pcr data were normalized to a β-actin probe . differential expression of angptl <dig>  gp <dig>  gnao <dig>  ccr <dig>  fgf <dig>  spp <dig> and col1a <dig> were qualitatively consistent in both the pcr and array analyses. however, two of the down-regulated genes identified by the array analysis, both g-protein coupled receptors, were found by pcr to be elevated, albeit with large variability; gpr <dig> was induced 281-fold sd =  <dig> and gpr <dig> induced 50-fold sd =  <dig>  of the two down-regulated genes examined by quantitative pcr, cd <dig> was consistent in both assays, while cd <dig> was measured by pcr as unchanged or minimally induced yet array analysis indicated cd <dig> was suppressed. however, the aggregate 2-fold cd <dig> induction as measured by quantitative pcr is the threshold of what is considered significantly distinguishable from unchanged. finally, while we did not perform pcr with species-specific probes for every gene present in the anova-p <dig> list, we were able to confirm differential expression of several human genes from mouse genes such as the osteopontin genes, fig.  <dig>  while this analysis does not rule out the possibility of partial contamination of the array results by some weak cross-hybridization, to guard against this possibility we carefully designed probes to be species-specific under the stringent hybridization conditions used in this study.

anova analysis of individual tumor types
to accommodate the possibility that tumor type was an important contributor to differential gene behavior, we performed a third analysis by examining the intersection between the differential genes of each individual tumor type. for this restrictive analysis, we simply examined each tumor type relative to its parental cell line by anova. approximately 91– <dig> genes were differentially expressed at  <dig> % confidence for each cell line: skov- <dig>   <dig> differential genes; mda,  <dig> differential genes; hct <dig>   <dig> differential genes; a <dig>   <dig> differential genes; and pc <dig>   <dig> differential genes . twelve genes were found in common amongst these separately analyzed tumor types, angplt <dig>  col1a <dig>  epithelial membrane protein  <dig> , gnao <dig>  glycoprotein  <dig> , gpr <dig>  has <dig>  hlaa, laminin beta  <dig> , pcdhb <dig>  protease inhibitor  <dig> , and ptger <dig>  table  <dig> 

comparison of multiple analyses
in a typical analysis of multivariate data, a particular method is often chosen as a filter for subsequent analyses. in this study, due to the high statistical reliability imparted by the high replicate probe count  enabled by the custom array design, we chose to compare the results of  <dig> different approaches to the intact dataset but modeled as either all data or individual tumor types. an estimate of the statistical significance of the overlap in differentially expressed genes common to the three analytical methods gave a pvalue of <  <dig> × 10- <dig> as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  as shown in fig.  <dig>  seven of the twelve differential genes found amongst individual tumor anova analyses were common to the linear discriminant gene profile : angplt <dig>  col1a <dig>  gp <dig>  gpr <dig>  lamb <dig>  pcdhb <dig>  and ptger <dig> 

real-time pcr analysis generally confirmed either induction or suppression in multiple tumor samples but with higher induction ratios; e.g. from fig.  <dig>  the level of angptl <dig> was measured by pcr as induced  <dig> to  <dig> fold with a average fold induction of  <dig> sd =  <dig> for  <dig> tumors . the aggregate induction of angptl <dig> in the array analysis was  <dig>  fold . similarly, col1a <dig> was measured by pcr as induced in most tumors with an average  <dig> -fold  versus a  <dig> -fold induction found by microarray analysis. finally, in ovarian and prostate tumors, angiopoietin  <dig>  measured by pcr was elevated 6-fold  versus the  <dig> -fold induction found by microarray analysis.

discussion
overall, the pathways represented by the differential genes in xenograft tumors support a model for late angiogenic expression patterns. in light of the collection of xenografts after 28– <dig> days post-implantation, is not surprising to find patterns of differential gene expression that reflect a portion of the tumorigenic process rather than a preponderance of early transforming events. this premise is largely supported by the abundance of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and angiopoetic genes common to the three analyses.

ten of the  <dig> induced genes identified by the anova of xenografts were either well-characterized functions or biological roles, particularly angiogenesis , morphogenesis . the role of extracellular matrix genes in tumor growth has been previously noted  <cit> . interestingly, five of the extracellular matrix genes from the linear discriminant analysis were collagens  and four of these collagens  have been previously found induced in primary renal cell carcinomas , and angpt <dig> induction .

other post-vegf angiogenic pathways
the role of other elevated angiogenic genes downstream of vegf bears discussion. the induction of the prostaglandin e receptor  <dig>  is of interest since prostaglandins can induce vegfa production  <cit>  via a hypoxia-induced pathway  <cit> . coincident with these observations, igfbp <dig> which was differential by anova and linear discriminant analysis, modulates igf mitogenic activity  <cit> . igfbp <dig> also stimulates prostacyclin synthesis  <cit>  perhaps to take advantage of our observed 6-fold increased ptger <dig> expression. similarly, a human-specific probe for tem <dig>  a marker of tumor endothelial angiogenesis  <cit> , was also found mildly increased  possibly as a result of vasculogenic mimicry  <cit> .

other factors such as fgf can play an angiogenic role. one fgf isoform was found significantly differential in some tumor combinations; fgf <dig> was elevated in colon and prostate xenograft tumors  respectively but 2-fold suppressed in ovarian tumors , fig.  <dig>  fgf <dig> was previously shown to stimulate the growth of endothelial cells of small but not large vessels in the rat cornea  <cit>  and hence supports the notion of vascular remodeling versus vasculogenesis. that differential expression of this gene was found only in some tumor combinations is consistent with the concept that each type of tumor will display individual differences in the balance angiogenic activators and inhibitors, yet the end physiological result, increased tumor vascularization, is the same  <cit> . finally, as noted above, genes that help destabilize or remodel vessels such as angpt <dig> and angptl <dig> were induced, consistent with an overall pattern of late-stage angiogenesis.

linking angiogenic pathways to neuropeptide signaling pathways
additional support for the late, post-vegf angiogenic pattern of gene expression in xenografts froms from the observed 5-fold induction of npy1r by both anova and linear discriminant analyses. npy1r has been reported to play a role downstream of vegf in vasoconstriction  <cit>  and capillary sprouting and differentiation  <cit> . consistent with the observation of npy1r induction, the potent effect of ligand neuropeptide  upon angiogenesis was shown to yield branching vasodilated structures distinct from those generated by vegf  <cit> . similarly, neuropeptide y has been reported to trigger angiogenesis via the npy <dig> receptor in ischemic muscle of mice  <cit> . interestingly, neuropilin  <dig>  which can act as a co-receptor with vegfr <dig>  <cit>  was found suppressed  while other vegf receptor levels were not significantly altered. finally, previous expression profile studies have found npy1r to be substantially induced in many breast, prostate and pancreatic carcinomas  <cit> .

additionally, two other differential genes involved in neuropeptide signaling were observed: melanocortin- <dig> receptor and sorcs3/neurotensin receptor gene. both mc2r and the sorcs <dig> were found differentially expressed by anova. mc2r is a gpcr that binds the acth peptide while sorcs <dig> is a homolog of the rat sortilin gene with vps <dig> domains characteristic to neuropeptide-binding proteins  <cit> . acth has been found to increase angiogenesis of cultured endothelial cells in a 3d-collagen assay  <cit>  and other neuropeptides have been implicated in stimulating vegf in prostate cancer cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we compared the expression profiles of secreted and cell surface genes from five different tissue sources. multiple tumors were derived from each parental cell line to examine the potential for tumor heterogeneity arising from the primary isolate, but we found relatively consistent behavior within any tumor group. however, we also found tumor-specific genes for each tumor type while identifying a profile of genes shared amongst all tumor types by multiple analytical approaches. overall, our results comprise a foundation of commonly regulated tumorigenic genes across tissues such as fundamental angiogenic inducers and regulators. given the diverse and complex expression behavior of primary human tumors from any single tissue source  <cit> , in the future it will be necessary to examine several established lines from many histologically similar primary tumors as well as different tumor types from the same tissue. similarly, it will be important to compare the effect of orthotopic implantation sites to the subcutaneous injection site in these preliminary studies. to resolve xenograft micro-heterogeneity, microarray analysis of micro-dissected xenograft or primary tumors can be used. micro-dissection will also allow the assessment of potential vasculogenic mimicry by aggressive tumor cells that can express endothelial genes  <cit> . additionally, the xenograft model can be more readily extended to monitor time-dependent expression profile changes in the development of tumors. such results can be used in combination or as a filter with other biomarker technologies such as tissue arrays  <cit>  or mass spectroscopy  <cit>  to fully characterize clinical specimens for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. by identifying genes known to participate in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis, our work establishes a baseline to evaluate and compare the full spectrum of gene profile changes in xenografts and clinical specimens. hence, time and tissue-specific gene and protein profiles may be useful for the discovery of both biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies.
