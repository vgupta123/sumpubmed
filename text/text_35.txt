BACKGROUND
the liver is the largest internal organ and provides many essential metabolic, exocrine and endocrine functions. the use of animal models including the mouse and primary cell cultures has identified many of the genes and pathways regulating embryonic liver development. these studies show that much of hepatogenesis is conserved throughout evolution. the liver, as well as the pancreas, develops from two unique spatial domains of the definitive endodermal epithelium of the embryonic foregut. fate-mapping experiments have shown that the liver arises from lateral domains of endoderm in the developing ventral foregut as well as from endodermal cells that track along the ventral midline  <cit> . during closure of the foregut, the medial and lateral domains come together as the hepatic endoderm is specified. the pancreas is also induced in lateral endodermal domains, adjacent and caudal to the lateral liver domains, as well as in cells near the dorsal midline of the foregut  <cit> . after the domains are specified and initiate morphogenetic budding, the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds merge to create the gland. these events occur at  <dig>  days of mouse gestation , corresponding to about  <dig> weeks of human gestation. despite differences in how the different progenitor domains are specified, descendants of both pancreatic progenitor domains make endocrine and exocrine cells, and descendants of both liver progenitor domains contribute to differentiating liver bud cells  <cit> .

newly specified hepatic cells in embryos are referred to as hepatoblasts which express albumin , transthyretin  and α-fetoprotein  at about the  <dig> somite  stage of mouse development . hepatoblasts are bipotential; those residing next to portal veins become bile epithelial cells that will line the lumen of the intrahepatic bile ducts while most of the hepatoblasts in the parenchyma differentiate into hepatocytes. the maturation of functional hepatocytes and the formation of a biliary network connected to the extrahepatic bile ducts are gradual, beginning at gd <dig> and continuing until after birth  <cit> .

between gd <dig>  and gd <dig> the liver bud undergoes substantial growth and becomes the major site of fetal hematopoiesis. erythrocytes are required for survival and growth of the mammalian embryo beyond early post-implantation stages of development. the embryo's first "primitive" erythroid cells, derived from a transient wave of committed progenitors, emerge from the yolk sac as immature precursors and differentiate as a semisynchronous cohort in the bloodstream  <cit> . the yolk sac also synthesizes a second transient wave of "definitive" erythroid progenitors that enter the bloodstream and seed the fetal liver. simultaneously, hematopoietic stem cells within the embryo also seed the liver and are the presumed source of long-term erythroid potential. fetal-definitive erythroid precursors mature in macrophage islands within the liver, enucleate, and enter the bloodstream as erythrocytes. toward the end of gestation, definitive erythropoiesis shifts to its final location, the bone marrow  <cit> .

fetuses and neonates are generally considered more susceptible to xenobiotics than adults  <cit> . pharmacokinetic differences in the fetus, newborns and children may alter responses to environmental chemicals compared to adults, potentially resulting in a different spectrum of susceptibility to adverse health effects. detoxification and elimination of xenobiotics is a major function of the liver and is important in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of the organism. xenobiotics are metabolized by a large number of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and transporters which fall into three broad categories: phase i, phase ii and transporters. phase i enzymes are involved in oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis, and include cytochrome p <dig> family members. phase ii enzymes convert the products of phase i metabolism into amphiphilic anionic conjugates that are water soluble and include glutathione transferases, udp-glucuronyl transferases, and sulfotransferases. phase iii transporters export conjugated xenobiotics out of the liver and include atp binding cassette subfamily members, organic anion and cation transporters, and solute carriers  <cit> . a large number of genetic and biochemical studies have shown that the level of expression and activity of individual xmes in part determines the fate of a specific xenobiotic and whether exposure results in toxicity  <cit> . a comprehensive understanding of the differences between fetal and neonatal xme gene expression with that in the adult would be useful to predict classes of chemicals to which these life stages may exhibit altered responses.

liver gene expression during development has been examined previously. jochheim et al.  <cit>  studied gene expression profiles in gd <dig> , gd <dig> , and gd <dig>  balb/c mice using microarrays of ~ <dig>  genes. the greatest number of differentially regulated genes  was found in gd <dig>  versus adult liver, and the lowest number was found in gd <dig>  versus gd <dig>    <cit> . gene expression changes were observed for a number of genes known to be involved in liver development, including afp, alb, c/ebp alpha, c/ebp beta, gata- <dig> and hex. jochheim-richter et al.  <cit>  subsequently performed a cluster analysis of livers from gd <dig> , gd <dig> , and gd <dig>  balb/c mice. one hundred and thirty genes were continuously expressed at all stages of development with peak expression of  <dig> genes at gd <dig> . li et al.  <cit>  studied gene expression and transcriptional regulation at  <dig> time points across the c57/b <dig> mouse liver development, from gd <dig>  to adult. cell-cycle-related genes were highly expressed in early embryo development, defense-related genes were activated around birth, and liver-function-related transcription factors and genes were highly activated in the later stage of development  <cit> .

using full-genome arrays, we determined the transcriptional ontogeny of the developing liver from gd <dig>  to the adult. we examined the expression of genes important in liver differentiation, hematopoiesis, and xenobiotic metabolism. although liver gene expression during development has been examined previously, as described above, we employed a number of strategies to provide insights into the function of the genes identified including comparing the liver profiles to the profiles generated from at least  <dig> different mouse tissues and to those profiles that were derived from different types of blood cells. in addition, we describe in greater detail the relationships between the changes in those genes involved in chemical metabolism and transport and possible phenotypic effects of chemical exposure.

methods
animals and study design
study 1- samples for microarray
in study  <dig>  timed-pregnant c57bl/6j dams were purchased from charles river laboratory  and acclimated for  <dig> week. mice were housed  in polycarbonate cages on alpha-dri bedding . animal facilities were controlled for temperature  and relative humidity , and kept under a 12-h light-dark cycle. the basal diet was pellet chow  and tap water was provided ad libitum. pregnant dams were sacrificed at gestational day   <dig> and male pups were sacrificed by decapitation. mice from additional litters at ages pnd <dig>  pnd <dig>  and pnd <dig> were sacrificed using co <dig> asphyxiation. only male mice were used in this study. livers were removed, weighed and sections from the left and median lobes were fixed in formalin, embedded, sectioned, and stained with h&e. the remainder of the liver was cubed and stored at -80°c until rna isolation.

study 2- samples for real-time rt-pcr
rna samples used for real-time rt-pcr were obtained from another study run by a collaborating author. in study  <dig>  timed pregnant cd- <dig> mice were obtained from charles river laboratories , where females were bred overnight, and the sperm positive females were designated gd <dig>  pregnant mice were shipped to epa on gd <dig> and upon arrival were housed individually in polypropylene cages with alpha-dri  bedding and provided pellet chow  and tap water ad libitum. animal facility conditions were the same as in study  <dig>  pregnant mice were killed on gd <dig> and gd <dig> for collection of adult and fetal livers. fetal livers were pooled by litter because these tissues were small and determination of sex of the fetuses was not feasible, as it would have required extensive additional work. remaining dams were allowed to deliver pups and tissues were collected from pups on pnd  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  since fetal livers were pooled, with male and female expected to be represented equally for each litter, a decision was made to also pool the postnatal livers with one male and one female per litter combined for rna preparation. all litters were weaned on postnatal day   <dig> at which time liver was also collected from the dams. at collection, livers were frozen in rna-later  at -80°c until rna isolation.

all animal studies were conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the u.s. epa ord/nheerl institutional animal care and use committee. procedures and facilities were consistent with the recommendations of the  <dig> nrc "guide for the care and use of laboratory animals", the animal welfare act, and public health service policy on the humane care and use of laboratory animals.

rna isolation
total rna was isolated from mouse livers using tri reagent  according to the manufacturer's directions, and further purified using the qiagen rneasy mini rna cleanup protocol . rna pellets were stored in 70% ethanol at -80°c until further use. the integrity of each rna sample was determined using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer , and rna quantity was determined using a nanodrop® nd- <dig> .

microarray hybridizations
liver gene expression analysis was performed according to the affymetrix recommended protocol using affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  genechips® containing probes for over  <dig>  well-characterized genes. total rna  was labeled using the affymetrix® one-cycle cdna synthesis protocol and hybridized to arrays as described by the manufacturer . microarray hybridizations were conducted overnight at 45°c while rotating in an affymetrix hybridization oven. after  <dig> hours of hybridization, the cocktail was removed and the arrays were washed and stained in an affymetrix genechip® fluidics station  <dig> according to the affymetrix-recommended protocol. arrays were scanned on an affymetrix genechip® scanner. four mice per age group  were examined.

analyses of microarray data
all affymetrix  .cel files were first analyzed by bioconductor's simpleaffy package to assess data quality  <cit> . all .cel files passed this qc step. data  were background corrected and statistically filtered using rosetta resolver® version  <dig>  software . the background correction was done by resolver's specific data processing pipeline . statistically significant genes were identified using one-way anova with a false discovery rate  of ≤  <dig>  followed by a post-hoc test  for significance. hierarchical clustering was performed using cluster and visualized with treeview  <cit> . a detailed description of the microarray experiment is available through gene expression omnibus at the national center for biotechnology information at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/, as accession number gse <dig> 

reanalysis of published microarray data
the raw data files analyzed in this project  were downloaded from gene expression omnibus . all of the .cel files were analyzed as described above. a detailed description of each experiment is available through gene expression omnibus at the national center for biotechnology information at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.

to create a broader view of gene expression changes during development, we combined our dataset from the gd <dig> - pnd <dig> male c57bl/ <dig> mice with a dataset from cd- <dig> mice at gd <dig> , gd <dig> , gd <dig> , gd <dig>  and gd <dig>  in which 10-week-old females were used as controls . given differences in the experiments, we used distance weighted discrimination   <cit>  to minimize systematic microarray data biases attributable to rna source, different analysis laboratories, different microarrays, or other systematic differences which include sex and strain in this case. dwd applies singular value decomposition amended with fisher linear discrimination to find better corrections for systematic effect adjustments. these adjustments were applied to preserve variation not caused by systematic effects. based on evaluation of affymetrix spike-in controls, the samples from the two experiments exhibited similar behavior by pca after the procedures were applied . the resulting merged dataset was used for global analysis of fetal and neonatal expression as well as the analysis of pancreas-specific genes, hematopoietic-specific genes and xenobiotic metabolism genes. in this merged dataset, the fetal and neonatal samples were normalized to the adult samples from the two studies. the data was also analyzed by tightcluster, a resampling-based approach for identifying stable and tight patterns in data  <cit> . we used only the gd <dig> - pnd <dig> dataset generated from male c57bl/6j mice  to perform the analysis of the time course of pancreas-specific genes. in this case the dwd was not applied, but rather we used the rosetta resolver procedures as detailed above. the fetal  and neonatal  samples were compared to the pnd <dig> adult samples.

genes were divided into those that were up- or down-regulated and were analyzed separately for enrichment of canonical and toxicity pathways using ingenuity pathway analysis . pathways that did not meet the p-value significance  were excluded. p-values were converted to -log. for those significant pathways derived from down-regulated genes all -logs were converted to negative numbers. all data was clustered and visualized as described above using cluster and treeview.

the microarray data from the liver samples were compared to a database of >  <dig> other mouse tissues . comparisons were made in rosetta resolver using pca of all tissues and hierarchical clustering comparing the liver and pancreas samples. tissue-specific signature genes were generated from this dataset by identifying those genes which exhibited differential expression between either 1) the top  <dig> adult pancreas genes , 2) the top  <dig> fetal liver genes , or 3) the top  <dig> bone marrow genes  and all other tissues in the dataset.

human samples were derived from the following arrayexpress submissions: e-tabm- <dig>  e-afmx- <dig>  e-mtab- <dig>  and e-mtab- <dig>  they included  <dig> fetal livers,  <dig> adult livers and  <dig> adult pancreases. hierarchical clustering was performed in rosetta resolver. mouse-human comparisons of canonical pathways were made using ipa as described above. genes were divided into those 1) expressed in fetal liver only, 2) common to pancreas and fetal liver with the fetal liver fold-change values and 3) in pancreas only. these  <dig> groups were analyzed using ipa before and after separation into up- and down-regulated genes. the same canonical pathways were compared between mice and humans.

we examined the expression of genes identified as signature genes for purified erythropoeitic cells including natural killer  cells, t cells, b cells, monocytes, neutrophils, nucleated erythrocytes, and activated and naive cd4+  and cd8+  t cell subsets . the signature genes were derived from the chambers et al.  <cit>  study.

evaluation of selected genes by real-time rt-pcr
expression of  <dig> genes  was confirmed using the tissues from study  <dig> by quantitative rt-pcr, validating our microarray analysis procedures. quantitative rt-pcr was performed on rna from the eight age groups  in study  <dig> . eighty-five nanograms of total rna were loaded into each one-step qrt-pcr reaction containing 1x quantitect™ probe rt-pcr master mix  and  <dig> × taqman® gene expression assays  for the desired gene target. we examined the expression of two housekeeping genes  throughout development and showed that expression changed significantly with greatest expression for both genes between gd <dig> and gd <dig>  indicating that these genes were not appropriate normalization controls . therefore, a relative standard curve was generated for each target using serially diluted rna pooled from the study. relative quantities were calculated from the appropriate relative standard curve. relative quantities were then compared among treatment groups. statistical significance was determined using tukey-kramer hsd.

in situ hybridization
embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. sections were cut, deparaffinized, treated with proteinase k  for  <dig> minutes, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and acetylated with triethanolamine buffer  containing  <dig> % acetic anhydride for  <dig> minutes. after rinsing, slides were hybridized with antisense and sense dig-labeled rna probes. probes were 600-700bp pcr products amplified from embryonic liver cdna libraries using gene specific primers. gel-purified pcr products were subcloned and labeled using a dig rna-labeling mix . slides were hybridized with labeled sense and anti-sense probes in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1x denhardt's solution, 200ug/ml trna, 10mm tris ph  <dig> , 600mm nacl, 1mm edta,  <dig> % sds in a humidified chamber overnight at  <dig> degrees c. slides were washed in 5x ssc, 2x ssc and  <dig> x ssc at  <dig> degrees c. dig was detected with an alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody  and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate toludidine salt.

RESULTS
transcriptional ontogeny of the developing mouse liver
gene expression was measured in the livers from fetuses   <dig> -19) and neonates   <dig> and 30) and compared to that in adult livers. marker genes for the fetal liver were examined for predicted expression behavior. fetal liver-specific genes which exhibited significant differences  between fetal liver and ~ <dig> other mouse tissues were initially examined for changes. figure 1a shows a subset of the genes which exhibited increased expression in the fetal liver compared to the adult. the genes included alpha fetoprotein , widely recognized as a fetal liver protein  <cit> , a number of fetal hemoglobin genes  and alpha-2-macroglobulin , known to be expressed in the fetal liver  <cit> . genes not previously associated with fetal expression were also identified including stefin family members  containing cysteine protease inhibitor domains, hypoxia inducible factor  <dig>  alpha subunit  and the zinc transporter solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig> . the fetal expression of afp and a2m  and slc39a <dig>  was confirmed by rt-pcr using an independent set of livers from fetal and neonatal mice. genes that were down-regulated specifically in the fetal liver were also identified . expression of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligase makorin  and a regulator of splicing, regulator of differentiation  <dig>  was examined by in situ hybridization . by microarray, both genes exhibited maximal expression at gd <dig>  . expression of the genes in the liver by ish could be detected as early as gd <dig>  through gd <dig>  . thus, the microarray results were consistent with the analysis of rna expression by other methods.

transcriptional ontogeny of the developing liver was characterized by examining the expression of all genes that exhibited changes during development . approximately  <dig> genes exhibited altered expression in at least one of the time points. a greater number of genes were under-expressed than over-expressed relative to the adults. the gene expression differences were most striking between gd <dig> - <dig> . petkov et al.  <cit>  also found the gene expression of fetal hepatoblasts to differ profoundly from that of adult hepatocytes, with a major switch at gd <dig> to  <dig>  gd <dig>  pnd <dig> and pnd <dig> time points exhibited progressively fewer genes and in general, smaller fold-change differences compared to the adult animals. while many genes exhibited striking differences throughout all or most periods of development, groups of genes were identified that were altered only during discrete windows of development . four major groups were identified including  <dig> genes whose maximal expression was between gd <dig>  and gd <dig>  ,  <dig> genes whose maximal expression was between gd <dig>  and gd <dig>  ,  <dig> genes which exhibited sustained and approximately uniform expression throughout development  and  <dig> genes which exhibited maximal expression in the adult .

genes expressed early in development included those expressed in embryonic stem  cells and are involved in tissue development including mdk, ptn, hmga <dig>  ndn, and pa2g <dig>  midkine  and the related cytokine pleiotrophin/heparin-binding growth-associated molecule  are essential for normal development of the catecholamine and renin-angiotensin pathways. mdk regulates ptn expression  <cit> , and ptn may be secreted from embryonic mesenchymal cells as a mitogen of parenchymal cells in the embryonic liver  <cit> . the high mobility group at-hook  <dig> gene , abundant in es cells is involved in transcriptional activation of cell proliferation genes, substantially contributing to the plasticity of es cell chromatin and maintenance of an undifferentiated cell state  <cit> . necdin  preferentially expressed in primitive stem cells, is an important protein in hematopoietic stem cell regulation  <cit> . proliferation-associated 2g <dig>  is expressed in mouse es cells  <cit> . the entire list of genes which exhibited expression during discrete windows of development is found in additional file  <dig> 

to categorize the pathways altered during liver development, ingenuity pathways analysis  was used to identify the canonical pathways that were significantly altered during development. in the first analysis, the four sets of genes which exhibited discrete windows of expression were examined . the canonical pathways that were significantly altered were, for the most part, unique for the early, middle or late time periods of development. pathways altered late in the adult were those associated with functions of the mature liver including intermediary metabolism, whereas almost all of the pathways altered in the fetus were associated with signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, active during the growth of the liver bud.

to assess the impact of liver development on putative pathway activation or suppression, ipa was again used to identify pathways significantly altered at each time point in development using those genes described in figure 1d. the genes at each time point were separated into those that were up- or down-regulated relative to the adult and were analyzed separately as detailed in the materials and methods. pathways regulated in the fetus were dominated by those that were less active than in the adult including those involved in intermediary and xenobiotic metabolism, whereas putative activated pathways were dominated by those involved in cell proliferation and cell signaling . activated pathways were associated with dna replication fidelity during the cell cycle  . li et al.  <cit>  also found that in early embryo development, cell-cycle-related genes were highly expressed and defense-related genes were activated around birth. pathways with well-known effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis were significantly regulated including those under control of 14-3- <dig> regulatory proteins, p <dig>  polo-like kinase, btg family members, brca <dig>  atm, and oct <dig> . a number of liver toxicity pathways were also significantly modified including increases in liver hematopoiesis  and hemorrhaging and down-regulation of liver cholestasis associated with bile acid homeostasis . an examination of pathways involved in xenobiotic and intermediary metabolism  showed that while most pathways were suppressed during development, nine were up-regulated, the most prominent of those being purine and pyrimidine metabolism, likely activated to support dna and rna synthesis during active liver growth .

this analysis highlights the dramatic changes the fetal liver undergoes during development. we identified key pathways that support the growth and function of the developing liver. these gene expression and pathway changes will be a useful resource for hypothesis generation and testing of the role of genes, pathways and genetic networks in liver development.

transcriptional similarities between the developing liver and the pancreas
given that hematopoiesis is carried out in the fetal liver  <cit> , the extent of the transcriptional similarities were determined between the developing liver and other tissues including those involved in hematopoiesis in the adult mouse. we performed an unsupervised comparison by principal components analysis  between the developing liver and a database of >  <dig> other mouse tissues which included many involved in hematopoiesis. the fetal and neonatal samples progressed along a trajectory from embryonic stem cells  to the adult liver . in contrast to the prediction of similarity to hematopoietic tissues, gd <dig> samples were more similar to the pancreas from gd <dig>  and pnd <dig> mice than to other tissues. hierarchical clustering of the liver and pancreas samples showed that the fetal liver exhibited greater similarity to the pancreas than neonatal and adult liver . a direct comparison of the genes altered between the fetal vs. adult livers and the adult pancreas vs. the adult liver demonstrated the impressive overlap in gene expression . the concordance of the overlapping genes was striking both in direction of change and intensity of the differences . pancreas-specific genes  were identified as detailed in the materials and methods and examined for expression changes throughout development . the genes included many that were up-regulated and not previously associated with the fetal liver. the pancreas-specific genes that were expressed in the fetal liver did not include those that are islet-specific , insulin i , insulin ii , and regenerating islet-derived genes ).

to determine the prevalence of expression of pancreas-related genes in the late term fetus and in the neonate, we examined expression in the livers from male mice at gd <dig>  pnd <dig>  pnd <dig> compared to pnd <dig>  many of the up-regulated genes exhibited sustained expression through pnd <dig> including reep <dig>  spink <dig> and slc39a <dig> . in contrast, many genes encoding digestive enzymes secreted by pancreatic acinar cells were down-regulated in the fetal and neonatal livers including carboxypeptidase a <dig>  pancreatic , elastase  <dig>  pancreatic , carboxypeptidase b <dig>  , and colipase, pancreatic .

expression of four pancreas-specific genes  was examined by rt-pcr . reep <dig>  slc39a <dig> and spink <dig> exhibited peak expression between gd <dig> and gd <dig> whereas hamp <dig> was suppressed until pnd <dig>  none of these genes appear to have been previously associated with expression in the fetal liver, whereas there is ample evidence for expression in the fetal or adult pancreas. hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  is responsive to dietary iron, indicating a role for hamp <dig> in the regulation of iron homeostasis  <cit> . hamp <dig> expression is sex-dependent, with higher expression in female mouse livers  <cit> , consistent with the higher expression in the maternal liver than in the adult male liver . receptor accessory protein  <dig> , also known as deleted in polyposis  <dig> , is an integral membrane protein that may be involved in shaping the tubular er  <cit> . solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig>   belongs to a subfamily of proteins that show structural characteristics of zinc transporters. slc39a <dig> expression is restricted to many tissues important for zinc homeostasis, including the intestine, pancreas, liver and kidney and localizes to the basolateral surfaces of pancreas acinar and intestinal enterocyte cells in mice fed a zinc-adequate diet. this protein is removed from these cell surfaces and internalized during dietary zinc deficiency, indicating that slc39a <dig> functions to remove zinc from the blood via the pancreas and intestine, the major sites of zinc excretion in mammals  <cit> . the serine peptidase inhibitor, kazal type  <dig> , is a trypsin inhibitor, secreted from pancreatic acinar cells into pancreatic juice. spink <dig> can be detected in the pancreas at gd <dig> , before formation of the typical shape of the exocrine structure of the pancreas; acinar cell expression is clearly identified by gd <dig>   <cit> . spink <dig> protein may function to prevent trypsin-catalyzed premature activation of zymogens within the pancreas and the pancreatic duct. mutations in this gene are associated with hereditary pancreatitis. in spink3-null mice, the pancreas develops normally up to gd <dig> , and starting at gd <dig> , there is evidence of autophagic degeneration of acinar cells, but not ductal or islet cells, indicating that spink <dig> has essential roles in the integrity of pancreatic acinar cells  <cit> . spink <dig> is induced in the pancreas after pancreatic injury and its up-regulation may reflect an important endogenous cytoprotective mechanism to prevent further injury  <cit> . both spink <dig> and reep <dig> are enriched in pancreatic cells over-expressing the pancreatic transcription factor gene pancreatic-duodenal homeobox  <dig>   <cit> . additional genes known to be expressed in the pancreas and identified in our study included pdia <dig> also known as protein disulfide isomerase  like  <cit> , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig>    <cit>  and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase   <cit> .

to determine if the human fetal liver also exhibits a pancreas-like signature, a number of human samples were examined from an archived tissue set . the three fetal liver samples exhibited greater similarity with five adult pancreas samples than with the majority of the adult liver samples. similar to the mouse results, a direct comparison of the genes which were altered between the fetal vs. adult livers and the adult pancreas vs. the adult liver also showed extensive overlap in humans , including concordance of the overlapping genes in direction of change and intensity of the differences .

we next asked whether the pancreas-related genes found in the fetal liver exhibited functional overlap in mice and humans. ipa was used to identify the canonical pathways that were overrepresented by the  <dig> groups of genes in mice and humans identified in figures 3c and 4b, respectively. the pathways altered in each species were then compared directly. a number of pathways exhibited similar representation in both mice and humans. the greatest overlap in the up-regulated pathways included those involved in cell proliferation . these pathways were significantly altered in the fetal liver only, as well as the common genes in both species. in humans and to a lesser extent mice, these pathways were more significant in the fetal liver as expected given the higher level of cell proliferation compared to the adult pancreas. the greatest overlap in the down-regulated pathways included those involved in lipid and steroid homeostasis, and stress responses . these pathways were generally altered in common and pancreas-only gene sets in both species.

these results indicate that the developing liver in mice and humans exhibits transcriptional features similar to the adult pancreas. the fact that genes related to pancreas function are expressed in the neonatal liver is intriguing and prompts the question of whether there is a functional significance to the overlap in the expression of pancreas-specific genes in the neonate. the expression of the pancreas-specific genes in the fetus and neonate does not include those genes encoding pancreatic digestive enzymes from the acinar cells or those associated with the islet cells. thus, the analysis indicates that the fetal and to a lesser extent the neonatal liver exhibits some transcriptional features of the adult pancreas which may reflect the common embryonic origins of these tissues but not necessarily the inherent functions of the pancreas.

identification of a nucleated erythrocyte-specific gene expression signature in the developing liver
the developing liver is a major source of fetal hematopoiesis. a comprehensive identification of liver versus hematopoietic-specific genes during development would be useful to dissect transient or sustained roles for genes in mediating chemical induced effects in the fetal liver. we focused on distinguishing between gene expression changes due to the resident cells of the liver and hematopoietic cells that are transiently present in the fetal liver. given that many types of blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, adult bone marrow-specific genes  were first identified and then examined for expression changes in the developing liver . these genes uniformly exhibited increased expression compared to adult mice that peaked between gd <dig>  and gd <dig> . only a handful of these genes retained elevated expression past gd <dig>  consistent with hematopoietic stem cells migrating from the liver to populate other tissues after birth. many of the genes possess functions associated with erythrocytes including heme biosynthesis and iron transport .

the individual signatures of specific blood cell types in the fetal liver were examined using marker genes for  <dig> different blood cell types or categories  <cit> . out of the  <dig> signature genes for the different blood cell types, a total of  <dig> genes overlapped with those regulated in the fetal liver. the genes were enriched for nucleated erythrocytes  whereas all other cell types except hematopoietic stem cells had less than expected numbers of genes . most of the nucleated erythrocyte signature genes exhibited increased expression compared to adult controls  whereas the hematopoietic stem cell signature genes and genes for other cell types  were dominated by down-regulated genes.

the expression of four genes  identified as bone-marrow or nucleated erythrocyte-specific were confirmed by rt-pcr. all four genes exhibited similar changes during development that were different from the pancreas-specific genes with peak expression at the earliest measured time  and decreasing expression until pnd <dig>  at which time expression was low or not detectable . gata binding protein  <dig>  is a transcription factor that plays an important role in erythroid development by regulating the switch of fetal hemoglobin to adult hemoglobin. the kruppel-like factor  <dig>   encodes a hematopoietic-specific transcription factor that induces high-level expression of adult beta-globin and other erythroid genes. aminolevulinic acid synthase  <dig>  erythroid  specifies an erythroid-specific mitochondrially located enzyme. the encoded protein catalyzes the first step in the heme biosynthetic pathway. drug-induced hemolytic anemia can be detected based on hepatic changes in the expression of genes including alas <dig> that are mechanistically linked to hematotoxicity  <cit> . the erythropoietin receptor  is a member of the cytokine receptor family. upon erythropoietin binding, epor activates a kinase-mediated cascade culminating in the activation of erythrocyte-specific transcription factors including gata <dig>  <cit> . a functional epor is likely necessary and sufficient for thrombopoietin to exert its mitogenic effects on erythroid cells  <cit>  and appears to have a role in erythroid cell survival  <cit> . epor with common beta receptor  comprise a tissue-protective heteroreceptor that mediates the tissue-protective effects of erythropoietin in preclinical models of ischemic, traumatic, toxic, and inflammatory injuries  <cit> .

the results demonstrate that signature genes for nucleated erythrocytes can be identified within the developing liver and indicate that nucleated erythrocytes exhibit the dominant hematopoietic cell transcriptional signature in the developing liver. gene and protein expression analysis of a more limited set of tissues during mouse liver development also uncovered features of hematopoiesis in the developing liver  <cit> , and in general their findings are consistent with ours. however, the results from our study indicated that many markers for hematopoiesis were elevated past the latest time point in the guo et al. study . li et al.  <cit>  also examined gene expression at  <dig> time points across the c57/b <dig> mouse liver development, and found the gene expression of markers for hematopoiesis peaked from gd <dig>  to gd <dig>  and then decreased at gd <dig>  and older. our studies provide a foundation on which to examine the effects of different genetic and environmental effects on these genes and their down-stream consequences.

impact of development on xenobiotic metabolism gene expression
the fetus and neonate are considered potentially sensitive populations to the adverse effects of environmentally relevant chemicals. we were interested, therefore, in characterizing the expression of genes that impact xenobiotic metabolism which may allow follow-on predictions of chemicals to which the fetus or the neonate may be particularly sensitive  <cit> . we examined canonical pathways involved in xenobiotic metabolism including those controlled by nuclear receptors. most pathways were down-regulated throughout development . aryl hydrocarbon receptor  signaling was represented by both up- and down-regulated genes, possibly due to the dual role of ahr in liver vascularization during development and xenobiotic metabolism in the adult liver in different cell types  <cit> .

the xenobiotic metabolism genes were separated into phase i cytochrome p <dig> cyp genes, phase ii conjugation enzymes and phase iii transporter genes. remarkably, all cyp genes  and most phase ii genes  were under expressed relative to the adult animals. only the phase ii genes, mgst <dig> and gstm <dig>  exhibited increased expression through development. under expressed genes exhibited discrete times at which they achieved adult expression levels with a few genes achieving adult levels as early as gd <dig>  . most genes achieved adult expression levels after gd <dig> . however, even at pnd <dig>  the expression of many genes was lower than those in adults.

while genes involved in transport were generally under expressed during development, there were  <dig> genes which exhibited increased expression. expression of a number of these phase iii genes overlapped with the signature genes for nucleated erythrocytes   <cit>  or pancreas  . transporters with increased fetal expression included genes with known endogenous functions such as transport of amino acids , adenine nucleotide , glucose , heme , inorganic anion ), inorganic phosphate , monocarboxylic acids such as lactate , urea , and zinc . the expression changes for ~ <dig> xenobiotic metabolizing genes in phase i, ii and iii at gd19-pnd <dig> were confirmed and are published elsewhere  <cit> .

a number of the phase iii genes that are coordinately up-regulated during development may have essential roles in liver growth. the amino acid transporters slc1a <dig>  slc7a <dig> and slc3a <dig> play roles in regulating the target of rapamycin complex  <dig> , a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that in mammals activates cell growth in response to stimuli including nutrients , growth factors , and cellular energy status . inhibition of torc <dig> activates autophagy  <cit> . the mammalian target of rapamycin  canonical pathway was significantly altered during early  and mid  expression periods of liver growth . l-glutamine uptake is regulated by slc1a <dig> and loss of slc1a <dig> function inhibits cell growth and activates autophagy. the complex of slc7a5/slc3a <dig>  acts as a bidirectional transporter that regulates the simultaneous efflux of l-glutamine out of cells and transport of l-leucine/essential amino acids into cells. thus, l-glutamine flux regulates mtor to coordinate cell growth and proliferation  <cit> . in addition to the role of slc1a5/slc7a5/slc3a <dig> in liver growth, other slc family members that were up-regulated during development may also have roles. immunomodulatory compounds that inhibit human and rat t lymphocyte proliferation act by inhibiting slc16a <dig>  <cit> . the essential role of slc20a <dig> in liver development was determined in slc20a1-null mice which displayed decreased proliferation, extensive apoptosis in the liver and embryonic lethality at gd <dig>   <cit> , the time of earliest expression changes observed by microarray .

to begin to address the basis for the low level of expression observed for many xenobiotic metabolism genes, the expression of transcription factors that are known to mediate chemical-inducible gene expression was examined. many of the nuclear receptors are targets of chemicals and drugs. a subset of nuclear receptors exhibited decreased expression compared to pnd <dig> animals . the expression of components of the dioxin receptor  and nfe2l <dig>  also known as nrf <dig>   did not exhibit changes throughout development. we hypothesize that the expression of xenobiotic metabolism genes is reduced relative to the adult due to lower expression of the factors that control their basal transcription levels. one such factor could be the nuclear receptor hnf4a which controls the expression of a large number of liver-specific genes  <cit> . like our microarray results, li et al.  <cit>  observed an increase in the expression profile of hnf4a during mouse liver development, with enhanced expression occurring at postnatal stages.

our comprehensive analysis of xme expression adds to the current body of knowledge which indicates that development affects the hepatic expression of xmes in mice and rats. a comparative expression profiling of  <dig> mouse cytochrome p <dig> genes in gd <dig>  gd <dig>  gd <dig>  and gd <dig> swiss weber/nih embryos was conducted using multiple tissue clontech cdna panel mouse i  <cit> . twenty-seven p450s were expressed during development with numbers gradually increasing throughout development. cyp2s <dig>  cyp8a <dig>  cyp <dig>  cyp21a <dig>  cyp26a <dig>  cyp <dig>  and cyp <dig> were detected at all stages. in rats, there is a 4- and 6- fold increase in cyp content at postnatal days  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, compared with day  <dig> of birth  <cit> . cyp1a <dig> is expressed during early gestation, but expression of most of the other cyp enzymes occurs at or near birth  or immediately after birth   <cit> . cyp1a <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  cyp2c <dig>  and cyp4a <dig> are expressed after the first week of birth 
 <cit> . cyp2b <dig> activity at pnd <dig> is comparable to levels observed in adult livers  <cit> , whereas postnatal  <cit>  activity of cyp2e <dig> increases linearly with age and at pnd <dig> is comparable to that in adult liver  <cit> . in humans, total cytochrome p <dig> content in the fetal liver is between 30% and 60% of that found in the adult and approaches adult values by  <dig> years of age  <cit> . cyp3a <dig> activity is high immediately after birth; during the first days after birth there is a shift from mainly cyp3a <dig> activity to cyp3a <dig> activity  <cit> . cyp2d <dig> and cyp2e <dig> activities are minimal in the fetal liver but quickly increase hours after birth  <cit> . sonnier et al. reported delayed ontogenesis of cyp1a <dig> in the human liver  <cit> .

in summary, analysis of xenobiotic metabolism genes indicates that there are profound differences in their expression compared to the young adult. while there are a number of genes that exhibit increased expression compared to the adult, the vast majority of genes exhibit decreased levels. these decreases could potentially result in prolonged chemical effects including toxicity in the fetus due to inability to metabolize and excrete xenobiotics. predictions of chemical sensitivities can be made by identifying chemicals that interact with individual xmes. this would include xmes involved in the metabolism of a chemical whose expression is decreased during early life stages. however, depending on the chemical, there may be cases where decreased expression of a cyp may be protective of the fetus. for example, cyp1a <dig> metabolically activates aflatoxin b <dig> to its carcinogenic metabolite  <cit> . future work will be directed towards determining the chemicals to which the fetus and the neonate may exhibit altered responses and will depend in part on accounting for the effects of tissues that act as a metabolic barrier to environmental exposure to protect the embryo  and the fetus .

CONCLUSIONS
our microarray analysis demonstrates that the fetal liver undergoes dramatic transcriptional changes during development and maturation. we identified key pathways that support the growth and function of the developing liver. signature genes for erythropoiesis were identified and indicate that nucleated erythrocytes exhibit the dominant hematopoietic cell transcriptional signature in the developing liver. our results also indicate that the developing liver exhibits transcriptional features similar to the adult pancreas, which may reflect the common embryonic origins of these tissues. the vast majority of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and transport exhibit decreased expression compared to the adult which may alter susceptibility to environmental chemicals in the fetus and neonate. our analysis also emphasizes that microarray datasets can be successfully combined to create a broader view of gene expression changes during development.
