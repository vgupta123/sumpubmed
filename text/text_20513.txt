BACKGROUND
normal metazoan development occurs through the correct activation of different signalling pathways leading in turn to the temporally precise activation of transcriptional networks  <cit> . one such pathway with a fundamental and conserved role in early vertebrate development is the nodal signalling pathway. nodal signalling acts through ligand-mediated receptor activation of the transcription factors smad2/ <dig>  on pathway activation these factors translocate to the nucleus where they interact with other transcription factors at genomic cis-regulatory elements to modulate target gene expression  <cit> , leading to induction of mesoderm and endoderm, ventral neural tube formation and establishment of bilateral asymmetry  <cit> . the importance of this pathway in early development is seen in loss of nodal signalling mutants in mouse and zebrafish, which display perturbed mesoderm, endoderm and ventral neural tube formation . similarly, in xenopus, knockdown of nodal signalling or dominant-negative interference with the pathway leads to inhibition of mesoderm and endoderm formation . equally, overexpression of nodal signalling pathway components leads to upregulation of mesodermal and endodermal markers in zebrafish and xenopus  <cit> . despite this, the extent to which the transcriptional networks directed by smad <dig> are evolutionarily maintained has not been determined.

in order to understand the transcriptional networks driven by nodal signalling it is also necessary to unravel the functional relationship between smad2/ <dig> and their interacting factors. since the initial identification of foxh <dig> as a smad-interacting transcription factor  <cit>  several other transcription factors that interact with smad <dig> in different systems have been identified, including e2a, heb, oct <dig> and eomesodermin  <cit> .

eomesodermin is a t-box transcription factor expressed during early vertebrate development. it is critical for endoderm and cardiac mesoderm formation in mouse embryo  <cit> , necessary and sufficient for mesoderm induction in xenopus  <cit>  and in differentiated human embryonic stem cells  it has also been shown to act with smad2/ <dig> in the specification of endoderm  <cit> .

in zebrafish there are two eomesodermin homologues, eomesa and eomesb  <cit> , with eomesa being a maternally contributed factor that is not spatially restricted in early development  <cit> . overexpression of eomesa leads to induction of dorsal mesodermal markers and, in conjunction with gata <dig> and bon, eomesa directly induces sox <dig>  a key endodermal determinant  <cit> . on the other hand, mzeomesa null mutant embryos exhibit only reduced early expression of endoderm markers and moderate lethality by 24 hours post fertilization  <cit> , indicating that although eomesa is sufficient for induction of mesoderm and endodermal genes it is not absolutely required for their expression. redundancy of other interacting factors is likely to explain this, as in the case of gata <dig> and bon in sox <dig> induction, and a recent study has suggested that foxh <dig> and eomesa act redundantly to mediate all nodal signalling in the zebrafish embryo  <cit> .

to understand better the transcriptional networks that operate in the early zebrafish embryo, we sought to characterize the earliest targets of nodal signalling in zebrafish – just after the onset of zygotic transcription. using a combination of smad <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  and expression microarrays we identify direct targets of nodal signalling. in addition, by reference to published human, mouse and xenopus smad <dig> chip-seq data we show that genomic binding in zebrafish and these species is highly predictive of nodal-responsiveness, indicating that the transcriptional network directed by smad <dig> is conserved in vertebrate mesendoderm.

we also examined the role of eomesa in nodal signalling using chip-seq for eomesa. our findings suggest that eomesa is a general component of the nodal transcriptional complex during mesendoderm formation. we also find that eomesa acts combinatorially with foxh <dig> in formation of endoderm and regulation of some mesodermal gene expression. finally, we use rna-seq analysis of mzeomesa mutant embryos combined with our eomesa chip-seq data and find that eomesa also acts to repress inappropriate transcription of ectodermal genes. thus, our data demonstrate a new role for eomesa in early development and illustrates that the timing of developmental gene expression can be mediated by active repression as well as transcription initiation.

RESULTS
integrated genomic binding and expression data define a set of novel and known nodal targets in zebrafish
in zebrafish, loss of nodal signalling results in the loss of endoderm and most mesoderm, but despite both single gene and genome-scale approaches previously being used to identify nodal target genes in zebrafish  <cit>  the full range of nodal target genes are unlikely to have been identified. in particular, targets at blastula stages have not been systematically studied, despite this being the time when nodal signalling is required for specification of mesoderm and endoderm  <cit> . thus, to identify additional novel nodal targets at this critical time in development we performed microarray expression profiling of embryos at sphere stage  injected with mrna for the zebrafish nodal homologue nodal-related one . this revealed  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes compared to control embryos , which we henceforth refer to as ndr1-responsive genes. comparison with published data revealed that  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes had not previously been implicated as nodal target genes .figure  <dig>

we next sought to validate these results on a selection of the novel targets: foxa, klf <dig>  nhsl1b, notum1a and smarcd3b by in situ hybridisation at sphere and 50% epiboly . at sphere stage we were able to detect an increase in expression of foxa, klf <dig>  nhsl1b and notum1a in ndr <dig> mrna-injected embryos compared to control embryos , even though in situ hybridisation is a less sensitive technique than microarray. conversely, we did not detect expression of these genes in maternal-zygotic oep  mutant embryos, which have no nodal signaling  <cit>  . by 50% epiboly we were able to detect an increase in expression of all five genes by in situ hybridisation in ndr1-injected embryos, whilst mzoep mutant embryos had reduced or absent expression . these results validate our microarray data and indicate that these genes are targets of nodal signalling.

we next performed chip-seq using an antibody specific for smad <dig>  in wild-type embryos at high -sphere stage and integrated this with our overexpression data to identify functional direct targets of nodal signalling. this experiment revealed smad <dig> binding at  <dig> regions across the whole genome . to validate our chip-seq results we performed chip-qpcr on independent biological samples for a selection of regions with variable enrichment . as shown in figure s <dig>  six of the seven peaks we tested have robust enrichment  over the control immunoglobulin g  chip, whilst one peak, smad <dig> peak  <dig>  which was classified at ‘low enrichment’ in our chip-seq data , did not show enrichment over igg, showing our chip-seq data are concordant with independent chip-qpcr data.

our analysis of the chip-seq data shows that smad <dig> binding is enriched within ±10 kb of transcription start sites , revealing a total of  <dig> zebrafish genes with smad <dig> proximal binding . when considering ndr- <dig> responsive genes we also find smad <dig> binding is enriched within ±10 kb of their tsss . from this analysis we find  <dig> genes that are ndr1-responsive and have proximal smad <dig> binding, suggesting they are direct targets of smad2-mediated nodal signalling. of those,  <dig> were previously known to be nodal-regulated including genes required for endoderm formation, such as bon and sox <dig>  and genes required for correct mesoderm formation, such as ntla, tbx <dig>  fgf8a, chd and flh . these known targets are significantly associated with smad <dig> binding , as are our novel ndr1-responsive genes , reinforcing the functional significance of smad <dig> proximal binding and suggesting we have identified bona fide direct targets of smad <dig>  examples of smad <dig> binding proximal to known and novel target genes is shown in figure 1d. furthermore, the novel targets we identified include genes that have roles consistent with nodal activity, such as notum1a and smarcd3b, which have roles in head formation through wnt antagonism  <cit>  and establishment of left-right asymmetry  <cit> , respectively. these novel targets will be of interest in future studies of nodal signalling.

the transcriptional network directed by smad <dig> is conserved amongst vertebrates
although the nodal signalling pathway has been well studied over the last 20 years in multiple vertebrate systems, the extent to which the downstream transcriptional network directed by nodal signalling is conserved has not been comprehensively assessed. our datasets combined with the recently generated human, mouse and xenopus smad <dig> chip-seq datasets  <cit>  offer the first opportunity to explore this, and we sought to exploit these data in order to identify conserved smad <dig> targets in all vertebrates. the mammalian datasets are derived from treated escs which are likely to mimic some of the conditions of the zebrafish blastula including gradients of nodal signalling. more specifically, kim and colleagues performed chip-seq for smad2/ <dig> in control human escs and escs differentiated to endoderm  <cit>  while lee and colleagues performed chip-seq for smad <dig> in control mouse escs, and escs treated with either activin or a nodal/activin receptor inhibitor  <cit> . the xenopus dataset represents smad2/ <dig> binding in whole gastrulae  <cit> .

in order to draw a comparison of genes with proximal smad <dig> binding in these other vertebrates with binding in zebrafish, mammalian and xenopus genes were converted to orthologous zebrafish gene ids . genes with proximal smad <dig> binding within ±10 kb of their tsss were then compared. notably, genes with proximal binding in each species exhibited considerable overlap, with 51%  of genes bound in zebrafish also exhibiting proximal binding in at least one mammalian species . representative peak images of genes with smad <dig> binding in multiple species are shown in figure 2b, including the known nodal target gene, lft <dig>  and a hitherto unrecognized target and regulator of dorsoventral patterning, ddit <dig>  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to determine whether this conserved binding may be functional we next compared genes with proximal smad <dig> binding in all four species to the ndr1-responsive genes from our zebrafish microarray experiment. this revealed that upregulated genes are more likely to have proximal binding in  all four species;  zebrafish and both mammals;  zebrafish, human and xenopus;  zebrafish and xenopus; and  zebrafish alone . on the other hand, genes exhibiting proximal binding in mouse and/or human alone or xenopus alone are no more likely to be ndr1-responsive than by chance. these results suggest that the functional network directed by smad <dig> in zebrafish is substantially conserved amongst other vertebrates.

we next asked where genes with proximal smad <dig> binding are expressed and what functions they perform in zebrafish . as expected, genes with proximal binding in zebrafish show enriched expression at the principle sites of nodal activity in early zebrafish embryogenesis, such as the margin and shield . interestingly though, genes with proximal binding in zebrafish and one or more other species show even greater enrichment for these tissues  whilst genes exhibiting binding in both mouse and human but not zebrafish do not show such enrichment . similarly, genes with proximal binding in zebrafish and one or more other species show greater enrichment for genes involved in developmental processes known to be mediated by nodal signalling, such as mesoderm and endoderm development . in contrast, genes with proximal binding in mouse and human but not zebrafish are not enriched for known nodal processes . taken together these results indicate that the conserved network directs mesendoderm formation.

smad <dig> has been shown recently in mouse to regulate expression of chromatin assembly genes such as histones  <cit> . notably, we detect enrichment for smad <dig> binding proximal to such genes in zebrafish and mouse suggesting smad <dig> may also play a role in regulating chromatin assembly genes in zebrafish .

thus, our analysis indicates that the functional network driven by smad <dig> downstream of nodal signalling is conserved in vertebrate embryos and the mechanisms by which nodal directs mesendoderm formation in vertebrates is likely to be through regulation of the same target genes. in identifying these conserved targets our data represent a resource providing candidates for further study in the context of mesendoderm formation in vertebrates.

genomic co-occurrence of smad <dig> and eomesa is associated with ndr1-responsive genes
as an additional validation of our zebrafish smad <dig> chip-seq data  <cit>  we performed de novo motif finding for smad <dig> bound regions and found the known smad binding element  <cit>  to be enriched and central to peaks , indicating we have identified bona fide targets of smad <dig>  interestingly, we also found the consensus t-box binding site , suggesting smad <dig> may act with a t-box transcription factor in regulating nodal gene expression. in this respect eomesodermin is an obvious candidate: it has an evolutionarily conserved role in mediating nodal signalling, including through physical interaction with smad <dig>  <cit>  and in zebrafish eomesodermin homologue a  is maternally contributed and expressed in the early embryo  <cit> . furthermore induction of some eomesa target genes in zebrafish gastrulae is nodal-dependent  <cit> . in order to explore this further we performed chip-seq in zebrafish using a polyclonal antibody specific for eomesa  at the same stage as our smad <dig> chip. this revealed  <dig>  genomic binding regions for eomesa and  <dig>  genes with proximal eomesa binding within 10 kb of their tss . in order to validate our chip-seq data we performed chip-qpcr on independent biological samples for a selection of peaks that are either bound by eomesa alone or have common binding with smad <dig> . as shown in figure s <dig>  six of the seven peaks we tested, including all those that are common peaks, have robust enrichment  over control igg chip, again showing concordance of our chip-seq results with independent chip-qpcr data. as further validaton, de novo motif finding identified the tbs as enriched and central to peaks in eomesa bound regions .figure  <dig>

we next asked if eomesa and smad <dig> binding co-occurs and found considerable overlap in their genomic binding coordinates, with 41%  of all smad <dig> bound regions co-occurring with eomesa , validating our previous observation that smad <dig> bound regions are enriched for the consensus tbs. of genes with proximal smad <dig> binding, 37%  also exhibit eomesa binding at the same coordinates , while a further 12%  show independent binding of smad <dig> and eomesa in the ±10 kb proximal region . however, t-box and smad binding elements do not form part of the same motif, and although they appear in close proximity to each other they have inconsistent spacing, orientation and strand orientation relative to each other. we also note that of the genes with both smad <dig> and eomesa proximal binding, a high percentage, 54% , show proximal smad <dig> binding in at least one species other than zebrafish . these results suggest that eomesa may mediate the output of nodal signalling at the level of transcription through interaction with smad <dig>  and that the common target genes are conserved nodal target genes in mesendoderm formation.

we next performed gene ontology  and anatomical term analysis of genes with proximal binding and find that lone smad <dig> binding is associated with chromatin genes as previously noted , whilst lone eomesa binding is associated with somitogenesis and neural genes . we also observe that, consistent with our observations above, common binding is associated with the early developmental functions of nodal signalling in mesendoderm formation and embryonic patterning .

in an effort to understand if this common binding is functional we next tested how proximal eomesa and smad <dig> binding relates to our ndr1-responsive genes. we found that upregulated genes are significantly associated with common eomesa and smad <dig> binding in zebrafish whereas proximal binding of smad <dig> alone is not . significantly, functional and anatomical analysis reveals that ndr1-responsive genes with common proximal binding are associated with nodal developmental functions and sites of nodal action, whereas those with proximal binding of smad <dig> without eomesa are not , again indicating that a large part of smad <dig> signalling in zebrafish blastulae involves eomesa. furthermore, genes with proximal smad <dig> and eomesa binding in zebrafish, as well as smad <dig> binding in at least one other species are enriched for developmental functions whilst genes having only proximal smad <dig> in zebrafish and at least one other species, show no such enrichment . taken together these data suggest that eomesa participates in the conserved developmental functions of nodal signalling by regulating a conserved transcriptional network.

as previously noted, lone eomesa binding is associated with genes expressed in structures such as the neural plate . our analysis also revealed a set of genes downregulated on ndr <dig> injection that are significantly associated with lone eomesa genomic binding , which are enriched for known expression in neural structures . however since a consequence of ectopic ndr <dig> expression is induction of mesendoderm leading to a reduction of ectoderm, this association may be due to loss of ectoderm on ndr <dig> overexpression. nevertheless, since eomesa binding is associated with genes expressed in neural structures , it could also imply eomesa has a role in regulating ectodermal gene expression in zebrafish blastulae and we explore this later.

taken together our data indicate that smad <dig> and eomesa act together to regulate early nodal activity, suggesting eomesa may be a general component of the nodal transcriptional complex in the zebrafish blastula. moreover, smad <dig> and eomesa may have independent roles in regulating chromatin assembly and ectodermal gene expression, respectively.

the combinatorial activity of eomesa and foxh <dig> is required for endoderm formation and some mesodermal gene expression
our data show that eomesa and smad <dig> bind proximally to genes required for mesoderm and endoderm formation such as ntla and bon; however, we previously showed that mesoderm formation and marker gene expression are only partially deficient in mzeomesa mutants  <cit> . recent rt-pcr analysis of mzeomesa embryos, showed that ntla and gsc transcript levels are reduced at 30% epiboly, although they show some degree of recovery by shield stage . taken together, this suggests that other factors may also be redundantly required with eomesa to regulate robust mesodermal gene expression. foxh <dig> is a known smad <dig> interacting factor that mediates nodal signalling and a recent study by slagle et al.  <cit>  has implicated eomesa in mediating mesendodermal gene expression in combination with foxh <dig>  in addition, in human escs smad2/ <dig> genomic occupancy is almost completely coincident with foxh <dig>  <cit> . thus, we attempted to characterize foxh <dig> binding in zebrafish blastulae to further explore the relationship between smad <dig>  eomesa and foxh <dig>  unfortunately, no appropriate chip-grade antibody against zebrafish foxh <dig> exists to our knowledge and exhaustive attempts to perform chip-seq for foxh <dig> have been unsuccessful. the conserved mammalian and amphibian foxh <dig> genomic binding consensus has been well characterized, however  <cit> . we used the position frequency matrix available in the jaspar database  <cit>  to identify potential foxh <dig> binding sites in zebrafish. from this analysis we found that consensus foxh <dig> binding sites were present in 24% and 43% of eomesa and smad <dig> chip-seq peaks, respectively, but occurred in 51% of common smad2/eomesa chip-seq peaks . this is a significant enrichment  and implies that a functional relationship between eomesa and foxh <dig> exists through co-occurrence at a subset of smad2-responsive regulatory elements. we, therefore, sought to explore the relative contribution of eomesa and foxh <dig> to early nodal signalling in the zebrafish blastula.

in their recent study slagle and colleagues  <cit>  utilized mzmid mutants  with overexpression of eomesa-eng  to assess the requirement for eomesa and foxh <dig> in nodal signalling in mesendoderm. here, we utilized a complementary approach, morpholino knock down of foxh <dig> in mzeomesa mutant embryos. however, whilst the foxh <dig> morphants largely recapitulate the null phenotype of other animals  <cit> , they do not exhibit notochord defects , suggesting that foxh <dig> knockdown is incomplete. nevertheless, we performed in situ hybridisation of markers indicative of nodal activity in the mesoderm  and endoderm  at 30% epiboly . expression of ntla is not affected in foxh <dig> morphants and is only mildly affected in mzeomesa embryos; however, expression is substantially further downregulated, likely on the dorsal side, in mzeomesa embryos injected with foxh <dig> morpholino  suggesting both factors act combinatorially to regulate ntla expression at this stage . similarly, both factors are required together for gsc expression in the dorsal mesoderm , but consistent with notochord formation being unaffected, they are not required for flh expression . expression of the endoderm marker sox <dig> is not greatly affected in foxh <dig> morphants although it is downregulated in the ventral-lateral margin in mzeomesa embryos; however, expression is completely absent in mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants, again indicating a combinatorial role for these factors . the expression of ntla, gsc and sox <dig> in the mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants at 30% epiboly is similar to that seen in mzoep mutants , which have no nodal signaling, suggesting that eomesa and foxh <dig> are together responsible for mediating the effects of nodal signaling on expression of these genes. although early expression of ntla, gsc and sox <dig> at 30% epiboly is downregulated or absent in mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants, it is possible expression may recover at later stages; therefore, we analysed expression at shield stage . interestingly we found that ntla expression recovered in the dorsal, and to a variable extent in the ventral-lateral, margin, whilst gsc expression recovered to near normal in mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants. on the other hand, sox <dig> expression continued to be strongly affected at shield stage, showing some recovery on the dorsal side but little recovery on the ventral-lateral side in mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants. furthermore, consistent with this reduction in sox <dig> expression at earlier stages, in situ hybridisation at  <dig> hpf for ttna, a marker of cardiac mesoderm and somite boundaries, shows the majority of mzeomesa;foxh <dig> morphants have cardia bifida , confirming an endoderm defect since heart precursors cells to not fuse at the midline in the absence of endoderm  <cit> .figure  <dig>

finally we asked to what extent foxh <dig> and eomesa compensate for each other in regulating nodal signaling by injecting foxh <dig> mrna into mzeomesa mutant embryos, with the expectation that gene expression would be rescued if foxh <dig> can substitute for eomesa. when assaying for gsc expression, which is not much affected in mzeomesa embryos, we did not see any change in expression when foxh <dig> is overexpressed ; however, we found that foxh <dig> mrna is able to partially rescue expression of sox <dig> in the ventral-lateral margin of mzeomesa mutant embryos , suggesting foxh <dig> acts redundantly with eomesa in regulating sox <dig> expression.

from these data we conclude that eomesa and foxh <dig> are together required for some early mesodermal gene expression, and for sox <dig> expression and subsequent endoderm formation. however since the foxh <dig> morpholino may result in incomplete foxh <dig> knockdown it remains an open question, as to exactly which other targets of nodal signalling are functionally regulated by both eomesa and foxh <dig>  in order to definitely determine this it will be necessary to generate homozygous double maternal zygotic mutants for eomesa and foxh <dig> . efforts to do this are ongoing but have so far been unsuccessful.

eomesa represses ectodermal gene expression in the blastula
our eomesa chip-seq data revealed  <dig>  binding sites without significant detection of smad <dig> at the same sites , and functional go term analysis indicates that genes with proximal binding of eomesa without smad <dig> have a potential role in neurogenesis and somitogenesis . these functional roles, however, occur at a time point later than when our data were collected. thus, in order to explore whether eomesa is binding and regulating genes represented in these categories in the zebrafish blastula we generated rna-seq data from wild-type and mzeomesa mutant embryos at the same stage as our chip-seq data to identify eomesa-responsive genes. this revealed  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated genes in mzeomesa mutants . genes upregulated in mzeomesa mutants are enriched for expression in the ectoderm, whilst downregulated genes are enriched for expression in mesendoderm . this further suggests that eomesa may be an activator in the context of mesendoderm and a repressor in the context of ectoderm.figure  <dig>

we then compared these eomesa-responsive genes to eomesa and smad <dig> genomic binding to identify functional binding. we find that lone eomesa binding is significantly associated with genes both up- and down-regulated on loss of eomesa, indicating that eomesa binding independent of smad <dig> is indeed functional and acts in both an active and repressive manner . interestingly, genes with proximal smad <dig> binding without eomesa are also significantly upregulated in mzeomesa mutants, which may suggest that eomesa has an indirect role in regulating smad2-mediated transcriptional repression. furthermore, these genes are highly enriched for chromatin assembly genes , as identified previously . this may suggest that eomesa directly regulates genes which interact with smad <dig> in the regulation of eomesa-independent smad <dig> targets.

further analysis shows that genes downregulated in mzeomesa mutants are associated with nodal sites of action in zebrafish blastulae , once again linking eomesa with transcriptional activation in the context of nodal signalling. on the other hand, genes that are upregulated in mzeomesa mutants are associated with later embryonic neural structures , supporting our earlier observation that genes with eomesa proximal binding are involved in neurogenesis , and suggesting that eomesa acts potentially independently of smad <dig> to repress expression of neurectodermal genes.

in order to explore this further we picked four genes - stm, tfap2a, vgll4l and zic <dig> - that are upregulated in our mzeomesa rna-seq data and that exhibit proximal eomesa binding , and examined their expression by in situ hybridisation in mzeomesa mutant blastulae and in wild-type embryos into which we had injected eomesa mrna. blastula expression of these genes has not been previously described, although later expression has. stm, for instance, is expressed in the anterior neural plate during gastrulation, whilst later in development, it is expressed in the otic vesicle  <cit> . tfap2a and vgll4l are expressed in the non-neural ectoderm during early gastrulation then become localized to the neural crest  <cit> . zic <dig> is expressed at high levels in the neural plate during gastrulation as well as in the margin  <cit> . our results show that these genes are upregulated in mzeomesa mutants , confirming the rna-seq data, whilst overexpression of eomesa leads to strong repression of these genes . these data confirm that eomesa acts to repress transcription of genes normally expressed in the ectoderm.figure  <dig>

discussion
an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional network directed by smad <dig> in mesendoderm gene expression
nodal signalling is an absolute requirement for normal development in the early vertebrate embryo. in zebrafish nodal signalling is active during blastula stages and is required throughout this period to specify mesoderm and endoderm tissues  <cit> . whilst various studies have sought to identify nodal targets in zebrafish at gastrula stages  <cit>  our present study is the first to explore on a genome-wide scale the targets of nodal at this critical time point of mid-blastula stage. through this approach we identified both novel and known targets of nodal signalling, shedding new light on the developmental mechanisms downstream of nodal.

in order to identify direct targets of nodal signalling in the zebrafish blastula we generated chip-seq data for smad <dig>  whilst both smad <dig> and smad <dig> mediate nodal target gene expression, genetic studies in mouse suggest that smad <dig> is critical in early development whereas smad <dig> is not  <cit> . furthermore, our rna-seq data indicate that smad <dig> is 25-fold more highly expressed at sphere stage than either smad3a/b. from this we conclude that smad <dig>  rather than smad <dig>  is more likely to be the critical effector of nodal signalling in early zebrafish development. we cannot discount the possibility, however, that smad <dig> performs important roles downstream of nodal during the developmental period covered in our study.

in assessing the relevance of model organisms, as well as in the study of evolutionary biology, the extent to which common phenotypes are achieved through common mechanisms is of great interest. thus, we utilized smad <dig> chip-seq datasets from mammalian in vitro experiments as a basis for comparison with a xenopus in vivo smad <dig> chip-seq dataset and our zebrafish dataset. this analysis revealed that the transcriptional network directed by smad <dig> is broadly conserved. our analyses indicate that genes with proximal smad <dig> binding are more likely to be induced by ndr <dig>  to function in nodal-mediated processes, and to be expressed at known sites of nodal activity in zebrafish. this is a critical result as it implies that the mesendoderm development directed by nodal occurs by more consistently conserved mechanisms than previously recognized. our data also provide a valuable resource for identifying candidate genes involved in mesendoderm formation downstream of nodal signalling.

interaction of eomesa with smad <dig> and foxh <dig> in mesendoderm formation
smad <dig> interacts with a range of other transcription factors to regulate transcription  <cit> . our chip-seq datasets combined with our ndr <dig> overexpression microarray data indicate that smad <dig> and eomesa co-bind genomic regions and positively regulate the expression of genes associated with the classical developmental functions of nodal signalling in zebrafish. the interaction of eomesdermin with smad <dig> may be a general mechanism downstream of early nodal signalling in vertebrates since in xenopus eomesdermin has been shown also to interact physically with smad <dig>  <cit> .

smad <dig> alone binds upstream of chromatin assembly genes in zebrafish. this is likely to be biologically significant since our interspecies analysis indicates smad <dig> binding proximal to orthologous genes in mouse. it has long-since been recognized that different levels of nodal signalling leads to regulation of different genes, giving rise to different cell fates  <cit> . regulation of chromatin assembly by smad <dig> may relate to how dose-specific regulation of nodal target genes is achieved as it may lead to alterations in the available cis-regulatory elements through which smad <dig> acts. eomesa does not bind proximal to these genes suggesting they are not direct transcriptional targets of eomesa. nevertheless, these genes are upregulated in mzeomesa mutants, suggesting that eomesa regulates these genes indirectly. recently gokhman et al. demonstrated that chromatin assembly genes are targets of tgfbeta-dependent smad <dig> repression  <cit> . it is therefore possible that eomesa regulates factors which cooperate with smad <dig> to mediate this repression. further study of eomesa target gene function and smad <dig> interacting factors will be required to determine this.

our data, together with that of slagle and colleagues  <cit> , indicate that eomesa and foxh <dig> have combinatorial activities in regulating endodermal and mesodermal gene expression. foxh <dig> contains a smad <dig> interaction domain  <cit> , but we do not know if foxh1/smad <dig> act in parallel to eomesa/smad <dig> downstream of nodal signalling, or whether all three factors form a complex to regulate gene expression together. that genomic regions co-occupied by both smad <dig> and eomesa are more likely to contain a putative foxh <dig> binding site than regions individually occupied by either factor suggests that at least in some cases the three factors act through the same regulatory elements. it may also be that in zebrafish much of foxh <dig> genomic binding occurs through physical interaction with other transcription factors, rather than direct binding to dna and, therefore, binds more regulatory elements than predicted in our study. in support of this, slagle and colleagues demonstrated that foxh <dig> mutants lacking the smad interaction domain have a more severe phenotype than those lacking dna binding ability  <cit> . furthermore, in human smad2/ <dig> and foxh <dig> chip-seq data only around a quarter and a half of peaks, respectively, contain the canonical foxh <dig> binding motif  <cit> .

our observations and conclusions on the relative contributions of eomesa and foxh <dig> to mesendodermal gene expression substantiate and further the observations made by slagle et al.  <cit> . their study used a dominant negative eomesa in the context of a foxh <dig> mutant, and suggested that the two factors together regulate the entirety of nodal signaling in early development. we now know, however, that the eomesa dominant negative and genetic null phenotypes are non-equivalent  <cit> , and the use of dominant negative approaches with tbox factors is increasingly considered unreliable due to the common dna binding element shared by all factors  <cit> . our foxh <dig> knockdown in mzeomesa mutants suggests that eomesa and foxh <dig> do indeed combinatorially mediate endoderm formation and at least some early mesoderm marker expression. furthermore, our data suggest that eomesa and foxh <dig> are at least partially functionally redundant, since overexpression of foxh <dig> can partially rescue loss of sox <dig> expression in mzeomesa mutants. this redundancy is likely to occur through common regulatory elements used by both these factors and smad <dig> downstream of nodal. it is possible that more complete abrogation of foxh <dig> function in mzeomesa mutants would reveal further functional relationships and attempts to generate double maternal zygotic mutants for eomesa and foxh <dig> are ongoing.

zebrafish contain two eomesodermin homologues and it is possible that eomesa acts redundantly with its paralogue as well as other factors. however, our data suggest that this is highly unlikely. in our rna-seq experiment, although we detect expression for 78% of all annotated genes , we do not detect expression of eomesb either in wild-type or mzeomesa mutant embryos. from this we conclude that eomesa and eomesb are not functionally redundant in early development.

a role for eomesa in ectodermal gene expression
perhaps our most striking finding is that eomesa acts to repress early ectodermal gene expression, suggesting that as well as positively influencing mesendodermal formation through activation of mesendodermal genes, it also exerts an influence through repressing inappropriate ectodermal gene expression at the onset of zygotic transcription.

eomesa is expressed in the zebrafish telencephalon at later developmental stages  <cit>  and a role for eomes in neurogenesis has previously been revealed in mouse brain  <cit> . significantly, our data indicate a role in the regulation of neuroectoderm gene expression far earlier than previously realized. amongst the eomesa-repressed genes are critical regulators of neurectodermal structures. for example, overexpression of tfap2a induces ectopic neural crest in zebrafish  <cit> ; loss of zic <dig> leads to broadened neural plate  <cit> . however, not all of the neuroectoderm-expressed genes we identify as being repressed by eomesa are restricted to the neuroectoderm, for example, sp5l, fgfr1b and zic <dig> are expressed in some mesodermal structures, such as the segmental plate. nevertheless, anatomy term analysis shows that neuroectodermal expression, as based on published descriptions of expression at later stages than our study, is the defining characteristic of eomesa-repressed genes. our results represent a completely new component in the regulation of ectodermal gene expression in the early zebrafish embryo.

eomesodermin is generally considered an activator of transcription  <cit> , although it has recently been proposed to directly repress a subset of mesodermal genes during endoderm formation in vitro in human and in mouse embryos  <cit> . eomesa binds upstream of  <dig> genes whose expression is up-regulated in the absence of eomesa in zebrafish blastulas, suggesting it is directly repressing these genes. however, we are unable to distinguish whether eomesa acts itself as a repressor or whether it interacts with another protein that represses gene expression. the latter possibility seems most likely given that in the early embryo eomesa expression is not spatially restricted  <cit> , it can both activate and repress gene expression , and in activating mesendodermal gene expression it does so through interaction with smad <dig>  in this scenario the activity of eomesa would depend on the partner it interacts with, allowing it to have different roles in different domains of the embryo if the partner protein had restricted expression or activity.

we note a recently published study by gentsch and colleagues, which implicates eomesodermin and other t-box factors in xenopus in neural-mesodermal cell fate decisions  <cit> . in their study they find that combinatorial loss of t-box factors at gastrula and tail bud stages leads to a failure to specify mesoderm, with consequent gain of neural tissues. our finding that eomesa acts in transcriptional repression of ectodermal genes at the onset of zygotic transcription is fundamentally different; it demonstrates that in zebrafish a maternally contributed t-box factor restricts the expression of ectodermal genes at blastula stages. combined with its known role in mesendoderm formation our analyses reveal that eomesa regulates the formation of all three germ layers in the early embryo.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we investigated the transcriptional network directed by nodal signalling in the early zebrafish embryo and its relationship with human, mouse and xenopus data. we did this using a combination of smad <dig> chip-seq and expression microarrays. our data indicate that smad <dig> directs highly similar transcriptional networks in several vertebrate species and provide a new insight into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of mesoderm and endoderm formation mediated by nodal. our data also represent a valuable resource for identifying potentially interesting genes for study in the context of nodal signalling. comparison of zebrafish smad <dig> and eomesa chip-seq data suggests that eomesa acts as a general mediator of the conserved developmental functions of nodal signalling in the early zebrafish embryo. eomesa also acts to repress expression of ectoderm markers. as a maternally contributed factor eomesa protein is present at the onset of zygotic transcription. our data indicate that its early function is to activate a conserved nodal transcriptional network whilst repressing ectodermal genes, thus ensuring correct spatiotemporal expression in early development.
