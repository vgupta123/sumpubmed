BACKGROUND
the earwigs  are familiar insects, often unwelcomed, mainly due to their nocturnal habit, some feeding on decaying matters, emitting foul smell, and an unfounded myth that earwigs would crawl into peoples' ears and penetrate into their brains during sleep. the dermaptera belongs to a group of winged insects of uncertain relationship within polyneoptera, which has expanded anal region and adds numerous anal veins in the hind wing  <cit> . earwigs are very scarce in the insect fossil record. nel et al. in  <dig> listed only  <dig> taxa of dermaptera described, figured or simply mentioned in literature  <cit> . even with subsequent addition of  <dig> species, the fossil record of the dermaptera stands at  <dig> species  <cit> . evolutional history and origin of dermaptera have been in contention, especially for the fossil earwigs.

here we report a new genus with two new species  and belloderma ovata sp. nov. ) in a new family of bellodermatidae fam. nov., from the middle jurassic  of the jiulongshan formation  <cit>  in daohugou  of ningcheng county, inner mongolia, china. our study of these two earwigs and phylogenetic results provide new understanding of earwigs' origin and evolutional process and enable us to update the phylogenetic and evolutional relationships among major lineages of earwigs.

methods
the specimens were examined with a leica mz <dig>  dissecting microscope and illustrated with the aid of a drawing tube attached to the microscope. line drawings were made with photoshop <dig>  graphics software. morphological terms used here follow those by michael s. engel and fabian haas  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
the relationships of fossil dermaptera is re-assessed, the fossil taxa used in the phylogenetic analyses of fossil dermaptera are listed in table  <dig>  this study predominantly used body characters, because wing characters and male genitalia characters are almost always poorly preserved in fossils. we followed the original descriptions because these fossils were not available to us. our phylogenetic analyses of dermaptera used limited characters to study the reliability and position of the new family bellodermatidae fam. nov. rather than the inter-relationships of dermaptera. thus, if a fossil earwig genus contains several species, only one representative species was chosen to keep the number of taxa low for computational reasons. the character matrix for this dataset is shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  we constructed matrices with  <dig> taxa,  <dig> characters and  <dig> taxa,  <dig> characters separately. the two matrices are the same for the fossil species, but they are different in three additional extant taxa in table  <dig>  three species of blattodea  and a species of plecoptera   <cit>  are used as outgroup.

*: only present in matrix of table  <dig> 

 "?": character not applicable or missing.

"?": character not applicable or missing.

all characters were treated as unordered and weighted equally. the data matrices were subjected to the parsimony analyses in nona and paup*   <cit> . the two programs implement heuristic searches somewhat differently, and so both were employed. because program nona can be only defined one outgroup, so we conducted the cladistic analyses by each outgroups respectively. heuristic search in winclada/nona used multiple random additions of taxa and tree-bisection resection branch swapping . heuristic search in paup*  employed a heuristic parsimony analyses, with  <dig> random stepwise additions of taxa  under acctran optimization.

to comply with regulations of the international code of zoological nomenclature , we have deposited paper copies of the above article at the natural history museum, london; the american museum of natural history, new york; the mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, paris; the russian academy of sciences, moscow; and the academia sinica, taipei.

remarks
the two species are very similar to each other in body size and eye size, but they differ from each other by shape of the pronotum, pro-sternum and abdominal segments, and they have distinctly different tegmina shapes.

a new family is erected based on these two well-preserved, unique fossil specimens with an unexpected combination of characters . the combined characters of this new family allow its allocation to the suborder eodermaptera: tarsi three-segmented, tegmina retain venation, 8th and 9th abdominal tergite in females are narrowed, but separate from 10th tergite and not covered by 7th tergite and exposed ovipositor. however, there are some particular features of the new family, which are not present for other fossils of eodermaptera. for instance, the cerci are segmented, which makes the new family be strikingly analogous to the species of suborder archidermaptera. on the other hand, the new family has a character assemblage similar to extant insects in neodermaptera, namely, tarsi three-segmented, and 1st segment long and stout, 2nd shortest and distinctly extended distally beneath 3rd one . the tarsi character is an important family character in the classification of dermaptera. the species of dermapteridae of suborder archidermaptera has  <dig> tarsi segments for fore, middle and hind legs, i.e. 5-5- <dig>  the tarsi segments of protodiplatidae of suborder archidermaptera are 4-4- <dig>  semenoviolidae and turanodermatidae of suborder eodermaptera and all extant earwigs possess tarsi with three tarsomeres, 3-3- <dig>  of which the shape of the 2nd segment is considered as a family character. with respect to tarsi, the new family is close to the modern dermaptera  <cit> .

no. = number

in summary, the above-mentioned characters show that the placement of the new family to the suborder eodermaptera is dubious. to make sure its exact placement, we set up two matrices and carried out phylogenetic analyses, one with only fossil taxa and the other with fossil and three representatives of extant taxa.

results of phylogenetic analyses
the phylogenetic analyses of table  <dig> by nona, we get four most parsimonious trees, tree length =  <dig>  consistency index =  <dig> , retention index =  <dig>  , and by paup, we get  <dig> most parsimonious trees, tree length =  <dig>  consistency index =  <dig> , retention index =  <dig>  . the phylogenetic analyses of table  <dig> by nona, we get two most parsimonious trees, tree length =  <dig>  consistency index =  <dig> , retention index =  <dig>  , and by paup, we get four most parsimonious trees, tree length =  <dig>  consistency index =  <dig> , retention index =  <dig>  . the results by the two programs are similar, and results conducted by nona with the species of blattodea as outgroup are same . the best supported trees are shown in figure  <dig> 

phylogenetic analyses show that the order dermaptera is divided into two clades: archidermaptera and eodermaptera  . the monophyly of archidermaptera is confirmed in all the analyses, supported by two synapomorphies: straight hind margin of head  and pleural overlapping of abdominal tergites and sternites  . the suborder eodermaptera is well assembled in the analyses that is only concerned for the fossil taxa, supported by one synapomorphic character: fusion of 8th and 9th abdominal tergites in females  . however in the analysis including the extant representatives, eodermaptera grouping with neodermaptera constitute a monophyly, sharing with cha.  <dig> . although it resulted in some different cladograms, our new family is firmly assigned to the eodermaptera or , representing a stem-group of the clade.

discussion
about the suborder eodermaptera
earwigs from the jurassic were usually classified in the extinct suborder archidermaptera, comprising the known basalmost lineage, which persisted until the earliest cretaceous  <cit> . the genus semenoviola martynov,  <dig> was placed in coleoptera when it was erected, then it was transferred to pygidicranidae verhoeff,  <dig> together with semenoviolidae and turanodermidae, which is a family of known neodermaptera  <cit> . besides, as demonstrated by willmann  <cit>  and haas and kukalova-peck  <cit> , the semenoviolidae and turanodermidae are more closely allied to suborder neodermaptera owing to the unsegmented cerci but excluded from the latter owing to the plesicmorphic retention of venation in the tegmina. for this reason, engel  <cit>  proposed a new name, eodermaptera, including semenoviolidae and turanodermidae. according to the phylogenetic analyses here, the so-called suborder eodermaptera becomes paraphyletic, and so we considered that the previously defined eodermaptera species should be returned to the neodermaptera or to combine them together as a new classification group.

about the evolutional history and origin of dermaptera
evolutional history and origin of dermaptera have been in contention, with dramatically different viewpoints by contemporary authors. some experts suggested the oldest fossils to date are tegmina from the late triassic of england and australia  <cit> , but because of the poor preservation, others suggested the dermaptera probably originated during early mesozoic in asia  <cit> .

our study of these earwigs and phylogenetic results have shed light on evolutional process and origin. the dermapteridae species have 5-5- <dig> tarsi, the same as protelytroptera, protodiplatyidae species have 4-4- <dig> tarsi, and then  species have 3-3- <dig> taici. on the other hand, the unique nature of hind wing in dermapteridae indicates a closer relationship with protelytridae among protelytroptera, which is considered as the ancestor of dermaptera. the afore-mentioned summary shows that dermapteridae is the most basal in the dermaptera and they are present in middle jurassic. protodiplatyidae was discovered only from the late jurassic  <cit> . the more derived bellodermatidae fam. nov. was present in the middle jurassic of jiulongshan formation in daohugou. therefore, it is suggested that the oldest dermaptera might possibly be traced back to the late triassic-early jurassic and they had divided into archidermaptera and  not later than early jurassic.

the turanodermatidae is presently known only from the late jurassic of central asia but may extend to the early cretaceous if the genus archaeosoma  <cit>  proves to be allied  <cit> . in figure 3c, phylogenetic analysis shows that character  <dig> weakly supports the combination of archaeosoma and turanoderma to be turanodermatidae, but in the strict consensus tree, namely figure 3b, archaeosoma and turanoderma are paraphyletic, so further research is needed about whether the genus archaeosoma can be allied to the family turanodermatidae. the previously known eodermapterans up to date have been documented only from the late jurassic of karatau in chimkent province of kazakhstan  <cit> . the discovery of bellodermatidae fam. nov. extends the age of previous eodermapptera to the middle jurassic.

the previous neodermapterans first appear in the early cretaceous  <cit>  but might have originated in the late jurassic  <cit> . certainly, definitive neodermapterans and recognizable pygidicranids are known by the middle cretaceous  <cit> . in summary, following grimaldi and engel  <cit> , the evolution of dermaptera is updated in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this new family bellodermatidae fam. nov., bridging the missing link between suborders of archidermaptera and eodermaptera greatly enhanced the understandings of early evolution of dermaptera. based on the phylogenetic analysis, the new family is attributed to the eodermaptera or  unambiguously, representing a stem-group of the clade. the suborder eodermaptera becomes paraphyletic with neodermaptera, and the previously defined eodermaptera species should be returned to neodermaptera or to combine them together. it is suggested that the oldest dermaptera might possibly be traced back to the late triassic-early jurassic and they had divided into archidermaptera and  in the middle jurassic.
