BACKGROUND
para-nitrophenol , which is widely used in the manufacture of medicines, pesticides, dyes, explosives, leather coloring, wood preservatives and rubber chemicals, is highly toxic to animal’s health. through the respiratory system and skin it affects the blood, liver and central nervous system in the body. it can cause dizziness, rash, itching spam, anemia and various neurological symptoms  <cit> . it contains a nitroso group in the structure that strongly attracts the electron of phenyl, thus pnp is difficult for degradation in the nature  <cit> .therefore, a number of studies have been triggered focusing on the microbial degradation of pnp  <cit>  and two pathways have been clearly illustrated so far. one is the hydroquinone pathway that is usually found in gram-negative bacteria. for example, in moraxella sp, pnp monooxygenase converts pnp to hydroquinone via the potential intermediate p-benzoquinone  <cit> . the other is the hydroxyquinol  pathway that is preferentially found in gram-positive bacteria. for example, in rhodococcus opacus sao <dig>  pnp is converted to hydroxyquinol via 4-nitrocatechol  <cit> .

pseudomonas sp. strain wbc- <dig> utilizes either methyl parathion  or pnp as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy for survival  <cit> . this bacterium degrades pnp through the hydroquinone pathway. first, pnp is converted to p-benzoquinone by pnp 4-monooxygenase  and p-benzoquinoneis further reduced to hydroquinone by p-benzoquinone reductase . next, hydroquinone dioxygenase  converts hydroquinone to γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde, which is then converted to maleyacetate by the nad dependent γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase . finally, maleylacetate reductase  catalyzes the conversion of maleyacetate to β-ketoadipate before entering the tca cycle.

in contrast to the reasonably thorough biochemical and genetic characterization of the pnp degradation, the structural mechanism of each reaction step in the pathway remains unclear. in order to understand the structural basis required for the activity of the enzyme, we embarked on structure determination of these enzymes that catalyze the pnp degradation process.

recently, the primary x-ray analysis of pnpa in p.putida dll-e <dig> was reported. in which pnpa was crystallized and the diffraction data was obtained  <cit> . however, there was no further structural report about the enzyme or other molecules involved in the hydroquinone pathway. pnpe belongs to nad dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase  super-family which can catalyze the aldehydes oxidation to corresponding carboxylic acids  <cit> . to date, some crystal structures of nad  + - dependent aldh family have been reported  <cit> . these enzymes exhibit wide differences in substrate and cofactor specificity. sequence alignments of them with pnpe gave amino acid sequence identities ranging from 23% to 45%. among them mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase from bovine gives the highest sequence identity with pnpe.

this super family involves highly conserved residues cys which was essential nucleophile and glu that was the general base necessary to activate cys for the dehydrogenase reaction. the substrate of pnpe is γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde which is unstable in air. so far the catalytic mechanism of this substrate has not been reported. in the current study, we determined the crystal structure of pseudomonas sp. strain wbc- <dig> apo-pnpe at  <dig>  Å resolution and its complex with nad at  <dig>  Å resolution. through enzyme-substrate docking-guided point mutations, we identified the active site of pnpe and studied its catalytic mechanism.

gene cloning and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis sequencing
pnpe gene from pseudomonas sp. strain wbc- <dig> was cloned into ndei and xhoi sites of pet29b . nine pnpe mutants  were produced using the two-step pcr strategy  <cit>  and were confirmed by dna sequencing.

protein expression and purification
the e.coli cells were cultured in the lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin until od <dig> reached  <dig>  and were then induced with  <dig> mm iptg overnight at 15°c. the cells were harvested by centrifugation. cells lysis was achieved by sonication method. after centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min, the supernatant was applied to ni-nta column. the his-tagged pnpe was eluted with elution buffer . the purification process was then followed by anion exchange on a source-q column and finally applied to size-exclusion chromatography with superdex- <dig> column.

enzyme activity assays
the catalytic activity of pnpe was measured by cascade reactions. the biosynthesis of γ-hydroxymuconic was performed in a total volume of  <dig> μl system containing  <dig>  mm hydroquinone,  <dig> μg hydroquinone dioxygenase pnpcd  and  <dig>  mm feso <dig> and 100mm tris–hcl  at 25°c. the absorbance of the reaction mixture was monitored at  <dig> nm until no further decrease was observed . at this point, the product solution can be used as the substrate for the next step to test pnpe activity. the assay of pnpe was performed immediately after the production of γ-hydroxymuconic in 100μl reaction system containing  <dig>  μg purified pnpe,  <dig> μl γ-hydroxymuconic ,  <dig>  mm nad and  <dig> mm tris–hcl . the reaction was incubated at 25°c for  <dig> min. pnpe activity was determined by measuring the absorbance increase at  <dig> nm due to nadh formation.

crystallization and data collection
protein concentration was adjusted to  <dig> mg/ml before setting up crystallization screens at 20°c. initially the native crystals were grown from 20%  peg <dig>   <dig>  m kno <dig> at 20°c using the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion technique. the crystallization condition for the nad bound pnpe was  <dig>  m bicine ph  <dig> , 20% peg <dig> and  <dig> mm nad. both data of the two kinds of crystals were collected on bl17u beam line at the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility  using a mar  <dig> ccd detector. crystals were equilibrated in a cryoprotection buffer containing 15% glycerol  plus reservoir buffer and then flash frozen in a 100k nitrogen stream. the diffraction images were processed with hkl <dig>  <cit> .

flexible docking of substrate to pnpe
autodock  <dig>   <cit>  was used to carry out the pnpe-substrate flexible docking. three out of the nine bonds of the substrate molecule γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde were set rotatable. a grid box with sufficient margins , which enveloped the potential active region of pnpe, was placed to restrain the substrate molecule. this potential active region was implicated by the structure of e.coli l-lactaldehyde dehydrogenases   <cit> , which is homologous with pnpe. in the active region of pnpe,  <dig> residues  were assigned as flexible. a genetic search algorithm  <cit>  was used for the docking and a total of  <dig> , <dig> steps of energy evaluations were performed during the docking. finally, the first ranked docking result according to the interaction energy was chosen as the result. the flexible docking was performed on a 12-core computer station, which consists of intel itanium <dig> dual core running at  <dig>  ghz. the average wall clock for one docking run was about  <dig> hours.

RESULTS
overall structure of apo-pnpe
the crystal belongs to space group p <dig>  the asymmetric unit contains eight monomers named a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h which form four homodimers . the monomer of pnpe has the typical structural organization βαβ of the aldh family, with  <dig> β-strands  and  <dig> α-helices  . these secondary structures belong to three domains : a substrate binding domain, a cofactor binding domain, and an oligomerization domain mediating protein dimerization.

the substrate binding domain consists of a central six-stranded β-sheet  and six α-helices , while the cofactor binding domain contains a nine-stranded β-sheet   and seven α-helices  .

the four homodimers show high structural similarities. structure comparisons between ac and other three homodimmers give root mean square deviation  values of  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for cα respectively. the dimer interface consists of β <dig> , β <dig> , loop <dig>  and loop <dig>  . loop <dig> connects β <dig> and α <dig>  loop <dig> is sited in the c terminal. the interface area of the pnpe monomer for dimerization is  <dig>  Å.

among all the structure-known homologues of pnpe, the bovine aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit>  shares the highest sequence identity  with pnpe. the human aldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit>  follows close behind with a sequence identity of 44%. the result of sequence alignment indicates these proteins may share similar structures. structure superimposition shows bovine aldehyde dehydrogenase has a rmsd of  <dig>  Å for cα with pnpe, meanwhile the cα rmsd between human aldehyde dehydrogenase and pnpe is  <dig>  Å.

structure of pnpe-nad complex
there are also eight pnpe-nad complexes in asymmetric unit. nad molecule was found in all pnpe monomers . the cofactor binding domain of pnpe is gathered together like a clamp that can hold the nad .

in the pnpe-nad complex structure, nad is situated in a cleft of pnpe. the cofactor binding site is composed of two pockets. the adenosine and the first ribose group of nad bind in one pocket and the nicotinamide ring in the other. there are several hydrogen bond interactions between pnpe and nad. the adenine n1a amino group of nad forms a hydrogen bond with oe <dig> of q <dig> of pnpe. the ribose hydroxyl groups o2b and o3b receive hydrogen bonds from the side chain of k <dig> and v <dig>  respectively. the diphosphate o2n donates a hydrogen bond to w <dig>  the c4n accepts a hydrogen bond from c <dig>  n7n accepts a hydrogen bond from e <dig> .

the pnpe structure of the pnpe-nad complex is quite similar to apo-pnpe with a cα rmsd of  <dig>  Å. the most significant structural discrimination is observed at the loop between l <dig> and g <dig>  in which the spatial position of the e <dig> moved  <dig>  Å. this segment belongs to nad binding region. in the apo-pnpe structure, this loop blocks the nad binding site. in the complex structure, however, it moves to open the binding site to create enough space for nad binding .

structural bases for the specificity of cofactor binding
so far, both nad and nadp have been known to be cofactors of the aldh family. pnpe specifically uses nad as cofactor. in order to elucidate the structural basis for the coenzyme specificity of pnpe, we compared structures of pnpe-nad and nadp bound betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase   from pseudomonas aeruginosa <cit>  . among nadp dependent proteins with known structures, badh shares the highest sequence identity of 41% with pnpe. since the only difference between nad and nadp is that the later has an extra phosphate group, pnpe and badh should be able to distinguish them by this point. both pnpe and badh contain a two-pocket nad  binding site. the first pocket is close to the molecule surface and accommodates the adenosine moiety of nad, whereas the second, which is deeply located in the active site, can accommodate the nicotinamide ribose moiety. from the structures we can see clearly that the second pocket of badh is wider than that of pnpe. this means badh has extra space to accommodate the phosphate group of nadp whereas pnpe does not. on the other hand, in badh the cofactor bind pocket surface around phosphate group is highly positive charged to match the negative charge of the phosphate group. this is not the case in pnpe. therefore, pnpe can only use nad rather than nadp as its cofactor.

molecular docking results and mutagenesis analysis
the substrate γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde for pnpe contains an enol structure, which tends to convert into keto under aerobic condition. so it is impracticable to get holo-pnpe structure. to figure out the catalytic mechanism of pnpe without holo-pnpe structure we performed flexible docking for nad bound pnpe and γ-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde using autodock . the docking result is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the substrate located in a narrow cleft close to nad. there are nine residues  probably involved in the substrate binding. c <dig> forms hydrogen bond with the aldehyde group of the substrate directly and may play a key role in the enzymatic reaction. f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  w <dig>  n <dig>  i <dig> and h <dig> probably composed a hydrophobic pocket to accommodate the substrate. however, w <dig> and f <dig> are a little farther from the substrate compared to other five residues.

to confirm the molecular docking result, nine single amino acid mutants  were generated using a two-step pcr strategy. their enzyme activities were then measured and repeated four times . the results showed the mutants of c281a, e247k, n149d, f150a, h275e and i282d completely lost their activity. the activity of f154a decreased about 60%. the activity of w157aand f447a decreased about 20%. c <dig> and e <dig>  which are highly conserved across the aldh family members, have been known to play essential roles in the catalytic process. the loss of pnpe activity by n149d, f150a, h275e, i282d, and the significant decrease of the activity by f154a also argue that these amino acids play important roles in the substrate binding. w <dig> and f <dig> do not contact substrate directly, thus w157a and f447a only affected enzymatic activity modestly, compared to the significant effects of other seven mutations. these data are consistent with the result of autodock calculations.

CONCLUSIONS
sequence-based alignment of pnpe and previously determined structures of aldhs shows that two residues  are highly conserved across different species . these two amino acids act as the catalytic residues that transport electron, according to the mechanism elucidated in other homologous proteins  <cit> . in this regard, pnpe may have a similar catalytic mechanism . the catalytic c <dig> plays a role as a nucleophilic reagent. it attacks the hydroxymuconic semialdehyde substrate and forms a covalent intermediate. next, the hydride from this intermediate transfers to nad to form nadh and the thioacyl enzyme intermediate. the other catalytic residue e <dig> directly attacks the acyl-sulfur bond and releases the acid product prior to nadh dissociation.
