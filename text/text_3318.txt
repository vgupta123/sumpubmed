BACKGROUND
bacteriophages have critically important roles in genome diversification and the evolution of virulence and host adaptation of enteric bacteria. genes encoding shiga toxins   <dig> and  <dig> are found on lambdoid phages in shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, while similar gifsy and fels phages encode a number of virulence factors in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. in addition to carrying genes encoding virulence factors, integrated prophage can affect gene expression of the host bacterium.

the recent demonstration of three distinct bacteriophages integrated into the genome of campylobacter jejuni chicken isolate rm <dig> suggested that such phages may be common and important for the biology of c. jejuni <cit> . at least one of these three c. jejuni integrated elements   <cit>  was a mu-like phage inducible with mitomycin c designated cjie <dig> . elements similar to these cjies were found quite frequently when a large panel of isolates was tested using a dna microarray, and cmlp <dig> appeared to integrate essentially randomly in the genome  <cit> . results from southern blotting using cmlp <dig> genes as probes also showed that this phage appeared to be capable of loss and insertion or re-insertion into different parts of the c. jejuni genome, producing changes in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  patterns  <cit> , and induction of prophages was found to be responsible for extensive genomic rearrangements in bacteria subject to predation by lytic bacteriophages  <cit> . partial sequencing of a panel of  <dig> homologs of cmlp <dig> suggested these prophages have a mosaic structure due to recombination but did not identify inserted genes  <cit> . recent work has identified putative inserted genes after completely sequencing four of these prophages  <cit> . the translation product of one of these indels, orf <dig>  was a hypothetical protein with no described function and an extremely limited distribution outside the prophages characterized. proteomics experiments verified that this protein was expressed when isolates were grown on normal laboratory medium and up-regulated in the presence of bile salts .

this work was undertaken to determine whether the prophages associated with a group of highly related c. jejuni isolates affected the biology or virulence of the bacteria. isolates carrying the prophage demonstrated higher levels of adherence and invasion in cell culture assays than those without. the presence of the prophage did not appear to greatly affect the severity of patient symptoms, host specificity, or host adaptation.

RESULTS
strain characteristics
the set of isolates used consisted of three c. jejuni isolates  that carried a prophage homologous with, and closely related to, cjie <dig> from strain rm <dig>  <cit> . one isolate, 00– <dig>  did not carry the prophage. a few putative differences in gene content were detected in these four isolates using comparative genomic hybridization. pcr for these genes was done to confirm absence or divergence , and isolates were considered positive for the gene if it was present in either microarray or pcr analysis. no differences in gene content were found after the results of these analyses were completed and the isolates were considered genetically indistinguishable except for the lack of the cjie1-family prophage in 00–2426; this evidence was crucial for allowing the research to proceed further.

all four isolates appeared fully motile when grown in semi-solid agar at 37°c under microaerobic conditions. the mean diameter of swarming growth in mm was as follows: 00– <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; 00– <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig> ; 00– <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; 00- <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> . analysis using the one way anova indicated that there was no significant statistical difference between strains , though the low value for the latter measure indicates results should be interpreted cautiously.

growth curves were done to determine whether the presence or absence of the cjie1-family prophage affected growth of the organism. each growth curve experiment compared one of the isolates carrying the cjie <dig> prophage homolog with isolate 00– <dig>  which lacked the prophage . the growth curves shown are representative of the results from a number of growth curve experiments. there were subtle differences in growth in mid-log phase, with 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig> all growing slightly faster  than 00– <dig>  though extremely subtle, this appeared to be consistent between experiments. doubling times in mid-log phase were between  <dig>  h and  <dig> h depending on the experiment.

adherence and invasion studies
isolates carrying the cjei <dig> prophage homologs showed a moderate, but reproducible, difference in adherence and invasion . control strain c. jejuni 81– <dig> was, on average, about 3-fold more adherent than the other c. jejuni isolates, and was 17-fold more adherent than isolate 00– <dig> . when all experimental replicates were assessed together the adherence levels of the three isolates carrying the prophage were approximately 6- to 7-fold that of the isolate without the prophage , though statistical significance was not reached in pairwise comparisons by one-way anova with the holm-sidak test. despite this, experiments in which all four test strains were included were consistent in the trend to greater adherence among isolates carrying the prophage .

to assess invasion, differences in adherence are controlled for by calculating the % invaded/% adhered ratios . invasion was associated, independently of adherence, with carriage of the cjie <dig> prophage homolog . control strain 81– <dig> exhibited about 28-fold greater invasion than 00– <dig> . isolate 00– <dig>  which carries the prophage, was 21-fold more invasive than 00– <dig>  a statistically significant result in pairwise comparisons using the holm-sidak method . prophage-carrying isolates 00– <dig> and 00– <dig> were 16-fold and 17-fold more invasive than isolate 00– <dig> lacking the prophage. these results were not statistically significant in pairwise comparisons in one-way anova using the holm-sidak test. e. coli top  <dig> was used as a negative control for invasion; the levels of invasion of isolate 00– <dig> and top  <dig> were very similar throughout the experiments. once again, the observation that isolate 00– <dig> was much less invasive than the other c. jejuni strains was observed consistently in experiments in which all isolates were tested within a single experiment, on the same day .

association of prophage with patient symptoms and source
data on patient symptoms and the associated c. jejuni recovered from the patients was obtained through a collaboration between the national microbiology laboratory and the centre for foodborne, environmental, and zoonotic infectious diseases in guelph, on, which administers the c-enternet sentinel site surveillance program in the region of waterloo, on  <cit> . this has allowed comparisons of the cjie <dig> prophage genotype with patient symptoms. the pcr method developed for single-step detection of cjie <dig> also assesses the presence or absence of an indel or moron carrying the unique coding sequence orf <dig>  <cit> . results are summarized in table  <dig> and can be interpreted as in the following example. of all  <dig> patients answering the question of whether they had abdominal pain, for instance,  <dig> answered “yes” and the remainder answered “no”. among the  <dig> patients from whom c. jejuni without cjie <dig> was isolated and who also answered the question on the questionnaire,  <dig> had abdominal pain and  <dig> did not. similar interpretation can be applied throughout the table. as a whole these analyses suggested that the presence of orf <dig> may be responsible for higher rates of bloody diarrhea and hospitalization and lower rates of headache, while the presence of the cjie <dig> prophage was associated with lower rates of vomiting and longer duration of illness. none of these differences were statistically significant. differences in the rates of abdominal pain and fever were significant, with higher rates observed from isolates lacking cjie <dig> . in both cases the difference in rates remained significant when rates of each symptom were compared pairwise between isolates without cjie <dig> and those with cjie <dig> alone  but were not significant when isolates with cjie1 + orf <dig> were compared with isolates carrying either cjie <dig> only or no cjie <dig> at all.

note that there were different response rates for different questions, resulting in different denominators. “patients with symptoms” refers to the number of patients having the particular symptom compared with the total number of patients answering the question yes or no on the questionnaire. this column provides data on the overall frequency of symptoms. isolates for further analysis were not available for all patients answering the comprehensive questionnaire. data in the section “association of c. jejuni strain characteristics with symptoms…” contains symptom information from patients from whom isolates were obtained and were typed. the frequencies with which each symptom was associated with the presence of absence of the cjie <dig> prophage and also the presence within the cjie prophage of orf <dig> have been compared to determine whether either cjie <dig> alone or cjie <dig> with orf <dig> have any significant effect on patient symptoms compared with absence of the prophage.

c-enternet also recovers bacteria from food, animals, and environmental sources within the sentinel site. these isolates were used to assess whether there was any association between the presence of the cjie <dig> prophage or the cjie <dig> prophage + orf <dig> and recovery of campylobacter spp. from particular sources. the data summarized in table  <dig> indicate that there was a much higher percentage of c. jejuni isolates without the cjie <dig> prophage from water than from chicken breast, humans, and pigs . a higher number of c. jejuni without the cjie <dig> prophage was also found in isolates from bovine manure  compared with isolates from retail chicken breast. the carriage of cjie <dig> and cjie1 + orf <dig> was significantly higher in c. coli in isolates from chicken than those from humans . other differences were noted but not tested for statistical significance because of the small numbers involved .

there appeared to be a somewhat stronger association of orf <dig> with multi-locus sequence types   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . similarly, cjie <dig> alone was found more frequently in sts  <dig> and  <dig>  associations of cjie <dig> alone with other sts were less certain due to the small number of isolates detected for each st. all isolates belonging to sts  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> carried cjie <dig>  but only 2– <dig> isolates of each st were available. similarly, orf  <dig> was found with higher frequency in flaa svr types  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

discussion
cjie1-positive isolates were around  <dig> to 7-fold more adherent and  <dig> to 21-fold more invasive for int- <dig> cells in culture than the isolate that did not carry this prophage. these values are close to those found when other genes have been examined; a similar 7-fold increase in adherence to int- <dig> cells was found with a cj <dig>  mutant versus the wild-type strain  <cit> . mutants in waaf showed a 14-fold reduction in invasion of int <dig> cells compared with the wild type strain  <cit> . disruption mutants of adhesin-encoding genes cadf and flpa exhibited a 72% and 62% reduction in adherence, respectively  <cit> . insertion mutagenesis of cj <dig> encoding the tlya product caused a significant reduction in adherence to caco- <dig> cells in culture of c. jejuni strains 81– <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . results from our assays were quite similar to these studies, showing a  <dig>  to  <dig>  log reduction in adherence of the isolate without the cjie1-family prophage .

the presence of the prophage therefore makes a substantial contribution to the adherence of the lysogenized bacterium. though the trend to much higher adherence by isolates carrying the prophage was clear in all experiments, the differences in the adherence of isolates with and without the prophage did not reach statistical significance. this was likely partly due to the inter-experimental variability in the adherence and invasion assays, which has been noted before  <cit>  and appears to be a characteristic of the assay. differences in adherence in vivo can be very significant even when cell culture assays demonstrate no difference between strains  <cit> . it is critically important that the role of the prophage be assessed in a relevant animal model and with functional mutagenesis studies.

invasion of caco- <dig> cells was reduced in tlya mutants to 56% and 31% of wild-type in c. jejuni strains 81– <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the 16- to 21-fold difference in invasion detected in the isolates with and without the cjie1-family prophage was similar to this but much less than the 50-fold reduction in invasion of int- <dig> cells resulting from an insertion mutation of cj <dig>  <cit> . however, the cj <dig> mutant also resulted in a motility defect, which is known to have profound effects on invasion  <cit> . in contrast, no gross alterations in motility were seen in c. jejuni isolates with and without the prophage in the present study. the relative numbers of invaded bacteria expressed as a percentage of those adherent at  <dig> min post-inoculation was higher than seen by christensen et al.  <cit> . however, the differences between adherence and invasion of bacteria with and without the cjie1-family prophage were consistent in all experiments, suggesting that whatever technical differences resulted in the higher %i/a values were also consistent. the measurable differences in adherence and invasion associated with prophage carriage found in this study appear to be substantiated. of note, both strain 81– <dig> and 00– <dig> had differences in adherence that were statistically significant when compared with isolate 00– <dig>  furthermore, the levels of adherence and invasion expressed as percentage of input or inoculum counts was very similar to that found in other studies  <cit> .

dna sequencing of the cjie1- <dig> prophage from isolate 00– <dig>  <cit>  has demonstrated the presence of a few genes associated with the prophage that are likely not important for prophage structure, life cycle, or replication, ie. that appear to be cargo genes, in addition to a number of hypothetical proteins. among the putative cargo genes are: the cje <dig> homolog, a dam methylase; orf <dig>  a kap family p loop domain protein; a cje <dig> homolog, dns, an extracellular dnase; orfs  <dig> and  <dig> inserted in the early region of the prophage with no homology to any protein of known function within genbank. we speculate that the effects of the cjie1- <dig> prophage on cells in culture are mediated either by a novel effector or by a regulator of virulence genes or even general metabolism within the c. jejuni bacterial cell. differences in protein expression between isolates with and without cjie <dig> in itraq experiments support this hypothesis .

no consistent or statistically significant differences in motility were found when comparing isolates with and without the prophage. the differences in adherence and invasion were therefore not directly the result of differences in motility, and were also not likely to be due to differences in gene content, other than the previously noted prophage genes, or growth rate.

the four isolates used were all obtained at the same time and in the same place during an outbreak of disease. they were the same subtype and had indistinguishable gene content as measured by comparative genomic hybridization dna microarray analysis except for the fact that isolate 00– <dig> lacked the cjie1-family prophage. though a consistent difference in growth rate was seen during mid-logarithmic phase between the isolate lacking the prophage and the three isolates carrying the prophage, this difference was extremely subtle. it does not seem likely that this degree of difference could be responsible for the differences seen in adherence and invasion.

it must be noted that the combination of microarray data and calculation of genome sizes does not prove absolutely that the four isolates have identical dna sequences other than the presence or absence of cjie <dig>  because the microarray had probes for genes from only two strains it is possible that other genes or dna segments could be present. however, calculation of genome sizes from pfge fragments sizes was done previously with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and the resulting data indicate that genomes of the isolates 00– <dig> and 00– <dig> carrying cjie <dig> differed from 00– <dig>  which lacked cjie <dig>  by  <dig> kb  <cit> . this constrains the variability that would be expected for the four genomes mainly to the presence or absence of the prophage and to dna sequence changes arising from horizontal gene transfer. the use of three different, closely related isolates carrying the cjie <dig> prophage at different places in the genome  should minimize the chances that differences arising from proximity of the prophage to specific genes, from point mutations, and from horizontal gene transfer. whole genome sequencing of these isolates is planned for the near future and should provide unambiguous data regarding gene content and prophage location.

an unexpected observation unrelated to the investigation into prophages came from conducting growth curve experiments with c. jejuni for the first time. very similar od <dig> values were obtained for all four test strains after  <dig> h  growth in initial experiments suggesting that, if differences existed between isolates, they were both quite subtle and quite growth phase-specific. note that these subtle effects were visualized as occurring in mid-log phase  as measured by plating growing cultures, and would likely not have been observed if growth were measured using spectrophotometry, as growth was not detectable at od <dig> until cell density was between 5 ×  <dig> to 1 ×  <dig> cfu/ml .

molecular typing data and information about patient symptoms were available for a relatively large number of human and non-human isolates obtained through the c-enternet sentinel site surveillance system. though there appeared to be some association of orf <dig> with bloody diarrhea and hospitalization, this did not attain statistical significance. a further, somewhat puzzling, observation was that the presence in c. jejuni of cjie <dig> in the absence of orf <dig> appeared to reduce the frequency of some symptoms . this was statistically significant for abdominal pain and fever, though caution should be used in interpretation of the statistical analysis because only a relatively small number of isolates fit into this category. it should be noted that not all patients for which isolates were available filled out questionnaires, and isolates were not available for all patients who filled out questionnaires. it would be of interest to add to the observations in this study over time and determine whether any of the apparent trends are supported by further data.

carriage of both the prophage and of orf <dig> was less frequent in most c. jejuni isolates from water, suggesting these elements do not have adaptive value for the organism in this environment. further research is required to verify this observation and to determine whether this is associated with the biology of the organism or purely stochastic in nature. differences in the proportion of isolates with and without the cjie <dig> prophage between c. jejuni isolates from chicken, human, and bovine sources were either slightly statistically significant  or not significant . there is no strong evidence that the prophage or orf <dig> play a role in host adaptation or host specificity.

a striking difference in the frequency of carriage of both cjie <dig> alone and of cjie1 + orf <dig> in both sts and in flaa svr types suggests that the carriage of these elements may be specific to certain campylobacter lineages, groups, or clones. prophage cjie1 + orf <dig> was found at higher frequency in st  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  sts  <dig> and  <dig> differ only by a single allele and st  <dig> is included with st  <dig> in clonal complex  <dig>  while st  <dig> differs at three alleles from st  <dig> and four alleles from st  <dig>  similarly, cjie <dig> alone is found at higher frequency in st  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and a few other sts, while it is found in much lower frequency in st  <dig> and several additional sts . one possibility is that the carriage and transmission of the cjie <dig> prophage may be strongly associated with a specific animal host or environmental niche. mlst types exhibit a host-specific signature of alleles acquired through homologous recombination during carriage and adaptation of campylobacter within the host species  <cit> . studies in finland indicate that the st- <dig> clonal complex is significantly associated with chicken isolates, while the st- <dig> and st- <dig> clonal complexes are significantly associated with human isolates  <cit> . clonal complexes st- <dig> and st- <dig> are also among the lineages that predominate among c. jejuni isolates from cattle  <cit> . together this information might suggest that the cjie <dig> prophage, like the host-specific mlst alleles, may be circulating in a subset of c. jejuni more closely associated with humans and cattle than with chickens. this finding supports the conclusions of pittenger et al.  <cit> , who determined that c. jejuni rm <dig> variable genes – most of them of prophage origin – were more widely distributed in isolates from cattle and humans than from other sources. however, for cjie <dig> it was apparent from the results presented in table  <dig> that the prophage was present in a greater proportion of c. jejuni from chickens and swine manure than any other sources, though the number of isolates obtained from swine manure do not allow much confidence in that result. a great deal more research into the association of prophages and cargo genes carried by prophage elements is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of cjie <dig> prophages affected both adherence and invasion of the lysogenized bacterium; these effects on adherence and invasion were not due to differences in motility or growth. they also did not appear to result from minor differences in the gene content of the isolates as evaluated by microarray analysis. it is therefore most likely that the prophage, or some gene or genes within the prophage such as orf <dig>  was responsible for the increased levels of both adherence and invasion. there was no strong evidence that the prophage or orf <dig> play a role in host adaptation, host specificity, or human pathogenicity. research into the effects of the prophage on protein expression is expected to provide additional insights into the roles the prophage may play in the biology of its host bacterium.
