BACKGROUND
edible dry bean or common bean  is one of the most highly cultivated legumes, and is a primary source of dietary protein, fiber and vitamins in developing nations. in  <dig>   <dig>  million tonnes of edible dry bean were produced worldwide with the highest cultivation occurring in india, myanmar, brazil, united states and mexico  <cit> . there is evidence for two centers of domestication for p. vulgaris, specifically that of small seeded beans in mexico  and large seeded beans in the south american andes  <cit> . although, andean cultivars  are genetically distinct from mesoamerican cultivars   <cit> , both are susceptible to postharvest-related seed coat darkening  <cit> .

at harvest, cranberry beans are characterized by the presence of red-coloured mottling on a cream coloured seed coat. the light background colour is transformed into a beige/brown colour with postharvest handling  <cit> . similarly, the beige background of pinto beans is susceptible to postharvest darkening . typically, seed coat darkening is promoted by light, humidity, atmospheric o <dig>  and high temperatures during storage, as well as high moisture content in seeds  <cit> . in pinto bean, postharvest-related seed coat darkening is controlled by the presence of one dominant j allele, whereas seeds of homozygous recessive  plants do not darken  <cit> . control of postharvest-related seed darkening is an economically important issue as it is one of the factors that can lead to reduced quality and an overall lower grade for the dry bean market  <cit> . in addition, darkened seed coats tends to be associated with a hard-to-cook trait  <cit> . to date, the biochemical and molecular factors underlying the darkening of cranberry beans during postharvest storage remain unknown.

in legume seeds, proanthocyanidins accumulate within the endothelium of the seed coat  <cit> . their oxidation to reactive quinones promotes an interaction with proteins, culminating in brown deposits within this cell layer, including in pinto bean cultivars that are susceptible to seed coat darkening  <cit> . thus, seed coat darkening in legumes  is associated with the availability of proanthocyanidins, and similar phenomena occur amongst members of the brassicaceae, including the model plant arabidopsis thaliana . proanthocyanidins  are oligomers or polymers of flavan-3-ols  which are derived from the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  . proanthocyanidin metabolism is well described for medicago truncatula, vitis vinifera and arabidopsis. moreover, the availability of a number of arabidopsis pale seed or transparent testa  mutants has facilitated the elucidation of structural and regulatory steps that are functionally relevant for this pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, proanthocyanidin biosynthesis gene transcripts are co-ordinately regulated and accumulate with seed development, reaching maximal levels at the mid to late torpedo stage of embryogenesis  <cit> . by contrast, gene expression for this pathway is highest at early stages of pea seed development, and in advance of proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats  <cit> .fig.  <dig> proposed model of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway in cranberry bean seed coats. the proposed biosynthetic genes are based on information that is available for arabidopsis and m. truncatula . structures corresponding to underlined anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and proanthocyanidins are based on hplc-ms metabolite data described by chen et al.  <cit> . gene abbreviations include: anr, anthocyanidin reductase; ans, anthocyanidin synthase; agt, uridine diphosphate-glucose: anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase; chs, chalcone synthase; chi, chalcone isomerase; c4h, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4cl, 4-coumaroyl:coenzyme a ligase; dfr, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; f3′h, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; f3h, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; lar, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; pal, phenylalanine ammonia lyase





proanthocyanidins are metabolically derived from phenylalanine in a series of steps catalysed by enzymes encoded by early biosynthesis genes; specifically: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, 4-coumaroyl: coenzyme a ligase, chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase  and flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase . it is worth mentioning that the first three enzymes provide precursors for all phenylpropanoids, including flavonoids such as flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins . proanthocyanidin formation is dependent upon the expression of late biosynthesis genes, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , leucoanthocyanidin reductase , anthocyanidin synthase
 and anthocyanidin reductase  . the conversion of flavanones to flavan-3-ols begins with the dfr-mediated stereospecific reduction of dihydroflavonols to leucoanthocyanidins and their subsequent reduction by lar . leucoanthocyanidins are converted to anthocyanidins by ans  <cit> . thereafter, anthocyanidins can be reduced to flavan-3-ols, such as epicatechin in the presence of anr  <cit> . in arabidopsis and m. truncatula, proanthocyanidin accumulation and seed coat darkening are also dependent upon the presence of multidrug and toxic extrusion  transporters, which are involved in atp-dependent transport of epicatechin 3′-o-β-glucoside across the vacuolar tonoplast  <cit> . these late proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes are positively regulated by a myeloblastosis proto-oncogene -basic helix-loop-helix -wd <dig> repeat transcription factor complex in seeds, leaves, flowers and fruits; in addition, mybs are distinguished on the basis of whether their activity activates or represses transcription of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes . it is postulated that free flavan-3-ols are condensed into proanthocyanidin oligomers/polymers by hitherto unknown enzymes, which are subsequently oxidized  <cit> .

the genome of a p. vulgaris andean landrace, g <dig>  was recently sequenced, and its annotation was facilitated by rna-sequencing  data  <cit> . rna-seq overcomes the limitations encountered in traditional transcriptome approaches  as it is capable of detecting low-abundance transcripts  <cit> . moreover, the availability of this newly released genome enabled the identification of tissue-specific transcript abundance patterns in developing dry bean plants, as well as those challenged by a fungal pathogen  <cit> . recently, research by our group determined that proanthocyanidin b dimers and a c-type trimer, as well as their precursors, catechin and epicatechin, are present at high concentrations in the seed coats of fully mature cranberry beans with known susceptibility to postharvest darkening  <cit> . by contrast the levels of these metabolites are very low in non-darkening seeds. together, these metabolite profiles suggest the proanthocyanidin pathway is functional in seed coats of darkening cranberry bean seeds and absent in non-darkening seeds . in the present study, rna-seq analysis was used to monitor global transcript abundance profiles in seed coats of darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean recombinant inbred lines  at three developmental stages in order to test the hypothesis that the accumulation of proanthocyanidins in seed coats of postharvest-darkening susceptible cranberry beans is associated with increased expression of proanthocyanidin metabolism genes.

RESULTS
morphological and proanthocyanidin phenotypes in the seed coats of cranberry bean rils
rils were generated from a cross between the postharvest darkening-susceptible cranberry bean ‘etna’ and the non-darkening cranberry-like bean, ‘wit-rood boontje’, and herein are referred to as darkening and non-darkening rils. a qualitative analysis confirmed that a darkening of the seed coat background occurred in beans collected from mature pods of the darkening ril following storage under greenhouse conditions for 22 days . during the same period, there was no change in the seed coat colour background of mature beans sampled from non-darkening ril plants. similarly, these visual phenotypes were apparent in seeds left at 4 °c for 48 months . these aged seeds were incubated with 4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde , which interacts with proanthocyanidin terminal units and/or their monomeric precursors in plant tissues  <cit> . thereafter, staining was evident in seeds of the darkening ril, indicating the presence of proanthocyanidins and their related metabolites . no staining was evident in aged seeds of the non-darkening ril.fig.  <dig> effect of postharvest storage on seed coat quality of darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean rils. for both rils, mature cranberry beans were maintained under  greenhouse conditions for  <dig> d or  in a sealed plastic bag at 4 °c for 48 months  dmaca staining of aged seeds from both rils as described under methods. scale bar represents 2 cm




previously, we determined that high levels of proanthocyanidins and their precursors are present in mature bean seed coats of the darkening ril, but otherwise absent in the non-darkening ril seed coats  <cit> . the aforementioned study did not analyze proanthocyanidin content in seed coats of immature beans. here, the levels of total extractable proanthocyanidins were measured in the seed coat of both cranberry bean rils as a function of seed development. this assessment was based on a simple spectrophotometric assay following the incubation of seed coat extracts with acidified dmaca to yield a chromophore having a maximum absorbance at 640 nm  <cit> . total extractable proanthocyanidin levels in cranberry bean seed coats were quantified by comparison to a known range of authentic procyanidin a <dig> dimer standard  <cit> . flavan-3-ol standards were not chosen for this comparison as there is a precedent for underestimating proanthocyanidin concentrations  <cit> . in the darkening cranberry bean ril, the levels of these metabolites in seed coats of intermediate stage seeds were approximately 2-fold that of the early stage seed coats . the levels of these metabolites remained unchanged thereafter. by contrast, total extractable proanthocyanidin levels were negligible in seed coats of non-darkening cranberry bean ril, regardless of seed developmental stage.fig.  <dig> seed coat proanthocyanidin levels in developing cranberry beans. total extractable proanthocyanidin levels were determined in seed coats isolated from darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean rils at early, intermediate and mature stages of bean seed development. total extractable proanthocyanidin levels are expressed as procyanidin a <dig> equivalents as described under methods. each datum represents the mean ± standard error of three greenhouse replicates. the proanthocyanidin level data were analyzed for statistical differences with a one-way analysis of variance; for both rils and their developmental stages, means were compared with the tukey’s test. shared letters indicate no significant differences at p ≤  <dig> 




analysis of the seed coat transcriptome
rna-seq analysis was used to evaluate whether changes in the seed coat transcriptome were associated with proanthocyanidin levels as a function of seed development in cranberry beans. for maximal read depth, all cdna libraries were prepared following rrna depletion, as it is known that this highly abundant rna strongly interferes with many rna-seq platforms  <cit> . the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform was used to generate paired-end reads for  <dig> seed coat cdna libraries, representing three greenhouse replicates of both cranberry bean rils at early, intermediate and mature stages of seed development. for libraries of both rils at all three developmental stages, the average number of raw sequence reads of 101 bp length ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> million . the quality trimming procedure generated a total of  <dig>  m reads for all  <dig> seed coat libraries. bowtie <dig> and tophat mapped approximately 95% of these reads to the p. vulgaris g <dig> reference genome   <cit> . the analysis revealed that  <dig> % of the total mapped reads aligned to more than one location in the reference genome. cufflinks was used to estimate the abundance of ambiguous reads in each biological replicate, including splice variants  <cit> , and this approach yielded an average of  <dig>  transcripts across all biological replicates. the original estimation of protein coding loci in p. vulgaris was  <dig>   <cit> , whereas  <dig>  genes are projected in the phaseolus vulgaris gene expression atlas  <cit> . gene counts for all seed coat libraries were normalized in cuffnorm, yielding an average of  <dig>  genes. transcript levels  are provided for all  <dig> seed coat libraries, including those genes annotated to the p. vulgaris genome .table  <dig> metrics for cranberry bean seed coat transcripts generated by illumina sequencing

for each ril developmental stage, data represents the mean ± percent standard error  of three greenhouse replicates.




differential gene expression analysis
a total of  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between darkening and non-darkening seed coats with a relative expression ratio of ≥ <dig> , a p value ≤ <dig>  and non-zero raw read counts for one or more cdna libraries. moreover, a comparison of developmental stage-specific cdna libraries revealed genes were differentially expressed between the rils at early, intermediate and mature stages of seed coat development . the differentially expressed genes for each developmental stage were classified into two groups: genes up-regulated in darkening ril seed coats and genes up-regulated in non-darkening ril seed coats . of these, the largest number of differentially expressed genes was apparent at the mature stage of development, with 64% of these upregulated in the darkening ril seed coats, and the remainder were upregulated in the non-darkening ril . it is worth mentioning that  <dig> genes were upregulated in darkening ril seed coats, regardless of developmental stage . by contrast,  <dig> genes were upregulated in the non-darkening ril seed coats in all three stages analyzed . in addition, in both rils there was evidence for genes upregulated in two of the three stages analyzed . for example,  <dig> genes were upregulated in seed coats at both early and intermediate stages in the darkening ril relative to the non-darkening ril, but unaffected at the mature stage. we determined that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in a stage-specific manner in both darkening and non-darkening rils . the remainder and bulk of the differentially expressed genes were upregulated solely at one developmental stage.table  <dig> summary of differentially expressed genes between darkening and non-darkening ril seed coats at each developmental stage




using model clustering techniques, the differentially expressed seed coat genes were clustered into  <dig> groups; the number of genes per cluster ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . for all clustered genes, their expression patterns across seed maturation stages were visualized after normalization of the raw read counts to fpkm . genes belonging to cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> displayed the highest transcript abundance at the early stage, whereas transcript levels were greatest at the intermediate stage in clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  moreover, cluster  <dig> genes were more highly expressed in the darkening ril relative to the dramatically lower transcript levels in the non-darkening ril. a similar expression profile pattern was apparent for various genes from cluster  <dig>  transcript levels were maximal at the mature stage for genes belonging to clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  gene ontology  enrichment analysis revealed that  <dig> differentially expressed genes belonging to clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were associated with biological processes, which included metabolic processes related to amino acids, amines, lipids, organic acids, redox processes and small molecules . in addition, the go enrichment analysis identified  <dig> genes belonging to cluster  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were categorized as  <dig> separate molecular function go terms, ranging from catalytic activity, hydrolase activity, and metal ion binding. no significant go terms were associated with genes belonging to cluster  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 11– <dig> fig.  <dig> clustering of differentially expressed seed coat genes in darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean rils. for the  <dig> gene clusters, expression patterns demonstrate seed development and/or ril-specific expression patterns. for each cluster, the transcript levels for individual genes  are given in fpkm at early , intermediate  and mature  stages of development for the darkening and non-darkening rils


fig.  <dig> go enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes subjected to a clustering analysis




the go enrichment analysis identified several genes belonging to cluster  <dig> as biosynthetic genes . upon further examination, it was determined that many of these genes were annotated as flavonoid/proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes in the p. vulgaris genome. furthermore, these were classified here on the basis of their similarity at the amino acid level to known structural and regulatory proanthocyanidin pathway genes from other plants, such as arabidopsis, m. truncatula, glycine max and vitis species. thus we identified changes in their respective seed coat transcript levels as a function of seed development . the late proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes, pvf3h <dig>  pvdfr <dig>  pvlar, pvans and pvanr <dig> were expressed at all stages of seed maturation in the darkening cranberry bean ril. the highest transcript levels were detected in cdna libraries prepared from seed coats of intermediate stage beans. thereafter, a decline in transcript abundance was apparent at the mature stage for all three genes. conversely, transcript levels were very low in seed coats of the non-darkening ril, regardless of developmental stage. a second dfr gene, pvdfr <dig>  was also identified, but transcript levels were not different in early and intermediate stage seed coats. in addition, pvdfr <dig> transcript levels in darkening beans were  <dig> to 32% lower than those apparent for pvdfr <dig>  similar transcript profile patterns were apparent for the late biosynthesis gene pvans. for early biosynthesis genes , transcript abundance levels in the darkening ril were comparatively lower than the aforementioned genes, although for the most part expression peaked at the intermediate stage. a number of genes were annotated as proanthocyanidin pathway transporters  and transcription factors . in general, their respective transcript levels peaked at the intermediate stage and were as much as two orders of magnitude lower than that of the late biosynthesis structural genes in the darkening ril, although  <dig>  to  <dig> times greater than the non-darkening ril. genes annotated as bhlh and wd <dig> repeat transcription factors were also upregulated in the darkening ril, although none of the bhlh candidates belonged to cluster  <dig> .fig.  <dig> proanthocyanidin pathway gene expression in seed coats of darkening and non-darkening cranberry beans. transcript levels for each gene are shown for seed coats isolated from seeds of both rils at early , intermediate  and mature  stages of development, and are expressed as fpkm. each datum represents the mean ± standard error of three greenhouse replicates. transcript level data for each gene were analyzed for statistical differences with a one-way analysis of variance; for both rils and their developmental stages, means were compared with the tukey’s test. shared letters indicate no significant differences at p ≤ . <dig>  for each gene transcript, the corresponding gene accession number is provided in brackets: pvpal <dig>  phenylalanine ammonia lyase  <dig> ; pvc4h, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase ; pv4cl <dig>  4-coumaroyl:coenzyme a ligase  <dig> ; pvchs <dig>  chalcone synthase  <dig> ; pvchi <dig>  chalcone isomerase  <dig> ; pvf3′h, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase ; pvf3h <dig>  flavanone 3-hydroxylase  <dig> ; pvdfr <dig>  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  <dig> ; pvdfr <dig>  dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  <dig> ; pvlar, leucoanthocyanidin reductase ; pvans, anthocyanidin synthase ; pvanr <dig>  anthocyanidin reductase  <dig> ; pvagt, uridine diphosphate-glucose: anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase ; pvmyb <dig>  myeloblastosis proto-oncogene  <dig> ; pvmyb <dig>  myeloblastosis proto-oncogene  <dig> ; pvmyb <dig>  myeloblastosis proto-oncogene  <dig> ; pvmate <dig>  multidrug and toxin extrusion  <dig> ; pvmate <dig>  multidrug and toxin extrusion  <dig> 




a comparison of in silico translations of all differentially expressed pvmybs with amino acid sequences of known mybs from other plant species revealed pvmyb <dig> and pvmyb <dig> were phylogenetically similar to mybs from other plant species that are known to positively regulate proanthocyanidin biosynthesis gene expression . moreover, pvmyb <dig> and pvmyb <dig> were well separated from clades containing r2r3-mybs that negatively regulate proanthocyanidin/anthocyanin biosynthesis in various plant species. none of the differentially expressed pvmybs clustered with mybs known to activate the biosynthesis of flavone/flavonol, or with those involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and seed mucilage production. for all differentially expressed genes identified in this study, a transcription factor binding site  enrichment analysis was performed to determine whether sequences upstream of the transcription start site  contained putative myb and bhlh binding sites similar to those known for arabidopsis and brassica napus proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes  <cit> . the tfbs enrichment analysis revealed the percentage of genes containing myb and bhlh binding sites within regions upstream of the transcription start site were comparable for genes upregulated in the darkening ril versus the non-darkening ril . by contrast, the tfbs analysis revealed a higher percentage of transcription factor binding sites were present in the regions upstream of cluster  <dig> genes relative to the complete list of genes upregulated in darkening cranberry beans.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic comparison of p. vulgaris myb amino acid sequences with known repressor and activator mybs from other plant species. in silico translations of p. vulgaris myb coding sequences corresponding to genes that were differentially expressed between darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean rils were aligned to amino acid sequences of other plant mybs using clustalw . the maximum likelihood method in mega  <dig>  was used to construct the unrooted tree  <cit> . numbers proximal to each node represent the percent support values from the bootstrap analysis using  <dig> iterations. previously characterized mybs are represented in black font, and pvmybs are represented in blue font. genbank™ accession numbers for each myb are provided in parentheses: antirrhinum majus myb mixta, ammyb mixta ; ammyb-rosea <dig> ; ammyb-venosa ; arabidopsis thaliana myb <dig>  atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; atmyb <dig> ; diospyros kaki myb <dig>  dkmyb <dig> ; dkmyb <dig> ; epimedium sagittatum myb <dig>  esmyb <dig> ; fragaria x ananassa myb <dig>  famyb <dig> ; famyb <dig> ; gossypium hirsutum myb <dig>  ghmyb1; garcinia mangostana myb <dig>  gmmyb <dig> ; gentiana triflora myb, gtmyb <dig> ; gtmybp <dig> ; leucaena leucocephala myb <dig>  llmyb1; lotus japonicus myb tt2a, ljmyb-tt2a ; ljmyb-tt2b ; ljmyb-tt2c ; malus x domestica myb <dig>  mdmyb <dig> ; medicago truncatula myb, mtmyb ; mtmyb <dig> ; mtmyb <dig> ; mtlap <dig> ; mtlap <dig> ; mtlap <dig> ; mtlap <dig> ; prunus avium myb, pamyb ; picea glauca myb <dig>  pgmyb <dig> ; petunia x hybrida an <dig>  phmyb-an <dig> ; phmyb <dig> ; phmyb <dig> ; phmyb ph <dig> ; phmyb-dpl ; phmyb <dig> ; phmyb-phz  pinus taeda myb <dig>  ptmyb <dig> ; populus tremula x populus tremuloides, ptrmyb <dig> ; solanum lycopersicum myb <dig>  slmyb <dig> ; sorghum bicolor yellow seed <dig>  sb-yellow seed <dig> ; theobroma cacao transparent testa 2-like myb, tcmyb-tt <dig> ; trifolium affine myb <dig>  tamyb <dig> ; trifolium arvense myb <dig>  tarmyb <dig> ; trifolium occidentale myb <dig>  tomyb <dig> ; trifolium repens myb <dig>  trmyb <dig> ; trmyb <dig> ; trmyb <dig> ; trmyb <dig> ; trmyb <dig> ; tr red leaf ; tr red leaf diffusea ; tr red leaf diffuseb ; tr redva ; vitis labrusca x vitis vinifera myba1– <dig>  vlmyba1– <dig> ; vitis vinifera mybpa <dig>  vvmybpa <dig> ; vvmyb4a ; vvmyb5a ; vvmyb5b ; vvmybc <dig> ; vvmybc2-l <dig> ; vvmybc2-l <dig> ; vvmybc2-l <dig> ; vvmyb-pa <dig> ; zea mays myb p <dig>  zmmyb p <dig> . in silico translations of cranberry bean mybs were annotated as pvmyb <dig> to pvmyb <dig> and their corresponding gene accession numbers are provided in parentheses: pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> ; pvmyb <dig> . scale bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitutions per site

in order to assess which of the aforementioned proanthocyanidin pathway genes were most highly associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats of the darkening ril, a principal component analysis  was performed for the transcript abundance profiles of all  <dig> differentially expressed genes. to this end, the normalized gene expression data  for all  <dig> rna-seq libraries were converted into  <dig> uncorrelated variables, herein referred to as principal components . pcs  <dig> to  <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of total variance . in order to determine which of these pcs accounted for proanthocyanidin accumulation within the seed coats of the darkening cranberry bean ril, a correlation analysis was performed. positive correlation coefficients were observed between total proanthocyanidin levels and pcs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , with the largest influence attributable to pc <dig>  the score plots revealed that pc <dig> explained  <dig> % of the total variance, yielding a clear separation of transcript profiles for all three developmental stages. in addition, pc <dig> explained 13% of the total variance, and transcript profiles for the darkening ril were separated from those of the non-darkening ril . to identify which gene transcript levels were associated with the difference in proanthocyanidin levels between darkening and non-darkening rils, a correlation loading plot analysis was implemented for all differentially expressed genes . here, five genes displayed high positive coefficients for both pcs, and were associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation. this included transcript profiles for two genes of unknown function, phvul.006g <dig> and phvul.003g <dig>  in silico translation revealed these encode small proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. in the darkening ril, transcripts for the phvul.003g <dig> gene were greatest at the mature stage of bean development and were  <dig> -fold that of the levels apparent at early and intermediate stages . by comparison, phvul.006g <dig> transcript levels were decreased at the mature stage relative to the immature developmental stages in the darkening ril. in either case, expression of these unknown genes was minimal in seed coats of the non-darkening ril. clustering analyses can identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns; moreover, this information can be used to infer the biological function of unknown genes based on their association with genes of known function  <cit> . phvul.006g <dig> belonged to cluster  <dig> genes, many of which are annotated as flavonoid/proanthocyanidin structural and regulatory genes . a blast search of the non-redundant protein database in ncbi determined that the in silico translation of phvul.006g <dig> has similarity to small proteins of hypothetical function, including an adzuki bean leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein. phvul.003g <dig> belonged to cluster  <dig>  which was comprised of many genes involved in dna binding. interestingly a go enrichment analysis revealed that genes encoding binding proteins  represented the largest group of differentially expressed seed coat genes . apart from these unknown genes, proanthocyanidin accumulation was strongly associated with an increase in transcripts corresponding to the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes pvf3h <dig>  pvdfr <dig>  and pvanr <dig>  pvanr <dig> transcript levels were more strongly associated with proanthocyanidin levels in the darkening ril cranberry bean than pvf3h <dig> and pvdfr <dig> transcript levels .fig.  <dig> relationship between proanthocyanidin levels and gene expression in cranberry bean seed coats. a scree plot of the percentage of total variance explained by each principal component . b correlation matrix of the relationship between seed coat total proanthocyanidin levels and pcs accounting for 95% of the total variance. for each comparison, the strength of the correlation is represented by the corresponding correlation coefficient value. c score plot of pc <dig> versus pc <dig>  biological replicates of darkening and non-darkening ril seed coat are represented by red and green symbols, respectively. dashed circles within the score plot are used to identify grouping of darkening and non-darkening ril seed coat transcriptomes at each developmental stage. d correlation loading plot analysis of pc <dig> versus pc <dig>  scatter dots represent the contribution of each of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes. genes with absolute coefficients greater than  <dig>  for pc <dig> and/or pc <dig> were labelled with their corresponding gene annotation or accession numbers. pv, phaseolus vulgaris;

biochemical properties of a recombinant cranberry bean anr
as part of this study, it was our aim to investigate the biochemical properties of pvanr <dig> due to the strong association between the transcriptional regulation of this putative proanthocyanidin biosynthetic gene and the accumulation of these metabolites in seed coats of the darkening cranberry bean ril. recombinant pvanr <dig> was expressed and purified from escherichia coli. denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting revealed the eluate collected from an immobilized metal affinity chromatography  step contained a single hexahistidine -tagged polypeptide of  <dig>  kda . immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the subsequent incubation with enterokinase removed the his6-tag, yielding a homogenous preparation of a  <dig>  kda polypeptide matching the predicted molecular mass of this protein. for all recombinant protein preparations, approximately 26 ±  <dig> % of the his6-tag free pvanr <dig> was recovered after the enterokinase cleavage step. with this purification strategy, a 6 l bacterial culture yielded an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg of recombinant pvanr <dig> fig.  <dig> biochemical analysis of the recombinant pvanr <dig> enzyme. coomassie brilliant blue stained sds-page  and immunoblot  analysis of the expression and purification of the recombinant pvanr <dig> from e. coli bl <dig> cells. with exception of lanes where corresponding protein amount is indicated, lanes were loaded by equal volume  in a final of 1× sds sample buffer. the immunoblot was subjected to a chromogenic stain following successive probing with an anti-his <dig> antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. abbreviations include: his <dig>  hexahistidine; imac, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; iptg, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; m

a phylogenetic comparison revealed that the pvanr <dig> amino acid sequence is closely related to other legume anrs, including pea and soybean representatives that are expressed in seed coats and utilize cyanidin as a substrate . in vitro pvanr <dig> activity was assessed in the presence of cyanidin, the predominant anthocyanidin occurring in seed coats of the darkening cranberry bean ril  <cit> , and the hydride donor nadph. when pvanr <dig> was incubated with fixed concentrations of nadph and cyanidin at ph  <dig> , hplc-dad analysis revealed the formation of two peaks at retention times  <dig>  and  <dig>  min, which co-migrated with authentic standards of catechin and epicatechin, respectively . there was no evidence of spontaneous formation of these products in assays performed in the absence of pvanr <dig>  the kinetic properties for cyanidin and nadph were established using this hplc-dad based assay . for pvanr <dig>  plots of cyanidin concentration versus the rate of epicatechin and catechin formation did not fit a michaelis-menten relationship. a non-linear regression model determined that the k
 <dig>  and apparent v

seed germination
in order to assess the impact of seed coat proanthocyanidins and darkening on seed germination, we analysed the percentage of aged seeds exhibiting emerged radicles as a function of imbibition time. on average, 26% of non-darkening seeds germinated after  <dig> d, whereas no germinated seeds were observed for the beans of the darkening ril during this period . thereafter, an increase in germination percentage was apparent for both rils, although these proportions were  <dig> and 20% higher in non-darkening relative to darkening seeds on d  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. after  <dig> d, germination percentages were 92% or higher, and not statistically different between seeds of both rils.fig.  <dig> seed germination rates in darkening and non-darkening cranberry beans. for both rils, aged mature cranberry beans were sown on sterile agar plates and incubated at 25 °c under darkness for  <dig> d, as described under methods. for each ril in the experiment, the seed germination percentage was determined daily and represents the number of seeds exhibiting radicle emergence relative to the total number of seeds. each datum represents the mean ± standard error of three separate experiments. the seed germination percentage data were analyzed for statistical differences with a one-way analysis of variance; within each day of the time course, means were compared with the tukey’s test. asterisks are used to indicate significant differences at p ≤  <dig> 




discussion
proanthocyanidins accumulated with development in seed coats of a cranberry bean ril susceptible to postharvest darkening
plant tissues and their derived foodstuffs are the sole source of proanthocyanidins, including baking chocolate, cinnamon, grape seed, sorghum, chokeberries and dry beans  <cit> . moreover, these metabolites exert numerous benefits in humans, including antioxidant and cardioprotective effects  <cit> . unfortunately, the presence of these polyphenolic compounds is associated with darkening in dicotyledonous seed coats . seed coat darkening tends to occur in susceptible legumes, such as faba beans, and certain cultivars of edible dry bean, including pinto and cranberry beans  <cit> . this was also evident in seeds of a cranberry bean darkening ril derived from a cross between the postharvest darkening susceptible parent ‘etna’ and the non-darkening ‘wit-rood boontje’, but otherwise absent in a non-darkening ril . here, we report darkened cranberry beans were dmaca-stained and contained dramatically more total extractable proanthocyanidin levels than its non-darkening counterpart at all stages of seed development . for mature stage seed coats, these trends are in agreement with an hplc-ms analysis of total extractable proanthocyanidin metabolite levels  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that the current study reports an approximately 100% higher level of seed coat proanthocyanidins in mature darkening ril beans relative to our earlier study. quantification in the previous study was based on catechin equivalents; the molecular mass of this compound is 50% that of the procyanidin a <dig> standard employed in fig.  <dig>  moreover, the chromogenic response generated for procyanidin a <dig> in the in vitro dmaca assay is less than that observed for catechin  <cit> . proanthocyanidin levels were greater at the intermediate and mature stages in darkening cranberry bean seed coats. this is not without precedent as proanthocyanidins tend to be largely absent or minimal at early stages of seed development in arabidopsis and pea, but are increased thereafter  <cit> .

proanthocyanidin accumulation in darkening cranberry bean seeds was associated with the co-ordinated upregulation of proanthocyanidin metabolism genes
an rna-seq approach revealed that  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in seed coats of a darkening cranberry bean versus those of a non-darkening genotype. our findings are consistent with a transcriptome analysis of brassica juncea seed coat genes, which reported  <dig> genes are differentially expressed between a brown seed line  and a yellow seed line   <cit> . moreover, the majority of the differentially expressed genes in b. juncea seed coats are not associated with the proanthocyanidin pathway, which is consistent with the majority of the differentially expressed seed coat genes identified in this study .

a myb-bhlh-wd <dig> repeat complex encoded by tt2–tt8–ttg <dig> drives expression of late proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes  in developing arabidopsis seeds  <cit> . in our study, a tfbs analysis of all cluster  <dig> genes  revealed an enrichment in putative myb and bhlh binding sites that match those known for arabidopsis   <cit> . in fact, transcript levels for pvmyb <dig>  pvmyb <dig> and pvmyb <dig> were co-ordinately enhanced in darkening cranberry beans and negligible in the non-darkening genotype . in addition, their expression patterns were correlated with those of proanthocyanidin structural genes . interestingly, pvmyb <dig> and pvmyb <dig> belong to two separate phylogenetic clades containing mybs known to activate expression of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes . all of this information taken together indicates that the transcriptional activation of late proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes is critical for proanthocyanidin content in the seed coats of cranberry beans.

in our study, transcript profiles for three proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes, pvf3h <dig>  pvdfr <dig> and pvanr <dig> were highly associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation . similarly, the expression of anr genes is restricted to proanthocyanidin accumulating-cells in seed coats of b. napus and arabidopsis  <cit> . furthermore, anr expression is well associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats of pea and soybean  <cit> . pvanr <dig> transcript levels were negligible in the seed coat of the non-darkening cranberry bean ril. this finding is consistent with the reduced expression of anr in red-brown soybean seeds, as opposed to the brown seed coat present in cultivars displaying a non-defective anr gene  <cit> . interestingly, the p. vulgaris genome contains a second anr, annotated here as pvanr <dig>  which was phylogenetically similar to a ubiquitously expressed anr <dig> from glycine max  <cit>  . pvanr <dig> transcript levels were dramatically lower than pvanr <dig>  and not differentially expressed in the rna-seq analysis investigated in this study. it is worth mentioning that the pca analysis did not identify pvlar as one of the genes associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation in darkening cranberry beans. this is most likely due to the fact that this gene was expressed at early and intermediate stages in the non-darkening ril, albeit at lower levels than the darkening ril . similarly, lar is expressed in developing m. truncatula seeds, but unlike dfr, ans and anr, its transcript profiles are not well associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation  <cit> . conversely, lar and anr contribute to the respective production of catechin and epicatechin in pea seeds and theobroma cacao  <cit> . thus, the possibility remains that lar contributes to proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in cranberry bean seed coats.

recombinant pvanr <dig> produced catechin and epicatechin
seed coats of mature cranberry beans of the darkening ril contain high levels of catechin and epicatechin, as well as their proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers  <cit> . here, we purified a recombinant pvanr <dig> following its expression in e. coli . the molecular mass of the recombinant pvanr <dig>  is similar to that of gmanr <dig>  <cit> . in vitro biochemical assays revealed that in the presence of the hydride donor nadph, cyanidin was converted into products that co-chromatographed with authentic catechin and epicatechin standards . a kinetic analysis of this enzyme determined that these products were formed with similar catalytic efficiencies . for pvanr <dig>  the apparent v
max for epicatechin formation from cyanidin is within the range of those detected for other anrs  <cit> . similarly, recombinant anrs from arabidopsis, gossypium hirsutum, m. truncatula, vitis bellula and camellia sinensis form both flavan-3-ol products in vitro . moreover, the intrinsic epimerase activity of a v. vinifera anr promotes the stereospecific reduction of cyanidin at the c <dig> and c <dig> positions to form both -epicatechin and -catechin  <cit> . it is unclear as to whether a similar mechanism is apparent for pvanr <dig>  as chiral chromatography was not used in our study. together with the transcriptome analysis, the in vitro biochemistry of the recombinant pvanr <dig> suggests it is a major enzyme involved in the production of proanthocyanidin precursors in cranberry bean, although the possibility remains that lar activity could also contribute to catechin formation in cranberry bean seeds. at concentrations above the apparent k
 <dig>  for cyanidin, pvanr <dig> activity was inhibited by this substrate. this is not without precedent as reduced specific activities are evident for gmanr <dig> at cyanidin concentrations in excess of 100 μm  <cit> . moreover, non-hyperbolic kinetic relationships have been described for a recombinant v. bellula anr enzyme  <cit> . in terms of the biological significance, this could represent a mechanism for feed-forward inhibition of this enzyme as a means of limiting the over-accumulation of proanthocyanidins, and allowing ample substrate for simultaneous anthocyanin formation in cranberry bean seed coats.

seed coat germination was delayed in non-darkening cranberry bean seeds
in darkening cranberry seeds, germination was delayed by  <dig> d and consistently lower over the first  <dig> d of imbibition relative to the non-darkening ril . this is most likely due to the dramatic difference in proanthocyanidin content within the seed coats of these two genotypes. this is in agreement with a report demonstrating that germination is inhibited in arabidopsis and b. napus seeds following the application of exogenous proanthocyanidins  <cit> . in arabidopsis, seed coats that are high in proanthocyanidins promote strong seed dormancy, as these are less permeable to water and promote de novo formation of the growth inhibitor, abscisic acid  <cit> . the accelerated germination capacity in non-darkening cranberry bean seeds was correlated with an absence of proanthocyanidin content in their seed coats, but their impact on hormone-related processes is not known. a putative gibberellic acid-regulated protein gene, phvul.001g <dig>  was negatively associated with proanthocyanidin accumulation in cranberry beans . interestingly, this gene was upregulated in the non-darkening ril . gibberellic acids are plant hormones with numerous biological roles in the plant, including the activation of starch breakdown enzymes in embryonic seed tissues leading to a release from dormancy  <cit> . furthermore, seed coat growth is linked to accumulation of bioactive gibberellic acids, specifically 13-hydroxylated gibberellic acids in these tissues during pea seed maturation  <cit> . phvul.001g <dig> was one of  <dig> genes belonging to cluster  <dig>  which included hormone-related genes that were more upregulated in non-darkening than darkening ril seed coats . biochemical and functional characterization studies of the proteins encoded by these hormone-related genes are required to better understand their respective relevance for seed coat development in non-darkening cranberry beans. as the non-darkening cranberry beans are proanthocyanidin deficient, the possibility remains that hormonal regulation of the dormancy period is varied from that operating in darkening cranberry beans.

CONCLUSIONS
seed coat darkening in dicotyledonous species is dependent upon proanthocyanidin oxidation to reactive quinones . interestingly, this phenomenon is apparent in genotypes with a ready availability of seed coat proanthocyanidins, including the postharvest darkening susceptible cranberry bean ril germplasm investigated in this study. moreover, research on the model plant organisms arabidopsis and m. truncatula has established that proanthocyanidin levels in the seed coat are associated with a fully functional biosynthetic pathway . an rna-seq analysis revealed that nearly 5% of all seed coat genes were differentially expressed between a darkening- and a non-darkening cranberry bean ril, which is consistent with the transcriptomic analysis of seed coats from diversely coloured b. juncea seeds  <cit> . all proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes  were co-ordinately upregulated in the darkening ril, and their seed developmental profiles were consistent with the expression of pvmybs. these phenomena were largely absent in non-darkening cranberry beans. notably, proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats of the darkening susceptible ril was highly associated with the upregulated expression of three proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes, pvf3h1
,
pvdfr <dig>  and pvanr <dig>  like the majority of anrs characterized to date , pvanr <dig> activity was nadph-dependent and catalyzed the formation of epicatechin and catechin from cyanidin. all three of these phenolic compounds are evident in seed coats of darkening cranberry beans, but absent in non-darkening seeds  <cit> . interestingly, pvanr <dig> activity was inhibited by high concentrations of cyanidin. together the findings in this study suggest that:  proanthocyanidin accumulation in cranberry bean seed coats is linked to transcriptional regulation of the proanthocyanidin pathway;  pvanr <dig> serves as the major enzyme for proanthocyanidin formation; and  substrate inhibition of this activity could represent an in vivo control mechanism for limiting proanthocyanidin accumulation. the combined transcriptomic and biochemical information given here is of critical importance for future breeding strategies aimed at limiting darkening in p. vulgaris seeds.
