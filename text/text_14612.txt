BACKGROUND
plant’s ability to perceive and respond to various environmental stresses including too little water , too much salt  and extremes of temperature, depends on appropriate regulation of gene expression. abiotic stress causes both up and down regulation of gene expression  <cit>  . many of the up regulated genes encode proteins that can be classified into two groups: genes coding for the transcription factors and genes encoding proteins involved directly in response mechanisms  <cit> . genes of both classes are controlled at the level of transcription. the molecular mechanisms of specific transcriptional factors that bind to the conserved cis-acting promoter elements in plants are well studied, especially for the abiotic stress-induced up-regulated genes  <cit> . in contrast, mechanisms whereby abiotic stress regulated genes are kept silent in the absence of stress has not been well investigated. to silence gene expression, eukaryotes employ transcriptional repression as a key regulatory mechanism. transcriptional repression plays a critical role in cell fate specification and body patterning in both animals and plants  <cit> . transcriptional activation and repression occur within the context of chromatin organization in eukaryotes. chromatin structure is a governed process often associated with epigenetic regulation, namely, histone post-translational modifications, histone variants and dna methylation that alter chromatin compaction resulting in altered accessibility of genes to transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

transcriptional repression is mediated by an important and extensively studied class of co-repressors, those belonging to the gro/tup <dig> family, including tup <dig> in yeast , groucho  in drosophila, and transducin-like enhancer of split  in mammals. these co-repressor proteins, collectively called the gro/tup <dig> family  <cit> , do not possess direct dna-binding capability. they repress a diverse number of target genes through targeted recruitment to the dna template via protein-protein interactions with a variety of dna-bound transcription factors to mediate repression  <cit> .

the gro/tup <dig> family consists of  <dig> members in arabidopsis, and the functions of only a few have been studied  <cit> . leunig  was the first gro/tup <dig> family member to be characterized in arabidopsis <cit> . the lug protein has lish and lufs domains at the n-terminus, and resembles gro/tup <dig> in having a q-rich and seven wd domains. the lish  domain is a dimerization motif that is present in all plant gro/tup <dig> proteins. the lufs  domain is present only in lug and luh among the gro/tup <dig> family members present in arabidopsis. lufs domain is involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the lufs domain in lug interacts physically with seuss , a q rich protein with a conserved domain that is similar to the dimerization domain of the lim-domain binding  family of transcriptional co-regulators in mouse and drosophila <cit> . seu forms a co-repressor complex with lug and acts as an adapter between lug and a variety of transcription factors to mediate repression of diverse target genes during floral organ identity, floral patterning and abaxial organ identity in leaves  <cit> .

luh is another member of the gro/tup <dig> family and highly similar to lug with 44% identity in arabidopsis <cit> . thus, not surprisingly luh functions redundantly to some extent with lug in abaxial organ identity in leaves and identity of floral organs  <cit> . furthermore, luh interacts with seu in a yeast two hybrid assay suggesting that seu-luh complex could functionally substitute for the seu-lug complex to mediate repression at target gene which may possibly explain the redundant functions  <cit> . in addition, luh also interacts with slk <dig> and slk <dig> and functions redundantly with lug in abaxial organ identity  <cit> . until recently, luh function in addition to its minor role in development was not known. several recent reports indicate that luh plays an important role in regulating pectin structure and mutants lacking luh fail to release mucilage from the seed coat. one relevant target of luh is mum <dig>  a β-galactosidase involved in the modification of the mucilage  <cit> . at present, there are two plausible mechanisms to account for mum <dig> regulation. the first is by luh acting as a direct positive regulator of mum <dig>  the other mechanism involves luh acting as negative regulator of a mum <dig> repressor.

although luh shows significant sequence similarity with lug, the molecular function of luh remains unclear. the only known function of luh is its major role in mucilage secretion in arabidopsis. in this study, we present results indicating involvement of luh in the abiotic stress response. we demonstrate that luh functions as a transcriptional repressor similar to gro/tup <dig> family proteins. additionally, we show that the conserved lufs domain in luh physically interacts with adaptor proteins slk <dig> and slk <dig> which do not show repressor activity themselves. the luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> mutant plants shows elevated salt and osmotic stress tolerance and higher expression levels of abiotic stress responsive gene under non-stress conditions. in addition, luh physically interacts with histone h2b and h <dig> and either directly or indirectly regulates chromatin structure at the abiotic stress responsive genes. these data provide an insight into the novel roles for luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> in abiotic stress response gene regulation and illuminate luh function in chromatin remodeling.

RESULTS
luh- <dig>  slk1- <dig> and slk2- <dig> plants exhibit tolerance to salt and osmotic stress
comparison of expression profiles between lug and luh revealed that both the genes are expressed at comparable levels in all tissues under normal condition. interestingly, luh expression level is elevated in both biotic and abiotic stress in contrast to lug which remained unchanged or reduced  <cit> . since luh expression is enhanced in abiotic stress and interacts with seu  <cit> , we sought to determine whether the luh-seu complex plays a role in abiotic stress. we subjected luh- <dig> and seu- <dig> plants to salt and osmotic stress. plants with mutation in seu showed unchanged tolerance to salt and osmotic stress  that could be attributed to the functional redundancy within the seu family proteins. arabidopsis encodes three seu-like proteins  and these proteins function redundantly with seu in flower development  <cit> . we hypothesized that slk may be involved in the abiotic stress and functions redundantly with seu in flower development, because slk1- <dig> and slk2- <dig> single and double mutants do not show any defect in flower development. to test this, loss of function mutants slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> were examined for altered response to salt and osmotic stress. we observed difference in the root lengths in the single mutants compared to wild type plants when grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl for salt stress and  <dig> mm mannitol for osmotic stress . the root length was longer in the single mutants compared to the wild type plants when grown on ms medium containing  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm mannitol . in addition, the fresh weight of the single mutants were higher compared to the wild type plants when grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm mannitol . interestingly, on ms medium without stress treatment, root length of luh- <dig> and slk1- <dig> mutants was slightly shorter compared to wild type plants due to slower root growth. the differences in the root length between luh- <dig>  slk1- <dig> mutants and wild type plants became negligible with longer periods of incubation on ms medium. the fresh weight of slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig>  and luh- <dig> mutants were comparable to wild type plants when grown on ms medium without stress treatment.

to verify whether the salt and osmotic stress tolerance in slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> is due to loss of function. we transformed the mutants with native gene promoter containing wild type coding sequence. transgenic mutants with wild type coding sequence complemented the salt tolerance phenotype and were similar to wild type plants when grown on ms medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl for salt stress . the root length of complemented mutants were comparable to the wild type plants when grown on medium containing  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm mannitol . in addition, the fresh weight of the complemented mutants were similar to the wild type plants when grown on medium supplemented with  <dig> mm nacl and  <dig> mm mannitol . expression level of slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh gene in the complemented plants were similar to their expression in the wild type plants .

to determine whether the double mutants show enhanced tolerance to the salt and osmotic stress compared to the single mutants, we constructed slk1- <dig> /luh- <dig> and slk2-1/luh- <dig> double mutants. the double mutants did not exhibit significant differences in the root length and fresh weight compared to the single mutants when subjected to salt and osmotic stress . additionally, altered response to the plant hormone abscisic acid  and freezing tolerance  was tested and these responses were unchanged in the single mutants compared to the wild type plants . collectively these data show that loss of function in luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> results in enhanced tolerance to salt and osmotic stress in the single mutants compared to the wild type plants.

slk <dig> and slk <dig> interact with the lufs domain in luh
it has been shown that luh interacts with slk <dig>  slk <dig> and slk <dig> in yeast two hybrid assay  <cit> . our yeast two hybrid assay also showed interaction between luh fused with the gal <dig> dna binding domain  and slk <dig> and slk <dig> fused with the gal <dig> activation domain  . we have previously shown that seu interact with the lufs domain in lug, thus raising the question whether slk <dig> and slk <dig>  interact with the lufs domain in luh  <cit> . indeed, yeast two hybrid analysis indicated that the lufs domain in luh is sufficient for physical interaction with slk <dig> and slk <dig> .

to confirm luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> interactions in plants, we performed split luciferase complementation assays in arabidopsis protoplasts  <cit>  by fusing luciferase n-terminal fragment translationally to full length luh and to the lufs domain alone. the c-terminal fragment was fused to slk <dig> or slk <dig>  in agreement with the yeast two hybrid assays, protoplasts transfected with luh-slk <dig> and luh-slk <dig> plasmids showed elevated levels of luciferase activity compared to vector treated and n-terminal fragment fused with luh alone . the slk <dig> interaction with luh was higher compared to slk <dig>  moreover, slk <dig> and slk <dig> interaction with the lufs domain were as strong as full length luh supporting the idea that the lufs domain is sufficient for interaction with slk <dig> and slk <dig> to form luh-slk <dig> and luh-slk <dig> co-repressor complexes in vivo .

luh has repressor activity
to determine whether luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> could function as transcriptional repressors, a repression assay in arabidopsis protoplasts was performed. the gal <dig> dna binding domain was fused with slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh. the constructs were co-transfected into arabidopsis protoplasts along with a reporter construct 5xuasgal4camv 35s::luc containing 5x gal <dig> binding sites upstream of camv 35s constitutive promoter and the effect on luciferase expression was quantitated . transfection with slk1-bd and slk2-bd alone did not affect the reporter gene expression. in contrast, luh-bd significantly reduced reporter gene expression in a concentration dependent manner, indicating that luh functions as a transcriptional repressor in vivo . to explore the possibility that slk <dig> and slk <dig> may serve as adaptor proteins to aid the interaction between luh and dna-binding transcription factors, as seen for the seu-lug complex  <cit> , slk1-bd or slk2-bd dna was co-transfected with the camv 35s::luh or camv 35s::lufs construct, and effects on reporter expression were quantitated  <cit> . these results revealed that in the presence of luh, slk <dig> or slk <dig> significantly reduced reporter gene expression . in contrast, lufs did not reduce the reporter expression, suggesting that the q-rich and wd domain in the luh is required for the repressor activity . these data indicate that luh has repressor function and confirms the hypothesis that slk <dig> and slk <dig> function as adapter proteins to recruit luh to the promoter to inhibit gene transcription.

co-repressors in the gro/tup <dig> family mediate repression by recruiting histone deacetylases  to the target genes  <cit> . in order to determine whether a similar mechanism is utilized by luh, we performed repression assays in protoplasts in presence of tsa, an inhibitor of hdac activity. interestingly, luh failed to repress the reporter gene in the presence of tsa  indicating that luh employs a highly conserved process that involves recruitment of hdacs to mediate repression at the target loci  <cit> .

since slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh form a co-repressor complex and slk <dig> and slk <dig> have typical nuclear localization signal  in contrast to luh that has atypical nls, we investigated subcellular localization by fusing with gfp and expressing the fusion proteins in arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. as expected, results from fluorescent microscopy indicated that the slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh are nuclear localized . taken together, these results reveal that slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh are present in the nucleus, supporting the idea that they form co-repressor complexes and mediate repression by recruiting hdac to the target genes.

luh negatively regulates abiotic stress response genes
involvement of slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh in salt and osmotic tolerance indicated that abiotic stress response gene expression is altered in these mutants thereby conferring tolerance to the abiotic stress. to identify the genes that are differentially expressed in slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to wild type plants, we performed quantitative rt-pcr for some well-known genes that confer abiotic stress tolerance  <cit>  and compared their expression to actin <dig> gene as an internal control. elevated expression of rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> transcripts was observed in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to wild type plants under non stress conditions . in contrast, expression level of rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> transcripts were comparable to wild type in the complemented plants .

myb <dig> and nac <dig> are transcription factors that are implicated in the regulation of several abiotic stress response genes  <cit> . furthermore, elevated expression of rd <dig> confers abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . these data indicate that the loss of function in slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh results in increased expression of rd <dig>  transcription factors myb <dig> and nac <dig> and could possibly result in the improved tolerance to the abiotic stress in these mutant plants.

luh alters the chromatin state at the abiotic stress response genes
a number of studies indicate that the gro/tup <dig> family of co-repressors present in the repressor complex interacts with histones to regulate gene activity. in yeast, tup <dig> interacts with histone h <dig> and h <dig>  and human tbl <dig> interacts with histone h <dig> and h2b  <cit> . yeast two hybrid assays revealed that luh interacts in a similar manner with the histone h2b and h <dig> . we confirmed this interaction quantitatively using split luciferase complementation assays in arabidopsis protoplasts. the results show that luh interaction with histone h2b is higher compared to histone h <dig> . differences in the histone interaction between luh, tbl <dig> and tup <dig> are not surprising taking into consideration the disparity between these co-repressors at the n-terminal sequences.

since luh interacts with histone h <dig> and h2b and requires hdac for the repressor activity, we examined the histone acetylation level at the target genes that showed elevated expression in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to the wild type plants. it is well established that the histone h <dig> n-terminal tail is acetylated at lys- <dig>  lys- <dig>  lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> positions and these modifications are required for promoting active transcription  <cit> . therefore, we performed chip assays at the first exon of coding region in rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> gene for the histone h <dig> acetylation at lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> positions with respective antibodies . our data shows increased histone h <dig> acetylation level at the first exon in both lys residues in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to wild type plants . we also examined nucleosome density by chip assay at the first exon of coding region with histone h <dig> c-terminal antibodies to determine changes in histone h <dig> levels in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to wild type plants in rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> gene. we found decreased histone h <dig> levels at the first exon of coding region in rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> gene in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to wild type plants . these results are consistent with the understanding that the active gene transcription is associated with reduced nucleosome density  <cit> .

we did not determine the acetylation status in h2b due to the lack of plant specific antibodies. in conclusion, luh interacts with histone h2b and h <dig> and recruits hdac to eliminate the acetylation on histone h <dig> at the positions lys- <dig> and lys- <dig>  furthermore, the presence of luh could increase the nucleosome density resulting in the condensation of the chromatin and hindering the active transcription at the target genes.

discussion
in arabidopsis, lug and topless  are the most studied gro/tup <dig> co-repressors that are implicated in developmental processes and hormone signaling  <cit> . luh is the homolog of lug and plays critical role in mucilage excretion  <cit> . expression profile analysis indicated that the luh is differentially regulated during abiotic stress compared to lug and could play a role in the abiotic stress response  <cit> . surprisingly, hos <dig>  belonging to gro/tup <dig> family, was identified in a forward genetic screen involving abiotic stress response, and loss of function in hos <dig> results in freezing sensitivity  <cit> . these studies prompted us to investigate luh function in abiotic stress response and here we show that luh is indeed involved in abiotic stress response thus broadening the function of luh. loss of function mutation in luh results in plants that are more tolerant to salt and osmotic stress compared to the wild type plants. luh interacts with seu, an adaptor protein that links luh to the transcription factor, and interestingly, seu mutants do not show tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. in arabidopsis, there are three seu like genes  <cit> , and we found that loss of function in slk <dig> and slk <dig> confers salt and osmotic tolerance similar to luh when mutant plants were subjected to the stress conditions. seu, slk <dig> and slk <dig> function redundantly in embryonic development mediated through plant hormone auxin and in the outer integument development in the ovule  <cit> . our results provide a novel function for the slk <dig> and slk <dig> in the abiotic stress response outside their role in the development. double mutant analysis with slk1-1/luh- <dig> and slk2-1/luh- <dig> for salt and osmotic stress indicated that slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh functions in the same genetic pathway. we did not observe differential responses in slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh compared to wild type plants during freezing and plant hormone aba treatment.

genetic analysis indicated that luh function is dependent on slk <dig> and slk <dig>  yeast two hybrid and in planta analyses in protoplasts indicated that the luh interacts with slk <dig> and slk <dig> confirming an earlier study  <cit> . interestingly, lufs domain in luh is sufficient for interaction with slk <dig> and slk <dig> which is similar to the interaction of seu with the lufs domain in lug  <cit> . seu, slk <dig> and slk <dig> are highly similar with a centrally positioned q-rich region containing a ldb1/chip conserved domain  that is likely to interact with the lufs domain  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis indicated that seu is more closely related to slk <dig> than to slk <dig> which could explain the stronger interaction between luh and slk <dig> compared to slk <dig>  <cit> .

the molecular functions of slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh were unknown. our results indicate that only luh has transcriptional repressor activity. interestingly, co-transfection with either slk1-bd or slk2-bd with camv 35s::luh gave repressor activity. these results indicate that slk <dig> and slk <dig> function as adaptors to recruit luh, which serves as the repressor within this complex. a recent study showed that luh functions as an activator in arabidopsis protoplasts in contrast to the repressor function observed in our study  <cit> . one possibility for this observed function of luh could be due to the different reporter systems used in the protoplast assay. in our assay, the reporter has 5x gal sequence upstream of constitutive camv 35s promoter; in contrast, the published study used 4x gal sequence with the reporter gene without constitutive promoter in between 4x gal sequence and the reporter gene  <cit> . in our view, luh functions as the repressor and this is supported by the observation that in the luh mutant, expression of lug which has repressor activity  <cit>  restores the mucilage deficiency phenotype in the luh plants  <cit> . it is possible that in some cellular or developmental contexts luh may function as an activator, although this mode of regulation has little empirical support.

the repressor activity of the luh in protoplasts is eliminated by addition of tsa suggesting that the repression is mediated by recruiting hdac. arabidopsis encodes  <dig> hdacs and plays critical role in development, growth and hormone signaling  <cit> . recent studies indicate that hda <dig> genetically and physically interacts with co-repressors lug and tpl, and has been implicated in flower development  <cit> . our preliminary results indicate that luh does not interact with the hda <dig> and the identity of the hdac that interacts with the luh remains to be established .

to explain the observed salt and osmotic stress tolerance in slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh mutants, we performed quantitative rt-pcr for the abiotic stress response genes that show elevated transcripts level compared to the wild type plants thus contributing to the stress tolerance. our results indicate that rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> genes are expressed at elevated level in these mutants compared to wild type plants. rd <dig> gene is a well known abiotic stress inducible marker and participates in stomatal control and transpiration in arabidopsis thus conferring abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . the myb <dig> gene encodes a r2r <dig> myb domain-containing transcription factor that regulates several salt and drought stress responsive genes  <cit> . nac domain-containing transcription factors are prominent plant specific transcription factors and nac <dig> is one of the  <dig> genes that are encoded in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . nac <dig> gene is induced by salt and dehydration stress, and over expression in the transgenic plants results in the induction of several stress response genes hence conferring abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . interestingly, nac <dig> regulatory region has an myb binding site, and myb <dig> transcription factor binds to the nac <dig> regulatory region in a yeast one hybrid assay  <cit> . however, nac <dig> gene activation by myb <dig> in planta has not been demonstrated.

the three identified target genes are not adequate to explain the observed salt and osmotic stress phenotype in the luh- <dig>  slk1- <dig> and slk2- <dig> mutant plants. therefore, it appears that several positive factor genes are expressed in these mutants compared to wild type plants that confer abiotic tolerance. further studies are required to identify additional target genes.

since slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh lack dna binding domain, the mechanisms of recruitment of slk1-luh and slk2-luh complexes to the regulatory region of rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> genes are unknown. among the possible mechanisms, one could be that slk <dig> and slk <dig> interacts with different sequence specific transcription factor or slk <dig> and slk <dig> form heterodimeric complexes that bridge the transcription factor and luh at the target regulatory region. identification of specific transcription factors that interact with slk <dig> and slk <dig> and in vivo association at the regulatory region would illustrate the precise mechanism of slk1-luh and slk2-luh recruitment to the target genes.

chromatin structure within a gene largely determines its transcriptional state and expression levels and can be changed with modification at the n- terminal tails of histones. one of the key mechanisms in chromatin remodeling is histone acetylation and deacetylation, mediated by the enzymes histone acetyl transferase  and hdac respectively  <cit> . the role of chromatin remodeling is well established in transcriptional gene silencing and in control of flowering response by vernilization in arabidopsis <cit> . recent studies suggest that abiotic stress response gene expression also depends on chromatin remodeling, yet how this distinctive chromatin state is established is not known  <cit> . in addition, the function of gro/tup <dig> family of co-repressors in chromatin remodeling in arabidopsis is not well understood. our results demonstrate that luh interacts with histone h <dig> and h2b. furthermore, the chromatin state is altered at target genes that are expressed at elevated levels. we observed that nucleosome density at target genes rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> that are expressed in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants are reduced compared to the wild type plants. these results are consistent with the observation that higher nucleosome density within a gene inhibits transcription by limiting rna polymerase processivity  <cit> . in plants, histone h <dig> modification at positions lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> is positively correlated with gene activation, and the deacetylated status with inactive transcription  <cit> . our results indicate that histone h <dig> is acetylated at positions lys- <dig> and lys- <dig> on the target genes rd <dig>  myb <dig> and nac <dig> that are highly expressed in the slk1- <dig>  slk2- <dig> and luh- <dig> mutants compared to the wild type plants. these data indicate that luh prevents the expression of target genes by recruiting hdacs that deacetylate histone h <dig> at positions lys- <dig> and lys- <dig>  further studies are needed to establish the presence of luh, slk <dig> and slk <dig> at the regulatory sequence of the target genes to modify the chromatin status.

luh is induced during abiotic stress in contrast to lug suggesting that luh plays an important role in abiotic stress response. interestingly slk <dig> and slk <dig> are induced in response to osmotic stress . there are several possible roles that luh can participate in regulating abiotic stress response in plants. first, during abiotic stress several genes are induced that confer tolerance to the abiotic stress and increased luh expression could form complex with slk1/slk <dig> and negatively regulate genes that are detrimental to the abiotic stress tolerance. second, one of the main mechanisms that plants employ to endure abiotic stress is by reprogramming the developmental pathway so that important growth phases that are sensitive to abiotic stress are delayed  <cit> . the luh-slk <dig> and luh-slk <dig> complexes could repress the genes that are involved in the transition of growth phase. third, luh-slk <dig> and luh-slk <dig> complexes could regulate the abiotic stress pathway by controlling the length or level of response by regulating the positive or negative determinant genes by negative feedback loop.

CONCLUSIONS
slk <dig> and slk <dig> function as adapters to form slk1-luh and slk2-luh complexes with luh possessing repressor activity. how the slk1-luh and slk2-luh complexes are recruited to the promoter of the abiotic stress response genes remains to be determined. luh could exert its repressive effect on the target genes by recruiting histone deacetylase that facilitates deacetylation of histone h <dig> associated with promoter of target genes. the binding of the luh to the histone h <dig> results in the condensation of chromatin and increased nucleosome density, thus preventing gene transcription by rna polymerase at the target genes. further studies are needed to determine the transcription factors that interact with slk <dig> and slk <dig> to recruit luh to the regulatory sequence of target genes. microarray analysis in slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh mutant plants will provide additional insight into the abiotic stress response genes regulated by slk <dig>  slk <dig> and luh.
