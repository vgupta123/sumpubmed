BACKGROUND
the structure of a g-protein-coupled receptor  generally comprises seven Î±-helical transmembrane domains, an extracellular n-terminus, and an intracellular c-terminus  <cit> . gpcrs constitute one of the largest family of membrane proteins, and their main function is to transduce extracellular signals into intracellular reactions. therefore, they play a key role in diverse physiological processes such as neurotransmission, secretion, cellular differentiation, cellular metabolism, and so forth  <cit> . it has been estimated that almost two-thirds of drugs on the market interact with gpcrs  <cit> , which indicates that gpcrs are pharmacologically important. therefore, both academic and industrial researchers are very interested in the studies on gpcrs to understand their structures and functions. unfortunately, the  <dig> d protein structures of gpcrs are largely unavailable  <cit> , except for the gpcr family bovine rhodopsin. although some advanced biotechnologies such as nmr allow to detect the  <dig> d protein structures, their experiments are generally very time-consuming and costly. in contrast, a large number of gpcr primary sequences are known  <cit> . to facilitate the identification and characterization of novel receptors  <cit> , it is therefore very valuable to develop a computational method to predict gpcrs from the protein primary sequences.

based on their binding ligand types, gpcrs are often classified into different groups, some of which are further divided into subgroups, sub-subgroups, etc. the gpcrdb database  <cit>  is one of the most popular database for gpcrs, which organizes gpcrs using a hierarchical structure. as in  <cit> , we call each layer of this hierarchical structure a level. the top layer is then referred to as the second level , and the second layer is referred to as the third level, etc. according to the latest version of the gpcrdb database , gpcrs in the second level are classified into five families or classes ; that is,  class a rhodopsin like,  class b secretin like,  class c metabotropic glutamate/pheromone,  vomeronasal receptors , and  taste receptors t2r. for the first four families above, each is further divided into subfamilies located at the third level. furthermore, located on the fourth and fifth levels of the hierarchical structure are the sub-subfamilies and subtypes, respectively. on the other hand, given a new protein, the first step is to determine whether it is a gpcr or a non-gpcr. therefore, we add one more level on the top of the hierarchical structure of the above classification system. it is referred to as the first level. the complete hierarchical structure of five levels is illustrated in figure  <dig> 

in this paper we will look into the following classification problem, which is referred to as a five-level classification problem. given a protein sequence, we need to determine whether it is a gpcr or a non-gpcr. if it is predicted into a gpcr, we need to further determine which family, subfamily, sub-subfamily, and subtype it belongs to. to tackle this problem, a set of distinct classifiers is generally needed for each level as depicted in figure  <dig>  in the literature, many computational methods have been proposed to predict gpcrs. however, to our best knowledge, there are no methods that can deal with the five-level problem completely, . for example, the methods presented in  <cit>  predict gpcrs just at a single level , and the methods in  <cit>  predict gpcrs only at the third and fourth levels. the prediction methods in  <cit>  and  <cit>  instead considered three and four levels, respectively.

today's academic and industrial researchers are both interested in the functional roles of gpcrs at the finest subtype level. this is mainly because each subtype demonstrates its own characteristic ligand binding property, coupling partners of trimeric g-proteins, and interaction partners of oligomerization  <cit> . therefore, discrimination of functions of a gpcr subtype from the others  becomes very important in the effort to decipher gpcrs. however, we can expect that it is a challenging task that shall not be easier than the prediction of gpcrs at any of the first four levels. fortunately, more and more gpcr sequences are now being accumulated into the gpcrdb database, which makes it possible to accurately predict gpcrs at all the five levels. this is the main goal of our present study.

a lot of related work has been done previously. in general, there are two important components in a classification task -- one is feature extraction and the other is a classification algorithm. feature extraction means how to extract features from protein sequences so that each protein is represented as a fixed-length numerical vector. various methods have been proposed to extract information from protein sequence in the past decades . the commonly-used feature extraction methods are based on amino acid composition  <cit>  and dipeptide composition  <cit> , and more complicated ones include chou's pseudo amino acid composition  <cit> , the cellular automaton image approach  <cit> , profile hidden markov models  <cit> , fast fourier transform  <cit> , wavelet-based time series analysis  <cit> , and fisher score vectors  <cit> . once protein sequences are represented by numerical vectors, any general-purpose classification algorithms can be used for classification, for instance, covariant discriminant  <cit> , nearest neighbor  <cit> , bagging classification tree  <cit> , and support vector machines  <cit> .

in this paper, we focus on predicting gpcrs at the five levels. five groups of descriptors are used to extract information from the amino acid sequences. these five groups are  amino acid composition and dipeptide composition,  autocorrelation descriptors,  global descriptors,  sequence-order descriptors, and  chou's pseudo amino acid composition descriptors. these descriptors reflect various physicochemical properties of proteins and have been adopted to predict many other protein attributes, such as protein subcellular localization  <cit> , outer membrane protein  <cit> , nuclear receptors  <cit> , and protein structural classes  <cit> . by combining these descriptors, a comprehensive set of  <dig> features are calculated for each amino acid sequence. by applying the principal component analysis on a dataset, we then reduce them to a set of  <dig> features that could retain as much of the data variability as possible.

finally, a simple yet powerful algorithm called intimate sorting is employed to predict gpcrs, and the experimental tests on the benchmark datasets show that the classifications can be improved. jackknife test shows that the overall accuracies of the proposed method at the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth levels achieve up to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. comparisons with several existing methods show that the proposed method achieves higher prediction performance consistently.

RESULTS
predicting gpcr at five levels
for simplicity, we call the proposed method pca-gpcr. pca-gpcr preforms the prediction at five levels, and its flowchart structure is depicted in figure  <dig>  by the first-level classifier a new protein sequence is predicted to be either a gpcr or a non-gpcr. if it is predicted to be a gpcr, it will be further classified into one of the four families, which is done by the second-level classifier. the third-level classifiers hence determine which subfamily the protein belongs to. for some subfamilies , the fourth-level classifiers are used to determine the sub-subfamily of the protein. finally, the fifth-level classifiers determine the subtypes of the protein, if any . we carried out the experiments on the collection of datasets gdfl . jackknife tests show that the overall accuracies of pca-gpcr are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for the five levels, respectively. the details of experimental results are presented in the additional file  <dig>  it is commonly believed that, the smaller number of training sequences, the less reliable a classifier to be trained. therefore, it is not surprising to see that the prediction accuracies are higher at the first and second levels and relatively lower at the third and fourth levels. on the other hand, to filter out high-homology sequences, we used cd-hit with a less stringent threshold  for the fifth level than the one for any other levels, which results in a larger number of training sequences for the fifth level. this might partly explain why the accuracy achieved for the fifth level  is higher than those of the second, third and fourth levels. for the convenience of public use, a web server was already developed, which is freely available at http://www <dig> spms.ntu.edu.sg/~chenxin/pca_gpcr.

comparison with blast-based classification
the most straightforward method for predicting gpcrs might be based on homology search by sequence alignment tools such as blast and psi-blast  <cit> . a given gpcr sequence is hence predicted into the class to which its most similar gpcr sequence belongs. however, as the pairwise sequence similarities get lower, such an alignment-based method would rarely yield satisfactory predictions. for instance, when applied to the dataset gdfl for the prediction at the first level, the blast-based method achieved the overall accuracy of  <dig> %, which is  <dig> % lower than that from pca-gpcr. note that pca-gpcr is instead an alignment-free method. the above experimental results therefore show that an alignment-free method is very promising in the high accurate prediction of gpcr classes.

comparison with previous methods
in order to demonstrate the superior performance of pca-gpcr, we make comparisons with a number of previous methods. depending on the predictive capability of previous methods, the comparisons are made at a single level and at the first two levels, as follows.

comparison at a single level
because many previous methods predicted gpcr at a single level  <cit> , we also predict gpcr at just one level in order to compare with them fairly. three benchmark datasets that contain a proportion of high-homology sequence pairs, d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  are used here . the first two datasets comprise gpcrs from the fourth level, and the last one is composed of gpcrs from the second level. the resulting prediction accuracies for these datasets are listed in table  <dig>  we can see that the overall accuracies for three datasets are all above 97%. to be specific, the overall accuracies of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % are achieved for the datasets d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig>  respectively. they are slightly higher than the accuracies reported in refs.  <cit> . indeed, the prediction accuracies for individual families or sub-subfamilies are all very high and, in some cases, have reached 100% or nearly 100%.

tot is the number of sequences observed in class i, c is the number of correctly predicted sequences of class i, and acc is the prediction accuracy.

because the dataset d <dig> has been widely used to test various methods, it is adopted here for further detailed comparisons with the other five methods  <cit> . the experimental results are presented in table  <dig>  it is evident from the table that our method achieved the highest overall prediction accuracy. our method performs better than any other tested methods in the predictions of the gpcr sub-subfamilies except for the sub-subfamily serotonin.

the results of the other methods are taken directly from the corresponding references.

comparison with gpcr-ca at the first two levels
we further compare our method with gpcr-ca  <cit>  on the dataset d <dig>  which comprises gpcrs from the second level. unlike the datasets tested in the above subsection, d <dig> contains almost no high-homology sequence pairs. note that the gpcr-ca is able to predict gpcrs at the first two levels.

the prediction accuracies of both gpcr-ca and pca-gpcr at the first and second levels are listed in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. at the first level, to distinguish gpcrs from non-gpcrs, our method achieves the overall accuracy of  <dig> %, which is  <dig> % higher than that of gpcr-ca. at the second level, the overall accuracy of our method improves over gpcr-ca by  <dig> %. meanwhile, according to the prediction accuracies of individual families, our method performs much better than gpcr-ca except for the rhodopsin-like family. it is also noticeable that a substantial improvement of  <dig> %  has been made for the prediction of the fungal pheromone family .

the results of gpcr-ca are directly taken from the ref.  <cit> .

the results of gpcr-ca are directly taken from the ref.  <cit> .

gpcr-ca extracts  <dig> features, including  <dig> features from amino acid composition and four features from cellular automaton image  <cit> . while the last four features were reported to be able to reveal the protein's overall sequence patterns, only four features might not suffice to reveal overall sequence patterns completely. on the contrary, our method explores the amino acid sequences comprehensively to gain as much information from the protein primary sequences as possible. both the amino acid composition and the dipeptide composition are utilized in our method and, moreover, the important sequence-order information and a variety of physicochemical properties of amino acids are carefully explored as well. we believe that it is this comprehensive set of features that lead our method to a higher prediction accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have proposed a new method called pca-gpcr to predict gpcrs at five levels. in this method, a comprehensive set of  <dig> sequence-derived features are generated from five groups of descriptors -- that is, amino acid composition and dipeptide composition, autocorrelation descriptors, global descriptors, sequence-order descriptors, and chou's pseudo amino acid composition descriptors. these features are able to capture the information about the amino acid composition, sequence order as well as various physicochemical properties of proteins. because of the high dimensionality of the feature space, the principal component analysis is hence used to reduce the dimension from  <dig> to  <dig>  the resulting 32-dimensional feature vectors are finally fed into a simple yet powerful intimate sorting algorithm for the prediction of gpcrs at five levels.

by evaluating on the datasets constructed from the latest version of the gpcrdb database, the overall accuracies of our method from the first level to the fifth level are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. we further test and compare our method with several other methods based on four benchmark datasets widely used in the literature. at the second level, for a dataset containing  <dig> gpcrs, the overall accuracy of our method reaches  <dig> %. at the fourth level, for two different datasets that contain  <dig> and  <dig> gpcrs, the overall accuracies of our method reach up to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. they are all higher than those of the other methods under comparison. at the first two levels, we further test our method on a low-homology dataset . the overall accuracies thus achieved at the first level and second level are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, respectively, which are  <dig> % and  <dig> % higher than those of the method gpcr-ca.

we conclude that the high prediction accuracy of the proposed method is attributed to the comprehensive set of features that we constructed from five groups of descriptors. it is anticipated that our method could contribute more to the characterization of novel proteins and gain new insights into their functions, thereby facilitating drug discovery. a web server that predicts gpcrs at five levels with our proposed method is freely available at http://www <dig> spms.ntu.edu.sg/~chenxin/pca_gpcr.
