BACKGROUND
phenotypic evolution can result from mutations that affect either the structure or expression of protein-coding genes. the evolution of vertebrate color vision has primarily been attributed to structural mutations within the opsin genes  <cit> , a group of g-protein-coupled receptors expressed within the light-sensitive photoreceptor cells of the retina  <cit> . these structural mutations include protein-coding substitutions that alter the polarity of amino acids within the functional retinal-binding region of the opsin protein, causing the opsins and the photoreceptors they are expressed within to absorb light at longer or shorter wavelengths, thereby altering color vision . but recent research has shown that photoreceptor sensitivity can also evolve through regulatory mutations that affect opsin expression  <cit> , although the genetic basis of these regulatory changes is largely unknown. since a complex network of both cis- and trans-regulatory factors controls vertebrate opsin expression  <cit> , quantitative genetic studies of opsin gene regulation have the potential to clarify the role that different structural, cis-, and trans-regulatory mutations play in the evolution of color vision.

african cichlid fishes have undergone a dramatic adaptive radiation that involves many traits, including color vision  <cit> . in some cases, closely related cichlids differ in the maximum sensitivity of their photoreceptors by as much as  <dig> nm  <cit> . the primary genetic mechanism responsible for this diversity is the differential regulation of seven opsin genes, although structural mutations also play a role  <cit> . these seven opsins are maximally sensitive to different wavelengths of light and include sws <dig> , sws2b , sws2a , rh2b , rh2a-α and -β , and lws   <cit> ). the expression of these genes varies qualitatively among cichlids, resulting in groups of species with distinct “visual palettes”, or sets of photoreceptors broadly sensitive to short-, middle-, or long-wavelength light  <cit> . within these groups, cichlids also exhibit quantitative variation in the expression of pairs of opsins, including the sws2b/sws2a opsin pair and the rh2a/lws pair, where a reduction in the expression of one gene is compensated by an increase in the expression of the other. such qualitative and quantitative changes in opsin expression may serve to fine-tune cichlid vision in response to specific prey items, changes in the ambient light environment, or conspecific signals  <cit> .

the genetic factors responsible for interspecific variation in cichlid opsin expression and photoreceptor sensitivity are currently unknown. in two previous studies  <cit> , we used  a scan of non-coding dna located near the opsins and  a genetic cross of two lake malawi cichlids that express different visual palettes to determine that both cis- and trans-regulatory factors contribute to the evolution of cichlid color vision, although we could not resolve the location or relative importance of these loci. here, we expand on our previous studies by sampling a larger number of f <dig> progeny from the hybrid cross used in carleton et al.  <cit> . we perform a genome scan of >  <dig> sequenced restriction-site associated dna  tags to map the eqtl responsible for inter-generic differences in cichlid opsin expression. our results identify numerous overlapping eqtl which suggest that divergence in opsin trans-regulatory loci may be as important to the evolution of color vision as structural mutations within the opsins themselves.

RESULTS
genetic cross and opsin gene expression
we sampled  <dig> f <dig> progeny from an experimental cross of two lake malawi cichlids that differ in opsin gene expression. aulonocara baenschi express the middle wavelength-sensitive opsin palette  while tramitichromis intermedius express the long wavelength palette   <cit>  . using quantitative pcr, we measured the expression of all seven opsins  and found that they varied continuously among the f <dig>  except for sws <dig>  which was not expressed by either a. baenschi or t. intermedius   <cit> . as expected from our previous evolutionary and developmental studies  <cit> , we found that the expression of the sws2b/sws2a and rh2a/lws opsin pairs are each negatively correlated in a compensatory manner . although some degree of autocorrelation between opsins is expected since we measure the expression of each gene relative to the total expression of all six opsins, compensatory trade-offs between these opsin pairs are also expected since they must be alternatively expressed within identical photoreceptor classes  in order to form the distinct visual palettes found among different cichlid species. the evolutionary and developmental correlation of these pairs of opsins suggests that their expression is likely controlled by physically linked or pleiotropic loci.


genotyping and validation of snps via rad-seq
restriction-site associated dna sequencing  is a relatively new and cost-effective method of simultaneously identifying and genotyping hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms  in non-model species  <cit> . for our cichlid cross, we generated reduced-representation rad-seq libraries for all  <dig> individuals and sequenced these for  <dig> cycles on the illumina hiseq <dig> platform. sequencing yielded an average of  <dig>  million  reads per individual among ~  <dig>  unique sbfi restriction sites . we used the program stacks v <dig>   <cit>  to match orthologous rad-tags between the p <dig>  identify alternatively-fixed snps, and infer genotypes at these sites among the f <dig>  we filtered these snps for genotyping completeness, adherence to hardy-weinburg equilibrium, coverage, and unambiguous placement within a draft assembly of the metriaclima zebra cichlid genome . we ultimately retained a conservative set of  <dig> snps for linkage mapping and qtl analysis. the average coverage of each genotyped snp was 45x  in the f <dig> and 130x in the p <dig>  while the average genotype completeness was 66%. in addition to the rad-seq loci, we also genotyped microsatellite and snp markers for ten trans-regulatory factors that have been shown to influence vertebrate opsin expression  <cit> , including members of the thyroid hormone and retinoic acid family of transcription factors, retinoic acid related orphan receptors, photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptors, and steroid co-activators. we also included one microsatellite marker for each tandem array of the opsin genes located on cichlid linkage group   <dig> .

because rad-seq is a relatively new method, there are currently no published estimates of this method’s accuracy. to estimate the potential error-rate of our study, we validated the genotypes inferred from eleven rad-seq markers via pcr and direct cycle sequencing. we found errors in the genotypes inferred from all eleven loci, regardless of whether or not the marker passed our conservative filtering criteria . we estimate that the average genotyping error rate of these eleven markers is  <dig> ± <dig> % . in particular, the genotypes inferred from rad-seq underestimated the true number of heterozygotes found by cycle sequencing, suggesting that reads containing alternate alleles were either  disproportionally amplified and sequenced, or  misassembled into separate rad-seq loci. the accuracy of rad-seq can be influenced by numerous technical and user-related factors, and an analysis of the precise source of this genotyping error is out of the scope of our present study. however, we do present an expanded discussion of this problem in additional file  <dig>  although this is the first published estimate of the accuracy of rad-seq, a similar analysis of a second cross of cichlids from lake malawi presented data which suggests that  <dig> % of genotypes for the p <dig> were incorrectly inferred to be homozygous  <cit> . although disconcerting, we present evidence that these errors do not significantly hinder our ability to detect eqtl for opsin expression .

both cis- and trans- regulatory eqtl contribute to divergence in cichlid opsin expression
we assembled the rad-seq and candidate gene loci into a high-density linkage map of the cichlid genome, and then we refined the placement of markers in this map by aligning the  <dig> bp consensus sequence of each rad-seq tag to draft assemblies of the oreochromis niloticus and metriaclima zebra cichlid genomes . the resulting genetic map comprised  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig> cm . this map is largely co-linear with a genetic map of the model cichlid o. niloticus, which has a haploid genome of  <dig> chromosomes and a combined length of  <dig>  gb and  <dig> cm  <cit> . all linkage groups in our map share the same numbering scheme as those for o. niloticus, with the sole exception of the twenty-third linkage group, lg un.

previously, we estimated that 6– <dig> eqtl underlie inter-generic differences in opsin gene expression between a. baenschi and t. intermedius <cit> . specifically, we estimated that 1– <dig> eqtl each underlie the divergent expression of the sws2a, sws2b, rh2b, and rh2a opsins, and that 4– <dig> eqtl underlie the divergent expression of the lws opsin. in this study, we used a model-selection approach to multiple qtl mapping implemented in the program r/qtl in order to identify as many eqtl as possible, including their interactions, while minimizing the inclusion of false-positives  <cit> . this approach identified a total of  <dig> eqtl:  <dig> each for sws2b, sws2a, and rh2b expression,  <dig> for rh2a expression, and  <dig> for lws expression, closely matching our previous estimate . these models explained a total of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the variation in the expression of the sws2b, sws2a, rh2b, rh2a, and lws opsins, respectively. none of the models included epistatic  effects, although several eqtl showed considerable deviations from additivity . on average, each eqtl explained  <dig> %  of the variance in the expression of the affected opsin and had a logarithm of the odds  score equal to  <dig> ± <dig> . the majority of the eqtl we found overlap each other on just two cichlid linkage groups, lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  although we also found eqtl on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .


b we conservatively classify all eqtl that occur on the same linkage group as the opsins as cis, while the eqtl found on unlinked chromosomes are necessarily trans.

the five opsin genes that vary in expression between a. baenschi and t. intermedius are all found in two tandem arrays on lg  <dig> ; thus, the three eqtl on this lg represent potential cis-regulatory eqtl given their proximity to the opsins . two eqtl for sws2b and sws2a expression on lg  <dig> each include a microsatellite marker located <  <dig> cm from the sws2bsws2alws opsin gene array. a third eqtl for rh2b expression is also located on lg  <dig>  but it does not overlap with the other two eqtl and it does not include the microsatellite marker for the rh2b-rh2aα-rh2aβ array . although we consider these three eqtl putative cis-regulatory loci, we note that trans-regulatory factors such as micrornas also occur in close physical proximity to the cichlid opsin genes  <cit> . additionally, the peak of the rh2b eqtl is located far  from the rh2b opsin. therefore, it is possible that one or more of the eqtl on lg  <dig> actually represent divergent trans-regulatory factors. the presence of these three eqtl partially confirms the preliminary mapping results of carleton et al.  <cit>  who also found evidence of eqtl for these three opsins on lg  <dig>  although we did not find comparable evidence for an sws2b/sws2a eqtl on lg  <dig> as in  <cit> .

the remaining eqtl on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> represent divergent trans-regulatory loci since no opsin genes are located on these four linkage groups . two of the eqtl for lws opsin expression are found alone on lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  and a third was found on lg  <dig>  where it overlaps perfectly with the sole eqtl for rh2a expression . the fourth and final eqtl for lws expression was found on the distal arm of lg  <dig>  where it overlaps three other eqtl for sws2b, sws2a, and rh2b expression .

to confirm the results of our eqtl mapping analysis, we re-sequenced the rad-seq loci underlying six eqtl and used single-marker regression to confirm these associations . our cycle sequencing results confirm the presence of eqtl for rh2b, rh2a/lws, and sws2b/sws2a/rh2a expression on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively , while three additional eqtl for lws and sws2b/sws2a expression on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> are also confirmed by candidate microsatellite loci . since we found numerous eqtl that match our expectations from previous castle-wright estimates  <cit>  and support these associations with re-sequencing, it seems unlikely that the genotyping errors inferred from rad-seq impaired out ability to detect qtl in this study.

a genetic regulatory network for cichlid opsin expression
although experimental work in humans, mammals, and fish has identified many cis- and trans-regulatory elements that control opsin gene expression and photoreceptor identity , our study has identified those elements of the regulatory network that allow for rapid evolutionary changes in cichlid opsin gene expression and color vision, many of which have occurred in only the last two million years. in particular, the overlapping eqtl on lgs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> suggests that many opsins may be co-regulated by tightly linked or pleiotropic loci. consistent with the hypothesis of compensatory regulation, we find that the overlapping eqtl for sws2b/sws2a and rh2a/lws expression are predominantly additive, with effects that are similar in magnitude but opposite in direction . the distinct “visual palettes” of african cichlids could therefore be explained by the presence of transcription factors or regulatory “hot spots” that control the compensatory expression of two or more opsins simultaneously. unfortunately, however, none of the  <dig> candidate genes used in our analysis were found within these eqtl regions . but by mapping the rad-seq markers from these regions to the m. zebra genome assembly, we found that the 95% bayesian confidence intervals for most eqtl correspond to just one or two genomic scaffolds . a quick survey of genes located within these regions reveals additional candidates for photoreceptor function and opsin gene expression, including gnao <dig>  neurod <dig>  and pax <dig> , ncoa <dig> and rar-γ <dig> , prph <dig> and otx- <dig> , nr2e <dig> , and rxr-α   <cit> . future work will fine-map the causative mutations within these eqtl and use additional crosses to identify loci responsible for regulatory variation in the remaining sws <dig> opsin gene. these future mapping studies should reveal more about the architecture and evolution of the genetic regulatory network governing vertebrate opsin gene expression.

comparison of opsin structural and regulatory mutations
recent reviews of genetic adaptation have contrasted the role that different structural and regulatory mutations play in the evolution of morphological and physiological diversity  <cit> . to be sure, structural mutations within the opsins certainly contribute to interspecific differences in vertebrate photoreceptor sensitivity and color vision  <cit> . in cichlids, a. baenschi and t. intermedius exhibit amino acid substitutions within several opsins , including one, sws2b a269t, that has been shown to shift the sensitivity of this opsin by  <dig> nm in some fish species  <cit> . but regulatory mutations can also tune color vision by altering the ratio of photoreceptors that contain paralogous opsins of different sensitivities  <cit> . compared to the presumably functional a269t mutation within the sws2b opsin, we find that the overlapping regulatory eqtl for sws2b/sws2a expression on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> shift the expression of these opsins by an average of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in homozygotes, respectively . although small, these regulatory changes are expected to shift the average absorbance of sws2-containing photoreceptors by  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm – a shift that is equal to that caused by the sws2b a269t structural mutation. this shift will be even greater if considered in combination with the other overlapping eqtl for rh2b and lws expression on lg  <dig> . thus, the evolution of color vision could result from regulatory as well as structural mutations, especially among species that possess several paralogous opsin genes.

comparison of opsin cis- and trans-regulatory mutations
in addition to comparisons of structural and regulatory mutation, reviews of regulatory evolution have also contrasted the likely impact of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations on expression phenotypes  <cit> . these studies have emphasized a key role for cis-regulatory evolution and the past decade of research has uncovered a growing number of cis-regulatory mutations responsible for morphological adaptations among divergent but closely related species . one reason for this emphasis is undoubtedly discovery bias. by definition, cis-regulatory mutations occur in close proximity to the genes they regulate; therefore, they are better candidates for genetic mapping than trans-regulatory mutations, which could be located anywhere in the genome. but a second, more compelling reason for this emphasis is the unique action of cis-regulatory alleles. cis-regulatory alleles are typically additive and modular in their effect. these two features increase the chance that alternate cis-regulatory alleles can reach fixation via natural selection, and they also minimize any negative consequences of pleiotropy that could result from structural mutations within the developmental regulatory genes that typically govern morphological evolution  <cit> . furthermore, although the potential for mutation is probably greater for trans- rather than cis-regulatory sequences  <cit> , direct comparisons within and between species suggest that trans-regulatory mutations are initially more common for intraspecific comparisons, but that cis-regulatory mutations accumulate preferentially over time and dominate interspecific and intergeneric comparisons  <cit> . thus, both theory and observation suggest that cis-regulatory mutations should preferentially contribute to interspecific divergence in gene expression and phenotypic adaptation, and examples of this have become increasingly common, while examples of phenotypic adaptation due to trans-regulatory mutations are exceptionally rare .

however, here we study inter-generic divergence in cichlid opsin expression and find that trans-regulatory loci account for the majority  of the eqtl identified. additionally, these trans-regulatory eqtl contribute to the divergent expression of all five variable opsins , whereas the potential cis-regulatory eqtl on lg  <dig> only contribute to the divergent expression of three opsins, and then only in combination with other trans-regulatory eqtl . thus, our results suggest that trans-regulatory variation in gene expression may contribute to phenotypic evolution more commonly than expected, and that the significance of trans-regulatory divergence need not be limited to intraspecific variation. in the future, allele-specific expression can be used to better proportion interspecific variation in cichlid opsin expression among different cis- and trans-regulatory factors; however, our current eqtl analysis indicates that divergence in trans-regulatory loci disproportionately contribute to the evolution of opsin gene expression and photoreceptor sensitivity among african cichlid fishes.

five factors likely underlie our finding that trans-regulatory eqtl disproportionately contribute to the evolution of cichlid color vision; two factors are related to our study design and three to real biological phenomena. first, by measuring opsin gene expression directly, we can easily proportion vision qtl into potential cis- and trans-regulatory loci based on their genomic position relative to the opsin genes. studies that examine the sequence and expression of genes related to specific phenotypes, like the opsins and color vision, may be better suited to tease apart the role of different structural and regulatory mutations than studies that simply start with morphological or physiological traits and map those easiest to identify . second, the cichlids of lake malawi are the product of an adaptive radiation that has produced hundreds of new species in less than  <dig> million years  <cit> . many cichlid species and genera remain interfertile and share numerous polymorphisms, possibly making interspecific comparisons of regulatory divergence among cichlids more analogous to intraspecific comparisons among other model species  <cit> . third, the opsin genes have a limited physiological function. they encode structural proteins that are not regulatory, and their expression is generally restricted to the neural retina and skin  <cit> , although opsins are also expressed within the brain and ovaries of some fish species  <cit> . this limited function means that either structural, cis-, or trans-regulatory mutations could be used to tune photoreceptor sensitivity while still avoiding the negative consequences of pleiotropy that are supposed to favor cis-regulatory alleles  <cit> . fourth, the opsin genes occur at the end of a large regulatory network that includes multiple interacting transcription factors, including the retinoic acid and thyroid hormone nuclear receptors  <cit> . since the number of transcription factors that control a gene’s expression is positively correlated with the degree of trans-regulatory divergence  <cit> , the large number of trans-regulatory factors that control vertebrate opsin expression suggests that these genes could be predisposed to evolve new expression patterns in trans. finally, the distinct “visual palettes” of african cichlids are the result of heterochronic changes that simultaneously alter the expression of multiple opsins genes. phenotypes intermediate to these three palettes are generally not found among wild-caught species  <cit> . theoretically, the coordinated compensatory changes required to produce these palettes could be easily achieved by a mutation that alters the structure or expression of a single trans-regulatory factor that controls multiple downstream opsins. in contrast, separate mutations upstream of each opsin would be required to make the same changes via cis-regulatory divergence, especially for opsins that are not joined in a tandem array. thus, trans-regulatory mutations may be better suited to the evolution of complex phenotypes that are governed by the coordinated expression of multiple genes, like those that govern many sensory systems.

CONCLUSIONS
although the evolution of color vision in vertebrates is primarily attributed to structural mutations within the opsin genes, we have shown that divergence in both cis- and trans-regulatory loci can also tune vertebrate photoreceptor sensitivity. in particular, we found that divergence in trans-regulatory eqtl disproportionally contribute to the inter-generic evolution of opsin gene expression and photoreceptor sensitivity among african cichlid fishes. although several unique properties of the opsins may explain this observation, our results suggest that trans-regulatory mutations could contribute to phenotypic divergence more commonly than previously expected, especially in cases where the coordinated and compensatory expression of multiple genes are necessary to drive the evolution of phenotypic traits.
