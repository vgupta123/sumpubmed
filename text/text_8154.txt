BACKGROUND
bread wheat  is a staple cereal crop and a major source of carbohydrates, mainly starch. starch is a complex glucose polymer that presents in a granular form known as a starch granule. starch granules comprise two distinct glucose polymers - amylose  and amylopectin  – consisting of about 25 %  and 75 %  of total starch, respectively. their composition affects processing, cooking, organoleptic, and nutritional quality of end-use food products. starch has wide applications in food industries where it is modified by chemical treatment as per requirement. amylose or amylopectin fractions, however, have been altered in plants per se through extensive breeding approaches as well as using advanced functional genomics tools to improve processing and nutritional quality. for example, partial waxy wheats have been developed by decreasing waxy proteins  to create low amylose wheat which is used in the production of good-quality noodles. . high amylose wheats have been developed using advanced functional genomics tools, as well as ems treatments and breeding approaches . amylose has been increased to make ‘type  <dig> resistant starch’  for improving nutritional quality. it is found that high amylose starch  is digested slower than normal starch in the stomach and small intestine, similar to dietary fiber  <cit> . it has a low glycemic index and, therefore, it can be used to make low glycemic index food products for people with obesity or diabetes. further, high amylose starch is fermented in the lower intestine to release small chain fatty acids , which provide additional health benefits to colon health and brain tissues. the detailed account of the functionality and application of low and high amylose wheat starches is given elsewhere  <cit> .

amylose is predominately a linear glucan polymer chain of a few hundred to a few thousand glucose units linked by α- <dig> -linkages, whereas amylopectin is a highly branched glucan polymer chain of many thousands of glucose units with α- <dig>  and α- <dig>  linkages  <cit> . starch is biosynthesized within the amyloplasts from glucose-1-phosphate. starch biosynthesis is initiated by adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase  from glucose-1-phosphate in seed amyloplasts and further by a series of several classes of enzymes whose isoforms are involved in the biosynthesis of amylose and amylopectin  <cit> . amylose is biosynthesized by granule-bound starch synthase  while amylopectin is biosynthesized by the coordinated actions of soluble starch synthase , starch branching enzyme , and starch debranching enzyme   <cit> . starch metabolic pathway genes responsible for the modulation of the amylose-amylopectin ratio have been identified either through extensive breeding approaches  or through advance biotechnological approaches, including t-dna or transposon insertion  <cit>  and rnai  <cit> .

chemical agents have been used to produce phenotypic variation. among them, ethyl methanesulfonate  has been widely used in crops  <cit> . it is an alkylating agent directly affecting dna by alkylating guanine  bases, causing mispairing with thiamine  instead of cytosine , resulting in a transition from g/c to a/t  <cit> . this is preferable to other biotechnological approaches as it produces a large spectrum of mutations and allows multiple alleles of a specific gene in a small population. ems-induced mutagenesis has been widely used to produce novel allelic variation in genes which are involved in starch biosynthesis. partial null-waxy and complete waxy phenotypes were produced by targeting the loci of the gene encoding gbssi in wheat  <cit> . in addition, other starch metabolic genes such as sbeiia, sbeiib and ssiia were also targeted for development of low or high amylose starch in wheat .

amylose possesses a unique biochemical property, as it forms a deep blue color when exposed to iodine in solution. its linear glucan chains form briefly and coil around iodine molecules, creating a non-polar environment, which changes the refractive index and results in a deep blue color  <cit> . it is believed that estimation of amylose content by iodine binding may be an overestimate due to it binding also with long branches of amylopectin, if present. therefore amylose content, as estimated by the traditional iodine reaction, is sometimes designated as “apparent amylose” or “amylose-equivalent”. however, using a calibration curve and standards of known amylose content of related crop species, the overestimation can be minimized  <cit> . identification of genes/qtl using natural variations in a heterogeneous population is a challenging task  <cit> . it is highly advocated to use near isogenic lines and/or functional genomic tools such as rnai  <cit>  or genome editing  <cit> . both approaches have been successfully used in wheat. a set of mutant lines in the same genetic background showing the dynamic range of variation in amylose content are required for genome-wide analysis to understand amylose or amylopectin biosynthesis. in this study, a set of ems treated mutant lines showing continuous variation in amylose and resistant starch content have been developed in a bread wheat variety. further, one high amylose mutant line and one low amylose mutant line were used to study quantitative gene expression patterns of  <dig> starch metabolic pathway genes during seed development.

RESULTS
advance generation of ems-induced population in wheat
the bread wheat variety, ‘c 306’, used in this study was released in  <dig> in india . ems  treatment of ~ <dig> seeds  of the parent bread wheat variety ‘c 306’ produced ~2400 m <dig> plants with a germination rate of ~50 %. the m <dig> plants were self-pollinated and individual spikes of primary tillers were collected to produce ~1400 m <dig> seeds. these were sown and generated 1035 m <dig> seeds. the majority of m <dig> plants were morphologically homogeneous, resembling the parental type, and thus used for further analysis. mutant lines differing in height, leaf color, and morphology were not used. different concentrations of ems  have been previously used to create mutant populations in wheat . the ems treated lines were used to identify mutations in candidate genes of interest in diploid  <cit> , tetraploid  <cit> , and hexaploid wheat  <cit> . ems concentrations used in this study were able to produce variation in amylose content .

evaluation of amylose variation in mutant lines
a traditional iodine-potassium iodide  solution showed variation in blue color on half-seeds of 1035 m <dig> mutant lines . the lines were subjectively divided into three groups on the basis of blue color intensity. the first group comprised  <dig> lines that did not develop color, indicating low amylose content. the second group comprised  <dig> lines that developed light blue color intensity, indicating intermediate amylose content. the third group comprised  <dig> lines that developed a high intensity blue color indicating high amylose content . further, we observed variation in the time taken to develop blue color. the data on the time taken to develop blue color is provided in additional file  <dig>  a subset of  <dig> mutant lines, taken from the three groups of 1035 m <dig> mutant lines, was selected on the basis of color intensity and time taken to develop color. measurements of amylose/resistant starch content were taken for this subset. further regression analysis between the time taken to develop blue color and the measured amylose content in the  <dig> mutant lines  showed a significant negative correlation value , indicating a negative relationship between time taken to develop blue color and increased ac , which is in agreement with previous results  <cit> . amylose content prediction by single-seed or half-seed has been well established for a variety of cereals such as wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and barley  <cit> . the data on intensity and time taken to develop blue color on half-seed using a five-times diluted i2-ki standard solution would be useful for screening large populations for low, intermediate, and high amylose content predictions in wheat breeding programs.fig.  <dig> blue color intensity on half-seeds of two ems treated mutant lines and the parent variety varying in amylose content. low , intermediate , and high  color intensity were observed in seeds of the low amylose mutant line , the parent variety , and the high amylose mutant line , respectively


fig.  <dig> regression analysis of amylose content  on time taken  to develop blue color in the  <dig> ems treated m <dig> mutant lines. the amylose content was measured in starch extracted from grains of the mutant lines and time taken  to develop blue color was recorded for the half-seeds of the mutant lines soaked in iodine-potassium iodide  solution




amylose measurements in the starch of  <dig> mutant lines  obtained by using two methods - traditional i2-ki and con a methods - showed variation in amylose content ranging from ~ <dig>  to 76 %  . while both methods showed similar amylose content in measured lines, there were a few exceptions. one-way anova analysis showed no significant variation  between the amylose content data from the two methods. furthermore, the data from two biological replicates showed similar amylose content to the  <dig> mutant lines. one-way anova analysis showed no significant variation in amylose content of the lines in the two biological replications . the similarity and strong correlation between traditional iodine binding and megazyme’s con a methods of amylose measurement was reported earlier  <cit> . the two methods of amylose measurement and the biological replicates indicated that amylose content in these mutant lines is consistent and stable in the m <dig> generation. the anova analysis showed significant differences  among the  <dig> mutant lines for amylose content. a multiple comparison test  of mean data for each mutant line, with respect to the parent variety ‘c 306’, showed significant differences in  <dig> mutant lines. this indicates that the majority of the mutant lines  showed significant variation in amylose content from the parent variety.table  <dig> evaluation of amylose content, resistant starch content, and thousand kernel weight  in the  <dig> ems treated m <dig> mutant lines

amylose content was measured by concanavalin a  method in seed starch. resistant starch content was measured through a modified protocol of megazyme. thousand kernel weight  was recorded on randomly selected seeds




out of  <dig> mutant lines,  <dig> showed >30 % ac, indicating high amylose mutant lines and  <dig> lines showed <15 % ac, indicating low amylose mutant lines. within the high amylose lines, three lines showed >70 % ac, ten showed 60–70 % ac, and five showed 50–60 % ac. in the low amylose lines, two lines showed <5 % ac, three showed 5–10 % ac, and  <dig> showed 10–15 % ac. individual high amylose lines with 70–85 % ac  <cit>  have been developed in wheat. other high amylose lines with 30–60 % ac have been reported in wheat including diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid species . similarly, individual low amylose lines  have been developed  <cit> . in this study, a wide range of high amylose lines with  <dig> to 76 % ac have been developed in the same genetic background in wheat using ems. therefore, these lines would be useful for genome-wide analysis of the genetic and molecular basis of amylose variation in wheat.

measurement of resistant starch in mutant lines
resistant starch measurements showed a variation from about  <dig> to 41 % in the mutant lines . twelve mutant lines showed very high resistant starch content . sixteen mutant lines showed  <dig> to 30 % resistant starch content. anova analysis showed significant differences  in resistant starch  content of the  <dig> mutant lines and no significant differences were observed between the biological replicates. a multiple comparison test  of mean data for each mutant line, with respect to the parent variety ‘c 306’, showed significant differences in  <dig> mutant lines. this indicates that significant variation in resistant starch content, with respect to the parent, was observed in about ~38 % of the  <dig> mutant lines, whereas variation in amylose content was observed in ~89 % of the  <dig> mutant lines. the amylose content of the  <dig> mutant lines was between 42–76 %. the resistant starch content in the high amylose lines reported in the published literatures was between ~ <dig> to 14 %  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> mutant lines showed >15 % resistant starch content. these lines would be useful for genome-wide analysis of the genetic and molecular basis of resistant starch variation as well as the improvement of nutritional quality in wheat.

evaluation of thousand-kernel weight in the mutant lines
thousand-kernel weight  of the  <dig> mutant lines ranged from about 32 g  to 62 g  and that of the parent variety, ‘c 306’, was about 40 g . a multiple comparison test  of mean data for each mutant line with respect to the parent variety, ‘c 306’, showed significant differences in  <dig> mutant lines. this indicates that the majority of these mutant lines have better grain weights than that of the parent variety. statistical correlation analysis  of tkw with amylose and resistant starch content of the mutant lines were − <dig>   and − <dig>  , respectively, indicating poor negative correlations. the tkw correlation analysis of the mutant lines with >30 % amylose content and >5 % rs showed − <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively, still indicating poor correlation. correlation analysis of amylose content of low amylose lines, i.e. partial waxy mutant lines,  with their tkw showed slightly strong negative correlations . observations reported by  <cit>  show a lower or similar tkw of ems-treated waxy bread wheat lines to those of the wild type. in this study, most of the high amylose mutant lines that have better grain weights than that of the parent variety would be useful in wheat improvement breeding for high amylose.

quantitative expression analysis of starch metabolic pathway genes in high and low amylose mutant lines
in order to study the expression patterns of  <dig> starch metabolic pathway genes, including the genes responsible for amylose and amylopectin biosynthesis, quantitative expression profiles were constructed during three stages of seed development for two mutant lines and the parental wheat variety ‘c 306’ . these two mutant lines contain about 7 %  and 64 %  amylose content. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> were starch biosynthesis genes . also found among the  <dig> genes were four starch degrading genes  and two transcription factors .fig.  <dig> real-time quantitative expression data  of  <dig> starch metabolic genes during seed development in the high amylose  mutant line, ‘tac 75’, in comparison to the parent variety, ‘c 306’ . the seed development stages were  <dig>   <dig>  and 35 days after anthesis . all the data are represented as mean ± sd from two biological and three technical replicates. the symbol ‘*’ indicates significant difference at p <  <dig>

expression pattern of starch metabolic genes in high amylose mutant line
the comparative quantitative gene expression analysis of  <dig> starch metabolic genes identified seven genes whose expressions were consistent throughout seed development in the high amylose mutant line  in comparison with the parental wheat variety ‘c306’ . of the seven, three genes  showed overexpression and four genes  showed reduced expression during seed development in the high amylose mutant line. the expression of the remaining  <dig> starch metabolic genes was inconsistent, i.e. either high or low expression during seed development. in this study, overexpression of gbssi in the high amylose mutant lines during the grain filling stage may lead to a higher accumulation of amylose as gbssi plays a key role in the biosynthesis of amylose by elongating the linear α- <dig>  glucan chain  <cit> . over-expression of gbssi enhanced amylose content in rice and wheat  <cit>  while silent or null mutants produced waxy or partial waxy wheats either lacking amylose or having low amounts of amylose  <cit> . overexpression of spa may have a positive regulatory effect on amylose biosynthesis, given that the null mutant  for the rice homologue osbzip <dig>  decreased amylose content in rice  <cit> . amylose content can also be increased by the reduced expression or activity of the isoforms of ss, sbe, and isoamylases. functional loss of ssiii in maize led to dull- <dig> phenotype, which moderately increased the amylose content to 35–45 %  <cit> . antisense inhibition of isa in rice alters amylopectin structure  <cit> . sbeii is a key gene for amylopectin biosynthesis. silencing of sbeii has enhanced amylose content  <cit> . therefore, this study indicates that amylose accumulation in the high amylose mutant lines may have been the result of an overexpression of key genes for amylose biosynthesis as well as a downregulation of amylopectin and starch biosynthesis genes.

expression pattern of starch metabolic genes in low amylose mutant line
the comparative quantitative gene expression analysis of  <dig> starch metabolic genes identified eight genes whose expressions were consistent throughout seed development in the low amylose mutant line ‘tac 6’ in comparison to the parental wheat variety ‘c306’ . of the eight genes, three  showed overexpression and five  showed reduced expression during seed development in the low amylose mutant line. the expression of the remaining  <dig> starch metabolic genes was not consistent, i.e. either high or low expression during seed development. amylases such as alpha and beta-amylases  along with starch phosphorylases, both plastidial  and cytosolic , play important roles in starch metabolism including hydrolysis and degradation  <cit> . they are starch modifying genes with major roles in maintaining starch structure and starch granule morphology. silencing of starch phosphorylase in rice and potato showed alterations in starch structure  <cit> , whereas over expression of amy and bmy affected the starch granules’ structure and baking quality  <cit> . among the down-expressed genes, ssi is also considered a key gene for amylopectin biosynthesis. its loss of function in rice and wheat increased amylose content and decreased amylopectin, with differences in the branching pattern  <cit> . among highly expressed genes in the low amylose mutant line, sbeii is a key gene for amylopectin biosynthesis and its over expression increased amylopectin content in potato  <cit> . using co-expression analysis, a negative transcription factor, rsr <dig> , was identified in rice  <cit> . it is an apetala2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor which significantly negatively regulates the expression of a few starch metabolic genes and thus modulates starch metabolism and starch-related phenotypes. in this study, the down expression of its wheat homologue, tarsr <dig>  in the low mutant line indicates that its effect may not have modulated starch metabolism. therefore, this study indicates that amylopectin accumulation in the low amylose mutant line may have resulted from overexpression of key genes for amylopectin and starch biosynthesis as well as downregulation of amylose biosynthesis genes.

the differential gene expression analysis in the low and high amylose mutant lines in comparison to the parent variety support the involvement of other starch metabolic pathway genes such as phosphorylases, isoamylases, etc. in amylose/amylopectin biosynthesis in addition to the key biosynthesis genes .

quantitative expression analysis of chromosome specific gbssi alleles and sbeii isoforms
quantitative expression analysis was performed to study the expression pattern of key genes of amylose  and amylopectin  biosynthesis in the high and low amylose mutant lines in comparison to the parent variety ‘c 306’ . the gbssi gene  is responsible for amylose biosynthesis in storage tissues. wheat endosperm contains three isoforms of the waxy protein encoded by the waxy  loci. these loci are wx-a <dig>  wx-b <dig>  and wx-d <dig>  which are located on chromosomes, 7a, 4a , and 7d, respectively  <cit> . in comparison to the parent variety, the expression level of the three alleles of gbssi  was high in the high amylose mutant line. expression levels were low in ‘tac 6’, except for the expression of the 4a allele during seed development . the down regulation of the 7a and 7d alleles indicates that the low mutant line may have null alleles of 7a and 7d  which may cause low amylose content . double-null partial waxy wheat with reduced amylose content was reported  <cit> . the loss of one, two, or three gbssi isoforms results in the formation of single-null partial waxy, double-null partial waxy, and waxy wheat, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> real-time quantitative expression data  of chromosome specific alleles of gbssi during seed development of two mutant lines, ‘tac 75’ and ‘tac 6’, in comparison to the parent variety, ‘c 306’ . the seed development stages were  <dig>   <dig>  and 35 days after anthesis . all the data are represented as mean ± sd from two biological and three technical replicates. the symbol ‘*’ indicates significant difference at p <  <dig> 


fig.  <dig> real-time quantitative expression data  of isoforms of sbeii during seed development of two mutant lines, ‘tac 75’ and ‘tac 6’, in comparison to the parent variety, ‘c 306’ . the seed development stages were  <dig>   <dig>  and 35 days after anthesis . all the data are represented as mean ± sd from two biological and three technical replicates. the symbol ‘*’ indicates significant difference at p <  <dig> 




in comparison to the parent variety, the expression level of both sbeii isoforms  was low in the high amylose mutant line and, as expected, high in the low amylose mutant lines . starch branching enzymes  catalyze the hydrolysis of α- <dig>  glycosidic linkages and re-attach the chain to α- <dig>  positions and thus are involved in amylopectin biosynthesis. two isoforms of sbeii have been reported in wheat and are classified as sbeiia and sbeiib  <cit> . besides the higher expression of all three alleles of gbssi in the high amylose mutant line, lower expression of both isoforms of sbeiia and sbeiib were also indirectly responsible for the elevation of amylose content. the suppression or null allele of both sbeiia and sbeiib have resulted in elevated amylose content in wheat  <cit> .

the expression patterns of gbssi and sbeii indicate that loss of function of the two waxy alleles  reduces the amylose content, while higher expression of both sbeii isoforms  resulted in increased amylopectin content in the low amylose mutant line. in contrast, the expression patterns of gbssi and sbeii indicate that overexpression of the three waxy alleles  elevates amylose content, while down expression of both sbeii isoforms  decreases amylopectin in the high amylose mutant line.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study a set of  <dig> ems-induced mutant lines , showing variation in amylose and resistant starch content in seed, serve as useful germplasm or pre-breeding materials for genome-wide study and improvement of starch-based processing and nutritional quality in wheat. this population is also useful for the study of the genetic and molecular basis of amylose/resistant starch variation in wheat. further, gene expression analysis of  <dig> starch metabolic genes in the two diverse mutant lines  indicates that in addition to key genes, several other genes  may also be involved in contributing to amylose/amylopectin biosynthesis.
