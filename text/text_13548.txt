BACKGROUND
the loggerhead shrike, eastern subspecies   is a predatory songbird native to eastern north america. they are highly territorial birds that breed in short grasslands where it is easier to find prey. breeding pairs build their nests cooperatively and egg-laying starts in mid-late april in ontario. five to seven eggs are laid in a clutch and the incubation period is 16 days. young losh fledge  in 17– <dig> days and, as fledglings, continue to be fed by the parents for approximately 28 days more.

in  <dig>  losh was listed as endangered by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada   <cit> ; it was also listed under the species at risk act  as endangered in  <dig> and is protected under the migratory birds convention act  <dig>   <cit> . in may  <dig>  the subspecies migrans was de-activated and the eastern canada population was considered to represent an unnamed eastern subspecies , which remains listed as endangered  <cit> . most of the canadian population is believed to be limited to scattered small areas in ontario, though it also breeds rarely in québec  <cit> . it is estimated that there are fewer than  <dig> breeding pairs in north america and fewer than  <dig> individual birds  <cit> . the eastern subspecies migrates to south-central united states, although the southern distribution of the wintering population remains uncertain. young and adults alike begin their southward migration in early-mid august  <cit> .

the cause of the population decline in canada is not fully understood, but loss and fragmentation of breeding and wintering habitat is believed to be a major contributing factor  <cit> . other hypotheses include environmental contaminants , infectious disease, motor vehicle collisions, extreme weather events, predation and competition with other bird species that are more tolerant to changing environments .

a captive breeding program was started in  <dig>  with the following goals: 1) to recover the losh population in ontario and québec; and, 2) to preserve the genetic diversity of the wild population. the program was first established at the toronto zoo  and mcgill university  with the recruitment of wild nestlings to form a captive breeding population. in  <dig>  experimental in-situ captive breeding and release was initiated .

the program is currently managed by wildlife preservation canada  on behalf of environment canada, canadian wildlife service  – ontario. between  <dig> and  <dig>  over  <dig> captive-bred young were released into the wild. once released, captive-reared shrikes have high survival  <cit>  and, when paired with a wild shrike, their breeding success is comparable to pairs containing two wild birds  <cit> . the captive breeding program plays a crucial role in preventing this shrike subspecies from being extirpated from its canadian range  <cit> . the release of nearly  <dig> fledglings annually into the wild has stabilized the wild population of losh in ontario at between 22– <dig> breeding pairs  <cit> .

despite its successes, the program experienced significant unexplained mortality among fledglings beginning in  <dig>  postmortem examination of mortalities at the toronto zoo and the canadian cooperative wildlife health centre ) revealed generally non-specific findings, the most common being terminal gastric hemorrhage, which usually is associated with stress. the problem persisted in subsequent breeding seasons and in late  <dig>  the collaborators on this paper came together to investigate this threat to the recovery plan.

the purpose of this study was to 1) describe fledgling mortality trends in the captive losh population between 2006– <dig>  and 2) identify factors associated with fledgling survival. the overall goal was to identify steps to potentially mitigate fledgling mortality in the captive losh population.

all required research permits were obtained for this work , and research ethics were approved by environment canada, canadian wildlife service /cws animal care committee approval, project #rs01).

RESULTS
in total, between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> losh were fledged at carden  and at dyer’s bay  . among these fledglings,  <dig>  were released,  <dig>  were retained in the breeding population, and  <dig>  died. over the study period, on average,  <dig> fledglings were released annually from these two sites, ranging from a high of  <dig> in  <dig> to a low of  <dig> in  <dig>  the proportion of fledglings that survived declined from 99 %  in  <dig> to 44 %  in  <dig> . among those fledglings that died, a cause of death was rarely determined. in total,  <dig> fledglings were submitted for necropsy during the study period from carden and dyer’s bay,  <dig>  died of unknown causes,  <dig>  died of infectious causes , and  <dig>  died from various traumatic injuries.table  <dig> breeding and fledgling data – carden and dyer’s bay 2006-2011

the following variables were statistically significant based on univariable analysis: study year, clutch number, number of nestlings in the nest, number of fledglings in the brood, the natural log of the breeding female age and its quadratic term . the age of the breeding male was also considered for inclusion in the multivariable model based on a liberal p-value. although statistically significant, the number of nestlings  was not considered for inclusion in the final model since it was highly correlated with the number of fledglings , and the number of fledglings was more reliably assessed in the field by the staff of the breeding program.table  <dig> name and description of variables included in uni-variable and multi-variable multi-level logistic regression models

based on the variance components, we estimated that  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of the variance in survival was explained at the fledgling, clutch, and breeding pair levels, respectively, after accounting for the fixed effects in the model. based on an intercept only model ,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of the variance in survival was explained at the fledgling, clutch, and breeding pair levels, respectively.

the best linear unbiased predictors  at the pair-level met all the model assumptions. the blups examined at the clutch-level showed homogeneity of variance, but they appeared to be left skewed. however, the inclusion of this random effect improved the fit of the model based on lower akaike's information criteria   and schwarz's bayesian information criteria   values when the full model was compared to a model that did include the random intercept for clutch. three observations had large pearson residuals, but there was no evidence of recording errors, and the observations were retained in the model.

discussion
our analyses suggest that clutch number, number of fledglings in the brood, and breeding female age were significant predictors of fledgling survival. management of the captive breeding population can influence many of these factors.

based on our multivariable model, it appears that fledgling survival is lower among second clutch birds. we hypothesize that this may be due to higher breeding stress and reduced fitness of the parents after having already fledged one brood. lower fledgling survival arising from second clutches also may be associated with changing environmental conditions later in summer. second clutches are uncommon among wild shrike pairs  <cit> .

additional analyses are needed to determine whether double clutching should be continued. it certainly increases the number of birds released into the wild, and as that is the goal of the captive breeding program then it may be appropriate to continue. however, as fewer fledglings from second clutches survive, the overall proportion of young birds that survive decreases. consequently, the parents invest more energy per bird released in production of the second clutch birds than those from first clutches. those energetic costs may impact reproductive success in subsequent years. research with eastern kingbirds  demonstrated that females that fledged more young in the previous breeding year experienced lower fledgling survival than those that had fledged fewer birds the year before  <cit> . to investigate whether or not the practice of double clutching negatively affected the success of the female in the subsequent breeding year, we included breeding outcome for breeding female in the previous year as a variable in the univariable model; there was no association with survival. the lack of such an association may reflect the true state of nature or a lack of power in the study, due to the small size of the captive population. because the focus of this study was to investigate mortality in a small defined population of captive birds, no sample size calculations were performed as might be done prior to a pre-planned observational study or randomized trial.

the statistical model also revealed a significant association between fledgling survival and the age of the female at breeding . survival among fledglings very quickly increases as the female ages up to 4 years, and then slowly decreases over time. this association may be attributed to improved breeding experience in the early years, followed by declining physiological reproductive capacity as the female ages. alternatively, this association may be caused by a survival bias, in that successful females are more likely to be re-bred year after year. there was no equivalent association between male breeding age and fledgling survival . neither was there as association between the female or male birth year and fledgling survival, suggesting that there was no cohort effect .

fledgling survival was higher in broods with more fledglings. this measure may be an indicator of the overall health of the brood. for example, a greater number of fledglings could be associated with less infectious and non-infectious disease among the fledglings and/or that the parents are less stressed and better at caring for their young right through the nestling and fledgling stages. to date, infectious disease has not been identified as a significant contributing factor to juvenile mortality in the captive ontario population of losh.

other possible explanations for poor captive fledgling survival may include differences in husbandry and management between breeding sites and between years. managers of the breeding facilities suggested that the size of cage  affected survival, with higher survival in clutches raised in large  cages. however, we detected no significant difference in fledgling survival between the cage types. similarly, there was no difference in fledgling survival between the two major breeding sites  during the study period, which likely reflects the similarity in management, as both sites adhered to the wpc protocol and wpc trained all the staff.

in the model presented here, we have included only data about fledgling survival. data are available about nestling survival, but more uncertainty surrounds these estimates. since nestlings can be challenging to count in the nest and can quickly disappear from the environment if they die, we limited our investigation to fledgling survival. however, some juvenile birds do die before fledging, and death may be associated with the same spectrum of risk factors.

in  <dig>  due primarily to funding constraints, the captive breeding program was restricted to one site and the density of breeding birds was substantially reduced;  <dig> fledglings were produced:  <dig>  were released,  <dig>  were retained, and  <dig>  died. the size of the release group was kept relatively large , as previous work revealed that returning birds were more likely to have been released in large groups of juveniles  <cit> . in  <dig>   <dig> fledglings from the  <dig> hatch year returned to ontario . the period 2012– <dig> has been marked by higher survival rates, and an increasing number of birds released; in  <dig> nearly  <dig> young were released, as was the case in  <dig>  before issues with increasing fledgling mortality began. the reduction in breeding pair density may have reduced stress on the birds. in addition, supplements  have been added to the diets fed in captivity. ultimately, the goal of the program is to introduce more potential breeding birds to the wild. consequently, examining the costs and benefits of altering breeding density and breeding intensity  needs to be considered for the long-term success of this program.

CONCLUSIONS
losh remain endangered in canada and the captive breeding program is an important part of maintaining this population. based on our analyses, clutch number, number of fledglings in a brood, and breeding female age were significant predictors of fledgling survival. our research found that fledgling survival was reduced for birds from second clutches, but encouraging pairs to have a second clutch does result in a greater number of birds being released; it remains unclear if compromising survival rates to ultimately release more birds into the wild is a worthwhile compromise for increasing populations of losh in the wild. long–term management decisions for the captive breeding program need to ultimately be focused on increasing the number of breeding pairs in the wild and sustaining a genetically diverse population in captivity until losh numbers are adequate to sustain a wild population.
