BACKGROUND
the mammalian central nervous system has limited capability for regeneration. spinal cord injury therefore leads to neurological dysfunctions affecting the motor, sensory as well as the autonomic systems  <cit> . in the immediate phase following spinal cord injury the excitability of the motor networks caudal to the injury becomes depressed. this initial state of motor depression is often followed by a maladaptive increase in network excitability resulting in spasticity and/or pain  <cit> . the injury-induced spasticity is characterized by a disturbing hyper-reflexia causing prolonged muscle activity upon short activation of sensory afferents  <cit> . increased excitability of spinal motor neurons, the cells that transduce the reflex response to the muscles, has been implicated in this pathophysiological state.

under normal physiological conditions the motor output  can be modulated by activation of channels in the motor neurons that conduct persistent inward currents, resulting in plateau potentials and sustained firing, leading to enhanced and prolonged muscle contraction  <cit> . the expression of plateau potentials depends on metabotropic receptor activation including activation of noradrenergic and/or serotonergic receptors. the neuromodulators that activate these receptors primarily originate from neurons located in the brainstem, which project descending fibers to the spinal cord. the ability to generate plateau potentials therefore disappears in motor neurons located caudal to a spinal cord injury  <cit> . they spontaneously reappear two to three weeks after injury due to chronic changes in motor neuron properties that parallel development of injury-induced spasticity  <cit> . to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the reappearance of plateau potentials after spinal cord injury we recently undertook a global gene expression study of motor neurons in the late phase of injury-induced spasticity  <cit>  using the rat-tail-model with a complete spinal cord transection at the s <dig> segment, developed by bennett and coworkers  <cit> . this work identified differential expression of genes relating to ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors and intracellular pathways  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury, supporting the observed increase in motor neuron excitability and the reappearance of plateau potentials  <cit> . in the present work we investigate the dynamic transcriptional response of motor neurons following spinal cord injury  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days post injury, enabling us to dissect out some of the regulatory mechanisms of transcription underlying the observed hyper-excitability. in the brain, such dynamic transcriptome analyses have been used to analyze the gene expression pattern of well-defined cell populations during development  <cit> . comprehensive studies on the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation have mostly been conducted on simpler model systems with homogenous cell populations such as cell cultures  <cit> . in the present study the transcriptional response of motor neurons over time constitute a direct measure of cell-specific processes in a complex anatomical structure, allowing us in a similar fashion to examine the expression patterns and the underlying regulatory mechanisms of this response.

cluster analysis of the gene expression time series identifies  <dig> time profiles reflecting combinations of early and late transcriptional regulations. ontology analysis shows that these clusters contain groups of genes that define over-represented ontologies, indicating that each cluster profile reflects the timing of distinct biological processes as the motor neurons respond to the injury. genes previously implicated in the development of the plateau potentials in injury-induced spasticity  <cit>  are also identified as differentially expressed over time. the general injury response is paralleled by a response in the regulatory networks of transcription factors. transcription factor motif analysis of the gene promoter sequences belonging to each time profile indicates a complex regulatory control of the different time profiles. such transcription factors could prove to be potential targets for treatment of injury-induced spasticity as well as other aspects of the injury response, where experimental manipulation of their expression could be used to alter the transcriptional response of motor neurons preventing them from entering a state of hyper-excitability.

RESULTS
transcriptional response of motor neurons to injury
spinal cord injury was inflicted by a complete spinal cord transection at the second sacral segment , in effect disconnecting the spinal networks caudal to the lesion from the remaining part of the central nervous system. the injury causes complete paralysis of the tail, with no effect on bladder, bowel or hind limb functions  <cit> . the motor paralysis of the tail is followed by a slowly developing spasticity  <cit>  in the weeks and months after injury. clinical as well as electrophysiological evaluation of tail spasticity was performed at each time point, showing a progressive development of spasticity  saturating between  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury .

to examine and compare the transcriptional response of the motor neurons in early and late post-injury phases genechip® rat genome 230_ <dig>  arrays  were hybridized with rna samples originating from motor neurons of uninjured control animals  as well as animals  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  days post injury. a conglomerate classifier based on three well-established adjusted anova test-statistics for microarray analysis  was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes used for subsequent clustering, identifying  <dig>  genes with a set false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig>   <cit> .

consensus clustering unravels distinct gene expression time profiles
in order to identify common expression profiles across time among the differentially expressed genes, transcripts were grouped into clusters of similar expression patterns using a robust consensus cluster algorithm developed by grotkjaer et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the consensus cluster algorithm is based on an averaging procedure conducted on multiple runs of k-means clustering . this procedure amplifies common patterns in the expression profiles while suppressing non-reproducible features. to reduce miss-classification due to noise in the expression data  we use the consensus clustering on the most likely differentially expressed genes. with a  <dig>  fdr level of significance  <dig>  probe sets were included in the consensus cluster analysis. the analysis revealed the existence of  <dig> distinct time profiles  each containing 178- <dig> genes. increasing the amount of consensus clusters beyond  <dig> did not reveal new patterns of expressions but rather breaks down the existing time profiles into sub-categories with very similar features. heatmaps of each of the  <dig> consensus clusters, figure 1a, show how their constituent genes change expression over time across all the microarrays in the study, where the expression levels for each transcript have been centered and normalized according to eq  <dig>  red color signifying expression above the average for a given transcript and green color signifies below average . for each cluster the average level of  expression across all its constituent genes was calculated for each time point producing cluster-specific time profiles of expression, shown in figure 1b- in the following termed cluster profiles. the similarity between cluster profiles is illustrated by the dendrogram of figure 1c as well as in the contour map of the optimal leaf ordered co-occurrence matrix shown in figure 1d. the co-occurrence contour map illustrates the degrees of gene overlap between the clusters in all the k-means cluster runs, where well defined squares represents very robust clusters while points falling outside these areas represents genes that occasionally fall into other clusters. the co-occurrence contour map is fairly well defined along the diagonal where overlapping genes for the most part are limited to neighboring clusters.

the expression time profiles fall into two main branches in the dendrogram, with profiles 1- <dig> in one branch and profiles 5- <dig> in the other. the first group  shares a pattern of late  down-regulation, whereas their early response varies . in the other group , all but profile  <dig> are characterized by an up-regulation either early , late  or both . profiles  <dig> and  <dig> have an early down-regulation followed by a subsequent up-regulation. cluster profile  <dig> is characterized by a very substantial early down-regulation followed by a slight progressive increase in expression that remains below control levels. this makes it somewhat similar to cluster profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  though as it remains below control levels even in the late phase its biological classification rather belongs to the group of down-regulated cluster profiles 1- <dig>  the co-occurrence plot, figure 1d, also illustrates this fact, where genes of profile  <dig> occasionally overlap with cluster profiles  <dig> and  <dig> as well as with cluster profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  the full list of differentially expressed genes grouped according to their cluster identification is provided in additional file  <dig> 

the consensus clustering of the differentially expressed genes thus unravels gene clusters with distinct expression time profiles. we used these clusters for ontology analysis as well as to ascribe expression profiles to genes related to motor neuron excitability changes. analysis of transcription factor regulation was performed on each cluster to identify potential mechanisms of regulation for the identified genes and ontologies.

ontology analysis of gene expression time profiles
genes may be annotated according to well-defined ontologies such as biological processes, cellular location, biochemical pathways, protein families etc. highlighting different aspect of their function. over-representation of genes within a cluster profile that share an ontology term strongly suggests that the cluster represents a set of genes that engage in or represent the identified ontology  <cit> . the ontology database maintained by the gene ontology  consortium annotating genes according to biological processes , molecular functions  and cellular compartments  as well as interpro and kegg pathways were all used in this analysis. each ontology highlights a different aspect of gene functions, making it desirable to group together over-represented ontologies containing a predefined degree of gene overlap in order to fully appreciate the functional role of each of the  <dig> time profiles. furthermore, since gene ontologies are structured as acyclic directed graphs where a gene is annotated from its most descriptive  level all the way up through the graph, it may also be desirable to group together the annotation terms within each branch in the ontology graph that share the same genes and within these extract the most representative ontology  to exclude redundant representations. david functional ontology clustering accomplishes this task. the ontology analysis was run on each time profile with the total set of differentially expressed genes as background. the most representative term of each ontology cluster with a p-value below  <dig>  was extracted, shown in table  <dig>  it is clear from this analysis that profiles 1- <dig> and  <dig>  all signified by a late down-regulation, have several overlapping terms. among the over-represented ontologies defined by the down-regulated genes contained in each of these clusters, we find "cell-cell adhesion" and "zinc finger" shared between profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  ontologies relating to ribosomal processes shared in profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  and ontologies relating to metabolic processes shared in profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  profile  <dig> contains genes that seem to be involved in mitochondrial energy production  and regulation of anion concentrations and signaling. there are some terms in cluster profiles 1- <dig> that also seem to indicate a down-regulation of mitochondrial processes and overall metabolism. the profiles signified by an up-regulation of transcripts somewhere along the time profile  engage in different processes from those observed for cluster profiles 1- <dig> and  <dig>  profile  <dig> represents an early response of up-regulated genes primarily seen two days post injury involving processes of immunological and inflammatory responses. profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  though being similar in their expression pattern, have little overlap in their over-represented ontologies. profile  <dig> seems to reflect activation of a broad repertoire of kinase signaling pathways as well as modification of the ribosomal machinery, which might correlate with the only over-represented term in profile  <dig>  indicating a positive regulation of the transcriptional machinery relating to polymerase ii. profiles 8- <dig> all seem to contain ontologies relating to membrane bound activities such as active transport and neuronal signaling as well ontologies pertaining to engagement into neuronal developmental processes.

in conclusion, the ontology analysis ascribes several general functions to each time profile identifying their timing across the injury response and suggesting a common regulatory control of these.

differential expression of genes affecting motor neuron excitability
while the ontology analysis may identify general terms subject to regulation, a manifest focus of our study was to correlate changes in gene expression that can be linked to increased motor neuron excitability and injury-induced spasticity. in a previous study we examined the late  transcriptional response of motor neurons to their sham-operated counterpart  <cit> . that study focused on changes in three main categories: ion channels, receptors of neurotransmitters and intracellular pathways capable of modulating these. here we extract the same categories of significantly differentially expressed genes. these genes are shown in table  <dig> along with the cluster identity. the majority of these differentially expressed genes are identical to the genes reported in our previous study  <cit> , with the two primary differences being that in the present case they are, 1) identified based on their differential expression across time as opposed to a static comparison to their sham-operated counterpart at each time point and 2) each gene is associated with a pattern of expression over time. most importantly, we thus identify the same gene candidates subject to regulation with two different strategies for the choice of reference, supporting the robustness of our findings. but, in contrast to the static study , the dynamic response over time now enables us to expand our analysis and start unraveling some of the underlying regulatory mechanism shaping the observed patterns of gene expression within each cluster profile.

to summarize the regulation of genes directly relating to motor neuron excitability, we find that most of the neuromodulator pathways  seem to have a response of late up-regulation  while inhibitory neurotransmitter pathways  are in general down-regulated in the late phase of the injury response . the time series analysis also reveals regulation of genes coding for serotonergic  and adrenergic  receptors, which were not seen in the analysis of the late injury response  <cit>  because they belong to time profile  <dig> with an initial suppression followed by a return to control levels. other adrenergic receptor related genes overlap in the two studies, alpha 1d adrenoreceptor  and beta-adrenergic receptor kinase  <dig>  being up-regulated in the late phase. the dopamine reuptake transporter dat  together with the gene coding for the dopamine receptor  <dig>  are up-regulated while a gene coding for the dopamine interacting protein caly  is down-regulated. the gene coding for dopamine receptor  <dig>  is subject to early down-regulation  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury, but returns to control levels in the late phase  <dig> days post injury. as in the preceding study  <cit>  we find genes coding for gabaa subunits involved in channel trafficking and membrane incorporation to respond to the injury  in synergy with the down-regulation of the receptor subunits gabaa α <dig> , gabaa γ <dig>  and gabaa receptor β <dig> . one additional gene relating to gaba transmission is down-regulated, the gabab receptor  <dig> .

the time analysis showed in accordance with  <cit>  that the glutamatergic receptors seem to undergo a complex regulation, where several genes coding for different components of the nmda receptor undergo regulation in late stages: grinl  and grina  are up-regulated and grinlla  is down-regulated. grin3b also belong to the nmda receptor complex, but seems to undergo early modulation with early down-regulation and a return to control levels in late phases . the gene coding for the ampa receptor regulator protein tarp is up-regulated , profile 10), suggesting an increased ampa receptor mediated conductance.

with respect to the cholinergic system the time series analysis revealed similar patterns as was seen in the analysis of the late injury response  <cit> , all genes being up-regulated in the late phases of the response. the up-regulation of genes coding for nicotinic alpha receptors  <dig> and  <dig>  together with the receptor subunit delta  suggest an increased sensitivity to acetylcholine, while the up-regulation of the genes coding for vesicular acetylcholine transporter  as well as for nrg <dig>  know to be involved in synaptic maturation suggest and increased release of acetylcholine.

among the voltage gated ion channels, genes coding for ca2+ and na+ channel subunits are largely up-regulated in the late phase, while genes relating to k+ have a more complex response with a balanced up- and down regulation of channel subunits. the genes coding for the ca2+ channel α subunits cav <dig> , cav <dig>  and the γ <dig> subunit  are up-regulated in the late phase of the injury response, while only the gene coding for the ca2+ channel subunit β <dig>  exhibit a late down-regulation. several genes of the na+ subunits also undergo regulation, where the genes coding for na+ a subunits nav <dig>  and nav <dig>  together with the β <dig> subunit  exhibit late up-regulation, while only the gene coding for the a subunit nav <dig>   is down-regulated. both the genes coding for the a subunit nav <dig>   and the β <dig> subunit  belong to profile  <dig> with an early up-regulation and a return to control levels in the late phases. ca2+ binding proteins also exhibit a trend towards late phase up-regulation, i.e. cam kinase related genes  as well as one ip <dig> receptor  and the ca2+ binding protein caldendrin  are up-regulated. two genes relating to calmodulin and cam kinase  are transiently down-regulated in the early injury response, returning to control levels in the late part of the injury-response. the cl- reversal potential also seems to be subject to regulation towards a more depolarizing effect, suggested by the down-regulation of the gene coding for the cl- transporter nkcc <dig>  responsible for cl- extrusion and the up-regulation of the gene coding for the cl- symporters ae <dig> and ae <dig>  involved in cl-accumulation inside the cell.

the transcriptional regulation exerted by differentially expressed transcription factors
the common expression patterns of each consensus cluster suggest a common regulatory control of their associated genes. to reveal such common regulatory control, we looked for over-representation of transcription factor dna binding sites in their proximal promoter regions, here set to  <dig> base pairs  upstream and  <dig> bp downstream of the coding region.

we focused the analysis on transcription factors that were associated with genes that exhibit differential expression in the time series. we find  <dig> genes coding for transcription factors to be differentially expressed in our data set out of the  <dig> transcription factor genes contained on the rat <dig>  <dig> chip. these genes are listed in table  <dig> along with their cluster identity. to evaluate if these factors are likely to exert an influence on the regulation of the genes in each cluster, we predict their binding sites in respective gene promoters using computational models . over-represented binding sites suggest a possible role for the corresponding transcription factor in the regulation of the tested set of genes. for this analysis we use asap  <cit>  with position weight matrices  obtained from either jaspar  <cit>  or transfac  <cit>  and the set of differentially expressed gene promoter sequences as background.

deg tf: differentially expressed genes  of transcription factors . genes of tf with annotated transfac motifs are highlighted in boldface. tf over-rep: tfs with over-represented binding sites in the set of genes belonging to the specified gene cluster. motifs: individual transfac motifs with z scores above  <dig> based on asap conducted on the set of genes belonging to the specified gene cluster.

there is presently little overlap between the transcription factors associated with the genes included on the rat <dig>  <dig> chip and the two databases containing their binding motifs, only  <dig> overlap with transfac and  <dig> with jaspar . of these transcription factors , the ones associated with genes that do not display differential expression were excluded from the analysis, reducing the two sets of transcription factors to six for transfac  and two for jaspar . we therefore used the transfac motifs for the promoter analysis. because many of the tranfac motifs describe the same factor, this analysis includes  <dig> motifs. patterns with a substantial enrichments are reported , since these are likely to exert an influence in the regulation of the gene clusters, table  <dig>  under-represented binding motifs signify that the corresponding transcription factor is very unlikely to exert any regulatory influence on the gene cluster under examination .

to illustrate the balance between over- and under-representation of binding sites across gene clusters we next take advantage of the continuous range of z scores, instead of only treating them as binary classifiers . in combination across the gene clusters these values say something about the regulatory landscape, i.e. what binding sites are unchanged in most clusters, and what factors can explain the difference between clusters? we choose to visualize this as a hierarchical heatmap, where rows constitute the motif models and columns the gene clusters. in this representation the z scores are organized by two-way hierarchical clustering, such that motifs that behave similarly in terms of over-representation will cluster together, as will the gene clusters with similar bindings site landscapes, figure 3a. for plotting purposes each z score vector  was normalized to unit variance. the heatmap of z scores shows a clear pattern separating the expression profiles into groups sharing over-represented  as well as under-represented  sites. motifs whose sites are over-represented in the group of clusters 1- <dig> are under-represented in the other major group clusters 6- <dig>  and vise versa. the patterns of transcription factor binding site over- and under-representation are not identical for each of the consensus clusters, perhaps alluding to some degree of specific regulation within each cluster. cluster profiles  <dig> and  <dig> have slightly separate motif binding patterns, though resembling clusters 6- <dig> and 1- <dig>  respectively. the first two principal components of the z score vectors of each time profile also reflect this clear separation, again reproducing the relationships obtained from the consensus clustering , where profiles 1- <dig> and 6- <dig> group together, while clusters  <dig> and  <dig> are somewhat separated from these two main groups of regulation, figure 3b.

by comparing the expression pattern of the differentially expressed genes coding for transcription factors  with the time profile of the clusters where their binding sites are over-represented  some general picture emerges. the differentially expressed genes of sp <dig>  and e2f <dig>  belong to cluster  <dig>  which show an early up-regulation that is maintained throughout the injury response. the pattern of binding site over-representation suggests that sp <dig> may have an auto regulatory role, as its binding sites are over-represented in cluster profiles 6- <dig> and under-represented in cluster profiles 1- <dig> and  <dig>  it thus seems to enhance expression of genes in clusters 6- <dig>  the pattern of over-representation for the binding site of e2f <dig> on the other hand suggest that this transcription factor has a very broad activation potential as it seems to target clusters  <dig>   <dig> and 6- <dig>  the expression of the gene coding for foxo <dig>  follows time profile  <dig>  and the over-represented binding sites of this transcription factor in clusters 1- <dig> and  <dig> suggests that it suppress the expression of genes in these clusters as they are mainly down-regulated. the gene of transcription factor atf <dig>  belongs to cluster profile  <dig> showing a late up-regulation. the binding sites of atf <dig> are over-represented in cluster profile  <dig> so its late expression may be involved in the late suppression of genes in cluster profile  <dig>  cluster profile  <dig> on the other hand contains two differentially expressed genes coding for transcription factors, myc  and atf <dig> . the binding sites of myc are over-represented in the promoters of genes belonging to cluster profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  this could indicate a role for myc in the positive regulation in the early response  of cluster profiles 6- <dig>  while it would have the opposite effect suppressing the expression of genes in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . as the genes of cluster profile  <dig> reside to control levels in the late phase of the injury response , it seems unlikely that transcription factors following this time profile exert any effect on gene regulation at these late time points. the binding sites of atf <dig> are over-represented in profiles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that this transcription factor affects the early up-regulation in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> while the profile of cluster  <dig> doesn't seem to undergo any significant regulation at these time points compared to control . as for transcription factor myc it seems likely that atf <dig> participate in the suppression of gene expression in the early response in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> 

this analysis showed that although we could only ascribe motifs to  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factors encoded by differentially expressed genes, the complex correlation between the timing of their gene expression and the down- or up-regulation of their putative cluster targets suggests an intricate interaction between the transcription factors in shaping the transcriptional response.

discussion
excitability changes in motor neurons have been strongly implicated with the emergence of pathophysiological hyper-reflexia in late stages of spinal cord injury, since self-sustained activity can be induced in motor neurons upon brief stimuli of sensory afferents in the complete absence of descending fibers from the brain  <cit> . by focusing on the transcriptional time course of these cells in combination with transcription factor motif analysis we shed light on the regulatory mechanisms underlying the re-expression of these plateau potentials, a key mechanism behind the pathophysiology of spasticity. in particular, we use a robust consensus cluster algorithm  <cit>  to identify distinct expression time profiles. this consensus cluster algorithm conducted on the  <dig>  most differentially expressed genes identified  <dig> distinct time profiles. these expression time profiles separate the differentially expressed genes into groups that most likely are under common regulatory control and enable us to associate individual genes with a specific pattern of expression over time.

cluster analysis identify distinct time profiles that define the timing of general biological responses to injury
the  <dig> time profiles divide into two main groups relating to the late response, one of down-regulation  and one of up-regulation , figure 1b and 1c. besides these two main categories of late regulation expression patterns there are two clusters with a predominant early response, time profile  <dig> with an early up-regulation at day  <dig> and time profile  <dig> with an early down-regulation at days  <dig> and  <dig>  which both falls back towards control levels  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury.

ontology analysis of the genes associated with each cluster profile shows that the motor neurons engage in different biological processes as the transcriptional response evolves over time. in particular time profile  <dig> signifies a marked immunological and inflammatory response of the motor neurons in the early phase after injury, which return to control levels in the late phases. such immunological processes are known to be pronounced in the early phase of spinal cord injury from studies conducted on entire spinal cord tissue  <cit> , but have not previously been identified at the motor neuron level. this finding corroborate recent studies, indicating that a neuronal immune response is included in the repertoire of processes motor neurons can engage as a means of protection against damage  <cit> . cluster profiles 1- <dig> as well as  <dig> all describe different patterns of transcript down-regulation. "cell-cell adhesion" is clearly down-regulated in profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that the direct interaction of motor neurons with their neighboring cells are reduced. synapse stripping, including the removal of synapses from the perikaryon and dendrites, is a pronounced phenomenon after axonal damage to motor neurons  <cit> . the down-regulation of genes related to "ensheathment of neurons" in cluster profile  <dig> suggests an effect of the injury on the myelination of motor neurons not previously associated with this neuronal population. another prominent down-regulated mechanism involves mitochondrial related energy metabolism . the translational machinery is also down-regulated . the down-regulation of chromatin structures  suggests that the dna could be unfolding towards a more favorable transcriptional state, while "rna splicing" of profile  <dig> suggests a reduction in the mrna processing. among the prominent up-regulated profiles, pathways relating to neuronal development , suggest that injury induce developmental processes as a late response. this finding indicates that a differentiated and mature neural population in the spinal cord is capable of re-engaging in developmental pathways, presumably attempting to ameliorate the conditions of the damaged spinal cord and compensate for the lack of inputs. it is also clear that plasma membrane transporter activity of various kinds are significantly up-regulated suggesting a very strong control of the electro-chemical transmembrane gradients, possibly also reflecting the changing chemical requirements of the motor neurons. the motor neurons also up-regulate processes directly relating to membrane excitability and neural transmission, suggesting that the motor neurons change their synaptic strength, both pre-synaptically through modulation of axon terminals with increased machinery for acetylcholine release and post-synaptically through modulation of receptor channels as well as changed membrane excitability.

differentially expressed genes relating to motor neuron excitability and injury-induced spasticity
ontology analysis provides general terms of activity suggesting some biological functions of each cluster profile, but the over-represented ontologies only represent a relative small proportion of the genes contained in each cluster. to dissect out all the gene constituents that relate to changes in motor neuron excitability and injury-induced spasticity we therefore focused on genes involved in neural transmission. in a previous study we examined the late transcriptional response of motor neurons compared to their sham-operated counterparts  <dig> and  <dig> days post injury  <cit> . from this study it was clear that the motor neurons change their post-synaptic receptor composition moving towards a more excitable state through a reduction of the ionotropic gabaergic receptors and an increase of the ionotropic glutamatergic, adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. ca2+ and na+ ion channels also responded to the injury, where the most noticeable changes related to the modulation of persistent inward currents involved the ancillary subunits possibly changing the conductivity and membrane incorporation of existing ion channels. the functional consequences of these changes are discussed extensively in  <cit> .

extracting the differentially expressed genes affecting motor neuron excitability based on their changed expression over time identifies many of the same candidates, though the differential expression in the present case is based on mutual reference across the time points rather than pair wise comparisons within each time point with time-matched sham controls. the fact that the two different strategies of analysis identify many of the same gene candidates affecting motor neuron excitability supports the robustness of our findings. the time series analysis clearly shows that most of the genes relating to motor neuron excitability and injury-induced spasticity are found in clusters with late regulation, where genes coding for receptors and channels with excitatory effects are predominantly up-regulated while inhibitory receptors are primarily down-regulated. this shows that the observed progressive increase of the hyper-reflexia strongly correlates with the increased expression of genes enhancing motor neuron excitability and reversely correlates with the decreasing expression of the gabaa receptor system. this pattern of expression was also reflected in the ontology analysis, where late phase up-regulation of time profiles  <dig> and  <dig> contains terms of "gated channel activity", "regulation of neurotransmitter levels", "synaptic transmission" and "ion exchanger activity", while time profile  <dig> showing a general down-regulation as a response to the injury contains "alkali metal ion binding" and "anion channel activity" reflecting a decrease in anion channel signaling .

the apparent conclusion from this analysis is that many of the genes affecting motor neuron excitability share expression patterns, where the majority having an excitatory effect are up-regulated in late stages of the injury response  falling into clusters 6- <dig> while the majority of the genes relating to inhibition are down-regulated in the late phases of the response falling into cluster profiles 1- <dig> and  <dig> 

transcriptional control of gene clusters
the distinct expression pattern shared by the genes of each consensus cluster and their associated ontology terms suggest a common regulatory control of each gene cluster. this possibility was examined by matching transcription factor binding sites with core promoter sequences of the genes associated with each cluster using asap  <cit>  with motifs obtained from the transfac database. this database is at present not fully annotated for all know transcriptions factors, and at the time of writing transfac contained motifs for  <dig> of the  <dig> transcription factors encoded by genes identified in the present study as differentially expressed . based on over-representation analysis of their binding sites we find that the expression pattern for the genes of these six transcription factors correlate nicely with the time profiles of their putative target gene clusters. the genes of sp <dig> , e2f <dig>  and foxo <dig>  all belong to time profile  <dig> with a common up-regulation throughout the injury response, but have different targets clusters.

the binding sites of sp <dig> are over-represented in profiles 6- <dig> suggesting a positive regulation by this transcription factor of the genes associated with these profiles. the binding sites of e2f <dig> are over-represented in gene clusters  <dig>   <dig> and 6- <dig> suggesting the interaction of this transcription factor with other proteins to focus its regulatory effect to fewer transcript targets. interestingly the non-specific general activator proteins sp <dig> and e2f <dig> have been shown to interact to promote transcription  <cit>  and in motor neurons they can drive the transcription of the motor neuron specific transcription factor hb <dig>  <cit> . their common binding site over-representation in cluster profiles 6- <dig> therefore suggest that they participate in a general activation of transcription of their associated genes.

the binding sites of foxo <dig> are over-represented in cluster profiles 1- <dig> plus  <dig> and it thus seems to have a suppressive effect. the fork-head transcription factor foxo <dig> has not previously been associated with the spinal cord, but it has been found in other parts of the developing and adult brain  <cit> .

atf <dig> and atf <dig> both belong to the mammalian activation transcription factor/camp responsive element-binding  protein family of transcription factors and they have both been associated with trauma relating to the spinal cord. atf <dig> has been shown to be up-regulated in motor and sensory neurons subject to axotomy  <cit>  as well as in spinal neurons post injury  <cit> . the up-regulation of atf <dig> has been associated with ischemia of both brain and spinal cord  <cit> . the genes of these two transcription factors follow different expression profiles. the gene of atf <dig>  belongs to expression profile  <dig> and thus is subject to an initial repression followed by a late up-regulation. the binding site of atf <dig> is over-represented in time profile  <dig> suggesting that its late expression is suppressing the genes of cluster  <dig> as they return to control levels after the initial up-regulation. since the gene of atf <dig>  belongs to cluster  <dig> it therefore seems to be subject to the repression of atf <dig>  the early up-regulation of the gene coding for atf <dig>  on the other hand might correlate with initial up-regulation of expression in clusters with over-representation of its binding site, clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the binding site of atf <dig> is also over-represented in gene clusters  <dig> and  <dig> with early down-regulation of expression, thus atf <dig> must work together with other transcription factors to explain this apparent opposing effect on the expression of its target genes.

myc, a member of the myc-family of transcription factors, is a complex regulator of general transcriptional activation  <cit>  and has been associated with immediate early injury response of neurons in the spinal cord  <cit> . the gene of this transcription factor belongs to cluster profile  <dig> together with the gene of atf <dig>  the binding site for myc is over-represented in gene clusters 6- <dig> and 10- <dig> suggesting a role in the early regulation of the genes in these clusters.

the motif analysis could not be conducted on the full set of transcription factors with differential expression of their associated genes as not all of these were contained in transfac, which otherwise would have enabled us to make a more complete estimate of the regulatory network underlying the expression patterns observed in the motor neurons as a response to the injury. apart from the six transcription factors with know motifs, we note that several of the other transcription factors with differential expression of their associated genes have been implicated with central nervous system development or its response to trauma. these include the down-regulated genes of the transcription factors e2f <dig>   <cit> , gt2d <dig>   <cit>  and nfia   <cit>  as well as the up-regulated genes of transcription factors pbx <dig>   <cit>  and nrf2f   <cit> . in particular olig <dig> and nkx6- <dig> have been implicated in motor neuron differentiation early in development  <cit> . the down-regulation of their genes  compared to the un-injured state also suggests a role for these in the maintenance of normal motor neuron function and identity.

there is growing supporting evidence for a model where the pattern of neurogenesis is achieved through a mechanism of controlled repression of transcription upon a background of non-specific transcriptional activation  <cit> . it therefore seems like the developing nervous system is subject to general transcriptional activation by non-specific general-activator transcription factors while the cell specific processes are directed by controlled inhibition of transcription. if this mechanism applies to the adult organism, and in particular to the injury response of motor neurons observed in the present case, the down-regulation of a suppressor transcription factor could have the same effect as the up-regulation of a transcription factor enhancer targeting the same genes, i.e. induce transcription. the expression pattern of the genes coding for sp <dig>  e2f <dig> and myc together with their broad cluster targets suggest that these un-specific activators of transcription enhance the general transcriptional capacity of the motor neurons, while the expression pattern of genes coding for other more specific regulators of transcription like olig <dig> or nkx6- <dig> could function to shape the response by relief or activation of targeted suppression of specific sets of genes, supporting the hypothesis of suppressor mediated transcriptional specificity.

the observed combination of up- and down-regulated transcription factors therefore suggests a redirection of the transcriptional program, where the transcription factors of clusters 1- <dig> and  <dig> must be involved in the maintenance of normal motor neuron function and their down-regulation together with the up-regulated transcription factors of cluster profiles 5- <dig> suggest a dynamic transition to a new transcriptional state. it is also clear from our analysis that these transitions through different transcriptional states across time are mediated by the interactions of several transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study expand our previous work on the late transcriptional response of motor neurons following spinal cord injury by adding data from the early phase, resulting in a data set comprising days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post injury. the consensus clustering with the subsequent ontology analysis enabled us to identify distinct expression time profiles from which we can describe the biological processes as they progress over time and correlate them to the pathophysiologal development of spinal cord injury. extracting genes directly relating to motor neuron excitability further focus the analysis towards changes associated with injury-induced hyper-reflexia. the cluster identity of these genes in complement with the over-representation analysis on go terms and transcription factor binding sites indicate some general mechanism of how the motor neurons regulate their membrane excitability as a response to the injury.

our analysis clearly suggests that the transcriptional response of the motor neurons to injury is complex, and that the observed increased excitability is the result of many interacting factors. this study therefore provides a first step towards an understanding of the correlation between the transcriptional regulation in an individual cell population and the physiological state of a biologically complex system. in this light it therefore seems unlikely that the suppression of a single gene or protein relating to ion channels or receptors will have a significant effect in reducing motor neuron excitability to alleviate injury-induced spasticity. we therefore suggest an alternative approach, where the manipulation of the transcriptional regulators such as the identified transcription factors could be used to alter the transcriptional response to prevent the motor neurons from entering a state of hyper-excitability.
