BACKGROUND
the genus roseobacter comprises the two species roseobacter litoralis och <dig> and roseobacter denitrificans och <dig>  both species were isolated from marine seaweed and were the first described organisms of the roseobacter clade  <cit> . r. denitrificans is able to grow anaerobically using nitrate or trimethyl-n-oxide  as electron acceptors  <cit> , whereas r. litoralis showed no denitrifying activity  <cit> . r. denitrificans and r. litoralis as well as some other members of the clade have the ability to use light energy and perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis  <cit> . in r. litoralis, the photosynthesis genes are located on a plasmid, which is unusual for aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs   <cit> .

the genome sequences of more than  <dig> roseobacter clade members are available, but only five of them are finished  <cit> . the genome sequence of roseobacter denitrificans och <dig> was published in  <dig> by swingley and co-workers  <cit>  and was the first genome of an aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium. the absence of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and phosphoribulokinase supports the assumption that aanps do not fix carbon dioxide via the krebs-cycle. genes coding for other anaplerotic enzymes were found in the genome of r. denitrificans and the importance of mixotrophic growth was evident  <cit> .

plasmid-encoded functions are of great interest in genome analysis because plasmids often provide exchangeable niche specific fitness factors. heavy metal resistances, e.g., are often encoded by plasmids  <cit>  and are important for marine organisms as heavy metals accumulate in sediments  <cit> , in macroalgae  <cit>  but also in other aquatic organisms  <cit> . consequently, many of the sequenced roseobacter clade members harbour plasmids, but due to the fact that the majority of the sequences are not finished, not much is known about these plasmids. however, it is assumed that translocation processes between chromosomes and plasmids occur frequently  <cit> .

the aims of our study were the genome characterization, comparative genomics and genome-guided physiological analysis of r. litoralis, the type strain of the genus roseobacter. the genome of r. litoralis was compared to the genome of the closely related r. denitrificans as well as to  <dig> genomes of other members of the roseobacter clade. metabolic pathways were reconstructed and verified by physiological tests. heavy metal tolerance tests with both roseobacter species were performed to confirm differences of the species indicated by genomic data. furthermore, insights into the regulation mechanism of the photosynthetic activity of r. litoralis are given.

RESULTS
general genomic features and comparison of the two roseobacter species

the manually curated and annotated final genome sequence of r. litoralis och <dig> comprises a chromosome with the size of  <dig> , <dig> bp and three plasmids of  <dig>  bp ,  <dig>  bp  and  <dig>  bp , respectively . the genome encodes  <dig> predicted genes. the average g+c content of the genome is  <dig> %. according to reciprocal blast analysis, the two roseobacter species share a core genome consisting of  <dig> genes . the chromosomes of the two organisms have been subject to many genomic rearrangements that are evident in the chromosomal alignment . of the  <dig> unique genes  of r. litoralis,  <dig> are located on plasmids. in r. denitrificans,  <dig>  genes are unique of which  <dig> are plasmid-encoded. many of the unique genes on the chromosomes occur in genomic islands , but a variety of species-specific genes are scattered over the chromosomes. according to clusters of orthologous groups  -categories, the majority of these genes are involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. the unique genes with assigned function of r. litoralis and r. denitrificans are listed in additional file  <dig> 

data for r. denitrificans according to the ncbi database  <cit> 

genomic islands
ten geis were identified on the chromosome of r. litoralis  making up ~ <dig> kb . in r. denitrificans, in contrast, only ~ <dig> kb  were identified as genomic islands. the excess of  <dig> kb of alien genetic material in r. litoralis corresponds to the larger chromosome size  of the organism. thus, the additional genetic material of r. litoralis was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer.

typically, geis contain a g+c content and a codon adaptation index  different from the average  <cit> . furthermore, transposases within the islands and trnas flanking the geis are indicators for translocation processes  <cit> . many of the genes located in geis are of unknown function and several do not exhibit significant similarities to other genes in the databases . these orphan genes are thought to be phage-derived genetic material  <cit> . although no complete prophages are present in the genome of r. litoralis, in some of the islands phage-like genes were identified, e.g. in island  <dig> three putative phage tail proteins are located .

in other geis, however, genes were identified that were probably derived from other bacterial species. frequently, amino acid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes are present in the geis, providing r. litoralis with additional abilities for substrate utilization. for example island  <dig> contains genes for rhamnose transport and degradation  that have been described in rhizobia  <cit> . genes involved in nitrogen metabolism were identified in islands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> including different amidases , a second uncommon urease gene cluster  and assimilatory nitrite and nitrate reductases . island  <dig> contains a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase encoding gene , which is not present in r. denitrificans. the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase was believed to be common in the roseobacter clade, as all members contain the corresponding genes  <cit> . however, recently it was shown that only a small proportion of roseobacter clade members, among those r. litoralis, are able to oxidise carbon monoxide and that a wide variety lacks an essential subunit of the codh-complex  <cit> . r. denitrificans is not able to oxidise carbon monoxide, but instead, has genes coding for a nitrate reductase that enables the organism to reduce nitrate under anaerobic growth conditions. island  <dig> contains genes for coenzyme pqq biosynthesis  that are also located in a gei of r. denitrificans. in island  <dig>  genes for antigen biosynthesis were identified, e.g. udp-n-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase wecb  and udp-4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose--oxoglutarate aminotransferase arnb . the latter is also similar to the perosamine synthetase from brucella melitensis, with gdp-perosamine being part of the o-antigen of the organism  <cit> . antigens are polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides that define the structure of the bacterial cell surface. genes important for cell envelope biosynthesis are often found in islands of environmental bacteria  <cit> . the cell surface structure is important for biofilm formation and host association of the organisms and structural alteration can provide niche adaption and phage defence  <cit> .

unique genes on plasmids
several species-specific genes, of which the majority is associated with heavy metal resistance , are located on plasmid prlo149_ <dig>  therefore, the two roseobacter species were compared with respect to zinc and copper tolerance. r. litoralis showed a higher tolerance of zinc, whereas r. denitrificans showed a higher copper tolerance. r. litoralis could grow without impairment up to  <dig>  mm of zinc, but was inhibited in its growth in the presence of low copper concentrations . in contrast, r. denitrificans could not grow with  <dig>  mm zinc added to the medium, but was able to grow with  <dig>  mm of copper. the higher zinc tolerance of r. litoralis could be due to the zn-cpx-type atpase and/or the putative cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein czcd , a member of the cation diffusion efflux  family  <cit> . substrates of cdf proteins can be various cations  <cit> , but mainly zn2+-transporting cdfs such as zitb from escherichia coli  <cit>  are also known.

the proteins are categorized into different heavy metal efflux protein families. based on sequence similarities the metal ions most likely transported by the efflux systems are indicated in column  <dig>  hme-rnd, heavy metal efflux - resistance-nodulation-cell division protein family; cdf, cation diffusion efflux proteins.

most of the other putative heavy metal resistance genes on plasmid prlo149_ <dig> have weak similarities to known copper and silver efflux proteins . but since no higher copper tolerance of r. litoralis compared to r. denitrificans was observed, the efflux systems might be involved in transport of other cations. two other members of the roseobacter clade, dinoroseobacter shibae dfl- <dig> and roseovarius nubinhibens ism, have orthologous heavy metal resistance genes on their plasmids .

plasmids are important mobile genetic elements and therefore often contain recently acquired genetic material. thus, the occurrence of species-specific and also alien genes on two of the plasmids  was not surprising. plasmid prlo149_ <dig>  however, is an exception as no alien genes or genomic islands were identified on the plasmid. nearly the entire genetic information of prlo149_ <dig> was found on the chromosome of r. denitrificans, with approximately  <dig> kb being syntenic. also in r. denitrificans the area was not identified as gei. only nine orfs on the plasmid are not present in the genome of r. denitrificans. the genes for the photosynthetic apparatus comprise ~ <dig> kb and are part of the syntenic area with the plasmid replication genes located amidst the photosynthesis genes in r. litoralis . the remaining  <dig> kb that are syntenic in both organisms are located upstream of the photosynthesis genes in r. denitrificans and encode other functions. the genes downstream of the syntenic region to plasmid prlo149_ <dig> in r. denitrificans are also present in r. litoralis and are located approximately  <dig> kb upstream of dnaa. at the position on the chromosome of r. litoralis that corresponds to the position of the first gene associated with the photosynthesis apparatus of r. denitrificans  several transposases are encoded , suggesting this region to be a genomic hot spot. these findings suggest a translocation of the genetic material from the chromosome to the plasmid. this is further supported by the fact that photosynthesis genes are usually located on the chromosomes of aanps  <cit>  and are thought to be rather vertically than horizontally acquired genetic material in roseobacter clade bacteria  <cit> .

comparison with other members of the roseobacter clade
to identify the genes specific for the genus roseobacter, the genomes of both species were compared to  <dig> genomes of other roseobacter clade bacteria. the results of the comparison are shown for two representatives of each phylogenetic subgroup of the roseobacter clade outlined by newton et al.  <cit>  in figure  <dig>  six hypervariable regions , areas of low conservation in the roseobacter-clade, were found adjacent to the genomic islands predicted on the chromosome of r. litoralis . the hvrs of r. litoralis are characterized by a mosaic-like structure, with regions conserved in all roseobacter clade bacteria alternating with genus-unique but also species-unique genes. frequently, trnas were found flanking the hvrs, but not many transposases were present inside the areas indicating that the regions are permanently anchored in the chromosome  <cit> . the g+c-content and also the codon-adaptation index vary inside the hvrs.

of special interest is hvr i as many genes identified in this area seem to be connected to the relation of r. litoralis to the algal host. for example, several genes for the degradation and transport of algal osmolytes like taurine  and sarcosine  were identified in hvr i. furthermore, the genes for vitamin b <dig> biosynthesis  are present. vitamin b <dig> was shown to be important for the symbiosis of d. shibae with its dinoflagellate host  <cit> . a degradation pathway of erythritol is also located in hvr i . the pathway is only present in r. litoralis and r. denitrificans and is known from rhizobia  <cit> . in rhizobium leguminosarum erythritol catabolism is important for competitiveness of the organism in the nodulation of pea plants  <cit> . thus, erythritol catabolism might also be associated with the algal host relation of the roseobacter species. the mosaic-like structure of hvr i resembles the symbiosis islands of rhizobia  <cit> . two different areas can be identified on the chromosome of r. denitrificans that correspond to hvr i of r. litoralis. in the alignment of the chromosomes of the two species, the hvrs of the two organisms form an x-like structure  which is probably due to the tendency of genes in closely related organisms to be located in the same distance from the origin  <cit> .

uncharacterized sugar and amino acid transporters are frequently found in the hvrs, e.g. in hvrs ii and v. genes for glucoside  and galactose/arabinose  transport and degradation as well as an arsenite resistance system  are located in hvr iii. the genes for sulfur oxidation  and the denitrification genes  were identified in hvr iv. due to the lack of the nitrate reductase in r. litoralis the organism is not able to reduce nitrate; however, genes encoding all other enzymes required for denitrification are present. thus, it is possible that the organism is able to reduce nitrite to molecular nitrogen under anoxic conditions. hvr v contains genes for formaldehyde degradation that are more common in the mixotrophic than in the heterotrophic group of roseobacter clade members  <cit> .

rfb-genes and host association
a rfb-gene cluster essential for the development of o-antigens, i.e. lipopolysaccharides of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , was identified on plasmid prlo149_ <dig> of r. litoralis. many of the roseobacter clade bacteria have rfb-genes in their genomes and in about half of those the genes are located on plasmids. in r. denitrificans the rfb-gene cluster is encoded on a plasmid of  <dig> kb , a size similar to prlo149_ <dig>  approximately 50% of the genes on ptb <dig> and prlo149_ <dig> are orthologs . the remaining parts contain unique genes for each organism, and many of these are associated with cell envelope biosynthesis. these findings suggest that the plasmids are important for the cell surface structure of the two roseobacter species and may have originated from a common ancestor.

in e. coli the o-antigens are known to interact with the host defences and are therefore important virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . many other roseobacter clade bacteria with plasmid-located rfb-genes were also isolated from surfaces of algal or animal hosts. therefore, we investigated whether a correlation between the replicon location of the rfb-genes and host-association exists. the genome sequences of marine rhodobacterales species available in the img database  <cit>  were searched for rfb-genes and the replicon location was determined if possible . for the unfinished genomes, co-occurrence of plasmid replication genes with the rfb-genes on the same dna-contig was regarded as an indicator for plasmid localisation. chromosome location was confirmed by rrna clusters or chromosome partitioning genes on the dna-contigs that harbour the rfb-genes. in  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes rfb-genes were present and their location could be identified. chromosomal rfb-genes were found in  <dig> organisms and  <dig> of those were isolated from the water column. nine of the  <dig> plasmid-located rfb-gene clusters were found in organisms that were isolated either from host surfaces, aquacultures, algae blooms or the like. thus, the replicon analysis of the rfb-genes of  <dig> of the  <dig> organisms supports the hypothesis that plasmid-location of the rfb-genes is coherent with host-association of roseobacter clade bacteria.

photosynthesis
to confirm the functionality of the plasmid-encoded photosynthesis apparatus in r. litoralis, the photosynthetic activity of the strain was measured via oxygen consumption . whereas almost no reaction to light was observed during growth, cells in the stationary growth phase were highly responsive to light and showed a reduced respiration rate when exposed to light . even though pigmentation occurred already during the exponential growth phase, the organism did not use the photosynthetic apparatus until the culture reached the stationary growth phase. the use, but not the expression, of the photosynthesis apparatus might therefore be influenced by nutrient availability in r. litoralis, as stationary phase cultures are nutrient depleted. we obtained similar results for r. denitrificans, with cells in the late stationary phase showing a stronger response to light than cells from the exponential growth phase . for the alpha-proteobacteria labrenzia alexandrii dfl- <dig> and hoeflea phototrophica dfl- <dig> periodic nutrient starvation has been reported to trigger bacteriochlorophyll-a production whereas only slight effects were observed for d. shibae  <cit> . obviously, the regulation mechanisms differ between the aerobic phototrophic bacteria and so does the architecture of their photosynthesis genes. in additional file  <dig>  the organization of the photosynthesis gene clusters of the organisms mentioned above is compared, showing that organisms with similar physiological traits also have similar gene organizations. the suggestion that the organization of genes within purple bacterial photosynthesis gene clusters reflects regulatory mechanisms, evolutionary history, and relationships between species was also made by other authors  <cit> . in the oligotrophic environment of the ocean, the use of the photosynthesis apparatus during nutrient depletion may be an important advantage for roseobacter species in the competition with non-photosynthetic organisms.

substrate tests and pathway reconstruction
growth on different substrates was tested for r. litoralis to substantiate the reconstruction of metabolic pathways based on the genomic analyses. the results of the growth experiments are shown in additional file  <dig>  for each substrate the growth characteristics of r. litoralis and the genomic data were combined and the putative degradation pathways for the substrates allowing growth are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  for the use of amino acids and amino acid derivatives, the predictions from the genome are mainly consistent with the experimentally achieved data . however, for the degradation of sugars, sugar derivatives and algal osmolytes, genomic and experimental data differ in several cases . selected examples are discussed below.

d-mannose and d-glucosamine
for d-mannose and d-glucosamine the process of phosphorylation could not be revealed from the genomic data . in other bacteria, a phosphotransferase system  mediates phosphorylation of monosaccharides already during transport . as for the majority of the roseobacter clade members, no complete pts is encoded in the genome of r. litoralis. present are genes for an eiia component, hpr and hprk, but no permease was identified. the function of the incomplete pts is to date unknown. it rather exhibits a regulatory function as proposed for the spirochaetes treponema pallidum and treponema denticola  <cit>  and as shown for sinorhizobium meliloti  <cit> , which also lack the permease component of the pts. therefore, a pts-independent system for transport and phosphorylation of d-mannose and d-glucosamine must be present in r. litoralis.

d-galactose, l-arabinose and d-fucose
r. litoralis grew with d-galactose, l-arabinose and d-fucose, but no complete pathways could be assigned to the degradation of these monosaccharides. a known mechanism for d-galactose degradation in bacteria is the deley-doudoroff pathway . parts of the dd-pathway are encoded in the genome of r. litoralis, namely the genes coding for 2-dehydro-3-deoxygalactokinase  and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase . the other genes required for the degradation of d-galactose via the dd-pathway are not present in this gene cluster . however, a gene with high similarity to galactose 1-dehydrogenase  that catalyzes the first step of the pathway  <cit>  was found elsewhere in the genome . this protein has also a high similarity to l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase of azospirillum brasilense. in this organism a pathway for l-arabinose degradation was described that is analogue to the dd-pathway for galactose degradation  <cit> . beside l-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase, also arabonate dehydratase of a. brasilense has an ortholog in r. litoralis  which is also located in cluster  <dig> . the other proteins of the pathway known in a. brasilense cannot be assigned to proteins of r. litoralis. thus, both pathways are incomplete in r. litoralis; however, if the two clusters are combined, a degradation mechanism based on the dd-pathway may be functional for both sugars . correspondingly, the regulators as well as the sugar-binding periplasmic protein of the transport system in cluster  <dig> are known to interact with d-galactose, l-arabinose and d-fucose  <cit> , and also other enzymes are known to act on all three sugars  <cit> . as no mechanism for d-fucose degradation was identified in the genome of r. litoralis and only weak growth was observed with this sugar, it is possible that the enzymes also act on d-fucose but with a lower affinity.

glycogen
r. litoralis was not able to grow with glycogen as a carbon source, probably due to the fact that no genes exist in the predicted secretome coding for extracellular glycogen cleavage enzymes, and also no putative transporters for glycogen were identified. intracellular glycogen, however, was detected in cells of both roseobacter species when grown in mineral medium. in contrast, no glycogen formation was observed when the cells were grown in complex medium. the glycogen biosynthesis and degradation genes in the two organisms are therefore probably involved in intracellular glycogen production under limiting conditions. the proposed pathway for glycogen metabolism in r. litoralis is shown in figure  <dig> 

glycogen formation is often induced by nitrogen starvation  <cit> ; however, both roseobacter species were not nitrogen-starved. thus, another limiting factor must be the inducer of glycogen production in the mineral medium.

in contrast to the other roseobacter clade members, in both roseobacter species the genes for glycogen biosynthesis and degradation are co-located with essential genes of the ed-pathway. it is known from other studies that roseobacter clade members use the ed-pathway for sugar breakdown  <cit> . the co-location of the genes coding for the ed-pathway with those of the glycogen biosynthesis and degradation indicates a close relation of the central carbon metabolism and glycogen storage in the roseobacter species.

algal osmolytes
the algal osmolytes tested in this study all served as carbon and nitrogen sources for both roseobacter species, except for dimethylglycine. additionally, r. litoralis used taurine as sulfur source. it was possible to reconstruct the pathways for algal osmolyte degradation from the genome of r. litoralis with the three exceptions creatinine, glycine betaine and putrescine .

creatinine
whereas the degradation mechanism for creatinine is clear in r. denitrificans, in r. litoralis the enzyme encoding the initial step of the pathway is not encoded in the genome . nevertheless, no differences were observed between the two organisms when grown on creatinine. furthermore, the enzymes mediating the second step of both possible pathways for creatinine degradation are present in the genome of r. litoralis . thus, the organism is able to degrade creatinine, but the mechanism cannot be completely reconstructed from the genome.

glycine betaine
the gene coding for the enzyme converting glycine betaine to dimethylglycine  was not identified in the genomes of the two roseobacter species. however, a potential candidate gene is rlo149_c <dig> which is co-located with the genes for dimethylglycine dehydrogenase  and a sarcosine dehydrogenase  that are both directly involved in osmolyte degradation  and are annotated according to eukaryotic enzymes. the domain homocysteine s-methyltransferase  that was identified in the protein sequence of rlo149_c <dig> is known to be part of mammalian bhmts  <cit> , but the predicted protein of r. litoralis shares only 26% identical amino acids with the mammalian enzymes . a similar orf  is encoded in the genome of r. denitrificans that is located in the same genomic neighbourhood as rlo149_c <dig> 

only eight bacterial enzymes annotated as bhmt are present in the uniprot database  <cit> . an enzyme of s. meliloti has been described to mediate this step in glycine betaine degradation  <cit> , but the protein sequence of rlo149_c <dig> shows only weak similarity to this protein. the genomic location, the functional domain and the fact that both roseobacter strains are able to grow with glycine betaine as carbon and nitrogen sources point to rlo149_c <dig> and rd1_ <dig> being involved in the degradation of glycine betaine in roseobacters, representing a new class of bacterial bhmts.

dimethylglycine
even though several genes coding for dimethylglycine dehydrogenases  were identified in the genomes of both roseobacter species, the strains were neither able to utilize dimethylglycine  as carbon nor as nitrogen source. it is possible that the dmgdhs are only mediating the degradation of intracellular dmg derived from the cleavage of glycine betaine.

putrescine
the degradation of the osmolyte putrescine is likely to occur via 4-aminobutyrate, as some of the genes of the pathway are present . however, the enzymes mediating step three and four of the pathway were not predicted in the genome of r. litoralis and also the aminotransferase responsible for the last step of the pathway, i.e. the degradation of 4-aminobutyrate to succinate-semialdehyde, was also not identified. steps three and four might be mediated by rlo149_c <dig>  and rlo149_c <dig> . the last step of the pathway might be carried out by one of the uncharacterized aldehyde aminotransferases encoded in the genome of r. litoralis.

taurine
two different pathways are postulated for the transport and degradation of taurine by microorganisms  <cit> . apparently both pathways with different transport systems are present in r. litoralis. a taurine trap transport system in combination with a taurine dehydrogenase  also occurs in r. denitrificans, d. shibae, rhodobacter sphaeroides and paracoccus denitrificans, whereas a taurine abc transporter and a taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase  are present in most of the other genome sequenced roseobacter clade members. only d. shibae, r. denitrificans and r. litoralis have both uptake and degradation systems. common features of these three organisms are their photosynthetic activity and the association with algal hosts  <cit> . the common feature of all taurine trap transporter-containing organisms is their ability to grow anaerobically  <cit> . the exception is r. litoralis, for which no anaerobic growth was reported yet. nevertheless, the ability to grow anaerobically is indicated by the presence of genes for nitrite reduction  and for dimethyl sulfoxide /tmao reductases . anoxic conditions can occur during the collapse of algal blooms  <cit>  which might also be the situation when high amounts of taurine and other algal osmolytes become available.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that the differences between the two roseobacter species and the larger chromosome of r. litoralis are mainly due to events of horizontal gene transfer. furthermore, the genomes have been subject to numerous genomic rearrangements. plasmid prlo149_ <dig> of r. litoralis, on which the photosynthesis genes are encoded, was most likely translocated from the chromosome as it can almost completely be found on the chromosome of r. denitrificans. the photosynthetic activity of r. litoralis was shown to be growth-phase dependent. whereas almost no reaction to light was observed during exponential growth, the organism was highly responsive to light during stationary growth phase. these results suggest a regulation of the photosynthetic activity according to nutrient availability that might also be reflected in the genetic organization of the photosynthesis genes. a plasmid with partial synteny to prlo149_ <dig> is present in r. denitrificans indicating a common ancestor of the two plasmids. both plasmids and  <dig> other plasmids of roseobacter clade bacteria harbour rfb-genes. the majority of these organisms were isolated from animal or algal hosts suggesting a coherence of plasmid location and host association. new mechanisms for sugar and algal osmolyte degradation were indicated. the ability to store intracellular glycogen as well as the utilization of algal osmolytes was reported for the first time for roseobacter clade bacteria. several pathways could not be fully elucidated, indicating r. litoralis to employ alternative enzymes compared to the known reference organisms.
