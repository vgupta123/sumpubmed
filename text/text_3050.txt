BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi the protozoan responsible for chagas disease belongs to a group of organisms that branched very early in eukaryotic evolution. probably as a consequence of its evolutionary distance from higher eukaryotes, this protozoan shows several unique features. among them, the mitochondrial dna forms a unique network structure known as kinetoplast that is composed of two types of topologically catenated circular dna molecules: maxicircles  and minicircles . the few dozens of maxicircles bear information equivalent to that of the mtdna from higher eukaryotes while the several thousand diverse minicircles carry information for rna editing in the form of guide rna  that direct extensive modification of the maxicircle mrna transcripts  <cit> . the replication of the kdna is a complex process that takes place in a highly organized spatial and temporal pattern. it involves several kdna replication specific proteins that have been mainly characterized in t. brucei, leishmania and crithidia fasciculata  <cit> . several proteins associated with t. cruzi kdna have also been reported . recently, a  <dig> kda protein  of t. brucei  <cit>  was proposed to participate in kdna replication and maintenance. however, a different role was previously assigned for this protein. in fact, this protein  and the leishmania tarentolae orthologue  were proposed as mitochondrial rna binding proteins involved in non-specific modulation of mitochondrial rna stability  <cit> . concomitantly, we reported the isolation of the t. cruzi orthologue  from nuclear enriched fractions  <cit> . we demonstrated that this protein has single stranded dna binding abilities and that it shows a preferential binding to poly  sequences. in addition, the leishmania amazonensis orthologous protein  was later purified from nuclear and s <dig> extracts using single stranded g telomeric oligonucleotide affinity chromatography  <cit> . later it was suggested that the potential lagt <dig> targets may not be restricted to telomere sequences  <cit> .

 dinucleotides are well represented in nuclear dna and also in mini and maxicircles. the minicircle replication origins include the universal minicircle sequence  that is present in varying copy numbers and well conserved among different kinetoplastids  <cit> . the exact sequence of the maxicircle replication origin is not yet known although it has been mapped to the variable region of t. brucei and c. fasciculata  <cit> . two copies of the ums are present in the t. brucei variable region though they are absent in t. cruzi and c. fasciculata  <cit> . interestingly, the t. cruzi maxicircle sequence  <cit>  contains  rich tracts. the promoter sequence of l. donovani rdna, which has also been involved in replication, is unusually rich in  repeats and bears an ums homologue  <cit> . replication origins are regions with the propensity to melt in order to facilitate the landing of the replication machinery while single stranded dna binding proteins assist in the maintenance of the unwound state. in addition, single-stranded conformations mediated or maintained by  tracts in the nuclear dna, and single stranded dna binding proteins specifically recognizing them, could also favor the initiation and/or elongation of transcription. indeed, single stranded dna-protein interaction has been reported to affect the transcription of protein coding genes by rna polymerase i  <cit> . the close association between elements that sustain transcription and replication is well documented  <cit> . therefore potential nuclear/mitochondrial transcriptional/replication roles for tc <dig> are likely.

to further understand the role of tc <dig>  we analyzed its binding specificity, expression levels and subcellular localization along life and cell cycle of t. cruzi. our results indicate that although tc <dig> is able to in vitro bind to several nuclear and mitochondrial  single strand sequences, it is essentially a mitochondrial protein. in addition, subcellular localization during the cell cycle is compatible with a major role for tc <dig> in kdna replication and maintenance.

RESULTS
native tc <dig> is able to bind poly  and other  enriched targets
using emsa we previously identified two specific complexes  arising from the interaction of epimastigote nuclear extracts with a  <dig> oligonucleotide probe  <cit> . later we also showed that the recombinant purified tc38-gst fusion protein was able to bind the same oligonucleotide probe  <cit> . to directly address the participation of the endogenous tc <dig> in the initially reported nuclear extract complexes we performed emsa supershift reactions. we employed a purified polyclonal antiserum raised against the recombinant gst-tc <dig> protein that specifically recognizes a main band with an apparent molecular weight of about  <dig> kda in total protein extracts of epimastigotes . this antibody was able to supershift the complexes formed by the recombinant gst-tc <dig> protein and the poly  probe . as seen in figure  <dig>  complexes tg <dig> and tg <dig> were readily supershifted by this antibody. no supershift could be observed using the complementary oligonucleotide  <dig> as a probe . these data indicate that tc <dig> is present in the native protein complexes formed between the poly  probe and parasite extracts characterized previously  <cit>  and favors its role in the in vivo sequence recognition.

given the proposed roles in telomere and kinetoplast dna recognition of tc <dig> trypanosomatid orthologues, we analyzed whether endogenous tc <dig> could also interact with single stranded  rich cis-acting sequences from nuclear and mitochondrial origins. oligonucleotides containing the sequence of the telomere repeat, a  rich region of the t. cruzi maxicircle that is synthenically located to the replication origin mapped in t. brucei and the minicircle ums were assayed in vitro by emsa with whole t. cruzi epimastigote protein extracts. we observed a pattern of bands similar to that observed for the poly  probe  and these complexes were all supershifted by the anti-tc <dig> antibody. control reactions using the anti-tcpuf <dig> antibody  <cit>  at the same concentration were unable to produce any supershift. these data suggest that native tc <dig> is able to recognize single stranded  enriched sequences in different contexts and support a possible telomeric or kinetoplast-associated role.

tc <dig> is expressed throughout t. cruzi life cycle
in order to better understand the tc <dig> physiological role, we looked at its expression in both proliferative  and non-proliferative  stages of the parasite. the polyclonal antiserum raised against gst-tc <dig> was used to probe membranes with total protein extracts from different stages by western analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  a band of  <dig> kda was observed in all extracts from the various parasite life cycle stages. normalization of tc <dig> levels was performed using tcpuf <dig>  another rna binding protein, which showed minimal variation during t. cruzi life cycle  <cit> .

tc <dig> is found in the t. cruzi mitochondrion
tc <dig> bears a hypothetical n-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and its orthologous genes in t. brucei and l. tarentolae have been proposed to encode mitochondrial proteins  <cit> . tbrbp38/p <dig> has also been shown to co-localize with the kinetoplast in a t. brucei transfectant overexpressing the fusion protein p38-gfp  <cit> . however, other researchers have isolated orthologues from a l. amazonensis nuclear enriched fraction and/or for its affinity for nuclear dna targets  <cit> . these data together with tc <dig> ability to bind kinetoplastid and telomeric sequences could be integrated by proposing a dual localization of this protein, both in the mitochondrion and the nucleus.

in order to address tc <dig> localization we pursued two biochemical approaches. firstly, we performed a stepwise digitonin extraction of intact epimastigote cells. the pattern of tc <dig> extraction was compared with those of cytosolic , mitochondrial , and glycosomal  markers . the tc <dig> extraction curve clearly follows that of cs. it begins to be extracted at a digitonin concentration of  <dig>  mg/ml, and at  <dig> mg/ml 39% of the protein still remained in the pellet. this pattern supports the hypothesis of a predominant mitochondrial localization of tc <dig> in the cell.

secondly, we carried out subcellular fractionation experiments. they also showed that tc <dig> is a mitochondrial protein since the highest specific activity was observed in the large granular fraction . the recovery of cs activity in the nuclear fraction suggests a contamination of this fraction with mitochondrial proteins.

tc <dig> presents a complex pattern of distribution within the mitochondrion
in order to address the subcellular localization of tc <dig> with another approach we performed immunohistochemistry. the analysis of asynchronous epimastigote cultures showed a non-homogeneous tc <dig> pattern . parasites exhibit a widespread dotted distribution in an area that resembles the branched shape of the mitochondrion. in addition,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  cells present a strong tc <dig> staining on the kinetoplast. as commonly seen in epimastigotes, dapi brightly stains the "disk" shaped kinetoplast dna and produces a weak signal in the rounded nuclear dna. although control experiments using nuclear protein antibodies verified the penetration of the antibodies into the nucleus , we were unable to detect any consistent nuclear fluorescence from tc <dig> in these preparations.

tc <dig> intramitochondrial distribution changes during the cell cycle
since tc <dig> was found to predominantly co-localize with the kdna and to recognize single stranded mini and maxicircle replication related sequences, we focused on the intramitochondrial localization during the cell cycle.

for this purpose, we first analyzed asynchronic cultures. we based the identification of each cell cycle stage on morphological markers including both the number of nuclei and kinetoplasts determined by dapi staining together with the number and appearance of flagella assessed by phase contrast microscopy  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the sequential changes in tc <dig> localization during the cell cycle. it shows that g1/s cells usually exhibit a homogeneous signal over the kdna  even though in some cases tc <dig> condenses in two small antipodal sites. cells at g <dig>  exhibit a diffuse signal connecting what now has become two clearly defined spots . the two tc <dig> spot signals do not seem to exactly co-localize with the dapi staining. as the cell cycle progresses the defined spots of tc <dig> disappear and the diffuse dotted signal spreads out, covering a region far beyond the kinetoplast and without an evident association with it . finally in late cytokinesis the signal of tc <dig> tends to regain the homogenous distribution over the kdna .

we also studied tc <dig> localization in cultures synchronized with hydroxyurea . hu inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the resulting depletion of deoxyribonucleotides arrests dna replication in late g1/early s phase  <cit> . previous reports on the effects of hu treatment on the t. cruzi cell cycle phases considered s phase to occur between 3– <dig> h and g <dig> at  <dig> h after hu removal  <cit> . progression of the cell cycle was followed using the same time schedule. we obtained images that are in agreement with the tc <dig> sub-cellular localization determined in asynchrony . at time  <dig> we found that cells generally show a homogeneous signal over the kdna . among them, a small percentage of the cells present two intense signals generally associated with the kinetoplast dna. at 3– <dig> h, cultures largely present two defined spots flanking the kdna disk and the images at  <dig> h also exhibit a signal connecting them. further quantitative analyses are required to determine the significance of each distinct pattern contribution. interestingly, as indicated above, the tc <dig> staining at  <dig> h after hu removal does not co-localize with the dapi staining, being mainly adjacent to the kdna disk. in fact, higher resolution confocal images of cultures indicate that tc <dig> localizes near but not on the kdna . images of either non-synchronized or hu synchronized cells show quite similar patterns in more than  <dig> parasites.

tc <dig> content during the epimastigote cell cycle was also studied by western analysis using protein extracts from hu treatment . even though a constant major band corresponding to tc <dig> molecular weight is observed, additional faint bands are also detected.

tc <dig> presents a dynamic distribution during the parasite life cycle
to further understand the putative role of tc <dig>  we compared the labeling pattern of replicative epimastigotes with proliferative amastigotes and non-proliferative metacyclic trypomastigotes . in the non-replicative metacyclic form, tc <dig> is always found surrounding the kinetoplast. however, in the replicative amastigote, tc <dig> showed a dynamic localization; whereas some amastigotes exhibit a widespread distribution that is not restricted to the kdna , others present a homogenous tc <dig> signal associated with the kdna. taken together these results suggest that tc <dig> changes the internal localization pattern only in the replicative stages of t. cruzi life cycle.

discussion
we had previously reported the isolation of tc <dig> as a novel single stranded dna binding protein without known functional domains  <cit> . it bears a well-defined n-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and the orthologous protein in t. brucei has been proposed to be a mitochondrial rna binding protein  <cit>  and more recently to associate with the kdna  <cit> . here we found that anti-tc <dig> causes a specific supershift of the complexes formed by total protein extracts of t. cruzi and  rich oligonucleotides including  <dig>  the universal minicircle sequence, a repeated maxicircle sequence putatively related to replication, and the telomere repeat.

biochemical data obtained with both digitonin titration and differential centrifugation suggested that tc <dig> preponderantly resides in the mitochondrion. the fact that tc <dig> presents an extraction profile similar to citrate synthase indicates that it is a soluble matrix protein. therefore, the previous isolation of tc <dig> from nuclear enriched fractions in t. cruzi  <cit>  and its orthologous protein in l. amazonensis  <cit> , and the identification of a  <dig> kda putative minicircle dna binding protein in t. cruzi nuclear extracts  <cit> , could be explained by the contamination of the nuclear fraction with fragmented mitochondria. in fact, there seems to be an intimate association between the mitochondrial and the nuclear membrane in the proximity of the kinetoplast in epimastigotes. the extent of mitochondrial contamination could be masking a putative nuclear localization if the protein nuclear abundance is low.

the subcellular localization of tc <dig> shown by immunohistochemistry was consistent with the biochemical data, and further evidenced the association with the kinetoplast, depending on the cell cycle stage. the analysis of tc <dig> distribution in asynchronic cultures and in parasites obtained with the t. cruzi culture synchronization elegantly described by galanti et al.  <cit>  indicates that tc <dig> localization within the mitochondrion is not static. yet, exit from the mitochondria in mitosis cannot be excluded. tc <dig> shows a homogeneous distribution in g <dig>  a discrete antipodal position in s and a more extended location including the antipodes and the kdna between them in g <dig>  the antipodal localization of tc <dig> disappears in late g <dig> turning to a diffuse dotted signal extending beyond the kinetoplast. it is worth mentioning that although many replication protein change their abundance along the cell cycle, some others, such as the universal minicircle sequence binding protein  and dna polymerase β are constitutive  <cit> . studies of the timing of nuclear and mitochondrial dna synthesis and segregation  <cit>  had shown that nuclear s phase correlates with kdna s phase , g <dig> corresponds to the end of replication and the beginning of the segregation of the already replicated kdna, m nuclear phase has already separated kinetoplasts and g <dig> correlates to the early ks. we interpret the tc <dig> homogeneous signal as corresponding to the kinetoplast g <dig> phase. in addition, the dumbbell pattern might correspond to kdna replication itself. when the segregation of the kdna is complete, tc <dig> signals exhibit a dotted and extended location that is maintained during the subsequent replication and segregation of the nuclear dna. approaching the kinetoplast g <dig> phase, tc <dig> reorganizes over the kdna. indeed the proportion of positive cells exhibiting the tc <dig> staining over the kdna could represent cells in nuclear g <dig>  s and early g <dig> phases accounting for approx. 76% of the cell cycle.

the punctate distribution over the mitochondrial matrix in cells approaching mitosis and during cytokinesis could also account for a particular distinctive role of the protein. alternatively it could be a result of inefficient kdna targeting and/or association. interestingly, the presence of dna derived from kdna  in the matrix has been previously reported  <cit> . in addition, a similar pattern has been described for proteins involved in kdna replication and maintenance  <cit> . given the ability of tc <dig> to also bind rna, it would be interesting to investigate whether the foci correspond to rnps engaged in the transport or translation of mitochondrial rnas. to our knowledge there is no report on the rna and rnps redistribution in the mitochondria of trypanosomatids.

the subcellular localization of tc <dig>  its ability to bind mini and maxicircles sequences related to replication, the implication of the t. brucei orthologous protein in the kdna replication, and our results showing a dynamic localization of tc <dig> implicate the protein in cell cycle progression. current models of kdna replication propose that minicircles stretched parallel to the axis of the disk shaped kinetoplast are released from the network and initiate replication at the kinetoplast flagellar zone  <cit> . the progeny then migrate to the antipodal sites where they are reattached to the network. in t. cruzi they attach uniformly to the periphery  in contrast to the antipodal  reattachment observed in t. brucei and c. fasciculata  <cit> . in this context it is possible that tc <dig> is initially recruited at both replication enzymatic complexes at ks phase and later it becomes bound to newly replicated minicircles that are positioned in an annular fashion around the kdna disk. by the end of replication tc <dig> might be located on the two segregating kinetoplasts. this distribution could account for a different non-replicative role of the protein in structural or dynamic processes of the kdna structure. we do not clearly understand the sequence of the transition from the homogeneous g <dig> to the antipodal and more elongated distribution of the protein in s/g <dig> 

given the ability of tc <dig> to bind to  rich repeats contained in maxicircle replication regions, a possible involvement in the replication process cannot be ruled out. it is worth mentioning that overgrown epimastigote cultures show groups of parasites that completely lack the tc <dig> signal on the kdna. this could mean that tc <dig> is not at the kdna in a g0-like stage triggered by environmental conditions. indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility that tc <dig> could be released from the kdna at a physiological g <dig>  later being recruited when the cell enters the s phase.

the constant levels of the  <dig> kda protein detected by western analysis of hu synchronized cultures suggest that it does not undergo major covalent modifications that could explain the tc <dig> dynamics. these data might suggest a passive role of the protein in the movement around the kdna disk, being guided by other proteins that actively participate in the motor process and/or the cycle timing control. otherwise a subtle modification of a minor pool of protein itself would be responsible for changes in its localization. perhaps, the additional bands on the western blot seen in the hu treated parasites could represent covalent modifications of the protein engaged in the replicative process of the kdna.

finally, our immunochemical assays did not detect tc <dig> in the nucleus in different phases of the cell cycle. we still cannot completely rule out a discrete nuclear distribution tightly restricted to a phase not visible after the hydroxyurea synchronization or too short to be significantly represented in the cultures. however, the failure to see a clear nuclear signal in the asynchronic cultures does not support the hypothesis of a dual localization. in addition, the absence of conspicuous covalent modifications of the protein that could account for different subcellular localization or intra-compartmental distribution reinforces this interpretation. unless higher resolution studies should prove the contrary, the data here presented strongly support the hypothesis of an exclusively mitochondrial localization.

CONCLUSIONS
the trypanosoma cruzi nucleic acid binding protein tc <dig> is able to bind single stranded  enriched sequences from nuclear and mithocondrial dna. nevertheless, different approaches established that it predominantly localizes to the unique parasite mitochondrion. although tc <dig> is constitutively expressed, it shows a dynamic localization in the proliferative parasite forms that could implicate the protein in events dependent on the cell cycle. taken together our data strongly suggest that tc <dig> is an exclusively mitochondrial protein which has a role in the kinetoplast biology, perhaps in the replication or segregation processes.
