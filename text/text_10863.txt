BACKGROUND
bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities on the planet, with at least  <dig> bacteriophages in earth’s biosphere . their ability to infect and kill their bacterial hosts makes them key factors in both the evolution of bacteria and the maintenance of ecological balance . in addition, they are able to infect and transfer genetic information to their hosts, in many cases being key factors in the transfer of pathogenic traits such as in pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella sp., corynebacterium diphtheriae and vibrio cholerae. despite their clear importance to global environmental and health concerns, little is known about the complexity and diversity of these living entities, but what is known from metagenomics and phage genome sequencing suggests it is vast.

the most studied bacteriophages are those that infect the gram-positive bacterium mycobacterium smegmatis mc <dig>  with over  <dig>  phages isolated and  <dig> fully sequenced genomes . these phages have been isolated by students from throughout the world as part of the howard hughes medical institute science education alliance phage hunters advancing genomics and evolutionary science  for determining the diversity of phages that can infect a single host. a recent analysis of  <dig> of these indicates they belong to approximately  <dig> “clusters” of related phages  and  <dig> singleton clusters  <cit> . of interest, identical mycobacteriophages have only been isolated independently twice . beyond these mycobacterium phages, the bacterial family with the most phages isolated is the gram-negative enterobacteriaceae family . this group of phages has been isolated and sequenced independently from investigators throughout the world and contains many of the well-characterized, historical phages such as lambda, mu, t <dig> and t <dig>  they have recently been grouped into  <dig> clusters of related phages and  <dig> singleton clusters  <cit> .

a third group of well-studied phages, the bacillus phages, have also been isolated by diverse investigators from throughout the world and infect many strains of the genus bacillus. the bacillus genus is ubiquitous in nature and includes one of the best characterized model organisms, b. subtilis, as well as medically significant human pathogens, the most notorious being b. anthracis  and b. cereus . phages have been isolated that infect b. anthracis, b. cereus, b. megaterium, b. mycoides, b. pseudomycoides, b. subtilis, b. thuringiensis, and b. weihenstephanensis, allowing a unique opportunity to investigate the diversity of phages that infect different hosts within a bacterial genus. this study focuses on the genomic comparison of  <dig> fully sequenced phages that infect the bacillus genus and discusses their place in the diversity and evolution of these important bacteria. in addition, we identify several genes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of bacillus species. this analysis presents a framework for understanding phages that infect bacillus and for comparing bacillus phage diversity with the diversity of phages that infect other genera. in addition, it increases our understanding of the evolution and diversity of phages and their hosts, including the evolution of pathogenic strains.

RESULTS

**phage si0phi is reported as an incomplete genome but is included in this analysis because it was complete enough to clearly assign it to a cluster.



dot plot analysis of the bacillus phages revealed  <dig> clusters of phages with similarity over at least 50% of their genomes  and  <dig> phages that are singletons, having little to no nucleotide similarity to any other bacillus phages. genomic dot plot analysis consists of placing the nucleotide sequences across both the x- and y-axis. a dot is placed where the sequences are identical, resulting in a diagonal line down the center of the plot when a sequence is compared to itself. the phages were aligned on two separate plots due to the wide range in genome size and the fact that no additional nucleotide similarity was seen in a combined plot. figure 1a contains phage genomes of less than 100 kb while 1b contains the larger phage genomes. as stated above, assignment of a phage to a cluster was based on nucleotide similarity over at least 50% of the genome when compared to at least one other phage in the cluster. a phage could be placed into the same cluster by weak similarity over most of the genome, by strong similarity over about half of the genome, or by a combination of relatedness. the ani values were also calculated within each cluster and found to be at least 55% between a phage and another phage within a cluster. from the total of  <dig> clusters over half  are singleton clusters containing a single phage member, suggesting that the isolation of unique bacillus phages is far from complete. our analysis and grouping of phages into clusters agrees completely with a previous grouping of b. cereus group phages by lee et al. in which our phinit1-like j cluster phages would belong to group i, our gamma d’herelle-like e cluster phages to group ii, and our wip1-like a cluster phages to group iii  <cit> . in addition it agrees with the recent grouping of b. pumilus phages into bpa, where bpa corresponds to our a cluster  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
nucleotide and amino acid dot plot analysis of  <dig> fully sequenced
bacillus
phages reveals  <dig> clusters  and  <dig> singletons. nucleotide dot plot of bacillus genomes of less than  or greater than  100 kb organized by similarity reveals  <dig> clusters of related phages. amino acid dot plot of bacillus genomes of less than  or greater than  100 kb organized by similarity reveals  <dig> clusters of related phages. thick lines indicate cluster assignments, which are provided on the y-axis . dot plots were produced using gepard  <cit>  and whole genome amino acid sequences were retrieved from phamerator  <cit> .



in addition to showing strong evolutionary relationships, whole genome nucleotide dot plots also reveal smaller regions of homology  between phages of different clusters that are likely areas of recombination. the largest such region is a ~ <dig>  bp region of similarity between phbc6a <dig>  and gamma d’herelle-like e cluster phages that includes a tail component protein, minor structure protein and holin as well as a site-specific recombinase, a ftsk/spoiiie family protein and five conserved phage proteins.

in addition to whole genome nucleotide analysis, whole proteome dot plot analysis was performed . because nucleotide sequences diverge more rapidly, the amino acid dot plots were expected to reveal more distant evolutionary relationships. the analysis confirmed the basic cluster assignments seen with whole genome nucleotide analysis and revealed distant relationships between the tp21-like d, gamma d’herelle-like e, and iebh-like f cluster phages discussed in more detail below. note that there should be some limited similarity between all of the bacillus tailed phages in that they should all encode a major capsid protein , portal protein and terminase. however, these proteins can diverge to a point that no sequence similarity is apparent.

another common way to group phages is by the percent of the proteome that is conserved between phages. coregenes  <dig>  was used to confirm clusters by ensuring that phages within a cluster share ~40% of their proteome, a cutoff commonly used for determining phage relationships  <cit> . the cluster with the lowest conservation of the proteome  is the staley-like h cluster, with the highly related phages staley and slash sharing only  <dig> % of their proteome with basilisk. all other clusters yielded proteome comparison scores well above the 40% coregenes threshold, thus confirming that the phages belong in the proposed clusters.

the division of phages into the proposed clusters is also supported by the low standard deviation in the average basic phage properties including genome size, gc content, number of orfs and morphotype . for example, the cluster a consists completely of tectiviruses of an average genome size of 14685 ± 302 bp, clusters b and c of podoviruses with short tails , clusters d, e, f, g and h of long noncontractile siphoviruses , and the large contractile myovirus clusters i and j . the average number of trna’s for each cluster is also reported but is highly variable within a cluster, with standard deviations often approaching the number of trnas. this variation may reflect the phages’ adaptation to different hosts because trnas are thought to provide efficient protein production in hosts with alternate codon preferences  <cit> . further host range studies are needed to test these hypotheses.table  <dig>

division of clusters into subclusters reveals large variance between clusters
each cluster was further analyzed by nucleotide dot plot to reveal groups of high similarity, or subclusters . these subclusters were chosen based on natural divisions in phage similarity seen in the dot plot, but could be more strictly defined by ani values of at least 66% between two phages within the subcluster. the subcluster assignments indicate great diversity in the relatedness within each bacillus phage cluster. it is unknown whether this diversity represents evolutionary forces that constrain certain types of phages or if it is an artifact of phage isolation. further phage isolation is necessary for this distinction.figure  <dig>

clusters containing highly related phages
clusters c, d, and f and g are each comprised of a single subcluster containing highly related phages . cluster g is the largest cluster containing only highly related phages, and harbors  <dig> myovirus phages  <cit> , the clusters c and d each contain three phages of the podovirus and siphovirus families, respectively, while f has two siphoviruses. the majority of phages in each of these clusters are recently isolated phages that are not well characterized. in fact, the mcp was not annotated for any cluster c or d phage and we were unable to identify an mcp by tblastn searches, suggesting that the mcp of these phages are novel.

clusters containing more distantly related phages
clusters a, b, e, h, i and j all contain multiple subclusters, with b, e, h and j being the most variable. cluster b contains three subclusters having ani values ranging from 48% to 76% between phages . a coregenes  <dig>  analysis confirms this relationship of cluster b phages, with b <dig> phages sharing 96% of their proteome within the subcluster but approximately 63% and 56% with the b <dig> and b <dig> cluster proteomes, respectively. this family of phages has been previously referred to as the phi  <dig> family, and our subclustering pattern is consistent with the analysis and grouping done by pecenkova and paces  <cit> . similarly, cluster e contains  <dig> phages divided into  <dig> subclusters where ani varies from 42% to  <dig> % between phages but all phages have at least 55% to one another. there is 86% proteome conservation within each subcluster, and between subclusters there is at least 41% proteome conservation. cluster h harbors the very similar staley and slash  and the more distantly related phage basilisk, which shares ~55% ani and 43% of its proteome with staley/slash. cluster i harbors spo <dig> and close relatives camphawk  as well as the more distantly related phages shanette and jl , which share ~53% of their proteomes with the i <dig> phages.

clusters f and j contain more closely related phages. cluster f harbors siphoviruses iebh and  <dig> which share 90% ani and 55% of their proteomes. cluster j is the largest cluster and contains  <dig> myoviruses. of interest, the eight subclusters to which these large phages belong are highly variable in host, trna content and number of orf’s , but they are all highly related having at least 81% ani.

overall, bacillus phages remain highly uncharacterized but clusters b, e and i contain a some of well characterized bacillus phages including the b. subtilis phage phi  <dig>  the b. anthracis typing phages gamma and cherry, and b. subtilis phages spo <dig> and camphawk, respectively.

single gene product analysis mirrors whole genome/proteome analysis
in addition to using whole genome or proteome comparisons to determine phage cluster assignment we recently demonstrated the utility of single gene product analysis using the mycobacteriophage tape measure protein  and major capsid protein  gene products  <cit> . we were unable to use either tmp or mcp for bacillus phage single-gene comparison because podoviruses do not have a tmp and the mcp was not reported or identified by a tblastn search for several of the  <dig> bacillus phages . three genes are thought to be common to all tailed phages, the mcp , portal protein  and large terminase   <cit> . a putative large terminase gene product  was identified in 100% of the bacillus phages and was, therefore, used for single-gene comparison . a dot plot alignment of the terminase gene products  confirmed our basic subcluster/cluster assignment with 100% of phages grouping by their pre-assigned subclusters and 90% by their clusters, while  <dig> of  <dig> singletons remaining singletons. cluster b phage bcea <dig> was the only phage that appeared to have a terminase that was not homologous to the rest of its cluster. this overall percentage  is comparable to the  <dig> % reported for the mycobacteriophages using tmp  <cit> . the terminase dot plot analysis is supported by a neighbor-joining tree in which all of the proteins grouped by cluster/subcluster, with the exception of bcea <dig> and six of the  <dig> singletons which associated with another cluster . the few outliers are consistent with a recent analysis that suggested genes encoding terl have undergone sufficient horizontal transfer between phage groups to disrupt some correlations between terminase sequence type and cluster relationship  <cit> .figure  <dig>

from single-gene comparison, one of the subclusters appears to be unrelated to the rest of the cluster in which it belongs  while six singletons display similarity to other terminases. the sp <dig> terminase is similar to those in cluster i , mg-b <dig> is similar to those in cluster b , spp <dig> and bcja1c terminases are similar to those of clusters d  and f , while bacillus virus  <dig> and phbc6a <dig> display remarkable similarity to terminases of the e cluster . these relationships could indicate more distant/ancient relationships over the entire chromosome or small regions of genetic exchange. the limited similarity of bcea <dig> terl proteins to the rest of the b cluster is consistent with its distant whole genome/proteome relationships . phages sp <dig> and mg-b <dig> also show significant overall similarity to the i  and b clusters , respectively . very weak similarity between b cluster phages and phage mg-b <dig> appears in dot plots and the similarity of mg-b <dig> to the phi  <dig> family was previously reported by redondo et al.  <cit> . coregenes analysis and genome mapping indicates  <dig> mg-b <dig> gene products in common with the entire b cluster , and they are found in the same order , however,  <dig>  bp larger than the rest of cluster b , containing an extra 15– <dig> gene products by coregenes analysis. further phage isolation will most likely deduce its precise relationship.figure  <dig>

weaker relationships are displayed by bcja <dig>  bacillus virus  <dig> and phbc6a <dig>  phage bcja1c shares only 14-22% of its proteome with cluster d and f phages, while bacillus virus  <dig> and phbc6a <dig> share only 10-22% of their proteome with phages in cluster e. in contrast, coregenes analysis suggests only small regions of genetic exchange for ssp <dig> in that it shares only ~5% of its proteome with the cluster d/f phages .

predicting phage replication strategies by terminase conservation
the identification and analysis of bacillus phage terminase proteins presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> can also provide valuable insight into the replication strategy of these highly uncharacterized phages by comparing their terminases to those of well-characterized phages. such comparisons have been used to determine the replication strategy of phages that infect diverse hosts such as enterobacteriaceae and paenibacillus larvae <cit> . in our analysis, several bacillus phages contain terminases that were similar to the well-characterized spo <dig> bacillus phage, suggesting that they replicate and package their dna by a similar concatemer strategy resulting in non-permuted dna with long, direct terminal repeats  <cit> . the cluster i phages had terminases of at least 87% similarity to spo <dig> by blastp, while clusters g and j were weakly similar  and singleton phage sp <dig> was 68% similar. cluster e, phbc6a <dig> and bacillus virus  <dig> terminases have weak homology to the hk <dig> terminase  which packages by 3’ cos ends, while phages of cluster h and singleton bans-tsamsa may have short dtrs due to weak homology to the clostridium phage c terminase   <cit> . the b cluster phages and singleton mg-b <dig> have terminases that are homologues of the phi  <dig> terminase, suggesting they replicate dna with a similar protein-primed replication strategy  <cit> .

identification of two superclusters describing distantly related phages through proteome conservation analysis
in an effort to identify more distantly related phages belonging to “superclusters”, we carefully analyzed faint nucleotide and proteome dot plot lines, coregenes percentages, and whole genome maps for intercluster relationships. the genomic map of a representative phage from each subcluster is given in figure  <dig> as an example, however the larger phages are excluded due to space constraints . since short regions of similarity are common among phages, phages had to have similarity in genome content and order  to be termed a supercluster. table  <dig> lists the two superclusters identified in this analysis.table  <dig> 
bacillus
phage superclusters describe distantly related phages sharing significant proteome conservation


*percent proteome conserved is the percentage conserved between two phages within different clusters as determined by coregenes.



faint lines can be seen in both the nucleotide and proteome dot plots between clusters d, e and f as well as singleton pbc <dig>  in addition, a similar genome content and order can be seen between these phages  where the first section of the chromosome contains phage structure and assembly genes and the last section harbors dna metabolism genes . these clusters also share an appreciable percentage of their proteome, with cluster d, e and f phages sharing ~21% of their proteome with at least two members of another cluster. this observation suggests an ancient relationship that has diverged. singleton pbc <dig> also shares 32% of its proteome with the cluster f phages. these proteins include the portal protein, the mcp, three putative minor capsid proteins, a putative minor structural protein, the tmp, a holin, a glutaredoxin-like protein and nine hypothetical proteins. the environmental success of gamma-like phages is well documented . we have grouped the clusters d, e and f together with singleton pbc <dig> as the gamma d’herelle-like supercluster, named after this well-characterized phage.

clusters i, j and singleton sp <dig> have similar relationships, with i and j cluster phages sharing up to 27% of their proteome. singleton sp <dig> shares ~29% of its proteome with cluster i phages and ~24% with cluster j phages, including several structural proteins , dna replication proteins , a peptidoglycan binding protein, a trna processing protein, several rna polymerase sigma factors, and hypothetical proteins. of interest, phage sp <dig> had previously been described as a spo1-related phage by its discoverers  <cit> . this supercluster comprised of clusters i, j and singleton sp <dig> is termed the spo1-like supercluster after these well characterized phages with family members that can infect many genera  <cit> .

dna metabolism, cell lysis, structural, and host gene products are well conserved in bacillus phages
phamerator  <cit>  was used to determine the most highly conserved gene products within the  <dig> fully sequenced bacillus phages, and the extent of conservation among the phages. phamerator identified a total of  <dig>  phams, or groups of proteins with homology to one another. of these,  <dig>  had a predicted function and  <dig>   were uncharacterized. in addition,  <dig>   were orphams . this analysis confirms the highly diverse and uncharacterized nature of the bacillus phages and underscores the immense biological reservoir that is present. table  <dig>  and table  <dig>  contain the highly conserved phams that have twenty or more members. these phams are partitioned by their function as dna replication/metabolism proteins, virion structure and assembly proteins, cell lysis proteins, or proteins involved in gene expression or host function. it is important to note that there may be other proteins with similar function not included in a pham due to lack of sufficient homology.table  <dig>

dna replication/metabolism
the most highly conserved bacillus gene product is a class i ribonucleotide reductase , with homologs found in  <dig> of the  <dig> phages and four phages have multiple homologs. rnr forms deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides for dna biosynthesis and is commonly found in lytic phages  <cit> . other well-conserved proteins for nucleotide metabolism include a dihydrofolate reductase , thymidylate synthase , deoxynucleotide monophosphate kinase , fumerate reductase , deoxyuridine diphosphatase , rnr beta subunit  and a glutaredoxin-like protein . many putative proteins involved in dna replication and recombination were also identified including a dna helicase , dna exonuclease and endonuclease , dna polymerase , two chromosome segregation proteins , and a mre11-like nuclease, replicative helicase, dna polymerase iii, reca homolog and dna primase . these results underscore the vital nature of efficient nucleotide metabolism in the propagation of lytic phages.

virion structure and assembly proteins
the structural and assembly proteins of the virion are also highly conserved gene products within the bacillus phages, with phams consisting of a mcp, large terminase, portal protein, capsid structural protein, baseplate, tail sheath, and a tail lysin all having homologs in  <dig> of the  <dig> phages . in addition, a procapsid protease, tail adsorption protein, tail lysin, virion structural protein, baseplate and another terminase have homologs in at least  <dig> of the  <dig> phages. these structural proteins are conserved among phages that are known myoviruses and siphoviruses, although the podoviruses and tectiviruses should also contain an mcp, portal protein and terminase. as discussed above, we were able to identify a large terminase for all of the bacillus phages, meaning that these gene products had homologues that were somewhat characterized, but not homologous to the prevalent pham. in contrast, we were unable to identify an mcp for many of the bacillus phages, suggesting that homologs have not been described and emphasizing the need for further characterization of bacillus phages. in support of this finding, recent studies have shown that mcp’s bearing no amino acid sequence similarity can harbor similar folds  hampering identification by sequence alone.

cell lysis
cell lysis proteins are vital to the phage lifecycle, allowing them to exit the cell and infect other hosts. five cell lysis proteins were well conserved including a cell wall hydrolase and murein-transglycosylase , two holins  and a lysozyme-like protein .

host functions/pathogenesis
several gene products that are likely to regulate host functions were also highly conserved in bacillus phages. a protein containing a bacterial sh3-like domain was identified in  <dig> of the  <dig> phages, including phages from cluster c, e, f, and j as well as the singletons phicm <dig> and bans-tsamsa. the function of this protein is unknown but the sh <dig> domain is thought to mediate the assembly of large multiprotein complexes  <cit> . in addition, the camp regulatory protein  is found in  <dig> phages that may be used to control the expression of host carbon metabolism genes, which can contribute to bacterial virulence  <cit> . an ftsk/spoiiie-like cell division protein  was conserved in  <dig> of the phages . this protein may control host transition into the sporulation state, contributing to the environmental fitness of b. anthracis <cit> . as discussed above, pham  <dig> contains  <dig> dut homologues, which are common in many bacteriophages and have been shown to function as g protein-like regulators required for the transfer of staphylococcal virulence factors  <cit> .

there are several other proteins that are less conserved that may contribute to host pathogenesis. five bacillus phages , encode a pho-h like protein that aids in bacterial survival under phosphate starvation  <cit> . genes belonging to the phosphate regulon are reportedly very common in marine phages  while they are less common in non-marine phages   <cit> , in good agreement with our identification of phoh in  <dig> % of the bacillus phages.

subcluster e <dig> phages encode resistance to the soil antibiotic fosfomycin, which may account for the resistance reported for b. anthracis strains  <cit> . in addition, jl and shanette both encode the tellurium resistance proteins tere and terc. tellurium oxyanion  has been used in the treatment of mycobacterial infections and resistance is a feature of many pathogenic bacteria. in fact, resistance is commonly used for the identification and isolation of shiga toxin-producing e. coli <cit> .

the comparison of subcluster and bacterial host reveals evolutionary boundaries
the bacillus hosts in this study can be assembled into two separate groups by relatedness, and this evolutionary boundary may define phage boundaries and predict barriers for pathogenic gene transfer. b. subtilis, b. megaterium and b. pumilus are more closely related to each other than they are to the bacillus cereus group of bacteria, comprised of b. cereus, b. anthracis, b. thuringiensis, b. weihenstephanensis, b. mycoides and b. pseudomycoides <cit> . to determine if there are such boundaries between phages and their hosts, the host from which each phage was isolated was compared within each cluster and subcluster.

the cluster to bacterial host relationship was somewhat ambiguous, with 70% of clusters populated by phages from only closely related bacillus species  and others  harboring phages from more distantly related bacillus species . however, within these latter clusters there is a clear division at the subcluster level in that b. subtilis, b. pumilus, and b. megaterium phages always fall into a separate subcluster than phages that infect b. cereus, b. thuringiensis, b. anthracis, and b. weihenstephanensis. in fact,  <dig> of the  <dig> subclusters  are divided by species, even when the cluster contains closely related species . more phages are clearly needed to understand the host diversity within clusters, however, because only four clusters contain phages from diverse hosts . in addition, this analysis was performed using only the host from which the phage was isolated since the host range of most of these phages is unknown. host range studies will provide greater insight. for example, a recent finding that phage bpc <dig> inhibits both b. cereus and b. subtilis suggests that some phages are able to overcome this apparent host boundary  <cit> .

the subcluster to host analysis also suggests a closer relationship between the b. thuringiensis and b. cereus species when compared to b. anthracis, since there is a subcluster division between b. anthracis phages and those that infect b. thuringiensis or b. cereus . this apparent evolutionary separation is surprising given the recent report of five phages that infect b. anthracis, b. thuringiensis as well as the b. cereus host on which they were isolated .

CONCLUSIONS
phages are intimately linked to the ecology and evolution of their hosts, making characterization vital to understanding the diversity and evolution of the bacillus genus. herein we described the comparison of  <dig> fully sequenced bacillus phages and their grouping into  <dig> clusters,  <dig> singletons and  <dig> subclusters . in addition, two groups of more distantly-related phages were identified and termed “superclusters”, namely the spo1-like and gamma d’herelle-like. this analysis of bacillus phages may aid in understanding newly isolated phages as well as the enormous complexity of tailed phages. it may also serve as a reference for comparisons to phages that infect other genera. other such large-scale analyses are of  <dig> phages that infect mycobacterium and of  <dig> phages that infect the enterobacteriaceae family. hatfull et al. grouped the mycobacteriophages into ~ <dig> “clusters” of related phages  and  <dig> singleton clusters  <cit> , while grose and casjens grouped the enterobacteriaceae phages into  <dig> clusters of related phages and  <dig> singleton clusters  <cit> . in contrast to both of these phage groups, the bacillus singletons outnumber the bacillus clusters, presumably due to the decreased number of total phages isolated . it should also be noted that additional bacillus phage isolation will most likely require future revision of these cluster assignments as phages may be isolated that unite clusters.

our analysis revealed several clusters of highly related phages , and other clusters that contained very diverse phages  . due to the low number of bacillus phages isolated and the apparent expected diversity, it is currently unknown if these differences reflect differences in phage lifestyles, or if they occur due to sampling biases. our analysis also revealed the need for using several analytical techniques to group phages, since one technique may suggest apparent relatedness that is weak by other techniques.

in addition to whole genome analysis, analysis of bacillus phage gene products further underscores the enormity of bacillus phage diversity, with 80% of protein phams  consisting of uncharacterized proteins. because several phams of known function were identified that may contribute to host pathogenicity, understanding these uncharacterized phams is critical to understanding the evolution of pathogenic bacillus strains.

the analysis of bacillus phage evolutionary boundaries suggests that close phage relationships  are restricted by the relatedness of the host, with the phages that infect the bacillus cereus group of phages more similar than those that infect b. subtilis, b. megaterium and p. pumilus. this analysis of host versus cluster is not only beneficial to understanding the evolution of bacillus species but may indicate phage clusters more suitable for targeted phage therapy of pathogenic b. cereus and b. anthracis strains.
