BACKGROUND
more than  <dig> million children are afflicted annually with diarrheal disease associated with the most prevalent infections of the small intestine, including escherichia coli, rotavirus, giardia lamblia, and cryptosporidium parvum, which ultimately results in the death of  <dig>  million children  <cit> . c. parvum is an obligate parasite in the same phylum of apicomplexa as plasmodium and the same order of eucoccidiorida as toxoplasma and eimeria. it is one of the pathogenic agents responsible for cryptosporidiosis, a zoonotic and enteric disease. children in resource-poor settings are particularly at risk, not only with an increased incidence of cryptosporidium spp. infection, but also with increased acute and long-lasting morbidity. psychomotor developmental stunting may occur following infection, especially in children under one year of age, with its effects still measurable many years after infection  <cit> . malnutrition is both a contributing factor and a result of cryptosporidium spp. infection  <cit> . in this environment, malnutrition, immune immaturity, and hiv-infection often synergistically affect the severity of cryptosporidium spp. infection. this situation, added to socioeconomic isolation of most afflicted regions, has led to marginalization of cryptosporidiosis as a neglected disease, one that lacks an effective drug  <cit> . paromomycin and nitazoxanide are considered only partially effective in otherwise healthy patients, while nitazoxanide is ineffective in aids patients  <cit> .

the research efforts to find therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis are scant, relative to resources dedicated to other protozoan diseases, such as malaria. to date, only  <dig> structures from cryptosporidium spp.  have been deposited to the rscb protein databank http://www.rscb.org. in fact, prior to our first work on c. parvum beginning in late  <dig>  only  <dig> cryptosporidium structures had been deposited and released . cryptosporidium structure determination, is arguably a contributing step to the development of effective inhibitors and ultimately drugs. structural genomics efforts have greatly enhanced the diversity and overall number of presently available structures by contributing over 70% of all currently available cryptosporidium structures covering  <dig> different proteins/domains, while the remaining 30% of structures  only covers  <dig> different targets. this focus of research on a few targets, leaving many targets underexplored, plagues drug development today  <cit> . in addition, to the best of our knowledge, there have been only  <dig> studies to date in which a cryptosporidium target and effective inhibitors have been identified and characterized. these include inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase  <cit> , s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase  <cit> , nonspecific polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase   <cit>  and calcium-dependent protein kinase  <dig>   <cit> , where the latter two targets were contributed by structural genomics groups. in order to stimulate interest in new cryptosporidium targets, we have selected for study the c. parvum kinome. as one of the largest protein families in eukaryotic genomes  <cit>  and with many inhibitor libraries commercially available, protein kinases are considered attractive drug targets for human and infectious diseases alike  <cit> . already, plasmodium kinases are the subject of a growing body of research  <cit> , as are the toxoplasma gondii kinases  <cit> . in contrast, cryptosporidium parvum pks  are only incidentally mentioned in publications focusing on plasmodium or other parasites. in an endeavour to address the void, our study spans the classification of the c. parvum kinome and the structural and biochemical characterization of representatives from the cdpk family and a map kinase. comparison of the cppks  with other known parasitic kinases illustrates some of their unique features and demonstrates that there are potential drug targets, as well as opportunities for drug design.

RESULTS
breakdown of the cryptosporidium parvum kinome
assignment of the protein kinases to their subfamilies was accomplished via clustering of the kinase domain by sequence similarity. additional information from domains outside of the catalytic domain and from evolutionary conservation was also used to aid in the analysis, culminating in a classification that rests on a hybrid of results. as such, we found  <dig> protein kinases with intact catalytic triads  <cit> , including those falling into the following categories: agc, camk, ck <dig>  cmgc, tkl, atypical, and opk . like p. falciparum, there are no ste or tyrosine kinases  <cit> , whereas only  <dig> ste kinase was noted in the t. gondii kinome analysis  <cit> . of all the protein kinases found, almost a quarter  have no predicted orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp. the breakdown of the c. parvum kinome is shown in figure  <dig> .

agc group
from the agc group,  <dig> protein kinases were clearly identified, including the  <dig> camp-dependent protein kinases  or pka-like kinases. the cppka kinase cgd3_ <dig> is an orthologue to the p. falciparum and t. gondii pka kinases, pfi1685w and tgme49_ <dig>  respectively. the cppka-like kinases include cgd1_ <dig>  and cgd2_ <dig> . except for cppka and its orthologues, which share ~60% full length sequence identity, these protozoan pka-like orthologues are quite divergent sharing less than 30% identity between them. notably, cppka-like kinase  is significantly shorter at the n-terminus and no gxgxxg motif can be identified . two of these apicomplexan pka-like kinases  have large c-terminal extensions  of unknown function. similar to c. parvum, t. gondii has a proportionally large number of pka kinases which includes  <dig> of the  <dig> members of the agc group  <cit> , while  <dig> pka kinase of the  <dig> members of the p. falciparum agc group was identified  <cit> . cgd7_ <dig> is the only camp-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit annotated in the cryptosporidium database, cryptodb  <cit> , while there are  <dig> in t. gondii  and  <dig> in p. falciparum .

c. parvum contains a single cgmp-dependent protein kinase , namely cgd8_ <dig> . pfpkg is essential in the blood stage and in gametogenesis of p. falciparum infection  <cit> . cppkg is predicted to have  <dig> cyclic nucleotide-binding domains  upstream of the kinase domain, while pfpkg and tgpkg each have  <dig> predicted cnmp-bds.

the orthologue to the t. gondii and p. falciparum phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase   is cgd1_ <dig>  these are ~30% identical in sequence, but cppdpk is smaller  and without the kinase domain insert found in both the pf pdpk and tgpdpk. notably, c. parvum does not have pkb  or pkc . c. parvum is like p. falciparum bearing  <dig> agc protein kinases which is half of that found in t. gondii.

camk group
despite the absence of pkc, the prominence of camk family members indicates that regulation by calcium is clearly important in c. parvum parasites, as well as other apicomplexans  <cit> . calmodulin  with 85% sequence identity to human cam and  <dig> cam-like proteins  including cgd2_ <dig>  cgd2_ <dig>  cgd3_ <dig>  and cgd5_ <dig> were identified. from kinase domain homology, a prototypical camk enzyme may include cgd6_ <dig> which was initially identified as a cpcrk   <cit> . although it is 41% identical to and clusters with pfpk <dig>  in the phylogenetic tree , the auto-inhibitory helix and cam-binding site of this c. parvum kinase could not be readily identified. cgd6_ <dig> clusters on a sister branch to the human camk enzymes and is ~40% identical in sequence to them, but the auto-inhibitory helix and cam-binding motif are not apparent in a sequence analysis. cgd7_ <dig>  contains motifs indicative of both the auto-inhibitory sequence and cam-binding motif. also, according to the phylogenetic tree analysis, it is related to the human camk enzymes.

like in plants and ciliates, the cdpk family dominates the apicomplexan camk group . recently the mechanism of activation of cdpks has been elucidated by our group through structural biology using full length structures of a few apicomplexan cdpk enzymes  <cit> . many of the c. parvum cdpk enzymes have already been identified including: cpcdpk <dig> , cpcdpk <dig> , cpcdpk2a , cpcdpk <dig> , cpcdpk <dig> , cpcdpk <dig> , and cpcdpk <dig>   <cit> . a previously unidentified member of this family  has a kinase domain followed by  <dig> predicted ef hands  and clusters amongst the other cdpk enzymes of c. parvum. notably, the kinase domain of cgd3_ <dig> is >  <dig> residues containing a single large insert after the hrdxxxxn motif of subdomain vib. according to orthomcl  <cit>  this kinase has no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp. also among the cdpk enzymes is cgd5_ <dig> ), clustering with cpcdpk <dig>  but without ef-hands and with small n- and c- terminal extensions of ~ <dig> residues each. clustered with the cdpk <dig> enzymes is cgd2_ <dig>  which also does not have any ef-hands. cgd6_ <dig> is the cpsnf <dig> ) according to its clustering on the camk phylogenetic tree presented herein  and its tgsnf <dig> orthologue . upon comparison to p. falciparum with  <dig> camks  <cit> , there are  <dig> for c. parvum including the  <dig> cdpk enzymes with intact ef-hands, while t. gondii has  <dig> camks listed with complete catalytic triads and  <dig> categorized as cdpks  <cit> .

each "-" within the architecture column represents up to  <dig> residues. abbreviations include: fl for full length, kd for kinase domain, ef for ef-hands, znf for zinc finger, cmb <dig> for carbohydrate-binding module, and pd for pleckstrin homology domain.

ck <dig> group
parasitic ck <dig> enzymes, including those from p. falciparum and t. gondii have attracted attention because of their unexpected binding to an immobilized cyclin-dependent protein kinase  inhibitor   <cit> . two cpck <dig> enzymes have been identified herein, in comparison to  <dig> and  <dig> from p. falciparum and t. gondii, respectively  <cit> . specifically, from t. gondii the cytosolic tgck1α and the membrane bound tgck1β were isolated, while the third tgck <dig>  is uncharacterized. tgck1α could be selectively inhibited by purvalanol b and aminopurvalanol a over the host ck <dig> enzymes; and importantly, inhibition by aminopurvalanol  inhibits parasite cell growth  <cit> . all of these parasitic ck <dig> kinases share high sequence identity in the kinase domain  and should be tested for similar inhibition profiles, including cdk inhibitors. similar to tgck1β which has a c-terminal tail implicated in membrane localization  <cit> , both c. parvum enzymes have c-terminal tails indicating potential membrane localization.

cmgc group
there are  <dig> cmgc kinases in c. parvum which include the cyclin-dependent- , mitogen-activated- , glycogen-synthase- , and cdk-like  kinases, as well as ck <dig> , clk , dyrk -phosphorylation regulated kinase), and srpk   <cit> . in comparison, there are  <dig> cmgc kinases from t. gondii and  <dig> from p. falciparum  <cit> . like those studied from p. falciparum and in other eukaryotic systems, a majority of cmgc kinases are involved in the control of cell proliferation and development, so their relative abundance in these organisms may reflect the variety of successive proliferative and non-proliferative stages which constitute their life cycles. cdk enzymes with the typical pstaire cyclin-binding motif  include cgd3_ <dig>  and cgd5_ <dig>  and tgpk <dig> ). two other cdk enzymes were identified through their orthologues including cgd6_ <dig> with a sktaire motif  and cgd7_ <dig> with a hftvlre motif  and tgme49_ <dig>  camk). note that "composite" kinases  have been previously characterized in apicomplexan parasites  <cit> . as well, there are cgd7_ <dig> and cgd1_ <dig> which have no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp., but are annotated as cdks in cryptodb, presumably due to the presence of patsire and stttlre motifs. with respect to the first of  <dig> of the these cpcdk enzymes with apicomplexan orthologues, the putative cpmrk  enzyme and its orthologue, pfmrk  are the same size  and share 50% sequence identity indicating that classes of compounds effective against pfmrk  should also be tried against cpmrk. these include the purines, quinolinones, oxindoles, and chalcones which have sub-micromolar ic <dig> values against the plasmodium enzyme, but not the human cdk enzymes tested  <cit> . also, pfmrk is inhibited by bromohydrosulfonylacetamides which possess moderate antimalarial activity against drug resistant parasites, but not broad spectrum cdk inhibitors  <cit> . pfmrk and its effector pfmat <dig>  have been demonstrated to be co-localized to the parasite nucleus and that pfmrk phosphorylates two plasmodial dna replication proteins suggesting that pfmrk in the nucleus is involved with the regulation of the dna replication machinery  <cit> . cdk enzyme, cgd6_ <dig> is half the size of its orthologue, pfcrk- <dig>  with  <dig> residues, which has been implicated as crucial in intraerythrocytic development of p. falciparum via regulation of gene expression  <cit> . although pfcrk- <dig> bears an n-terminal domain of between 350- <dig> residues , these enzymes still share 36% sequence identity. cpcdk  and its orthologues are approximately the same size  and share from 65% to 72% sequence identity. crystal structures of c. parvum cdk  have been solved with indirubin 3'-monoxime  and adp  bound by our group, as well as its orthologue structure  structure in the presence  and absence of inhibitors  by others  <cit> .

c. parvum has  <dig> map kinases including cgd2_ <dig> ), cgd2_ <dig>  and tgme49_007820), and cgd3_ <dig> . each of the map- <dig> orthologues is similar in size from  <dig> to  <dig> residues, sharing from 49% to 55% sequence identity. interestingly, like pfmap- <dig>  the c. parvum and t. gondii map- <dig> orthologues share the peculiarity of not possessing the conserved txy activation motif  usually found in enzymes of this family  <cit> . instead, each has a tsh at the same location; and furthermore no vertebrate mapk enzymes deviate in this activation motif suggesting that the fine regulation mechanisms of these apicomplexan map- <dig> orthologues may present a collective opportunity for drug targeting. the remaining two c. parvum map kinases have the expected txy motif, both in the form of tdy, like their respective p. falciparum and t. gondii orthologues. as well, using a reverse genetics approach, pfmap- <dig> gene was shown to be essential for completion of the asexual cycle of p. falciparum, an unexpected result in view of the non-essentiality of the orthologous gene for p. berghei erythrocytic schizogony  <cit> . the pfmap- <dig> and putative cpmap- <dig> orthologues only share 38% identity, but both have substantial c-terminal extensions of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively. the crystal structure of the kinase domain of putative cpmap- <dig>  has been solved by our group and is discussed below. although cdg3_ <dig> and tgmap- <dig> share 42% sequence identity, they are notably distinct in size  where the difference in size can be mostly attributed to the uncharacterized large c-terminal extensions of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively.

both the pfgsk- <dig> and cpgsk- <dig>  bear an unusual n-terminal extension of about  <dig> residues . notably, cpgsk- <dig> has an insert between the catalytic lysine and just upstream of the gatekeeper motif. its structure has been solved  by our group. although the physiological functions of pfgsk- <dig> remain to be elucidated, a series of gsk-3β inhibitors tested on both pfgsk- <dig> and mammalian gsk-3β show a partially divergent sensitivity  <cit> . these results give promise to both pfgsk- <dig> and cpgsk- <dig> with respect to drug discovery.

ten other members of the cmgc group were identified, including cgd8_ <dig> from its orthologue . the putative cpckl and tgckl- <dig> share 41% sequence identity; however, the c. parvum enzyme is significantly larger  with >  <dig> inserts relative to its t. gondii orthologue. in addition, a lammer kinase,  <dig> dyrk kinases, and a sky1p kinase were identified. characterization of the pflammer describes the enzyme as comprised of  <dig> domains, where the n-terminal domain is unique and containing multiple consensus phosphorylation sites, a number of rs/sr dipeptides, a large portion of charged residues, two putative nuclear localization signals, and  <dig> copies of a dkyd repeat and the c-terminal domain is typical of the lammer family  <cit> . by comparison, cplammer  has a smaller n-terminal domain comprised of ~ <dig> residues , has a htd motif , and is unusually rich in asparagine residues. the pflammer is expressed specifically in the sexual stage; and thus the authors concluded that it might be important in the regulation of sexual differentiation  <cit> . c. parvum cmgc kinases belonging to dyrk subfamily include: cgd7_ <dig> bearing an hcd motif  and cgd8_ <dig> bearing a had motif . these apicomplexan dyrk enzymes have low sequence identity between them and variable n-terminal domains ranging in size from almost  <dig> residues to over  <dig> residues. cgd1_ <dig> is annotated as sky1p-like and is implicated in rna metabolism. the arginine of the hrd motif  is not conserved and is replaced by threonine. although it has a small n- and c-terminal tails of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, respectively, it is the  <dig> inserts within the kinase domain that make this enzyme stand out, including one of almost  <dig> residues just upstream of the dfg motif of kinase subdomain vii. ck <dig> enzymes are the only family within the cmgc group that replaces the cmgc-arginine  with a lysine, as is observed herein for the c. parvum enzymes and their orthologues, cgd6_ <dig>  and cgd7_ <dig>  which has no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp. this ck <dig> specific motif may allow for the phosphorylation of substrates with proline or nonproline residues at the p +  <dig> position of the substrate due to its increased side-chain flexibility, giving h-bonding to the main-chain oxygen at the strained position that the cmgc-arginine does, but also accommodating alterative h-bonding  <cit> . the conserved ck <dig> glycine following it may further contribute to the flexibility allowing a greater range of main-chain conformations, although cgd7_ <dig> does not conserve this glycine. the pfck2α has been characterized with protein kinase activity; and gene disruption experiments have shown that it is crucial to the asexual blood stage in plasmodium, thereby providing evidence that it may be a drug target  <cit> . furthermore, it has differential susceptibility to a small molecular inhibitor making it an attractive target for antimalarial intervention, and potentially its orthologues in other parasitic diseases. finally,  <dig> uncharacterized cmgc members with no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp. were also identified: cgd1_ <dig> , cgd7_ <dig> , and cgd2_ <dig> 

atypical group
atypical protein kinases  lack sequence similarity to the eukaryotic protein kinase domain hidden markov model profile and as such are unrelated  by sequence to epks; however, they have been shown experimentally to have protein kinase activity or are clear homologues of apks with demonstrated protein kinase activity. there are four c. parvum kinases that are identified as atypical based on their p. falciparum and t. gondii orthologues, including  <dig> rios  and  <dig> abc1s  . there may be as many as  <dig> from t. gondii  <cit>  and  <dig> from p. falciparum  <cit>  .

tkl group
in c. parvum, there are  <dig> tkl enzymes including cgd8_ <dig>  cgd3_ <dig>  and cgd3_ <dig> with each having p. falciparum and/or t. gondii tkl orthologues, while t. gondii and p. falciparum each contains  <dig> tkl enzymes . recently, work on pftkl- <dig>  has demonstrated that it is essential for asexual parasite proliferation in human erythrocytes  <cit> . furthermore, the authors showed that it undergoes in vitro autophosphorylation and phosphorylates exogenous substrates both of which are dependent on the presence of a sterile α-motif  domain at the n-terminus. although these c. parvum and p. falciparum tkl- <dig> orthologues only share 30% overall sequence identity, they both have a sam domain, as well as putative morn  motifs that are n-terminal to the kinase domain and not shared by the tgtkl- <dig> orthologue. in the case of the p. falciparum orthologue, there is an additional n-terminal domain of >  <dig> residues  upstream of the sam domain, correspondingly this domain is only ~ <dig> residues in the c. parvum enzyme. although cptkl- <dig> and pftkl- <dig>  also bear these sam and morn motifs, the third cptkl does not .

opk group
there are  <dig> clades of protein kinases entirely unique to apicomplexa, namely rhoptry kinases  and fikk kinases . we conducted blast analysis of the sequences of all known toxoplasma rop kinases against the c. parvum genome and did not find a single orthologue. however, amongst a clad of others, a fikk- containing kinase was identified  which has been previously annotated as a r45-like orthologue  by schneider et al. from a tblastn search using the protein kinase domain of pfd1175w  <cit> . this protein is phylogenetically close to the plasmodium fikk cluster and also 40% identical in sequence to pffikk <dig> , with both lacking the pexel motif found in most other p. falciparum fikk kinases. it is also the orthologue of a catalytically incomplete tgfikk kinase . although there are clades of opk enzymes amongst the annotated protein kinases of c. parvum, unique conserved motifs potentially identifying a unique cryptosporidium class of protein kinases are not readily apparent. since cpopk enzymes comprise almost 35% of the kinome, we have divided them into their respective clades to simplify the discussion and are not implying a further organization of the c. parvum kinome at this point. opk clade  <dig> is comprised of  <dig> protein kinases including: cgd2_ <dig>  which is the orthologue of a putatively identified agc-related pfc <dig> c from p. falciparum and the t. gondii aurora kinase tgme49_003010; cgd6_ <dig> which contains n- and c-terminal extensions of ~ <dig> residues and has a p. falciparum orthologue that is also agc-related; cgd6_ <dig> which has no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp.; and cgd3_ <dig>  opk clade  <dig> includes  <dig> enzymes: cgd7_ <dig> which has no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp. and n- and c-terminal extensions of  <dig> and  <dig> residues; cpr <dig> ; cgd7_ <dig> which is an orthologue of pfc0485w  and tgme49_ <dig> ; cgd1_ <dig> which has no known orthologues and a c-terminal extension that is >  <dig> residues; cgd6_4960; and cgd8_ <dig>  opk clade  <dig> contains  <dig> kinases that very little is known about including: cgd4_ <dig> and cgd4_ <dig>  both with no known orthologues outside of cryptosporidium spp; cgd8_ <dig> which may be related to the cmgc kinases based on the annotations of its orthologues; cgd7_ <dig> which may contain an n-terminal transmembrane domain and has green plant/algae orthologues; cgd7_ <dig> which has a tkl orthologue from t. gondii, and cgd2_ <dig> with uncharacterized apicomplexan orthologues. opk clade  <dig> contains cgd1_ <dig>  which is an orthologue to pfl1370w  that also has a c-terminal extension . pfnek- <dig> is able to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate select protein substrates, including pfmap- <dig>  <cit> . there is also cgd1_ <dig> which has a kinase domain with a large insert making it more than twice the size  of a typical kinase domain. it is the orthologue to pff1370w  and tgme49_ <dig> . cgd3_ <dig> has substantial n- and c-terminal extensions  and is the orthologue to pf14_ <dig> . cgd7_ <dig> is an orthologue to nek kinases from p. falciparum and t. gondii. cgd7_ <dig> is annotated as nima related kinase  <dig> and contains an n-terminal domain >  <dig> residues. interestingly, cgd4_ <dig> has an unusually large  kinase domain  that is a function of  <dig> inserts including one after the catalytic lysine , another after the hrdxxxxn motif of subdomain vib, one after the ape motif of subdomain viii, and the last after the conserved aspartic acid of subdomain ix. the remaining  <dig> kinases include cgd7_ <dig> which has a t. gondii wee kinase orthologue, cgd8_ <dig>  and cgd8_ <dig> 

activity of cpcdpk <dig>  cpcdpk <dig>  cpcdpk <dig>  and cpcdpk4
the effect of calcium on the activity of constructs containing the kinase domain  and cad  of cpcdpk <dig>  cpcdpk <dig>  cpcdpk <dig>  and cpcdpk <dig> was tested using the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase  assay and the peptide substrate syntide- <dig> . they exhibited a range of phosphorylation activities , but all showed an increase in activity corresponding to an increase in calcium concentrations with turnover numbers of  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig> ±  <dig> mm-1min- <dig>  respectively, and in the range of values previously determined for other cdpks with the exception of cpcdpk <dig>  <cit> . the difference in the catalytic efficiencies of these four cdpks is on the order of 300-fold for the same common kinase peptide substrate, syntide- <dig>  indeed, the cdpk enzymes are expected to have different substrate specificities. for example pfcdpk <dig> is capable of phosphorylating myelin basic protein , histone  <dig>  and casein, while pfcdpk <dig> only recognizes mbp as a substrate  <cit> .

effect of the n-terminal latch on cdpk activity
the cpcdpk <dig> construct tested herein has a complete n-terminal domain comprising  <dig> additional residues over the other three cdpk enzymes tested, where these constructs expressed do not have this n-terminal domain. the cdpk n-terminal domain has been postulated to function as a structural latch that will enable full kinase activity to be maintained once calcium has been depleted. our data on cpcdpk <dig> in the presence of calcium shows that there is little difference between the activity of a construct with an intact latch versus a construct without a latch, a difference of ~ <dig> residues upstream of the subdomain  <dig> gxgxxg motif . however there is some sequence conservation of hydrophobic residues just upstream of the gxgxxg motif for p. falciparum, t. gondii, and c. parvum; and this may indicate a conserved latch regulatory mechanism for apicomplexan cdpks  <cit> . specifically, hydrophobic patterns including a pgmf motif in at least  <dig> apicomplexan cdpks and a fxrxxfilxxxg , where x is any residue and o is a hydrophobic residue, in  <dig> cdpks which may signify that the application of such a regulatory mechanism reliant on the interaction of hydrophobic residues is used by apicomplexan cdpks .

inhibition of cpcdpk <dig> by pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives
inhibition of cpcdpk <dig> was thoroughly investigated by screening with a series of compounds designed to exploit the small gatekeeper that is naturally occurring in cpcdpk <dig>  but not in the other cpcdpks . for example, similar to previous results  <cit> , pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives are ineffective against kinases with bulky gatekeepers , but cpcdpk <dig> is expected to be sensitive to such inhibitors owing to the presence of a glycine instead of the typical methionine present in the remaining cpcdpks. accordingly, over a dozen pp <dig> derivatives were found that inhibit cpcdpk <dig> with ic50's less than  <dig> nm .

all compounds were tested using  <dig> μm atp and  <dig> μm syntide <dig> as described in methods. a concentration range from  <dig> nm to  <dig> μm for all compounds was used except for cz <dig>  cz <dig> and 1na-pp <dig> , cz <dig>  and jc <dig> .

structural characterization of select cpcdpks
the cdpks have a range of different type of domain organizations, as shown in table  <dig>  to date, c. parvum and t. gondii cdpk structures solved include kd, cad , and intact kd-cad . herein, we present the solved kd structures from cpcdpk <dig>  cpcdpk <dig>  and cpcdpk <dig> .

cpcdpk <dig> and cpcdpk <dig> structures
the structures of cpcdpk <dig>  and cpcdpk <dig>  with both the kd and cad domains intact have been solved by our group. these and other cdpk structures including calcium-free and calcium-bound forms have been used to describe a model for the activation of the cdpk family of enzymes and to characterize the cad domain, a novel member of the ef-hand containing family, whose structure has also been solved for cpcdpk <dig>   <cit> . the exploitation of the cpcdpk <dig> atp-binding site featuring a glycine-gatekeeper has also been described in detail including its corresponding full length kinase structure with inhibitors bound   <cit> . herein, we have solved the kd structure of cpcdpk <dig>  in apo form as well as with a pp1-derivative -1h-pyrazolopyrimidin-4-amine, 3mb-pp1) bound . the overall fold of the kd structures with and without the pp <dig> derivative bound are similar . in both structures, the glycine-rich loop is clamped down reflective of the activated form, the tip of which  is tucked into a pocket created by the crossing of β-sheet  <dig> and the residues just prior to the activation loop. the activation loop, which moves closer to the active site in the 3mb-pp <dig> structure sits lower and retains an additional turn at the top of the α-helix g in the apo structure. the pyrazolo-pyrimidine in the pp <dig> molecule occupies the same space where the adenine in atp is typically found, forming h-bonds with the backbone of glu <dig> and tyr <dig> . n <dig> of the 3mb-pp <dig> is linked by a water to the activating lys <dig>  the large, hydrophobic methylbenzyl group of 3mb-pp <dig> sits deep within the pocket lined by leu <dig>  leu <dig>  ile <dig>  and met <dig>  in most other kinases, this pocket is ablated by the side-chain of a large gatekeeper residue.

cpcdpk <dig> structure
cpcdpk <dig> comprises an n-terminal domain that is predicted to bind a carbohydrate, kd, and the cad. we have solved the crystal structures of cpcdpk <dig> kd with indirubin e <dig> - <dig> -dihydroxybutyl]oxy}amino)-1h,2'h- <dig> '-biindol-2'-one) bound , as well as the apo form . both structures have completely ordered activation loops, with α-helix c of the indirubin-bound structure not completely in the activated form . there is a dramatic difference in glycine-rich loops between the apo and the indirubin-bound structures. in the apo form, the loop is moved up and away from the activation site, adopting a conformation less amenable to binding atp. with the indirubin-bound structure, the backbone atoms from the loop move up to  <dig> Å closer to the active site. once again, the indole moiety is interacting with the backbone hinge residues glu <dig> and cys <dig> . the hydroxyl groups from the "tail" of the indirubin form a series of h-bonds with residues from the c-lobe of the catalytic domain. glu <dig> is pulled up by this interaction, such that the α-helix d is more ordered and contains an additional turn compared to the α-helix d from the apo structure.

cpcdpk <dig> structure
the kd structure of cpcdpk <dig> has been solved in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable atp analogue  . sequence alignment shows that cpcdpk <dig> has a unique insert within the kinase domain that is particularly cysteine-rich in the centre: 101lnvfiddstgkcamdvvktqicpcpecneeaingsihgfres <dig> . this insert is situated between the hinge region and α-helix f. it consists of an anti-parallel β-mesh that interacts with the helical c-lobe of the kd and a helix that interacts with the n-terminal β-lobe . embedded in the helix is a zinc ion coordinated by his <dig>  cys <dig>  cys <dig> and cys <dig> . this zinc finger is not present in any other known protein kd, based on searches by sequence and structure , making the insert particularly interesting and unique.

when cpcdpk <dig> is overlaid with the structure of pkc-ι  that includes the c-terminal residues, we see that the zinc finger lies within the same vicinity as the c-terminal tail of pkc-ι . this tail is believed to bring a hydrophobic residue, phe <dig> into van der waals contact with the adenosine head of atp and the tail forms h-bonds with the glycine-rich loop, thereby ensuring an activated state for pkc-ι  <cit> . the zinc finger of cpcdpk <dig> is in the vicinity of the n-lobe and the exact volume occupied by the pkc-ι c-terminal tail. instead of a phenylalanine, however, an isoleucine  is in position to maintain the more hydrophobic area for the adenosine head group. in addition, for human clk <dig> and clk <dig> , the c-terminal lobe bears an insertion between the two sheets β <dig> and β <dig>  termed the clk-specific βhp-βhp' hairpin, and renders the substrate docking groove inaccessible   <cit> . although the clk-specific hairpin partially overlaps with the β-mesh portion of the cpcdpk <dig> insert, it is distinct in orientation and lacks sequence identity to the cpcdpk <dig> insert . thirdly, although using a deletion mutant to obtain the crystal structure of human srpk <dig> that truncates the n-terminus by  <dig> residues and eliminates a spacer of  <dig> residues , there is some overlap between the location of the remaining spacer and the cpcdpk <dig> insert . there are two small motifs that share sequence identity between the cpcdpk <dig> insert and sprk, specifically 119txixxxp <dig> and 128nexxi <dig> , but only the latter shares spatial and structural similarity, forming the first α-helix in each insert structure but in a nearly orthogonal orientation. for sprk, the two spacer inserts identified in the structure are necessary for maintaining an active conformation  <cit> . although these other inserts have been identified, only further research will determine what particular role both the zinc finger and β-mesh play in the regulation of cpcdpk <dig>  however, the location and other aspects of the β-mesh suggest that it may affect the activation state of this kinase in a specific way. to illustrate, the β-mesh formed downstream of the zinc finger is indeed novel in that its c-terminal side forms part of the α-helix d. this helix consists of less than two turns, and at the head features a histidine  that is in h-bonding distance with the alcohol groups of the ribose ring. this position is typically taken up by a glutamate in catalytically active kinases. additionally, when overlaid with the inactive form of a more prototypical cdpk with the cad domain , we can see that the bottom of this β-mesh would interfere sterically with the inhibitory ch <dig> helix of the cdpk . all in all, this suggests that the zinc-bound form of this particular cdpk could be constitutively active, as a reversion to the inactive state would be blocked. attempts to find structures, either active or inactive of the cpcdpk <dig> with cad domain intact are underway.

cpmap- <dig> structure
the cpmap- <dig> structure  was solved in the absence of any atp mimic or inhibitor, and as such the glycine-rich loop, which interacts with β- and γ-phosphates of the atp, is disordered at the tip in our structure . in comparison with a prototypical mapk, such as erk <dig>  the mapk-specific helix l <dig> is longer in our structure, and forms more hydrophobic interactions with the α-helix c. the activation loop is moved out of position and no phosphorylation states have been found in the electron density. as is typical with structures lacking atp/mimic, a good portion of the activation loop is disordered with residues from  <dig> to  <dig> absent.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, protozoan kinases are appealing drug targets, as many are already known to be involved in essential cell cycle regulation; and there is an enormous availability of inhibitors from the extensive work done on human kinase targets. there are several examples of specific kinases to be considered for further investigation with respect to their potential in c. parvum drug design, as their orthologues in plasmodium and toxoplasma perform critical functions . for example, pfpkg is essential in the blood stage and in gametogenesis of p. falciparum infection  <cit> , as well, tgpkg is the likely target of an anti-toxoplasmosis compound  <cit> . pfmrk and pfpk <dig>  respectively, are inhibited by compounds that also modestly inhibit p. falciparum growth  <cit> . tgck1α is inhibited by aminopurvalanol a which also inhibits parasite cell growth  <cit> . pfcrk is crucial to intraerythrocytic development  <cit> . pfmap- <dig> is essential to the asexual cycle of p. falciparum  <cit> . pfck2α has been shown to be crucial to the asexual blood state in plasmodium  <cit> . finally, pftkl- <dig> is essential for asexual parasite proliferation in human erythrocytes  <cit> . other potential c. parvum kinase targets to consider include those where there is precedence for preferential inhibition of the parasite kinase  over the human orthologue. for example tgck1α is selectively inhibited by purvalanol b and aminopurvalanol a over host ck enzymes  <cit> . as well, a range of compound classes that are cdk inhibitors in p. falciparum are not effective against the human cdk enzymes tested  <cit> . upon analysis of the kinase sequences of p. falciparum, t. gondii, and c. parvum herein, we find other non-kinase features that should prompt new drug targets to be selected for study. several c. parvum kinases include large  inserts and/or n- and c-terminal extensions that can be hundreds residues long, but are not conserved and are generally of unknown function. this includes the 40-residue insert in the kd of cpcdpk <dig> which was structurally identified, herein, as a zinc finger and is suspected to be involved in maintaining its calcium-dependent activity. in addition, there is generally low sequence identity and deviations from the most conserved motifs in the c. parvum protein kinases as compared to its orthologues. all of these factors provide additional parameters that can be explored and potentially exploited for drug design not only for cryptosporidiosis, but also for the other protozoan infections.

the high degree of conservation amongst protein kinases, particularly in the atp-binding site, challenges the general goal of finding selective inhibitors. nevertheless, the adaptation of particular kinases, for example the cdpk enzymes to specific calcium-binding conditions and other regulatory factors, their localization, and their substrate specificity, adds another dimension to the development of inhibitors, thus mitigating the overall kinase drug discovery process. our structural and biochemical studies of cdpk enzymes further illuminate some of these possibilities with respect to drug design. the exploitation of the gatekeeper in the atp-binding site shows that opportunities exist for inhibitor design, as is the case for cpcdpk <dig> which has a glycine-gatekeeper and is inhibited in the nanomolar range by pp1-derivatives. indeed, our crystal structure highlights how one of these inhibitors functions. cpcdpk <dig> structural analysis shows how a flexible cdk inhibitor can bind and gives a starting point for future development of novel cdpk <dig> inhibitors. cpcdpk <dig> has a unique zinc finger and special β-mesh configuration that may indicate that it can become persistently active, providing an additional mechanism of regulation to the camk family that adds another element to the cdpk drug discovery pathway.

for some time it has been known that the cdpk enzymes control crucial functions including transcription, metabolism, ion pumps and channels, and the cytoskeleton  <cit> . with respect to the protozoan cdpk enzymes, many have been now associated with particular functions. for example, with respect to plasmodium, pfcdpk <dig>  first identified in the asexual blood stage  <cit> , is involved in the regulation of the motor complex and possibly essential for p. falciparum viability  <cit> . pfcdpk <dig> is implicated in sexual stage specific events  <cit>  and more specifically  in a signalling pathway that regulates ookinete penetration of the layer covering the midgut epithelium and a possibly an ookinete-limited essential function  <cit> . pbcdpk <dig> is essential for male gametogenesis  <cit> . pfcdpk <dig> plays an essential role during the blood stage of malaria replication via egress from erythrocytes  <cit> . pbcdpk <dig> is critical for the conversion to an invasive p. berghei phenotype  <cit> . in t. gondii, knocking out tgcdpk <dig> by genetic or chemical means indicates that it is an essential regulator of calcium-dependent exocytosis, specifically leading to the inhibition micronemes secretion that results in a block of essential phenotypes including parasite motility, host-cell invasion, and egress. as well, tgcdpk <dig> has been suggested to participate in the motility of t. gondii through the phosphorylation of glideosome complex member  <cit> . these results demonstrate the numerous examples of how crucial cdpk enzymes are in both p. falciparum and t. gondii, and as such suggest that c. parvum cdpk enzymes may also be associated with essential functions and should be among the targets of cryptosporidiosis drug discovery programs.

finally, there are huge untapped kinase sources for drug design, as almost a quarter of the c. parvum kinome has no known orthologue outside of cryptosporidium spp. in addition, the opk group comprises 40% of the c. parum kinome, undoubtedly there are unique features within this group to exploit. with numerous kinase inhibitor libraries available, characterization  and screening of these kinases may result in the identification of novel targets, potentially without human orthologues, thus greatly facilitating the course of drug discovery. this research can be expedited by considering the kinase classification as presented herein, whereby potential targets are considered not only in the context of their family, but also with respect to their orthologues, a strategy that has streamlined many successful structural genomics projects.
