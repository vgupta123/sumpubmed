BACKGROUND
the human myeloid leukemia cell line u <dig> represents a well-characterized in vitro tumor model of differentiation and retrodifferentiation, which can be induced to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage-like pathway after treatment with 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate   <cit> . during this differentiation process, the autonomously proliferating tumor cells become adherent, undergo a complete growth arrest and acquire a variety of morphological and functional changes typical for normal monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . the tpa-differentiated u <dig> cells remain and survive in a transient g0' growth arrest cycle  <cit> . after 2– <dig> weeks in the absence of tpa, however, the differentiated population down-modulates all markers acquired during the previous differentiation process and re-enters the proliferative cell cycle by a retrodifferentiation program, which results in the undifferentiated phenotype  <cit> . recent studies on the mechanism of this retrodifferentiation process revealed the necessity of a tightly regulated protein modulation program, which involves the cellular proteasome  <cit>  and a variety of regulatory compounds, including the nuclear factor polypolymerase  <cit> . however, since fundamental cellular functions are altered and reverted in this differentiation and retrodifferentiation model  <cit> , the precise signaling pathways for the coordination of this phenomenon remain unclear and may thus involve further regulatory compounds of the proteasome, including certain atpases.

the valosin-containing protein , also termed p <dig>  belongs to the aaa superfamily  and represents the mammalian homolog of cdc <dig> in yeast  <cit> . vcp/p <dig> is one of the most abundant proteins in cells and is ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells. thereby, it is involved in multiple cellular effects and performs a large variety of different cellular functions, including transport mechanisms, protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, respectively  <cit> . in this context, previous work has demonstrated that vcp/p <dig> targets numerous ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome for subsequent degradation and may thus act as a general chaperone  <cit> . this concept is also reflected during cell cycle regulation  <cit> , whereby vcp/p <dig> is associated with the degradation of decisive cell cycle regulatory proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. for example, the mammalian cyclin e, which is required for the entry of cells into s phase  <cit> , and the g1-cdk inhibitor far <dig> are both affected in their stability by interference with vcp/p <dig> and subsequent proteasomal degradation  <cit> . however, the precise interaction of vcp/p <dig> and different signal cascades are unknown so far. moreover, the activation process of vcp/p <dig> in distinct subcellular compartments and possible modifications, e.g. by phosphorylation, remains obscure.

vcp/p <dig> has been demonstrated to localize predominantly in the cytosol. however, according to its involvement in membrane fusion, this protein is also associated with various membranes of organelles such as the golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . nuclear localization of vcp/p <dig> was determined by interactions with werner protein, a recq helicase  <cit> , and during spindle disassembly  <cit> . phosphorylation of vcp/p <dig> on tyrosine residues is suggested to play a role in determining the appropriate subcellular localization  <cit> . in addition, after dna damage, vcp/p <dig> is phosphorylated at ser <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the phosphorylation does not affect the vcp/p <dig> atpase activity and therefore, the physiological relevance of these modifications remains unknown  <cit> .

vcp/p <dig> has a variety of clinical implications and thus contributes to the pathogenesis of distinct human diseases. in this context, vcp/p <dig> plays a role in several neurodegenerative disorders, which may be associated with its chaperone-like function as a cell death effector molecule  <cit> . furthermore, vcp/p <dig> is discussed to be involved in certain types of human tumors such as hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas as well as breast cancer  <cit> . in addition, vcp/p <dig> may increase the metastatic potential in tumor entities, possibly by controlling the stability of iκbα, an inhibitor of nfκb  <cit> . up to now the role of vcp/p <dig> during a cancer development is poorly understood. we therefore aim to characterize this atpase in an in vitro cancer model of differentiation and retrodifferentiation to provide additional information for a potential role and function during tumorigenesis.

the predominant focus of the present study was 1) to examine the vcp/p <dig> expression in distinct cell cycle phases of proliferating u <dig> cells; 2) to analyze the regulation of vcp/p <dig> during differentiation-associated g0/g <dig> cell cycle exit and subsequent retrodifferentiation of u <dig> cells; 3) to investigate a possible functional association of vcp/p <dig> with the differentiation process.

RESULTS
previous studies have demonstrated an essential role for vcp/p <dig> in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . in order to investigate the expression of vcp/p <dig> during the cell cycle, centrifugal elutriations of proliferating u <dig> cells were performed to separate cells within distinct phases of the cell cycle . western blot analysis of the elutriated u <dig> cell lysates demonstrated little if any difference in the  <dig> kda protein vcp/p <dig> levels throughout the cell cycle . control of the elutriated cell cycle phases and quantification of the distribution was performed by flow cytometry . a tyrosine phosphorylation of an approximately  <dig> kda protein was present in the g1-enriched populations and remained undetectable in s phase-enriched cells and during g2/m phase . β-actin, which served as a loading control, was similarly expressed throughout the cell cycle .

next, we investigated vcp/p <dig> protein expression during growth arrest and differentiation. treatment of u <dig> cells with  <dig> nm of the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate  for  <dig> h was associated with cell cycle arrest in g0' and subsequent differentiation along the monocytic/macrophage-like pathway  <cit> . long term culture of these growth-arrested and differentiated cells in the absence of tpa for approximately  <dig> weeks was accompanied by a retrodifferentiation process, whereby the differentiated cells down-modulate all previously acquired differentiation markers and re-enter the proliferative cell cycle  <cit> . indeed, tpa-induced differentiation of u <dig> cells demonstrated a significant expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip1/waf1/sdi- <dig>  <cit>  within  <dig> d, which was down-regulated during retrodifferentiation . simultaneously, the differentiation-associated intermediate filament protein vimentin  <cit>  also exhibited marked expression during differentiation in contrast to a very low detection level in u <dig> control and retrodifferentiated cells . expression of vcp/p <dig> was significantly elevated after  <dig> d of tpa exposure and this expression continuously decreased until the cells entered retrodifferentiation to reach the same vcp/p <dig> protein levels observed in untreated control cells . similar findings were observed for tyrosine-phorphorylated proteins at approximately  <dig> kda, demonstrating a marked presence after  <dig> d of tpa incubation and a progressive decline thereafter . western blots were normalized to the β-actin levels by densitometry using the imagej software .

following quantitative rt-pcr analysis of vcp/p <dig>  the measurements were normalized to the uniformly transcribed mrna of the tata-binding protein . in agreement with the western blot data, mrna expression of vcp/p <dig> was significantly enhanced after  <dig> h of tpa induction and thereafter, the transcripts progressively decreased until the level of retrodifferentiated cells was indistinguishable to that observed in u <dig> control cells . together, these data indicated a possible association of vcp/p <dig> with the differentiation process and the transient cell cycle arrest.

phase contrast pictures clearly showed the distinct morphology of the differentiated u <dig> cells. using staining with the dna-intercalating dye hoechst  <dig>  the appropriate compartments of the nuclei within these cells could easily be demonstrated . subcellular localization of vcp/p <dig> during the differentiation process was analyzed by immunofluorescence. undifferentiated and retrodifferentiated u <dig> cells revealed a predominant localization of vcp/p <dig> in both, the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, whereas there was less evidence for vcp/p <dig> localization in the nucleus of these cells . in contrast, the differentiated cell populations demonstrated opposite effects: a localization of vcp/p <dig> in the cytoplasm as well as a membrane association was paralleled by a pronounced immunofluorescence in the nucleus of all differentiated populations . the specificity of the vcp/p <dig> antibody was tested using an appropriate neutralizing peptide . these data suggested that a significantly increased expression and an enhanced nuclear localization of vcp/p <dig> accompany differentiation and cell cycle arrest, which is reverted during the retrodifferentiation program.

in order to validate these findings, distinct subcellular compartments were separated and analyzed by western blotting . predominant expression of gapdh in the cytosol, clathrin in the membrane-associated fraction, and nucleoporin <dig> in the nucleus, respectively, demonstrated a successful enrichment of the appropriate subcellular fractions . western blot analysis revealed a different expression of vcp/p <dig> in distinct cellular compartments during differentiation and retrodifferentiation . whereas little if any differences in the expression of vcp/p <dig> were detectable in the cytosol, vcp/p <dig> protein levels significantly increased in the membrane fraction after tpa induction, most predominantly at day  <dig>  and returned back to control levels during the retrodifferentiation program . moreover, vcp/p <dig> expression in the nucleus was significantly elevated after tpa exposure most predominantly at day  <dig>  and similarly returned to control levels at the time of retrodifferentiation . whereby total amounts of vcp/p <dig> in the subcellular compartments were not quantified, an apparent inconsistency by comparison of these subcellular vcp distributions to the pattern observed in the time course of the total cell lysates  may results from an unequal distribution, suggesting most of the vcp/p <dig> within the cytosol and membrane-associated as compared to the nuclear fraction.

investigations of tyrosine phosphorylations within these subcellular compartments demonstrated a phosphorylation pattern of an approximately  <dig> kda protein in the cytosol and the membranes similar to that observed for vcp/p <dig> in these compartments . in contrast, there was little if any tyrosine phosphorylation detectable at  <dig> kda in the nucleus during differentiation and retrodifferentiation . analysis of the coomassie staining in the cytosol, membrane fraction and the nuclear compartment, respectively, served as an appropriate loading control. the protein levels were normalized to the coomassie staining by densitometric analysis .

these data suggested a distinct subcellular distribution of vcp/p <dig> during the differentiation process and cell cycle arrest associated with tyrosine phosphorylation exclusively in the cytosol and membranes.

for characterization of these findings, we performed an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation of the subcellular fractions in undifferentiated u <dig> and differentiated cells, exemplarily shown  <dig> days after tpa induction . vcp/p <dig> western blot analysis of the phosphotyrosine-precipitated proteins revealed a distinct band in the molecular range of approximately  <dig> kda in the cytosolic as well as in the membrane fractions of both, undifferentiated and differentiated cells. in contrast, little if any vcp/p <dig> was detectable in the nuclear fraction of either u <dig> control or differentiated cells . these data were supported by anti-vcp/p <dig> cross-immunoprecipitations followed by phosphotyrosine western blots with a signal at approximately  <dig> kda in the cytosolic and membraneous fractions of u <dig> and differentiated cells but no detectable phosphorylation in either nuclear fraction . analysis of the protein amount in each fraction was performed by anti-vcp/p <dig> immunoprecitation and subsequent anti-vcp/p <dig> western blot .

to further substantiate these findings, proteins of the cytosolic and nuclear compartments from undifferentiated and tpa-differentiated u <dig> cells were separated by non-linear isoelectric focusing  and subsequent sds-page in the second dimension, respectively, followed by anti-vcp/p <dig> and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, respectively . the cytosolic 2d vcp/p <dig> western blot of u <dig> and tpa-differentiated u <dig> cells demonstrated a distinct spot in the molecular range of  <dig> kda and an isoelectric point of approximately ph  <dig>  respectively . stripping and rehybridization of these 2d blots with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed the same phosphorylated spots at about  <dig> kda, ph  <dig> , among a variety of other phosphorylated proteins . in the nuclear fraction of u <dig> cells, the 2d vcp/p <dig> western blot could not visualize any protein spot and accordingly, no phosphorylation was detectable at about  <dig> kda, ph  <dig>  . in contrast, the nuclear fraction of tpa-differentiated u <dig> cells demonstrated a clear vcp/p <dig> protein spot at approximately  <dig> kda, ph  <dig>  and subsequent anti-phosphotyrosine western blot did not reveal any phosphorylation of this protein spot , which is in line with our previous data. control exposure of the stripped blots and control hybridizations with the secondary antibody alone revealed no detectable signals, respectively .

a possible functional role of vcp/p <dig> in differentiating u <dig> cells was addressed by a sirna approach. the transfection method was tested with a fitc-conjugated control sirna which revealed a transfection efficiency in u <dig> cells of >95% as evaluated by facs analysis . the successful down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> protein in vcp-sirna-transfected cells was demonstrated in appropriate western blots for both, u <dig> control and tpa-differentiating cells . functional changes in vcp-sirna-transfected cells following phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation have been examind by dna microarray analysis . thus, differentiation-associated genes, which are elevated during myelomonocytic maturation, including the cytokine receptor for interleukin- <dig>  were expressed at significantly reduced levels in tpa-treated vcp/p97-sirna-transfected u <dig> cells. according to the cell attachment as a consequence of differentiation along the monocytic/macrophage-like pathway, genes associated with the formation of the cytoskeleton  and certain extracellular matrix related genes such as adam metalloproteinase  <dig> and the extracellular glycoprotein fibronectin showed a decreased expression due to vcp/p <dig> rnai . moreover, previous work has demonstrated that tpa-mediated signals in u <dig> cells are relayed via activation of protein kinase c and downstream kinases to activate appropriate transcription factors for the induction of differentiation-associated genes  <cit> . in this context, pleckstrin homology domain containing proteins, a map kinase interacting protein and phospholipase c were significantly down-modulated in tpa-treated vcp-sirna-transfectants . with respect to genes involved in protein metabolism and particularly in transport functions, sulfotransferase 2a, an atpase , a vesicle transport protein  and a golgi-associated gene  were reduced expressed . in contrast, the kdel receptor was up-regulated, which is responsible for the retention of newly synthesized proteins during the quality control in the er  <cit>  . moreover, metabolic compounds involved in post-translational modifications in the lysosome and microsome such as β-glucoronidase, arylacetamide deacetylase, phosphoserine aminotransferase and xylosysltransferase were increased expressed . tpa-induced differentiation is also associated with growth arrest and down-modulation of cell cycle-regulatory factors  <cit> . in contrast, tpa treatment of vcp-sirna-transfected u <dig> cells revealed an increased expression of the transcriptional regulator etv <dig> and certain histones. . however, sirna-targeting in cells also involves off-target effects, which reflect vcp/p97-sirna-independent modulations and some of these genes are listed in figure  <dig> 

in summary, the sirna-targeted down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> in differentiation-induced u <dig> cells revealed a reduction of differentiation-associated genes and elevated levels of dna-binding and proliferation-related factors.

discussion
although the aaa atpase vcp/p <dig> is involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes, providing a potential therapeutic target, the knowledge about its signaling cascades remain scarce. previous studies suggested an unaltered expression of vcp/p <dig> throughout the cell cycle  <cit> . the results of the present study are in agreement with these findings. moreover, an enhanced vcp/p <dig> phosphorylation of the yeast homolog cdc <dig> was observed during spindle disassembly  <cit> . cdc <dig> mutations revealed the requirement of this atpase for the nuclear division process  <cit> . however, the role of vcp/p97-associated phosphorylation patterns for regulatory processes within the cell cycle remains unknown.

cell cycle arrest in g0/g <dig> by tpa induction was associated with a pronounced vcp/p <dig> accumulation both, in the membranes and in the nucleus, which might be related to enhanced protein turnover according to the functional restructure of u <dig> cells during the concomitant differentiation program. supportive findings from recent work indicated an involvement of vcp/p <dig> in transcriptional regulation  <cit>  as well as in proteasomal degradation during differentiation. this effect was accompanied by a membrane-association of vcp/p <dig> required for retrotranslocation of misfolded and unwanted proteins to the cytosol with subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> . although previous work has suggested that elevated vcp/p <dig> expression is associated with increased metastatic potential and tumor recurrence in a variety of cancers, including hepatocellular, colorectal and osteosarcomal carcinoma  <cit> , the present findings demonstrate an up-regulation of vcp/p <dig> during differentiation and growth arrest. this differentiation process is accompanied by the development of secretory active cells requiring significant endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation  <cit>  and thus vcp/p <dig>  <cit> . previous data revealed that a down-modulation of vcp/p <dig> results in a significant accumulation of ubiquitinated and thus degradation-designated proteins, which eventually promotes apoptosis  <cit> . this is substantiated by microarray studies in hela cells transfected with vcp-sirna, demonstrating a significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding for proteins associated with apoptosis, er stress and oxidative stress, respectively  <cit> . together, the findings may be limited to possible off-target effects due to sequence-independent cellular response to the sirnas used.

the functions of vcp/p <dig> may contribute to the retrodifferentiation process with certain levels of nuclear-associated vcp/p <dig> before retrodifferentiation. indeed, other work has demonstrated a simultaneous parp-1-regulated activation of the nuclear proteasome with maximal proteolytic activity at the time point of retrodifferentiation  <cit> . whereby inhibition of either parp- <dig> or the proteasome blocks the retrodifferentiation program  <cit> , these effects substantiate the importance of an intact proteasomal regulation by factors such as vcp/p <dig> to restore the undifferentiated u <dig> phenotype.

the requirement of vcp/p <dig> within the nucleus may also involve other regulatory functions for the retrodifferentiation program, which concludes the transition of a growth-arrested differentiated population to autonomously proliferating undifferentiated tumor cells. such nuclear function was demonstrated for the interaction of vcp/p <dig> with dna unwinding factor  in nuclei of xenopus egg extracts and suggested a role in dna replication  <cit> . as a contribution to a tumor development, vcp/p <dig> has been demonstrated to directly bind to brca <dig> as one of the key regulatory genes in breast cancer pathogenesis  <cit> . since brca <dig> is involved in dna damage repair, the interaction with the atp transporter vcp/p <dig> altered the transcription-associated dna repair  <cit> . together, these regulatory processes suggest a tightly controlled subcellular distribution of vcp/p <dig> according to the appropriate cellular requirements. however, the signals for vcp/p <dig> to be directed to distinct subcellular compartments remain unclear. in this context, it is interesting to note that tyrosine phosphorylated vcp/p <dig> was exclusively associated with the cytosol and the membrane fraction, indicating a possible role for compartmentalization. this is supported by previous findings which suggested a possible role for subcellular localization of vcp/p <dig> following tyrosine phosphorylation  <cit> . finally, these effects are accompanied by the involvement of vcp/p <dig> in the tpa-mediated monocytic transition, affecting the expression of differentiation-associated and cell cycle-regulatory genes. moreover, genes involved in the er-associated metabolic pathway were expressed at a significantly reduced level, whereas expression of genes implicated in post-translational modifications in the lysosomes and microsomes was considerably increased, indicating a support and substitution of the protein biosynthesis and quality control in the er. this is further substantiated by the enhanced expression of the kdel er protein retention receptor  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the present findings suggest that vcp/p <dig> expression is not altered during proliferation and cell cycle progression. however, significantly increased protein and rna levels appeared during g0/g <dig> cell cycle arrest and an associated differentiation process. a certain redistribution of vcp/p <dig> was observed in the membrane and the nuclear fractions, carrying a tyrosine phosphorylated form predominantly in the cytosolic and the membranous compartments. the altered expression levels of vcp/p <dig> during the tpa-induced differentiation of u <dig> cells as well as the changes of certain differentiation-associated transcripts as a consequence of vcp/p <dig> rnai suggested that this aaa atpase accompanies the differentiation and retrodifferentiation process.
