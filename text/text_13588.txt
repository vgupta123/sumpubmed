BACKGROUND
natural rubber is an important biopolymer that has been produced for more than a century by cultivating the rubber tree . natural rubber obtained by tapping of the rubber trees is used for countless applications, for example for the production of tires, sealings, latex gloves and many, many other items. the main component of rubber latex is the hydrocarbon poly. chemosynthetic rubber is also produced at a scale that is almost comparable to that of the natural compound.

despite the economic importance of rubber and the enormous amounts of rubber waste materials that are permanently released into the environment, complete degradation in nature is rarely detected and wastes continue to accumulate. knowledge of the reasons for this is limited. in fact, application is made of this extremely slow natural degradation for example in the use of rubber tyres to provide attachment sites for creating artificial coral reefs. however, microorganisms that can attack rubber have been detected in many ecosystems in which the physical parameters  are moderate . it is also well known that the initial microbial attack on rubber depends on the ability to produce and secrete rubber-cleaving enzymes into the environment. only two types of rubber-cleaving enzymes are known. one is the rubber oxygenase roxa that was first isolated from xanthomonas sp. 35y  <cit>  and so far has been found only in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . roxa of xanthomonas sp. 35y is a c-type dihaem dioxygenase and cleaves poly into a c <dig> compound with a terminal keto and aldehyde group  as the main product . the other rubber cleaving enzyme is a protein designated as latex clearing protein   <cit> . it shares no significant sequence homology with roxa, with cytochrome c peroxidases or with dihaeme  <dig> -diol synthases  <cit>  and is present in gram-positive rubber degrading bacteria such as streptomyces sp. k <dig>  <cit>  and other actinobacteria. g. polyisoprenivorans vh <dig> and streptomyces sp. k <dig>  two well-studied gram-positive rubber degraders, oxidatively cleave poly to products of different sizes but with the same keto and aldehyde end groups as in roxa-generated odtd . there have been different reports published for the co-factor and metal-contents of the lcps from streptomyces sp. k <dig> and of g. polyisoprenivorans vh <dig>  <cit> , and at present there are currently only two biochemically characterized lcp proteins.

in this study, we used a waste pond at a rubber-processing factory in thailand as a natural enrichment environment for rubber-degrading microorganisms and a source for the isolation of new rubber degrading strains. taxonomic analysis revealed that one isolated strain was a member of the genus rhodococcus, a taxon that had not been previously identified as having the ability to utilise rubber as a sole source of carbon and energy but that is well known for its members to have a high potential for the biodegradation of recalcitrant compounds  <cit> . biochemical and biophysical characterization of the purified recombinant lcp protein of rhodococcus rhodochrous strain rpk <dig> revealed some unexpected properties not previously described for any other rubber-degrading enzyme in addition to properties shared with the two other characterized lcp proteins.

RESULTS
taxonomic identification of isolate rpk1
isolate rpk <dig> had a high rubber-degrading activity compared to other rubber degraders in liquid culture, as revealed by pronounced disintegration of rubber pieces . however, isolate rpk <dig> did not form clearing zones on an opaque polyisoprene latex mineral salts agar while known clear zone formers such as xanthomonas sp. 35y  <cit>  or streptomyces coelicolor strain 1a  <cit>  formed large clearing zones. isolate rpk <dig> developed colonies with an intense red colour upon growth and prolonged incubation on nb agar . microscopic examination revealed non-motile cells. depending on the growth phase the cells were coccoid , rod-shaped  or long rods , partially branched and star-like in exponentially growing cultures . isolate rpk <dig> was catalase positive and gram-positive. it grew well at 43 °c but no colonies developed at 45 °c. strain rpk <dig> tolerated the presence of 3 % nacl . it accumulated storage compounds that were stainable by nile red  and strain rpk <dig> synthesised polyphosphate granules as shown by staining with dapi  and the use of dapi-polyphosphate-specific emission filters in fluorescence microscopy . isolate rpk <dig> utilised complex media  and grew with mineral salts media containing d-mannitol, fructose, acetate, benzoate or octane as a single carbon source. glucose, sucrose, gluconate, pentane, petroleum or pyridine  were not used for growth. polymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate , casein or starch were also not utilised by rpk <dig>  these characteristics, in combination with the red colour of the colonies and the variable morphology of the cells indicated that the isolate rpk <dig> could be a member of the genus rhodococcus. to verify this assumption we determined the dna-sequence of the pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene  and compared the sequences to the database by blast search. the 16s rrna gene was  <dig>  and  <dig>  % identical to rhodococcus mk <dig> and to r. rhodochrous mtcc <dig>  respectively. together with the biochemical and morphological data we concluded that isolate rpk <dig> is a member of the species r. rhodochrous. it differed from the rubber degrading xanthomonas sp. 35y  <cit> , streptomyces sp. k <dig>  <cit> , and other rubber degrading streptomycetes  <cit>  by its inability to produce clearing zones on opaque polyisoprene latex agar plates. previously, bacteria with a strong rubber-degrading activity but with no ability to form clearing zones had been isolated and identified as gordonia polyisoprenivorans or gordonia westfalica  <cit> .fig.  <dig> features of r. rhodochrous rpk <dig>   degradation of rubber pieces by r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> after  <dig> and 30 days of incubation in shaking flasks with mineral salts medium at 30 °c;  formation of red-coloured colonies of r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> during growth on nb agar;  morphology of stationary r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> cells in bright field microscopy, note almost coccoid cells;  r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> cells during growth on nb medium supplemented with acetate . note, star-like branched cells typical for r. rhodochrous;  r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> cells during growth on nb medium supplemented with acetate  r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> cells during growth on nb medium supplemented with acetate . note, presence of cell-pole localized polyphosphate granules in most cells



identification of the gene coding for the latex clearing protein in r. rhodochrous strain rpk1
blast analysis revealed that many actinobacteria and all known rubber-degrading actinobacteria for which the genome sequences have been determined have at least one gene that codes for a so-called latex clearing protein  that is suspected to be responsible for the initial oxidative attack on the polyisoprene carbon backbone . remarkably, non clearing zone formers such as g. polyisoprenivorans also have functional lcp genes  <cit> . this indicates that the lcp protein apparently is not directly responsible for the formation of clearing zones during growth on opaque latex-agar. alignment of the amino acid sequences of the lcp proteins from different species  revealed conserved regions within the lcp amino acid sequences  <cit> . we identified a hypothetical lcp gene in the genomes of r. rhodochrous strain mtcc <dig>  rhodococcus sp. mk <dig> and rhodococcus sp. arg-bn <dig> by screening of the published genome sequences for the presence of lcp-like sequences. the deduced amino acid sequence of these hypothetical lcp proteins included the duf <dig> domain that constitutes the central part of most if not all lcp proteins  <cit> . two oligonucleotides based on the upstream and downstream regions of the lcp genes of these rhodococcus strains were generated  and a pcr reaction was performed with the chromosomal dna of r. rhodochrous strain rpk <dig>  a  <dig>  kbp dna fragment was obtained and its dna sequence was determined . analysis of the dna sequence revealed one large open reading frame of 1227 bp that coded for a peptide of  <dig> amino acids . the deduced amino acid sequence revealed strong similarities to the postulated lcp proteins of r. rhodochrous strains and of several other rhodococcus sp. strains . high degrees of similarities were also detected to many other genome-deduced sequences of putative lcp proteins from bacteria including those from many streptomycetes and other actinobacteria. when we compared the overall amino acid sequence of lcprr with that of the only two other biochemically characterized lcp proteins, a 70 %  identity  and a 57 %  identity  was determined to the lcpvh <dig> from g. polyisoprenivorans  <cit>  and lcpk <dig> protein from streptomyces sp. k <dig>  <cit> , respectively . a  <dig> amino acid long sequence at the n-terminus of lcprr was predicted to code for a signal peptide that enabled the secretion of the protein. the molecular mass of the predicted mature protein amounted to  <dig>  kda .table  <dig> properties of biochemically characterized rubber oxygenases

expression and purification of lcprr
the dna sequence coding for the lcprr signal peptide was replaced by a strep-tag coding sequence and the modified gene was cloned under the control of an l-rhamnose-dependent promoter into p <dig>  and subsequently transformed to e. coli jm <dig>  the lcprr protein was purified from the combined cells of a  <dig>  l e. coli  culture as described in the method section. a yield of approximately  <dig>  mg of purified lcprr protein  was obtained after the final purification step. the lcp proteins of streptomyces sp. k <dig>  and of the rubber oxygenase roxa of xanthomonas sp. strain 35y  were also purified and were used for comparison purposes. all purified proteins were separated by sds-page and checked for purity. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the lcprr, lcpk <dig> and roxaxsp proteins were almost homogenous. both lcprr, and lcpk <dig> proteins migrated at a slightly higher apparent molecular mass  as deduced from the gene sequences . most remarkably, concentrated lcprr had a brownish colour. this was in sharp contrast to the red colour of the concentrated solutions of lcpk <dig> or of roxaxsp and indicated that there were substantial differences of the lcprr protein in comparison to the other rubber-cleaving enzymes.fig.  <dig> sds-page of purified lcpk <dig>  lcprr and roxaxsp. purified proteins were separated by reducing sds-page and subsequently stained with silver. the kda values of marker proteins  are indicated



biochemical properties of lcprr
the purified lcprr protein was tested for its rubber cleaving activity using both the oxygen consumption and the hplc-based rubber cleavage product assay. the oxygen consumption assay  confirmed that lcprr cleaved poly latex in an oxygen-dependent manner; specific activities of  <dig>  u/mg and of  <dig>  u/mg were determined for lcprr at ph  <dig> and at 23 °c and 30 °c, respectively . variable data were determined for the specific activity of lcprr at 37 °c possibly because of the decreasing stability of the lcprr protein at higher temperatures . the hplc  and fuchsin assay  revealed that lcprr produced the same mixture of polyisoprene cleavage products  that had been determined for lcpk <dig>  odtd was only detectable in trace amounts for lcprr or for lcpk <dig> but was the main product of the roxaxsp-derived rubber cleavage products. determination of the activities of purified lcprr at different ph values using the hplc-based product assay revealed a ph optimum of around ph  <dig>  that was about one ph unit higher than the ph optimum that had been previously determined for roxaxsp or for lcpk <dig> and lcp1vh <dig>  <cit> . the stability of all the lcp preparations decreased upon incubation in buffer at 37 °c . in accordance with this, the concentration of rubber degrading products in an in vitro latex cleavage assay with lcprr or lcpk <dig> increased for only 4– <dig> h . roxaxsp, on the other hand, was much more stable and continuously produced odtd molecules for up to 70 h  <cit> .fig.  <dig> assays for oxidative polyisoprene cleavage.  oxygen consumption assay: 4 μg of the indicated enzyme  was added after  <dig>  min  and oxygen saturation was recorded. activities were calculated from the slopes of the graphs during the first minutes. the mixtures were extracted with ethylacetate after 90 min of incubation at 23 °c and the formed cleavage products were analysed by hplc . odtd was the main cleavage product of roxaxsp but was present only in trace amounts in lcprr and lcpk <dig> preparations. the graph for lcprr is given in its inverse orientation. assays with each enzyme were performed at least three times; one typical dataset is shown

lcprr is a b–type cytochrome and revealed remarkable differences to lcpk30
concentrated solutions of lcprr had a brown colour while the lcpk <dig> solutions were red. figure.  <dig> shows a comparison of the uvvis spectra of the purified lcpk <dig> and lcprr proteins in the as isolated  and in the dithionite-reduced state. lcprr  as isolated both showed similar absorption maxima at  <dig>  nm and at  <dig>  nm that are typical for haem-containing proteins in the oxidised form. however, purified lcprr had an additional broad absorption maximum around 645 nm. the absorption band at 645 nm was absent in lcpk <dig> and in other biochemically characterized roxa proteins such as roxaxsp and roxacco  <cit>  and was responsible for the different  colour of lcprr. when the lcp preparations were chemically reduced by the addition of sodium dithionite, the absorption bands at  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm shifted to  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm. a comparison of the reduced spectra of both lcp proteins showed differences in the q-bands . apparently, lcprr is far less pronounced in this region than lcpk <dig>  nevertheless, these data corresponded to the soret and q-bands that are typical for haem-containing proteins and strongly indicated that lcprr is a haem-containing protein. the band around 645 nm, however, was not changed by the addition of dithionite.fig.  <dig> uvvis spectrum of lcprr and lcpk30
as isolated  and after reduction with dithionite . both lcp proteins show a prominent band at  <dig>  that is characteristic for porphyrines. after reduction with dithionite a characteristic shift of the α-band to  <dig>  nm as well as an increase in the q-band region  was observable. assays were repeated at least three times with two separate protein batches. a typical experiment is shown



to confirm that lcprr is a haem-containing protein and to determine its haem type, a metal analysis and a spectral analysis by the haem-bipyridyl assay were performed.  <dig>  μg fe/ml lcprr protein solution  were determined. this corresponded almost perfectly with a stoichiometry of one atom fe per one lcprr molecule. it was of interest that low amounts of copper  were also identified and corresponded to  <dig>  atoms cu per one lcprr molecule. zinc was detected at the detection limit  and nickel was below the detection limit ; other metals  were also not detected in significant amounts. divalent cations such as magnesium or calcium were not present  . the presence of approximately one third of an atom% cu per lcprr molecule was unexpected because only traces of copper had been previously detected in lcpk <dig>  <cit> . the determined amount of copper in lcprr, however, was too high to be explained by an error in the determination of the metal or protein concentration. one possibility could be that the amount of copper was due to a contamination of the protein by traces of copper present in either the growth medium or in the buffer ingredients. for example, the used batch of nacl that was present in some purification buffers was only of 98 % purity and could contain traces of heavy metals. however, sub-stoichiometric amounts of copper  had been also detected in lcp1vh <dig> of g. polyisoprenivorans  <cit> . addition of an equimolar concentration or of a 10-fold molar excess of copper ions  to the assay mixture with purified lcprr had no detectable effect on the uvvis spectrum or on the activity of lcprr. the addition of 50 μm cuso <dig> to the lcprr-expression culture produced no increased activity or yield of lcprr. at present, there is no convincing explanation for the finding of variable sub-stoichiometric amounts of copper in the purified lcp proteins from r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> 

an absorption maximum of 556 nm was determined using the bipyridyl assay for lcprr and for haemoglobin that was used as a b-type cytochrome control protein . this result indicated the presence of a b-type haem in lcprr. in contrast to the covalently linked c-type cytochromes, the haem groups of the b-type cytochromes are not covalently linked to the peptide chain and can be therefore extracted by an acid solvent extraction  <cit> . acid solvent extraction of the purified lcprr yielded a coloured supernatant and a non-coloured precipitate. in contrast, solvent extraction of the c-type cytochromes such as roxaxsp or of other commercially available cytochrome c enzymes yielded a non-coloured supernatant and a red precipitate which is in agreement with the covalent attachment of porphyrin to the polypeptide. maldi-tof analysis of the purified lcprr resulted in the identification of ions with m/z values of  <dig>  which is typical for haem b  <cit> . taken together, all these results indicated that lcprr is a b-type cytochrome similar to lcpk <dig>  <cit>  notably, maldi-tof analysis of lcprr also revealed an ion species with m/z values of  <dig> besides that of  <dig> which could correspond to a verdo-haem  <cit> . as the activity of purified lcprr rapidly and substantially decreased during storage, the haem species with m/z value of  <dig> could represent a haem degradation product of the inactivated lcprr.

lcprr is insensitive to most chelating inhibitors
metal-dependent proteins are often inhibited by chelating compounds. therefore, a variety of known chelator compounds was tested for their effects on the activity of lcprr using the hplc-based activity assay. edta, tiron, or phenanthroline had no significant effect on the activity . ethyl xanthogenate partially inhibited lcprr by ≈ 40 % similar to that for lcpk <dig> but was different from the lcp purified from g. polyisoprenivorans  that completely inhibited lcpvh <dig> at 2 mm xanthogenate  <cit> . the only compound that had a strong effect on the activity of lcprr was the metal chelator diethyl dithiocarbamate . however, diethyl dithiocarbamate had no effect on the uvvis spectrum of lcprr and this excluded a direct effect of the inhibitor at the haem site. carbon monoxide, that completely inactivated roxa and led to a prominent band at 415 nm by uvvis spectroscopy  <cit> , had no effect on the absorption spectrum of lcprr or lcpk30as isolated and this was in agreement with the presence of an oxidised  haem centre. carbon monoxide had no inhibitory effect on the polyisoprene cleavage during the assay for the hplc-based product when sufficient oxygen was also present in the assay mixture. however, when lcprr was incubated in carbon monoxide-saturated and oxygen-free buffer before it was added to an oxygenated polyisoprene latex assay solution, a lag phase of lcprr in its ability to consume oxygen was observed. the oxygen consumption and polyisoprene-cleaving activities were recovered within  <dig> to 50 min of incubation and exposure of the assay solution to air. the same result was obtained when lcpk <dig> was exposed to carbon monoxide. addition of carbon monoxide to the dithionite-reduced lcprr or lcpk <dig> had visible effects on the uvvis spectra as revealed by the increase of the α-band of lcprr and lcpk <dig>  the effect of carbon monoxide on the uvvis spectrum of lcp was reversible by addition of a dioxygen atmosphere and indicated that the binding of carbon monoxide to the chemically reduced haem group in lcp was reversible. this is different to roxaxsp that binds carbon monoxide more strongly and completely inhibits the activity. an apparent consequence of these data is that the haems of the lcp proteins undergo a reversible fe3+ to fe2+ reduction during oxidative polyisoprene-cleavage and that the reduced lcp proteins were the carbon monoxide-sensitive molecular species. this is the first evidence for a switch in the oxidation state of the active haem site of an lcp protein during catalysis.fig.  <dig> inhibition of lcprr by potential inhibitors. activity was determined using the hplc-based detection of polyisoprene cleavage products after 2 h of incubation of polyisoprene latex with lcp at room temperature and subsequent solvent extraction of the products. the final concentration of inhibitors was 1 mm. the 100 % value corresponded to the area of the c <dig>  product peak . sensitivity to carbon monoxide was tested by replacing  <dig>  volumes of  assay buffer by a deoxygenated and co-saturated assay buffer. cleavage products were solvent-extracted after 2 h of incubation time. at least two repetitions with two technical replicates were performed for each inhibitor. error bars indicate the upper and lower values of one experiment



lcprr but not lcpk <dig> is accessible for external ligands
previous studies on rubber oxygenase roxa had revealed that the active haem site in roxa had only one axial amino acid ligand. the other axial ligand was a dioxygen molecule that was stably bound to haem in a fe3+----o2− transition state. the oxygen molecule in roxa could be partially removed by the addition of imidazole thereby moving the negative charge from the oxygen molecule to the iron atom . this charge transfer resulted in a small visible change of the uvvis spectrum as revealed by an increase of the absorption of the q-bands at 549 nm . when imidazole was added to the dithionite-reduced roxa, substantial increases in the soret and q-bands were determined compared to the reduced roxa bands without imidazole  <cit> . this increase in absorption was interpreted as the result of the binding of the imidazole molecule to the  free sixth  coordination site of the haem iron. when we performed an analog experiment with purified lcprr and with purified lcpk <dig> we found remarkable differences between both lcp proteins: addition of imidazole to the dithionite-reduced lcpk <dig> had no effect on the uvvis spectrum and there was no detectable increase of the q-bands. this indicated that the 6th coordination site of the haem apparently was not accessible for imidazole and the lcpk <dig> protein was present in a “closed state”. binding of the substrate  would therefore require a conformational change of the lcpk <dig> structure. in contrast, addition of imidazole to the dithionite-reduced lcprr protein resulted in a substantial increase of the soret- and q-bands  and this can be explained by the binding of imidazole to the reduced haem. similar results were obtained when both the lcp proteins were treated with mercaptoethanol: no change of the uvvis spectrum was determined for lcpk <dig> while prominent changes were detected for the lcprr protein . in conclusion, lcpk <dig> and lcprr seem to rest in a different conformation in their as isolated states. while lcpk30as isolated was in a six-fold coordinated “closed” state, the haem group of lcprr was readily accessible to external ligands and substrates, and this indicated a five-fold coordinated “open” state. further evidence for this can be found in the uvvis spectra of five-fold coordinated myoglobin in the oxidised  and reduced  state. the uvvis spectra of the latter proteins showed similarities to the corresponding spectra of lcprr, particularly in the region of the less pronounced q-bands of reduced lcprr compared to lcpk <dig> as well as in the 645 nm region in the oxidised  state  <cit> . the presence of the 645 nm absorption band in lcprr might be also explained by a charge transfer phenomenon of a charged residue/ion in close neighbourhood to the haem group in lcprr and in its absence in lcpk <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, only the roxa structure  <cit>  but no lcp structure was available to obtain direct support for our assumption.fig.  <dig> uvvis spectrum of lcprr and lcpk <dig> before and after the addition of 1 mm imidazole  in the area of the q-band. no significant change was observable for lcpk <dig> whereas for lcprr a substantial increase at 560 nm was determined upon addition of imidazole. assays were repeated two times with two separate protein batches. a typical experiment is shown



lcp genes are frequently present in the genomes of actinobacteria  <cit>  and many rubber degrading species have been described for members from this group . most of the rubber degrading actinomycetes such as streptomyces sp. k <dig>  <cit> , streptomyces coelicolor 1a, and many others  <cit>  produce clearing zones on opaque polyisoprene latex agar. however several of the most potent rubber degraders do not produce clearing zones and apparently need a close contact to the rubber material they degrade. two well known rubber degrading gordonia species   <cit>  and also the strain from this study  belong to this group of non-clearing zone formers. one might speculate that the lcp proteins of non-clearing zone formers constitute a group that have an open conformation with free access to the active site  and that the other lcp proteins that have an ability to form a clearing zone have a closed form. the prototype of the first group would be lcprr and the prototype of the latter would be lcpk <dig>  it will be necessary to biochemically investigate more lcp proteins and to solve the structure of lcp proteins to find evidence for or against this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study extends the list of biochemically characterized rubber-degrading non-clearing zone formers by latex clearing proteins  to the genus rhodococcus . the detection of rubber-cleaving activity with purified lcprr and the absence of clearing zones during growth on polyisoprene latex agar raises the question of whether the designation “latex clearing protein” has been well-chosen. rubber oxygenase b  would be an appropriate alternative. however, the designation lcp has been used is several previous publications and has also been used for many annotated genes in genome-sequenced actinobacteria. re-classification of lcp as roxb therefore could lead to the confusion of other research workers.

the isolation and characterization of the lcp protein of r. rhodochrous rpk <dig> in this study showed that all the so far studied lcp proteins can differ in some spectroscopic features and/or in spatial arrangements of their metal ions/cofactors and indicate the presence of two or even more subgroups of lcp proteins. it will be necessary to study more lcp proteins to reveal the complete variability of rubber degrading enzymes present in rubber-degrading organisms.
