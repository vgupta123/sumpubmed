BACKGROUND
bacterial yidc, eukaryotic oxa  and alb <dig>  form an evolutionarily conserved protein translocase family, which plays an essential role in protein inserting into inner membranes of bacteria and mitochondria, and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. proteins translocated by them, regardless of nuclear-encoded or organelles-encoded, are mainly respiration- and other energy transduction-involved components  <cit> . because mitochondria and chloroplasts are derived from a proteobacterial and a cyanobacterial endosymbiont, respectively, oxa and alb <dig> are supposed to have originated from prokaryotic yidc and they might have played an important role in establishing a tight relationship between the endosymbionts and the host cell. actually, it has been suggested that, in the course of transforming from a proteobacterial endosymbiont to mitochondria, some of the pre-existing protein translocation apparatus of the endosymbiont appears to have been commandeered, with molecular chaperones such as mhsp <dig> and oxa <dig> derived from the bacterial chaperones dnak and yidc, respectively  <cit> . however, whether oxa and alb <dig> really evolutionarily originated directly from the yidc of the bacterial progenitors of mitochondria and chloroplasts, or inherited vertically from the yidc of the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes, or arose by other means, remains an open question.

in archaea, some proteins distantly related to yidc/oxa/alb <dig> were considered to be members of this family in some previous studies  <cit> . however, because of their low sequence similarities, whether these archaeal sequences really belong to the yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family needs to be further confirmed. in bacteria, one yidc gene copy has been reported in most species studied; only a few taxa, including bacillales and lactobacillales, reportedly possess two yidc genes  <cit> . two oxa versions are found in eukaryotes: oxa <dig>  the first identified oxa, is required for the assembly of the respiratory-chain protein subunits into mitochondria inner membrane  <cit>  whereas oxa <dig>  provides a complementary role to oxa <dig> in the assembly of cytochrome oxidase. the two oxa were considered to have evolved from a duplication of their ancestral gene during the early evolution of mitochondria  <cit> . because this evolutionary scenario was deduced only from the studies on higher eukaryotes, further investigations are necessary to include lower eukaryotes such as protists, which represent the early stage of eukaryote evolution. as for chloroplastic alb <dig>  a few plastid-containing eukaryotes have been investigated thus far. two members of alb <dig> were identified in chlamydomonas reinhardtii and arabidopsis thaliana; one is proved to be essential for the efficient assembly of subunits of photosynthetic complexes  <cit>  and the other has a special function in proper chloroplast biogenesis besides more or less involvement in assembling photosynthetic complexes  <cit> . nevertheless, whether all plastid-containing eukaryotes possess the two alb <dig> members is still unclear and their evolutionary history is unknown yet.

earlier phylogenetic analysis of oxa <dig> family performed by yen et al  <cit>  included only a very limited number of sequences and taxonomic samples. until now, no studies on the evolution of the entire yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family in all the three domains of life are reported.

to address the above issues, we conducted comprehensive searches against all available public databases for yidc/oxa/alb <dig> homologs. we further investigated the phylogenetic distribution of the family in the three domains of life and performed phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining approaches. an evolutionary route chart of the entire yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family is proposed mainly based on the results of our study.

RESULTS
phylogenetic distribution of yidc/oxa/alb <dig> in the three domains of life
of the  <dig> archaeal species investigated, no yidc homologs were found in all the  <dig> crenarchaeota and one nanoarchaeota. yidc homologs were only found in seven of the  <dig> euryarchaeota, each containing a single copy  with low sequence similarity to those from bacteria. nevertheless, though their sequences are usually short , our prediction with tmpred showed these euryarchaeota yidc homologs all possess four transmembrane regions . among these homologs, only two  had been reported previously  <cit> .

we have investigated  <dig> bacterial species which cover almost all the lineages . as previous work  <cit>  showed, one yidc homolog was identified in most species and two in many bacillus and lactobacillales. for the first time, we found that many actinobacteria and one clostridium also have two yidc genes. interestingly, all the bacteria with two yidc homologous genes are generally gram-positive bacteria, but not every gram-positive bacterium possesses two yidc genes. these bacterial yidc have various sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> aa, but our prediction with tmpred showed that they all possess several  transmembrane regions .

in eukaryotes, two oxa  homologs can be found in fungi and metazoa, which is consistent with the previous investigation of fewer species  <cit> . however, we found much more distributional diversity in other lineages. firstly, the number of oxa homologs varies among protists: two copies are found in monosiga brevicollis, trypanosoma and leishmania, with the exception that t. cruzi contain three copies. only one copy was found in plasmodia and none in amitochondriate protozoa  <cit> , including giardia lamblia, trichomonas vaginalis , cryptosporidium hominis, c. parvum, encephalitozoon cuniculi, and entamoeba histolytica; secondly, green algae, red algae, diatoms, oomycetes and plants generally have two oxa homologs, but surprisingly c. reinhardtii has none at all. it is noteworthy that one oxa in green algae and plants is longer than the other . our further analysis indicated that besides the conserved  <dig> kd imp domain, the longer one has an additional c-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat  domain that can be predicated by cdart. in oryza sativa, for example, the tpr domain was predicted to be located between residues 361p and  <dig> v in the longer oxa. the longer oxa is definitely predicted to be a mitochondria-located protein by mitoprot ii .

two alb <dig> homologs were also identified in many other plants, green algae, and, for the first time in diatoms, in addition to c. reinhardtii and a. thaliana which had been previously studied  <cit> . only one alb <dig> homolog could be found in the red alga cyanidioschyron merolae and, interestingly, four in plant populus trichocarp. no alb <dig> homolog could be detected in the completely sequenced genome of plasmodium falciparum and in several partially sequenced genomes of oomycetes , though the two lineages were considered to possess typical plastids once  <cit> .

phylogeny of yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family
 evolutionary correlation between prokaryotic yidc and eukaryotic oxa/alb3
homologous sequences from representative species of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes were used to perform phylogenetic analysis. it was showed that mitochondrial oxa, chloroplastic alb <dig>  and archaeal yidc form three separate clades, respectively, while bacterial yidc alone form several other clades that are largely consistent with their source organism lineages . the mitochondrial oxa clade does not group with proteobacterial yidc clade; the alb <dig> clade is nested within the large bacterial yidc clades without obviously showing a close relationship with the cyanobacterial yidc clade.

the au test significantly rejects  that proteobacteria yidc is a sister of oxa . the topologies placing cyanobacteria yidc as sister of alb <dig> have low p values  in the tests. although a possible close relationship between alb <dig> and cyanobacterial yidc cannot be significantly rejected, the topology shown in figure  <dig> is supported to be the most likely evolutionary scenario  by the au test, suggesting that alb <dig> is unlikely of cyanobacterial origin.

to test whether the high divergence of archaeal yidc leads to the low support values of our figure  <dig>  further phylogenetic analyses  were conducted only including representative bacterial and eukaryotic sequences. these additional analyses generated a similar topology without any obvious increase in support values.

 phylogeny of oxa and alb <dig> subfamilies in eukaryotes
to investigate the evolutionary history of oxa and alb <dig> in eukaryotes, phylogenetic analyses were performed based on most of the oxa and alb <dig> protein sequences from diverse eukaryotes. the ml and nj methods gave essentially the same tree topology except for some minor details. oxa sequences from all eukaryotes form two separate groups  and they are denoted oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> respectively as suggested before  <cit> . these data suggest that the oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> genes are derived from a single gene duplication that occurred at least as ancient as before the divergence of algae, fungi and metazoa.

it is notable that oxa <dig> from algae and plants have undergone accelerated evolution which is reflected by their relatively long branches in the phylogenetic tree . among them, the oxa <dig> sequences from green algae and plants all  possess an additional tpr domain as mentioned above, which might partially contribute to their long branches. such accelerated evolution can also be seen from the matrix of amino acid sequence identities among these sequences , which shows that the percent identities among oxa <dig> sequences are always lower than those among oxa <dig> homologs in green algae and plants.

trypanosoma and leishmania homologous genes are usually highly divergent from those of other eukaryotes  <cit> . this is also true to oxa. because such divergence can affect the phylogenetic tree seriously, especially when combined with the fast evolved alga and plant oxa <dig> genes, they were excluded from the phylogenetic analyses above. to determine their phylogenetic affinity, further analyses were performed with a smaller data set that included samples from fungal and animal oxa, yidc and alb <dig>  it was showed that all t. cruzi, t. brucei and l. major oxa homologs cluster together and form two groups, each including one homolog of the two of each species. both these groups cluster together with the oxa <dig> clade, indicating a recent oxa <dig> duplication and the loss of oxa <dig> in these kinetoplastid. we here named the two kinetoplastid oxa groups as oxai and oxaii instead of oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> .

alb <dig> homologs from green algae and plants cluster together in our phylogenetic trees . within this large clade, green alga alb <dig> form two distinct but adjacent branches, which are designated as alb <dig>  and alb <dig>  respectively  <cit> , and each branch includes one of the two alb <dig> copies. plant alb <dig> also split into two distinct and adjacent groups that are in turn sister to green alga alb <dig> . we named the two plant alb <dig> groups alb <dig> a and alb <dig> b, respectively. each of the two groups comprise of one alb <dig> from a. thaliana, oryza sativa, and two from populus trichocarp . although bootstrap values are sometimes not particularly strong, additional au tests significantly rejected the scenario that alga alb <dig>  and alb <dig>  are sister groups , suggesting that the alb <dig> gene duplication event happened in the common ancestor of plant and green algae rather than in green algae lineage specifically, and that the secondary loss of one alb <dig> gene occurred in the process of evolutionary origin of plant from green algae. however, it is hard for us to determine which alb <dig> gene  had been lost in the process as the alternative tree placing alga alb <dig>  as a sister group to plant alb <dig> was not be rejected significantly  in our au test.

outside the green alga-plant alb <dig> clade, the only one alb <dig> of red alga  forms a separate branch, and the two alb <dig>  of diatoms  form two other separate branches .

discussion
yidc in archaea and bacteria
although nine yidc homologs were reported in archaea by earlier studies  <cit> , only a limited taxonomic sample was covered and the distribution of yidc in the entire archaea domain was largely unclear. here we have investigated all the available  <dig> species in all the three archaea lineages, crenarchaeota, euryarchaeota, and nanoarchaeota, but only identified seven yidc homologs, including two old ones . all the seven homologs were identified in euryarchaeota. they all contain the conserved homologous transmembrane domain though not the typical  <dig> kd-imp  domain. these results suggest that yidc might have arisen in the euryarchaeota lineage. however, whether these identified homologs in euryarchaeota maintain the same function as their bacterial homologs and whether these functions are substituted by other translocases in other archaea remain interesting issues for further studies.

our survey covers much more bacterial species and lineages  than earlier studies. the results confirmed that yidc is ubiquitous in bacteria, with most bacteria possessing one yidc copy and some bacillus and lactobacillales possessing two copies. in addition, we found that some actinobacteria and one clostridium also have two yidc copies, and that all the bacteria bearing two yidc copies are gram-positive bacteria. these results indicate yidc is a common protein translocation system in bacteria. it remains to be further investigated why so many gram-positive bacteria bear two yidc.

the diversity and evolution of oxa in eukaryotes
our investigation showed a rich diversity of oxa in eukaryotes, reflecting the specific divergences of the translocases in different lineages.

our survey showed that besides plants, fungi and metazoans, which were studied previously  <cit> , protists  also possess two oxa versions . this suggests that a very early oxa duplication must have occurred at least prior to the divergence of protists, fungi, plants and metazoans, that is, in the common ancestor of theses lineages. thus, our results provide stronger evidence than the previous work, which was only carried out on higher eukaryotes  <cit> , for the supposition that the duplication occurred during the early evolution of mitochondria  <cit> . the formation of oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> may be one of the prerequisites for transforming a bacterial endosymbiont into a mitochondrion during the evolution of eukaryotic cells.

gene duplication often leads to functional differentiation between homologs. it has been suggested that, by acquiring a ribosome-binding coiled-coil structure in the c-terminal to facilitate the interaction with mitochondrial ribosome, oxa <dig> carries out co-translational transport of neo-peptides while oxa <dig> carries out a post-translational transport in the biogenesis of cytochrome oxidase  <cit> . however, our data indicate that such a c-terminal coiled-coil structure is only restricted to a few oxa <dig> sequences . in addition, only one substrate of oxa <dig> has been found so far, and little is known about the function of oxa <dig>  therefore, the above "co- and post-translational transport" hypothesis is doubtful, and actually the functional divergence and collaboration between oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> is unclear yet. nevertheless, this issue might be intimately related to the early establishment of proteobacterial endosymbionts or mitochondria during the origin and evolution of eukaryotic cells.

after the early duplication in the common ancestor of eukaryotes, oxa diverged in different eukaryotic lineages, especially in protists, resulting in rich diversity or adaptive differentiation.

1) oxa genes in c. reinhardtii were completely lost. the reason for such a specific loss is unknown. there may be another system to substitute the oxa system in this organism.

2) in trypanosoma and leishmania, oxa sequences form two other groups  that are sister to oxa <dig>  rather than being included in oxa <dig> and oxa <dig> groups of the other organisms. this might reflect an independent duplication occurred in the common ancestor of trypanosoma and leishmania. the most likely scenario for the evolution of oxai and oxaii includes a loss of oxa <dig> and a lineage-specific duplication of oxa <dig>  these kinetoplastids possess a peculiar mitochondrion called kinetoplastid, which is unique in many respects  <cit> . therefore, such a condition of oxa might relate to the peculiar mitochondria in these organisms. it will be interesting to study why oxai in t. cruzi duplicated again and produced twocopies.

3) oxa in amitochondriate protozoa is completely absent. our investigation also indicated that the genes of oxa substrates  and oxa-associated proteins  are also absent in these organisms . these amitochondriate protozoa lack canonical mitochondrion but have mitosome or hydrogensome, which contain no respiratory complex and genome  <cit> . therefore, the oxa translocation system may have lost completely in these organisms.

4) green algae and plants have two oxa, but their oxa <dig> sequences are obviously longer because of an additional c-terminal tpr domain. since this domain is not present in oxa of any other lineages, the acquisition of the tpr domain in oxa <dig> of these organisms must have occurred after the split of green algae from other eukaryotic lineages. tpr domain has been shown in various organisms to mediate protein-protein interactions and assembly of multiprotein complexes  <cit> . proteins containing tprs are involved in a variety of biological processes, one of which is protein transport  <cit> . it was reported that many mitochondrial out membrane translocases including tom <dig>  tom <dig> and tom <dig> possess tpr domain,  <cit> . no inner membrane translocase was ever found to have this domain so far. therefore, this is the first report that tpr domain occurs in a mitochondrial inner membrane translocase. similar differences in mitochondrial translocases between plant and yeast were considered to be involved in avoiding mitochondria mistakenly importing chloroplast proteins in plants  <cit> . therefore, the additional tpr domain of oxa <dig> in green algae and plants might also to be involved in keeping away similar mistaken import of chloroplast proteins. but the inner-membrane location of oxa in mitochondria and the absence of tpr domain in oxa of red alga and diatoms weaken this hypothesis.

alb <dig> in plastid-containing organisms and its evolution
except for c. merolae, our survey indicated that almost all plastid-containing eukaryotes investigated possess at least two alb <dig> copies. our phylogenetic analyses indicated that alb <dig> gene duplication and loss occurred several times during the evolution of plastid-containing eukaryotes. the first duplication event might occurred at least in the last common ancestor of green algae and produced alb <dig>  and alb <dig> ; then, during the emergence of land plant from green algae, one alb <dig> gene copy was lost and the other was subject to a second duplication event and led to the two genes  found in present plants; interestingly, the two plant alb <dig> genes both duplicated recently once again in p. trichocarp and produced four alb <dig> genes. additionally, another duplication of alb <dig> occurred in the ancestor of diatoms and resulted in two alb <dig>  in extant diatoms. the red alga c. merolae possesses only one alb <dig> copy, and this may be related to its smallest genome among all photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> . an alb <dig> gene copy might have been lost in cyanidioschyzon in the process of its genome reduction.

oomycetes are often considered to have secondarily lost their plastids and become nonphotosynthetic  <cit> . no alb <dig> could be identified in oomycetes, suggesting a loss of the alb <dig> system likely as a result of loss of plastids. plasmodia possess degenerated plastids, but no alb <dig> gene and its substrate  genes could be detected . this suggests that alb <dig> pathway exists no longer in the degenerated plastids.

the universal distribution of two alb <dig> in plastid-containing organisms may imply distinct functions for the two alb <dig> copies. according to woolhead et al  <cit>  and gohre et al  <cit> , alb <dig> /a is responsible for the assembly of photosystem units into thylakoid membrane, whereas alb <dig> /b is in charge of the formation of proper chloroplast ultrastructure and also partially involved in photosynthesis. photosynthesis and chloroplast biogenesis are two important activities for photosynthetic eukaryotes. the availability of two alb <dig> gene copies will render the regulation of the two separate activities more effectively. anyway, to determine the functional differentiation between alb <dig>  and alb <dig> , alb <dig> a and alb <dig> b would gather more attention in the future.

the origin of eukaryotic oxa and alb3: not directly from the yidc of the bacterial endosymbiotic ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts
yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family was customarily considered as a good example to exhibit the conservation of protein transporting system in prokaryotes and eukaryotic endosymbionts  <cit> . according to the endosymbiosis theory, it seems reasonable to suppose that oxa and alb <dig> are derived directly from the yidc of the bacterial progenitors of mitochondrion and chloroplast, respectively  <cit>  consequently, like many mitochondrial or chloroplastic proteins  <cit> , oxa and alb <dig> are expected to group with yidc sequences from proteobacteria and cyanobacteria respectively. however, our phylogenetic analyses indicated that, although oxa and alb <dig> do have two separate origins, they are not particularly related to proteobacterial and cyanobacterial yidc sequences, respectively. instead, oxa sequences appear to form a separate clade; alb <dig> sequences group with yidc clades of various bacterial lineages with generally poor bootstrap support and their specific affiliation cannot be decisively pinpointed from our data. therefore, our studies have denied the supposition that oxa and alb <dig> originated directly from yidc of the bacterial progenitors of the two organelles. what prokaryotic yidc once gave rise to the eukaryotic oxa and alb <dig> remains an issue for further study.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a scenario of the evolutionary history of the yidc/oxa/alb <dig> family  mainly based on the results generated from this study. in this model, yidc gene arose in some euryarchaea and all bacteria, and later in some gram-positive bacteria the gene duplicated to produce two copies. the eukaryotic oxa, alb <dig> have two separate prokaryotic origins, which might not be directly related to the endosymbiotic origins of mitochondria and chloroplasts. an early oxa duplication in the common ancestor of eukaryotes led to oxa <dig> and oxa <dig>  and thus most eukaryotes generally bear two oxa. however, secondary loss, duplication or acquisition of new domain also occurred on oxa genes in some lineages, especially in protists, resulting in a rich diversity or adaptive differentiation of the translocase in these lineages. a subsequent alb <dig> duplication led to the origin of alb <dig>  and alb <dig>  in green algae, and one of them was lost and the other underwent another duplication and generated two other alb <dig> copies  in the evolution of land plants. in diatoms, another duplication of alb <dig> occurred and produced alb3- <dig> and alb3- <dig>  alb <dig> genes were also lost partially  or completely  in eukaryotes that either lost the plastids entirely or only retain a relic plastid. this model outlines the evolutionary history of the oxa/alb3/yidc family in the three domains of life.
