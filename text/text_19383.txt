BACKGROUND
in contrast to the compact structure of the human mitochondrial genome , higher plant mitochondria are extremely complex in their constitution, and their process of evolution is enigmatic. in addition, although animal mitochondrial genomes are relatively conserved in size, from homo sapiens to mus musculus, the genomic content of plant mitochondria is highly divergent, ranging from an estimated  <dig> to  <dig>  kb  <cit> . the conservation of simple circular mitochondrial dna that is seen in animals is even in doubt in plants, and a number of studies have predicted that the genetic information of plant mitochondria is partitioned into subgenomes  <cit> . finally, in addition to the  <dig> housekeeping genes also found in animals, plants contain numerous open reading flames  with unknown functions as well as genes with known functions, such as ribosomal protein subunit-encoding genes, that are not observed in the animal genomes. although most of these orfs are considered to be non-functional and suppressed during development, some studies have reported that several orfs are transcribed  <cit> . these mysteries of the mitochondria are certainly intriguing in view of the co-evolution of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. to date, seven mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced from plant species: four from dicot species, arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , beta vulgaris  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit> , and nicotiana tabacum  <cit> , and three from monocot species, oryza sativa  <cit> , zea mays  <cit> , and triticum aestivum  <cit> . these studies have shown that plant mitochondrial genomes are actually divergent in their non-coding sequences and even in their gene-coding regions; for instance, the presence of ribosomal protein subunit-encoding genes is known to be quite inconsistent among species  <cit> .

cytoplasmic male sterility  is a maternally inherited male sterile trait, and a significant amount of evidence indicates that this phenomenon stems from alteration of the mitochondrial genome  <cit> . in many cases, the product of the unique gene structure in the cms mitochondrial genome, consisting of a chimeric structure of endogenous gene fragments and an alien sequence, has been demonstrated to be associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane  <cit> . most of these mitochondrial cms-associated genes  are thought to form a pore within the membrane and, although the details of the mechanism from pore-forming to cms occurrence have not been fully elucidated, it is speculated that mcags are responsible for cms. since cms is often associated with cytoplasmic substitutions, such as successive backcrossing of distantly related strains, cms is the key phenomenon that may shed some light on plant mitochondrial-nuclear interactions.

studies of the cms mitochondrial genomes in b. vulgaris  <cit>  and z. mays  <cit>  revealed the presence of several large recombination events compared to normal cytoplasm. satoh et al.  <cit>  sequenced the owen-cms mitochondrial genome in sugar beet, and a comparison with the non-cms mitochondria revealed the existence of several cms-specific orfs generated by the genomic rearrangements. presatp <dig> was later determined to be the best candidate for mcag, and the gene products of presatp <dig> were localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane in the form of a homo-oligomer  <cit> . allen et al.  <cit>  sequenced five distinct mitochondrial genomes in maize and detected massive genomic recombinations among the lines. even two of the normal cytoplasms which were sequenced, na and nb, were significantly dissimilar to each other, and it was estimated that there were  <dig> genomic rearrangements between the lines. they reported that genome sizes of the lines ranged from  <dig>  bp in cms-t to  <dig>  bp in cms-c  <cit> .

the  <dig> -bp mitochondrial genome of rice  japonica cultivar nipponbare was sequenced, and  <dig> protein-encoding genes,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna genes were predicted  <cit> . when the existence of the master circle was assumed, at least three large duplications  were found, and portions of plastid and nuclear sequences were frequently inserted, making the genome even more complex. the mitochondrial genome of the indica strain 93- <dig> was also assembled, and it was predicted to possess  <dig> -bp nucleotides  <cit> . at the same time, the  <dig> -bp mitochondrial genome was assembled for the strain pa64s carrying japonica cytoplasm. a total of  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were predicted between 93- <dig> and pa64s, but the differences in their overall genomic structures were rather conservative, in comparison to the report that the sequence arrangements of two normal cytoplasms from maize were never in parallel  <cit> .

based on this background, our intention was to determine whether the characteristics of cms mitochondrial sequences of rice are comparable with those of maize or sugar beet. in rice, more than  <dig> types of cms have been reported ; however, the mitochondrial sequence has not yet been revealed for any cms rice. in this study, we employed two independent cms lines, ld-cms and cw-cms, derived from the burmese strain lead rice  and from the chinese wild rice strain w <dig> , respectively. using the nipponbare mitochondrial sequence as a reference, we chose the high-throughput pyrosequencing method to gather information about the rice cms mitochondrial genomes. a number of genomic rearrangement events were detected between the two cms mitochondria in comparison with that of nipponbare.

RESULTS
sequence assemblies and assessment of genomic arrangements in cw-cms and ld-cms mitochondrial genomes
the cw-cms mitochondrial genome was assembled to  <dig> -bp single circular sequences, whereas the ld-cms mitochondrial genome was predicted to have  <dig>  bp when the master circle was hypothesized. when compared with the previously assembled nipponbare , pa64s , and 93- <dig>   <cit>  genomes, the sequence length of the two cms lines differed greatly . thus, we speculated that the predicted mitochondrial genomic organization of the cms lines is quite inconsistent with that of the known cultivars. we plotted the syntenic regions via the bl2seq algorithm using the nipponbare sequence, excluding three large  duplicated regions . when the entire nipponbare sequence including duplicated regions  was plotted against its truncated version , we detected the presence of three large redundant regions in the same positions where we deleted duplications. however, when we plotted the sequences from the two cms lines to the same reference genome , we found that the syntenic regions were largely discrepant in their genomic positions . in comparison with nipponbare, which has three large duplications , we predicted five duplications in the cw-cms genome and one in the ld-cms genome . this feature is consistent with the observation in maize mitochondrial comparative sequence analysis that the large duplications accounted for most of the genome size increases in mitochondria  <cit> , and the largest genome  outnumbered the smallest genome  in large duplication events. the number of recombination events was at least 15-fold higher in the cw-cms genome compared to nipponbare and at least 12-fold higher in the ld-cms genome. the hypothetical master circle of cms mitochondrial genomes is displayed in figure  <dig>

comparison of nucleotide sequences in genic regions
we compared nucleotide sequences among five mitochondrial genomes: nipponbare, pa64s, 93- <dig>  and the two cms lines. first,  <dig> protein-encoding genes ,  <dig> trna genes , and three rrna genes found in nipponbare were searched in the other genomes . including genes of unknown functions and ribosomal protein subunits, the appearances of the majority of the genes were constant among the five genomes. an exception was found for two orfs which were missing from the cw-cms genome. due to the n-terminal deletion, the orf152b found in nipponbare was shortened to an orf of  <dig> amino acids in the cw-cms genome . only the n-terminus  <dig> bp sequences of orf <dig> were present in cw-cms , whereas the orf288-like sequence was present but elongated to an orf encoding  <dig> amino acids with a recombination event at the sequence corresponding to its n-terminal region in the ld-cms genome .

* two nucleotide mutations resulted in one amino acid exchange.

* orf elongation by nucleotide changes in the n-terminal region. l162p is the amino acid change in orf <dig> basis.

we found four non-synonymous mutations in the cw-cms genome . two point mutations caused a single amino acid change from arginine to glycine  in rps <dig> in the cw-cms genome . for rps <dig>  two point mutations caused two amino acid changes, k183n and f184y . on the other hand, no amino acid changes were detected in the protein encoded by the ld-cms genome in comparison to that of nipponbare , other than the 6-bp deletion in the pseudo-rps <dig> gene-like structure similarly observed in cw. the presence and the sequences of the electron chain subunit-encoding genes, nad, cob, cox, and atp, were completely conserved among the cms lines and nipponbare.

evaluation of known snps in 93- <dig> vs pa64s
as the genomic arrangements of the cms lines and the previously sequenced cultivars were quite divergent , alignment of the whole genomes to detect snps or indels was difficult. thus, we decided to analyze  <dig> snps,  <dig> indels, and three segmental sequence variations  detected by comparing 93- <dig> and pa64s in the study by tian et al.  <cit> . the genotypes in the sequence variations are summarized in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  of the non-redundant  <dig> snps, only  <dig> snps were detectable in the cw-cms and ld-cms genomes, due to genomic deletions . all of the snp genotypes in the cw-cms and ld-cms genomes were the same . approximately 57% of the snp genotypes were the same as those shared by the two japonica genomes ;  <dig> % were shared with the indica strain 93- <dig>   <dig> % with pa64s ,  <dig> % with snps shared by 93- <dig> and nipponbare , and  <dig> % were unique to the two cms genomes.

non-redundant indels and ssvs were also surveyed and, in parallel to the snps, the genotypes of the two cms lines were completely identical . approximately 81% of the genotypes in the cms lines were equal to japonica type, whereas  <dig> % were equal to 93- <dig> type. one indel was highly variable, and we were able to distinguish all lines in this region except for the cms lines . from the above results, the cms genomes were rather close to japonica genomes when only the nucleotide sequences were taken into consideration. overall, the sequence variations that we could detect between the two cms lines encompassed: the elongation of orf <dig> into orf <dig> in the ld-cms genome, whereas orf <dig> was lost from the cw-cms genome; the absence of orf152b from the cw-cms genome; and mutations in rps <dig> and rps <dig> . direct sequence comparison of the syntenic regions of the cw-cms and ld-cms mitochondrial genomes revealed  <dig> snps and indels in total. comparison of the syntenic regions of the cw-cms and nipponbare genome revealed  <dig> snps and inddels, although it is possible in this case that some of these differences may result from the different sequencing technologies employed. thus the two cms genomes were relatively similar to one another in comparison to the other mitochondrial genomes. the phylogenetic relationship estimated from all snps of both genic and non-genic regions is displayed as a dendrogram in additional file  <dig> 

gene structures unique in cms lines
similar to the studies that reported cms-specific gene structures in the cms mitochondrial genome of other species  <cit> , we also found dna rearrangements generating several cms-specific structures. we previously identified a b-atp6-orf79-like structure in the ld-cms mitochondrial genome, l-atp6-orf <dig>  <cit> . orf <dig> is the strongest mcag candidate in bt-cms rice  <cit> . pyrosequencing enabled us to analyze the surrounding region of l-atp6-orf <dig> . l-atp6-orf <dig> was on the long syntenic atp <dig> region with nipponbare, but  <dig> -bp alien sequences were inserted immediately after atp <dig> . the insertion of  <dig>  bp resulted in the generation of orf <dig>  we have yet to determine the origin of the insertion sequences, but at least we were able to determine that the sequence was not present in nipponbare, pa64s, 93- <dig>  or the cw-cms line. the l-atp6-orf <dig> transcripts are co-transcribed in the cms line and the inter-genic region of the transcripts is cleaved by the action of the fertility restorer gene rf <dig>  <cit> . the precise expression analysis of this l-atp6-orf <dig> locus was conducted in our previous study  <cit> .

cw-cms-specific genomic structures were found in the region around the rpl <dig> locus with exclusive genomic recombination involving the orf <dig> locus . in nipponbare, rpl <dig> was located upstream of atp <dig>   <dig>  kb apart from it. in contrast, in the cw-cms genome, the promoter region of rpl <dig> was substituted with other genomic regions by homologous recombination . this recombination resulted in the insertion of nucleotides for  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus of rps <dig>  but the insertion was not considered to affect the rpl <dig> orf structure because of the stop codon between partial rps <dig> and rpl <dig> . full-length rps <dig> was found in another location in the cw-cms genome .

a rather interesting finding was the fate of the region around the atp <dig> locus because it was involved in the generation of the chimeric orf gene, which was comprised of multiple recombination events . the upstream region of atp <dig> was fused to a 294-bp sequence of orf <dig> corresponding to its n-terminal region , and it was further followed by  <dig> -bp unknown sequences and finally linked to the trnr region which is  <dig>  kb away from atp <dig> in nipponbare . the  <dig> -bp unknown sequence found in this locus was not found in the nipponbare, pa64s, 93- <dig>  or ld-cms genomes, although some of its fragments showed 85% similarity to orf <dig> . as we stated previously, a part of orf <dig> was present in this region but the full-length copy was not present. the newly identified gene in this locus, possibly encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids, was designated as cw-orf <dig>  the structures of the rpl <dig> and cw-orf <dig> loci identified by pyrosequencing were verified by sequencing the lambda clones covering these regions .

genomic structures unique in cms lines
in order to evaluate the uniqueness of these genomic structures, distribution of the ld- and cw-specific structures and genes was surveyed in the national institute of agrobiological sciences  global rice core collection consisting of  <dig> accessions of worldwide cultivars  <cit> . this rice collection retains 90% of rflp alleles detected in about  <dig> accessions selected based on the passport data from the whole rice collection  maintained at the nias genebank  <cit> . nine wild rice strains , which had previously been reported to carry a cms cytoplasm  <cit> , were also included in this study, so that  <dig> accessions were tested in total. six primers able to amplify the contig linkage regions  unique in the two cms lines in comparison with nipponbare were used to detect each amplicon by pcr. table  <dig> summarizes the results of pcr amplification and accessions were categorized into  <dig> mitochondrial haplogroups . no amplicon was observed in any of the accessions using primer pairs cw_ <dig> or ld_ <dig> . thus, the genomic rearrangement detected by primer pair cw_ <dig>  which corresponds to the region between the atp <dig> and rrn <dig> or rps <dig> genes in cw-cms , and the rearrangement detected by the primer pair ld_ <dig>  which corresponds to the region between cox <dig> and trnr in ld-cms , were completely unique to each cms line. the range of the proportion of the accessions with amplification by four other primer pairs  was  <dig>  -  <dig> %. similar to the genomic structure detected by primer pair cw_ <dig>  cw-orf <dig> was solely present in the cw-cms line . excluding two o. rufipogon accessions , the presence of the atp6-orf <dig> structure was completely linked with the amplification pattern of ld_ <dig>  as expected from the closeness of the two regions . lastly, distribution of the orf288-like gene in rice accessions was assessed, as the gene was not present in the cw-cms genome . thirty-five accessions carried the orf288-like structure, whereas no amplification was observed in the other lines.

expression analysis of genes involved in the recombination events
we investigated whether the genes involved in the recombination to generate the chimeric cw-orf <dig> locus were affected in terms of their expression patterns. as a result, cox <dig>  orf <dig>  orf <dig>  atp <dig>  cox <dig>  trnr, rpl <dig>  and rps <dig> were expressed in the cw-cms calli , whereas the orf <dig> transcripts were extensively reduced in the cw-cms line . due to the recombination event with rps <dig>  rpl <dig> probably acquired a new promoter and, as a result, transcript elongation of rpl <dig> occurred .

for cw-orf <dig>  the regions that do not include partial orf <dig> were used as probes . we detected a faint band in taichung  <dig>  the japonica nuclear donor for the cw-cms line, using probe  <dig>  the detection of this slight signal in taichung  <dig> might have occurred via the orf224-like region in probe  <dig> and the two regions showing more than 85% identity with orf <dig> . on the other hand, we detected a cw-mitochondria-specific rna expression using probes  <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting that the downstream regions of cw-orf <dig> were co-transcribed . although we checked to see if the presence of the gametophytic restorer gene, rf <dig> for cw-cms, would have any effects on the transcript regulation of cw-orf <dig> in anthers, no differences in transcript patterns were observed between a cms line and a cw-restorer line, cwr, carrying rf <dig> and cw-cytoplasm .

discussion
we obtained the entire mitochondrial genome sequences of two rice cms lines of distinct origin. the master circle of the cw-cms mitochondrial genome was predicted to contain  <dig>  bp, whereas that of the ld-cms genome had  <dig>  bp. from a comparison with the recently assembled nipponbare , pa64s , and 93- <dig>  mitochondrial sequences  <cit> , we found that the cms genomes were exclusively rearranged . based on the novel genomic rearrangements and unique orfs discovered in this study, the mitochondrial haplogroups of the rice cultivars were divided into at least  <dig> groups . it is highly likely that several mitochondrial genomic rearrangements occurred during rice breeding; apparently some rearrangements had deleted the cms-specific genomic structures . for instance, the strongest mcag candidate of cw-cms, cw-orf <dig>  was absent from all of the other strains tested . the gene product of cw-orf <dig> was predicted to be strongly hydrophobic by sosui  <cit> , which is consistent with the characteristics of previously known mcag products  <cit> . although we failed to detect a transcriptional alteration of cw-orf <dig> in the presence of rf <dig>  it is still possible that rf <dig> could be related to translational regulation of cw-orf <dig>  the presence of orf <dig> was observed in seven cultivars and in most of the o. rufipogon accessions that were previously reported to carry cms cytoplasm  <cit> , but orf <dig> was lost from the other cultivars presumably during rice breeding history . the reason we speculate that orf <dig> was "lost" from majority of cultivars is because o. rufipogon genomes are generally considered as the ancestors of o. sativa cultivars.

the complete copies of orf152b and orf <dig> predicted in the nipponbare genome were not present in the cw-cms mitochondrial genome. furthermore, a copy of orf <dig> was present in the cw-cms genome, but its expression was unexpectedly suppressed , possibly due to alteration of the transcriptional efficiency by the snp  <dig> bp upstream of the initiation codon atg or the two-nucleotide substitutions within the coding region . as orf152b and orf <dig> were expressed in nipponbare , as was orf <dig> in this study , we hypothesize that these orfs are genes. therefore, the genetic functions of orf152b, orf <dig>  and orf <dig> were apparently missing or knocked down in the cw-cms mitochondrial genome. among these genes, the introduction of orf <dig> in the cultivars seemingly occurred during the rice breeding process. in fact, orf <dig> was present in only  <dig> accessions out of the  <dig> 'core-collection' cultivars and in no accessions from o. rufipogon, indicating that the acquirement of orf <dig> at least had definitely occurred during the breeding history . the absence of orf <dig> in approximately half of the cultivars indicates that this gene is obviously not necessary for pollen fertility. thus the possibility that a loss of function of orf <dig> in the cw-cms line is causing cms is not likely, because again absence of orf <dig> apparently does not induce male sterility in such cultivars lacking orf <dig>  whether orf <dig> itself can be directly involved in cms is still an open question, but it may be postulated that the presence of orf <dig> has contributed to the evolution of a new chimeric cms gene as a segment of approximately  <dig> amino acids of orf <dig> is identical to cox <dig> , persuading us that orf <dig> is a chimeric gene. therefore, we conclude that compelling evidence of the 'death' of mcag via genomic rearrangements during cultivation was demonstrated in this study and, contrarily, that the generation of genes such as orf <dig> may be part of the 'birth' process. the 'death' idea is also supported by the fact that the atp6-orf79-like structure was lost from a large proportion of the cultivars .

the actual mechanism underlying the process of mcag is considered to be substoichiometric shifting , which involves the idea that the copy numbers of multipartite mitochondrial genomic molecules  change over generations  <cit> . interactive recombinations between repeat regions within subgenomes create novel genomic rearrangements, and these novel subgenomes may be present in low copy numbers at first, but they can proliferate and become the majority in subsequent generations by sss  <cit> . it has actually been proven that the knockdown of the homologue of the escherichia coli mismatch repair component in tomato and tobacco unsuppressed the mitochondrial recombination events, and that it eventually caused artificial cms possibly intermediated by sss  <cit> . therefore, quantitative measurement of the genomic rearrangements we found in the above experiments should provide us with a clearer picture of how the evolution of mcag took place during rice breeding.

a cms genome determination study of sugar beet reported a few cms-specific chimeric structures, other than the best mcag candidate, presatp <dig>  <cit> . maize cms sequencing detected one chimeric orf other than mcag t-urf <dig> in cms-t; none were detected other than the best mcag candidate orf <dig> in cms-s; and none were detected in cms-c under the 70-amino-acid cut-off criterion  <cit> . whether this is meaningful or not, we found  <dig> orfs in the nipponbare genome,  <dig> in the cw-cms genome, and  <dig> in the ld-cms genome, using the same 70-amino-acid cut-off criterion. out of the ones that were not present in nipponbare, none except for the ones we listed  contained a significant portion of the other known genes. whether any one of these kinds of orfs is actually related to cms is still unknown, and it should be emphasized again that nipponbare as well contains genes that were not described as related to known mitochondrial biological processes but are actually transcribed. the transcribed proportion of these predicted orfs is undetermined but, based on our current knowledge, detection of any protein products of these genes has not yet been reported  <cit> .

on the other hand, the generation and maintenance of a novel chimeric orf may be allowed by the presence of certain nuclear genes. possible candidates of such nuclear-encoded genes are pentatricopeptide repeat -motif containing genes as discussed below. pprs are now undoubtedly considered to be involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation events, mostly in plant organelles  <cit> . in higher plant species  <dig> to  <dig> ppr genes are encoded, and there is concrete evidence demonstrating that orthologous ppr pairs exist between rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . most of the rf genes  identified to date have been demonstrated to encode a ppr protein  <cit> . pprs encoded by rf genes  are exceptional because they are not conserved among the species  <cit> ; they are curiously present as heavily duplicated clusters of rf-ppr-like genes in the genome. this feature resembles that of diversifying selection acting on the evolution of the disease resistance r genes  <cit> . there have been a few implications that rf-pprs are actually positively selected  <cit> . one perspective involves the expectation that some rf-ppr-like genes may be responsible for preventing protein accumulations from certain predicted orfs that are transcribed but untranslated  <cit> . there has been no concrete evidence demonstrating that the evolution of rf-pprs is related to the generation of novel orfs in mitochondria; however, there certainly must be a selective constraint to the diversifying selection of the rf-pprs, in the same manner as there are pathogens restricting the evolution of the r genes. our current study suggested that rice mitochondrial genomic rearrangement is an on-going event, and it seems quite reasonable to consider that frequent novel orf generation as a consequence is the driving force of rf-ppr diversification.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the mitochondrial genomes of the two cms lines are greatly reorganized in comparison with that of nipponbare. there appear to be a few genomic structures that are relevant to cms, and finding these structures within rice cultivars and wild accessions provided us with the idea that genomic recombination events during rice breeding history diminished these unique genomic structures of cms and, on the other hand, presumably gave rise to novel orfs.
