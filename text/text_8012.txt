BACKGROUND
at the onset of evolutionary theory it was observed that “species of the same genus have usually  some similarity in habits and constitution” . that is, closely related species or lineages are expected to be more similar in ecology than to more distantly related taxa because of their more recent common ancestry  <cit> . accordingly, it has been observed that under changing environmental conditions organisms tend to retain their ancestral ecological characteristics rather than evolving into a new ecological niche  <cit> .

large-scale global climate change dramatically alters the distribution of major biomes  <cit> , and thus the ecological niches available to entire taxonomic groups  <cit> . during the early eocene climatic optimum, c.  <dig> million years  ago, tropical biomes dominated the earth’s surface even at high latitudes  <cit> . within the last  <dig> ma, however, the world has experienced a transition: a fluctuating but overall decrease in mean temperatures  <cit>  that shifted the distribution of frost-intolerant plants towards the equatorial zones. the flowering plant families araceae  <cit> , chloranthaceae  <cit> , and malpighiaceae  <cit>  are well-studied examples of formerly more widely distributed lineages that are currently mostly restricted to the tropics.

only some lineages of flowering plants have managed the transition from tropical to temperate climates  <cit> , despite presumably having had ample opportunities to do so with the neogene expansion of temperate habitats  <cit> . adaptation to cold is supposed to involve complex reorganizations of the genome and physiology  <cit> , implying that the evolution of tolerances to temperate climates with highly seasonal conditions may pose particular problems  <cit> , especially for warm-adapted plant taxa confronted with cooling climate  <cit> . in contrast, all extant plant lineages that do occur in temperate areas underwent adaptation to cooler climates at some point  <cit> . also, in an area that undergoes environmental changes and that lacks suitable migration routes, only such resident lineages will survive that can develop the relevant traits necessary to persist  <cit> . in a recent study of angiosperms, zanne et al. suggest that “many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold”  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been suggested that in the absence of obvious key innovations, climate cooling may have acted as an important driver of diversification, e.g., in the hyper-diverse genus carex  <cit> .

we provide a macroevolutionary study of the genus hypericum l.  in the context of changing global climate conditions during the neogene. hypericum belongs to the clusioid clade of the malpighiales  <cit> , which, apart from hypericum, is almost exclusively composed of tropical taxa . more than 80% of the known species within the family hypericaceae occur within hypericum  <cit> ; the remaining 20% consist of tropical plants from four genera  <cit>  in the tribes vismieae choisy  and cratoxyleae benth. & hook.f. .figure  <dig> distribution map of hypericaceae and collection sites. blue shading and collection sites  in red mark the distribution of hypericum . grey shading and collection sites in light-grey mark the distribution of the tropical members of the family .



hypericum has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution  with a primary center of species-richness in the temperate regions of eurasia  <cit> . in temperate regions, hypericum species are mostly native to low- and mid-elevation areas, while in the tropics they are almost always confined to high-elevation mountains, such as the south american andes or mountains in topical africa  <cit> . the divergence time of the hypericum crown node has been estimated to the upper eocene, c.  <dig> ma ago  <cit> , based on a single  fossil calibration. the same study reconstructed the western palearctic as the ancestral area for hypericum. however, sánchez meseguer et al.  <cit>  employed a bayesian approach  <cit>  that limits ancestral areas to only single states in the reconstruction . for a genus like hypericum that has several species that span very wide geographic ranges, this assumption is likely inadequate.

within an otherwise pantropic clade  <cit>  hypericum is a cold-adapted but species-rich lineage. because the clade is of worldwide cold/temperate distribution and evolved during the paleaogene to neogene  climate transition, hypericum is ideal for studying the effects of broad-scale climate change on plant distribution and diversification. furthermore, the evolution of morphological characters in the genus has been studied at length  <cit> , providing a foundation to further investigate evolutionary patters and processes in hypericum.

in this study, we test the hypotheses that  hypericum originated in the western palearctic prior to the oligocene, as suggested by meseguer et al.  <cit> , that  the occupation of temperate environments is derived in the hypericaceae and a distinctive characteristic of hypericum, and that  it has stimulated the radiation of this lineage globally. to do so, we estimate a species phylogeny based on nuclear and chloroplast sequence variation. we calibrate our time-tree using six fossils and compare the effect on node ages of the specific assignment of the oldest known fossil in hypericum. to evaluate historical biogeography, we employ parametric models that allow for the incorporation of paleogeographic information. applying recently developed bayesian approaches, we estimate the magnitude and placement of climatic niche shifts, and investigate the impact of the transition from the tropical into the cold/temperate climate niche by assessing the placement of shifts in diversification rates.

RESULTS
hypericaceae phylogenetics
maximum likelihood  topologies were similar for both chloroplast  and nuclear  data. discordance between nuclear and chloroplast trees was present only in two places, although without strong support . thus, we concatenated the chloroplast and nuclear sequence data into a combined data set, which contained  <dig> % missing data .

we included  <dig> representative species  in the combined sequence data set that contained  <dig> nucleotide positions after alignment and removal of ambiguous sites. phylogenetic inference revealed the same major groups as reported in other studies  <cit> , but with strong support . most basal splits within hypericum, however, lack sufficient support, a result also revealed in previous studies that included deeper sampling  <cit> . ten major clades consistent with current taxonomy are present within hypericaceae , allowing us to assign species richness to each clade for comparative analyses .figure  <dig> dated phylogeny of hypericaceae detailing historical biogeography.  present occurrence of species is marked at the tips of the tree using the color code defined in the map top right. multiple occurrences are indicated. historical distribution of ancestral populations is given at nodes in the tree . node bars indicate the 95% highest posterior density  produced in divergence time estimation a. vertical bars define the clades used to assign species-richness in the diversification rates analysis.  comparison of ancestral areas optimized for the hypericum crown node under two dec models, the stratified  and the uncostrained . maps illustrate the reconstructed distribution of ancestral populations and bar charts the likelihood of range optimization . global temperature  is given below the geological time scale. grey vertical bars indicate major climatic events . note that the cold adapted hypericum lineage splits form its tropical sister and starts to diversify during periods of climate cooling.



divergence times depend on fossil assignment
bayesian estimation of divergence times was done by assigning the oldest known fossil in hypericum as a minimum time constraint to  the stem node, and  to the crown node of hypericum . for both analyses, we tested the effect of missing data on age estimates using a reduced data set that did not contain any missing data. results of the complete sampling and the reduced data sets were congruent, regardless of the calibration approach used, deviating maximally at the hypericum node with less than  <dig>  ma in mean ages .table  <dig>

ancestral area estimation is equivocal at the hypericum crown node
ancestral areas were optimized over both divergence time estimations taking phylogenetic uncertainty into account by analyzing a posterior subset of  <dig> trees. additionally, two models were compared which differed in their dispersal/extinction probabilities both between areas and over time; a stratified m <dig> model that accounts for varying connectivity of areas over time , and a unconstrained m <dig> model with equal probabilities of movement between areas at any time . the ancestral areas estimated per node were highly congruent in all analyses, except for four nodes for which the ancestral states differed . two of these affected nodes are located at basal dichotomies, one at the hypericum crown node , and one at the ‘ascyreia s.l.’ crown node. in all four cases of incongruence, and independent of the used age estimation, the evidence ratio  <cit>  is generally higher in the stratified model when compared to unconstrained model .

niche shifts during the evolution of the hypericum stem lineage in the oligocene
we used the first principal components  scores obtained from a phylogenetic pca as an approximation of the climatic niche. the pc <dig> scores were dominated by the thermal bioclim variables , and account for c. 34% of the variation within the data. bayesian fitting of multi-optima ou models to the approximation of the climatic niche space estimated the placement and magnitude of two shifts. both shifts were estimated to have occurred in the oligocene, the first shift during the evolution of the stem lineage of hypericum, and the second shift one divergence event latter at the stem lineage of the mrca of ‘core hypericum’ – ‘triadenum . both shift magnitudes were negative, indicating a niche shift into colder climates during the early evolution of hypericum . the phylogenetic half-life /α =  <dig>  ma; based on a rate of adaptation of α =  <dig> , and a total tree length of  <dig>  ma) signifies that the movement to the primary climatic optimum in hypericum was rapid and resembles an ou process rather than brownian motion  <cit> .

diversification rate shifts in hypericum in the miocene
in the hypericaceae, two shifts in diversification dynamics were detected within hypericum with strong support:  at the stem lineage of ‘core hypericum + ascyreia s.l.’, and  with the divergence of central- and south american ‘brathys s.l.’ from its relatives . in both dating approaches, the same clades are identified to show diversification rate shifts comparing the bayesian credible sets of distinct shift configurations . in the analysis using the dating approach a, the first increase in diversification rates is inferred to have occurred at about  <dig>  ma with a marginal probability of  <dig> , and the second at about  <dig>  ma with a marginal probability of  <dig> , resulting in a rate of  <dig>  and  <dig>  species per million year, respectively .

discussion
historical biogeography of hypericaceae
there is strong evidence that the mrca of hypericaceae occurred in africa in the eocene , a result also recovered in a previous study  <cit> . the mrcas of the tropical taxa within the hypericaceae  are revealed to have occurred in africa + southeastern asia and africa + south america, respectively. during the early eocene the higher thermal maximum allowed megathermal organisms, such as the mrca of hypericaceae, to disperse throughout the northern hemisphere, which explains the vicariance of many tropical lineages  <cit> .

at the onset of worldwide climate cooling, c.  <dig> ma the hypericum stem lineage split from its tropical relatives. the ancestral area estimated for the mrca of hypericum is in the northern hemisphere, either solely in the western palaearctic, or more widely distributed between the western palaearctic and the nearctic . the nearctic has been connected to the western palearctic through islands that could have easily functioned as stepping-stones facilitating dispersal over the north atlantic  <cit> . seeds of hypericum are tiny, ca.  <dig>  to  <dig>  mm long, and are easily dispersed by birds or strong winds  <cit> , promoting long-distance dispersal. however, an ancestral distribution from the western palaearctic to the nearctic is somewhat surprising given the fact that the oldest known fossil is from siberia and sw china  <cit> . differential extinction may explain the partial absence of reconstructed ancestral populations in the areas of the oldest fossil record  <cit> . hence, the assumption of a widespread mrca of hypericum from the palaearctic to the nearctic connected via beringia  <cit>  would be plausible as well. on the other hand, it is likely that the fossil record does not accurately represent actual ancestral distributions, and thus, may be misleading for ancestral area estimations. regardless, hypericum is of northern hemisphere origin, likely around the late tethys estuaries in the palaearctic  <cit> , perhaps as part of a deciduous mixed-mesophytic forest  <cit> . the ecology of basal lineages within hypericum, however, is diverse reaching from dry rocky mediterranean to shallow aquatic habitats, and montane cloud forests. thus, extensive differential extinction of intermediate ancestral populations  and/or intercontinental long-distance colonization early in the evolutionary history is needed to explain biogeographic patterns in hypericum.

cold adaptation in the hypericum stem lineage but later diversification
initially, no speciation seems to have taken place in hypericum – or extinction may have erased the evidence of earlier divergence in the genus leading to a stem lineage of c.  <dig> million years . however, the genesis of modern species diversity in hypericum traces to c.  <dig> ma , after the oligocene climate cooling caused a substantial decrease in mean temperatures  <cit> . this worldwide cooling, which led to a period of rather constant cold temperatures  <cit> , initiated the expansion of temperate habitats in the northern hemisphere, replacing the more tropical vegetation dominant during the eocene  <cit> . with the exception of hypericum, the remaining lineages of hypericaceae stayed in tropical climates, i.e. their distributions experienced a restriction with the retreat of tropical areas towards equatorial zones after the eocene thermal maximum  <cit> . in contrast, hypericum adapted to colder climates c.  <dig> ma  and consequently dispersed and diversified in temperate habitats. the adaptation towards the new climatic optimum  was rapid, meaning that hypericum species were well adapted to the cold/temperate niche  <cit> . hence, following this initial niche shift, hypericum never completely left the colder climates. even in equatorial areas, hypericum is only found at high elevations with a cool climate, such as the south american andes and the high mountains of africa.

two shifts in diversification rates were detected with strong support in hypericum . the first is an increase in speciation rates that coincides with a sudden decrease of temperature during the middle miocene climate transition at about  <dig> ma  <cit> . the second increase in speciation rates was likely the result of dispersal into the south american continent and may have been triggered by the orogeny of the andes  <cit> . that is, the adaptation of hypericum to colder climates first evolved during the oligocene but diversification rates increased c. 13– <dig> million years later during the miocene, in nested clades within hypericum. the evolution of a shrubby habit at the hypericum stem lineage  <cit>  might well be a life history trait that facilitated the initial adaptation to cold  <cit> , but no obvious intrinsic  traits that could be interpreted as key innovations were identified for these rapidly diversifying clades  <cit> . however, our results suggest that cold tolerance is likely an important initial adaptation that was exploited when new biogeographic opportunities were presented . only after a long lag phase when global temperatures dramatically decreased following the mid-miocene thermal optimum  <cit> , did changing environments and expanding temperate regions  allow hypericum to spread and diversify. because c. 42% of extant hypericum species are found in montane biomes , we postulate that the onset of extensive mountain formation in eurasia and the americas  <cit>  is likely to have contributed to both detected rate shifts.

CONCLUSIONS
after divergence from its tropical relatives, adaptation towards colder climates c.  <dig> ma ago enabled hypericum to stay in the northern hemisphere, while its tropical relatives experienced habitat restriction towards equatorial zones. this niche shift offered dispersal and possible diversification opportunities in the expanding temperate areas in the northern hemisphere during the oligocene. after the last thermal maximum in the miocene, massive mountain formations and further climate cooling may have stimulated the radiation of this lineage globally. as a consequence, cold-adapted hypericum contains 80% of the species present in the family. despite its worldwide distribution and tropical ancestry, even the species growing in the tropics retain their temperate climate niche by growing exclusively in cool climates of higher elevation habitats.

higher species richness in temperate climates is rather atypical and contrary to the usual pattern observed in plants where tropical groups generally tend to have more species than temperate relatives  <cit> . however, our findings mirror patterns described in sedges   <cit> , and to varying extents in buttercups   <cit> , grasses   <cit> , and heaths   <cit> .

we have demonstrated that a pronounced lag phase is present between the initial niche shift and diversification in new habitats. therefore, we conclude that the disproportionate species numbers of hypericum in comparison to its tropical relatives are not only a result of initial cold-climate adaptation. our analyses indicate a relatively late increase in speciation rate, i.e. with the onset of further cooling and especially mountain formation during the upper miocene . likewise, carex, the most diverse non-tropical sedge lineage   <cit>  has a stem lineage of c.  <dig> million years, with most extant lineages having diversified subsequent to the oligocene in montane biomes. thus, we emphasize that both  a niche shift following the eocene thermal optimum as a precondition for the presence of cold-adapted lineages in temperate regions, and  an extrinsic trait , i.e. the availability of emerging temperate and/or mountain habitats, are key events potentially triggering diversification rates in these cold-adapted, species-rich plant groups.
