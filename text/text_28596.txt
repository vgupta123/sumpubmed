BACKGROUND
dormancy is a key feature of perennial plants. during dormancy the meristem becomes insensitive to growth-promoting signals for a period of time, before it is released and growth resumes  <cit> . bud dormancy is a critical developmental process that allows perennial plants to survive extreme seasonal variations in climate. the regulation of dormancy is a complex process that is necessary for plant survival, development, and architecture  <cit> . a thorough understanding of regulation mechanisms controlling dormancy in woody perennials would have a variety of applications for genetic improvement of woody trees  <cit> . considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways involved in bud dormancy  <cit> . however, until recently such studies focused on regulation at the levels of transcription, post-transcription, and translation  <cit> . despite the importance of dormancy regulation for perennial behavior  <cit> , the roles of post-translational modifications, especially protein phosphorylation, remain poorly understood.

the identification of phosphorylation sites within a certain protein cannot provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory role of protein phosphorylation  <cit> . instead, the simultaneous identification of the phosphorylation status of numerous proteins at a certain developmental stage is required to decode regulatory mechanisms. large-scale mapping of phosphorylations that occur in response to diverse environmental signals has become an indispensable method for unraveling plant regulatory networks  <cit> . in recent years, advances in mass spectrometry -based protein analysis technologies, combined with phosphopeptide enrichment methods, paved the way for large-scale mapping of phosphorylation sites in vivo  <cit> . specifically, the titanium dioxide  microcolumn is an effective method to selectively enrich phosphopeptides  <cit> . there have been several studies on plant phosphoproteomes. these studies have provided large datasets that allow new insights into phosphorylation events; however, they have been carried out only on herbaceous plants, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , oilseed rape  <cit> , rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , and maize  <cit> . to date, there have been no reports on the phosphoproteomes of woody plant species, except for the identification of eight phosphorylated poplar p-proteins  <cit> .

numerous cellular signaling pathways are based on the sequential phosphorylation of an array of proteins  <cit> . therefore, the analysis of signaling pathways in plants has often focused on protein kinases. kinases show catalytic preferences for specific phosphorylation motifs with certain amino acid context sequences  <cit> . therefore, identification of in vivo phosphorylation sites can provide important information about the activity of protein kinases in their cellular context.

to better understand the regulation mechanism of phosphoproteins and cellular signaling networks during dormancy, we investigated the phosphoproteome of dormant terminal buds  of hybrid poplar  using a ms method combined with a tio <dig> phosphopeptide enrichment strategy. we identified  <dig> phosphorylation sites in  <dig> phosphopeptides from  <dig> proteins, most of which are associated with binding and catalytic activity. the information gained from this study provides a wealth of resources and novel insights to decode the complicated mechanisms of phosphorylation modifications in poplar. as far as we know, this is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of woody plants.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of the phosphoproteome of dtbs
total proteins were isolated from dtbs of poplar, and then digested with trypsin in solution. the resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to nanouplc-esi-ms/ms to identify phosphorylation modifications after tio <dig> enrichment. in total,  <dig> unique phosphorylation sites were identified in  <dig> phosphopeptides from  <dig> proteins .

1number of phosphopeptides counted according to unique sequences containing oxidized methionine or acetylated/phosphorylated residues.

among these phosphorylation sites,  <dig> %  of phosphorylation events occurred on ser and  <dig> %  on thr . this finding is consistent with previously reported phosphorylation patterns: 85% pser and  <dig> % pthr  <cit>  and 88% pser and 11% pthr  <cit>  in arabidopsis; and 86% pser and  <dig> % pthr in m. truncatula  <cit> . only  <dig> %  of the phosphorylation events of these phosphopeptides occurred on tyr residue. this is lower than the ptyr values reported for arabidopsis  and rice   <cit> , but comparable to that reported for medicago truncatula   <cit> . the results of these studies indicate that tyr phosphorylation in plants is more abundant than once thought  <cit> . the spectra representing all phosphopeptides and the original detailed data are shown in additional file  <dig>  as examples, the spectra of phosphopeptides with single pser, pthr, and ptyr are shown in figure 1a, c, and 1d, respectively. the spectrum of a phosphopeptide containing two phosphorylated ser residues is shown in figure 1b.

the majority  of the  <dig> phosphopeptides were phosphorylated at a single residue. this value is higher than that reported for arabidopsis   <cit>  and m. truncatula   <cit> . only  <dig> % of the phosphopeptides from poplar contained two phosphorylated residues, and none were phosphorylated at multiple sites. in arabidopsis and m. truncatula,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of phosphopeptides, respectively, were doubly phosphorylated  <cit>  . this may be a result of different enrichment strategies that show selective or preferred affinity for single or multiple phosphopeptides  <cit> .

in a recent phosphorylation mapping study in arabidopsis, the phosphorylation sites were concentrated outside conserved domains  <cit> . to evaluate whether this pattern also occurred among poplar phosphopeptides, we conducted pfam searches  <cit>  to obtain domain information for the  <dig> phosphoproteins. we acquired domain information of  <dig> phosphoproteins . these data showed that  <dig> % of the phosphorylation sites were located outside of conserved domains , consistent with previous results  <cit> . protein phosphorylation often leads to structural changes in proteins, and such changes can directly modulate protein activity and reflect changes in interaction partners or subcellular localization  <cit> . thus, phosphorylations outside conserved domains can be expected to alter protein conformation and functions.

conservation of phosphoproteins and phosphosites between poplar and arabidopsis
we compared phosphorylation patterns of orthologous proteins between poplar and arabidopsis to analyze conservation between their phosphoproteomes. additional file  <dig> shows orthologous proteins in poplar and arabidopsis. phosphorylation sites in poplar that were absent from their equivalent sites in proteins from other plant species were considered to be novel phosphorylation sites .

we found only  <dig> phosphoproteins that were unique to poplar, and the rest had ortholog in arabidopsis. among these ortholog, more than 75%  were phosphoproteins, and almost half of them were phosphorylated at equivalent site or neighboring site in poplar and arabidopsis . among the identified phosphosites,  <dig>  were conserved across the two species. the proteins containing these sites were involved in various physiological processes . of the  <dig> conserved sites, only  <dig> were phosphorylated in the arabidopsis ortholog, and the remaining  <dig> were novel phosphorylation sites in poplar . note that the residues at the equivalent sites of ortholog are potential phosphorylation sites, as shown in additional file  <dig>  for example, two different poplar plasma membrane h+-atpase isoforms  and their arabidopsis homologs  were phosphorylated at their well-conserved c-terminal domain . in populus trichocarpa, the lhcb <dig> protein exists as three distinct isoforms; lhcb <dig>  , lhcb <dig>   and lhcb <dig>  . in the present study, we identified two previously unknown phosphorylation sites at the n-terminus; thr <dig>  which is well conserved across the lhcb <dig> isoforms of several plants, and thr <dig>  which is not conserved across lhcb <dig> isoforms of other plants, but is present as a non-phosphorylated residue in the lhcb <dig> isoforms of arabidopsis and spinach .

recently, overlaps among medicago, rice, and arabidopsis phosphoproteomes suggested that the phosphoproteomes are similarly conserved among various herbaceous plant species, and that overlaps are not specifically dependent on experimental conditions  <cit> . in this work, we observed overlaps between the poplar and arabidopsis phosphoproteomes, providing additional evidence that phosphoproteomes overlap across plant kingdoms.

unique phosphorylation sites of poplar proteins, compared with orthologs in other plants
many physiological features of woody plants are not reflected in herbaceous models, e.g., arabidopsis or rice. in our study, several poplar phosphoproteins were highly conserved with their arabidopsis ortholog, but their corresponding phosphorylation sites were not conserved . for example, the poplar 20s proteasome subunit protein  shared high sequence similarity with its orthologs in arabidopsis , medicago truncatula , and rice . in ptrpba <dig> , there is a c-terminal motif that includes a pser residue at position  <dig>  this motif is conserved across two other ptrpba <dig> isoforms , but the equivalent sites are substituted with a non-phosphorylatable residue in the homologs in the other three species . the poplar glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase isoforms  are another good example; they share high sequence similarity with their homologs in arabidopsis , m. truncatula , and rice . however, ptrg6pd  is phosphorylated at the n-terminus at residue thr <dig> , which is conserved across poplar g6pd isoforms, but the residues at the equivalent position in g6pd isoforms of arabidopsis, medicago, and rice are non-phosphorylatable. interestingly, pser <dig> is conserved across rice g6pd orthologs, but it is substituted with a non-phosphorylatable asn residue in its arabidopsis and medicago orthologs . these findings suggest that there are unique mechanisms regulating phosphorylation in poplar.

in summary, identification of new phosphorylation sites can provide significant biological insights about the cellular mechanisms of signaling activation and inhibition. although many phosphorylation sites have been identified in arabidopsis from the phosphat database  <cit> , we identified  <dig> novel phosphosites and  <dig> novel phosphoproteins in poplar in the present study. these novel phosphoproteins and phosphorylation sites could provide useful data to identify components of phosphorylation-dependent signal cascades, and to determine the function of phosphorylation events in responses to specific environment signals.

classification of the dtb phosphoproteome
functional annotation of phosphoproteins was also conducted using the blast2go program  <cit> . sequences were searched against the non-redundant  protein database at ncbi. these identified phosphoproteins were categorized into seven major classes with diverse functions :  <dig> % were related to binding affinity . the rest were categorized as having structural molecule activity , translation  or transcription regulator activity , membrane proteins with transporter activity , and enzyme regulator activity  . in this study, most of the identified phosphoproteins were involved in binding and catalytic activity, consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

potential protein kinases involved in signal transduction during dormancy in poplar
confirmed phosphorylation sites are footprints of kinase activities. to date, several kinases have been documented in arabidopsis, and their substrate spectra and functional interactions have mainly been deciphered by large-scale investigations of phosphoproteins  <cit> . however, little is known about the kinases involved in regulating dormancy in plants. to identify the protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of the phosphosites identified in this study, we obtained putative phosphorylation motifs from the phosphopeptide dataset using the motif-x software tool . this tool extracts overrepresented patterns from any sequence dataset by comparing it to a dynamic statistical background  <cit> . four significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs were extracted from the identified dtb phosphopeptides dataset . one of the enriched phosphorylation site motifs resembled a known motif in proline-directed kinases . this was also supported by the alignment of all the identified dtb phosphorylation sites . the identity of the second enriched motif was unknown, and had no counterparts in any known kinases. the third enriched phosphorylation motif showed high similarity to a motif found in members of the casein kinase ii subfamily . members of this family can phosphorylate a wide variety of plant proteins in vitro. the fourth enriched motif was similar to the 14-3- <dig> binding motif . kinases with this motif regulate the activities of the vacuolar potassium channel kco <dig> and the vacuolar atpase  <cit>  . these results suggest that proline-directed kinases could be the major kinase group involved phosphorylation of these identified proteins during dormancy in poplar .

discussion
a series of differential expression profiling analyses of the induction, maintenance, and release of bud dormancy made it possible to identify a large set of dormancy-related candidate genes  <cit> . these genes were mainly involved in aba signaling pathways, cold and oxidative responses, flavonoid biosynthesis, flowering time, and circadian regulation  <cit> . although there is increasing information available about the roles of genes and their products in dormancy, very little is known about the relevance of protein phosphorylation in dormancy. to address this, in this work, we identified the phosphorylation status of proteins in dormant terminal buds of poplar using mass spectrometry combined with tio <dig> phosphopeptide-enrichment strategies. however, it remains unknown whether these phosphoproteins identified in dormant buds in this study actually participate in dormancy-related processes. to interpret the significance of the presence of these phosphoproteins in dormant buds, we compared the identified phosphoproteins with previously reported dormancy-related genes and their products. notably, some of these phosphoproteins were well matched to homologs of known dormancy-related candidate gene-products identified in previous studies of various species. some of these common proteins of interest are briefly discussed in the context of dormancy.

phosphoproteins involved in dormancy-related signal transduction
abscisic acid  is the major plant hormone involved in growth, dormancy, and cold acclimation  <cit> . the aba signaling pathway is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases  <cit> . genetic evidence demonstrated that sucrose non-fermenting -like protein kinase, receptor-like protein kinase , and protein phosphatases 2c  encoded by abi <dig> and abi <dig> are important regulators of the aba signaling pathway, which plays an important role in the induction or release of bud dormancy  <cit> . in this work, three snf1-type kinases in poplar  containing the phosphopeptide "dghflktscgpspnyaapevisgk", and one leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase  were phosphorylated . these phosphorylation sites were all well conserved, and corresponding phosphosites were identified in arabidopsis . in the case of pp2c, the ser <dig> in the phosphopeptide "vsgmiegliwpspr" from pp2c  was identified as a novel phosphorylation site . calmodulin  and the cam-binding protein play an important role in ca2+ signaling, which is related to bud dormancy  <cit> . in this study, two cam family proteins  were phosphorylated ; however, the corresponding site has not been identified as a phosphorylation site in their respective arabidopsis counterparts, at1g <dig>  and at5g <dig> .

phosphoproteins involved in auxin responses and growth development related to dormancy
the auxin-sensitive dormancy-associated/auxin-repressed  gene is associated with bud dormancy  <cit> . in this study, one daar protein  showed three isoforms with respect to phosphorylation status, the three forms respectively phosphorylated at thr <dig>  thr <dig>  and thr <dig> . these corresponding sites have not been identified as phosphorylation sites in its homolog in arabidopsis, the daar protein . interestingly, the arabidopsis daar protein is phosphorylated at its conserved thr <dig> and thr <dig> residues  <cit> .

vernalization independence  <dig>  interacts with the flowering locus c-like mads-box protein  to activate flc, leading to inhibition of flower development  <cit> . they are key components in the regulatory pathway of cold-mediated bud dormancy induction and release  <cit> . in our study, we observed that poplar vip <dig>  was phosphorylated at ser <dig> ; the corresponding site in its arabidopsis homolog  is also known to be phosphorylated  <cit> . the mei2-like  genes, which play roles in plant meiosis and development  <cit> , were preferentially expressed in dormant buds of leafy spurge  <cit> . in this study, two phosphorylation sites were respectively identified on the n- and c- terminus of two isoforms of poplar mei2-like proteins , which are homologous to arabidopsis ml  . the corresponding site at the n-terminus in arabidopsis ml is known to be phosphorylated  <cit> , while the c-terminal phosphorylation site was novel.

phosphoproteins involved in dormancy-related cold stress response
dehydrins  are group ii , late embryogenesis abundant  proteins that accumulate in response to water deficit induced by drought, low temperature, or salinity  <cit> . certain dhns play a vital role in bud dormancy and cold acclimation of trees  <cit> . phosphorylation of their s-segment is required for targeting to the nucleus  <cit> . in this study, three dhn proteins were phosphorylated in regions outside of the s-segment, one  belongs to the kn type of dhns, one  belongs to the kns type of dhns, and the other  belongs to the skn type of dhns . heat shock proteins  function as molecular chaperones, and are induced by various environmental stress, such as cold, salinity, and oxidative stress  <cit> . recent data suggested that they are also involved in the process of bud dormancy  <cit> . a phosphorylation event on an hsp was identified in arabidopsis  <cit> . here, two hsp70s , one hsp <dig> , and one hsp <dig>  were phosphorylated in poplar .

phosphoprotein associated with dormancy-related flavonoid biosynthesis
many genes related to flavonoid biosynthesis are significantly regulated during the release of dormancy, such as acetyl-coa carboxylase , chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavonol synthase  <cit> . acetyl-coa carboxylase  catalyzes the formation of malonyl-coa, which is the substrate for biosynthesis of fatty acids and secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and anthocyanins  <cit> . in this work, one putative accase  was phosphorylated at ser <dig> and ser <dig> . there have been no reports of phosphorylation of its homolog in arabidopsis . interestingly, we also found another phosphorylation event related to flavonoid biosynthesis; polyphenol oxidase   was phosphorylated at ser <dig> . the poplar ppo has no counterparts in arabidopsis, but it shows homology to aureusidin synthase  in antirrhinum majus, a flavonoid synthase enzyme that catalyzes the formation of aurones from chalcones  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific phosphorylation site in a plant flavonoid synthase. the existence of this site suggests that phosphorylation may regulate its functions.

phosphoproteins involved in transport related to dormancy
the plasma membrane h+-atpase  is responsible for the transport of protons out of the cell through the membrane  <cit> . the aha gene is strongly expressed during dormancy transition, and contributes to changes in the plasma membrane  <cit> . the regulation of aha is controlled by phosphorylation of one thr residue in the well-conserved c-terminal domain  <cit> . in the aha family in arabidopsis, the well-conserved thr residue is phosphorylated in response to stress  <cit> . here, the exact thr site  in the c-terminus of poplar aha <dig> , and its corresponding site in aha <dig> of poplar  were both phosphorylated . another example of a transport protein is atp-binding cassette  transporters, which are integral membrane proteins that transport a wide variety of substrates, such as aba, auxin, and some plant secondary metabolites across cellular membranes  <cit> . genes encoding abc transporters are regulated during dormancy transition  <cit> , suggesting that they are linked with dormancy. here, two abc transporter family proteins  were phosphorylated at thr <dig> . the corresponding site is phosphorylated in its homologs in rice, arabidopsis, and medicago  <cit> .

phosphoproteins involved in protein synthesis related to dormancy
some genes and proteins involved in protein biosynthesis play a role in the mechanism of bud dormancy release  <cit> . phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins can affect protein synthesis by altering ribosome structure  <cit> . in the present work, six 60s acidic ribosomal proteins including p0-, p1-, p2-, and p3-types were phosphorylated close to their conserved c terminus, consistent with results reported elsewhere  <cit> . however, the pser at position  <dig> on the 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> of poplar  was novel . recent evidence suggests that phosphorylation of ser <dig> plays an important role in regulating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a  in plant cells  <cit> . here, four poplar eif5a proteins  were phosphorylated at their well-conserved serine residue and acetylated at their n-terminus . phosphorylation regulates the function and/or location of translation elongation factor 1a , which is involved in protein biosynthesis and signal transduction  <cit> . here, five eef1a isoforms  from poplar, all containing the phosphopeptide psvemhhealqealpgdnvgfnvk  were novel phosphoproteins .

phosphoproteins involved in electron transport or energy pathways
there are increases in expressions of some genes involved in energy pathways during bud release, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase   <cit> . here, three gapc isoforms  and three pepc isoforms  were phosphorylated . the light harvesting complex protein lhcb <dig>  which is essential for light electron transport, is significantly regulated during bud release  <cit> . reversible phosphorylation of lhcb <dig> is important for distributing absorbed light energy between the two photosystems  <cit> . as reported in other experiments on arabidopsis  <cit>  and spinach, lhcb <dig> proteins are phosphorylated at several thr and ser residues in their amino terminus  <cit> . here, we identified two previously unknown phosphorylation sites on the poplar lhcb <dig> protein; the conserved thr <dig> phosphosite and the unconserved thr <dig> phosphosite .

in summary, this information on phosphoproteins in dormant poplar provides a useful dataset, and provides new insights for exploring the relevance of phosphorylation for dormancy. however, further research, e.g., comparing proteomes between dormant/non-dormant tissues, is required to clarify the roles of phosphorylation in the dormancy process.

CONCLUSIONS
many physiological features of woody plants are not reflected in the herbaceous model arabidopsis or in rice. therefore, it is important to determine phosphorylation sites in poplar proteins, and to determine the roles of these phosphorylations in modifying protein function during growth and development. to date, there have been no extensive studies on the poplar phosphoproteome. in this work, we conducted a detailed analysis of the phosphoproteome of dormant poplar buds using an ms method and tio <dig> phosphopeptide-enrichment strategies. we found  <dig> unique phosphorylated sites in  <dig> phosphopeptides from  <dig> proteins, most of which are associated with binding and catalytic activity. most of the poplar phosphoproteins have orthologs in arabidopsis, suggesting that there are similar signaling pathways mediated by phosphorylation in poplar and arabidopsis. however, some phosphoproteins and phosphorylated sites were unique to poplar, thus confirming the need to obtain phosphoproteome data from poplar. several phosphorylation motifs were extracted from the dataset by motif-x. this could provide evidence for the involvement of kinases in phosphorylation of these identified proteins during dormancy in poplar. further experiments are now required to confirm that these specific kinases interact with the identified phosphoproteins in vivo. a promising way forward is to comprehensively characterize and analyze the dynamics of phosphorylation of poplar proteins in response to environmental changes, using specialized targeted quantitative proteomics tools.
