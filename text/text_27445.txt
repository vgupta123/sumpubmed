BACKGROUND
pigs, an important source of human food, accounting for over 40% of the meat produced worldwide. in addition, due to the similarities in anatomy and physiology with humans, they have been used in biomedicine as an important animal model for the study of the genetic basis of metabolic diseases such as obesity, type ii diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. as well it is often mentioned as the preferred animal species for organ xenotransplantation  <cit> .

over the last decade, a growing awareness of the association between diet and health has led nutritional quality to become a relevant factor in consumers’ food choices. a major development has been the recognition that certain fatty acids , such as oleic acid, and α-linolenic acid , can improve human health status and prevent disease  <cit> . production of meat with a fatty acids profile more in line with public health recommendations has the potential to improve long-term human health without requiring substantial changes in consumer habits. it is well known that the fatty acid meat composition of pigs is largely dependent on genotype, physiological status and environmental factors such as nutrition  <cit> .

the liver a highly specialized organ present in vertebrates and other animals regulates a wide variety of metabolic processes, which play a key role in the digestive function, the decomposition of red blood cells, hormone production and detoxification. together with adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, the liver is crucial in regulating lipid metabolism. in pigs, the liver is the primary site of de novo cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, whereas lipogenesis occurs essentially in liver and adipose tissues  <cit> .

in the last few years, new high-throughput technologies have been developed for the massive analysis of genomic data. these methodologies yield new opportunities to explore the genetic variability of populations, as well as the characterization of the transcriptome architectures. until the development of next-generation sequencing  technologies, most mrna expression studies have used microarray or quantitative pcr-based  approaches. the development of rna-seq, a method based on ngs which consisting of the direct sequencing of rna molecules present in a given sample, has provided a new tool for both transcriptome characterization and gene expression profiling. in rna-seq, the counts corresponding to each transcript can be used for quantification and these sequences can be mapped to the genome for their annotation. in comparison to microarrays, rna-seq provides a higher dynamic range, specificity and sensibility  <cit> . in addition, it provides a picture of the transcriptome, allowing the characterization of alternative splicing, variation in the usage of promoters and polyadenilation sites, non-coding rnas , single nucleotide variants  and transposable elements. furthermore, rna-seq data may allow the discovery of novel transcripts and long intergenic non-coding rnas   <cit> .

recent studies in livestock species have employed rna-seq to explore the transcriptome of animal products, such as cow milk  <cit> , bovine embryos  <cit> , and tissue as pig gonads  <cit> , liver, muscle, and abdominal fat  <cit> , sheep bone  <cit>  and bovine abomasal  <cit> . however, most of the rna-seq studies in pigs have included analysis of only a few animals, and ignored within group intrinsic variability. for instance, two single animals of different breeds were compared by esteve-codina et al.,  and three tissues in two phenotypically extreme full-sib f <dig> females formed the basis of chen et al.,  study.

the main goal of this study was the identification of differentially-expressed genes in the liver of groups of iberian x landrace crossbred pigs showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition using rna-seq. in addition, the porcine hepatic transcriptome was analyzed and transposable elements, new putative protein-coding genes and lncrnas were identified.

RESULTS
phenotypic variation between extreme groups
analyzed animals were a backcross  obtained by crossing three iberian  boars and  <dig> landrace sows. subsequently five f <dig> boards were backcrossed with  <dig> landrace sows. a principal component analysis  was performed to obtain the low-dimensional representation of the data and to describe the phenotypic variation of traits related to carcass quality and intramuscular fatty acid composition. the first two principal components explained the  <dig> % of the global phenotypic variance of these traits .

according to the score information for the first principal component the animals were ranked in two groups high  and low , of  <dig> individuals each. figure  <dig> shows two clusters of animals with the relative weight of all traits in the two first principal components. the first principal component grouped several traits related to the profile of fatty acids in longissimus dorsi  muscle. group l showed a higher proportion of saturated  and monounsaturated fatty acids , including palmitoleic and oleic acids. conversely, h group had a higher content of polyunsaturated acids  and related indices like the double bond index , the unsaturated index  and the peroxidability index . remarkably, h group also presented a higher proportion of essential pufa, like linolenic , ala, eicosadienoic , eicosatrienoic  and arachidonic  acids . these phenotypic differences are likely determined by genetic variability in: 1) absorption of la and ala acids; 2) elongation and desaturation of essential pufa to longer-chain ω− <dig> and ω− <dig> fatty acids; 3) de novo synthesis and metabolism of palmitoleic and oleic acids; and 4) transport deposition, storage or degradation and oxidation of all these fatty acids.

ns: p-value >  <dig> , * p-value <  <dig> , ** p-value <  <dig> , *** p-value <  <dig> .

previous studies have reported that, in both backfat and ld muscle, iberian pigs have higher percentages of palmitic acid, oleic acid, sfa and mufa, and lower concentrations of la and ala acids than commercial breeds  <cit> . moreover, pascual et al.,   <cit>  reported that landrace pigs have a higher content of la and aa acids in their muscle than other commercial breeds. in general, fatter pigs show higher proportions of sfa and mufa, but less pufa than lean pigs  <cit> . the genetic architecture of intramuscular fa composition in the iberian x landrace backcross was described in a genome-wide association study , showing  <dig> chromosomal intervals associated with these traits  <cit> . since all animals were raised and fed under the same standard management conditions, differences between h and l groups are probably caused by the segregation within the analyzed animals of iberian and landrace alleles.

phenotypic means between groups were compared and significant statistical differences in 73% of the analyzed traits was noted , mainly relating to intramuscular fatty acid composition . the maximum differences between groups were observed for the profiles of essential pufas . significant differences were also observed for pi and the percentage of palmitic, palmitoleic, heptadecenoic and heptadecanoic acids. from the  <dig> extreme animals,  <dig> females were selected for rna sequencing . pedigree information was used to select animals representing the parental genetic diversity. in addition, full-sibs within groups were avoided, animals within groups had different mothers, and four different fathers were selected per group. however, interesting familial relationships between animals of different groups were retained: there were two pairs of full-sibs and two pair of maternal half-sibs belonging to opposite groups. as before, the phenotypic means differed between groups. however, due to the reduced sample size, only sixteen traits showed significant differences .

mapping and annotation
the pig liver transcriptome of two groups  of phenotypically extreme females for intramuscular fatty acid composition was sequenced. after removal of sequencing adaptors and low-complexity reads, tophat software was employed  <cit>  to map the reads against the reference pig genome assembly sscrofa  <dig> . a total of  <dig>  m of  <dig> bp single-end reads  were obtained from two lanes of an illumina hi-seq  <dig> machine. observed percentages of mapped reads per individual were higher  than obtained previously in other porcine transcriptome studies;  <dig>  -  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit> . the number of reads and the mean percentages of mapped reads were equivalent for the h and l groups .

 <dig> l <dig> to l <dig> and h <dig> to h <dig> correspond to animals of the l and h groups, respectively.

 <dig> indicate millions of reads.

s-mart  <cit>  was used to calculate the proportion of reads mapping to exons, introns and 1kb upstream/downstream of the annotated genes. as expected, the highest percentage of reads mapped to exons , while  <dig>  –  <dig> % corresponded to introns and the lowest percentage was located either  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of the annotated genes  . the proportion of reads mapped to exons of annotated genes was in accordance with the study of chen et al.,  in three pig tissues , but was higher than that reported by esteve-codina et al.,  <dig>  in porcine male gonads. these differences  may be explained by the use of different versions of both the pig genome assembly and annotation, sscrofa <dig>  in the present study and sscrofa <dig>  in esteve-codina et al., . moreover, in the present study a newer version of tophat was used, which includes improvements in mapping. however, differences between tissues in the proportion of annotated genes cannot be ruled out.

 <dig> l <dig> to l <dig> and h <dig> to h <dig> correspond to animals of the l and h groups, respectively.

 <dig> reads located either  <dig> kb upstream or downstream of the annotated genes.

the total number of assembled transcripts with cufflinks was in agreement with the previously reported pig liver transcriptome  <cit> . these transcripts fall into the following categories: annotated exons , intron retention events , intergenic transcripts , potentially novel isoforms of genes , known isoforms , pre-mrna molecules  and polymerase run-on fragments  .

class codes described by cuffcompare: "=" exactly equal to the reference annotation, "c " contained in the reference annotation, "e" possible pre-mrna molecule, "i " an exon falling into an intron of the reference, "j " new isoforms, "o" unknown, generic overlap with reference, "p" possible polymerase run-on fragment, “s” an intron of the transfrag overlapping a reference intron on the opposite strand, "u" unknown, intergenic transcript, “x” exonic overlap with reference on the opposite strand. l <dig> to l <dig> and h <dig> to h <dig> correspond to animals of the l and h groups, respectively.

gene expression analysis
the total amount of expressed genes in liver was similar between groups . taking into account only those genes with a mean fpkm  higher than zero, an aggregate of  <dig>  expressed genes in l and  <dig>  in h groups was observed. a total of  <dig>  common genes were expressed in both groups. the correlation of mean gene expression levels between both groups  was very high , suggesting that the major fraction of the liver transcriptome is conserved between groups. gene expression distribution reveals that less than 10% of these genes were expressed between  <dig> –  <dig> fpkm; around 42% between  <dig> fpkm -  <dig> fpkm; 38% among  <dig> –  <dig> fpkm and, approximately, 8% more than  <dig> fpkm .

all  <dig> individuals were also assayed with the genechip® porcine microarray  which allows the expression analysis of  <dig>  sus scrofa genes. after probe normalization, correlation between the expression data of microarrays and rna-seq was calculated. in accordance with previous studies  <cit> , a strong spearman correlation  was observed . results from both technologies were, in general, more similar for genes that showed intermediate expression values, whereas major differences were observed for low and high expressed genes in the affymetrix microarray data. this pattern can be explained by the higher dynamic range of rna-seq  <cit> . finally, in line with the previous description of liver transcriptome  <cit> , the top  <dig> expressed genes showed an overrepresentation in biological gene ontologies related to oxidoreductase activity, transport, proteolysis, translation, signal transduction, cholesterol homeostasis and lipid transport .

transposable elements analysis
the percentage of repetitive elements identified in the pig liver transcriptome was around <dig>  –  <dig> % , similar to that found in male gonad transcriptome   <cit> . however, it should be noted that the total length of base pairs masked and the total number of transcripts were higher in male gonad transcriptome  <cit>  than in our study. two possible explanations may account for these differences: 1) in liver from  <dig>  –  <dig>  m of single-end reads per individual were obtained , whereas in gonads  <cit>  a total of  <dig> m paired-end reads were observed and, thus, a better fragment distribution and a higher number of transcripts were analysed; 2) the transcriptome complexity has been reported  <cit>  to be higher in kidney, testes and brain tissues in comparison to liver and muscle.

gene orthology and lncrnas detection
from the unannotate  intergenic expressed regions, a range of 3488– <dig> intergenic novel transcripts were identified in each sample . however, to find not annotated genes, transcripts expressed in at least four of the five animals of each group were considered. then, augustus software  <cit>  was used to examine which of these transcripts were predicted to encode proteins. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> putative proteins were identified for the l and h groups, respectively . according to blastp results, these proteins correspond for l group to:  <dig> novel computationally predicted and  <dig> known human proteins,  <dig> novel and  <dig> known bovine proteins and  <dig> novel and  <dig> know-porcine proteins. similarly, for the h group predicted proteins correspond to:  <dig> novel computationally predicted and  <dig> known human proteins,  <dig> novel and  <dig> known bovine proteins and  <dig> novel and  <dig> known porcine proteins. interestingly, in both h and l groups, around 86% of the predicted novel proteins were found in the sus scrofa protein database ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-65/fasta/sus_scrofa/pep/ as novel computationally predicted proteins. moreover, the number of matches increased to 58%  when the predicted novel proteins were compared against the putative coding transcripts reported by esteve-codina et al., . this result indicates that a high number of genes are not annotated in the sscrofa  <dig>  pig genome assembly and they are expressed in both liver and gonad tissues. finally, these results constitute an experimental confirmation of the novel computationally predicted genes in pigs.

predicted proteins reported in pigs by esteve-codina et al.,  are also included.

for lncrnas annotation, the previously reported sequences in pig male gonad transcriptome  <cit>  were used as a reference database. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  of these putative lncrnas was also expressed in pig liver. within groups,  <dig> and  <dig> lncrnas were expressed in all l and h animals, respectively, but only  <dig> lncrnas were expressed in both groups .

differential gene expression analysis
deseq software  <cit>  was employed to detect differentially-expressed  genes between h and l groups. first, some exploratory analyses to estimate the variance and quality of the data were performed. per-gene estimates of the base variance against the base levels showed that the fit  closely followed the single-gene estimates . the 'residualsecdfplot' function, which checks the uniformity of the cumulative probabilities, revealed a similar pattern for the curves of the empirical cumulative density functions  in both groups . it was also noted that ecdf followed well the diagonal, except for very low counts, but that is to be expected because at this level shot noise dominates and, therefore, the deviations become stronger . afterwards de analysis between groups was performed. figure  <dig> shows that, at selected cut-off > <dig>  or q-value ≤  <dig> ), there is a clear departure from expected among transcripts accepted as differentially expressed . therefore according to the employed cut-off ,  <dig> protein-coding genes, two pseudogenes  and one non-coding rna  were identified as differentially-expressed .

in order to validate the expression data obtained by rna-seq, five genes  were selected among the differentially-expressed protein-coding genes to perform real time reverse transcription  assays. when the pattern of gene expression levels was compared, strong correlations ranking from  <dig>  to  <dig>  between rt-qpcr and rna-seq platforms were observed, confirming the high reproducibility of the data .

interestingly, one of the studied genes, the cyp2c <dig>  which belongs to the highly diverse superfamily of cyp <dig>  <cit>  and it is homologue to the human cyp2c <dig> gene, was located in a genomic region in which copy number variation  has been previously described in pigs  <cit> . in order to assess whether observed differences of gene expression were influenced by differences in the cnv between animals, a real time quantitative pcr  to determine the number of copies of the cyp2c <dig> gene was developed. for the first time, cnv affecting the cyp2c <dig> gene was described with relative quantification values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  copies . however, no correlation between the number of copies and gene expression was observed. therefore, further analysis will be necessary to elucidate the possible role of these structural variants in the fatty acid metabolism.

moreover, it is noteworthy that six of the differentially-expressed genes related to fatty acids metabolism in liver  were previously reported as associated with the profile of intramuscular fatty acid composition in a gwas study in the same animal population  <cit> . therefore, they can be considered as interesting candidate genes and this suggest their role in the fatty acid metabolism processes in pigs in both liver and imf tissues .

 <dig> the genomic coordinates are expressed in bp and are relative to the sus scrofa april  <dig> genome sequence assembly .

functional clustering of differentially-expressed genes in the liver
from the  <dig> differentially-expressed protein-coding genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in h group in comparison to l . to gain insight into the liver tissue processes that differed between groups, the list of the differentially-expressed genes was explored using the core analysis function included in ingenuity pathways analysis . initially, the pig gene ids were converted to human genes but five protein-coding genes did not match with human homologs , and therefore only  <dig> pig genes were eligible for network construction.

the top seven biological functions identified by ipa included categories related to a wide variety of physiological and biological events, such as lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, molecular transport, drug metabolism, energy production, nucleic acid metabolism, and vitamin and mineral metabolism . a specific examination of the lipid metabolism ipa molecular and cellular function revealed that most of the transcripts relating to lipid metabolism were up-regulated in h group compared to l group. remarkably, genes that play a crucial role in lipoprotein synthesis , cholesterol metabolism , oxidation of lipids and palmitic fatty acids , and induction of lipogenic gene transcription  were up-regulated in h group in contrast to l group. on the contrary, genes involved with accumulation of triacylglycerol , uptake of lipids and myristic acid , and fatty acids biosynthesis  were down-regulated in h group as opposed to l group. the malic enzyme is involved in supplying nadph for the reductive biosynthesis of fatty acids  <cit> . based on the above observations it is tempting to speculate that ala and la acids reaching liver tissue inhibit the expression of me <dig> gene, and consequently, at least partially, reduce lipogenic activity. this is in agreement with guillevic et al.  <cit> , who reported that ala acid enriched diets decreased malic enzyme activity in liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue of pigs.

statistical significance of pathway modulation was calculated via a right-tailed fisher’s exact test in ingenuity pathway and represented as –log : -log values exceeding  <dig>  were significant false discovery rate  <  <dig> .

interestingly, the most representative canonical pathways significantly modulated in liver when comparing h vs l groups were involved in endotoxin lipopolysaccharide / pro-inflammatory cytokines  mediated inhibition of retinoid x receptors  function, fatty acid metabolism  and pregnane x receptor / farnesoid x receptor  activation , in which the up-regulation of abcg <dig>  apob and cyp7a <dig> genes was observed. likewise, the present findings underscore that h group increased the expression of gene sets regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha   and rxr  transcription factors, both of which are shown to have an important role in lipid homeostasis. for instance, ppar-α is an important regulator of cellular fatty acid uptake and intracellular fatty acid transport, mitochondrial and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis in several species  <cit> , whereas rxr plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of a spectrum of genes controlling cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid homeostasis, together with nuclear receptor fxr, a key transcription factor that regulates cholesterol  <dig> α-hydroxylase  activity and mrna levels.

statistical significance of pathway modulation was calculated via a right-tailed fisher’s exact test in ingenuity pathway analysis and represented as –log : -log values exceeding  <dig>  were significant fdr < <dig> .

in addition, the up-regulation of ppar-α and rxr were coupled with the increased expression of lipin  and cyp7a <dig> genes. in mice, it has been reported that lpin <dig> selectively activates a subset of coactivator 1α  target pathways involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, while suppressing the lipogenic program and lowering circulating lipid levels  <cit> . lipin activates mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative metabolism by inducing expression of the nuclear receptor ppar-α, a known pgc-1α target, and via direct physical interactions with ppar-α and pgc-1α. furthermore, cyp7a <dig> has been shown to be a key factor of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. all together these results suggest that h group may present greater uptake of fatty acids into hepatocytes . it is likely that the higher pufa bioavailability in liver may affect expression of ppar-α, rxr and their target genes, inducing a greater stimulation of both peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation, and leading to reduced triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis, and an enhanced elimination of cholesterol from the liver via bile acid formation. this intriguing possibility remains to be demonstrated, although there is evidence that fa, in particular unsaturated fa, exert many of their biological effects by regulating the activity of numerous transcription factors in liver, such as ppar-α  <cit> . recently,  <cit>  has demonstrated that fa oxidation is regulated by hepatic mufa to pufa ratio through the activation of ppar-α. in agreement to our results, hepatic expression of ppar-α was higher in pigs fed with a higher level of pufa. this is also in line with the lower imf content in h group than in l animals, and the lower proportion of de novo fatty acids in the imf. therefore, these transcriptome changes may reflect counter mechanisms of liver tissue to respond or compensate for changes in imf fatty acid profile, which depends on possible metabolisation of fas and the possibility of being synthesized by the pig adipose tissue  <cit> . however, the question remains how different types of fa control the expression of genes and a direct examination of the effect of each individual fa on porcine muscle fatty acid composition is needed.

finally, the identified genes were mapped to three genetic networks. the first, having an ipa network score of  <dig> and  <dig> focus genes, presented functions related to lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and vitamin and mineral metabolism . the second, with a score of  <dig> and  <dig> focus genes centred on lipid metabolism, molecular transport and small molecule biochemistry , and the third network scoring  <dig> and  <dig> focus genes was associated with carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and molecular transport . when the top three ipa networks were merged a connection between them was observed , suggesting that the differentially-expressed genes detected in this study are linked and play an important role in lipid metabolism. remarkably, ipa results are in conformity with the design of this experiment, which inferred that la and aa acids metabolism were altered between the groups of sequenced individuals.

implications
in the present study, rna-seq was used for the analysis of the pig liver transcriptome in animals of extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition.

the liver plays an important role in lipid metabolism and, thus, the analysis of liver transcriptome in extreme pigs for intramuscular fatty acid composition may be relevant to elucidate its functional complexity. although the main goal of this study was to find differentially-expressed genes between phenotypically extreme animals, the use of rna-seq allowed the identification of transposable elements, lncrnas and new protein-coding genes in the porcine liver transcriptome.

the first principal component of pca analysis classified animals in two extreme groups for the fatty acid composition of ld muscle. group h of animals had a higher content of pufa, including essential fa such as la, ala, ele and aa acids than group l animals. conversely, the latter had a higher content of sfa and mufa, palmitoleic and oleic acids.

the lipid content and fatty acid profile of muscle plays an important role in the tenderness, flavour and juiciness of cooked meat  <cit> . in swine production, the reduction of intramuscular fat  in some breeds due to a preference selection for lean pigs, has affected meat quality. from this point of view, pufa has a negative effect on the oxidative stability of muscle, which, in turn, affects flavour and muscle colour  <cit> . on the other hand, desirable sensorial characteristics tend to be associated with mufa and sfa  <cit> . lipid and fatty acid compositions of food have an important impact on human health, with a high consumption of sfa associated with obesity, high plasma cholesterol and cardiovascular disease  <cit> . conversely, pufas, mainly ω− <dig>  have been considered beneficial for human health, by reducing serum low-density lipoprotein-c, total cholesterol concentration and modulating immune functions and inflammatory processes  <cit> .

there is increasing awareness of the wide range of health benefits of pufa in general, and of ω− <dig> fatty acids in particular. meat is an important basis of human nutrition, and pork meat is seen to be a major source of human food. the composition of fatty acids stored in adipose tissue in pigs largely reflects that of ingested lipids  <cit> . thus, swine meat enriched with ω− <dig> fatty acids can be achieved by feeding with commercial diets supplemented with this pufa  <cit> , and possibly by selective breeding. in fact, there is a genetic basis of pufa level in pork meat. it is likely that h group presented higher absorption of essential pufa, increasing their amount reaching the imf tissue, which in turn could be considered as an important factor in the inhibition of the de novo saturated fatty acid proportion in meat. furthermore, differences on elongation, desaturation and oxidation of those essential pufa to longer-chain ω− <dig> and ω− <dig> fatty acids cannot be discarded. therefore, from the human health perspective, increasing h genotypes through breeding programs could be desirable because meat and meat-derived foods are still large contributors to saturated fatty acids intake in humans. these observations, together with several gene expression effects are the major factors leading us to believe that genetic was indeed a significant factor affecting meat imf pufa content and composition. however, an inverse relationship exists between nutritional value and eating quality of meat and, as consequence, established selection criteria to all together improve meat quality from the sensorial and nutritional point of view is a complex matter. therefore, a holistic approach including both nutrigenetic and nutrigenomic disciplines may be required to improve the pork meat quality from both points of view.

CONCLUSIONS
we used rna-seq as a tool to explore the liver transcriptome of ten female pigs with extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition. transposable elements, lncrnas and new putative protein-coding genes were identified. reproducibility of the data was confirmed by the strong correlation observed between the values of gene expression obtained by rna-seq, rt-qpcr and microarrays. a total of  <dig> genes differentially-expressed between extreme animals were identified. these genes belong to canonical pathways and gene networks related to the lipid and fatty acid metabolism. in concordance with the initial phenotypic classification, pathway analysis inferred that linolenic and arachidonic acid metabolism was altered between extreme animals. the results obtained may help in the design of new selection strategies to improve pork meat quality from both the sensorial and nutritional points of view.
