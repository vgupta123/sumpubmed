BACKGROUND
multiple protein sequence comparison can provide a valuable protein signature and, thus, contribute to the fields of structural biology and molecular evolution  <cit> . in general, sequence similarity identified by multiple sequence alignment  among a set of query sequences suggests similar function among the proteins  <cit> . these signatures can be readily obtained by web-based tools, such as blast  <cit> , clustalw  <cit> , or musca  <cit>  systems. however, although the default parameters in most programs give satisfactory results, in some cases special variables need to be taken into consideration. for example, the allocation of major variations among a few query sequences can be achieved from the results of direct msa, whereas the uniqueness of each sequence that is not well-aligned is difficult to reveal. it is also quite expensive and time-consuming to experimentally search for such unique peptide motifs  that may involve the key biological functions of interest. therefore, the need for effective and efficient identification of the upms located in a number of query proteins by novel bioinformatic tools is urgent. we have thus developed a reinforced merging algorithm  to rapidly identify the non-gapped upms for each member of a protein family.

in our study, the highly conserved human ribonuclease a  superfamily was initially tested to define the default input parameters. the rnasea superfamily is composed of eight rnases including rnase <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with similar sequences and biological functions  <cit> . a pairwise comparison between rnasea sequences shows more than 29% similarity; especially for rnase <dig> v.s. rnase <dig> and rnase <dig> v.s. rnase <dig>  which have as high as  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities, respectively. molecular evolutionary analysis revealed that both gene pairs emerged as a result of a relatively recent gene duplication event  <cit> . in addition to the rnasea superfamily, other protein families with larger molecular weights including the members of epidermal growth factor receptor , matrix metalloproteinase , and sma-and-mad related protein  family with respectively an average molecular weight of  <dig> kd,  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd were analyzed.

a monoclonal antibody  is commonly used in biological experiments for distinguishing the sequence specificity, quantity variation, and cellular localization of each member of the human protein families  <cit> . generally, the epitope is composed of a charged and hydrophilic peptide of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids exposed at the structural surface of the protein  <cit> . in this study, we generated one mab specifically against rnase <dig> and the mapping experiments revealed that the epitope was indeed located at a unique region in rnase <dig> identified by rma. further analysis of several mabs and polyclonal abs against human rnasea, egfr, and mmp families demonstrated that they all recognized specific epitopes corresponding to the upms identified by rma. we also mapped the upms on the resolved 3-d structures of the proteins and found that most of the upms were located on loop regions and exposed to the structural surfaces. furthermore, the analytic comparison between rma and protean  <cit> , a commercially available software for prediction of antigenic regions, revealed that most of the upms identified by rma matched well with the antigenic regions predicted by protean.

RESULTS
identification of the upms in the human rnasea superfamily by rma
the eight sequences of mature human rnaseas were entered to rma for analysis. as shown in figure 1a, thirty upms of four to sixteen amino acid residues are identified and presented in blue. the orange characters at both ends of a upm represent the trimmed residues in the trimming operators. the ones located between two blue sequence stretches reveal that the adjacent upms are not sequential.

only one upm could be identified in each of the most conservative rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  which is consistent with the phylogenetic analysis results of the human rnasea superfamily, strongly suggesting a close relationship between rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  <cit> . in addition, four and six upms were respectively found in rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  another highly conservative rnase pair. likewise, in rnase <dig>  rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  three to four upms could be located. interestingly, as many as seven short upms were identified in rnase <dig>  twenty-five upms located on the 3-d structures of rnase <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were labeled in blue , and the loop coverage of each upm was calculated . it was found that fifteen upms were located at loop regions in the 3-d structures of rnase <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with loop coverage greater than 50%.

it should be noticed that the key enzymatic active site residues correspondent to his <dig>  lys <dig> and his <dig> of mature rnase <dig> have been found to be located in the well-conserved regions among all eight rnases , indicating that rma is practical in distinguishing the upms from the conserved sequences in a protein family. the upm p116-y <dig> located in the last loop of the c-terminus of rnase <dig> has been determined as the epitope for a polyclonal ab, d112-p <dig> ab, which specifically recognized rnase <dig> and was generated by boix  <cit> . the upm p64-f <dig> in rnase <dig> was located within a sheet-turn-sheet conformation involved in the protein-cell interaction   <cit> .

application of rma on protein families with larger molecular weight
we have further examined the application of rma on more protein families. the complete protein sequences of four members of human egfr family erbb, erbb <dig>  erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> were analyzed by rma, and forty upms were identified. fourteen upms located within the resolved 3-d structures at the n-terminal extracellular domains of approximately  <dig> residues in erbb, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> were labeled in blue . in erbb, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig>  six, six and two upms of six to thirteen residues in length were identified, respectively. nine upms were found to possess loop coverage higher than 50% . a upm s350-i <dig> in domain iii  of the extracellular domain in erbb was also identified as an egf binding site for transduction of the erbb signaling  <cit> . another upm in erbb <dig>  h42-q <dig>  matched nicely within the epitope of the anti-erbb <dig> n-term polyclonal ab , an antibody that specifically distinguishes erbb <dig> from the other members of the egfr family .

the sequences of mature human mmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are categorized as members of the same subfamily and contain approximately  <dig> amino acids, were analyzed by rma and forty five upms were identified. the results shown in table  <dig> revealed that nine and six upms of five to ten residues in length were identified in mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  respectively. currently only the structure of one of the catalytic domains  of mmp <dig> was determined in which two upms, q103-t <dig> and t145-r <dig>  could be identified by rma. the former matched nicely with loop  <dig> and the latter matched well with loop  <dig> in the mmp <dig> structure  <cit> . the upm r273-i <dig> of mmp <dig> overlapped with the epitope for a mab αmmp <dig>   . likewise, a upm k218-p <dig> of mmp <dig> matched perfectly with the characterized epitope for another mab αmmp <dig>   . in addition, the enzymatic active sites of mmps in the highly conserved motif ddxxgixxxyg   <cit>  and gln <dig>  <cit>  numbered correspondent to mmp <dig> were characterized to be located within the conserved regions, consistent with the results for the human rnasea superfamily .

eight human smads were analyzed by rma and twenty four upms were identified. currently only the c-terminal structures of approximately  <dig> residues of smad <dig>  smad <dig> and smad <dig> are available. since the identified upms in smad <dig> and smad <dig> were located in the regions with unresolved structures, only the upms identified in smad <dig> were shown in table  <dig>  the upm g510-i <dig> was completely located in the l <dig> loop responsible for the binding with ski protein, an oncoprotein that represses the tgf-β signaling. another upm e538-l <dig> with 64% of loop coverage in the last loop within the mh <dig> domain in the c-terminus of smad <dig> was responsible for the interaction with the tgf-β receptors  <cit> . in the smad superfamily, smad <dig> plays a central role as it is the shared hetero-oligomerization partner of other smads and it possesses the dna binding ability for regulation of gene expression  <cit> . within the dna binding domain of smad <dig>  k45-k <dig>  only one upm t62-h <dig> was identified by rma  <cit> .

doks are phospho-proteins in the downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. six members of human dok family, dok <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of approximately  <dig> amino acids were analyzed by rma and forty four upms were identified. a upm y402-g <dig> located at the c-terminus was found to be residing within the recognition site of an antibody αdok <dig>  ; hence it is expected that αdok <dig> can be used to distinguish dok <dig> from the other doks . another protein family containing human carboxypeptidase d , e , m , n  was also analyzed. one of the upms in cpe matched well with the epitope for an anti-cpe mab . the analyses of egfr, mmp, smad, dok, and cp families demonstrated that for members of protein families with large molecular weights, rma still performed quite efficiently to provide useful structural and functional information.

application of rma on homologous proteins from different species
the sequence comparison of homologous proteins among different species provides information on molecular and functional evolution. in this study, hrnase <dig> and its bovine homologue bprnasea were analyzed by rma. the result shown in table  <dig> revealed that six upms of six to eight residues in length were identified in each sequence. ten out of the twelve identified upms were included in the loops, indicating that the loop regions in these two rnases were quite distinguishable. in addition, a upm k31-d <dig> in bprnasea was included in the recognition site  of a polyclonal antibody α rnasea generated by younus and colleagues  <cit> .

msba is a 630-amino acid prokaryotic homologue of human multidrug resistant protein. five prokaryotic msbas from e. coli, v. cholera, g. violaceus, s. oneidensis, and b. japonicum were analyzed by rma and fifty two upms were identified. among which thirteen upms of five to seven residues identified by rma in e. coli and v. cholera msbas were shown in table  <dig>  according to the 3-d structures of msbas of e. coli  <cit>  and v. cholera  <cit> , five of the identified upms were completely located in the loop regions and 67%–83% residues of two upms were covered by the loops. as a result, rma has been demonstrated to be useful in analysis of homologous proteins among several species to rapidly identify the unique signatures of each query sequence.

specificity of mabs against human rnase <dig> and rnase3
one mab against rnase <dig> named as 3c <dig> was successfully generated and purified. the specificity of mab 3c <dig> and αrnase <dig>  a commercially available mab against rnase <dig>  was further investigated. bovine rnasea  and bacterial extracts containing recombinant human rnase <dig> , rnase <dig> , rnase <dig> , mbp-rnase <dig> , rnase3-gfp , and gfp were separated by 15% sds/page and stained by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> . the proteins were transferred onto a pvdf membrane and probed separately by mab 3c <dig> and αrnase <dig> . our results demonstrated that mab 3c <dig> could specifically recognize rnase <dig> and rnase3-gfp but did not cross-react with any other rnases or the expression tags . similarly, the αrnase <dig> only probed the recombinant rnase <dig> rather than the other rnases .

epitope screening for mab 3c <dig> and αrnase2
to further identify the epitopes residing on rnase <dig> and correlate the experimental data with the identification by rma, the mature and several truncated rnase <dig> were fused to gfp tags to efficiently express recombinant proteins including rnase3-gfp , rnase31–113-gfp , rnase31–73-gfp , rnase324–133-gfp , rnase324–93-gfp , rnase324–73-gfp , rnase351–73-gfp , and rnase374–133-gfp . upon induction with iptg, these proteins were expressed and recognized by αhis as a positive control . after immunoblotting with mab 3c <dig>  all recombinant proteins except the last one were specifically recognized, suggesting that the epitope for mab 3c <dig> was located in the overlapping region within rnase351– <dig> , a region that is possibly the most distinguishable between rnase <dig> and rnase <dig> 

according to the identification by rma, residues  <dig> to  <dig> of rnase <dig> were identical to those of rnase2; hence this region was further deleted to generate a recombinant rnase358–73-gfp  protein. as expected, figure 4b clearly showed that such a recombinant protein was probed by both αhis and mab 3c <dig>  indicating that the epitope for mab 3c <dig> was indeed located within rnase358– <dig>  consistent with the identification by rma .

the epitope for αrnase <dig> was not indicated in either its manufacture or other reports. to allocate the epitope region experimentally, three clones containing chimeric rnase3/rnase <dig> were generated to express the chimeric proteins in e. coli . the chimeric junctions contain three separate regions where the residues are identical between rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  immunoblotting analysis revealed that only chimera a was recognized by αrnase <dig>  indicating that p58–p <dig> of rnase <dig> was quite important in determining the antigenicity . based on the rma and experimental results, two recombinant clones rnase258–73-gfp  and rnase273–90-gfp  were further generated. the results showed that the former was not probed by αrnase <dig>  whereas the latter was specifically recognized . since only five continuous residues in rnase273–90-gfp were predicted to be unique by rma, the recombinant rnase273–77-gfp  protein was further expressed and tested. our result demonstrated evidently that a segment as short as only five residues of rnase <dig> were detected by αrnase <dig>  indicating that the epitope for αrnase <dig> was successfully narrowed down to "h73sgsq77" .

comparison of rma and protean
protean is commonly used for analysis of potential antigenic regions in the primary sequence of individual protein based on mainly the hydrophilicity of the query sequence  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the comparison between the performance of our rma and protean. it was found that the epitopes of αrnase <dig>  mab 3c <dig> and d112-p <dig> ab could be identified and predicted by both methods, and the experimental data further provided direct evidence of such correlation. in addition, the peptides "m60tcpsnktr68" in rnase <dig> and "n19pprc23" and "y98adrpg103" in rnase <dig> identified by rma also appeared to have high potential to serve as specific and antigenic peptide antigens. the merit of rma lies in its ability to provide additional information for rapid identification in silico of such antigenic peptides with high specificity.

performance analysis of rma
since no specialized database for the epitopes of mabs against human proteins is currently available, the related information was retrieved from the website of santa cruz biotechnology, inc. which focused on the ongoing development of research antibodies  <cit> . of  <dig> items in the database, only  <dig> mabs were derived from antigens classified into  <dig> human protein families containing  <dig> sequences. based on the criteria described in the "methods" section, each set of the family protein sequences was collected from genbank and analyzed by rma. it was found that  <dig> upms could be located within the recognition sites of  <dig> mabs. thus, the accuracy of matching at least one of the upms with the epitopes of the  <dig> selected mabs in this case was calculated to be  <dig> % . figure  <dig> showed that as the lengths of the epitopes of the selected mabs decreased from  <dig>   <dig>  to  <dig> amino acid residues, the accuracy of a upm being correlated with an epitope decreased from  <dig> %,  <dig> %, to  <dig> %, respectively. although the accuracy was length-dependent, an accuracy of higher than 70% could still be achieved.

discussion
we have demonstrated that rma can identify upms in a number of protein families during multiple sequence comparison. twenty-six sequences in four human protein families have been analyzed as shown in table  <dig>  in comparison with the 3-d structures of rnase <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  about 72% of the upms in the human rnasea superfamily  was located in the loop regions of the structural surfaces. as for the biological functions of the upms, p64-f <dig> in rnase <dig> has been previously reported to be involved in the protein-cell interaction  <cit>  and angiogenesis  <cit> . it should be noticed that in eight members of human rnasea superfamily, only rnase <dig> possesses such angiogenetic activity, indicating that the uniqueness of p64-f <dig> correlates well with a specific function. in addition, the loop areas are known to possess the most flexible conformation and the residue compositions in loops are usually quite variable. many peptides in the loop area have been reported to involve in molecular recognition by serving as the protein-protein interaction domains  <cit> , enzyme-substrate binding sites  <cit> , hormone binding motifs  <cit> , or dna binding motifs  <cit> . in our case, rma successfully picked up the most characteristic features of these peptides among several protein families. since the flexible conformation and variable residue composition in a loop region may provide additional specificity for recognition of abs, identification of upms may further aid in epitope mapping as well as peptide antigen design.

in this study, we reported the analysis of three large protein families including egfr, mmp, and smad with respectively 39%-52%, 46%-78%, and 20%-92% pairwise sequence identity to test the practical application of rma. the upms in the extracelluar domains of four members in egfr family were subsequently analyzed. unlike rnases, the extracellular domains in erbb, erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> showed quite different conformations. in this particular data set, we found that 71% of the upms in egfr family were located in the loops . the upm s350-k <dig> located within domain iii  has been identified as an egf binding domain on the extracellular domain of erbb, the only member of the egfr family that egf recognizes   <cit> . combined with the structural features of human rnase and egfr families, the upms provided additional information of many loops in the proteins with resolved structures. thus, for the proteins without 3-d structural information, it is speculated that the upms may also be located in the loops to a considerable extent. nevertheless, the possibility of a upm being located in the well-defined α-helical or β-sheet structures cannot be excluded. as for the mmp superfamily, more than twenty members are currently classified, and several subfamilies are identified according to their domain compositions. it was thus necessary to classify the members of such a big protein family to several subgroups prior to rma analysis. accordingly, we have correlated two identified upms in mmp <dig> with the loop structures.

the experimental epitope mapping results suggest that some of the upms can serve as potential candidates to generate specific abs to distinguish the highly conservative sequences in a protein family. in the past, sequential antigenic regions were determined based on the protrusion index, accessibility, mobility, charged amino acids or hydrophilic regions at the protein surface  <cit> . however, a good antigenic region may not specifically distinguish one protein from the other members in the same protein family. our rma has been demonstrated to efficiently discriminate the accumulation of unique features of a peptide fragment to distinguish different regions in a protein family. although eight members of human rnasea superfamily share high similarity, identification by rma has given thirty upms of four to sixteen amino acids in length, among which at least three were demonstrated to serve as epitopes for αrnase <dig>  mab 3c <dig> and d112-p <dig> ab . in our case, theoretically  <dig> upms of eight residues in length in the human rnasea superfamily can be identified. therefore, rma techniques have at least increased the probability of finding a upm in rnasea superfamily from 1/ <dig> to 1/ <dig>  likewise, the probability of finding such upms in human egfr, mmp, and smad families can be raised from 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  and 1/ <dig> up to 1/ <dig>  1/ <dig>  and 1/ <dig>  respectively. in erbb <dig>  a upm h42-q <dig> was located within the epitope of αerbb <dig> n-term  at the first α-helix in domain i   <cit> . this ab can recognize the structural surface of the well-folded extracellular domain. in addition, both αmmp <dig> and αmmp <dig> can probe denatured and well-folded proteins. although 3-d structures containing the epitopes for αmmp <dig> and αmmp <dig> are not resolved yet, it is speculated that these regions are also exposed at the surfaces.

as for cross species protein analysis, the identity between bprnasea and hrnase <dig> was  <dig> %. in these two highly conservative homologues, six identified upms of each rnase were localized in the corresponding positions in their primary sequences. structurally,  <dig> % of these regions were included in the loop areas of the resolved 3-d structures of bprnasea and hrnase <dig>  interestingly, except the first upm, the loop coverage values of the second to the sixth upms in bprnasea are nearly the same as those of hrnase <dig> , indicating that the loop areas of these two proteins are the most distinguishable. similarly, the analysis of msbas by rma revealed that the majority of the identified upms were located in the loop areas. hence, rma has been demonstrated to be useful to analyze homologous proteins from different species in addition to different proteins in one family in a particular species. the analysis of homologous proteins among different species may reveal the residue variation during molecular evolution. to our knowledge, it occurs sometimes that an antibody was not successfully produced as expected by injecting the immunized animals with a designed peptide or protein, probably due to lack of the uniqueness in the antigenic sequence  <cit> . our rma can identify the upms that do not exist in the homologous protein in the immunized animals; hence it can be used to provide an initial screening for potential epitope design to raise the probability of obtaining polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides.

in comparison with other motif-finding methods, meme  system can discover the motifs with highly conserved regions in a group of related protein sequences. it represents motifs as position-dependent letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each possible letter at each position in the pattern  <cit> . mast  can search the biological sequence databases for sequences that contain one or more known motifs which are represented as position-dependent scoring matrices that describe the score of each possible letter at each position in the pattern  <cit> . the masia algorithm recognizes the common patterns and properties in multiple aligned protein sequences. it converts a sequence to a properties matrix that can be scanned in both vertical and horizontal steps. consistent patterns are recognized based on the statistical significance of their occurrence  <cit> . prosite is a document database which collected a large number of biologically meaningful motifs that described as patterns or profile  <cit> . the main characteristics of these four sequence prediction algorithms are determination of the motifs with similar features. we have specifically analyzed the eight human rnase a sequences using prosite. it was found that the biological motifs such as potential phosphorylation sites and glycosylation sites identified by prosite were actually located within the conservative regions, none of them was identified as a upm by rma analysis. we have also matched all the biological motifs or pattern matrices in the prosite database with the proteins in pdb database. it was found that  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the prosite patterns were located at the α-helix, β-sheet, turn, and undetermined regions, respectively. unlike the rma results, only a few prosite patterns were located at the loops. our rma reinforces the non-conserved patterns and extracts the motifs with more than  <dig> residues. these upms are demonstrated to be correlated well with the loops exposed on the structural surface, or regions that are known to be able to serve as molecular recognition sites. it is conceivable that such unique sequence-dependent functional characteristics may be detected by our method, although the novel functional properties still remain to be explored. evolutionally, the random unique sequence pieces are expected to be evenly distributed or randomly scattered in the entire protein sequences by statistical estimation. they are not specifically located in the loops. if a particular random mutation occurs in a position that is crucial for maintaining the structure integrity or catalytic function of a protein family, either the preservation of the mutation during evolution is disfavoured, or a dysfunctional protein would be generated to cause disease. on the contrary, the upms identified by our method are evolutionarily preserved sequence motifs, hence apart from the conserved regions; the upms tend to be located in loops and may be correlated with different functions of members in a protein family.

rma is proved to be useful for finding characteristic sequence motifs in highly conservative members of one protein family. the upms may have the potential to be used as minivaccines for protecting animals from pathogenic infections. in general, the peptide-induced anti-peptide ab must specifically recognize the desired infectious pathogen, but not cross-react to others. the upms identified by rma  can be directly compared with the antigenic regions predicted by protean , such that the most specific and antigenic peptide antigen may be allocated . in a large-scale analysis on mabs with known epitopes on members of human protein families, rma demonstrated higher than 70% accuracy in terms of correlating upms with epitopes of mabs . recently, ecale zhou et al. developed computational approaches employing a combination of structure- and sequence-based alignments for identification of the antibody/protein binding pockets on the surface of ricin a chain  <cit> . structure alignment software and modified pocket-finding algorithm were required for extracting the residue-residue correspondence as well as for the determination of the conserved or unique binding pocket in the target molecules. unlike the aforementioned method, our rma directly identified and merged the non-gapped primary unique patterns; neither msa nor structural information was prerequisite prior to the operation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, we have developed a bioinformatic tool to facilitate identification of upms located mostly in the loops or on the surface in members of a protein family. the structural features of some peptides are correlated with molecular recognition including antigen-antibody, protein-protein, protein-ligand and protein-cell interactions. our method provides an effective and efficient evaluation of sequence, structural and functional studies that allow biologists to examine their protein sequences of interest prior to experiments such as peptide antigen design and mutagenesis.
