BACKGROUND
chromosomal imbalance has been recognized as the most frequent cause of intellectual disability  for  <dig> years  <cit> . until recently, most of this genomic imbalance was diagnosed by cytogenetic analysis, but studies over the past few years have found that id is caused by constitutional gains or losses of submicroscopic genomic segments even more often than by microscopically-apparent chromosomal aberrations  <cit> . our ability to recognize these submicroscopic genomic changes, which are usually called copy number variants , as the most frequent cause of id depends on the use of array genomic hybridization  . agh can survey the entire genome for imbalance that is 1/100th the size of that detectable by conventional cytogenetic analysis.

although agh is now being used routinely as a clinical test for the identification of chromosomal imbalance in people with id and other birth defects, controversy still exists regarding the most appropriate platform to use for this purpose. initial clinical studies were done with arrays having a few thousand bacs distributed at 1- <dig> mb intervals across the genome or with bacs targeted to regions where pathogenic submicroscopic deletions or duplications were known to occur. more recent studies have shown that arrays with higher resolution and genome-wide coverage provide better detection rates for pathogenic cnvs in children with id and normal cytogenetic analysis  <cit> . other methods have identified pathogenic cnvs that are too small to have been detected by the array platforms used in most agh studies  <cit> , so analysis at even higher resolution may be necessary to detect all pathogenic cnvs in children with id.

unfortunately, use of higher resolution agh for detection of genomic imbalance is confounded because most cnvs are not pathogenic. estimates of the mean number of apparently benign cnvs per person range from 6- <dig> in various studies, depending on the technology used to identify the variants and the size range used to define a cnv  <cit> . sequencing of the complete diploid genomes of normal individuals has shown that the number of cnvs per person is actually even greater  <cit> . distinguishing these benign cnvs from those that cause id and other birth defects is the most serious challenge to routine clinical use of agh.

we previously reported our findings using  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® agh  <cit>  to perform a genome-wide survey of benign and pathogenic cnvs in  <dig> idiopathic id trios, each comprised of an affected child and both unaffected parents. here we describe the results of a study of  <dig> new idiopathic id trios, as well as  <dig> of the trios tested previously, using  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® agh. we found that higher resolution agh detected a larger number of apparently pathogenic cnvs in both groups. many benign cnvs, including at least one that was de novo, were also detected with the  <dig> k agh, but it was possible to distinguish benign and pathogenic cnvs with confidence in almost all cases.

RESULTS
we performed agh with  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® arrays on  <dig> children with idiopathic id and on both parents of each affected child. fifty-four of these trios  had previously been studied with lower-resolution  <dig> k genechip® agh  <cit> ; the other  <dig> trios  were studied by agh for the first time with the  <dig> k genechip® arrays. data were analyzed to determine copy number along the length of all chromosomes except the y , and the findings for each child were compared with those for his or her parents. autosomal cnvs seen in the child and in at least one parent were considered likely to be benign polymorphisms. autosomal cnvs found in the child but not in either parent were evaluated by an independent method to confirm the presence of the cnv and its de novo occurrence. cnv calls on the x-chromosome in a female child were validated by an independent method if they appeared to have occurred de novo; cnv calls on the x-chromosome in a male child were validated by an independent method whether they appeared to be de novo or to have been inherited from the mother.

we found a total of  <dig> hits  in the  <dig> samples  analyzed by  <dig> k genechip® agh. this is an average of about  <dig> hits per sample, which is an underestimate of the total number of benign cnvs present because of the stringent cutoff used to obtain a false discovery rate of less than 5% .

within the  <dig> trios who were studied with both platforms, we found four times as many hits with  <dig> k agh as we did with  <dig> k agh . the ratio of the number of putative cnvs called with the  <dig> k platform to the number called with the  <dig> k platform was  <dig>  for cnvs between  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb in size but was lower for both smaller and larger cnvs .

two-tailed statistical significance was calculated with student's t-test.

the  <dig> putative cnvs called in all  <dig> trios were subjected to further bioinformatic analysis  to produce a final annotated list of  <dig> apparently de novo cnvs and two cases of mosaic trisomy that were called in  <dig> patients. these apparent genomic imbalances were subjected to validation by independent methods. thus, an apparent de novo cnv call that required independent validation was made in about  <dig> child in  <dig>  thirty-three of these cnvs in  <dig> patients and both cases of mosaic trisomy were confirmed to be de novo by an independent method and are described in detail below. the other putative cnvs were found to be present in both of the parents as well as in the child  in two instances or could not be confirmed to be present in the child  in  <dig> instances. altogether, false positive cnv calls were made in  <dig>  of the  <dig> trios studied and false negative cnv calls were made in  <dig>  of the  <dig> trios studied. in one other trio , an apparent de novo deletion of chromosome  <dig> called on agh in the child was found by fish to be a duplication of the region in both parents instead.

nineteen of  <dig> children with id in the new cohort were found by affymetrix  <dig> k genechip® agh to have de novo genomic imbalance that was confirmed by fish, mlpa, agh on an agilent®  <dig> k platform or cytogenetic re-analysis . one of these children  had mosaic trisomy  <dig>  and two were found to have de novo unbalanced reciprocal translocations - a dert in patient  <dig> and a dert in patient  <dig> - each producing both a terminal duplication and a terminal deletion identified by agh. we found de novo submicroscopic deletions in  <dig> other patients and de novo submicroscopic duplications in three other patients. the deletions ranged in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb; six were less than  <dig> mb. the duplications ranged in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb; one was less than  <dig> mb.

§ interphase fish in patient  <dig> showed some cells with no signals, some with  <dig> signal and some with two signals for a probe in the region of the deletion detected by agh. this was interpreted as evidence of somatic mosaicism for this deletion.

the table includes all de novo cnvs and mosaic trisomy detected by  <dig> k agh and confirmed by an independent method in a selected group of  <dig> trios who had previously been tested by  <dig> k genechip® agh  <cit> . breakpoints are shown on human genome assembly build  <dig> .

we found two instances of uniparental disomy , diagnosed by the occurrence of mendelian inconsistency in a region with a normal copy number of  <dig>  <cit> , among the  <dig> id trios in the new cohort studied by  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® agh . patient  <dig> has mosaic paternal isodisomy of most of the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  patient  <dig> has maternal upd  <dig>  being heterodisomic for the central portion of the chromosome and isodisomic for both ends. both cases were confirmed to be disomic with microsatellite markers .

the table includes all upd detected by  <dig> k genechip® agh and confirmed by an independent method in  <dig> children with idiopathic id. all mendelian inconsistencies observed were single. snps that are not listed as paternal upd, maternal upd, bpi* or mi* were uninformative with respect to upd. breakpoints are shown on human genome assembly build  <dig> .

* abbreviations used: h = heterodisomy, i = isodisomy, bpi = biparental inheritance, mi = mendelian inconsistency.

we judged the mosaic trisomy  <dig>  both unbalanced reciprocal translocations,  <dig> of the other de novo deletions, and two of the other de novo duplications found in the new cohort to be pathogenic . a mosaic  <dig> kb de novo deletion of chromosome  <dig> q <dig>   and a homozygous  <dig> kb deletion of the hla-g region that resulted from transmission by parents who both carried heterozygous deletions of the same region  were judged to be benign variants. a  <dig> kb deletion of chromosome 21q <dig>  , a  <dig> kb duplication of chromosome  <dig> q <dig>   and both cases of upd  were of uncertain clinical significance.

of the two de novo cnvs identified by  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® agh in the  <dig> children with id whose  <dig> k genechip® agh studies had been interpreted as normal , one is likely to be pathogenic and the other is of uncertain clinical significance. a  <dig>  mb deletion of 4p <dig>  in patient  <dig> is pathogenic because of its size, the inclusion of two genes that have been implicated in the wolf-hirschhorn syndrome , overlap with known pathogenic cnvs, and a compatible clinical phenotype. the  <dig>  mb duplication of 8q <dig> - <dig>  in patient  <dig> is of unknown clinical significance. it includes no refseq genes but involves a large  genomic region, most of which has never been reported to be polymorphic in normal individuals.

discussion
because its detection rate for pathogenic genomic imbalance is much higher than that of conventional cytogenetic analysis, a consensus has developed that agh should be used clinically for the evaluation of patients with id and other birth defects  <cit> . it is clear that agh using "targeted" arrays that only include probes for genomic regions known to be involved in microdeletion or microduplication syndromes has substantially lower detection rates for cnvs that cause id than agh using arrays that provide genome-wide coverage  <cit> . beyond this, however, there is no agreement regarding the kind of array, the distribution of probes across the genome, or the resolution that is most appropriate for clinical use. although bac arrays were initially used, most clinical laboratories now prefer oligonucleotide arrays because high-quality platforms that produce consistent results are reliably available from commercial sources. in addition, the use of larger numbers of smaller probes on oligonucleotide arrays permits more precise delineation of the breakpoints of cnvs that are detected, which facilitates genotype-phenotype correlation and clinical interpretation. agh with a snp array provides the additional advantage of generating genotypes that can be used to verify family relationships and find uniparental disomy as well as a second method  for identifying genomic imbalance  <cit> .

we previously reported that  <dig> k affymetrix genechip® agh is a robust platform for the detection of pathogenic cnvs in patients with id  <cit> . here we show that the detection rate of cnvs among such patients is higher with  <dig> k genechip® agh than with  <dig> k genechip® agh. we made about four times as many cnv calls overall with the  <dig> k platform as with the  <dig> k platform when using the same method of bioinformatic analysis in  <dig> trios studied with both technologies . we also found  <dig> instances of pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of  <dig> children with id and normal cytogenetic analysis studied by  <dig> k genechip® agh , compared to  <dig> instances of pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of  <dig> similarly-ascertained children tested by  <dig> k genechip® agh in our previous study. although the higher detection rate we observed with the  <dig> k platform may have occurred by chance because we just happened to include a few more patients with such genomic changes in the new cohort than in the  <dig> k cohort, we also found two additional de novo cnvs by  <dig> k genechip® agh among the  <dig> children whose  <dig> k agh was interpreted as normal in our earlier studies .

we detected three apparently de novo cnvs smaller than  <dig> kb among the  <dig> trios tested with  <dig> k genechip® agh in the new cohort , but none of these cnvs was clearly pathogenic. the overall size distribution of pathogenic cnvs detected by  <dig> k genechip® agh among  <dig> children with idiopathic id in the present study is similar to that observed by  <dig> k genechip® agh among  <dig> children with idiopathic id whom we studied previously  <cit>  . the higher detection rate on the  <dig> k array therefore appears to be related more to better probe coverage in relevant genomic regions and an improved ability to distinguish cnvs from background noise, rather than to a capacity to identify much smaller pathogenic cnvs. this is illustrated in families  <dig> and  <dig> , in which a  <dig>  mb duplication of 8q <dig> q <dig>  and a  <dig>  mb deletion of 4p <dig> , respectively, are obvious on the  <dig> k agh but were not called on the  <dig> k analysis. in retrospect, the 4p <dig>  deletion in patient  <dig> can be seen on the  <dig> k agh copy number plot despite the noisy data, but it was not called by either the automated analysis or visual inspection of these plots when the initial study was done. our failure to detect the de novo duplication of 8q <dig> q <dig>  in patient  <dig> was probably caused by the noisy data in the father's study.

distinguishing benign cnvs from those that cause id and other birth defects is a critical issue in routine clinical use of agh. benign cnvs occur in all people and are a major source of genetic variation in the normal population  <cit> . most apparently benign cnvs over  <dig> kb in size occur as polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies of at least 5%  <cit>  and are inherited from a parent  <cit> .

benign and pathogenic cnvs can usually be distinguished in patients with id and other birth defects by inheritance and genotype-phenotype correlation  <cit> . in this study, we identified a mean of about  <dig> cnvs per subject in the  <dig> id trios tested by  <dig> k agh. the vast majority of these cnvs were characterized as benign because they were inherited from a normal parent. genomic imbalance that occurs de novo in a patient with id whose parents are normal is more likely to be pathogenic than genomic imbalance that was inherited unchanged from a normal parent. we performed agh on both parents of every child with id to determine the inheritance of the cnvs found in the child, but this is sometimes not possible in clinical practice. in such instances it is necessary to infer likely de novo occurrence by information obtained from populations that have previously been studied  <cit> . great care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation when this is done, especially if the available data were obtained with lower resolution agh, the phenotypic characteristics of the comparison population are uncertain, reported polymorphic cnvs do not have exactly the same breakpoints as the cnv of interest, or the population frequency of a previously-reported cnv is unknown.

compelling evidence that a cnv in a person with id is pathogenic exists if the genomic imbalance is known to cause the patient's phenotype in other individuals, e.g., if a child with del 9q <dig>  has features of the 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome , a child with del 1p <dig> p <dig>  has features of the 1p <dig> deletion syndrome , or a child with del 17q <dig>  has features of the syndrome associated with this deletion . pathogenicity is also supported when a cnv includes a gene that is known to cause the patient's phenotype when inactivated  or over-expressed . on the other hand, a cnv is unlikely to be pathogenic if it involves a highly polymorphic region in which genomic loss  of the entire involved segment is known to occur in normal people.

if a direct genotype-phenotype correlation of this kind cannot be made in a particular case, certain genetic features of the cnv may provide clues to its pathogenicity. cnvs that are larger and those that involve gene-rich regions are more likely to be pathogenic than cnvs that are smaller and involve only gene-poor regions  <cit> . in addition, clinical experience suggests that deletions are more likely to be pathogenic than duplications  <cit> . the genetic content of a cnv may also make pathogenicity more or less likely. for example, involvement of a gene that lies within a pathway that is known to contain other dosage-sensitive genes associated with a similar phenotype strengthens the possibility of pathogenicity, while a cnv that does not contain any genes that are expressed in relevant tissues during embryogenesis is unlikely to be pathogenic for id.

there are, of course, exceptions to each of these "rules". some benign cnvs arise de novo  <cit> , as appears to have occurred in the de novo deletion of chromosome 14q <dig>  we found in patient  <dig>  the  <dig> kb region involved is highly polymorphic and contains several t-cell receptor variable region genes. on the other hand, some cnvs that are inherited from a normal parent are pathogenic for id. examples include maternal transmission of a ube3a deletion to a child with angelman syndrome  <cit> , maternal transmission of a mecp <dig> duplication to a son  <cit> , and cnvs such as dup 22q <dig>   <cit>  or del 1q <dig>   <cit>  that can cause id but exhibit incomplete penetrance.

although large  cnvs are often pathogenic, they may be benign  <cit> . most benign cnvs are small   <cit> , and it seems probable that the smaller a cnv, the more likely it is to be benign. nevertheless, no clear size distinction exists between benign and pathogenic cnvs. we found pathogenic cnvs as small as the  <dig> kb deletion of 9q <dig>  in patient  <dig> in this study, and others have reported even smaller pathogenic cnvs  <cit> . expression patterns, functional annotation and animal models can provide important clues to pathogenicity in some cases, but without knowledge of the phenotypic effects of a copy number alteration in humans, one can rarely, if ever, be certain whether a novel gain or loss of a particular genomic region can produce id or other birth defects.

in our  <dig> k agh study of  <dig> id trios,  <dig> de novo cnvs were called by bioinformatic analysis, and  <dig> of these cnvs were confirmed and shown to be de novo by an independent method. because we could assess the phenotypes of our patients in detail and correlate the findings with those obtained by agh, we were able to determine with confidence whether the genomic imbalance we observed was pathogenic or not in every case studied except three . such genotype-phenotype correlation is critical to determining the effects of novel cnvs detected by agh in patients with id.

a cnv of uncertain clinical significance was encountered in three  of the  <dig> trios analyzed in this series - a  <dig> kb duplication of 22q <dig>  in patient  <dig> , a  <dig> kb deletion of 21q <dig>  in patient  <dig>  and a  <dig>  mb duplication of chromosome 8q <dig> q <dig>  in patient  <dig> . this rate of cnvs of uncertain clinical significance is similar to that reported in large series of patients with id and other birth defects studied by agh with "targeted" chips  <cit> .

we were uncertain of the clinical significance of either case of upd that we detected. although only a few liveborn children with upd  <dig> have been recognized, the reported experience does not suggest that upd  <dig> can cause the abnormalities observed in patient  <dig>  <cit> . paternal upd 11p <dig> can produce beckwith-wiedemann syndrome  <cit> , but this phenotype is very different from that observed in the affected child in family  <dig>  however, as both of these cases involved isodisomy of a portion of the chromosome, we cannot rule out the possibility that the abnormal phenotype was produced by homozygosity for a recessive mutant allele  <cit> . although the detection of upd in addition to alterations of copy number is a theoretical benefit of using an array that includes probes for snps, the clinical utility of genome-wide screening for upd in patients with idiopathic id and other birth defects is uncertain.

we detected more pathogenic cnvs with  <dig> k agh than with  <dig> k agh, but some cnvs that were present among our patients were not detected using the  <dig> k assay. for example, our  <dig> k genechip® analysis failed to identify a pathogenic  <dig> kb deletion of chromosome 16p <dig>   involving the crebbp gene . this de novo deletion was found by agh on the agilent®  <dig> k platform and was confirmed by mlpa. the patient is an  <dig> year-old boy whose clinical features are characteristic of the rubinstein-taybi syndrome, which has been associated with deletions and other mutations of crebbp in other patients  <cit> . the  <dig> kb genomic region deleted in our patient is poorly represented on the  <dig> k genechip® arrays, with a total of only  <dig> snps. snp arrays have uneven genomic coverage, and the addition of non-polymorphic oligonucleotide probes to the design of arrays like the one used in this study has been shown to provide substantially better detection of cnvs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
affymetrix genechip®  <dig> k array genomic hybridization performed in individuals with idiopathic intellectual disability detected pathogenic genomic imbalance in  <dig> of  <dig> patients in whom  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization found genomic imbalance,  <dig> of  <dig> patients in whom  <dig> k genechip® array genomic hybridization had found no abnormality, and  <dig> of  <dig> patients who had not previously been tested. further improvements in array design, ongoing improvements in agh software, and continuing enhancement of resources like decipher https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/ and the toronto database of genomic variants http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/ are helping to establish agh as the primary clinical tool for recognition of genomic imbalance that causes id and other birth defects  <cit> . it seems likely, however, that no perfect agh platform for detection of pathogenic cnvs may ever exist and that effective clinical interpretation of these studies will continue to require considerable skill and experience  <cit> .
