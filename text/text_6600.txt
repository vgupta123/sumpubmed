BACKGROUND
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen colonizing the upper respiratory tract and skin of humans and other mammalian species. the nose is considered to be the primary ecological niche of s. aureus in humans
 <cit> . nasal carriage of s. aureus has been identified as a risk factor for the development of various infections in humans
 <cit> .

in  <dig> a new distinct sequence type  of methicillin-resistant s. aureus  has been isolated from pigs in the netherlands
 <cit> . since then, mrsa st <dig> has been detected in pigs, veal calves and poultry around the world
. the transmission of mrsa st <dig> from livestock to humans has been reported in many countries
 <cit>  and contact with livestock is recognized as a risk factor for human colonization
 <cit> . additionally, st <dig> isolates may cause infections in humans
 <cit> . however, the mechanisms underlying successful colonization of pigs and other livestock are incompletely understood.

the molecular mechanisms involved in s. aureus colonization have been mainly studied using human cell cultures
 <cit>  as well as rodent models
 <cit> . s. aureus colonization involves many factors
 <cit> . a crucial step of colonization is attachment to eukaryotic cells which involves several essential factors such as: clumping factor b , iron-regulated surface determinant protein a  and wall teichoic acid 
 <cit> . mutants deficient in one of the genes responsible for expressing these components displayed reduced cell-attachment properties in vitro
 <cit>  and showed reduced colonization in animal models
. additionally, a clfb mutant showed weakened colonization in the nares of human volunteers when compared to wild type bacteria, suggesting that clfb is one of the main s. aureus factors involved in human colonization
 <cit> . in addition to these factors, several other proteins  appear to be involved in colonization by binding to desquamated nasal epithelial cells which confirms the multi-factorial nature of s. aureus–host interactions
 <cit> .

the natural occurrence of s. aureus in pigs may involve similar colonization factors as assumed for humans. on the other hand, it has been shown that the mrsa st <dig> prevalence in pigs is high and that pigs are very rarely colonized by other s. aureus lineages. these observations suggest that additional factors may be involved in successful host adaptation and maintenance of colonization of s. aureus st <dig> in livestock. a study of viana et al. suggested that the presence of an additional von willebrand binding factor protein , encoded on a pathogenicity island , represents a host adaptation factor of s. aureus for animals
 <cit> . moreover, it has been suggested that mobile genetic elements  play a central role in the adaptation of bacteria to different host species
 <cit> .

to study s. aureus colonization in pigs, we have developed an ex vivo porcine nasal mucosa explants model
 <cit> . our aim was to identify bacterial factors involved in maintenance of s. aureus colonization in pigs by analyzing and documenting global gene expression changes in s. aureus during ex vivo colonization. this is the first study to examine changes in the complete s. aureus transcriptome during experimental colonization which mimics natural mrsa st <dig> colonization in pigs.

RESULTS
persistence of mrsa st <dig> s <dig> on porcine mucosa explants
the ability of s. aureus to colonize porcine mucosa explants was defined as persistence or outgrowth of mrsa s <dig> on the explants. the explants  were inoculated with 1 ml 3 ×  <dig> cfu/ml. after 2 h of incubation  and washing of the explants, approximately 8 ×  <dig> cfu/cm <dig>  adhered to the explants. the presence of s. aureus s <dig> on the mucosa explants was followed for an additional 180 min. during the first 30 min of this latter period, mrsa s <dig> showed an initial decline in the number of cfu to approximately 3 ×  <dig>  bacterial presence remained stable until 90 min into the experiment. in the following 90 min a significant increase of tissue-associated bacteria to approximately 4 ×  <dig> cfu/cm <dig> was observed . this indicates that mrsa s <dig> is able to establish and maintain colonization on the nasal explants during the experiment.figure  <dig>

s. aureustranscriptome dynamics during ex vivocolonization
to identify genes that possibly contributed to the successful maintenance of colonization of s. aureus st <dig> in pigs we analyzed the global changes in mrsa s <dig> gene expression during ex vivo colonization on porcine nasal mucosa explants compared to time-point  <dig> . from mrsa s <dig>  recovered at different time-points from the explants, rna was isolated, converted to cdna and the cdna hybridized with the s. aureus microarray.

in total we documented significant changes in the expression of  <dig> genes compared to time-point  <dig>  transcripts that were significantly up- or down-regulated  were visualized in a hierarchical clustering . regulation of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes was deemed to be biologically relevant . a total of  <dig> genes were negatively regulated and  <dig> genes were positively regulated . in general, there were no transcripts that changed in expression direction during the ex vivo colonization assay. for the majority of genes the change in expression compared t = 0 min was maximal for t = 60 min, whereas fewer genes showed their maximum expression during t = 30 min and t = 90 min. only a minority of the genes showed relatively large changes in expression for t = 180 min compared to t = 0 min.figure  <dig>

the regulated genes were mapped to available kegg pathways based on the gene ids. most regulated genes were involved in metabolic processes, probably reflecting metabolic adaptation to nasal mucosa explants, of fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis . in addition, regulation of the expression of genes that are part of the agr two-component regulatory system and a number of virulence genes was observed.

the genome of mrsa s <dig> contains a vwbp-encoding pathogenicity island, sapibov <dig>  which is widely distributed among s. aureus isolated from livestock
 <cit> . only a few genes located on this island were subject to regulation  in our model. it has been suggested that presence of the gene encoding an additional vwbp encoded on the pathogenicity island may play a role in bacterial adaptation to the animal host
 <cit> . during ex vivo colonization vwbp gene expression was up-regulated to its highest level at t = 60 min . other genes located on the sapibov <dig> showed a larger change in expression after t = 60 min.

mrsa s <dig> ex vivo colonization was also accompanied by changes in a number of putative virulence genes. the analysis showed  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold down-regulation of expression of genes in the cap operon encoding capsular biosynthesis during all time-points  and of the hla gene conferring alpha-hemolysis − <dig>  to − <dig> -fold change). up-regulation was observed for the cysteine proteinase cluster . the expression of the scpa gene encoding the cysteine proteinase was up-regulated during the entire experiment  and of the scpb encoding the cysteine proteinase cellular inhibitor . moreover, the expression of the genes that constitute the agr locus, which encodes a quorum sensing system that controls the expression of virulence genes was also down-regulated mainly at t = 60 min . however, regulation of agrd transcription was not detected.

to verify the microarray results, four genes of interest  were subjected to qrt-pcr  using the same rna samples. the qrt-pcr results confirmed the microarray data , although the fold change values determined by qrt-pcr were higher compared to the microarray data.figure  <dig>

s. aureus ex vivo colonization did not show regulation of genes encoding surface proteins responsible for attachment of bacteria to the epithelium . to determine whether these genes were expressed during ex vivo colonization qrt-pcr analysis was performed. the results showed that the three genes important for human colonization: clfb, isda, and fnba were expressed during the colonization of the pig tissue .

contribution of the vwbpand scpato ex vivocolonization
next, we generated isogenic vwbp and scpa deletion mutants of mrsa s <dig>  to investigate the potential role of these genes in mrsa s <dig> colonization. the vwbp and scpa mutants were tested in the ex vivo colonization assay . surprisingly, the colonization pattern of the wild-type, Δvwbp and Δscpa mutants did not show significant differences . these findings indicate that investigated genes are not crucial for colonization ex vivo, but may reflect adaptive changes during the colonization event.

discussion
the nostrils are the primary reservoir of s. aureus both in humans and pigs. nasal carriage of s. aureus has been identified as a risk factor for the development of various infections in humans
 <cit> . during the last decade, swine have appeared as the major reservoir of mrsa s. aureus st <dig> which also emerged in other livestock animals. currently, contact with livestock is recognized as the main risk factor for mrsa st <dig> colonization in humans. however, the factors which play a role in the colonization and maintenance of mrsa st <dig> in livestock are unclear. s. aureus colonization in humans and rodent animal models is a multifactorial process which includes steps like bacterial attachment to the cells, immune escape as well as competition between s. aureus and natural flora. identification of essential factors involved in s. aureus maintenance of colonization and adaptation in livestock are difficult to perform in an in vivo setting. previously, we reported the successful establishment of an ex vivo model to study mrsa colonization
 <cit> . using this model we were able to mimic the natural situation in pig’s noses under controlled conditions. during the ex vivo colonization, an initial decline in the number of cfu of s. aureus s <dig> during the first 30 min after inoculation was observed, which indicated that some bacteria still detach from the mucosa or die. later, a significant increase in the number of bacteria was observed, which indicated maintenance of colonization and even outgrowth of the bacteria. from these data we concluded that establishment of s. aureus in our model mimics the initial phases of nasal colonization defined as maintenance and/or outgrowth.

data on gene expression of s. aureus during colonization is limited to the direct transcript analysis of a few genes
 <cit> . global changes in gene expression during colonization have not been studied before. the major aim of our study was to identify bacterial factors involved in maintenance of colonization by determining and documenting the changes in s. aureus gene expression during ex vivo colonization.

the expression of  <dig> biologically relevant genes was regulated during culture on mucosa, when compared to t =  <dig>  the moment that unbound bacteria were removed from the explants. the expression of the majority of genes was highly regulated at 60 min after inoculation. at this time-point a net loss of bacteria is changing to a net increase mimicking colonization.

based on at least a two-fold change in expression, mrsa colonization apparently resulted in changes in regulation of metabolic pathways. the biosynthesis pathways for phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways were down-regulated, in contrast to the genes involved in the main amino acid biosynthesis pathways which were not regulated in our system. the active protein biosynthesis, together with lack of regulation of the de novo amino acid biosynthesis pathways indicates that the bacterial cells have access to these amino acids. the ex vivo colonization was performed at an air-liquid interface, where bacteria may have had contact with the cultivation medium  containing free amino acids which may have served as a source of amino acids for bacteria, although we carefully avoided the presence of culture medium on top of the explants.

a crucial step of s. aureus nasal colonization is adhesion to epithelial cells. it has been shown that clfb, isda proteins and wta are essential factors for s. aureus adherence to human cell lines in vitro
 <cit> , nasal colonization of rodents
 <cit> , and for nasal colonization of humans
 <cit> . after initial adherence, during the first 30 min mrsa s <dig> showed an initial decline in the number of cfu and significant increase of tissue-associated bacteria in later phase of the experiment consistent with colonization. in the pig nasal ex vivo system we did not observe regulation of expression of the adhesion genes, however the genes were expressed. in our settings, bacteria used for tissue inoculation were harvested in the mid-log phase, where adhesion factors are well expressed. therefore, contact with the nasal epithelium did not result in regulation of the expression of genes encoding adherence factors such as clfb, isda, and fnba. the alternative explanation, that the relevant mrnas were not detected is unlikely based on the results of the data analysis and experience with highly similar microarray experiments for s. aureus
 <cit> .

expression of the most adhesins is under the regulation of the agr system
 <cit> . the agr system has a dual action in the global gene regulation in s. aureus. this system positively regulates toxins, extracellular proteases, immunomodulation factors and capsule biosynthesis, but represses the expression of some of the surface proteins such as protein a, coagulase and fibrinogen binding protein past the exponential phase. during ex vivo colonization the agr locus was down-regulated. however, the agrd gene, part of the agr locus, was not significantly regulated. this gene may be expressed at a basal level without a change in regulation. additionally, we observed down-regulation of hla and the cap operon, which are controlled by the agr system . burian et al. had similar findings showing that during s. aureus colonization of the human nose and in cotton rats the agr system is weakly expressed
 <cit> .

interestingly, the cysteine proteinase operon  was up-regulated during the whole experiment. scpa is known to cleave a number of extracellular matrix components and it has been suggested to play a role in bacterial migration from the sites of initial colonization
 <cit> , but it may also play a role in the acquisition of nutrients
 <cit> . it has been suggested that the extracellular proteases can promote s. aureus skin and nares colonization by degradation of some s. aureus virulence factors like toxins
 <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that s. aureus scpa protease is associated with diseases such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
 <cit>  and is involved in vascular leakage causing sepsis
 <cit> . the up-regulation of the extracellular proteinase scpa indicates that this protein may be involved in establishment of colonization ex vivo. to study the influence of the cysteine proteinase for colonization ex vivo, we generated a scpa isogenic mutant. however, a single knockout mutant did not show any phenotypic difference in colonization pattern ex vivo, which indicates that scpa does not play a crucial role in colonization/adaptation ex vivo.

also the up-regulation of some genes located on sapibov <dig> was observed. this mobile element encodes an additional von willebrand factor binding protein. it has been shown that s. aureus harboring a pathogenicity island with the additional vwbp are widely distributed in ruminants and it has been suggested that this protein is one of the adaptation factors for s. aureus to animal hosts
 <cit> . our study showed that during s. aureus st <dig> interaction with porcine nasal epithelium the vwbp was strongly up-regulated during the first phase of the experiment , where the initial decline of cfu was observed. this may indicate that vwbp may be important in s. aureus adaptation to the porcine nasal epithelium and may promote s. aureus colonization ex vivo. however, the single knockout mutant did not show any phenotypic difference in colonization pattern ex vivo, which indicates that vwbp also does not play a crucial role in colonization/adaptation ex vivo.

in this study, we successful applied an ex vivo model to study changes in the gene expression regulation during colonization using one reference st <dig> strain. our previous study showed in an ex vivo model, colonization of different mrsa types from animal and human origin
 <cit> . a study of szabo et al. also reported a slight difference in pig colonization between different mrsa types
 <cit> . further study on gene expression of different s. aureus strains, during ex vivo colonization should be performed to understand strain specific colonization mechanisms.

there are few limitations of our model, which may influence s. aureus gene expression. first of all, adhesion of the bacteria onto the tissue was performed in dpbs. furthermore, the host immune response will be absent, which might manifest itself in lack of regulation of the immune escape genes and influence s. aureus gene expression. moreover, in our system we are not able to preserve the natural microbiota present in nasal mucosa tissue. in natural conditions, s. aureus must also compete with other bacterial species, which also would influence the global changes in gene expression. recently, it has been reported that in humans, these interactions in the microbiota of the nasal cavity, influence the colonization of s. aureus
 <cit> . investigation on the microbiota in the nasal cavity of pigs and the bacteria interaction is necessary to understand the colonization process of s. aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
we could for the first time establish changes in the global gene expression pattern of s. aureus during ex vivo colonization. additionally, this study suggests that nasal colonization with mrsa st <dig> is a complex event that is accompanied with changes in bacterial gene expression regulation and metabolic adaptation.
