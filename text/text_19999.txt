BACKGROUND
cyclin d <dig> plays a critical role in the regulation of proliferation by adjusting its expression levels to reflect the proliferative signaling environment of the cell, and then by regulating the cell cycle control machinery accordingly <cit> . cyclin d <dig> functions primarily to bind and activate the cyclin dependent kinase  4/ <dig>  which then phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein . upon phosphorylation rb releases the transcription factor e2f, which is then able to activate the transcription of genes required for g1/s phase transition <cit> . the cyclin d1/cdk4/ <dig> complex is also able to sequester p27kip <dig> and other cdk inhibitory proteins, thereby neutralizing their inhibitory capacity for cyclin e/cdk <dig> <cit>  whose activity is required for g1/s transition <cit> .

the regulation of cyclin d <dig> activity is primarily dependent upon its expression level. this level is controlled by the regulation of gene expression, mrna stability and translation, and by protein stability. cyclin d <dig> mrna synthesis is regulated by mitogenic signaling pathways downstream of ras activity. these include the raf- <dig>  mek1/ <dig> and erks pathways <cit>  ; along with the ral and rac gtpases  <cit> . translational control of cyclin d <dig> is also under the control of growth factor signaling through activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e, an effector of the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase /akt/mtor signal pathway  <cit> . the stability of cyclin d <dig> protein also plays a major role in the regulation of its expression. phosphorylation on thr- <dig> has been reported to result in rapid proteasomal degradation of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . it is also possible that this phosphorylation results in the export of cyclin d <dig> from the nucleus where it is functionally inactivated due to separation from its nuclear substrates  <cit> . in either case, the kinase responsible has been reported to be glycogen synthase kinase  <dig> , which is an excellent in vitro kinase for cyclin d <dig> thr- <dig>  <cit> . gsk <dig> is presumed to be constitutively active and therefore able to suppress cyclin d <dig> levels until phosphorylated. this phosphorylation can be carried out by akt, which is in turn activated by pi3k  <cit> , suggesting that the pi3k/akt/gsk <dig> pathway controls cyclin d <dig> stability  <cit> .

not only are overall cyclin d <dig> levels critical in the growth properties of the cell, the levels of this protein are actively regulated through the cell cycle. we observed this fact using quantitative image analysis of antibody stained asynchronous cultures. cyclin d <dig> expression was found to be high in g <dig> and g <dig> phase cells, but fell to low levels during s phase  <cit> . subsequent studies have demonstrated that this expression pattern is vital to the regulation of ongoing cell cycle progression. the elevation of cyclin d <dig> during g <dig> phase depends upon proliferative signaling, and is required for the continuation of cell cycle progression  <cit> . suppression of cyclin d <dig> during s phase is required for dna synthesis, since high cyclin d <dig> levels are reported to bind pcna and are able to block dna synthesis  <cit> . the requirement that cyclin d <dig> levels fall during s phase is likely to restrict the chance of uncontrolled proliferation resulting simply from the elevated expression of cyclin d <dig>  <cit> . critically, we have found that the specific suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase is dependent upon phosphorylation of thr- <dig>  since a mutation at this position blocked s phase cyclin d <dig> suppression  <cit> . these studies were undertaken to test the possibility, suggested by the above considerations, that the phosphorylation on thr- <dig> responsible for the suppression of cyclin d <dig> during s phase is catalyzed by gsk <dig> 

if gsk <dig> were responsible for the s phase suppression of cyclin d <dig>  its activity would likely be lower during g <dig> and g <dig> phases than during s phase. one mechanism for achieving this cell cycle regulation of gsk <dig> activity would be for the activities of pi3k and akt to be modulated through the cell cycle. there is a precedent for such cell cycle variations in proliferative signaling. for example, when oncogenic ras is introduced into nih3t <dig> cells, cyclin d <dig> levels are rapidly induced, but only during g <dig> phase  <cit> . moreover, signaling downstream of ras activity suppresses p27kip <dig>  levels throughout the cell cycle, but this is accomplished during each cell cycle phase through the activation of separate signaling molecules  <cit> . however, we find here that neither the activity of proliferative signaling kinases nor of gsk <dig> itself varies through the cell cycle. in fact, we find that gsk <dig> is not responsible for the suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase. rather, we now postulate that cyclin d <dig> suppression during s phase is the result of cell cycle position rather than proliferative signaling.

RESULTS
the cyclin d <dig> expression pattern is not altered by signaling inhibitors
if the pi3k/akt/gsk <dig> pathway stabilizes cyclin d <dig> levels specifically during g <dig> and g <dig> phases as suggested above, inhibitors of this pathway would produce a reduction in cyclin d <dig> expression during these cell cycle phases to the low levels seen during s phase. thus, inhibition of these signaling pathways would be expected to result in low, uniform expression of cyclin d <dig> throughout the cell cycle. pi3k was inhibited by ly <dig>  while the kinase mtor was inhibited by rapamycin in actively cycling human diploid fibroblast  cultures. after  <dig> hrs treatment, including a terminal pulse with brdu, the culture was fixed and stained with fluorescent antibodies against both cyclin d <dig> and brdu, while dna was stained with dapi. individual images of each fluorochrome were collected with a sensitive ccd camera, and subjected to image analysis to accurately quantitate the level of each fluorochrome in each cell . the results were displayed by plotting the cyclin d <dig> level of each cell against its dna level, with brdu positive cells noted . treatment with ly <dig> dramatically reduced cyclin d <dig> levels, yet the overall cell cycle pattern of expression was maintained, with higher levels observed during g <dig> and g <dig> phases as in untreated cultures. rapamycin had a similar but weaker effect on the cyclin d <dig> level . neither inhibitor produced the uniform cyclin d <dig> expression through the cell cycle we had predicted.

we next inhibited akt activity by microinjecting a plasmid expressing a dominant inhibitory mutant. this plasmid, pcdna3-akt-dn  generates a kinase-dead akt protein that can be detected within the cells by antibody staining. staining confirmed the high level expression of the mutant protein at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs following plasmid injection. this protein, however, did not induce any obvious alteration in cyclin d <dig> expression after  <dig> hrs . the average expression levels of cyclin d <dig> in injected cells at  <dig> hrs  and  <dig> hrs  confirmed that the there was no change in the cyclin d <dig> profiles in cells expressing an excess of inhibitory akt protein.

it is possible that proliferative signaling molecules other than those inhibited above might be responsible for s phase cyclin d <dig> suppression. to test this possibility proliferative signaling in general was disrupted by serum withdrawal for  <dig> hrs. in this case, the level of thr- <dig> phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig> was directly determined with a phosphorylation site-specific antibody , and compared to total cyclin d <dig>  to avoid rapid degradation of phosphorylated cyclin d <dig>  <cit> , the cells were treated with the proteasomal inhibitor mg <dig> for  <dig> hrs prior to analysis. serum withdrawal for  <dig> hrs slightly reduced both total and thr-286-phosphorylated cyclin d <dig>  significantly, however, the ratio of phospho/total cyclin d <dig> was not changed by serum deprivation in any cell cycle phase . this indicates that the overall rate of cyclin d <dig> thr- <dig> phosphorylation is not altered in any cell cycle phase by disruption of proliferative signaling following serum removal. taken together, the above results fail to support the notion that alterations in proliferative signaling through the cell cycle are responsible for the cell cycle specific expression pattern of cyclin d <dig> 

the activity of critical signaling molecules remains constant through the cell cycle
to extend the above observations, we designed experiments to directly analyze the activity of individual proliferative signaling molecules through the cell cycle, to determine if there are alterations in proliferative signaling activity sufficient to account for the proposed variations in gsk <dig> activity. we first analyzed the activity of pi3k in individual cells of an asynchronous nih3t <dig> culture using a plasmid expressing the ph domain of akt linked to gfp  <cit> . t. balla and associates have shown that the resulting protein strongly binds phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, the lipid product of pi3k activity, resulting in its association with the plasma membrane upon activation of pi3k  <cit> . to directly visualize the redistribution of fluorescence at the time of pi3k stimulation, the akt-ph-gfp plasmid was microinjected into quiescent nih3t <dig> cells. the intracellular distribution of fluorescence was determined by confocal analysis  <dig> hrs later without serum addition, or  <dig> min following addition of 10% serum to the culture. without serum addition, the fluorescence was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus . upon serum stimulation, however, the fluorescence became associated with the plasma membrane , including particularly high concentrations associated with tiny projections on the plasma membrane. thus, the loss of fluorescence from the nucleus and cytoplasm, coupled with its redistribution to plasma membrane structures was diagnostic for pi3k activity .

this assay was then applied to actively cycling nih3t <dig> cells, where we found that the fluorescence of all cells remained evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. specific association of fluorescence with the plasma membrane was not observed in any of these cells . to demonstrate that cycling cells did retain the ability to produce a high level of pi3k activity, the ph-akt-gfp plasmid was injected into proliferating nih3t <dig> cells, after which serum was removed from the culture for 5– <dig> hrs, and then added back. within  <dig> minutes of the addition of serum back to these cultures the fluorescence became associated with the plasma membrane, characteristic of pi3k activation described above for quiescent cells .

these results present an interesting model of proliferative signaling in cycling cells. the high levels of pi3k activity observed following serum addition to quiescent cultures most likely represents the response to a change in growth condition rather than a normal consequence of cell cycle progression. while pi3k activity is present in and required for the proliferation of actively cycling cells, the levels required are apparently much lower than observed upon serum stimulation. importantly, there was no evidence of alterations in pi3k activity during s phase or any other cell cycle period in asynchronous cultures, reducing the likelihood that such an alteration might be responsible for the elevation in gsk <dig> activity, and the corresponding decline in cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase.

akt is activated uniformly through s and g <dig> phases
the above study of individual cells in an actively cycling culture was next confirmed by biochemical analyses in synchronized cell populations. a single treatment of nih3t <dig> cells with  <dig> mm thymidine has been shown to result in their synchronization in s phase. following removal of thymidine, treated cells remain in s phase for  <dig> hrs, and enter g <dig> phase approximately  <dig> hrs later  <cit> . critically, we have confirmed that the cell cycle expression profile of cyclin d <dig> in such synchronized cultures behaves as in asynchronous cultures, with low levels in s phase cells, followed by increasing levels upon entry into g <dig> phase . cultures prior to or at various times following release from thymidine blockage were tested by western analysis for the activating phosphorylation of akt , while cyclin d <dig> expression levels are presented for comparison . no evidence of alterations in the activation level of akt was apparent at any time following release from thymidine blockage, as the cells passed from s to g <dig> phase. as a control, the levels of the activating phosphorylation on akt were seen to increase dramatically within  <dig> and  <dig> min following treatment of quiescent nih3t <dig> cells with serum. moreover, in the cultures which showed no difference in akt activation levels, the levels of cyclin d <dig> protein were seen to increase during passage from s to g <dig> phase . we conclude that alteration in the activity of akt is not responsible for suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase.

gsk <dig> activity is constant in synchronized s and g <dig> phase cells
from the above results it is clear that the proliferative signaling pathway upstream of gsk <dig> does not vary through the cell cycle. however, it is possible that a pathway other than pi3k/akt is responsible for regulation of gsk <dig> activity  <cit> . therefore, antibody staining as well as biochemical analyses were performed to directly study variation of gsk <dig> activity through the cell cycle. nih3t <dig> cells were synchronized in s phase by thymidine treatment and released as described above. most of the cells progressed from s to g <dig> phase  <dig> hours after the release. the cells were collected at the indicated times, and the gsk <dig> phosphorylation was analyzed by western analysis with an antibody specific to the inhibitory phosphorylation of gsk3β on position  <dig> . total gsk <dig> was also determined and the phospho-gsk3/total gsk <dig> ratio presented . we next directly determined the activity of gsk <dig> by synchronizing cells as described above, and immunoprecipitating gsk <dig> at the indicated times following release. the immunoprecipitated protein was then assayed with a synthetic peptide substrate whose phosphorylation was analyzed by page analysis. due to the low level of activity of gsk <dig> in nih3t <dig> cells, this assay was repeated  <dig> times to obtain consistent results . there was some increase in gsk <dig> activity immediately upon release from thymidine blockage, but no evidence of any alteration upon passage from s to g <dig> phase. for comparison, there was a reduction in activity upon addition of serum to quiescent cultures, while the levels of gsk <dig> activity declined only gradually following serum removal from actively cycling cultures . as a control, the inhibition of gsk <dig> activity by  <dig> mm licl is demonstrated . it is clear from these results than neither the upstream signaling pathway leading to gsk <dig> control, nor the activity of gsk <dig> itself varies during passage from s to g <dig> phase in synchronized cultures, or in actively cycling cells. this places doubt on the role of proliferative signaling or gsk <dig> activity in suppressing cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase.

inhibition of gsk <dig> activity has no effect upon cyclin d <dig> expression
experiments were next designed to determine if gsk <dig> activity plays a role in cyclin d <dig> expression or phosphorylation in any cell cycle phase. gsk <dig> activity was inhibited by  <dig> mm licl, and the proteasomal inhibitor mg <dig> was added to allow the accumulation of phosphorylated cyclin d <dig>  to determine if the inhibition of gsk <dig> would reduce the phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig>  the effect of this treatment upon phospho-thr- <dig> accumulation was determined by image analysis following staining with the phospho-thr-286-specific antibody  <cit> . licl influenced neither the total amount of cyclin d <dig> nor its level of phosphorylation following staining of human diploid fibroblast mrc <dig> cells. this is apparent from the cell cycle expression profiles , and from average levels determined from these profiles . to confirm the results with licl, we performed similar experiments on nih3t <dig> cells with two other gsk3β inhibitors, sodium valproate  <cit>  and gsk <dig> inhibitor ii from calbiochem. neither of these treatments altered the ratio of total cyclin d <dig> to phosphorylated cyclin d <dig> .

this critical result was next confirmed by western analysis. nih3t <dig> cultures were treated with medium containing  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm licl to inhibit gsk <dig> activity, or with medium containing equivalent amounts of nacl as a control. mg <dig> was added to block degradation of phosphorylated proteins as above. after treatment for  <dig> hrs the levels of total and phosphorylated β-catenin were determined by western analysis with appropriate antibodies, while actin was analyzed as a loading control. β-catenin is a well characterized substrate of gsk <dig>  its phosphorylation would, therefore, serve as an indication of the activity of gsk <dig> within the treated cells. since the lysate was not separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions  <cit> , little alteration in the total β-catenin levels were seen . on the other hand, high levels of phosphorylated β-catenin were observed in cells cultured in normal medium . phosphorylated β-catenin levels were dramatically reduced by  <dig> mm licl  and almost completely eliminated by treatment with  <dig> mm licl . levels of the phosphorylated proteins were observed only when their degradation was blocked by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, mg <dig> . the results were confirmed by quantitating the ratio of phosphorylated to total β-catenin . on the other hand, in these same lysates neither concentration of licl had any effect upon the phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig> on thr- <dig> . this conclusion was confirmed following quantitation of the western bands to determine the ratio of phosphorylated to total cyclin d <dig> levels . the fact that licl was able to block the phosphorylation of a well known gsk <dig> substrate, without influencing the phosphorylation of cyclin d1within the same cells, confirms the above conclusion that gsk <dig> is not a major kinase for cyclin d <dig> in these cells.

to strengthen this conclusion, gsk <dig> protein was ablated with a commercial sirna mixture reported to suppress levels of both gsk <dig> α and gsk3β. to confirm its effectiveness, this sirna was injected into nih3t <dig> cells  <dig> hrs prior to a second injection of a plasmid expressing the gsk <dig> β gene . following these injections the cells were fixed and stained with a fluorescent antibody stain against gsk <dig>  while the plasmid expressed high levels of gsk <dig> when injected alone , prior injection with sirna totally blocked expression of the high exogenous levels of gsk <dig> . even though the endogenous levels of gsk <dig> are low, these endogenous levels were also suppressed by the injected sirna . we conclude that the sirna is able to efficiently ablate gsk <dig> expression. this sirna was injected into nih3t <dig> cells, which were left over night prior to treatment with mg <dig> and staining with the phospho-thr- <dig> cyclin d <dig> antibody. the sirna had no influence upon phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig> , or upon total cyclin d <dig> levels . we conclude that inhibition of gsk <dig> does not alter normal cell cycle regulated phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig> 

over-expression of activated gsk <dig> β does not suppress cyclin d <dig> levels
the influence of gsk <dig> upon cyclin d <dig> degradation in nih3t <dig> and mrc <dig> cells was next directly analyzed by microinjection of a plasmid expressing a constitutively active gsk <dig> β protein   <cit> . injected cells were stained for gsk <dig> and cyclin d <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs following injection. gsk <dig> staining was strong in injected cells at both time points, and displayed a cytoplasmic localization in most of the cells; whereas the staining was close to background level in the uninjected cells, indicating that the exogenous gsk <dig> level is far above the endogenous level . however, the exogenous, constitutively active gsk3β did not apparently alter cyclin d <dig> levels at  <dig> hrs  or  <dig> hrs  following injection.

the effect of injected gsk3β upon cyclin d <dig> expression was next analyzed quantitatively. at  <dig> hrs following injection of the gsk3β expression plasmid cells were fixed and stained with fluorescent antibodies against cyclin d <dig> and gsk <dig>  the intensity of each stain in each cell was determined by quantitative image analysis, and the gsk <dig> levels were plotted vs. cyclin d <dig> levels . the basal cyclin d <dig> level was apparent from the analysis of uninjected cells. this level of cyclin d <dig> expression was altered little if at all in cells containing even high levels of exogenous gsk3β. we conclude that gsk3β has little influence over cyclin d <dig> levels in nih3t <dig> cells  <dig> hrs following injection. similar results were obtained at  <dig> hrs in nih3t <dig> cells, and in mrc <dig> cells . finally, the average expression level of phospho-thr- <dig> cyclin d <dig> was determined in each cell cycle phase following injection of the gsk3β plasmid as above, and compared to uninjected cells. in no case was there any difference between injected and uninjected cells in the level of phospho-thr- <dig> cyclin d <dig> .

gsk <dig> is potentially involved in g <dig> phase
the above experiments show no evidence for the involvement of gsk <dig> in cyclin d <dig> expression or phosphorylation in any cell cycle phase. it should be emphasized, however, that all of those studies were performed upon cells cultured with normal growth factors which might have induced proliferative signaling within the cells to neutralize all gsk <dig> activity, thereby masking its potential role in regulating cyclin d <dig> in the absence of serum. this possibility is supported by the fact that while cyclin d <dig> suppression following serum removal is primarily due to reduced mrna stability, there is also evidence for a limited role of altered protein stability upon serum removal  <cit> . to test the possibility that gsk <dig> might play a role in cyclin d <dig> regulation in the absence of serum, nih3t <dig> cells were given a brief pulse of brdu prior to serum removal for  <dig> hrs. thus, cells in s phase at the time of serum removal would be labeled with brdu. it is known that these cells would progress normally through mitosis, but with low cyclin d <dig> levels  <cit> . to determine if gsk <dig> might play a role in maintaining cyclin d <dig> at low levels in these serum-deprived cells, they were treated with  <dig>  or  <dig> mm licl to inhibit gsk <dig> activity at the time of serum removal. our attention was focused upon the brdu labeled cells to determine if their cyclin d <dig> levels remained low upon entry into g <dig> phase. the addition of  <dig>  mm licl failed to alter cyclin d <dig> levels, but  <dig> mm licl treatment resulted in the elevation of cyclin d <dig> levels in some of the cells passing from s to g <dig> phase in the absence of serum . three duplicate experiments were performed and compared to demonstrate a significant increase in g <dig> phase cyclin d <dig> levels in serum deprived cells cultured with  <dig> mm licl . we interpret this result as potential evidence for a limited role of gsk <dig> in regulating g <dig> phase levels of cyclin d <dig>  particularly when proliferative signaling is limited. this conclusion, however, is complicated by the fact that  <dig> mm licl slowed passage of cells into mitosis, resulting in an extended g <dig> phase . we do not know if this extended g <dig> length might contribute to the slight elevation of cyclin d <dig> levels induced by licl in this experiment.

discussion
the fact that cyclin d <dig> levels are suppressed during s phase as a result of phosphorylation on thr- <dig>  <cit>  suggests that the kinase responsible might be gsk <dig> . if gsk <dig> were responsible for the cell cycle specific suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels, the activity of this kinase and those signaling molecules which regulate its activity would be expected to vary in activity through the cell cycle. thus, inhibition of these signaling molecules would be expected to abolish the cell cycle variations in cyclin d <dig> levels. we found, however, that inhibitors of pi3k, rapamycin and serum removal all suppressed cyclin d <dig> levels, but that this suppression was uniform through the cell cycle. the typical cell cycle expression pattern of cyclin d <dig> was not altered by any of these treatments. moreover, cyclin d <dig> expression was not significantly suppressed in any cell cycle phase by expression of a dominant inhibitory akt mutant protein, which is able to directly regulate gsk <dig> activity. these results fail to support the notion that these signaling molecules are responsible for specific suppression of cyclin d <dig> during s phase. to extend this result, the activity of signaling molecules was tested throughout the cell cycle. pi3k activity was assessed in individual cells with a gfp chimeric protein able to bind phosphatidylinositol- <dig> phosphate. the activating phosphorylation of akt and the inactivating phosphorylation of gsk3β, together with the enzymatic activity of total gsk <dig>  were assessed biochemically in synchronized populations. there was no evidence that any of these signaling activities vary thorough the normal cell cycle.

these results not only raise questions regarding the role of proliferative signaling in regulating cyclin d <dig> levels through the cell cycle, they bring into question the overall role of gsk <dig> in regulating cyclin d <dig> levels in living cells in general. to directly analyze the involvement of gsk <dig> in the control of cyclin d <dig> levels, its activity was inhibited by a variety of small molecule inhibitors, while its cellular levels were suppressed by sirna. in no case was there any quantitative change in cyclin d <dig> levels in any cell cycle phase. licl failed to alter the phosphorylation of cyclin d <dig> on thr- <dig> even though it efficiently blocked phosphorylation of β-catenin in the same cells. finally, constitutively activated gsk <dig> β was introduced into living cells and found to have no influence upon cyclin d <dig> levels. we conclude that gsk <dig> does not play a role in the suppression of cyclin d <dig> during s phase, and that it is unlikely to be involved in the regulating cyclin d <dig> levels in the nucleus during any cell cycle phase. the one potential uncertainty with these results is the fact that in all the above experiments the cells were in the presence of normal serum levels. these might promote the constant suppression of gsk <dig> activity in these cells, masking the potential involvement of this enzyme in cyclin d <dig> regulation in the absence of proliferative signaling. in a final analysis, serum was removed from cycling nih3t <dig> cells to allow gsk <dig> to become active, and then in some cultures it was again inhibited by the addition of licl. there was a slight, if minor elevation of cyclin d <dig> in a small proportion of g <dig> phase cells in the serum-deprived cultures treated with licl. it is not clear, however, if this was the direct result of cyclin d <dig> phosphorylation by gsk <dig>  or the ability of gsk <dig> to interfere with passage through g <dig> phase.

the possibility that gsk <dig> might have an effect upon cell cycle progression is supported by its ability to influence a variety of cellular processes in addition to insulin and glycogen metabolism. it is directly involved in regulating cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . gsk <dig> is also able to phosphorylate transcription factors involved in growth regulation, including c-myc, c-jun and c-myb  <cit> ; and has been implicated in the action of growth factors on neural cell growth  <cit> . it is also able to regulate development directly  <cit> , and as a member of the wnt signaling pathway  <cit> . gsk <dig> is able to phosphorylate the tau protein, involved in alzheimer's disease  <cit> ; play a role in mitotic spindle function  <cit> ; repress hedgehog signaling  <cit> , and regulate cyclin e stability  <cit> . recent studies implicate its action in cell polarity determination  <cit> . the results presented here suggest that the ability of gsk <dig> to phosphorylate a protein in vitro might not indicate that it has a role in the normal regulation of that protein within a living cell  <cit> . this conclusion, however, should be considered cautiously in cases where cell based assays indicate a connection between gsk <dig> and the regulation of a cellular protein  <cit> .

even though gsk <dig> has been implicated in a number of regulatory pathways, our view of gsk <dig> as a modulator of a wide variety of cellular processes must be reconsidered in light of recent genetic studies. with a reverse genetics approach in drosophila, the inhibitory phosphorylation of gsk <dig> was shown to play a critical role in the action of the insulin/pi3k pathway, but was not involved in the stimulation of growth by pi3k  <cit> . in addition, knock-in studies in mice with homozygous activating mutations of both gsk3α and gsk3β demonstrated that while glycogen metabolism was altered in some tissues, the animals were otherwise normal in growth and development  <cit> . while developmental alterations can mask the normal role of a mutant protein, these studies emphasize the importance of carefully analyzing the role of gsk <dig> in signaling processes. in the studies reported here, we find that despite the fact that gsk <dig> is able to phosphorylate cyclin d <dig> on thr- <dig>  <cit> , this molecule does not play a role in the cell cycle regulated expression of cyclin d <dig>  our evidence further suggests that it may not play any major role in the expression of cyclin d <dig> in human and murine fibroblast cells. the possibility remains that gsk <dig> plays some role in other cell types, particularly during the growth factor induced increase in nuclear cyclin d <dig> during g <dig> phase. it has been shown, however, that ubiquitination of cyclin d <dig> can efficiently take place following phosphorylation of another site  <cit> , or without the apparent requirement for phosphorylation  <cit> . consistent with this conclusion, studies by others demonstrated that thr- <dig> does not play a major role in the overall regulation of cyclin d <dig> levels in a variety of cells, although it is reported to play a role in the intracellular localization of this protein through the cell cycle  <cit> . our studies on intracellular localization of cyclin d <dig> with the use of quantitative image analysis, however, have failed to produce any evidence of relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during passage into s phase  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
these studies demonstrate that while the pi3k/akt pathway plays a critical role in progression through the cell cycle, its activity in cycling cells is relatively low compared serum stimulated cells, and is invariant through the cell cycle. the cell cycle-specific effects of this signaling pathway reported previously  <cit> , therefore, must result from the differences in the way target proteins are effected during different cell cycle phases. it is, thus, clear that the suppression of cyclin d <dig> during s phase is not the result of altered signaling during this cell cycle period. we conclude that increased phosphorylation of thr- <dig> and reduced cyclin d <dig> stability are regulated by factors that are present throughout s phase, and in no other cell cycle period. this implies that the suppression of cyclin d <dig> levels during s phase will take place in every s phase regardless of the signaling environment of the cell, or the activity of any particular signaling molecule. this suppression not only allows the cell to actively synthesize dna  <cit> , but ensures that upon entry into g <dig> phase cyclin d <dig> levels are always low. since the continuation of proliferation depends upon high levels of cyclin d <dig> during g <dig> phase, it would thus be necessary that the cell induce cyclin d <dig> levels each time it enters g <dig> phase if it is to continue proliferating. thus, the apparently automatic suppression of cyclin d <dig> during each s phase ensures that signaling events of the previous cell cycle are erased, and forces the cell to re-evaluate the proliferative signaling environment prior to entry into the next cell cycle. these observations also have implications for tumor formation. elevated cyclin d <dig> levels clearly play a central role in the stimulation of proliferation. it is possible that the simple over expression of cyclin d <dig>  therefore, might lead to uncontrolled cell growth. the fact that its levels must decline during each s phase, however, limits the extent to which cyclin d <dig> levels can increase. thus, since cyclin d <dig> has both positive and negative proliferative influences during different cell cycle phases, its regulation must remain relatively normal for cell growth to take place at all. this places severe limitations upon the extent to which a tumor cell can simply alter cyclin d <dig> levels as a means to achieve unrestrained growth properties  <cit> .
