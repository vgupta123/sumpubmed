BACKGROUND
the transcription factor pax <dig> is required for development and maintenance of several human ocular tissues, including the corneal epithelium. the gene pax <dig> was identified by positional cloning as the defective gene in human aniridia and its associated ocular complications  <cit> .

heterozygous deficiency in pax <dig> leads to ocular surface disease characterized by corneal opacification , and the pax6+/- mouse model displays all the morphologic defects of human ark  <cit> . ark in pax6+/- mice and humans is characterized by the presence of thin, fragile vacuolated corneal epithelia  <cit> . there is ingrowth of blood vessels into the cornea, sporadic appearance of goblet cells  <cit> , and infiltration by inflammatory cells  <cit> . the cell biology that links pax <dig> dosage to changes in cellular behavior remains poorly understood. maintenance of the structural integrity of the corneal epithelium is essential for corneal transparency. impaired re-epithelialization after wounding increases the risk of infection, exacerbates inflammation, and undermines normal stromal remodeling  <cit> . the cumulative effect of very small corneal scars following chronic failure of wound repair may result in loss of transparency. it has recently been suggested that ark may be due to corneal epithelial fragility combined with an abnormal wound-healing response  <cit> , resulting in degeneration of the cornea.

epithelial sheets react to mechanical injuries via a complex process that relies on coordinated proliferation and migration into the denuded area, matrix deposition and tissue remodeling  <cit> . wound-induced migration and proliferation are regulated by cytokines, extracellular matrix molecules, and growth factors including insulin-like growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor   <cit> .

one of the first reactions to injury of the cell monolayer is an intracellular calcium rise spreading as a wave from the injury site to the neighboring cells. this has been reported in a range of cell systems, mainly in cell lines  <cit> . the wound-elicited calcium wave stimulates cell proliferation after injury, and is required for further healing processes  <cit> . the intensity of the calcium response quantitatively controls the subsequent rate of healing in some epithelial cells, and remodeled calcium signaling may underlie disease states such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, manic depression and alzheimer's disease  <cit> .

alongside the calcium wave, the other early response of epithelial cells to wounding is at least one slower wave of mitogen-activated protein kinase  erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . the migration of at least some epithelial cell types appears to be erk1/2-driven  <cit> . addition of egf activates erk1/ <dig> in a 'wild-type' rabbit corneal epithelial cell line  <cit> , and exerts positive effects on epithelial wound healing by promoting migration and mitosis  <cit> . in corneal epithelial cells, egf exhibits a positive effect on proliferation via orchestrated calcium influx from intracellular calcium stores and extracellular space  <cit> .

work by our laboratory and several others have investigated the roles of pax <dig> in control of cell adhesion in development and disease, but the downstream cell-signaling pathways have received less attention. we hypothesised that cell signaling may be faulty. as a model for the reactive cellular pathways that may be controlled by pax <dig>  we have developed an in vitro wounding assay for murine primary corneal epithelial cells and have investigated the roles of pax <dig> in corneal healing. we find that unlike wild-type, pax6+/- cells fail to commence healing within the first  <dig> hours after wounding, and that wound-induced waves of calcium and phospho-erk1/ <dig> signaling are required for rapid response to wounding. propagation of the wound-induced calcium wave is defective in pax6+/- cells, but addition of egf restores calcium signaling and promotes erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, rescuing their rapid response to wounding.

RESULTS
wound healing is delayed in pax6+/- corneal epithelial cultures
the wound-healing response was investigated in primary murine corneal epithelial cells, cultured as described previously  <cit>  on plastic or glass on which epithelial cells could attach and proliferate. all experiments were performed on mouse cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  pax6+/- and pax6+/+ cells looked morphologically identical, although pax6+/- cultures grew more slowly than wild-type in the first week after explant, and had multiple defects in cell-surface glycoproteins, which will be described elsewhere . epithelial monolayers were strongly positive for nuclear pax <dig> staining , which is required for corneal epithelial development and is a definitive marker for these cells. in contrast, the widely used human corneal epithelial cell line   <cit>  was found not to express pax <dig> . pax6+/- cultures had lower levels of pax <dig> protein than wild-type, assayed both by immunocytochemistry  and western blotting . densitometric analysis of the western blots  showed that pax6+/- cultures had 63% of the amount of pax <dig> produced by wild-type cultures.

corneal epithelial cultures from pax6+/+ and pax6+/- littermates were injured as described in methods and the rate of migration into the denuded area measured. all wounds healed, and the rates of cell migration were similar to those observed in vivo  in wild-type rat corneas by song et al  <cit> . however, pax6+/- cultures exhibited a wound-healing delay. wound healing in the first  <dig> h after injury was negligible in pax6+/- cultures  in contrast to pax6+/+  . interestingly, however, between  <dig> and  <dig> hours post-injury, there was no significant difference in the rate of healing between pax6+/-  cultures compared with pax6+/+ . the data suggest that pax6+/- cells experience a previously undescribed block that prevents their initial response to an injury but that they have no intrinsic cell-migration defect. we know of no other genetic defect that causes a comparable wound-healing delay.

calcium response to wounding
no difference was detected in the basal i levels between pax6+/+ and pax6+/- cultures using fura- <dig> probe . the effects of mechanical injury on intracellular ca2+ levels were investigated using fluo- <dig> fluorescent probe. background images were acquired for each experiment  prior to injury. wound size was approximately  <dig> μm in diameter, and the wound area did not differ significantly between experiments. immediately after injury , those cells directly adjacent to the wound edge exhibited a rapid rise in i . the ca2+ response propagated outwards to neighboring cells away from the wound edge . the wave began to diminish within  <dig> seconds, and i had returned to basal levels within  <dig> minutes . the ca2+ response to injury was quantified in pax6+/+ and pax6+/- cultures . the mean changes in fluorescence in cells in the sixth row from the wound edge were quantified over time. a significant decrease in both intensity and speed of the ca2+ wave was observed in pax6+/- cultures . interestingly, there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity in those cells directly adjacent to the wound between pax6+/+ and pax6+/- , but the intensity of i was reduced in cells in row  <dig>   <dig> seconds after injury, . the peak fluorescence intensity occurred  <dig> seconds after wounding in pax6+/+ cells but after  <dig> seconds in pax6+/- cells, and was substantially suppressed in pax6+/- cultures . this is the first demonstration that changing pax <dig> dosage affects calcium signaling in any system.

calcium wave initiation and propagation
the initiation of the calcium wave  was normal in pax6+/- cells, but the propagation was defective. we showed that the two phases can be decoupled but that both are required for healing. to investigate the source of ca2+ ions involved in the wave that spreads from the wound edge, we removed ca2+ independently from the extracellular and intracellular compartments of pax6+/+ epithelial cells. cells were first injured as normal in calcium-free medium. following injury, those cells directly adjacent to the wound edge failed to elicit a significant ca2+ response . wave propagation  was nevertheless detectable  . peak fluorescence intensity occurred  <dig> seconds after injury in ca2+-free media compared with  <dig> seconds for pax6+/+ cells in control media.

in separate experiments, intracellular calcium stores were depleted by  <dig> μm thapsigargin, which inhibits the ca2+atpase pump of the endoplasmic reticulum. following injury, cells directly adjacent to the wound edge rapidly increased i, but subsequent wave propagation was prevented . wave initiation and propagation in murine corneal epithelial cells can therefore be decoupled. intracellular ca2+ is required only for wave propagation.

when either extracellular calcium or intracellular ca2+ stores were depleted, both pax6+/+ and pax6+/- cells failed to repair wounds . the rate of healing in untreated pax6+/+ controls was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h in thapsigargin-treated cultures  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h in calcium-free media . hence, both phases of the ca2+ response are required for coordinated wound closure.

propagation is via p2y receptors, but atp cannot rescue mutant cells
adenosine triphoshate  is a potent extracellular signaling molecule involved in cell-cell communication, via purinergic  receptors  <cit> . atp can initiate a ca2+ wave, and is released in response to injury in epithelial cells  <cit> . pax6+/+ epithelial cells were incubated with the p2y receptor inhibitor suramin  prior to mechanical injury. no significant difference was detected in the ca2+ response in cells adjacent to the wound edge, but wave propagation to surrounding cells was inhibited , suggesting a possible mechanism for wave progression in response to injury. addition of  <dig> μm atp alone could induce similar low-intensity ca2+ waves in both pax6+/+ and pax6+/- cultures, suggesting that p2y receptors function normally in mutant cells, and that atp release could be the missing factor in the pax6+/- response to mechanical injury. however, the addition of atp  <dig> seconds prior to wounding in pax6+/- produced no improvement in the intensity  or speed of wave progression . peak fluorescence occurred after  <dig> seconds in untreated pax6+/- cultures and after  <dig> seconds in those to which atp was added. similarly,  <dig> μm atp made no impact on the rate of wound healing in pax6+/- cultures . this suggests that atp is not responsible for the defect in the ca2+ wave or in wound healing in pax6+/- cultures.

egf can restore the calcium wave and rescue wound-healing defects
egf receptors are upregulated following corneal injury  <cit> . we proposed that the egf response might mediate the rate of wound healing. we found that  <dig> ng/ml egf elicited a ca2+ response in our cultures. however, the rise in pax6+/- cultures was delayed  and reduced . pax6+/- cultures injured in the presence of  <dig> ng/ml egf induced a wave of ca2+ of greater intensity than in control pax6+/- cultures, which was comparable to the control pax6+/+ response . furthermore, egf specifically improved the initial  rate of wound healing in pax6+/- cells from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h  to a level that was comparable with pax6+/+ cultures . thus, the addition of egf to pax6+/- cells enabled them to overcome the block that prevents them initially from responding to a wound and beginning the healing process, but did not increase the rate of cell migration in the 'post-initial' 2– <dig> hour phase of healing.

erk1/ <dig> response to injury
egf can activate the intracellular map kinase signaling molecules erk1/ <dig>  which are themselves phosphorylated in response to injury  <cit> . because erk1/ <dig> signaling has been shown to be precipitated by calcium influx in epithelial cells  <cit> , the erk1/ <dig> response was investigated in our system. we found by immunocytochemistry that corneal epithelial cells showed dynamic injury-induced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  <dig> minutes after injury, becoming restricted primarily to the nuclei of cells at the immediate wound edge within  <dig> minutes . this dynamic early wave of erk1/ <dig> activation, with an initially cytoplasmic localization, and variation in intensity of staining along the wound edge, is identical to that seen previously by others in the mdck epithelial cell line  <cit> .

pax6+/- cells also elicited a phospho-erk1/ <dig> response to wounding . using immunocytochemistry, it appeared that erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in pax6+/- cells was stimulated by addition of egf  <dig> seconds prior to wounding. this was confirmed by western blotting . egf had no effect on the levels of pax <dig> protein in cultures, assayed by western blotting .

we investigated the requirement for erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation for wound healing. wild-type and pax6+/- cells were injured in the presence of  <dig> μm u <dig> to inhibit the activated erk1/ <dig> pathway. it was found that addition of u <dig> specifically prevented migration of pax6+/+ cells within the first  <dig> hours after wounding  . in contrast, migration of wild-type cells 2– <dig> hours after wounding in the presence of u <dig> was relatively normal , although still marginally significantly slower than the untreated controls  . to determine whether this confined effect was caused by degradation of the drug after the first  <dig> hours of incubation with the cells, the experiment was repeated with replacement of the culture medium with fresh medium containing  <dig> μm u <dig> every  <dig> hours. this had no additional effect; the rate of pax6+/+ cell migration 2– <dig> hours after wounding with addition of fresh drug at  <dig> and  <dig> hours  was not significantly different that of experimental groups with a single addition of drug prior to wounding . similarly, u <dig> had no effect on wound healing by pax6+/- cells. in the first  <dig> hours after wounding, untreated cells showed negligible rates of migration, as described previously, and addition of  <dig> μm u <dig> did not change that. during hours 2– <dig> after wounding, u0126-treated pax6+/- cells healed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h, with or without addition of fresh drug – slower than untreated pax6+/- controls  but not significantly different from drug-treated pax6+/+ cells  .

consistent with the transient erk1/ <dig> activation response to wounding, we conclude that erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation within the first  <dig> minutes is required for the initiation of cell migration. in the absence of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, pax6+/+ cells experience a wound-healing delay, but all cells, whatever their pax <dig> genotype, can overcome this block and start migration after about  <dig> hours. it is clear that there are other signaling systems that can elicit a wounding response, which were not investigated here.

discussion
pax6+/- mice represent an excellent model of human pax6+/- aniridia-related keratopathy. clinically, the symptoms of ark are consistent with an altered wound-healing response  <cit> . pax <dig> directly binds matrix metalloproteinase- <dig>  promoter to upregulate mmp- <dig> in wounded corneas  <cit> . mmp- <dig> is one of a family of proteins required for tissue remodeling during wound repair. experiments carried out previously on intact pax6+/- corneas suggested in a non-quantitative manner that pax6+/- corneas do heal  <cit> , but investigated cell migration on a diseased stroma, which may modulate wound healing  <cit> . the etiology of ark is complicated, because anterior eye development is coordinated to some extent by the lens, which is very sensitive to pax <dig> dosage  <cit> , and although the corneal epithelium expresses high levels of pax <dig> throughout life, the stroma also expresses pax <dig> around birth  <cit> . corneal epithelial dysgenesis in pax <dig> mutants might be the result of intrinsic defects within the epithelial cells themselves or the fault of defective tissue-tissue interactions in the eye. the extent to which tissue-tissue interactions contribute to corneal epithelial dysgenesis can be addressed by isolating the epithelial cells. if cultured mutant corneal epithelial cells were phenotypically and molecularly normal, we would infer that the corneal epithelial defects were secondary to a problem with pax <dig> dosage elsewhere in the eye. to identify the primary defects that underlie the etiology of the disease, we therefore investigated wound healing in pax6+/- corneal epithelial primary culture. we developed and validated an in vitro system for wound healing in primary murine corneal epithelia. cells formed pax6-positive confluent epithelial sheets, and we demonstrated that they show physiological calcium and mapk responses to injury. the results of the investigation were surprising, with fundamental implications for the links between transcription-factor action, cell signaling, cell behavior, and disease.

pax <dig> dosage and wound healing
pax6+/- corneal epithelial cultures expressed substantial quantities of pax <dig>  estimated to be about 60–70% that of wild-type. pax <dig> autoregulates its own expression  <cit> , and there is no direct 1: <dig> relationship between pax <dig> gene dosage and the levels of protein present in the cells  <cit> . overexpression of pax <dig> in corneal epithelial cells inhibits cell-cycle progression  <cit> , and the anterior eye is particularly sensitive to dosage of important transcription factors, with <70–80% or >~150% activity leading to dysgenesis  <cit> . furthermore, corneal epithelial cells are derived from pax6-positive stem-like cells in the corneal periphery   <cit> , and heterozygosity at the pax <dig> locus compromises these cells  <cit>  and leads to the production of corneal epithelia that may not be fully differentiated  <cit> . we consider, therefore, that abnormal behavior of pax6+/- corneal epithelial cells in culture may relate to a failure of full differentiation that occurred in vivo days or weeks before.

we showed that wound healing was delayed for  <dig> hours in mutant cells, but that once healing began, the cells moved as fast as wild-type. rates of cell migration, at 25– <dig> μm/h for wild-type cells, are similar to those obtained by song et al for wild-type rat corneas in vivo  <cit> .

while this paper was under review, a new paper  <cit>  showed that in ex vivo whole-eye culture, pax6+/- corneas healed faster than wild-type over a 24-hour period. the first  <dig> hours of wound healing were not studied by ramaesh et al  <cit> , levels of pax <dig> were not assayed, and the calcium or mapk response to wounding in the epithelium was not studied. as described above, in the whole-eye culture system, the corneal epithelial migration is modulated by the presence of an inflamed stroma, which would be expected to accelerate cell migration over extended periods of healing. another important difference between the experiments is the size of the wounds, which were very large  in the study by ramaesh et al  <cit> , encompassing up to half the cornea and encroaching on the limbal region. larger wounds in pax6+/- corneal epithelia healed faster than smaller wounds , and extrapolation from figure  <dig> in that study  <cit>  suggested that wounds smaller than  <dig> μm in diameter would heal more slowly than wild-type. wounds in our system are smaller and more physiological, rarely larger than  <dig> μm, so there is therefore no immediate contradiction between our work and this new study; however, the situation appears to be more complicated than that presented by either paper, and there is clearly more work needed.

our data show that there is no defect per se in the ability of mutant cells to migrate normally, providing they get the correct signals. the delay in wound healing was, however, intrinsic to the epithelia, so we investigated the immediate responses to wound healing in mutant cells.

calcium wave and healing rate
we are unaware of any other genetic model of epithelial wound healing where cells appear to fail to sense wounds initially, but migrate normally once this block is overcome. the mechanisms underlying this failure have wide relevance for the understanding of the molecular basis of the wound-healing response. in this study, it was found that the delay in pax6+/-wound healing was associated with a decrease in the intensity and rate of propagation of the wound-induced calcium wave. extracellular calcium was required for the large initial calcium rise, and intracellular calcium stores were shown to be essential for wave propagation. hence, it is suggested that the failure in pax6+/- cells is due to slow or inefficient release of calcium from stores. it has been shown previously that a quantitative decrease in capacitive calcium entry to wounded gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial cells, facilitated by calcium release from the stores, leads to a quantitatively reduced healing response  <cit> . we have also found a consistent link between wound-healing rate and the intensity and speed of the calcium wave after wounding. pharmacological disruption of any aspect of the calcium wave in pax6+/+ cells therefore recapitulated a wound-healing defect . our data strongly support a model whereby the injury-elicited calcium wave is required for wound healing  <cit> , and indicate that the subnormal propagation of the calcium wave in pax6+/- corneal epithelia underlies the wound-healing delay.

egf signaling and the calcium and erk responses
in gastric mucosal epithelia, extracellular signaling  elevates intracellular calcium, which in turn activates erk, leading to cell proliferation  <cit> . the activation of erk pathways by calcium signaling in response to extracellular signals has also been observed in a number of neural cell types  <cit> . wounding of both pax6+/+ and pax6+/- corneal epithelia elicited erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in a dynamic manner around the wound within  <dig> minutes. by  <dig> minutes after wounding, however, perk1/ <dig> immunolabeling was restricted primarily to nuclei of cells immediately adjacent to the wound edge. the pattern of immunolabeling was identical to that found previously by matsubayashi et al  <cit>  upon wounding of mdck epithelial cells. they showed that inhibition of the erk1/ <dig> signalling pathway reduced wound healing by about 50% in the  <dig> hours after wounding. we also found this; over the whole  <dig> hours of the experiment, mean ± sem rate of wound healing of untreated wild-type cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h, compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/h for wild-type cells treated with u <dig>  however, we have extended the conclusions of matsubayashi et al with a finer temporal assay of rates of wound healing, and show that although erk1/ <dig> inhibition does reduce the rate of cell migration during healing, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation is primarily required for the rapid response to wounding within the first  <dig> hours.

the distribution of egfr is abnormal in pax6+/- corneal epithelia  <cit> , and our data demonstrate that the calcium reaction in response to egf of unwounded pax6+/- cells is significantly lower than in pax6+/+. addition of exogenous egf to wounded pax6+/- cells enhanced both the wound-elicited calcium wave and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, and restored the immediate migration response to wounding to wild-type levels without affecting the rate of migration. this suggests that pax6+/- egf signaling is defective, perhaps due to reduced autocrine egf production or failure of normal egfr activity. egf is known to enhance capacitative calcium entry  in corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . because cce is known to be quantitatively coupled with the migration speed in mucosal epithelial wound repair  <cit> , this suggests a possible mechanistic explanation of positive egf action on the wound-healing rates via calcium in our system.

egf also acts via erk1/ <dig> to downregulate pax <dig> and promote proliferation in rabbit corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . we detected no change in pax <dig> levels following egf addition to pax6+/- cells, but this is not inconsistent with the results of li and lu  <cit> , because our study investigates the cellular responses within the first few minutes of wounding, whereas changes in pax <dig> protein levels would be expected to take much longer than this. furthermore, in the present study, it is unlikely that cell proliferation affects wound-healing rates, because the changes in cell proliferation take several hours . we have detected no difference in 5-bromodeoxyuridine uptake between primary cultures with different pax <dig> dosages, and very little cell proliferation is noted in the first  <dig> h after wounding , whereas pax6+/+ cells, and pax6+/- cells with exogenous egf, begin to migrate within the first few minutes. our data suggest that egf signaling functions via enhanced calcium and erk1/ <dig> signaling to initiate cell migration.

wound healing in pax6+/- corneas
based on our data, we divide wound healing into an immediate period of  <dig> hours when calcium and mapk signaling occur to initiate a rapid migratory response, and the subsequent 'post-initial' coordinated movement of epithelial sheets when cell migration is maintained. in the hours subsequent to this, cell proliferation is initiated; this last process is also modulated by pax <dig> and the role of pax <dig> in this regard has been studied previously  <cit> .

we propose a model, based on our data combined with previous studies cited earlier, which postulates that pax <dig> dosage does not affect the rate of corneal epithelial cell migration per se on a neutral substrate. in contrast, the primary defect of the pax6+/- corneal epithelium is the initial failure to respond to wounding. we have shown that upon wounding a corneal epithelium, external calcium enters cells around the wound, and this is quantitative similar in both wild-type and pax6+/- cells. further propagation of calcium rise to cells away from the wound is required for the wound response, which is realized by cell-cell signaling via p2y receptors and involves predominantly calcium from intracellular stores. we have shown that this process is inefficient in pax6+/- cells, and that secondary messenger erk1/ <dig> signaling pathways must also be activated following wounding to initiate immediate cell migration. calcium signaling occurs in the first  <dig> minutes, whereas erk1/ <dig> signaling is expected to peak about 3– <dig> minutes after wounding  <cit> . both calcium and erk responses are sensitive to egf, which is present in tears at 1– <dig> ng/ml  <cit> , and we show that calcium response to egf is diminished in heterozygotes . together, these cell-signaling problems decelerate the response of mutant cells to small physiological wounds. in vivo, the chronic delay in sealing small holes caused by minor abrasion or other cell loss may be sufficient to allow the corneal stroma to become compromised, leading to opacity. we therefore link a transcription factor mutation, via defects in calcium signaling, to a cellular abnormality that underlies human disease.

microarray study in the lens suggested that as many as  <dig> genes may be regulated by pax <dig>  <cit> . it was perhaps expected therefore that the links between pax <dig> and cell behavior would be pleiotropic, with a complex etiology intractable to mechanistic investigation. our data suggest, however, that this is not the case, and that the link between genetics of disease and pharmacological correction  may not be so esoteric.

wound healing is in part a recapitulation of important developmental pathways,  <cit>  and it is very likely that the genetic pathways investigated here recapitulate genetic pathways that are controlled by pax <dig> during development. we hypothesize that in other organ systems where pax <dig> and calcium signaling are both known to be required, such as axon guidance  <cit> , pax <dig> dosage may directly control the kinetics of the calcium response of cells to their external environment.

CONCLUSIONS
propagation of wound-induced signaling via calcium release from intracellular stores is inefficient in pax6+/- corneal epithelial cells, and this underlies an intrinsic wound-healing delay. pax <dig> dosage does not, however, affect the rate of cell migration in healing epithelia, 2– <dig> hours after wounding. map kinase signaling via phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> is required for the immediate wound-healing response, but has only a marginal effect on the rate of cell migration in a healing epithelium. addition of egf prior to wounding rescues the calcium response in mutant cells and exaggerates the levels of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, restoring rapid wound-induced cell migration. failure to respond quickly to minor wounding in fragile pax6+/- corneal epithelia could lead to the observed chronic corneal degeneration in patients, but our data suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the egf pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy.
