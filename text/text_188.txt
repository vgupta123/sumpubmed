BACKGROUND
the gene expression changes occurring in the surface tissues of fish after rhabdoviral natural infections have not been described yet. in the most studied infection-by-injection models, internal organs are affected by the infection before surface tissues, while the contrary is expected to occur in the infection-by-immersion models which mimick the natural route of infection.

under laboratory controlled conditions, trout rhabdoviral infections produce 100% mortalities after infection-by-injection, while only 60-80% wild type  <cit>  or 5% rhabdoviral-resistant  <cit>  mortalities could be obtained after infection-by-immersion. these results suggested that the natural route of infection is an important determinant for the final outcome of fish rhabdoviral diseases.

some infection-by-immersion studies using recombinant viruses showed that the fin bases, skin and other fish epithelial surfaces were the earliest sites of replication for rhabdoviral  <cit>  and other viral  <cit>  infections. furthermore, after viral haemorrhagic septicemia  infection, zebrafish showed early hemorrhages in the skin, fin bases, mouth and gills long before dying  <cit> . the fin bases therefore, were chosen for this study as a representative fish surface tissue and because they were easy and reproducibly harvested. from the fish surface tissues, rhabdoviruses spread to the fish internal organs  <cit> . therefore, internal organs  were also chosen as potential tissue responders to delayed infection-by-immersion and to compare their responses with those obtained at the fin bases.

the zebrafish danio rerio was chosen because the sequence of their genome is well advanced and ~ <dig> k annotated quantitative polymerase chain reaction  arrays or partially annotated oligo microarrays are available. furthermore, zebrafish are susceptible to several rhabdoviruses of fish farmed species  <cit> , whose infection severity can be modulated by viral dosage and temperature. vhsv was selected among the other rhabdoviruses because of their importance in fish aquaculture and because protection and adaptative immune responses to vhsv-challenges after vaccination have been demonstrated in cold-acclimatized zebrafish  <cit> . lower than physiological optimal temperatures induce a delay on fish adaptative immune responses while some of the innate immune responses  are up regulated  <cit> . however, little is known about the detailed gene regulation implicated in innate responses in fish when temperature decreases and viral susceptibility becomes maximal, such as it occurs during most rhabdoviral natural outbreaks  <cit> .

therefore, the differential  protein and immune-related transcript expression of zebrafish fin tissues after vhsv infection-by-immersion were the focus of this work. the results demonstrated the important variability associated with in vivo fish experiments. at the protein level and despite variability, vhsv-infection changed the differential expression levels of most fin enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and their cytoskeleton proteins. however, because most immune-related proteins remained undetectable by the proteomic approach, their rna expression levels need to be also investigated. at the transcriptional level, vhsv-infection increased the differential expression of several fin immune-related genes while decreased those of the internal organs. while these findings shed some light upon the earliest effects of vhsv infection-by-immersion at the molecular level, some of the newly described genes might even be used for adjuvant testing purposes.

RESULTS
infection-by-immersion of cold-acclimatized zebrafish with vhsv
cold acclimatized zebrafish infected-by-immersion in  <dig> ×  <dig> focus forming units  of vhsv per ml, at 14°c induced mortalities of 80-100%. under those conditions, most zebrafish showed the first external hemorrhages around the mouth and gills, in the lateral skin or in the fin bases, 5- <dig> days post infection .

although every individual zebrafish followed a different time course of vhsv spreading to its body until its death, 2-days after infection-by-immersion there were no mortalities in any of the different experiments performed . the time courses of subsequent mortalities  were delayed a few days  compared to those previously reported in trout  <cit> . previous zebrafish acclimatation to 14°c during  <dig> days was required for the vhsv infection to cause high mortalities, confirming previous results  <cit> . reduction of the acclimatation time from  <dig> to  <dig> days, reduced to 10-30% the mortalities .

two days after infection-by-immersion, vhsv n mrnas levels corresponded to  <dig>  ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv in the fins and  <dig>  ×  <dig> ffu  in the organs  per individual zebrafish  .

studies on the protein and transcript differential changes occurring on zebrafish fins or organs, 2-days after infection-by-immersion at high mortality conditions were then undertaken.

protein changes in the zebrafish fins induced by vhsv infection by 2d-dige
the characteristic protein profile of zebrafish fins showed three major multiple spot regions between 48- <dig> kda distributed around isoelectric points  of ~ <dig>  their yellow color confirmed that their levels remained unchanged after vhsv infection. most of the differentially expressed protein spots  were between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. the most differentially expressed spots  were excised, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry . protein identifications summarized in table  <dig> showed that the characteristic major yellow spots corresponded to keratins , cytokeratins  and actins  .

exp <dig>  experiment  <dig>  exp <dig>  experiment  <dig>  exp <dig>  experiment  <dig>  spot n°, number of spot selected in the  <dig> d gel of exp <dig>  for mass spectrophotometry  identification.  <dig>  numbers of spots selected in  <dig> d gels of exp  <dig> or  <dig> . gel spots were digested with trypsin and their peptides identified by ms. the corresponding detected proteins with a 100% of probability score of identification are shown grouped by their function. *, spots hypothetically identified by their apparent molecular weight  and isoelectric point  in their respective  <dig> d gels. ---, spots too faint to be quantified. ~mw and ~pi, apparent molecular weight  and isoelectric points  in the  <dig> d gel. accession number of the identified protein sequences in the protein bank. fold, calculated by the decyder-differential in-gel analysis software by the formula, volume of the spot in the vhsv-infected fin/volume of the spot in the non-infected fin. the spots on figure  <dig> which have no corresponding description on table  <dig> could not be identified by ms. microarray differential expression data was obtained as explained in the legend of table  <dig>  because most of the protein genes appeared several times in the microarray, their corresponding folds were calculated as the means for each of their data . nf, not found annotated in the microarray.

most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway increased upon vhsv infection, such as fructose-bisphophate aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphopyruvate dehydratase  and lactate dehydrogenase. also an atp binding protein was decreased, while an atp synthase was increased, most probably contributing with all the above enzymes to atp accumulation in the vhsv-infected fins .

the levels of different types of keratins specific for epithelial cells were maintained after vhsv infection  while others such as keratin  <dig>  type i and type ii cytokeratins increased. skeletal α-actin, α-tropomiosin, kinesin and filament-actin  crosslinking transgellin decreased after vhsv infection suggesting the reduction of f-actin networks. myosins, capg, scinderin, cyclase-associated protein- <dig>  dynamin and semaphorin also changed after vhsv infection.

annexins  a1a and 1a increased while annexins a5b and 5b decreased with vhsv infection. proteins implicated in haematopoiesis such as transferrins and hemopexins increased, as probably demanded by the hemorrhages caused by vhsv infection. increase of  <dig> isoforms of fgf <dig>  a protein implicated in fin regeneration were also detected in one of the experiments .

vhsv proteins were searched among those spots located in their expected molecular weight/pi regions on the  <dig> d gels. however, none could be detected, most probably due to their relative low abundance among the fin proteins 2-days after infection.

among the few immune-related proteins which could be detected by this approach, only the high mobility group binding  <dig>  protein and the guanine nucleotide binding protein β polypeptide  <dig>  could be detected. both increased after vhsv infection. because of the scarce number of immune-related proteins detected by the 2d-dige experiments, most probably due to their low concentrations in fins, studies on the vhsv-induced transcripts by using immune-related q-pcr arrays and hybridization to oligo microarrays were then undertaken.

immune-related transcripts changing in fins and organs after vhsv infection analyzed by q-pcr arrays
differential expression with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  estimated by q-pcr arrays showed that while  <dig> immune-related transcripts increased in fins, only  <dig>  increased in organs . furthermore, maximal differential transcript levels of any p value were of ~36-fold in fins, while only of ~ <dig> fold in organs .

for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected. rna was extracted from the fins or organs 2-days after vhsv or mock infection, converted to cdna and used for the amplitaq reaction in  <dig> well plates containing  <dig> ×  <dig> selected immune-related zebrafish taqman assays . in each plate,  <dig> ×  <dig> assays of the rplp <dig> gene were used for normalization. the mean and their corresponding p  were then calculated from  <dig> experiments. the transcripts from either fins and/or organs with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  changes were first tabulated and then the rest of the table was completed with their corresponding calculated fold values in organs and/or fins, respectively. fold, expression level in vhsv-infected tissue/expression level in non-infected tissue. +, increased. -, decreased. ~, similar. figure  <dig> shows the representation of means and standard errors  of all the genes.

complement component fin transcripts corresponding to c3b, c8g and c <dig> increased after vhsv infection , while the same transcripts did not increased in organs, except c <dig> .

major histocompatibility complex class i  transcripts, one of the induced host molecules identified in most infections-by-injection, increased more than 3-fold in the fins, however, it was not increased in organs . other differentially increased transcripts in fins which were not increased in organs were those corresponding to the secreted immunoglobulin domain  <dig>  of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and macrophage stimulating factor . among all the cluster differentiation  antigen transcripts present in the immune-related probes , only cd <dig> and cd  <dig> were differentially increased in fins but not in organs .

among the transcripts corresponding to the interleukin  genes studied , only il <dig> d and its related il <dig>  were differentially increased in fins. some of the other il <dig> family members such as il17a/f <dig> and il <dig> d were also increased in fins, however, with p >  <dig>  . there were not similar increases in organs for any of the studied il transcripts .

interferon  transcripts, which increased > 2-fold in zebrafish organs after vhsv infection-by-injection in a previous report  <cit> , did not changed at the fins/organs after infection-by-immersion . however, the primers designed to estimate ifn <dig> by the q-pcr gene expression assay , only amplified the virus-independent ifn <dig> isoform which remains unaltered upon viral infection  <cit> .

defensin β  increased in organs and fins  but it was eliminated from table  <dig>  because both of their transcript levels showed p >  <dig> .

no immune-related gene transcripts decreased >  <dig> fold in fins , while of the  <dig> transcripts that decreased > 2-fold in organs, only crfb <dig> have p <  <dig>  .

immune-related transcript changes in fins/organs after vhsv infection by hybridization to oligo microarrays
the signal intensities obtained after hybridization of samples from zebrafish fins and organs to microarrays, ranged from  <dig> to ~ <dig>  fluorescence units. differential expression changes were then calculated by comparing vhsv-infected versus non-infected samples. of the  <dig> oligo sequences present in the zebrafish microarray latest version,  <dig>  or  <dig>  in fins or organs, respectively, showed > 3-fold increases . on the other hand,  <dig> % or  <dig> % in fins or organs, respectively showed a significant departure from the null hypothesis when t-tests were performed at the p <  <dig>  significance level. of the  <dig> immune-related sequences annotated in the zebrafish microarray,  <dig>  in fins and  <dig>  in organs increased > 2-fold with p <  <dig>  after vhsv infection. in contrast,  <dig>  sequences in fins and  <dig>  in organs decreased > 2-fold after vhsv infection .

for each experiment,  <dig> zebrafish were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> ffu of vhsv/ml at 14°c while other  <dig> zebrafish remained non-infected. rna was extracted from the fins or organs 2-days after vhsv or mock infection, labeled with cy <dig> and hybridized to the microarrays. the  <dig> immune-related selected sequences from the 4x <dig> k microarray  from zebrafish were selected and their data analyzed. in each microarray,  <dig> assays of rplp <dig> gene were used for normalization. the mean and p  were then calculated from  <dig> experiments. the transcripts from either fins and/or organs with >2-fold and p <  <dig>  changes were first tabulated and then the rest of the table was completed with their corresponding calculated fold values in organs and/or fins, respectively. fold, expression level in vhsv-infected tissue/expression level in non-infected tissue. +, increased. -, decreased. ~, similar. figure  <dig> shows the representation of the means of all the immune-related genes.

the genes corresponding to the proteins identified in the proteomic analysis were searched in the microarray data and a column with that data added to table  <dig>  because they were present in several copies per microarray, the averages of their differential transcriptional levels were calculated and represented. although some of the increased  and decreased  proteins showed a similar change in their differential transcript levels, the rest of protein changes did not correlate with those of their corresponding transcripts.

many complement transcripts  including those increased in the q-pcr arrays , increased in fins . only the c <dig> transcripts increased in both fins and organs , as confirmed by  <dig> different oligo sequences of the same gene present in the microarray. sequences for the rest of complement related genes  were neither present in the microarray  nor in the q-pcr array . increased c1q transcripts  were only found increased in organs but with p >  <dig>  .

of the  <dig> major histocompatibility complex  sequences present in the annotated immune-related microarray sequences, only those corresponding to the mhc1uaa and mhc1ze genes in fins  were increased. however, most of their lower folds and p >  <dig>  values resulted from their higher folds in only one of the experiments .

previously described up-regulated typical gene markers of viral infection-by-injection, il1b  or tnfa  were found among the genes increased in fins or organs  but with p >  <dig> .

two different oligo sequences from the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  gene detected similarly increased transcripts in the fins but not in organs .

some of the  <dig> transcripts corresponding to immunoglobulin-related genes , specially those corresponding to the heavy chain gene, increased in the fins   and in the organs . among the transcripts increased, those corresponding to the newly described immunoglobulin z, both at the fins  and at the organs  might be relevant to mucosal immunity as could be expected from a natural route of infection.

discussion
major protein changes at the fins after vhsv infection
the differential expression  of fin proteins, identified their most abundant proteins with high variations among experiments . individual fish variation in the development of vhsv infection and on the different amounts of muscle sampled at the bases of the fins , different yields of the fin protein precipitation techniques and 2d-dige technical irreproducibility, all contributed to the wide quantitative differences. nevertheless, some differential abundances of the major protein components could be detected.

for instance, most of the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway were differentially increased . similar enzymes were also found among the cdna library genes from hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit> . in contrast, no enzyme transcripts related to the glycolytic pathway increased in organs after hrv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit>  infection-by-injection, nor in dna vaccination-by-injection with the g gene of hrv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or ihnv  <cit> .

many proteins classified and/or related to the cytoskeleton , vesicle trafficking and/or fin regeneration   <cit>  were differentially expressed . at least some of those might reflect fin regeneration attempts to compensate for their destruction as vhsv infection progresses. similar proteins were also found among the cdna obtained from the hrv-infected leukocytes of the japanese flounder mentioned above  <cit> .

increases of hmgb <dig> protein levels  were detected in vhsv-infected fins. however, their transcript levels were unchanged . similarly, hmgb <dig> transcript profiles after intramuscular injection of the ihnv g gene in trout showed that none of their  <dig> cdnas microarray probes changed  <cit> . nevertheless, transcripts of hmgb <dig> were identified among the hrv-infected leukocytes of japanese flounder  <cit>  and a  <dig> -fold increase of hmgb2-like  <dig> kidney transcripts was found in ihnv-infected trout  . in mammalians, hmgb <dig> is an abundant nuclear protein being secreted upon bacterial infections to enhance tissue repair, attract inflammatory cells, induce chemokines, and activate dendritic cells. all these properties make hmgb <dig> an important intermediate between innate and adaptative responses  <cit>  and a vaccine adjuvant candidate  <cit> . most recently, secreted hmgb <dig> from dendritic cells was demonstrated during dengue viral replication  <cit>  and it has also been tested as a vaccine adjuvant  <cit> . the potential use of hmgb <dig> as an adjuvant for fish vaccines, therefore, might deserve further attention.

the differential expression of some fin proteins  showed a parallel variation in their transcript levels . however, in most of them, the protein differential expression changes did not correlate with their corresponding transcript changes, suggesting that regulation of their expression was not at the transcriptional level, at least in 2-day vhsv-infected fins. although correlation of gene and protein expression levels have been found in some plants  <cit> , most studies found no correlation, including a recent report on individual e. coli cells  <cit> . on the other hand, exclusive post-translational regulation of enzymes of the glycolytic pathway has been reported  <cit> , which could explain some of the data found here. although, similar studies are still scarce, correlation values comparing gene/protein expression levels in several systems were very low  <cit> , and varied with the protein relative abundance and their half-life time. most correlation values showed that mrna might be a poor indicator of protein expression. study of mrna levels, is justified when there is no other way to study gene expression levels, as in the present case where the vhsv immune-related proteins cannot be detected by the proteomic approach.

transcript level changes of immune-related genes at the fins and organs after vhsv infection
the number of the  <dig> immune-related transcripts differentially increased were higher in fins than in organs as estimated by q-pcr. similar results were obtained with the  <dig> immune-related transcripts estimated by microarray hybridization. in contrast, the number of differentially decreased transcripts were higher in organs than in fins . it seems likely that 2-days after infection-by-immersion, vhsv has not yet caused an increased differential response from the internal organs, contrary to what has been described for infection-by-injection in other fish models  <cit> . the lower numbers of increased transcripts seen in organs compared to fins may be due to a delay in virus tissue infiltration. thus, the reason for the major differences seen in transcription may be solely because  <dig> -fold more vhsv was present in fins than in organs. however, if the decreases in transcription are due to the virus, one would expect to see the most significant decreases in fins where the vhsv is more abundant. as an alternative explanation, transcriptions in organs could be inhibited by some soluble viral protein released from the infected fish surfaces. there are not yet any evidences to decide for an explanation of these data.

the differential increased expression obtained in fins indicate that zebrafish responses are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures. low external and therefore low body temperatures in zebrafish can be immunosuppressive, as it has been supported by numerous studies. however, most of those studies demonstrate a delay or inhibition of adaptative immune responses, while at least some innate defenses were increased until the specific immune system adapted  <cit> . thus, cold acclimatized zebrafish fins increased the expression of proteins and transcripts of some immune-related genes after vhsv infection , confirming some previous results on rhabdoviral vaccinated zebrafish  <cit> . however, under the conditions used, most of the organ early responses previously described in infection-by-injection models could not be detected in fins   <cit> , although some of them  were detected in organs . on the other hand, because vhsv  <cit>  or spring viremia carp virus svcv  <cit>  maximal mortalities only occurred at lower than physiological temperatures, there is no other way to study gene responses to rhabdoviral infections. high mortalities at low temperatures could be explained by a more rapid vhsv replication rate in comparison with slower zebrafish defenses, such as it was suggested in the zebrafish/svcv model  <cit> . comparison of the gene expressions between zebrafish/vhsv and zebrafish/svcv models might help to identify new genes, since while mortalities are maximal at similar temperatures   <cit> , optimal svcv in vitro replication occurs at 20-22°c which is closer to the zebrafish optimal temperature. because zebrafish without cold acclimatation was refractory to infection-by-immersion with ihnv  <cit> , vhsv  <cit>  or even with svcv  <cit> , there must exist some temperature-dependent host response mechanism that inhibits rhabdoviral infection and/or their spreading. this temperature-dependence might be of interest for further studies.

increased il <dig> transcripts with >2-fold but p >  <dig> , were found in the fins by both arrays while they were inhibited in organs . il <dig> is produced in mammalian macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells and b lymphocytes in response to intracellular pathogens. il <dig> stimulates tnfa, but no induction of tnfa was observed in fins despite of the presence of induced expression levels of il <dig>  nevertheless, tnfa was the most increased transcript in organs according to the oligo microarray data  but with p >  <dig> . il <dig> has been abundantly described as a viral vaccine adjuvant to increase protective mucosal immunity  <cit> . it has not been tested in fish.

other transcripts only appeared differentially expressed in one of the arrays, such as il <dig> d and il <dig> . both il <dig> and il <dig> are produced by t helper  <dig>  cells  <cit>  to synergistically induce antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  in human keratinocytes  <cit> . at this respect,  <dig> antimicrobial peptides increased in vhsv-infected zebrafish fins and organs, including the hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  <dig>  and the β defensin  genes, the former one with p >  <dig> . increased hamp <dig> had also been detected in turbot by microarray analysis of bacterial  <cit>  and nodavirus  <cit>  infections and in stimulated rts <dig> trout macrophage cell line  <cit> . since, previous findings also implicated defbl <dig> in both rhabdoviral blocking and activation of trout immune defense genes  <cit> , these  <dig> antimicrobial peptides might deserve further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
vhsv, ihnv and svcv natural infections with maximal mortalities occur in salmonids and/or carp after low or changing temperatures in the spring and/or autumn. the results described here demonstrate that, at least zebrafish are not fully immunocompromised at low temperatures. increased fin transcript levels detected by both q-pcr and hybridization arrays corresponded to previously described infection-related genes such as complement components  or class i histocompatibility antigens  and to newly described genes such as secreted immunoglobulin domain , macrophage stimulating factor  and a cluster differentiation antigen . the genes described would contribute to the knowledge of the earliest molecular events occurring in the fish surface tissues at the beginning of natural rhabdoviral infections and/or might be new candidates to be tested as molecular adjuvants for fish vaccines.
