BACKGROUND
bloodstream infections are life-threatening, especially in individuals with serious underlying conditions or an impaired immune system  <cit> . the number of reported cases of bloodstream infections in the usa, between  <dig> and  <dig>  was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and demonstrated an annualized increase of  <dig> %  <cit> . in critically ill patients, the majority of infections are caused by bacteria but fungal infections, although these account for only  <dig> % of all infections, have a significant impact on public health.  <cit> . mixed fungal/bacterial infections are not uncommon, incidences of combined candida and bacterial bloodstream infections have been reported in as many as 23% of all episodes of candidaemia  <cit> . despite its relatively low frequency, fungal blood stream infections can progress to severe sepsis and septic shock, associated with a drastic rise in mortality; therefore, early and appropriate treatment of such infections is critical  <cit> .

since molecular diagnosis in sepsis is reliable, and faster than the classical blood-culturing techniques, there has been an increase in interest in methods such as pcr, ligase chain reaction, nucleic acid sequence based amplification, and nested pcr  <cit> . nevertheless, these molecular approaches are applied only following the positivity of the blood culture; therefore, they require a substantial amount of elapsed time.

in contrast, the lightcycler pcr assay is fast, reliable and relatively easy to perform - even in small laboratories.

this method is based on a previously-reported fluorescence resonance energy transfer  technique which involves a distance-dependent interaction between the electronic excited states of two dye molecules  <cit> . the excitation is transferred from a donor  molecule to an acceptor  molecule, without emission of a photon, and has been proved to be an appropriate method for discriminating between the commonly occurring pathogen g + and g- bacteria  <cit> . the differentiation, via the melting temperature of the overall pcr product and the melting point of the probes, allowed creation subgroups within the g + and g- stains, and this system required less than 4 h, inclusive of the time need for the dna preparation and the evaluation of the pcr results  <cit> . until now, parallel detection of fungal and bacterial infections in a real-time system has been an unresolved problem however there are several tests in the market with the same purpose. some of them detect bacteria, without fungal identification . the reflex pcr assay  includes several steps after the pcr which increases the time required. the sepifast  assay is similar to our system but works with three parallel reaction vessels and a different principle for detection. furthermore, it requires individual molecular laboratory, equipments and software. identification of the most common clinically relevant fungi is possible through a simple melting-point analysis relating to the its <dig>  region. this non-coding region is a highly variable rrna region that is adaptable for the identification of clinically relevant fungi over a broad range  <cit> . measurements are made at 540 nm, and require a non-specific intercalating dye  <cit> .

real-time pcr detection can be performed by using free dyes or labelled sequence-specific probes. one combination of the two techniques uses unlabelled probes for the amplicon detection and tm determination  <cit> . another parallel application was the combination of taqman chemistry and the very new, aspecific dye, boxto, as a multiplex pcr  <cit> .

the novelty of our prototype system lies in the use of non-specific sybr green dye as a donor molecule, instead of a labelled primer or other specific anchor probe. with this technique, it is possible to examine pathogenic fungi, g + and g- bacteria in a single tube multiplex pcr reaction.

RESULTS
discrimination of the fungal, g + and g- bacterial pathogens
dna samples from all species studied were prepared and amplified successfully with the sybr green dye-based method in the lightcycler instrument. species-specific tm-s were obtained by melting-point analysis on three detection channels and all pathogens were identified correctly as fungi or g- or g + bacteria . on the f <dig> channel , the melting points of all the amplicons  were visible, due to the fluorescent signal of the sybr green non-specific intercalating dye. on the f <dig>  and f <dig>  channels, the g- and the g + probes , respectively, gave fluorescence signals. after the discrimination of the g- and g + strains, the fungal pathogens could be screened, because the fungal strains gave no signal on the f2; f <dig> channels.

all the amplicons tm were measured at the f <dig> channel . the signal was generated by aspecific sybrgreen dye. the g + specific probes produced a signal at the f <dig> channel  the g- probes at the f <dig> channel . the signals were induced with the help of a special fret technique.

determination of the bacterial pathogens
four g + and nine g- bacterial subgroups could be distinguished through a joint consideration of the melting points of the probes and the melting point of the overall pcr product .

s. aureus and s. epidermidis have very close-lying melting temperatures and their species-specific differentiation is not possible via this 16s rrna sequence . a comparison of the gene bank sequences  of these species revealed a variance of only three base-pairs, none of them in the region where the probe is associated with the dna. thus, determination of the clinically relevant staphylococcus species requires other gene sequences in which the antibiotic resistance can be detected  <cit> . the situation is the same for the two enterococcus species  <cit> . at the same time, s. pyogenes and l. monocytogenes are clearly differentiable.

among the g- bacteria, e. coli is one of the most common causative agents of bloodstream infections  <cit> . unfortunately, it has almost the same tm as those of e. cloacae and s. marcescens. other bacterial strains, such as h. influenza, are clearly differentiable through the melting temperature of the probe  or amplicon. the sensitivity of the reaction was five colony-forming units  per reaction.

determination of fungal pathogens
fourteen frequently-encountered fungal pathogens could be distinguished. the highly variable its  <dig> target sequence allowed correct identification of all of the clinically relevant fungal strains, through the tm points on the f <dig> channel  <cit> . there was no signal on the f <dig> or f <dig> channel. the sensitivity of the reaction was 5 cfu per reaction.

the correct differentiation between bacteria and fungi was verified by means of gel electrophoresis, with the help of the amplicon length .

determination of the co-infection model
in case of co-infections, there are some limitations in the detection. if the ratios of the different agents are higher than 1: <dig>  the system does not detect the infectious agent which is in lower quantities.

calibration of the multiplex pcr
all three non-specific dyes  excited all of the labelled probes . the best results were obtained with the sybrgreen dye.

the determination of tm is very sensitive to the composition of the pcr reaction mixture, and primarily to the ionic strength. to avoid tm bias originating from pipetting errors between pcr runs, the application of mastermixes is advisable. one limitation of the method is that the various mastermixes offered by different suppliers differ in reagent composition, which may influence the tm values.

naturally, repeated runs with a given mastermix yield reproducible data. in the event of a change of mastermix, however, calibration is necessary to establish the new tm data on the fungal strains.

the data determined in the present work were obtained with the use of “fermentas maxima sybrgreen, no rox” and five-eight parallel experiments. no false positive samples were found when this method was tested. no significant differences in the melting peak temperatures were observed between different isolates of the same species. the standard deviation of the melting peak temperatures of all  <dig> references and  <dig> clinical isolates with bacterial and fungal strains was between  <dig>  and  <dig> , as listed in table  <dig>  these data are in concordance with our previous results  <cit> .

sensitivity and reproducibility
for sensitivity testing of the prototype system, six bacterial and two fungal gdna preparations were made from artificially infected blood. eight species, and eight parallel investigations of five dilutions of the bacterial suspensions in blood were, analysed. of  <dig> reactions for each species, all were positive with  <dig> dna copies,  <dig> % were positive with  <dig> copies,  <dig> % were positive with  <dig> copies and  <dig> % were positive with  <dig> copies . all the reactions were carried out within the same parameters described in the section pcr conditions.

*out of  <dig> samples.

three gram positive, three gram negative and two fungal strains were used for the infection of healthy donor bloods. all the experiments were carried out eight times using  <dig> dilutions of the pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
real-time pcr is one of the fastest diagnostic methods currently available. the use of rrna genes for the detection is based on the conserved 16s rrna sequences of the bacteria. as regards fungi, the its sequence refers to a segment of non-functional rna, situated between  <dig> s and 28s rrnas. to reproduce the results, it is possible to differentiate between fungi and bacteria, or between fungal species by electrophoresis  <cit>  or melting-point analysis  <cit> . the roche lightcycler pcr was specially developed to amplify amplicons under 500 bp. the amplicons amplified by plk1/plk <dig> comprised 187 bp, while the fungal amplicons amplified by its86/its <dig> primer pair varied between 192 bp  and 494 bp , values which are perfectly suited to this instrument profile. in this study, the advantage of the lc system was utilised when fret technique was used to detect and differentiate the bacterial pathogens. as a novel element, excitation of the fluorescent probes was carried out with the help of a non-specific intercalating dye, this is an uncommon procedure in real-time investigations. it allows parallel detection of fungal pathogens and with bacteria in the same tube. as the result of the use of the multiplex pcr in combination with fret probes and melting point-analysis, the broad-range identification of many frequent causative agents of bloodstream infections becomes possible within four hours. sensitivity of pathogen pcr in sepsis is generally between  <dig> and 100 cfu/ml according to the literature  <cit> . the sensitivity of our prototype system was five cfu per reaction, which in combination with an efficient preparation is suitable for the detection of bloodstream infections. if commercially available “midi” preparation kits  were used, the sample mateial was 2 ml of blood, the elution volume was 100 μl and finally 5 μl of eluate were used for subsequent pcr. the calculated sensitivity was 50 cfu/ml blood. the sample/eluent ratio was the same in case of midi and maxi preparation kits which means that increased sample volume is not enhancing the sensitivity  <cit> . the sensitivity of the “gold standard” conventional blood culture technique is one cfu per 10 ml blood sample. our method is less sensitive. the blood culture technique is not replaceable with molecular techniques so far but the time delay until the adequate therapy can be reduce.

to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility of the method, experiments with artificially infected blood were performed. the sensitivity of the pcr was  <dig> to  <dig> copies per reaction, which was the same as with cultivated cells. the melting points  were the same as we described in table  <dig>  with “fermentas maxima sybrgreen, no rox”; therefore, human gdna does not inhibit the reaction and does not modify the melting peaks.

with this method, neither the g + s. aureus and s. epidermidis nor the g- e. coli, e. cloacae and s. marcescens can be distinguished, and additional species-specific probes or primers are necessary for the further differentiation of these species.

antibiotic resistance cannot be determined directly with this prototype system. the susceptibility testing of resistant e. coli strains can be performed using a pcr-based technique with other 16s rrna specific primers  <cit> . unfortunately, these investigations require a pcr analysis after the identification of the bacteria.

in spite of its limitations, the prompt and reliable information provided by this new diagnostic method on the most common pathogenic bacteria might permit targeted therapy with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, instead of empirically-administered broad-spectrum antibiotics. to confirm these findings in clinical practice, a prospective study is now being designed and engineered.

the incidence of sepsis has been continuously increasing over recent decades, and the early detection of the pathogens can have a great impact on the clinical outcome of infections  <cit>  molecular diagnostic systems allow species identification in less than 24 hours - which is a drastic improvement relative to the gold-standard, culture-based method and gram staining-based identification methods that yield results in  <dig> to 72 hours  <cit> .

with the novel method described above , the most common causative agents of bloodstream infections can be detected in two hours, without dna preparation; therefore, this method offers a huge advantage over traditional fret-based assays by accurately detecting the tm of both the probes and the amplicons.
