BACKGROUND
ehrlichia chaffeensis, an obligate, intracellular, tick-borne bacterium that belongs to the family anaplasmataceae, is responsible for an emerging disease in humans called human monocytic ehrlichiosis   <cit> . the transmitting vector of e. chaffeensis, amblyomma americanum, acquires the pathogen during a blood meal from an infected host  <cit> . host cell adaptation and establishment of persistent infection in tick and vertebrate hosts are critical for successful completion of the e. chaffeensis lifecycle and, similarly, for other tick-transmitted rickettsiales of the genera ehrlichia and anaplasma  <cit> . it is necessary for the tick-transmitted pathogens to have evolved strategies that support host cell adaptation and to establish persistent infections. there may be many ways by which the pathogens persist; strategies may include altering the host response  <cit> , varying expressed proteins relative to time post-infection and differential host-specific protein expression  <cit> .

recently, we reported that ehrlichia species alter the expression of many proteins in a host cell-specific manner  <cit> . differentially expressed proteins include outer membrane proteins made from p28-omp multigene locus having  <dig> tandomly arranged paralogous genes of e. chaffeensis  <cit> . the major expression from this locus is limited to a subset of genes and is also influenced by vertebrate and tick cell environment. p28-omp  <dig> protein is the major expressed protein when e. chaffeensis is grown in tick cells, whereas p28-omp  <dig> is expressed predominantly by the organism in macrophages. we also reported that the pathogen originating from tick cells persists longer in a vertebrate host and the host response is significantly different for tick cell-derived bacteria compared with bacteria originating from macrophages  <cit> .

little is known about the promoter structures and transcriptional regulation of e. chaffeensis genes and their contributions to alter the gene expression in response to tick and vertebrate host cell environments. promoter analysis under in vivo conditions is not possible at this time because of a lack of methods to transform e. chaffeensis. in the current study, we report the first description of mapping promoter regions of two host-specific differentially expressed genes of e. chaffeensis.

RESULTS
primer extension analysis of p28-omp genes  <dig> and 19
host-specific differential protein expression from numerous e. chaffeensis genes, including from p28-omp multi-gene locus, has been reported previously  <cit> . to evaluate the gene expression at transcription level, primer extension analysis was performed for p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig> with macrophage and tick cell-derived e. chaffeensis rna . the primer extended products for genes  <dig> and  <dig> were detected in tick cell- and macrophage-derived e. chaffeensis rna, respectively . the analysis also aided in identifying the transcription start sites for genes  <dig> and  <dig> located at  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream to the initiation codons, respectively . the nucleotide at the transcription start sites for both the genes is adenosine.

transcriptional analysis by quantitative rt-pcr at different times post-infection
our previous studies suggested that both p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig> are transcriptionally active in e. chaffeensis originating from vertebrate macrophages and tick cells but the expression levels are different  <cit> . the quantitative gene expression differences for genes  <dig> and  <dig> were determined by taqman-based real-time rt-pcr analysis  . consistent with the previous observations, transcripts for genes  <dig> and  <dig> were detected in rna isolated from both host cell backgrounds. in tick cell-derived e. chaffeensis, p28-omp gene  <dig> expression remained higher than expression of p28-omp gene  <dig> . the gene  <dig> expression in e. chaffeensis also remained high for all time points analyzed post-inoculation in tick cells. in macrophage-derived e. chaffeensis, expression levels were reversed with significantly higher expression for gene  <dig> .

p28-omp  <dig> and  <dig> promoter regions sequence analysis
the entire non-coding sequences upstream to genes  <dig> and  <dig> were evaluated to identify sequences similar to the consensus e. coli rna polymerase binding site sequences, - <dig> and - <dig>  and ribosome binding site sequences  . consensus - <dig> and - <dig> elements were identified and are located few bases upstream to the transcription start sites mapped by primer extension analysis . similarly, putative rbs sequences  <cit>  were identified  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream to the initiation codon of genes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. genes  <dig> and  <dig> sequences upstream to the predicted - <dig> and - <dig> sequences differed considerably in their lengths and homology . the gene  <dig> upstream sequence is  <dig> bp in length, which is  <dig> bp longer than the gene  <dig> upstream sequence . the sequences included several gene-specific direct repeats and palindrome sequences. in addition, a unique  <dig> nucleotide-long 'g' rich sequence was detected in the gene  <dig> sequence. the consensus - <dig> sequence was identical for both the genes, whereas the - <dig> and rbs sequences differed by one nucleotide each . relative distances of the consensus - <dig> and - <dig> sequences from transcription start sites also remained the same for both the genes .

evaluation of promoter activities of the sequences upstream to the coding regions of the p28-omp genes  <dig> and 19
the transcription analysis assessed by direct rna mapping and taqman-based rt-pcr methods revealed quantitative differences in gene expression for p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig>  which is influenced by invertebrate and vertebrate host cell environments. it is unclear how the host cell environments influence the ehrlichia gene expression. promoter analysis of these differentially expressed genes will be valuable for gaining insights about how differential expression is achieved by e. chaffeensis in vertebrate and tick host environments. promoter characterization in vivo for e. chaffeensis is not feasible at this time because genetic manipulation systems are yet to be established. alternatively, characterization of e. chaffeensis promoters may be performed in e. coli or with e. coli rna polymerase as reported for several c. trachomatis genes  <cit> .

to validate the use of e. coli for mapping the promoters of e. chaffeensis genes,in vitro transcription assays were performed for p28-omp  <dig> and  <dig> promoter regions with e. coli rna polymerase by following methods reported for chlamydia species  <cit> . predicted in vitro transcripts, as estimated from transcription start sites mapped by primer extension described previously, were detected only when p28-omp  <dig> and  <dig> complete upstream sequences were ligated to a segment of lacz coding sequence . in vitro transcripts were absent in the reactions that contained the complete gene  <dig> and  <dig> promoter regions ligated in reverse orientation .

upstream sequences for p28-omp genes  <dig> or  <dig> were subsequently evaluated in e. coli. transformants of e. coli containing promoter regions of genes  <dig> and  <dig> cloned in front of the promoterless green fluorescent protein  coding sequence in the pprobe-nt plasmid were positive for green fluorescence as visualized by the presence of green color colonies . e. coli transformed with pprobe-nt plasmids alone were negative for the green fluorescence. the gfp expression was verified by western blot analysis with gfp-specific polyclonal sera . promoter activities for upstream sequences of genes  <dig> and  <dig> were further confirmed by another independent method . the e. coli transformants with plasmids having gene  <dig> or  <dig> sequences cloned in correct orientation had significantly more β-galactosidase activity  than the baseline activity observed for constructs with no promoter sequences or when the sequences were inserted in reverse orientation .

promoter deletion analysis
deletion analyses were performed to assess whether the promoter activities are influenced by the sequences upstream to the transcription start sites of genes  <dig> and 19; β-galactosidase activity for several pblue-topo plasmid constructs with segments deleted from the 5' end for both the genes were evaluated . deletions to the sequences ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp for p28-omp gene  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> bp for gene  <dig>  all deletion constructs for gene  <dig>  except for deletions having  <dig> and  <dig> bp segments, had significantly higher β-galactosidase activity compared with negative controls lacking no insert and the insert in the reverse orientation. the first  <dig> bp deletion from the 5' end resulted in no significant change in β-galactosidase activity compared with that observed for the full-length insert, whereas a deletion of an additional  <dig> bp caused a decline of about 90% of the enzyme activity. the β-galactosidase activity was restored completely by an additional  <dig> bp deletion. further deletion of another  <dig> bp also resulted in another near-complete loss of activity. subsequent deletions of  <dig> bp each caused a stepwise restoration of the enzyme activity to  <dig> and 91%, respectively. deletion of another  <dig> bp caused another drop in β-galactosidase activity to 24%, which remained unaffected with an additional deletion of a  <dig> bp fragment . similar deletion analysis performed for the gene  <dig> upstream sequence also resulted in altered β-galactosidase activity compared with the full-length sequence . the 5' end deletions of  <dig> and  <dig> bp for this gene resulted in a  <dig> and 30% decline, respectively, in enzyme activity. these declines, however, were not statistically significant. deletion of an additional  <dig> bp caused an increase of about 60% more β-galactosidase activity. to confirm that the rna polymerase binding regions are located within the sequences spanning up to the consensus - <dig> sequences, 3' end deletion constructs lacking sequences up to the - <dig> region for genes  <dig> and  <dig>  were prepared and assessed for β-galactosidase activity. these deletions led to the complete loss of β-galactosidase activity .

location of - <dig> and - <dig> regions
to determine whether the consensus - <dig> and - <dig> represented true rna polymerase binding site regions, constructs lacking either the predicted - <dig> or - <dig> alone or the regions spanning from - <dig> to - <dig> were generated, and the effect of the loss of these sequences on promoter activity was evaluated by measuring β-galactosidase activity. deletion of the predicted - <dig> regions alone or in combination with the - <dig> for both the genes resulted in decline of β-galactosidase activity to the background levels observed for negative controls. deletion of the consensus - <dig> region alone for both the genes, however, resulted in no significant change to the promoter activity . the impact of the deletions of - <dig> and - <dig> are very similar for both genes' promoters.

discussion
differences in protein expression influenced by vertebrate and tick cell environment are now well documented for e. chaffeensis  <cit>  and other tick-transmitted bacteria  <cit> . we recently reported novel data describing differences in immune response in the murine host against e. chaffeensis originating from tick cells compared with that observed for the bacteria originating from macrophages  <cit> . importantly, the murine host takes longer to clear the pathogen originating from tick cells, and the delayed clearance has been associated with altered macrophage, b-cell and cytokine responses. these studies suggest that tick cell-specific altered pathogen protein expression offers a selective advantage to e. chaffeensis for its continued survival when it enters into a vertebrate host from the tick cell environment. to date, no studies have assessed the molecular mechanisms used by e. chaffeensis to achieve differential gene expression.

primer extension analysis reported in this study confirmed our previous observations of northern blot analysis that transcripts of p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig> are differentially expressed and as monocistronic messages  <cit> . the primer extension analysis also aided in defining transcription start sites. adenine, the base found at the transcription start site for genes  <dig> and  <dig> of e. chaffeensis, appears to be the most common base at which transcription is initiated from rickettsiales genes, including pathogens of the genera rickettsia and anaplasma  <cit> . our previous studies and those of other investigators also support that genes  <dig> and  <dig> are transcriptionally active independent of e. chaffeensis originating from macrophages or tick cells  <cit> . in the current study, quantitative rt-pcr analysis confirmed the previous observations about the presence of messages for genes  <dig> and  <dig> in both host cell backgrounds. in addition, the analysis aided in mapping quantitative differences in transcription of differentially expressed genes. the quantitative rt-pcr analysis demonstrates that although genes  <dig> and  <dig> are transcriptionally active, levels of transcription are influenced in response to the macrophage and tick cell environments. gene  <dig> is higher in its expression in macrophages, and the opposite is true for gene  <dig> expression.

promoter regions of genes  <dig> and  <dig> differed considerably; the differences include variations in length of the upstream sequences, presence of several gene-specific direct repeats, palindrome sequences and presence of a g-rich region found in gene  <dig>  importance of palindrome and direct repeat sequences in regulating transcription is well established for many prokaryotes and for a rickettsial pathogen  <cit> . for example, the presence of a palindrome sequence in the citrate synthase gene of rickettsia prowazekii with its possible role in transcriptional regulation is reported by cai and winkler  <cit> . similarly, transcription factors such as zinc finger proteins that influence gene expression via interacting with g-rich sequences are established for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . the e. chaffeensis genome contains two homologs of zinc finger proteins   <cit> . it is of interest to investigate whether one or both of these putative e. chaffeensis zinc finger proteins act as transcription regulators for p28-omp gene  <dig> 

mapping the functions of e. chaffeensis genes in vivo cannot be performed because genetic manipulation systems are yet to be established. to overcome this limitation, we assessed the utility of e. coli rna polymerase as a surrogate to characterize e. chaffeensis gene promoters as reported for several c. trachomatis genes  <cit> . in vitro transcription assays performed with e. coli rna polymerase identified the same transcription start sites for p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig> as observed in e. chaffeensis. this observation validates the use of e. coli rna polymerase.

molecular characterization of promoter sequences located upstream to the transcription start sites of genes  <dig> and  <dig> is critical in determining how e. chaffeensis regulates gene expression. in e. coli, expression of reporter gene products, gfp and β-galactosidase, is evident when sequences upstream to the coding regions of p28-omp genes  <dig> and  <dig> were placed in front of promoterless gfp or β-galactosidase genes, respectively. these data are also consistent with previous reports that the e. coli rna polymerase can complement the functions of rickettsial rna polymerases of the genera anaplasma, ehrlichia and rickettsia  <cit> , including recognizing the transcription start sites  <cit> .

sequential deletions in the gene  <dig> upstream sequences from the 5' end, whereby some of the direct repeats and palindrome sequences were deleted, resulted in variations in the promoter activity that fluctuated from complete or partial loss of activity compared with that observed for the full-length upstream sequence. additional deletions caused the restoration of 100% activity, and subsequent additional deletions again led to a decline in promoter activity. similarly, deletion analysis in the gene  <dig> promoter region caused loss or gain of promoter activities relative to the inclusion of full-length upstream sequence as a promoter. these data suggest that promoter regions of genes  <dig> and  <dig> contain sequence domains that influence binding affinity of rna polymerase to the respective promoters. altered promoter activities observed in deletion analysis experiments may have resulted from the deletions of upstream sequences involved in altering dna topology and making rna polymerase less or more accessible to its binding domains. influence of 5' sequences altering the dna topology for rna polymerase binding has been well established for promoters of several bacterial organisms such as bacillus subtilis, c. tracomatis, e. coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae  <cit> . previous reports also suggest that the inverted and direct repeats contribute to the dna curvatures, thus affecting rna polymerase binding to the - <dig> and - <dig> regions  <cit> . although less likely, the presence of e. coli regulators that are homologues of e. chaffeensis may also bind and influence the promoter activity. for example, homologues of r. prowazekii repressors/enhancers in e. coli have been reported for the 16s rrna gene  <cit> . variations in the promoter activity of e. chaffeensis genes observed in e. coli for the deletion constructs may not represent what may occur in the pathogen. defining the importance of the putative regulatory domains of p28-omp genes identified in this study requires further analysis in e. chaffeensis or using e. chaffeensis rna polymerase.

deletion of the consensus - <dig> region alone or in combination with the - <dig> region, but not of the - <dig> region alone, reduced the promoter activity to background levels for both genes  <dig> and  <dig>  these data suggest that, independent of the gene assessed, the - <dig> regions identified contribute to the rna polymerase binding. it is unclear why deletions of the predicted - <dig> regions for both the genes had little effect in altering the promoter functions. greater tolerance to the loss of the - <dig> regions compared to - <dig> regions is reported for other prokaryotes  <cit> . it is, however, possible that the - <dig> regions we predicted are not accurate and may be present at a different location. alternatively, the - <dig> regions may be less important in e. chaffeensis. this hypothesis is too premature at this time; more detailed mapping of the - <dig> regions is needed.

in the absence of genetic manipulation methods, an in vitro transcription system can serve as a useful molecular tool for mapping the molecular basis for differences in e. chaffeensis gene expression. for example, extensive studies have already reported using in vitro transcription systems to map regulation of gene expression for another intra-phagosomal bacterium, c. trachomatis, for which genetic manipulation systems are yet to be established  <cit> . in the current study, we also presented the first evidence for a similar in vitro transcription protocol to drive expression from two e. chaffeensis promoter sequences. more detailed investigations may also be performed by using the in vitro transcription protocol with e. coli or e. chaffeensis rna polymerase, similar to studies carried out for c. trachomatis and r. prowazekii  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed detailed rna analysis to demonstrate that e. chaffeensis regulates transcription by sensing differences in host cell environments. experimental evidence presented in this study also demonstrates that gene expression differences are achieved by altering changes in rna polymerase activity influenced by the sequences located upstream to the transcription start sites. more detailed investigations are needed to map the mechanisms controlling gene expression in e. chaffeensis in different host cell environments.
