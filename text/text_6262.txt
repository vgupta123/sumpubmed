BACKGROUND
superantigens  are microbial proteins with the capacity to activate a large fraction of t cells  <cit> . the cellular receptors for sags are major histocompatibility complex  class ii molecules and t-cell antigen receptors   <cit> . sags can bind to the tcr β subunit and activate t cells independently of their cd <dig> or cd <dig> phenotype when presented by mhc class ii molecules  <cit> . activated t cells secrete a variety of cytokines, such as tnfα, infγ, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . staphylococcal enterotoxin type a  is a protein exotoxin secreted by certain strains of staphylococcus aureus, which was demonstrated to direct cytotoxic t cells  against mhc class ii expressing tumour cells effectively  <cit> . however, mhc class ii positive tumours only represent a minor fraction of the most frequent human tumours. to introduce a novel binding specificity in sea, a monoclonal antibody  specific for colon carcinoma antigen c <dig> was initially conjugated to sea, and the resultant conjugate fab-sea could lyse antigen expressing tumour cells significantly in vitro  <cit> . to date, sea fused to various mab have been subjected to preclinical treatment of many tumour types, some of which have finished phase i or phase ii clinical trials, such as c242fab-sea  and 5t4fabv13sead227a  <cit> .

egfrs are over-expressed in a variety of human tumour cells, including breast, head, neck, gastric, colorectal, oesophageal, prostate, bladder, renal, pancreatic, ovarian and nonsmall cell lung cancer   <cit> . moreover, the degree of egfr over-expression is associated with an advanced tumour stage and resistance to standard therapies  <cit> . egfr-targeted therapies have been proven to be successful by using monoclonal antibodies  or tyrosine kinase inhibitors . unfortunately, not all patients bearing tumours with over-expression of egfr or her <dig> respond to those drugs. only about 10% of nsclc patients responded clinically to gefitinib; somatic mutations within the egfr kinase domain were exclusively observed in lung cancer cells in these patients  <cit> .

human transforming growth factor alpha  is a native ligand co-overexpressed with its receptor egfr in many human tumours  <cit> . htgfα consists of three loops, the third of which  retains binding ability to egfr but lacks mitogenic activity  <cit> . binding of tgfαl <dig> to egfr is not affected by mutations in the egfr kinase domain, which suggests a function for tgfαl <dig> as a targeting molecule, where ligand/receptor induced internalisation is not required. moreover, compared to mabs, tgfαl <dig> is presumably less antigenic, thereby maintaining a longer circulating half-life. these properties enable tgfαl <dig> to be an attractive targeting molecule for the superantigens, which function only when presented on the cell surface. however, the binding ability of tgfαl <dig> to its receptor is relatively weaker than that of mabs to antigen. this raises the question whether the affinity of a small peptide is strong enough to bring sags to tumours in vivo. here, we tested this idea by fusing tgfαl <dig> to sea , a mutant of sea defective for mhc-ii  <cit> . encouragingly, we found that the resultant fusion protein tgfαl3sead227a could bind to egfr-expressing tumour cells and exhibited an apparent growth inhibitory effect on the tumour cells, both in vitro and in vivo. t cells likely mediated the inhibitory effect, which was suggested by the significant infiltration of cd8+ and cd4+ t cells in fusion protein-treated tumour tissues.

RESULTS
construction and expression of fusion proteins
to test the effect of tgfαl <dig> fusion on sea  activity, two sets of constructs, pet-22b-tgfαl3sead227a and pet-22b-sead227atgfαl <dig>  were made. these vectors are pet-22b -derived bacterial expression vectors, which drive the expression of fusion protein tgfαl3sead227a, or sead227atgfαl <dig>  respectively . constructs were transformed into e. coli strain bl <dig>  and protein expression was induced by  <dig>  mm iptg. proteins of interest with the expected molecular weight  were observed in total cell pellets . about 55% soluble fusion proteins appeared in the spheroplast when bacteria cells were induced at 22°c . soluble fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant of sonicated bacterial pellets through a ni-nta affinity column. purified proteins were further dialysed against pbs and concentrated by ultrafiltration. coomassie blue staining after sds-page separation showed that both tgfαl3sead227a and sead227atgfαl <dig> were purified to 95% homogeneity .

tgfαl3sead227a promotes splenocyte proliferation and binds to the egfr
to determine the proliferating effect of fusion proteins, mice splenocytes were incubated with tgfαl3sead227a or sead227atgfαl <dig>  rsea, or pha at 37°c for  <dig> hours. as showed in figure 2a, tgfαl3sead227a maintained  <dig> % of the proliferative activity of rsea. as a control, rsea and pha induced strong proliferation of splenocytes. however, sead227atgfαl <dig> showed only  <dig> % of the proliferative activity of rsea, implying that the tgfαl <dig> c-terminal fusion negatively affects sead227a's activity.

to investigate whether fusion proteins efficiently bind to egfr, a <dig> cells that were derived from a human epidermoid carcinoma characterised by high levels of egfr expression, were incubated with different concentrations of 6his-tagged tgfαl3sead227a or sead227atgfαl <dig>  or rsea . the cells were then incubated with anti-6his tag antibody followed by hrp conjugated anti-mouse igg. the results showed that both tgfαl3sead227a and sead227atgfαl <dig> bind to a <dig> cells with a similar affinity. as a control, rsea did not bind to a <dig> cells . similar results were also obtained through immunostaining of recombinant proteins via anti-6his antibody. tgfαl3sead227a predominantly localised to the cell surface, as seen by fluorescent staining . unexpectedly, there was some punctate staining in the cytoplasm, which seems inconsistent with the previous report that tgfαl <dig> is not mitogenic  <cit> . there are two possible explanations: first, the fusion protein could be imported into cells via an unknown mechanism; second, it is artificial staining caused by fixation or nonspecific binding.

although both tgfαl3sead227a and sead227atgfαl <dig> bind to egfr more efficiently than rsea, we still cannot rule out the possibility that the binding of the fusion protein to egfr-expressing cells may not be mediated by egfr but by other membrane proteins. to exclude this possibility, we conducted a ligand competition assay. as showed in figure 2d, the binding of the fusion protein to a <dig> cells can be efficiently blocked by the addition of egf, which binds exclusively to egfr. this result strongly suggests that the binding of the fusion protein to a <dig> cells is mediated by its specific interaction with egfr.

tgfαl3sead227a inhibited tumour cell growth in vitro
because tgfαl3sead227a has stronger proliferating activity than sead227atgfαl <dig>  we focused our interest on the activity of tgfαl3sead227a. to test whether tgfαl3sead227a bridges tumour cells and immune effecter cells together, which then leads to the lysis of tumour cells, a <dig> cells were initially co-cultured with increasing numbers of activated spleen cells in the presence of tgfαl3sead227a. as shown in figure 3a, half inhibition of tumour cell growth by tgfαl3sead227a was achieved when the effector/target  ratio was 30: <dig>  under this e/t ratio, we found that tgfαl3sead227a inhibits a <dig> cell growth in a dose-dependent manner . the third loop of human tgfα and mouse tgfα are highly conserved  . further, murine melanoma b <dig> cells express comparable egfr to that found in a <dig> cells . this evidence suggests that tgfαl3sead227a also affects egfr-expressing mouse tumours. consistent with this hypothesis; the growth of b <dig> cells was remarkably restrained when co-incubated with tgfαl3sead227a .

tgfαl3sead227a inhibited tumour cell growth in vivo
to test whether the peptide tgfαl <dig> can bring sags to tumours in vivo, we evaluated the anti-tumour effect of tgfαl3sead227a in mouse models. c57bl/ <dig> mice were subcutaneously inoculated with b <dig> cells. when the length of tumours exceeded  <dig> mm, tgfαl3sead227a was administrated intraperitoneally four times at one-day intervals. tumour sizes from each mouse were recorded at the designed intervals. consistent with the in vitro results, we found that all doses of tgfαl3sead227a effectively retarded tumour growth. the maximum tumour growth inhibition percentage was  <dig> %, which was observed in  <dig> pmol of tgfαl3sead227a treated group at the 15th day . as a control, rsea only exerted a marginal effect on tumour growth throughout the therapeutic process .

to investigate the effect of tgfαl3sead227a on mouse survival, we treated mice with  <dig> pmol of fusion drug identically when the tumours' length exceeded  <dig> cm. the survival of mice was checked daily, and the percent survival of the two groups were analysed by kaplan meier plot. throughout the experiment, no deaths were observed in the tgfαl3sead227a group, while only 30% of the mice in the pbs control group survived . this data showed that tgfαl3sead227a treatment could significantly increase the survival time for tumour-bearing mice.

tgfαl3sead227a induced immunoresponse against tumour cells
recruitment of antigen-specific lymphocytes to tumour tissue is a major goal in tumour immunotherapy. both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were targeted by colon cancer specific mab conjugated sea, to lyse colon cancer in vivo  <cit> . to investigate whether tgfαl3sead227a inhibited tumour growth in a similar way, we examined for infiltration of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in fusion protein-treated tumour tissue. not surprisingly, both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were observed around the tumour tissues , while recruitment of the same subtype of t cells was almost non-existent in the pbs control group . these results indicated that the tumour inhibitory effect induced by tgfαl3sead227a was, at least partially, attributed to the infiltration of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells.

discussion
the application of sags for tumour therapy has been attempted for decades. the core aim of these applications is to specifically bring sags to tumour cells via various strategies, including tumour specific monoclonal antibody targeted or membrane anchored sags  <cit> . to date, mab targeted superantigens have been successfully applied to several types of tumours, including b lymphocytic leukaemia, neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma  <cit> . two of them are on the way to clinical phase trials, including c242fab-sea   <cit>  and 5t4fabv13sead227a   <cit> . notably, human anti-mouse antibody  responses were observed in these trials, which cause a reduced circulating half-life, thereby limiting their further use  <cit> . therefore, sags targeting molecules with low antigenicity were suggested for the design of the next generation of sags drugs  <cit> .

tumour-related ligand is less antigenic than mabs, and the conjugate composed of ligand and superantigen was presumed to kill one type of tumour  <cit> . however, native ligands are used less in targeting sags to tumours. this is largely due to internalisation induced by the ligand/receptor interaction, which prevents sags from being presented to the surface of tumour cells and activate t cells. to avoid the internalisation triggered by the binding of ligand to receptor, we use a mitogenic defective tgfα3l, instead of full length tgfα, as a targeting molecule for sead227a. nevertheless, the affinity of tgfα3l with egfr is weaker than that of full length tgfα, which raised a concern for its ability to bring superantigen to the tumour in vivo. as shown in this paper, tgfαl3sead227a can inhibit tumour growth in a egfr-dependent way, implying that the affinity of tgfαl <dig> is sufficient for targeting the superantigen to the tumour. meanwhile, we also noticed a decreased therapeutic effect of the fusion protein when a higher dose of fusion protein  was applied. this indicates that high dose treatment may result in increased nonspecific binding which eventually counteracts the tumour inhibitory effect of the fusion protein. the affinity of tgfαl <dig> to tumour should be further improved for better targeting efficiency. despite that, the therapeutic effect of tgfαl3sead227a is still encouraging, especially when the dose was limited to concentrations between  <dig> pmol and  <dig> pmol.

the antigenicity of tgfαl3sead227a is presumably lower than its monoclonal antibody orthologs. to test this hypothesis, the surviving mice in the tgfαl3sead227a treated group  were bled before being sacrificed and elisa was used to detect antibodies against proteins of interest. no detectable titre was found in either high and low doses of tgfαl3sead227a-treated groups . this result showed that the injection procedure for fusion protein in this paper could not induce apparent antibodies against these two proteins. however, we are not sure whether the same result will occur in the case of injection with a higher dose of fusion protein. it was reported that sags, including sea and seb, could act as an adjuvant to enhance humoral immunity via activating antigen specific cd4+ t cells  <cit> . this observation raises the possibility that a higher dose of tgfαl3sead227a may boot the antibody against itself, owing to the adjuvant effect of sea. to this end, we increased the injection dose to  <dig> mg and extended the interval between injections to two weeks. after three intramuscular injections, the titres of antibody against the proteins of interest were determined. as shown in figure 6a, considerable titres of antibodies against both tgfαl3sead227a and rsea were observed. furthermore, the antibody against tgfαl3sead227a can also recognise tgfαl <dig> . these observations confirmed the adjuvant property of sea, indicating the inevitable antigenicity of superantigen macromolecules. therefore, to reduce the antigenicity of sags macromolecules, the optimisation of both drug dose and treatment procedure will be very important when a preclinical trial is designed. recently, it was reported that combinational use of fab-sags fusion proteins with docetaxel not only improved the antitumour efficiency of fab-sags but also reduced the production of anti-sea antibody  <cit> . this finding provides another strategy to eliminate the antigenicity of sags macromolecules.

CONCLUSIONS
the results in this paper showed that human tgfα-derived tgfαl <dig> is capable of directing sags to tumours and exerting an inhibitory effect on tumour growth, which makes tgfαl3sead227a an attractive candidate for immunotherapy on egfr-expressing tumours.
