BACKGROUND
the transcription factor bach <dig>  is a member of the family of proteins harboring a basic region leucine zipper  dna binding domain  <cit> . in addition, bach <dig> possesses a btb domain. both of these domains are involved in forming heterologous protein-protein interactions  <cit> . in mice abundant bach <dig> expression is described in neuronal cells, monocytes, and in the b-cell compartment only before the plasma cell stage  <cit> . the sub-cellular localization of the bach <dig> protein is controlled by the cytoplasmic localization signal present in the bzip domain and a c-terminal nuclear-export signal. bach <dig> is localized in the cytoplasm through its c-terminal nuclear export signal  <cit> . in b-cells, phosphorylation of bach <dig> by the pi3/s <dig> kinase pathway results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of bach <dig>  <cit> . nuclear accumulation of bach <dig> is induced by anticancer drugs with oxidative stress activities and is regulated by small ubiquitin like modifier- <dig> or by sumoylation  <cit> . bach <dig> nuclear foci are observed to be associated with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies in apoptosis  <cit> .

bach <dig> proteins function as transcriptional repressors and form heterodimers with small maf oncoproteins . such heterodimers bind to the maf recognition elements  <cit> . as an example, bach <dig> negatively regulates the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene by binding to the maf recognition element in the 3'-enhancer  <cit> . besides, bach <dig> is crucial for the programming of antibody class switching and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes  <cit> . several lines of evidence show that bach <dig> is a b-cell specific tumor suppressor. for example, in non hodgkin's lymphoma, a relatively high frequency of loss of heterozygosity was detected for bach <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the bach <dig> expression level has proven to be a useful marker to predict disease-free and overall survival of patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, where a favorable prognosis is correlated with a high expression level of bach <dig>  <cit> . in consistence with its role as a putative tumor suppressor, bach <dig> was found to induce apoptosis in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . over-expression of bach <dig> increased cellular toxicity of anticancer drugs that generate reactive oxygen species  <cit> . in the burkitt lymphoma cell line raji, loss of bach <dig> expression at both the mrna and protein levels was attributed to epstein-barr virus  genome integration into the host bach <dig> gene  <cit> . the enforced expression of bach <dig> in the raji cell line led to a marked reduction of clonogenity  <cit> . moreover, bach <dig> was seen down-regulated in proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, which were in vitro transformed by ebv from resting b-cells  <cit> . these findings suggest that loss or down-regulation of bach <dig> expression may contribute to b-cell lymphomagenesis.

proviral insertional mutagenesis plays an important role in lymphomagenesis by non-acutely transforming murine leukemia viruses . by insertion of proviral dna into the host genome, the retrovirus may activate cellular proto-oncogenes, or more rarely repress tumour suppressor genes  <cit> . thus, loci or genes repeatedly found to be targeted in retrovirus-induced tumors most likely play important roles in the disease process. the specific genes that are tagged by a provirus in a given retrovirus-induced tumor depend on virus type as well as on mouse genetic background  <cit> .

in the present study we have examined tumors induced by wild-type and mutants of akv mlv in inbred nmri mice. in these models the tumors are of b-cell lineage with frequent occurrence of plasmacytomas/plasma cell proliferation  <cit> . recently, we proposed that polyclonal immune stimulation and insertional mutagenesis exert dual effects in the process of disease induction in this akv/inbred-nmri model  <cit> . we here describe the bach <dig> locus as a prominent target in mlv induced b-cell lymphogenesis. a cluster of integrations was detected in intron  <dig> of the bach <dig> gene. interestingly, in the same intron we have identified an alternative bach <dig> promoter. we also identified alternatively used bach <dig> terminal exons located within intron  <dig>  utilization of alternative promoter sequences and terminal exons resulted in new bach <dig> mrna subtypes, of which several have coding potential for bach <dig> protein isoforms containing a partial btb protein-protein interaction domain but lacking the bzip dna binding domain. altogether, the presented data show a novel regulatory complexity resulting in the generation of different bach <dig> proteins.

methods
mouse tumors and tissues
tumors used in this study were induced in nmri inbred mice by akv mlv variants from previous and unpublished work  <cit> . in brief, infectious viral particles of akv mlv and derivatives hereof were inoculated into newborn inbred nmri mice. upon diagnosis of lymphomas, the animals were sacrificed and lymphomas were dissected and frozen . tissues from mock-injected or untreated mice served as controls. all animal studies were in accordance with the german animal welfare act. they were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee  of the helmholtz center munich and by the ethical committee of the government of upper bavaria, germany .

genomic dna and total rna isolation and quantification
genomic dna and total rna were isolated from frozen tumors and tissues using dneasy tissue kit  and trizol® reagent , respectively. quantification was performed by a spectrophotometer.

pcr identification and verification of provirus integration sites
genomic dna isolated from the induced tumors was analyzed for provirus integration sites by a splinkerette-based pcr method  <cit>  described in details elsewhere  <cit> . to confirm provirus integrations into the bach <dig> gene, pcr were done on genomic dna from tumors with a gene specific primer and a viral primer. the gene specific primers at different proviral integration sites were designed according to integration site data. viral primers  <dig> or  <dig> were both described previously  <cit> . the pcr was run in a 25-μl volume containing  <dig>  u of taq dna polymerase ,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> ,  <dig>  μl of 10× taq buffer ,  <dig>  mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate , and  <dig> pmol of each primer. the fragments were amplified in a  <dig> thermal cycler  with a touch-down program as follows:  <dig> cycle of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min and then  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 64–55°c for  <dig> s with  <dig> cycle decreasing 1°c, and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 55°c for  <dig> s, and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min, and finally  <dig> cycle of extension at 72°c for  <dig> min.

southern blot analyses
twenty micrograms of genomic dna from each sample was digested with hindiii or ncoi, separated on a  <dig> % agarose gel, transferred to a zeta-probe membrane , and hybridized with 32p labelled bach <dig> specific dna probes or an ecotropic mlv-specific envelope probe . the bach <dig> gene-specific dna probes were pcr products of  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp, amplified with the following primer pairs: probe1; 5'-tctagggttcaggtgggatg-3' and 5'-gcacaagtgctggctaacaa-3'; probe2; 5'-acttcaggctactgcccaga-3' and 5'-cacatggagacggttgtgac-3'. probes were purified from gel bands with gfx columns. the eco-env probe and detailed procedures for blotting and hybridization were described previously  <cit> .

rt-pcr, q-pcr, and sequencing
for generation of rt-pcr templates first-strand cdna was synthesized from  <dig> ng total rna with an oligo dt primer kit  and for experiments comparing oligo dt primed and random-primed cdna synthesis with the revertaid h minus first strand cdna synthesis kit . rt-pcr reactions were performed with the following program:  <dig> cycle of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min and then  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 60°c for  <dig> s and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min, and finally  <dig> cycle of extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. pcr products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with gfx columns before subjected to sequence determination by abi  <dig> biosystems. quantitative real-time rt-pcr  was performed on a mx4000™ multiplex quantitative pcr system  or on a lightcycler . for each reaction, first-strand cdna from  <dig> ng of total rna was used. all reactions were done in triplicates. the amplification efficiencies of bach <dig> amplicons were calculated by the use of standard curve analysis where the q-pcr templates were serial dilutions of purified bach <dig> cdna derived from spleen and tumor tissue. bach <dig> mrna expression levels were normalized to the expression level for tbp . detailed information concerning primer sequences is available upon request.

5'-rapid amplification of cdna end  analyses
the 5' sequences of bach <dig> isoforms were determined by 5' race analyses using smart™ race cdna amplification kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight alterations. briefly, the 5' race-ready cdna was synthesized with  <dig> μg of total rna from the mouse tumor id:99– <dig>  the 5' sequences were then amplified with the forward universal primer mix  and two bach <dig> isofom b specific reverse primers 1e and 1f, respectively. the primer sequences were as follows: 1e, 5'gtggctatgatccagtcaccccgatct-3'; and 1f, 5'-atgagtgttgcacaccgtgaatctcctg-3'. race pcr was performed with the following program:  <dig> cycle of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> min and then  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> s, annealing at 68°c for  <dig> s, and extension at 72°c for  <dig> min, and finally  <dig> cycle of extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. race products were sequenced by means of abi  <dig> biosystems with primers upm, 1e, 1f and another two nested gene-specific primers 1b, 5'-acgcacacacactccacaccctgaaag-3', and 1c, 5'-acacgcacacacactccacaccctgaaa-3', respectively.

cell culture, transfection and immunofluorescence staining
nih 3t <dig> murine fibroblasts and hek 293t human embryonic kidney cell line were cultured at 37°c with 5% co <dig> in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium containing glutamax-i  supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum or foetal bovine serum, respectively, and with  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin. transfections of nih 3t <dig> cells were performed using lipofectamine reagent  following the manufacturer's protocol. hek  <dig> t cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method  <cit>  using  <dig>  μg/cm <dig> dna. forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed by para-formaldehyde, immunostained with anti-flag antibody and with tritc-conjugated secondary antibody, mounted with dapi-mounting solution , and subjected to fluorescence monitoring by epi-fluorescence microscopy.

protein extraction and western blot analyses
protein samples were extracted from frozen tumors or cultured cells  <dig> h post-transfection with lysis buffer ,  <dig> mm nacl, 1% np- <dig>   <dig> % sodium deoxycholate,  <dig> % sds and  <dig> mm pmsf). samples containing  <dig> μg total protein  were resolved on a  <dig> % sds-page gel and electro-transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride  membrane . the membrane was blocked in tbs  containing  <dig> % tween- <dig>  and 5%  fat-free milk. the blot was hybridized for  <dig> h with goat anti-mouse bach <dig> polyclonal antibody against the n-terminus of the bach <dig> protein   in dilution of 1: <dig> in tbs-t containing 5% fat free milk. the blot was washed twice in tbs-t and then incubated with secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase -conjugated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins/hrp  with 1: <dig> dilutions in tbs-t containing 5% fat-free milk. the membrane was washed twice in tbs and subjected to bach <dig> protein detection by ecl plus western blotting detection system  before being exposed to a medical film . the membrane was stripped and re-hybridized with 1: <dig> dilutions of goat polyclonal anti-human beta-actin antibody   for protein loading control. protein samples extracted from transfected cells were analyzed by western blots using anti-flag m <dig> peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody  according to the recommended procedure but using a 1: <dig> dilution of antibody.

RESULTS
identification of  <dig> provirus integrations into the bach <dig> locus
in inbred nmri mice, wild-type and mutants of akv mlv induce tumors of b-cell lineage with frequent occurrence of plasmacytomas/plasma cell proliferation  <cit> . to identify cellular genes involved in the disease process provirus integration sites were mapped in dissected tumors. out of approximately  <dig> identified integration sites  <dig> were by pcr confirmed to map to the bach <dig> locus . since proviral insertion into the host genome is essentially a random event, such a frequent observation of proviruses within the bach <dig> locus strongly supports a role in lymphomagenesis of the bach <dig> gene. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the proviruses were integrated in the non-coding region; two were located within the promoter region; six within intron 1; seven within intron 2; and three within intron  <dig>  all but three integrated proviruses were inserted in opposite orientation relative to the transcriptional orientation of bach <dig> 

athe virus variants originated from our published  <cit>  or unpublished pathogenicity work. bthe virus was transcribed in the same  or opposite  orientation compared to that of the mouse bach <dig> gene. cprovirus was detectable  or undetectable  by pcr. dsouthern blots showed the proviral integration to be present in a minor fraction of cells in tumor tissue . n.d., not determined.

in order to clarify if the identified provirus integrations were present in a large fraction of cells in their respective tumors, we performed southern blot analyses on tumor genomic dna. we did not observe any rearrangement of genomic dna, corresponding to provirus integrations, using bach <dig> gene specific probes . rehybridization with a provirus-specific ecotropic envelope probe confirmed this observation, since no hybridizing fragments were detected . tissues from balb/c mice containing a single endogenous ecotropic provirus were used as positive controls . together this indicated that only a minor proportion of the cells contained the actual proviral integration in end-stage tumor tissue.

examination of the bach <dig> mrna expression level in tumors
to estimate bach <dig> expression levels in tumors quantitative real-time rt-pcr  was carried out on cdna from tumors with provirus insertion in the bach <dig> locus. as controls, tumors with no bach <dig> locus integration were included together with normal spleen tissue. using a primer combination spanning bach <dig> exons  <dig> to  <dig> we observed no significant difference in the bach <dig> expression level between the two types of tumor cohorts . we notice a lower level of bach <dig> mrna expression in all tumor samples compared to the normal spleen control . using a primer pair covering exons  <dig> to  <dig>  we noticed the same tendency, except for tumor  <dig>  which displayed a marked increase in bach <dig> mrna expression, compared to that of the other tumor samples and normal spleen . the discrepancy between the results obtained for the different primer combinations for this particular tumor sample led us to proceed with other primer combinations. also for primer combinations spanning bach <dig> exons  <dig> to  <dig>  and exons  <dig> to  <dig>  an up-regulation of bach <dig> expression in tumor  <dig> was evident as compared to the other tumor samples. thus, in tumor  <dig>  a preferential up-regulation of bach <dig> transcripts including exon sequences spanning exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> was observed. western blot analyses were carried out with a polyclonal antibody identifying the n-terminus of the bach <dig> protein encoded by exon  <dig>  we detected an even expression level of a 110-kda protein, corresponding to the expected size of bach <dig> protein  <cit> , in tumors from mouse  <dig> and other tumors .

identification of an alternative bach <dig> promoter
the observation of an increased bach <dig> mrna expression level specifically for exon sequences located downstream of exon  <dig> in tumors from mouse  <dig> let us hypothesize that this was due to activation of alternative promoter sequences present within intron  <dig> of the bach <dig> gene. such promoter sequences would result in the generation of a novel first exon if appropriate splice donor sequences were present or alternatively in a continuous 5'-extension to exon  <dig>  it should be noted that the transcriptional orientation of the provirus in tumor  <dig> was opposite to that of bach <dig>  thus minimizing the possibility that the virus directly contributed such an alternative promoter.

in a first attempt to address the nature of a possible alternative bach <dig> promoter we searched for indicative ests. one spliced est sequence, ak <dig>  was identified which could have origin in the usage of a bach <dig> intron  <dig> located promoter. by rt-pcr analysis we verified the existence of the rna corresponding to the est . the first exon of the est was denoted exon 2a. by usage of different primer combinations in various rt-pcr analyses, splicing from exon 2a to exon  <dig> was identified. however, no up-regulation of this transcript was observed in material from tumor  <dig> compared to other tumors and normal spleen . thus, the promoter sequence in front of exon 2a seems not to be the target for the observed bach <dig> deregulation in tumor  <dig> 

in a further search for alternative promoter sequences within intron  <dig>  the possibility of a continuous 5'-extension of exon  <dig> was examined. by rt-pcr analysis using mesenteric lymphoma rna from mouse  <dig> we could by the use of a reverse primer located within exon  <dig> and a forward primer located immediately upstream of exon  <dig>   detect a band corresponding to a transcript including bach <dig> intron <dig> sequences as a novel exon . this was further substantiated by using a forward primer, 10f, located  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig> which also resulted in a pcr product corresponding to a bach <dig> mrna species including intron  <dig> sequences .

in order to determine the 5' end of this novel mrna subtype, we performed 5' race analysis on the mesenteric lymphoma rna from mouse  <dig> using either reverse primer 1e or 1f located upstream from exon  <dig> . two distinct 5' ends of mrnas were identified, located  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of exon  <dig>  respectively . we have found no evidence of the existence of splice donor sequences in the region between the alternative promoter sequences and exon  <dig>  suggesting that the resulting transcripts indeed included a continuous 5'-extension to exon  <dig>  the corresponding novel alternative first bach <dig> exon was denoted e3l. no consensus tata-box was present within the proximal promoter sequence. as translation of bach <dig> initiates in exon  <dig>  inclusion of e3l does not affect the bach <dig> coding region. moreover, no additional open reading frames were detected within the e3l sequences.

to examine if the alternative bach <dig> promoter was active only in tumor  <dig> material, we screened rna from several tumors for the presence of such an alternative bach <dig> transcript. by rt-pcr using forward primer 10f in combination with primer 2r we identified a  <dig> bp band in all examined tumors and in normal spleen corresponding to the bach <dig> transcript including exon e3l . thus, the alternative promoter appears active both in tumor tissue and in normal spleen. albeit semi-quantitative, the assay also pointed at an up-regulation of alternative bach <dig> promoter in tumor  <dig> as compared to the other examined tissue samples.

to further analyze the expression level from the alternative bach <dig> promoter, q-pcr assay was done using primers 2f and 2r . this assay showed a 134-fold higher expression level of the bach <dig> transcript resulting from the alternative promoter within mesenteric lymphoma from mouse  <dig>  when compared to the average expression level in the other examined tumors and in normal spleen . thus, the alternative bach <dig> promoter was highly activated in tumor  <dig>  the amount of bach <dig> transcripts derived from the alternative promoter was similar in all types of tumor tissues examined from mouse  <dig> .

activity comparison between the alternative and normal bach <dig> promoters
to examine the relative amount of bach <dig> transcripts derived from the alternative promoter compared to the normal promoter we used a q-pcr based assay. cdna representing the bach <dig> transcript derived from the normal promoter was amplified using primer pairs in exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  and cdna representing the bach <dig> transcript from the alternative promoter was amplified using a primer located in exon 3l immediately upstream of the beginning of exon  <dig>  and an exon  <dig> primer . the amplification efficiency for the two bach <dig> amplicons was determined to be equivalent  as estimated from q-pcr reactions performed on serial dilutions on purified cdna representing the two bach <dig> transcripts . q-pcr analyses were performed on cdna from tumor  <dig> and from normal spleen and both random primed and oligo dt primed cdna was examined to account for bias in cdna synthesis reactions . in cdna synthesised from tumor  <dig> mrna the amount of the two types of bach <dig> cdna was comparable . this similarity in expression levels was observed both in random-primed and oligo dt primed cdna . in normal spleen the level of the bach <dig> cdna derived from the normal promoter was comparable with the cdna level in tumor  <dig> whereas the amount of the alternative promoter derived bach <dig> cdna was present in a low amount .

we next examined the tissue specificity of the alternative bach <dig> promoter relative to that of the normal promoter. rna representing ten types of organs from mice not infected with retrovirus was examined by q-pcr using primer pairs amplifying sequences representing the two bach <dig> transcripts as described above. as seen in figure  <dig>  transcripts originating from both the alternative and the normal promoters were more abundant in hematopoietic tissues, for example thymus, spleen, and bone marrow, compared with that in other tissues such as kidney, heart, lung, or skeleton muscles. interestingly, in brain and testis, the alternative promoter tends to be utilized relatively more than the normal promoter as compared to the hematopoietic tissues . we note that in none of the examined tissues the alternative bach <dig> promoter seemed to be the major source of bach <dig> transcripts.

alternative usage of bach <dig> terminal exons
the identification of the alternative bach <dig> mrna isoforms described above points to a transcriptional complexity of the bach <dig> locus. to address this further we by in silico analysis searched for est sequences representing other alternative bach <dig> exons. several such putative exons were identified and illustrated in figure  <dig>  the ests bc <dig> and ak <dig> are indicative of the presence of two novel alternative bach <dig> exons spliced to the exon  <dig>  these two exons are denoted exon 5a and exon 5b. exon 5a  contains a consensus poly-a signal, and the corresponding est sequence includes a poly-a tail. thus, the inclusion of exon 5a in the bach <dig> transcript appears to generate a transcript in which exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> are skipped. the existence of bach <dig> mrnas containing exon 5a was verified by rt-pcr and sequencing of tumor material from mouse  <dig> . also the existence of a spliced transcript including exon  <dig>  exon  <dig>  and exon 5a was identified in tumor  <dig> material . we have not been able to detect bach <dig> mrna containing exon 5a in any tumor samples except  <dig>  or in normal spleen tissue . a stop codon is present in exon 5a in frame with the bach <dig> start codon located in exon  <dig> 

the existence of bach <dig> mrnas including exon 5b  was verified by rt-pcr and sequencing of tumor material from mouse  <dig> . again, we were not able to detect mrna containing exon 5b in other tumor samples than tumor  <dig>  or in normal spleen tissue . the 3'-end of the exon 5b sequence derived from est ak <dig> includes no poly-a signal, and therefore might be protruded to the polyadenylation signal located for exon 4a. we note a distance of  <dig> kb between the poly-a site of exon 5a and the 3'-end of the est sequence of exon 5b, and accordingly we have not been able to determine if exon 5b indeed is extended to the same polyadenylation signal as exon 5a . we also note that we have been unable to detect splicing between exon 5b and downstream bach <dig> exons by rt-pcr. a stop codon is present in exon 5b in frame with the bach <dig> start codon located in exon  <dig>  according to the rules of non-sense mediated decay splicing of exon 5b to exon  <dig> will generate a substrate for degradation supporting that exon 5b in itself contains a polyadenylation signal.

from the rt-pcr analyses, it was evident that still another alternative exon sequence exists. this exon, denoted exon  <dig> l, results from the absence of splicing between exon  <dig> and exon 5b and accordingly have a termination similar to exon 5b . bach <dig> transcripts including this exon  <dig> l was detected in tumor  <dig> material as well as in other tumor samples, and also in normal mouse spleen . splicing between exons  <dig> l and  <dig> l, as well as between exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> l was detected by rt-pcr, and thus both the normal and the here identified alternative bach <dig> promoter may generate bach <dig> transcripts including exon  <dig> l.

inclusion of alternative bach <dig> terminal exons results in generation of novel bach <dig> protein isoforms
the inclusion of exon 5a, 5b, or  <dig> l in the bach <dig> transcript results in the generation of c-terminally truncated bach <dig> orfs, which lack the b-zip dna binding domain. the coding regions in common share the n-terminal part of the bach <dig> btb domain encoded by exon  <dig>  this segment constitutes the major part of the btb domain . inclusion of exon 5a or exon 5b in the bach <dig> transcript results in the generation of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids bach <dig> orfs, respectively, in which the first  <dig> amino acids are identical. inclusion of exon  <dig> l results in the generation of a  <dig> amino acids orf in which the first  <dig> amino acids are identical to the bach <dig> isoform encoded from exon 5b .

the canonical bach <dig> protein is localized in the cytoplasm by its c-terminal cytoplasmic localization signal and nuclear-export signal  <cit> . to determine the localization of the alternative bach <dig> protein isoforms, we cloned the orfs of the  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid variants in the mammalian psg5flag expression vector, which accordingly was used to express the bach <dig> proteins in nih 3t <dig> cells or hek  <dig> t cells as flag tagged fusion proteins. immunofluorescence analysis showed that both proteins were nuclear-excluded . instead a peri-nuclear localization was observed . no difference in the localization of the  <dig> amino acid and  <dig> amino acid bach <dig> protein isoforms was evident. thus, the addition of the c-terminal extension in the  <dig> aa bach <dig> isoform had no clear consequence on localization. the integrity of the expressed bach <dig> proteins was confirmed by western blotting . in conclusion, transcription from the bach <dig> locus directs expression of alternative protein isoforms with the same subcellular localization but different composition of functional domains.

discussion
we here report proviral integration into the bach <dig> gene in  <dig> independent b-cell lineage tumors induced by akv or akv derived mlv in nmri mice. proviral integration was identified and confirmed by pcr analysis and sequencing. all cases of proviral insertion were located in intron sequences upstream of the translational start codon of the canonical bach <dig> mrna or within the bach <dig> promoter region and most of the integrations were in the opposite transcriptional orientation to that of the bach <dig> gene. thus, our analyses support previous findings of bach <dig> locus being a common integration site . fourteen bach <dig> integrations are reported in the retrovirus tagged cancer gene database   <cit> , thirteen of which originate from akv induced malignancies in mouse strains of akxd and nfs  <cit> . the distribution pattern of these  <dig> integrations shows remarkable similarity to what we have demonstrated in the present study: they all are b-cell-related, located in non-coding sequences from the promoter region to intron  <dig>  and predominantly having an inverse orientation. the frequency of targeting specific genes depends on both the mouse host strain and the type of retrovirus. in one mouse strain different types of malignancy can be induced by different retroviruses. for example, in nmri mice akv and sl3- <dig> mlvs induce b- and t-cell lymphomas, respectively  <cit> . the same retrovirus may also behave diversely in various host strains. for example, the icsbp gene is an akv-related target in nmri mice, but not in other mouse strains such as akr, akxd, and nfs  <cit> . bach <dig> seems to be a target gene in a variety of host genetic backgrounds for akv induced b-cell malignancies. besides the thirteen akv mlv integration sites, rtcgd contains one moloney mlv integration site within in the bach <dig> gene, which is derived from a brain tumor in the mutated c57bl/ <dig> ) strain  <cit> . this integration site is located at intron  <dig>  and accordingly disrupting the coding sequences. notably, in humans, bach <dig> was also identified to be recurrently integrated by hiv in human cd4+ t cells  <cit> . these integrations were all in intron  <dig> and had all same transcriptional orientation as the bach <dig> gene.

by southern blot analysis using an ecotropic envelope probe and bach <dig> gene specific probes, we analyzed clonality of the b-lymphomagenic tumors induced by akv and akv derived mlv in inbred nmri mice. by this approach we have not been able to detect the virus integration within the tumor in accordance with only a small fraction of the tumor cells having the actual integration. such a southern blot pattern resembles what we have described in a previous report for akv mlv derivates in the nmri mouse strain  <cit> . a model for this observation could be that b-cell lymphoma induction by akv mlv in the inbred nmri mouse strain may involve immune stimulation  <cit> . such stimulation may cause an initial polyclonal stimulation followed by multiple events of mutagenesis by proviral insertion. given that only a minor fraction of the tumor cells harbours the proviral integration, it may not be surprising that in most cases we were unable to detect bach <dig> transcriptional deregulation. still, in tumors from mouse  <dig> transcriptional upregulation of bach <dig> was detected. this upregulation was however only observed for exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> sequences, and accordingly pointed to activation of an alternative bach <dig> promoter located in intron  <dig>  indeed, we were able to identify such a novel bach <dig> promoter and in accordance with the expression data we observed increased expression within tumor material from mouse  <dig>  moreover, we found that in tumor  <dig> material the expression level of the bach <dig> transcript derived from the alternative promoter was similar to the expression level the bach <dig> transcript driven from the normal promoter.

interestingly, the alternative bach <dig> promoter was also identified to be active in normal mouse tissues and accordingly could play a role in the normal regulation of bach <dig> expression. the tissue specificity of the two bach <dig> promoters was overlapping, but we note that the alternative promoter in some non-hematopoietic tissues had an increased relative expression indicating that the contribution to the overall bach <dig> mrna level could be of physiological importance in such tissues. we did not observe normal tissues in which the alternative promoter derived bach <dig> transcript was expressed at a higher level than the normal bach <dig> transcript, but the results point out that transcription directed from this alternative bach <dig> promoter is important to include in future expression analysis addressing bach <dig>  usage of the intron  <dig> promoter will if the transcript is spliced from exon  <dig> l to exons  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> result in generation of the normal bach <dig> protein, as the start codon is located in exon  <dig>  the identification of proviral integrations also in the normal promoter region of bach <dig> and in intron  <dig> supports that upregulation of the canonical bach <dig> protein is involved in mlv-induced tumorgenesis.

our rt-pcr analysis showed that besides the usage of alternative promoter sequences bach <dig> gene regulation also involves alternative usage of terminal exons. such terminal exons were identified in intron  <dig> of the bach <dig> gene. the inclusion of alternative terminal exons resulted in the skipping of exons  <dig> to  <dig> from the bach <dig> transcript. transcripts arising from both the normal bach <dig> promoter and from the novel bach <dig> promoter were identified to include such alternative terminal exons and the resulting transcripts have coding potential for novel subtypes of bach <dig> protein having c-terminal truncations and inclusion of new amino acid compositions. the canonical bach <dig> protein consists of both a btb domain at the n-terminus and a bzip domain near the c-terminus. all of the deduced proteins for these isoforms possess a fragment of the btb domain but lack the bzip domain. the btb domain, also known as the poz  domain, was originally identified as a conserved motif in the drosophila proteins bric à brac, tramtrack and broad-complex  <cit> . the btb domain is involved in a variety of cellular functions, including transcription repression  <cit> , cytoskeleton regulation  <cit> , and targeting protein for ubiquitination/degradation  <cit> . the btb domains from the btb-bzip proteins  are of an elongated form , containing an additional amino-terminal region to the highly conserved btb core region which consists of  <dig> residues  <cit> . as protein-protein interaction domains, the btb domains are involved in forming homo- and hetero-dimerization, as well as protein oligomerization, with a specificity depending on their amino-acid sequences and structure . note the btb domain was shown not to be required for the interaction between bach <dig> and b-cell lymphoma  <dig>  proteins in vitro  <cit> . although the btb sequences included in the hereby identified novel short bach <dig> protein isoforms are truncated compared to the btb domain in normal bach <dig>  they share the amino-terminal region which was predicted to confer stable dimerization  <cit> . we propose that these alternative proteins may play roles distinct to normal bach <dig> either independently or by forming competitive protein interactions in for example the b-cell compartment with normal bach <dig> protein. the involvement of such small bach <dig> proteins in tumorgenesis is also an interesting possibility as they could have a dominant negative effect on normal bach <dig> functions through formation of protein-protein interactions but generating protein complexes that lack the dna binding domain normally contributed by bach <dig>  in light of the fact that bach <dig> is not expressed in the plasma cell stage, bach <dig> proteins most probably play their part in upstream steps of the tumorgenesis. functional analyses of alternative bach <dig> transcripts and proteins are in progress to further elucidate this issue and clarify the importance for normal cellular regulation as well as b-cell lymphomagenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the common insertion of proviruses at the bach <dig> locus in a murine model of b-lymphomagenesis provides strong evidence that mutation at this locus plays a role in the disease. in this work we have identified an alternative promoter and new protein isoforms of bach <dig> and our data imply that activation of an alternative promoter by proviral integration serves as a possible mechanism of up-regulation of the bach <dig> gene with a potential role in b-cell lymphomagenesis. such differential expression of protein isoforms with distinct functions may explain why the bach <dig> gene, previously suggested to be a tumor suppressor may be up-regulated in b-cell lymphomas. the finding of novel bach <dig> transcripts and protein isoforms will facilitate a better insight into the normal and pathophysiological regulation of the bach <dig> gene.
