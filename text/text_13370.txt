BACKGROUND
the structure of insulin, its receptor and the post-receptor signaling pathways have been highly conserved during evolution. both insulin and its receptor are similar in insects, mollusks and man  <cit> . as noted by ebberink et al.  <cit> , the various phyla have had a polyphyletic origin: i.e., the four major groups - the chordates and vertebrates, the echinoderms and tentaculates, the coelenterates, and the mollusks, worms, and arthropods - are now considered to have evolved independently of each other. since insulin occurs in at least two main branches of the phylogenetic tree, it was probably present in the archaemetazoa.

insulin and insulin-like growth factors can act at the cell surface of the amphibian oocyte to initiate a cascade of events in preparation for cell division and differentiation , although most studies use x. laevis ovarian follicles from females preinjected with progesterone. we have examined the role of insulin in the release of the prophase block in r. pipiens oocytes, which are excellent experimental material, both because of their large size , and the fact that each female contains 2– <dig> thousand oocytes that can be induced to undergo synchronous meiotic divisions in vitro. intact oocytes can be stripped of all adhering follicle cells and plasma-vitelline membranes can be isolated  <cit>  for ligand binding studies  <cit> . the prophase oocyte maintains a sizeable pool of high energy phosphate compounds, including phosphocreatine , atp and serine-rich phosphoproteins, for at least 24 h during superfusion in vitro. changes in cell surface area are monitored using voltage clamp techniques  <cit> . superfusion of isolated oocytes or follicles in an nmr tube maintains physiological oxygen levels and allows analysis of changes in bioenergetics, intracellular cation levels and in membrane conductance .

we have examined the cascade of insulin-induced plasma membrane events in order to characterize both the insulin receptor and the membrane enzyme systems modulated by insulin during the first meiotic division. we find that when insulin binds to the plasma membrane receptor of the intact prophase r. pipiens oocyte, increased membrane serine protease activity and ca2+ efflux are seen within minutes. this, in turn, initiates a transient increase in endocytosis , resulting in a 3– <dig> fold increase in electrogenic na+-pump sites, generating a large and sustained na+ free energy gradient across the plasma membrane. this gradient is coupled to a number of secondary transporters that employ the downhill flow of na+ to power the uphill flow of another ion and/or nutrient.  the chemical species move in opposite directions. in symporters  the two species move in the same direction). secondary transporters are ancient molecular machines, common in bacteria and archaea as well as in eukaryotes, and which probably preceded the insulin transduction system . an increase in intracellular ph occurs over the next several hrs, followed by nuclear membrane breakdown by 8–10 h. continuation of the meiotic divisions to second metaphase arrest requires the additional stimulus of progesterone and its polar metabolites.

RESULTS
comparison of mammalian and amphibian insulin and insulin receptor structures
the upper panel of figure  <dig> compares the amino acid sequences of porcine  and xenopus laevis  insulin- <dig>  porcine insulin  is frequently used in biological research and is compared here with peptides native to frogs. using x. laevis insulin- <dig> as an example of frog insulin, the unprocessed insulin sequence as listed in the protein data base  includes a putative signal peptide , the insulin b-chain , c peptide  and the insulin a-chain . the insulin precursor is further processed into a oligotetramer containing two alpha and two beta subunits  <cit> . the align function of the protein knowledgebase compares the amino acids that are associated with the signal peptides , disulfide bridges  and glycosylation sites . the regions in red indicate helices. the symbol  below each amino acid pair in figure  <dig> indicates a commonality at that position whereas  indicates structurally related amino acids.

the lower panel of figure  <dig> compares the alignment of the α-subunits of the x. laevis insulin receptor  with the human insulin receptor .  the insulin receptor sequence depicts the α-subunit represented by the n-terminal  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids of x. laevis and human insulin, respectively. the α-subunit of the insulin receptor contains the insulin binding site . the c-terminal sequence of the unprocessed insulin receptor containing the β-subunit is not shown. in general, based on the position of disulfide bridges, glycosylation sites and amino acid sequence, the structures of both the unprocessed insulin chains and the α-subunit of the insulin receptor have been highly conserved from frog to mammals.

relative contributions of insulin and progesterone to the release of the prophase block
in vertebrates, the ovarian oocyte is blocked in first meiotic prophase and remains so until gonadotropin release prior to ovulation. in amphibians, gonadotropins stimulate oocyte surface epithelial cells to synthesize progesterone  <cit> . progesterone, diffusing from the follicle cells, binds to the α-subunit of the na/k-atpase  <cit>  to release the prophase block. in the frog ovary, meiosis then continues to 2nd meiotic metaphase and the egg undergoes ovulation. fertilization releases the metaphase block and meiosis is completed within 15–20 minutes followed by the mitotic divisions which form the developing blastulae . in r. pipiens, release of the prophase block is associated with a swelling of the large germinal vesicle or nucleus after 6–8 h at 20°c in-vitro. the nucleus rises to the animal pole and pushes aside the black cortical pigment granules, forming a white depigmented region often used as an index for “meiotic maturation”. at 2nd metaphase arrest the first polar body appears as a black spot within the whitish area at the animal pole after 12–15 h .

table  <dig> compares the effect of insulin and progesterone on meiosis in r. pipiens oocytes free of follicle cells . if taken from hibernating females in winter , insulin alone does not induce nuclear membrane breakdown, but by early spring, insulin produces breakdown in about 50–75% of the oocytes, although none continue to 2nd metaphase arrest. for comparison, progesterone alone induced more than 95% of the denuded oocytes to undergo nuclear membrane breakdown in winter and spring; the dose required decreased 100-fold with approaching spring  <cit> . only about 30% of the progesterone-treated oocytes reached 2nd metaphase arrest. as shown in table  <dig>  combining insulin and progesterone produced a maximal  meiotic response by spring. as reported elsewhere, further metabolism of progesterone to one or more polar steroids is necessary for nuclear membrane breakdown  <cit> . polar steroids alone do not induce nuclear membrane breakdown  <cit> .

1incubated in modified ringer’s solution for 24 h at 20–22ºc. experiments were carried out in february-march. values shown are the maximal response.

2mean ± sd .

table  <dig> thus indicates that both insulin and progesterone are essential for completion of the first one and one-half meiotic divisions leading to production of a fertilizable egg. based on these and other studies  the response system in r. pipiens appears to be activated in late spring by release of both insulin and progesterone as the female comes out of hibernation. insulin was first reported to induce nuclear membrane breakdown in isolated x. laevis oocytes in which follicle cells were usually removed by protease treatment  <cit> . insulin-like growth factor  is reported to be 60– <dig> times more potent than insulin in stimulating meiosis although both insulin and igf- <dig> are present in the frog . however, the x. laevis ovary contains follicles in different growth stages and may be acting on oocytes still undergoing growth. furthermore, interpretation of the findings is complicated by the fact that x. laevis females were generally injected with gonadotropin 3–5 days before excising the ovaries. since gonadotropin stimulates progesterone synthesis by amphibian ovarian follicle cells  <cit> , some of the x. laevis studies may have involved an insulin response in progesterone-primed ovarian follicles still in the growth phase.

insulin binding to the oocyte plasma membrane
the vertebrate insulin receptor is thought to bind two insulin molecules on each of two α-subunits . we have incubated follicle cell free  r. pipiens oocytes in ringer’s solution containing 125i]insulin for varying times under physiological conditions, quickly rinsed and removed the plasma-vitelline membranes intact , and measured 125i] in membranes, cytosol and intact oocytes. we previously reported that maximal 125i]insulin binding to the oocyte plasma-vitelline membrane complex occurs within 15 minutes at 20–22°c, although 125i]insulin continues to be taken up into the cytoplasm for at least 2 h  <cit> . an additional constant binding 125i] membrane fraction  <cit>  largely disappeared following transfer of the oocytes to medium containing unlabeled insulin for 15–30 min. the 125i]insulin displaced by unlabeled insulin was recovered in the oocyte cytosol/particulate fractions.

scatchard-type analysis  of the prophase r. pipiens oocyte  indicates a single high affinity insulin binding site with kd =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and a binding capacity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmols/oocyte. assuming a 2: <dig> relationship between insulin and membrane receptor sites, the x-intercept indicates about  <dig>  ×  <dig> sites per oocyte. for an oocyte  <dig>  mm in diameter, there would be a maximum of about  <dig> insulin-binding sites per μm <dig>  no measurable scatchard type insulin binding to plasma-vitelline membranes was found when oocytes were pretreated with inducing levels  of progesterone for 30 min, suggesting that the insulin receptor is internalized following progesterone binding to the na+/k+-atpase α-subunit.

diss and greenstein  <cit>  reported that 125i]insulin displayed sigmoidal binding behavior with x. laevis stage v/vi oocytes after uptake for 1 h at 15° c. they resolved the resulting curvilinear scatchard type plot into two components with kd values of  <dig> ×10-10 m and  <dig> ×10-9 m. the different kd’s may reflect the fact that intact x. laevis oocytes with follicle cells and vitelline membranes removed were used for binding studies. the possible contribution of non-specific endosome/cytosol sequestration was not mentioned.

sequential insulin-induced changes in plasma membrane transport/exchange systems in intact, denuded r. pipiens oocytes
figure  <dig> compares the time course of two transient insulin-induced early membrane-associated events: 1) fluid phase exchange  and 2) 45ca2+ uptake and exchange  <cit> . values are expressed as rate of change , relative to controls in intact denuded sibling oocytes incubated in normal  amphibian ringer’s solution . inulin, a 5000– <dig> molecular weight polysaccharide, is in general not enzymatically degraded or actively transported by cells and is used to measure fluid phase turnover  in isolated cell systems . the simultaneous transient increase in both 14c]inulin and 45ca2+ uptake during the first 10 minutes  indicates an initial insulin-induced increase in plasma membrane recycling.

comparison of 14c]inulin uptake into the oocyte cytosol and isolated plasma-vitelline membranes indicates that 15–20% of the total 14c]inulin taken up during the first 15–30 min was associated with a constant binding fraction in the plasma-vitelline membrane  <cit> . pulse-chase experiments followed by extraction and chromatography of the cytosol and constant binding fractions demonstrated that 14c]inulin was internalized but not bound or metabolized. comparison of membrane-sequestered 125i]insulin with that of 14c]inulin, suggests that the membrane constant binding fraction is contained within the numerous endocytotic vesicles seen in electron micrographs of the fully grown prophase oocyte  <cit> .

figure  <dig> indicates that activation of three plasma membrane transport systems immediately follow the early 45ca2+ and 14c]inulin transients, causing 1) membrane hyperpolarization , 2) 14c]2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake, and 3) increase in intracellular ph . membrane hyperpolarization begans within 5–10 min followed by an increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake and increase in intracellular ph. both glucose uptake and membrane hyperpolariztion approached a new steady-state by 40–60 min. intracellular ph approached a maximal value after about 3 h . the increase in intracellular ph and associated increase in 22na+ influx are blocked by amiloride, indicating that insulin stimulates an amiloride-sensitive na+/h+ exchange system  <cit> .

based on the specific activity of the medium and the inulin uptake into the cytoplasm, it is estimated that a fluid volume of 20–25 nl is internalized per oocyte per hour  <cit> . at a steady-state, this fluid exchange accounts for about 40% of intracellular na+ turnover in the unstimulated  oocyte  <cit> . the observed 2– <dig> fold insulin-induced increase in fluid phase uptake  and na+/ca2+ exchange increased intracellular na+ concentration within the first 15–20 min .

insulin-induced activation of plasma membrane serine protease
figure  <dig> demonstrates that insulin rapidly activates a serine protease in plasma membranes isolated from prophase r. pipiens oocytes. as also shown, the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  inhibited insulin activation of membrane protease. pmsf binds specifically to the active site serine in a serine protease  <cit> . it does not bind to any other serine residue in the protein. inhibition of insulin-induced protease activation occurred only if protease inhibitors  were added prior to insulin. no effect was seen if the inhibitor was added at the same time as insulin, and the inhibitors alone had minimal effect on oocyte membrane potential, phosphocreatine levels, and intracellular ph.

seals and czech  <cit>  were the first to demonstrate that binding of insulin to plasma membranes  activates membrane protease. four protease-activated receptors  have now been identified, one of which  is activated by serine proteases. pars are g-protein-coupled receptors, activated by cleaving an n-terminal sequence . the mechanisms that control par <dig> signaling are not well defined, but once activated, par <dig> undergoes internalization and sorting  <cit>  which may contribute to the transient increase in membrane recycling shown in figure  <dig>  it is interesting to note that endogenous serine proteases induce meiosis in oocytes of the annelid sabellaria and that serine protease inhibitors block meiosis in xenopus and rana oocytes . this suggests that protease activation was an early evolutionary step  <cit>  in meiotic induction and that insulin may have subsequently evolved as a mechanism for fine-tuning release of the prophase block.

insulin-induced electrical and ionic changes at the oocyte plasma membrane
table  <dig> summarizes both insulin- and progesterone-dependent changes in: 1) fluid phase exchange , 2) plasma membrane potential , 3) plasma membrane conductance , 4) 2-deoxyglucose uptake  and 5) intracellular ph  during incubation of prophase oocytes. insulin and progesterone-dependent changes are compared in physiological  ringer’s solution and na+-free ringer’s solution. the bottom line of table  <dig> indicates that preincubation with the serine protease inhibitor, pmsf, blocks all insulin induced membrane events studied: endocytosis, hyperpolarization, increase in phi, and 2-deoxyglucose uptake. of the insulin-induced membrane responses shown, only one, increased phi , also occurred in response to progesterone. another response, membrane conductance, decreased with insulin stimulation, whereas it increased with progesterone stimulation.

extracellular na+ is essential for insulin stimulation of endocytosis , 2-deoxyglucose uptake  and increase in phi . endocytosis increases 2– <dig> fold during the first 20 minutes after exposure to insulin and largely accounts for the initial increase in intracellular na+. an estimate of both membrane surface area  and endocytotic vesicle size   <cit>  indicates that, on average, the oocyte plasma membrane recycles several times an hour. the data in columns  <dig> and  <dig> of table  <dig> indicate that membrane hyperpolarization is na+-dependent and that the negative-going hyperpolarization  is largely due to a marked decrease in na+ conductance. hyperpolarization generally began within 10 min: the potential usually reaches a new steady state within 60–90 min and the oocyte remains hyperpolarized for 4–5 h. in oocytes from  <dig> females, the insulin-induced hyperpolarization was 17 ± 2 mv. these values are typical for denuded oocytes from november through march. by late spring, the resting potential of the denuded prophase oocyte increased to 70–80 mv  and addition of insulin no longer produced hyperpolarization.

the hyperpolarizing effect of insulin is compared in the presence of a na+-channel blocker , a na+ pump inhibitor  and a serine protease inhibitor  in table  <dig>  amiloride mimicked the low na+ medium, producing a 26 mv hyperpolarization that was insensitive to insulin. as also shown, addition of insulin to strophthantidin-treated oocytes produced a 20 mv hyperpolarization. treatment of voltage-clamped prophase oocytes with 10 μm strophanthidin resulted in a rapid  decrease in membrane current without a significant change in membrane conductance . the decrease in conductance in response to insulin is not due to hyperpolarization, per se, since the steady-state conductance of the untreated oocyte increases when voltage-clamped above its resting potential. pretreatment with the serine protease inhibitor pmsf had minimal effect on resting membrane potential but did block insulin-induced hyperpolarization.

from the data shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  oocyte membrane conductance appears largely associated with na+ channels. na+ channels are classified according to the trigger that opens the channel, i.e. either “voltage-gated” or “ligand-gated”  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  oocyte na+ conductance is amiloride sensitive, indicating a non-voltage-sensitive ion channel belonging to the amiloride-sensitive na+ channel  family. regulation of epithelial na+ channel function seems to be achieved through cell surface insertion/retrieval of channels, by changes in channel open probability, or through a combination of these processes . the large α-subunit of the channel associates with one or more accessory subunits  and channel activity is modulated by multiple factors, including proteases . the finding that insulin activates oocyte serine protease  and that a serine protease inhibitor  blocks insulin-induced membrane hyperpolarization  suggests that activation of a serine protease is responsible for na+ channel inactivation and resulting membrane hyperpolarization.

2-deoxyglucose uptake is also na+-dependent . increased uptake follows the transient rise in endocytosis  and correlates with membrane hyperpolarization . na+-dependent glucose transporters, sglts, are a broad class of integral membrane proteins that mediate thermodynamically-coupled transport of sugars and na+ . vera and rosen found  <cit>  that the endogenous x. laevis oocyte glucose transporter was kinetically and immunologically indistinguishable from both brain and liver glucose transporters, known to be insulin responsive. they also found that upon expression, two different insulin-insensitive mammalian glucose transporters became insulin-responsive in the oocyte. this suggests that insulin-sensitivity  is cell-dependent.

the oocyte membrane na+/k+-atpase and na+ channels modulate the na+ free energy gradient
the insulin-induced decreased na+ channel conductance, coupled with a decrease in cytoplasmic free na+ ions  generates a na+ electrochemical potential difference  that can be used as an energy source for the activation of na+/glucose symporter, as well as the 3na+/ca2+  and na+/h+  antiporters. insulin usually stimulates the co-transport of  <dig> na+ ions for each glucose molecule. the ability of sglt’s to accumulate glucose is critically dependent on the stoichiometry of the na+ and glucose fluxes, i.e. i/o = n/exp, where i and o are intracellular and extracellular glucose and na+, respectively, vm is the membrane potential , f is the faraday constant, r is the gas constant, t is the absolute temperature, and n is the coupling coefficient. the vm and i values in table  <dig> indicate that, in oocytes, insulin would stimulate a 20-fold increase in glucose uptake. similar calculations can be made for h+ and ca2+ ions and would explain increased ca2+ and h+ efflux. thus, the insulin effects reported here appear largely due to an increased na+-free energy gradient.

moore first reported that insulin stimulates a na+ and amiloride-sensitive increase in intracellular ph in frog skeletal muscle in vitro <cit> . subsequent studies by vigne et al.  <cit>  failed to confirm the insulin-induced increase in intracellular ph, using myoblasts from 9–12 day old chick embryos. however, vigne et al. incubated myoblasts in medium containing 25 mm hepes-tris at ph  <dig> . passive diffusion and/or fluid phase exchange  may have facilitated uptake of hepes-tris buffer into the myocytes and the increased buffering capacity could have prevented the physiological insulin-induced intracellular ph changes. more recently, yang et al.  <cit>  found that insulin treatment of cadiomyocytes resulted in a marked alkalinization of the cytoplasm as measured using a fluorescent indicator, confirming the earlier findings. yang et al.  <cit>  further found that the alkalinizing effect of insulin was blocked with cariporide, consistent with stimulation of na+/h+ exchange.

effect of insulin on ouabain-binding to the oocyte plasma-vitelline membrane
table  <dig> compares 3h]ouabain binding to denuded oocytes with and without 10 μm insulin for 60 min. isolated denuded oocytes were then incubated with 3h]ouabain and the intact plasma-vitelline membrane complex isolated and counted as described in methods.  based on the scatchard plot for ouabain binding, there are 40– <dig> na+-pump sites per insulin binding site, and in the untreated oocyte, the low affinity ouabain binding sites predominate. in contrast, the insulin-treated oocyte displays a single class of high-affinity ouabain-binding sites and the density of high affinity sites has increased 3- <dig> fold. this is consistent with studies using human embryonic kidney  cells  <cit>  in which insulin stimulated an increase in surface na+-pump α-subunits. the increase in na+-pump α-subunits correlated with an increase in the binding of an antibody that recognizes only the nonphosphorylated form of the α- <dig> subunit .

1means ± sd .

2in the absence of insulin, ouabain binding was biphasic, with high and low affinity sites. in the presence of insulin the low affinity sites disappeared and the binding capacity of high affinity sites increased.

the question therefore arises, what is the nature of the high and low affinity ouabain binding sites? using fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy, stotz et al.,  <cit>  have found that elevated na+ concentrations prevent high affinity ouabain binding to purified porcine kidney na/k-atpase. based on spectrofluorimetry and calorimetric titrations, they propose that when intracellular na+ is elevated, low affinity ouabain binding is induced by binding of a third na+ ion to na+/k+-atpase. they concluded that the cardiac glycoside binds preferentially to the phosphorylated state of the enzyme, and that only conformations with  <dig> or  <dig> bound na+ ions permit high-affinity ouabain binding. subsequently, sandtner et al.  <cit>  found that in x. laevis oocytes, the two ouabain sites are mutually exclusive, with the low affinity site at the cell surface near the ion permeation pathway  <cit>  and the high affinity site deeper within the permeation pathway. the ouabain at the low affinity site has a similar position to that observed by x-ray crystallography  <cit> ; however, the high affinity site is situated deeper within the channel and the lactone ring at c- <dig> faces outwards rather than inwards as indicated by the crystallography data.

these results indicate that ouabain traverses the permeation pathway from the low affinity to the high affinity site. if stotz et al.  <cit>  and sandtner et al.  <cit>  are correct, the high extracellular na+ level at the membrane surface is responsible for maintaining low affinity ouabain binding and that a third na+ is displaced as the ouabain moves down the permeation pathway. we found that insulin causes the disappearance of the low affinity ouabain binding within minutes, suggesting that insulin binding to its receptor results in a conformational change that prevents binding by a third na+ ion and that optimizes formation of the energy transducing ion pump.

topology of the plasma membrane protease-par2-na+ channel transduction system
figure  <dig> compares the topology of four putative plasma membrane peptides that are associated with the insulin-response system of the oocyte plasma membrane: 1) the β-subunit of the insulin receptor , 2) the protease-activated receptor- <dig> , 3) the membrane channel regulating serine protease  and 4) the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel subunit α . the vertical red bars indicate positions of the transmembrane  helices.

the insulin receptor is composed of two α and two β subunits  <cit> ; the β being inserted into the plasma membrane via a single transmembrane helix. each α-subunit  binds two insulin molecules and is, in turn, attached to a β-subunit via s-s bridges. the tmhmm server predicts that each β-subunit of the insulin receptor and the serine protease has a single transmembrane  helix whereas the protease activated receptor  appears to have eight tm helices. a fourth response element, the amiloride-sensitive na+-channel , exhibits  <dig> tm helices, located near the n- and c-terminal ends of the peptide.

in contrast to the tmhmm prediction, memsat- <dig> analysis  <cit>  of par <dig> predicts a  <dig> amino acid n-terminal signal peptide and seven tm helices. the secretory signal peptide is a ubiquitous protein-sorting signal that targets its passenger protein for translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes. many methods have been published for predicting signal peptides from the amino acid sequence , but most have a limited ability to distinguish between signal peptides and n-terminal tm helices . version  <dig>  of signalp, memsat-3/svm and phobius attempt to solve this problem. of these methods signalp v.  <dig>  appears to be the most consistent. signalp v.  <dig>   indicates the presence of a signal peptide cleavage site between positions  <dig> and  <dig>  thus, in agreement with memsat-3/svm, the first putative tm helix is a signal peptide, indicating that par <dig> contains only seven tm helices.

membrane topology of insulin-stimulated transporters in the oocyte plasma membrane transduction system
figure  <dig> compares the topology of three antiporters and one symporter associated with the insulin response in oocytes. the amino acid sequences are those published in the swiss protein database , and, with the exception of sglt <dig>  are those published for a closely related frog, x. laevis. sglt <dig> has not been identified in xenopus, therefore the topology for the human enzyme is shown. from top to bottom the enzymes are: the catalytic α-subunit of na+/k+-atpase , the na+/h+-exchanger , the na+/ca2+-exchanger  and the insulin-regulated glucose-na+ co-transport enzyme .

all  <dig> membrane enzymes are involved in na+ exchange or in co-transport systems. na+/k+-atpase actively exchanges  <dig> na+ for  <dig> k+, contributing to membrane hyperpolarization. the na+/h+ antiporter exchanges  <dig> na+ for each h+ expelled, resulting in an increase in intracellular ph. similarly, the na+/ca2+ exchanger catalyzes a 3: <dig> exchange, often resulting in a small membrane depolarization. finally, the na+/glucose co-transporters take up  <dig> na+ into the cell for every glucose molecule taken up. as in figure  <dig>  the vertical red bars indicate the positions of transmembrane  helices. all four enzymes have multiple tm domains, often in groups or pairs. according to memsat-svm, the na+/ca2+ exchanger has  <dig> tm helices. from top to bottom, the four enzymes exhibit  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> tm helices, respectively.

table  <dig> indicates that, in addition to multiple tm helices, the enzymes shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> contain  <dig> to  <dig> caveolin binding motifs  <cit> . caveolins are a family of 22 kda integral membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. systematic evolutionary analysis shows a conservation of genes encoding three caveolins in metazoans , indicating their evolution was parallel to insulin and its receptor. caveolins contain a helix-turn-helix transmembrane domain  <cit>  and may act as scaffolding proteins within caveolin-rich lipid rafts by compartmentalizing and concentrating signaling peptides bearing a caveolin-binding  motif . using a glutathione-s-transferase -fusion protein containing the “caveolin- <dig> scaffolding domain”  as a receptor to select peptide ligands from a bacteriophage display library, couvet et al.  <cit>  identified two related but distinct cb motifs, ΦxxxxΦxxΦ and ΦxΦxxxxΦ  in most of the proteins that have been shown to interact with caveolin.

1caveolin binding motif is defined as ФxxФxxxxФ or ФxФxxxxФ, where Ф is an aromatic amino acid  and x is any amino acid. see ref.  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig>  two possible cb double motifs can be identified in the na/k-atpase α-subunit; one is present within tm- <dig>  and a second within tm - <dig>  <cit> . tm - <dig> represents a double consensus sequence for a cb motif  to the motif, ΦxxΦxxxxΦxxΦxxxxΦ, whereas tm - <dig> displays the alternative double consensus sequence  to the motif, ΦxΦxxxxΦxxxxΦxΦ. for comparison, the na+/ca2+ exchanger contains  <dig> cb motifs, two overlapping tm- <dig> and a third overlapping tm- <dig>  the na+/h+-exchanger and sglt <dig> contain one cb motif each, within tm- <dig> and tm- <dig>  respectively. the last column of table  <dig> indicates that the β-subunit of the insulin receptor  contains  <dig> cb motifs . however, neither cb motif is associated with the tm helix.

although not shown here, the protease-activated receptor   contains three cb motifs: 46yiytvapf <dig>  308ysdsvytfy <dig>  333yyfvskdf <dig>  the last two cb motifs overlap tm- <dig> and tm- <dig>  respectively. the serine protease  contains one cb motif  that coincides with the c-terminal tm helix. the amiloride-sensitive na+-channel α-subunit  contains one cb motif: 253yssfhhaiy <dig>  the α and β subunits of the insulin receptor contain  <dig> and  <dig> cb motifs, respectively. the presence of cb motifs demonstrates that all nine integral membrane enzymes involved in insulin signaling are potential targets for interaction with caveolins.

role of na+/k+-atpase membrane pools in the meiotic divisions
xie and askari have proposed  <cit>  that the α-subunit of na/k-atpase exists as two functional forms, each having a distinct but coupled function. one is the classical pool in which the enzyme acts as a energy transducing ion pump, and the second is associated with plasma membrane cell signaling systems. liu and askari subsequently found  <cit>  that sealed isolated caveolae from myocytes exhibit active na+ transport and that caveolar membranes contain about 75% of the total na+/k+-atpase activity. studies by liu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the ouabain-sensitive na+/k+-atpase in the two pools have similar properties and equal molar activities, indicating that the caveolar enzyme retains its transport activity and does not contain nonpumping enzyme.

a variety of transport functions are known to depend on the maintenance of na+ and k+ ionic gradients. the minimum functional unit of the na+/k+-atpase is a heteromeric dimer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and a glycosylated β-subunits. four isoforms of the α- subunit  and three isoforms of the β-subunit have been identified  <cit> . an interesting finding has been that insulin induces translocation of α <dig> and β <dig> subunits from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle  <cit> , suggesting that insulin-induced subunit translocation may alter transport and/or signaling functions.

based on: 1) the negative-going membrane hyperpolarization , 2) the 3-fold increase in high-affinity ouabain binding sites , 3) the decrease in intracellular free na+ , and 4) the insulin-initiated membrane recycling, we suggest that insulin-induced na+-pump activation may be due to recycling/recruitment of β and/or α-subunits to specific lipid rafts within the microregions of the plasma membrane. na+-pump activation increases the na+-free energy gradient, which could provide the energy source for the na+:glucose symporter and the na+:ca2+ and na+:h+ antiporters.

possible role of lipid rafts and caveolin- <dig> in receptor-ligand binding
since all proteins involved  contain one or more cb motifs, it is likely that the insulin response system is localized to the caveolin-rich lipid rafts. numerous studies have shown that plasma membrane compartmentalization occurs through lipid-lipid, lipid-protein and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions . to date, two types of structures, planar rafts  and the cholesterol-rich “lipid rafts” within caveolae  have been described  <cit> . lipid rafts are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer; both are estimated to be 25–100 nm in diameter. liu and askari report  <cit>  that caveolar membranes from cardiac myocytes contain about 75% of total myocyte na/k-atpase activity and that sealed, isolated caveolae exhibit active na+ transport. these authors suggest that the caveolar impocketings are the “primary portals for na+ and k+ fluxes”  <cit> , and represent sites where the ion pumping and signaling functions of na/k-atpase are integrated.

sequence analysis of the insulin receptor β-subunit, membrane serine protease, par <dig> and the amiloride-sensitive na+ channel subunit α  , as well as the na+/k+-atpase α-subunit, na+:glucose symporter, na+/ca2+ and na+/h+ antiporters , indicate that all contain caveolin binding  motifs. this implicates the low-density  membrane domains in insulin-mediated signaling associated with prophase block, and suggests that the insulin-induced shift from low affinity to high affinity ouabain binding sites  results from an increase in caveolar  na+-pump sites during the initial transient increase in membrane recycling . a role for lipid rafts in meiosis is further supported by the finding by sadler and jacobs  <cit>  that treatment of xenopus oocytes with the cholesterol-depleting drug, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, removed 50–70% of cell-associated 3h]cholesterol and accelerated the progesterone response. we find that progesterone induces net internalization of 40–50% of the oocyte surface containing >95% of the na+/k+-atpase α-subunit just prior to nuclear membrane breakdown  <cit> , consistent with a loss of membrane caveolin-rich rafts.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here indicate that, under physiological conditions, resumption of meiotic divisions and continuation to second meiotic metaphase arrest requires the action of both insulin and progesterone at caveolar surface receptors. the insulin-induced membrane changes are potentiated by the non-genomic action of progesterone released by follicle cells in response to gonadotropin . as noted in background, insulin evolved very early and occurs in at least two main branches of the phylogenetic tree. studies on the evolutionary pathway of the insulin gene family suggest that insulin and insulin-like growth factor  became distinct molecules only after vertebrates appeared . mcrory and sherwood  <cit>  conclude that insulin and igf maintained separate gene lineages in both vertebrate and prochordate evolution and have a distinct evolutionary history of at least  <dig> million years. steroids, on the other hand, evolved as the atmospheric oxygen content rose to a level sufficient to sustain oxygenase reactions  <cit> . the initial pathway leading to steroid synthesis depends upon anaerobic formation of acetyl-coa via mevalonate and farnesyl pyrophosphate to form squalene. an oxygenase then converts squalene to epoxysqualene using molecular oxygen. molecular oxygen is required for a number of the  <dig> reactions required for processing the cyclization products that lead to cholesterol formation.

current consensus indicates that measurable amounts  of oxygen first appeared in earth’s atmosphere some  <dig>  billion years ago, with a second large increase to about 20% in atmospheric oxygen occurring around  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . primitive vertebrates first appeared about  <dig> million years ago, following a second and much larger increase in atmospheric oxygen. thus, insulin-like peptides evolved about  <dig> billion years ago, followed by the much later appearance of a non-genomic progesterone action coupled to one or more insulin-response systems. the non-genomic action of progesterone  associated with meiosis thus evolved as additional modulator of existing peptide signaling systems and may have preceded the genomic action of steroids at the cell nucleus.

taken in toto, the evidence outlined here suggests that insulin initiates a transient increase in plasma membrane turnover  within the first 5–10 min, resulting in decreased na+ conductance , followed by a shift from the low-affinity to the high-affinity ouabain binding  forms of na/k-atpase . the fact that both the α and β-subunits of the insulin receptor as well as the response system enzymes  contain one or more caveolin binding motifs, indicates that the insulin response system is located in caveolar lipid rafts. in adipocytes the insulin receptor has been localized to plasma membrane caveolae, and is internalized within minutes upon addition of insulin  <cit> . thus, internalization and recycling could account for the selective increase in high affinity ouabain binding sites in the oocyte plasma membrane and could initiate protease activation  with the concomitant loss of na+ channels .

following a rise in circulating insulin as females come out of hibernation in late spring, oocyte membrane hyperpolarization resulting from decreased na+ conductance is the principal driving force for the increase in 2na+/glucose uptake that provides an energy source for meiosis and early cleavage. the increased na+ free energy gradient, in turn, provides the energy for the enhanced 3na+/ca2+ and na+/h+ antiporters, resulting in increased ca2+ efflux and alkalinization of the oocyte cytosol. as indicated by the topology  of the enzyme systems involved , insulin binding to lipid raft sites may initiate a complex sequence of inter- and intramolecular helix-helix interactions to choreograph the sequential changes in plasma membrane ion permeability, transmembrane potential and intracellular ph essential for the meiotic divisions.
