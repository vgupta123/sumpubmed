BACKGROUND
new zealand has a long history of interest in the genus actinidia, being the country which commercialized the fruit of actinidia deliciosa  c.f. liang et a.r. ferguson var. deliciosa, as kiwifruit, and which recently released actinidia chinensis planch. var. chinensis 'hort16a', the gold-fleshed kiwifruit, as an alternative cultivar. while new zealand was instrumental in bringing these fruits to commercial attention, the genus is native to china and neighbouring countries where more than  <dig> species are known. this germplasm is relatively unexplored in terms of horticultural development of new and novel cultivars and offers a huge range of fruit characters and 'eating attributes', and plants suited to a wide range of climatic conditions. the diversity of flavours, fragrances, colours, and health factors are also of interest in genomic studies, offering the possibility of defining chemical pathways and identifying gene function.

actinidia species present challenges to research and breeding. all known species in the genus are dioecious. female plants bear flowers that are hermaphroditic in appearance but produce only empty pollen grains, while male plants have flowers that are unisexual with numerous stamens surrounding a rudimentary pistil whose growth is suppressed before style elongation or ovule initiation. full dioecism is shown by about 4% of seed plants, and a second group display a variety of sub-dioecious conditions  <cit> . genetic studies have shown that dioecy has evolved many times in plants, and have demonstrated a variety of sex-determining systems  <cit> . in actinidia, bulk segregant analysis with random amplified polymorphic dna  markers supported the hypothesis that sex-determining genes were localized in a pair of chromosomes that function like an xx/xy system with male heterogamety  <cit> . the small size  of the chromosomes has made cytological studies difficult with the techniques available, and sex-determining chromosomes have not been positively identified. he et al.  <cit>  using an improved chromosome binding technique, analyzed the karyotypes of diploid a. chinensis at the primary differentiation stage and reported that the sex chromosomes could not be identified from karyotypes of somatic cells. however, when they examined the pachytene stage of pollen mother cell meiosis, all  <dig> pairs of homologous chromosomes of pistillate and staminate plants paired tightly, except for a pair of nucleolar  chromosomes in staminate plants. the two sat-chromosomes were similar in length and shape, but in staminate plants the sat region, about 15% of the total nucleolar chromosomal length, did not pair. he et al.  <cit>  suggested the sat region of nucleolar chromosomes may be the region of sex determination. they also suggested that sex chromosomes were probably at an early stage of differentiation in actinidia.

the dna content of the 2c genome of a. chinensis measured by flow cytometry was reported to be  <dig>  –  <dig>  pg  <cit> , which corresponds to about  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp per genome. the genus contains species that form a polyploid series from diploid to octoploid  <cit> .

as kiwifruit is a relatively new crop, knowledge of its genetic make-up is limited, so the development of a comprehensive genetic map and the use of molecular markers have the potential to improve efficiency in breeding new cultivars. a map will also help to simplify genomic studies to identify and isolate genes. genetic linkage maps based on the recombination values of molecular markers have been constructed in an increasing number of plants  and are proving valuable tools for plant breeding. the construction of a genetic map in an obligate outbreeding species, such as a. chinensis, is more complex than one derived from inbred or homozygous parents. maps in outbreeding species have been developed by utilising the two-way pseudo-testcross procedure  <cit> , where the mapping population is the f <dig> progeny of a cross between unrelated, highly heterozygous individuals. constructing the linkage map is complicated, as the two-way pseudo-test cross may segregate for up to four alleles at any locus, with one or both parents heterozygous at any given locus. the linkage phase of the markers will often be unknown, and can be different for the two parents, which can lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of recombination frequencies  <cit> . the recombination frequencies can, however, be separately estimated for each parent so that two maps are developed, and these maps can be integrated using markers that are heterozygous in both parents. two low density linkage maps have been reported in actinidia. testolin et al.  <cit>  used the progeny of an interspecific cross between a. chinensis and a. callosa to construct, at a lod score ≥  <dig> , a female map of  <dig> loci over  <dig> linkage groups and a male map of  <dig> loci over  <dig> linkage groups.

while marker systems such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms , amplified fragment length polymorphisms , random amplified polymorphic dna , or single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been developed to facilitate genetic mapping and gene discovery, the marker system of choice in many plant species is microsatellites . microsatellites are arrays of short tandem repeat motifs of  <dig> to  <dig> base pairs in length which are characterized by their abundance, their distribution in both non-coding and coding regions of eukaryotic genomes, reproducibility, mendelian mode of inheritance and co-dominant nature  <cit> . they are recognised as highly informative genetic markers because of their inherent variability. this hypervariability is due to the high mutation rate within the nucleotide sequences of the microsatellites, and increases with increasing number of tandem repeats. in humans, heterozygosities generally exceed  <dig>  and range as high as  <dig> , with as many as  <dig> alleles per locus  <cit> , and mutation rates, though variable among loci, exceed rates for non-microsatellite loci by up to four orders of magnitude  <cit> . similar hypervariability within microsatellite loci has been reported for birds, insects and plants, and loci may be polymorphic even in species where low levels of genetic diversity make alternate marker systems less useful  <cit> .

the time-consuming and expensive process of developing enriched genomic libraries and the subsequent sequencing and seeking of the simple sequence repeats is now often replaced with data mining of expressed sequence tag  libraries to give a rapid, efficient and low-cost alternative for identifying microsatellites in plant species. microsatellites have been found to occur regularly in ests  <cit> . the frequency of occurrence of microsatellites of suitable length  varied in five cereals examined from  <dig> % for maize to  <dig> % for rice  <cit> . this percentage would be sufficient to yield numerous markers from plant species in which large numbers of ests have been developed. in actinidia the frequency of occurrence and level of polymorphism of est-derived di-nucleotide microsatellites were sampled and found to be numerous in both the 5' and 3' ends of the genes represented, and highly polymorphic  in the mapping population  <cit> .

the construction of a single map for a cross in an outbreeding species, rather than two separate maps for the parents, depends on the availability of markers that are heterozygous in both parents. these markers form allelic bridges  <cit> . dominant markers such as rapds or aflps are generally of very limited use in combining parental maps, therefore, when the homologous linkage groups of the parents of a mapping population are required to be integrated, co-dominant markers such as microsatellites or rflps are the markers of choice, and allow the construction of either separate parental maps, or an integrated map for the cross  <cit> .

here we present comprehensive genetic linkage maps of female and male informative markers mapped in a cross in the outbreeding species a. chinensis, and also an integrated map of the cross, achieved through the use of co-dominant microsatellite markers. the twenty nine linkage groups are defined, and the position of sex-determining loci identified. genetic linkage maps in actinidia have been developed to supply markers for breeding novel cultivars, to provide tools for comparative and quantitative trait mapping, and to investigate the evolution and function of genetic control mechanisms.

RESULTS
linkage map construction
we have created three gene-rich genetic maps, female, male and consensus, identifying the  <dig> linkage groups of the haploid genome and incipient x and y sex chromosomes . the female linkage map constructed at lod  <dig> and higher, was composed of  <dig> markers clearly defining  <dig> linkage groups and covered  <dig> cm in the kosambi function . the male map, composed of  <dig> markers, was shorter than the female map at  <dig> cm in length . estimated genome lengths of the female and male parents, using method  <dig> of chakravarti, were  <dig> and  <dig> cm respectively. the method based on average marker spacing adjustment  <cit>  gave a genome length of  <dig> cm in the female and  <dig> cm in the male.

the same genome lengths with the adjustment for chromosome ends as per remington et al. were  <dig> and  <dig> cm. a statistical programme that assumes markers are randomly distributed gave an estimate of intra-marker distance. markers were estimated to be within  <dig> cm of each other in over 96% and 94% of the female and male genomes respectively . these estimates could be somewhat biased due to the non-randomness of marker distribution as noted below. the estimates were based on the adjusted genome lengths. the same genome coverage estimates based on the ratio of observed to estimated genome lengths were 80% and 83% respectively.

in the construction of the male map, linkage groups lg <dig> and lg <dig> were formatted in two separate sections. however, when the consensus map was compiled, the relatedness of the sections was confirmed through fully informative markers associating them with the corresponding linkage group in the female map. the consensus map, of length  <dig> cm, and composed of  <dig> markers, showed some regions of altered linear order of markers from the sex-related maps .

the chi-square value for goodness-of-fit for the female map was  <dig>  with  <dig> df. the p-value for a larger chi-square value than observed was  <dig>  which indicated a statistically significant departure from a poisson random process. linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had significantly higher number of markers than expected from a random distribution. similarly, linkage groups  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had significantly fewer. for the male map the chi-square value was  <dig>  with  <dig> df and a p-value of  <dig> . when related to randomness of marker distribution, this value was non-significant.

marker characteristics
a total of  <dig> primer pairs defining potential microsatellite markers were trialled for map construction. polymorphism was established between the parents before a marker was evaluated for segregation across the genotypes of  <dig> siblings in the f <dig> mapping population. a total of  <dig> ssr markers from the  <dig> primer pairs tested, the two sex-linked scar markers and eight indel/snp markers were considered to be of sufficient quality to use for map construction. flower sex phenotype , with aa alleles in females and ab alleles in males, was mapped as a male informative marker. a number of the markers amplified more than one locus in the mapping population and these are identified by a number in brackets . markers that were non-polymorphic in the parents, or non-segregating in the progeny, together made up 39% of the discarded potential markers, 18% of the marker results were difficult to read when one amplifying locus was overlying another and the alleles could not be unequivocally allocated to an individual locus, and 43% showed low information content, non-conforming ratios or poor pcr amplification. in some instances the pcr product was larger than the standard, and unable to be read. this was due to introns amplified from the genomic dna that were not seen in the est sequences. the allelic information content of the markers was of four types . on the consensus map  fully informative markers segregated 1:1:1: <dig> and made up 34% of the markers mapped, female informative and male informative markers segregating 1: <dig> were 37% and 21% respectively, and 8% were only partly informative segregating 1:2: <dig> or 3: <dig>  null alleles featured in all informative groups. of the  <dig> markers in the consensus map,  <dig> markers were est-derived and representative of expressed genes.

the female alleles were identified first and carried the designation ab if both alleles were visible, the male alleles were cd. where homology, or null alleles restricted naming the female alleles, then the male alleles were identified in alphabetical order. when null alleles were present, they were informative in various combinations of alleles as shown, but did reduce the information content of the makers overall.

identification of the x and y chromosomes in the female and male linkage maps
the male-sex-linked marker smy and the phenotype 'flowersex' both mapped to a subtelometic region on lg <dig> in the male genetic map. the fully informative marker udkac <dig>  which mapped in the vicinity of the two markers, was used to identify the corresponding sex linkage group in the female map. while the markers over a large part of the length of these linkage groups were reliably ordered, in a section around the sex markers, some markers were found to alter order after consecutive runs of the map. this unreliably ordered portion of the linkage group contained seven markers including five est-derived ssrs indicative of expressed genes . primer pairs of these five markers amplified products from both x and y chromosomes, suggesting conservation of dna sequence at primer sites on x and y chromosomes.

the genes associated with individual markers were suggested to belong to certain gene families through blast searches.

genes mapped to the sex chromosomes
seventeen markers that mapped to the linkage group containing the sex-determining locus were derived from ssrs associated with ests and therefore could be matched to expressed genes. blast searches of the genbank database were used to try and identify potential functions for these ests . nine ests showed homology to sequences of known function. however, with the exception of ke <dig> and ke <dig>  with homology to transcription factors, the function of these ests appeared unlikely to influence flower sex. the seven remaining genes were all listed in the 'unknown function' category.

discussion
genetic linkage maps
gene-rich genetic maps of the actinidia chinensis female and male genomes, together with a consensus map of the two genomes, have been constructed. est-derived microsatellites proved to be extremely polymorphic and a high proportion were mapped . the loci were widely distributed over the  <dig> linkage groups we have identified. some linkage groups carried fewer markers than others  and this may be a reflection of the number of genes contained on a particular linkage group, or may be due to sampling bias in the ests selected for mapping. we sampled expressed genes that will be found in euchromatic rather than heterochromatic regions of the genome, not all tissues of the plant were represented, for example, there were no root libraries sampled, and we only selected ests that contained a large microsatellite in the transcribed sequence. while our sampling methods will have influenced the non-randomness of the markers on our genetic map, the abundance and relative distribution of microsatellites between transcribed and non-transcribed regions of the genome has been reviewed  <cit> , and has been reported to be non-random. morgante et al.  <cit>  report that microsatellite frequency was higher in transcribed regions, particularly in the untranslated portions, than in genomic dna, and suggest that most microsatellites are found in regions pre-dating the genome expansion in many plants.

many of the est-derived primer pairs amplified more than one locus. the loci from a single primer pair could be on separate linkage groups, at a distance from one another on the same linkage group, or, with the resolving power of joinmap software, unable to be separated on the map. various authors  <cit> , have considered the possibility that diploid a. chinensis is a paleopolyploid, and some evidence they present would support this view. the haploid number of  <dig> is high, and would suggest that polyploidization may have occurred more than once, and may also have involved hybridization. alternatively, duplication of a dna segment may have occurred. this duplication event may have been physically separated by cross-over events or inversions, or tandem repeats may still be in evidence and markers that were unable to be separated could reflect this condition. as one of the primers of a pair was located within the translated portion of the est to facilitate marker transfer to other species, it is reasonable to suggest that the genes were either duplicated, or members of a gene family with strong sequence homology in the transcribed region. however, a random priming event cannot be ruled out entirely.

theoretical putative sex chromosomes
in the genus actinidia all known species are dioecious, so it is reasonable to suggest that dioecy preceded speciation. for the sexes to remain separate over the period of differentiation to speciation, the genes responsible for the male and female characteristics would need to be tightly linked on the two haplotypes of one chromosome, and suppression of recombination would be essential to prevent the recurrence of hermaphroditism. it is not known how many genes are responsible for sex determination. in actinidia we believe there must be at least two genes involved in the development of dioecy. one possible model that has been proposed has a dominant allele for pistil suppression closely linked to a dominant allele for pollen development on the putative y chromosome, while the equivalent differential segment on the x chromosome has two alleles that function as recessives, one allowing pistil development and one leading to programmed pollen death  <cit> .

the genetic structure of the sex-determining region in the genus actinidia has not previously been described. the chromosomes of actinidia are small and of a fairly uniform size, and no definite sex chromosomes have been identified, though he et al.  <cit>  described physical characteristics of a theoretical y chromosome based on cytological studies. the genetic structure of lg  <dig> would also suggest that, in the male genotype, in a subtelomeric region of the chromosome, recombination was suppressed and marker order was difficult to establish. lack of recombination is typical of a sex-determining region, so our data support the observation of he et al.  <cit> .

there is evidence that sex chromosomes originate from autosomes  <cit> , and it is thought that translocation of genetic material to sex chromosomes has occurred  <cit> . a mutation that produced female or male sterility could, in theory, be found in any part of the chromosome. however, for full dioecy to develop, more than one mutation would need to have occurred, and the sexual differences would need to be fixed in the genome for gender-specific chromosomes to result. suppression of recombination in the region of the mutations, allowing multiple loci to remain linked, would be required. such regions of suppressed recombination are known, especially in the heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes such as the pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of autosomes  <cit> . pericentromeric locations have been identified as incipient sex-determining loci in asparagus, asparagus officinalis l.  <cit> , and papaya, carica papaya  <cit> , both species showing severe suppression of recombination around the sex-determining locus. again, the recently reported incipient sex chromosomes in the genus populus showed recombination suppression in the vicinity of the gender-linked locus. in populus, like actinidia chinensis, the sex-determining region was identified in the subtelomeric portion of a single chromosome pair  <cit> . in the sex-determining locus of actinidia several genes were associated with the sex-linked smx and smy markers and the phenotype 'flowersex'. the suppression of recombination around the sex-determining locus prevents recombination mapping from determining the accurate linear ordering of these genes, and the estimation of their distances from each other.

the genes of unknown function in the sex-determining locus may be similar to unidentified genes in other genera, or they may be specific to floral development in actinidia. the markers have been used to identify bacterial artificial chromosomes  specific to the region and this is the first step in isolating and characterizing genes of the sex chromosomes in this genus. in addition, the gene-rich linkage map we have constructed will be a valuable resource for quantitative trait loci  analyses to identify markers related to traits of importance in breeding new and novel kiwifruits for the markets of the world. it will also considerably advance the development of a physical map for map-based cloning of genes for characterization.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the genetic structure of all  <dig> linkage groups corresponding to n =  <dig> in a diploid species of the genus actinidia. map construction has been robust at lods between  <dig> and  <dig>  as the majority of the markers represent expressed genes, we anticipate that this resource will be useful in understanding genetic diversity in the genus. we have also identified, through sex-linked markers, putative x and y chromosomes. these would appear to be in the early stages of evolution, as the subtelomeric sex-determining locus occupies only a small portion of the chromosome, as assessed through evidence of non-recombination, while the remainder of the chromosomes have the character of autosomes.
