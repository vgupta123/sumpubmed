BACKGROUND
the importance of the somatic compartment in oocyte developmental competence  acquisition has been stressed in many vertebrate species. in mammals, bidirectional communications between oocyte and surrounding somatic cells are required for meiotic maturation and acquisition of oocyte competence
 <cit> . follicular cells control oocyte development and maturation via specific molecular signals including different lh-receptor activated signaling pathways
 <cit> . in prophase i-arrested oocytes, meiosis inhibitory signals from somatic cells pass through gap junctions between the oocyte and surrounding somatic cells
 <cit> . meiotic maturation is associated with inactivation of these gap junctions, and this process is evolutionary conserved between mammals and c. elegans <cit> . in teleost fish, when meiosis resumption can be triggered directly by the maturing steroid hormone acting at the oocyte level, the resulting metaphase ii oocytes sometimes exhibit poor developmental competence. in contrast, when meiosis resumption is induced by gonadotropin hormones acting upstream , a much higher developmental competence is often observed
 <cit> . several bodies of evidence further indicate in several fish species that, in addition to the well documented roles in meiotic maturation, somatic compartments of the ovarian follicle play an important role to allow full oocyte developmental competence acquisition
 <cit> . a number of studies have subsequently demonstrated that many genes were actively expressed in somatic follicular layers during final oocyte maturation including genes coding for steroidogenic enzymes, paracrine factors, gonadotropin receptors, and cell-to-cell communication-related genes such as connexins . less is known about the contribution of follicular somatic cells to oocyte developmental competence in amphibians as the focus has mostly been made on intra-oocyte mechanisms underlying growth and meiotic maturation. the role of granulosa cells in the steroidogenic control of oogenesis is nevertheless well established and, similarly to fish, communications between oocyte and adjacent somatic cells are established through gap junctional complexes in a gonadotropin-dependent manner. this gap junction coupling has been shown to facilitate vitellogenin uptake by the oocyte
 <cit> . likewise, maternal xenopus activin which is involved in mesoderm induction during early embryogenesis is initially produced by ovarian follicular cells and transferred along with vitellogenin to the growing oocytes
 <cit> . interestingly, the oocyte was shown to influence steroidogenesis in surrounding granulosa cells, thus indicating a dialog between follicular and somatic compartments of the ovarian follicle
 <cit> .

despite the known importance of somatic cells for oocyte developmental competence acquisition, the overall mechanisms underlying full developmental competence acquisition are far from being understood. this is especially true in non-mammalian species. in addition, most existing studies have been devoted to a single species. to date, no comprehensive view of the contribution of molecular actors from somatic origin to oocyte developmental competence acquisition is available. the present works thus aimed at identifying key molecular signals, from somatic origin, that would be shared by evolutionary distant vertebrate species in order to offer an evolutionary perspective on oocyte developmental competence acquisition in vertebrates.

using a parallel transcriptomic analysis of the somatic cells surrounding the oocyte in  <dig> vertebrate species - a teleost fish, an amphibian, and two mammals - at key steps of developmental competence acquisition, we identified a surprisingly high number of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles among the  <dig> tetrapods and among the  <dig> vertebrates including a significant subset of novel molecular actors from somatic origin, some of them being also shared by drosophila.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes in the  <dig> studied species
a microarray analysis was performed using somatic follicular cells surrounding the oocyte in  <dig> vertebrate species  at  <dig> similar key stages of oocyte developmental competence acquisition: developmentally incompetent or poorly competent prophase i oocytes , developmentally competent prophase i oocytes , and developmentally competent metaphase ii oocytes . corresponding data were deposited in gene expression omnibus  database in a superseries under the reference gse <dig> 

in rainbow trout,  <dig> probes were found to be differentially expressed between at least  <dig> of the studied stages . theses probes were blasted on existing rainbow trout public contigs. a blastx analysis  was subsequently performed using identified rainbow trout contig sequences in order to identify corresponding zebrafish  sequences. the corresponding unique  <dig> full-length zebrafish protein sequences were subsequently used for further orthomcl analysis to identify groups of orthologous genes among the differentially expressed genes of each species .

in xenopus laevis,  <dig> probes were found to be differentially expressed between at least  <dig> of the studied stages . among those  <dig> probes,  <dig> unique xenopus laevis refseq sequences could be identified and kept for further orthomcl analysis .

in cow,  <dig> probes were found to be differentially expressed between at least  <dig> of the studied stages . among those  <dig> probes,  <dig> unique bos taurus refseq sequences could be identified and kept for further orthomcl analysis .

in the mouse,  <dig> probes were found to be differentially expressed between at least  <dig> of the studied stages . among those  <dig> probes,  <dig> unique mus musculus refseq sequences could be identified and kept for further orthomcl analysis .

orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in at least  <dig> species
orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the  <dig> studied non-mammalian species
a total of  <dig> orthomcl groups  were found in which at least  <dig> rainbow trout gene and  <dig> xenopus gene exhibited a similar – up or down - differential expression between at least  <dig> among the  <dig> studied oocyte developmental stages . in rainbow trout,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> xenopus gene had a similar expression profile . in xenopus,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> rainbow trout gene had a similar expression profile . in both species, two main expression clusters could be identified that corresponded to up- and down-regulated genes at c <dig> stage, respectively. in rainbow trout, in which all growing follicles develop simultaneously and progressively during reproductive season, the expression profiles observed were more progressive than in xenopus and were correlated to the progressive follicular differentiation stage within each studied group. in contrast, expression profiles in xenopus exhibited a strict stage-dependent profile. in addition to the  <dig> main expression clusters characterized by a marked up-  or down-regulation  in c <dig> follicles, a smaller cluster characterized by an up-regulation in c <dig> follicles and a subsequent down-regulation in c <dig> follicles was found in both species . as an example of the conserved expression profiles between trout and xenopus, anti-proliferative b-cell translocation gene  <dig>  exhibited a sharp  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold over expression at c <dig> stage in trout and xenopus, respectively . similarly, noelin- <dig> exhibited a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold overexpression at c <dig> stage in trout and xenopus, respectively. the expression profile of sestrin <dig> was also characterized by a strong up-regulation at c <dig> stage, even though the up-regulation appeared more progressive throughout oocyte competence acquisition, especially in xenopus. for some other genes, the differential expression observed at c <dig> stage was more pronounced in one of the two species as illustrated for adam8/ <dig> and sec <dig>  among the genes exhibiting a stepwise down-regulation in the somatic cells surrounding the oocyte throughout the process of oocyte competence acquisition, a strong down-regulation was observed for the genes belonging to the tcf21/tcf <dig> group of orthologous genes . 

among all the genes exhibiting a differential expression in both non-mammalian species, a significant enrichment was observed in genes involved in proteasome and extra-cellular matrix –receptor interaction pathways .

orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the  <dig> studied mammalian species
a total of  <dig> orthomcl groups were found in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> species exhibited a differential expression between at least  <dig> among the  <dig> studied oocyte developmental stages . in the mouse,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> bovine gene had a similar profile . in cow,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> mouse gene had a similar profile . in the  <dig> species, the supervised clustering analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> main gene clusters corresponding to a differential – up or down - expression in somatic cells surrounding c <dig> oocytes. among all common differential genes in mammals, the most significant enrichment was observed in genes involved in energy metabolism such as fatty acid, pyruvate, and propanoate metabolism as well as insulin or adipocytokine signaling . were also enriched a number of genes involved in the regulation of focal adhesion, gap-junctions, actin cytoskeleton, and oocyte meiosis . moreover, numerous genes taking a part in ppar, vegf, map kinases and tgfbeta signaling were also enriched in both species .

orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the  <dig> studied tetrapod species
a total of  <dig> orthomcl groups were found in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> species exhibited a differential expression between at least  <dig> among the  <dig> studied oocyte developmental stages . in xenopus,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> other tetrapod species had a similar expression profile . in the mouse,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> other tetrapod species had a similar profile . in cow,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> other tetrapod species had a similar profile . in the  <dig> species, the supervised clustering analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> main gene clusters corresponding to a differential – up or down - expression in somatic cells surrounding c <dig> oocytes. in both clusters, a significant enrichment in genes associated with specific biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways could be identified. among the common genes differentially expressed in the  <dig> tetrapod species, the most significant enrichment was observed for genes involved in energy metabolism . we also observed a significant enrichment in genes involved in vegf signaling, tgf-beta signaling, adipocytokine signaling, mapk signaling, oocyte meiosis, focal adhesion, gap junctions and cytoskeleton regulation .

among the genes that were markedly differentially expressed in the  <dig> tetrapod species, an orthomcl group corresponding to the tribbles gene family was identified. hence, a dramatic over expression of trib <dig> at c <dig> stage was observed in mouse and cow while the overexpression was more limited, even though significant, in xenopus . similarly a conserved overexpression was observed at c <dig> stage in the  <dig> species for the orthomcl groups corresponding to tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member  <dig> , sphingomyelin synthase  <dig> , syntaxin 1a , and protein kinase c and casein kinase substrate in neurons  <dig>  . in addition, genes exhibiting a marked down-regulation at the c <dig> stage could also be observed. in mice and cow, a dramatic down-regulation of cornichon homolog  <dig>  was observed while a milder decrease was observed in xenopus .

orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the  <dig> studied species
a total of  <dig> orthomcl groups were found in which at least  <dig> gene of the  <dig> species exhibited a conserved differential expression between at least  <dig> of the  <dig> studied oocyte developmental stages . in rainbow trout,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene had a similar profile in the  <dig> other species . in xenopus,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene had a similar profile in the  <dig> other species. in the mouse,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene had a similar profile in the  <dig> other species. in cow,  <dig> genes belonged to an orthomcl group in which at least  <dig> gene had a similar profile in the  <dig> other species. in the  <dig> species, the supervised clustering analysis resulted in the identification of  <dig> main gene clusters corresponding to a differential – up or down - expression in somatic cells surrounding c <dig> oocytes . four significantly enriched pathways were identified among the differentially expressed othologous genes common to the  <dig> species . as shown, they include genes involved in the regulation of focal adhesion , ecm-receptor interaction  and metabolism .

among the  <dig> orthomcl groups in which similar expression profiles were found in the  <dig> species, the following groups showed the most remarkable profiles. an orthomcl group corresponding to the kelch family was identified in which several genes were differentially expressed . in the mouse, the genes klhl <dig>  klhl <dig>  and klhl <dig> exhibited very similar expression patterns with a sharp increase at c <dig>  in cow, a very similar expression pattern was observed for klhl <dig> while klhl <dig> exhibited a more progressive over-expression in xenopus. in rainbow trout, even though the exact identity of the klhl-related gene remained unclear, the pattern was highly similar to that of mouse and cow. an orthomcl group corresponding to kruppel-like factor  <dig>  was identified in which a similar differential expression profile was observed for the  <dig> species . in all species the expression at c <dig> stage was higher than at nc <dig> stage. a burst in klf expression was however observed in xenopus at c <dig> stage, suggesting that overexpression occurred earlier in this species. similarly, a clear increase in the expression of adamts <dig> gene was observed in the  <dig> species .

 <dig>  were monitored using qpcr . the profiles obtained using qpcr confirmed the differential expression observed using microarrays.

discussion
in the present study we were able to identify orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in the somatic cells surrounding the oocyte during developmental competence acquisition in vertebrates. our results rely on genome-wide transcriptome analyses carried out, in parallel, in four different vertebrate species using  a similar technology and  similar key steps of developmental competence acquisition. the transcriptome analysis was followed by an orthomcl analysis to specifically identify orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles. to our knowledge such an approach has never been used to investigate the oogenetic process in evolutionary distant vertebrate species.

a surprisingly high number of orthologous genes exhibiting evolutionary-conserved expression profiles
we identified a surprisingly high number of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles at key steps of oocyte-developmental competence in different vertebrate species. this is especially true in mice and cow in which ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> orthologous genes were identified, respectively. this is also the case in tetrapod species in which ~ <dig> orthologous genes were found to be differentially expressed in the  <dig> species among a total of 4000– <dig> differentially expressed genes in each species. it has to be stressed that the highest number of differentially expressed genes  was found in the mouse in which the number of spotted probes was twice as high as in the  <dig> other species. together, this suggests that approximately 10% of the differentially expressed genes have orthologs in the  <dig> other tetrapod species that behave similarly during oocyte developmental competence acquisition. it should be noted that the percentage of orthologous genes with similar profiles is remarkably high when considering the major differences in follicle ultrastructure and physiological regulations that exist between amphibians and mammals. this suggests a strong conservation -and possibly a crucial role - of the corresponding molecular mechanisms during vertebrate evolution despite the presence of an antrum in the mammalian ovarian follicle and the absence of antrum in non-mammalian vertebrates. in agreement with this hypothesis is the significant enrichment in genes involved in cellular energy metabolism, cell-to-cell communications, and meiosis observed in the three tetrapod species and the two mammalian species. among the four vertebrate species studied herein, a much more limited set of common differentially expressed genes could be identified, in comparison to the large number of common genes shared by the three tetrapod species or by the two mammalian species. this can largely be explained by the evolutionary distance between the species, especially between rainbow trout and mammals. several methodological reasons also exist that have possibly reduced the number of common genes identified. these reasons are mostly due to the lack of genome sequence availability in rainbow trout and its consequences on the design of the oligonucleotides and on subsequent in silico analysis. despite these difficulties, we were able to highlight genes and pathways involved in oocyte developmental competence acquisition in the four vertebrate species . in consistency with data obtained in tetrapods and mammals, our results stress the importance of the nutritive role of the somatic cells surrounding the oocyte and of the mechanisms involved in extracellular matrix formation. in addition, more than  <dig> common genes were identified in rainbow trout and xenopus as highlighted in the result section .

in the present study, we have deliberately chosen to highlight some of the genes exhibiting similar profiles in the somatic compartment during oocyte developmental competence acquisition in several vertebrate species. many groups of orthologous genes  were however identified that could not be discussed here due to space limitations. all corresponding expression profiles and orthomcl information are however available  and can be searched for specific genes or mechanisms. we believe that this unique dataset will be very useful to investigators in the fields of reproductive biology and evolutionary biology. similarly, the large species-specific datasets generated in the present study can be further analyzed by other investigators to address species-specific questions.

mammals
as indicated above, our approach has led to the identification of more than  <dig> orthologous genes that deserve further analysis. in the present study, we have deliberately chosen to focus our analysis on common genes shared by tetrapods or vertebrates in agreement with the main objectives of our study. we will however briefly highlight in this section some of the identified genes differentially expressed in both mouse and cow in order to stress the biological relevance of our approach and to clearly demonstrate the methodological validity of our results.

extra-cellular matrix remodeling linked to ovulation
cathepsin s  and cathepsin b  are lysosomal cysteine proteinases involved in degradation of extracellular matrix. their transcripts  were over-expressed in cumulus complexes  of mature  oocytes in mice and cow in comparison to ccs surrounding developmentally incompetent oocytes . in fact, ctss and ctsb genes were reported as markers of oocyte developmental competence in cow and their expression in ccs of metaphase-ii oocytes was shown to be high in comparison to immature oocytes
 <cit> . both cathepsins were also detected and localized in mice ovary
 <cit> . secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein  is a matricellular protein expressed during tissue morphogenesis and reorganization, and we observed an increase of transcript level  between nc <dig> and c <dig> stages in both mice and cow. in agreement with our observations, high expression levels of sparc were previously reported in mice cumulus oophorus
 <cit> . in bovine ccs, the upregulation of sparc was related to cumulus expansion in response to growth factors complementation during ivm
 <cit> .

ligands and receptors of the developing follicle
follistatin  is involved in inhibition of fsh release, and was also found to be expressed in mice and bovine ocs
 <cit> . our transcriptomic analysis revealed the high expression of fst gene  in immature ccs in both species and a significant decrease after maturation. similarly, the transcript levels of anti-mullerian hormone  and one of its receptors amh type ii receptor  dramatically decreased in ccs upon cow and mouse oocyte maturation . such an expression profile of the hormone has already been recently described in cow ovary
 <cit>  as well as in many other mammalian species . to our knowledge, amhr <dig> expression pattern has not been studied in cow ovaries but in rat as well as in mouse, this receptor was shown to be mainly expressed in granulosa cells of preantral and early antral follicles
 <cit> . similar observations can be made for the fsh receptor  for which a down-regulation was observed herein at c <dig> stage in both species as previously observed at least in cow ovaries
 <cit> .

intra-cellular cell signaling
phosphodiesterases  regulate intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentration by converting cyclic nucleotides into 5' nucleotides. their activity was found in mice and bovine granulosa/cumulus cells
 <cit>  and inhibition of pde3/pde <dig> activity blocks meiosis in bovine oocytes
 <cit> . in our study, several genes encoding pdes were found to be similarly expressed in mice and bovine. thus, mrna level of pdea <dig> and pde6d  increased during maturation, and that of pde5a and pde7a  decreased. similarly, erβ transcript  is down regulated between c <dig> and c <dig> stage in bovine and mouse cumulus in the present study in agreement with previous reports demonstrating a predominant expression of this er isoform in small rodent preovulatory follicles
 <cit>  and a down-regulation by gonadotropins
 <cit> . such a regulated pattern of expression was also reported in bovine follicles
 <cit> .

tetrapods
among the genes exhibiting a conserved profile during oocyte developmental competence acquisition, some were previously known to play an important role as illustrated hereafter. this further validates the approach used in the present study. for instance, growth hormone receptor  has been shown to be expressed in ovarian follicles in many vertebrate species and involved in folliculogenesis, particularly by promoting secondary follicle growth and antrum formation in mammals as shown in cases of ghr deficiency in cow
 <cit>  and in mice
 <cit>  . in the present study, the corresponding transcript  was highly expressed in nc <dig> and or c <dig> stage granulosa cells and was down-regulated in c <dig> stage in the  <dig> tetrapod species. these observations are in full agreement with previous reports in cow, mice and even fish. indeed, a study conducted at the protein level in rainbow trout showed that ovarian growth hormone receptor concentration was high during the early phases of follicular development and subsequently decreased during oocyte and follicular growth to reach a minimal value during oocyte maturation
 <cit> .

in addition to genes known to participate in ovarian functions, our study also shed light on a large number of molecular actors for which a role in ovarian physiology was previously unsuspected or poorly investigated. this is for instance the case of a decoy tnf receptor gene up-regulated at c <dig> stage . the importance of the tnf system in folliculogenesis is well known and many tnf ligands and “classical” receptors are differentially regulated during oogenesis in a wide variety of vertebrate species
 <cit> . although the precise role of tnfrsf <dig> in the mammalian ovary remains uncharacterized, it is thought to be a decoy tnf receptor
 <cit> . decoy tnf receptors have the ability to bind tnf ligands without inducing cell death. interestingly, alternatively spliced variants of tnfrsf <dig> are expressed in the chicken ovary
 <cit>  and a decoy tnf receptor was found to be differentially expressed in the fish ovary during final oocyte maturation
 <cit> . an increased expression of a set of genes, including sphingomyelin synthase  <dig> , syntaxin 1a , and pacsin <dig>  which are implicated to a different extent in exo/endocytosis and protein trafficking, was also observed in our study, particularly at c <dig> stage . to the best of our knowledge, none of these genes has ever been reported to play a role in ovarian follicle/oocyte development. sgms <dig>  by regulating cellular levels of ceramide and diacylglycerol, can affect the proliferation/apoptosis balance and it has only been shown to participate in tnf-mediated apoptosis in chinese hamster ovary cells
 <cit> . stx1a is rather expressed in neurons while the expression of other syntaxins, such as stx4a or stx7/avalanche, has been reported in human granulosa cells or in drosophila follicle cells, respectively
 <cit> . finally, pacsin <dig> besides its role in vesicular transport, membrane dynamics, and cytoskeleton organization also participates in addressing some ion channels and glucose transporters to the plasma membrane
 <cit> . in the present study, down-regulation of a cornichon-related gene  expression was evidenced in the somatic compartment during oocyte competence acquisition in the  <dig> tetrapod species . cornichon  proteins have been studied in drosophila and yeast, cni being involved in drosophila embryo polarization
 <cit> . four genes exist in vertebrates . recent evidence suggested that metazoans cornichon proteins have a similar subcellular localization and regulate transport of tgfα family ligands
 <cit> . the transcripts of cnih are highly abundant in full grown oocyte and unfertilized egg in mice. a role in ovarian follicular regulation has, however, never been reported in any vertebrate species to date. interestingly, cni plays an important role in drosophila oogenesis and more specifically in a signal transduction pathway that transmits information between the germline cells and the somatic follicle cells of the ovary
 <cit> . together, these observations suggest an important, yet unsuspected, role of the cnih family in the somatic compartment of the follicle during oocyte competence acquisition in tetrapods.

finally, up-regulation of tribbles homolog  <dig>  was evidenced herein during oocyte maturation  in surrounding somatic cells . trib <dig> belongs to a family of genes  that has been implicated in the development of many diseases including cancers ; for instance, trib <dig> is involved in the onset of acute myeloid leukemia  by regulating c/ebp transcription factor levels and activity through a mapk -dependent pathway
 <cit> , but is also associated with hyperlipidemia
 <cit> . interestingly, yamamoto et al.
 <cit>  have observed that trib1-deficient drosophila and mouse females are infertile; in drosophila, such a phenotype is likely due to the fact that trib <dig> has been shown to regulate migration of a cluster of ovarian follicle  cells, called border cells, leading to micropyle formation required for oocyte fertilization. in this case, trib <dig> function would also involve a post-translational regulation of the drosophila c/ebp homologue, slbo
 <cit> . in mammals, the mechanisms underlying trib <dig> participation in ovarian folliculogenesis and oocyte development remain however to be elucidated.

together, our results demonstrate that tetrapods share a large number of common molecular actors from somatic origin that have similar expression profiles during developmental competence acquisition. this suggests that many conserved mechanisms exist in the ovary that are required or important for the acquisition of a full developmental competence. we also showed that many of the new players presently identified in the context of oocyte competence acquisition in our study were previously unstudied in the ovary and deserve further investigations. finally, our results reveal that some of the important molecular actors from somatic origin found in tetrapods are also shared by some non-vertebrate metazoan species. this suggests that some of the key signals from somatic origin involved in oocyte developmental competence acquisition would be shared, not only by vertebrates, but also by metazoans.

vertebrates
among the four vertebrate species studied, a total of  <dig> groups of orthologous genes could be identified that shared similar expression profiles. as for tetrapods, our study shed light on novel molecular players from somatic origin. this is for instance the case of the kelch family for which different members are differentially expressed, depending on the species. the kelch protein was initially discovered in drosophila in which it is known to play an important role during oogenesis and more specifically in the communications between somatic cells and oocyte. such communications are required for the development of a normal oocyte and mutation of kelch leads to female infertility
 <cit> . the kelch protein family is a large multigenic family and over  <dig> kelch-like proteins  exist in humans. a comprehensive picture of the entire family is however currently lacking in vertebrates and little is known about the role of kelch proteins during oogenesis. our results, evidencing a conserved regulation of kelch gene expression in the somatic compartment are thus extremely original and suggest an evolutionary-conserved important role of kelch proteins in the development of a normal oocyte in insects and vertebrates. our results are also consistent with the abundant expression of klhl <dig> previously reported in human ovary
 <cit> .

similarly, the krüppel-like factor  is also a large multigenic family named after the drosophila krüppel protein and  <dig> klf genes can be found in the human genome
 <cit> . the klfs are transcription factors that regulate a wide variety of biological processes including proliferation, growth, development, survival, and responses to external stress . their role in reproductive functions has, in contrast, received very little attention. in the present study, we report the up-regulation of klf <dig> mrna expression during oogenesis in the four species. this pattern is consistent with the previous report of klf <dig> mrna expression in swine granulosa cells
 <cit> . in addition, several klf genes were reported to be differentially expressed in the ovarian follicle under normal or pathological conditions
 <cit> . together, this suggests an important role of the klf family in vertebrate oogenesis and a conserved pattern of klf <dig> expression in the somatic compartment during intrafollicular competence acquisition.

finally, we have chosen to highlight the up-regulation of genes belonging to the adamts <dig>  orthomcl group at c <dig> stage in the four vertebrate species studies. in mammals, adamts <dig> plays an important role during ovulation in mammals to prepare the oocyte for fertilization
 <cit> . such role in the inflammatory-like ovulatory process is in agreement with the profiles reported here in mice and cow. in non-mammalian vertebrates, the mechanisms underlying ovulation are less documented. the inflammatory nature of the ovulatory process has, however, been established in fish
 <cit> . the present work strongly suggests that the important role played by adamts <dig> in mammals to prepare the oocyte for fertilization would also be found by non-mammalian vertebrates.

together, the observations made in the  <dig> vertebrate species studied further support the results obtained in the  <dig> tetrapod species that suggest that some of the key signals from somatic origin involved in oocyte developmental competence acquisition would be shared, not only by vertebrates, but also by metazoans.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we have developed a vertebrate-wide transcriptomic analysis of the contribution of the somatic compartment at key stages of oocyte developmental competence acquisition. our approach has led to the identification of a large number of species-specific differentially expressed genes and a surprisingly high number of orthologous genes exhibiting similar expression profiles in evolutionary distant species among tetrapods and among vertebrates. our study demonstrates the usefulness and power of a parallel transcriptomic analysis performed in evolutionary distant vertebrate species to identify evolutionary-conserved mechanisms.

among the evolutionary conserved participants in developmental competence acquisition are genes involved in key processes such as cellular energy metabolism, cell-to-cell communication, and meiosis control. in addition, our results shed light on novel molecular signals from somatic origin during vertebrate oogenesis, some of them being also shared by non-vertebrate species. together, our results suggest an important role of some conserved molecular mechanisms from somatic origin in oocyte developmental competence during the oogenetic process in vertebrates. our results also strongly suggest that some of the key players from somatic origin involved in oocyte developmental competence acquisition would be shared, not only by vertebrates, but also by metazoans. the conservation of these mechanisms during vertebrate evolution further emphasizes the important contribution of the somatic compartment to oocyte developmental competence acquisition during oogenesis and paves the way for future investigations aiming at better understanding what makes a good egg.
