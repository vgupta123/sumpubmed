BACKGROUND
mitochondria contain their own circular bacteria-like genome  that is physically separated from that of the cell nucleus. metazoan mtdna typically consists of a covalently closed circular molecule, tightly packed with a canonical set of  <dig> genes that encode for  <dig> inner membrane proteins,  <dig> ribosomal rnas and  <dig> transfer rnas. these genes have no introns and, generally, few intergenic spacers, the only exception being a large non-coding region  where essential regulatory sequences involved in the initiation of replication and transcription have been identified  <cit> . the arrangement of genes along the mtdna  is generally conserved within major taxonomic groups, but can differ extensively in specific lineages  <cit> .

in the last few years, the genomic resources of public databases have accumulated a remarkable number of complete mitochondrial sequences for hexapods; these form the largest data set of mitogenomic data available for arthropods . within metazoa, the set of complete mtdnas known from hexapod species is outnumbered only by a few vertebrate groups. although numerically biased towards the pterygote orders, hexapod mtdna data have been enriched recently with entries from the more basal lineages , a possible consequence of the growing interest in phylogenetic studies of insects and relatives for the analysis of genome-level data sets  <cit> . at present,  <dig> complete  mtdna sequences have been determined for collembolan  species, although detailed descriptions and analysis have been provided only for a minority. the "basic" arrangement of the  <dig> mitochondrial genes found in collembolan species generally resembles that usually considered ancestral for pancrustacea  <cit> . however, rearrangements of trna genes and/or molecular traces of duplication events appear to be more common than expected.

focusing on antarctic organisms, a remarkable feature, the loss of nad <dig>  has been reported for notothenioid fishes; this unusual rearrangement has been tentatively associated with heat production due to proton leakage, as a possible physiological adaptation to cold environments  <cit> .

collembola have been described as model organisms in antarctic terrestrial ecosystem studies, on account of the extent of existing biochemical and ecophysiological research, and their dominant role in antarctic terrestrial ecosystems  <cit> . in this study we describe the complete mitochondrial genome of the antarctic collembolan cryptopygus antarcticus, the first example from the family isotomidae and only the second  for an antarctic species. recently, molecular phylogeographic studies based on mitochondrial haplotypes have contributed to the understanding of the evolutionary origins of species of the genus cryptopygus  <cit> . mitogenomics data for c. antarcticus will further contribute to studies of the patterns of distribution and the processes of colonization of the antarctic collembolan fauna, a subject of particular recent interest in the context of antarctic phylogeography, carrying signals over multimillion year timescales  <cit> .

RESULTS
gene content and genome organization
the mitochondrial genome of c. antarcticus is a closed circular molecule of  <dig>  bp and contains the set of  <dig> genes usually found in metazoans  <cit>  . the gene order is identical to drosophila yakuba  <cit> , and reflects the presumed ancestral condition for pancrustacea. the majority of genes are located on the plus or j-strand, the remainder having opposite polarity and being oriented on the minus or n-strand . there are four major non-coding regions of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp in length that are located at the gene junctions rrns/trni, trns/cob, nad6/cob and trne/trnf, respectively. the largest non-coding region most likely corresponds to the region  where in other hexapods the sequences responsible for the initiation of transcription and replication of the entire genome are found  <cit> .

gene initiation and termination
canonical initiation codons , encoding the amino acid methionine, are used in  <dig> pcgs , whereas four other genes start with non-standard codons   as it often happens in animal mtdnas  <cit> . only five pcgs terminate with the complete termination codon taa . in all other cases, stop codons are truncated  and their functionality probably recovered after a post-transcriptional polyadenilation  <cit> . these abbreviated stop codons are found in pcgs that are followed by a downstream trna gene, suggesting that the secondary structure information of the trna genes could be responsible for the correct cleavage of the polycistronic transcript. it is noteworthy that in all cases an additional complete stop codon is present a few bases downstream of the incomplete stop codon, as if a short overlap would be necessary to stop the rna polymerase in case translation should begin before mrna cleavage  <cit> . trna genes are usually interspersed among protein coding genes, their secondary structure acting as a signal for the cleavage of the polycistronic primary transcript  <cit> . however, there are also direct junctions between two pcgs  where other cleavage signals, different from trna gene secondary structures, may be involved in the processing of the polycistronic primary transcript  <cit> . in this respect, hairpin structures, frequently observed at the 3'-end of a pcg abutting the 5'-end of a neighbouring one, may serve as signal to direct immature mrna cleavage  <cit> . experimental analyses of cdna pools have demonstrated that some mtdna genes  are recovered as bicistronic units in human hela cells  <cit>  and in the dipteran anopheles funestus  <cit> . in the c. antarcticus mtdna, with the single exception of cox <dig>  a complete stop codon  is only present when two pcgs abutt directly . the gene pair nad4l/nad <dig> is composed of a single in-frame coding unit , whereas atp <dig> and atp <dig> overlap  as is almost universally found in metazoans  <cit> .

transfer rnas
all the  <dig> trna genes typically found in metazoan mtdnas were identified according to their secondary structure and primary sequence of the corresponding anticodon . the only peculiar feature is represented by an additional  copy of the trna gene for the amino acid leucine p), that is located within a non-coding spacer  between trns and nad <dig> . this trna pseudogene may represent the degenerating vestige of a duplication event that occurred in collembolan mtdna early in the evolution of the group, given that in the same position a similar spacer is also present in g. hodgsoni  <cit>   and podura aquatica  <cit>  . other unusual features are the lack of the dhu arm in trns and the reduction of the tÎ¨c arm in trng and trnv . moreover, some trna genes have few mismatches in the acceptor and/or the discriminator arms , trnluag, trnk, trns and trnw). in similar cases  base pairing is restored post- or co-transcriptionally with an rna-editing mechanism  <cit> . overlaps between trna genes were not frequent  and then limited to  <dig> or  <dig> bases .

ribosomal rnas
the putative secondary structures of the complete small and large ribosomal subunits  have been reconstructed for a limited number of insect species, and detailed studies are essentially available only for drosophila virilis, d. melanogaster  <cit>  and apis mellifera  <cit> . within basal hexapod groups, the architectures of the ribosomal subunits have been tentatively reconstructed only for the two species campodea fragilis and c. lubbocki  <cit> , and a more detailed analysis has been performed only for domain iii of the small rna subunit of several arthropleona species  <cit> . additional comparative analyses in basal hexapod lineages are required to allow an accurate comparison with current secondary structure models of holometabolan insects  <cit> , and we therefore made no attempt to reconstruct the structure of the rrns and rrnl rrna here.

a+t-rich region
previous analyses of the drosophila a+t-rich region identified the signals responsible for the origin of replication of the major and minor strands  and confirmed that, at least in this genus, the mtdna replicates with a strand-asynchronous, asymmetric mechanism  <cit> . mapping of oj and on in drosophila and other insect a+t-rich regions has recently allowed the definition of primary sequences and secondary structure elements involved in the initiation of the replication process  <cit> . in holometabolan insects, two distinct thymine stretches, one located near trni on the n-strand and another in the center of the a+t-rich region on the j-strand, appear to be responsible for oj and on replication, respectively. similarly, a thymine stretch plays an essential role in the initiation of the replication system of the light strand  in mammals , and is also believed to be involved in protein binding and primer rna synthesis. nevertheless, the conservation of thymine stretches among insects appears to be a peculiarity of more derived orders, with alternative sequences probably responsible for or in basal hexapod lineages  <cit> .

the a+t-rich region of c. antarcticus is  <dig> bp; it shows six "ta" tandem repeats of variable length  and a low similarity in primary sequence with other collembolan specimens. the identification of sequences homologous to those observed in holometabolan insects involved in or was not completely successful in defining potential regulatory elements. in this respect, four thymine stretches of variable size  could be observed on the n-strand, within  <dig> bp of trni, but none of them appears to correspond, in terms of size and position, to that observed in drosophila. in addition, in agreement with previous reports  <cit>  there is no thymine stretch longer than  <dig> bp on this strand. conversely, in the c. antarcticus j-strand, a longer thymine stretch  is present between nucleotides  <dig> and  <dig> and this appears to be assimilable  to the one observed in the central portion of the drosophila a+t-rich region. similarly to drosophila, this portion of the c. antarcticus a+t-rich region may also act as the on, given that the motif "actattt", frequently present in drosophila , is found  <dig> bp downstream of the 14-bp thymine stretch. if this evidence is confirmed by additional data on basal hexapod mtdna sequences, the role of conserved primary sequence stretches in the initiation of the replication mechanism might be confirmed as a common feature of all hexapod groups , from the most basal to the most derived lineages. the presence of hypothetical secondary structures involved in the initiation of the origin of replication process of the c. antarcticus mtdna is difficult to establish. in this species the entire a+t-rich region can be folded in several paired structures, and additional comparative studies will be needed to clarify their role.

non-coding regions
unlike those of plants, animal mitochondrial genomes are very compact, with a high proportion of coding vs non-coding sequences  <cit> . intergenic spacers are usually limited in number and size, and their occurrence is believed to be the result of errors of the mtdna replication system . apart from the a+t-rich region, the largest  non-coding sequence of the c. antarcticus mtdna is located between trns and nad <dig>  within this region, an additional copy of trnl  can be identified. given that a functional copy of this gene is present in its canonical position between nad <dig> and rrnl genes , and that there are several mismatches in the acceptor arm that might compromise the correct folding into a typical cloverleaf structure, we believe that trnlp may represent the molecular trace of an older duplication event that occurred during the evolution of this species . it is noteworthy that this genomic region is also subject to molecular rearrangments in other collembolan species  or shows intergenic spacers similar to those observed in c. antarcticus . this observation suggests that the dna fragment encompassing cob and nad <dig> may represent a "hot spot" for rearrangements in the collembolan mitochondrial genome, and that either several taxa have independently undergone rearrangements or these have occurred before the differentiation of the major collembolan lineages.

it is well known that trna genes are more prone to translocations than protein coding genes, with "hot spots" of rearrangement being described in some lineages  <cit> . in the case of the collembolan mtdna, we speculate that a replication error  may have generated an intermediate state with at least a duplicated copy of the trnl gene. afterwards, the superfluous copy may have been transformed into a pseudogene, whereas the original copy could have conserved its functionality . presently, it is only possible to conclude that: 1) similar  intergenic spacers have been also found in two species of the genus campodea , another basal hexapod group probably as primitive as collembola; 2) the gene junction trns/nad <dig> corresponds to the shift of the coding polarity between two blocks of genes  oriented on the j-strand, and nad1-trnl-rrnl-trnv-rrns on the n-strand). interestingly, experiments conducted on transcriptional termination factors in d. melanogaster have identified the positions of some binding sites that are responsible for the control of multiple transcription units on the mtdna of this species  <cit> . one of the most interesting results of these studies is that, unlike human, and along with sea urchin mtdna  <cit> , in drosophila one of these terminator sites is not located at the 3'-end of the ribosomal genes. conversely, two stretches of non-coding sequence would correspond to the binding sites for the drosophila mitochondrial transcription termination factor , a nuclear-encoded protein involved in the processes of attenuation and/or termination of mrna transcripts  <cit> . intriguingly, the short stretches of non-coding sequences identified in drosophila as dmttf binding sites are located at the gene junctions trne/trnf and trns/nad <dig>  in the same positions where c. antarcticus shows intergenic spacers . not only their position is identical, but also these sequences are located in a position of abrupt shift in the transcription polarity of the mtdna genes . nevertheless, the non-coding regions of drosophila and c. antarcticus, show no discernible sign of homology, leaving open the question of whether they do play the same role. it should be noted, however, the signalling role may be played by secondary structure motifs, like those observed between trns and nad <dig> in collembola and diplura mtdnas, rather than primary sequence.

repeats and palindromic sequences
two perfect palindromic sequences were observed. one is  <dig> bp long and spans the junction between the nad <dig> and trnw . the second is  <dig> bp long and lies  <dig> bp from the 3'end of rrns .

three repeated sequences were found in different areas of the genome. one is  <dig> bp long and encompasses the initial part of both trnl and trnl , from base  <dig> to base  <dig> . interestingly, although duplication and remolding events of leucine trna genes have probably occurred independently several times within some major animal lineages  <cit> , the observed  <dig> bp-long fragment is highly conserved in all collembolan species investigated  suggesting that primary sequence and precise conformation of this region is important for the building of both trna genes and/or for their interaction with the ribosomal complex.

a second perfect direct repeated sequence,  <dig> bp long, is observed at  <dig> bp from the 3'-end of rrns , and at  <dig> bp from the 3'-end of nad <dig> . a partially overlapping sequence of  <dig> bp is also repeated in inverted orientation in the middle of the a+t-rich region.

base composition and codon usage
the mtdna of many arthropod lineages is characterized by a strong compositional bias showing high values of a% and t% vs. g% and c%. this trend in nucleotide composition  is remarkable in some insect groups  and, to a lesser extent, is also apparent in the more basal hexapod lineages  <cit> . the c. antarcticus mtdna is  <dig> % a+t-rich, and therefore in the range observed for other collembolan species   <cit> . the observed a+t content strongly influences the use of two- and four-fold degenerate synonymous sites in protein coding genes, with relaxed pressure probably responsible for the most frequent use of nna and nnu codons .

another remarkable molecular feature of metazoan mtdnas is the asymmetry in the composition of the nucleotide content between the two strands  <cit> . usually, a% and c% are higher than t% and g% on the j-strand , whereas the reverse is observed in the n-strand . asymmetry in nucleotide composition among strands may be due to the peculiar replication and transcription mechanisms  <cit> . in mammals, it has been demonstrated that the duplication of the mitochondrial genome  is asynchronous and requires extensive displacement of the h strand, that therefore transiently is found in a single-strand state . the longer the time this strand is unpaired during replication , the more pronounced is the compositional asymmetry between h and l strands  <cit> . in the few cases where mtdna replication has been studied in insects , the mechanism is also "more asynchronous" given that both origins of replication  are located in the a+t-rich region   <cit> , and synthesis of the major coding strand begins after 97% of the minor strand has been replicated  <cit> . being the n-strand, during its single-stranded status, more prone to deaminations than double stranded dna, aâg and câu transitions are more likely to occurr. this mutational pressure generates inequalities in the nucleotide composition between the two strands with positive at-skew and cg-skew values resulting on the j-strand  <cit> .

remarkable strand compositional biases have been previously observed in the mtdna of some basal hexapod lineages  <cit> . in the j-strand of the c. antarcticus cytosines are always more frequent than guanines, leading to a positive cg-skew . conversely, the at-skew is only moderately positive, as calculated over the entire genome  and in iii codon positions of the j-strand pcgs , or negative, as calculated over entire pcgs . on the other hand, remarkable negative values of at and cg skew are observed on the n-strand . this latter bias may be due to the high frequency of mutational events leading to deamination of a and g nucleotides of the displaced n-strand, occurring during the replication of mtdna. different rates of transitions  may have eventually led to the asymmetry  of nucleotide composition and to the higher t% vs a% of pcgs oriented on the n-strand.

in this respect, the frequency of adenines and thymines is approximately equal in the genes encoded on the j-strand, whereas a higher percentage of a vs t  is observed in those oriented on the n-strand . if the strand displacement model of mtdna replication described in mammals and drosophila also holds for collembola, we can speculate that the block of genes spanning from rrns to trnf ; figures  <dig> and 3) is more prone to the deamination type câu than the opposite strand , and that transitions between c and t are more frequent than those between a and g. perhaps this trend, observed only in the pcgs oriented on the n-strand, is dependent on a higher number of mutations occurring during transcription, rather than replication, and is consequently less etched in the pcgs encoded on the j-strand. in addition, it has been demonstrated that cytosine is the most unstable of the four bases and the number of c deaminations is more pronounced in single-strand dnas  <cit> .

the asymmetrical directional mutation pressure  <cit>  observed in the two strands strongly influences the codon usage of pcgs oriented in opposite directions  <cit> . in this respect, nna and nnc codons are more frequent than nnu and nng in the pcgs encoded on the j-strand, whereas the n-strand genes show exactly the opposite trend . codon usage may also be influenced by other molecular processes such as translational selection efficiency and accuracy  <cit> , which apparently have a stronger influence in organisms with rapid growth rates  <cit> . in addition, recent analyses of codon usage in four-fold degenerate codons of mammal and fish mtdnas have demonstrated that there are context-dependent mutational effects . in this respect, the second codon position base strongly influences the presence of a specific nucleotide at fourfold degenerate sites, and these latter are not independent from the first-position nucleotide of the following codon  <cit> .

nucleotide variability of collembolan mitochondrial pcgs
the nucleotide variability of each mitochondrial pcg has been estimated calculating gene-by-gene average values of genetic distances , across all collembolan taxa for which full  mtdnas are available . distances values are higher for nad <dig>  nad <dig> and cob, suggesting these genes to be the least conserved ones in the mtdna of collembola. conversely, the more conserved mitochondrial genes are some of the cytochrome family  and nad <dig>  the distribution of the observed nucleotide variability is somewhat difficult to explain. however, according to the proposed model of mtdna replication mechanism , the genes located in the vicinity of the a+t-rich region remain for a longer time in a single-strand state during the mtdna replication and therefore are more exposed to hydrolytic and oxidative damages  <cit> . this interpretation could explain the high levels of divergence observed for nad <dig>  in addition, sites for the attenuation of the mtdna transcription mechanism  <cit>   may also be important to increase the mutation load for neighbour genes. collectively, these dna fragments are probably more prone to higher substitution rates than the others due to their position along the mtdna, although no experimental study has been performed to sustain this hypothesis. alternatively, structural constraints at the protein level may result in site-specific selective pressures acting differently and in a scattered manner along the mitochondrial genome, with some genes bearing a higher mutational load than others.

CONCLUSIONS
the description and analysis of the complete mtdna genome sequence of c. antarcticus has led to new insights on the mitogenomics of the group, and significantly added to our knowledge on mitochondrial genomes from species adapted to the antarctic terrestrial ecosystem. several peculiarities, such as nucleotide and strand-specific compositional bias, the occurrence of truncated stop codons of pcgs and the presence of mismatches and/or incomplete trna arms, have been observed. however, no distinguishing molecular features can be associated with adaptation to the extreme polar environment. the gene order is canonical, but two unusual and large non-coding regions were observed in sites of abrupt shift of the coding polarity. such intergenic spacers may contain the regulatory signals involved in the replication and/or transcription of the mtdna, although additional data will be needed to better clarify their function. segments of these intergenic regions can apparently be folded in typical cloverleaf structures, and probably represent duplicated vestigial versions of at least one trna gene. this feature seems to be shared by other collembolan mtdnas, suggesting that the gene junction trns/cob may represent a "hot spot" for gene rearrangements in collembola.
