BACKGROUND
synonymous codon usage bias  refers to the different frequency of synonymous codons in coding dna. the triplets coding for the same amino acid are not equally used for protein expression, either among different organisms or the genes from a single species. the bias ensures that the most frequently used codons, the optimal codons, can pair with the anticodons of the most abundant trna genes  <cit> . and it also avoids the mis-incorporation of amino acids to reduce processing errors. it reveals a balance between natural selection  and mutation bias , as well as the influence of random genetic drift  <cit> . therefore, understanding the codon usage bias can show the codon usage pattern of species, and provide evidence about the evolution of organisms. many previous studies suggest that there are various factors related to scub, determined by mutational bias alone or by both mutation bias and natural selection  <cit> . for instance, the driving force of the bias in many mammals has been proved to be mutational bias  <cit> , whereas some others believed that the natural selection determines the bias in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> .

the domesticated silkworm, bombyx mori , which belongs to the bombycidae family, is a well-studied model species of the lepidopteran model system with a rich repertoire of genetic information about morphology, development, and behavior  <cit> . previous studies investigating b. mori have primarily focused on the cloning, expression and characterization of some important genes  <cit> , as well as applied research such as bioreactor  <cit>  or antivirus  <cit> . in addition, there are also some studies on its evolution, which reveal that the domesticated silkworm derives from chinese stock rather than japanese or korean stock  <cit> . with the completion of the whole genome sequence of b. mori  <cit> , more molecular genetic resources can be used to illuminate the evolution history.

originally, the classification of species was based on the observed morphology and behaviors. later, a new taxonomic method called dna barcoding was created that uses a short genetic marker in an organism’s dna to identify it as belonging to a particular species  <cit> . however, it has been found that genes coded by genomic dna  seldom fit the standards of dna barcode when compared to the genes from mitochondrial dna . as the only genetic material outside gdna, mtdna is relatively small in size, extremely easy to amplify  <cit>  and highly conservative, lacks extensive recombination, has maternal inheritance and shows a relatively high evolutionary rate and non-tissue specificity  <cit> . thus, mtdna is well used as a molecular marker in species identification, population genetics, systematic phylogeny and evolutionary studies  <cit> .

the mtdna of insects is a self-replicating, circular dna molecule of about 14–20 kb in size, encoding a conserved set of  <dig> genes  and an a + t-rich segment known as control region  <cit> . currently there are more than  <dig> species of insects whose mtdna sequences have been determined . hence, a combination of mtdna and codon bias in b. mori might help us to understand the evolutionary relationships among the lepidopteran species from another angle.

to test the above possibility, the primary aim of this study is to determine the factors contributing to the codon preference of mtdna in b. mori. the results show that natural selection plays a major role in shaping the codon usage bias, while mutation bias only plays a minor role. additionally, the evolutionary relationship of the species shown in our study is different from that of the traditional classification. a detailed and modified analysis based on mtdna bias might offer a better understanding into the evolutionary relationships among the lepidopteran insects.

RESULTS
the codon usage pattern of gdna and mtdna in b. mori
the rscu values and the number of each codon in the gdna and mtdna of b. mori are shown in table  <dig>  the codon usage frequency and the correspondent rscu values were acquired from the codon usage database . it is found that codon preference happens both in the gdna and the mtdna. the gc content of the whole  <dig> cds’s  in the gdna is  <dig> %, while the values for the gc1s, gc2s and gc3s are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. however, the gc content of  <dig> cds’s  is  <dig> % in mtdna, and only  <dig> % for the gc3s. clearly, there are multiple differences within the gc contents between the gdna and the mtdna. and the frequency of codons ending with a/t is higher than that of g/c in the mtdna. this may be due to the structure of the at rich segments, and in turn leads to the higher codon bias.table  <dig>

normally, if the frequency value of a relative synonymous codon is over 60% or  <dig>  times out to the average synonymous codon value of the group, it can be defined as the high frequency codon  <cit> . in the gdna, only three high frequency codons  are found. at the same time, the other  <dig> preferentially used codons are also labeled . however,  <dig> codons with high frequency are observed in the mtdna. among them, seven codons show a similar bias level, including aaa , cct , aca , gct , aga , gaa  and caa . in the mtdna, there are also some codons  that are seldom used, and several codons which are never used, such as ctc, tag and cgc .

our results reveal that the codon bias level of the gdna is relatively lower than that of the mtdna in b. mori. the high bias of the mtdna might be derived from the evolution system of mitochondrion. as we know, the evolution patterns of mtdna and gdna are not identical. there are two main theories about the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria at present. one of the theories suggests that the eukaryote engulfed the mitochondrion  <cit> , while the other posits that the prokaryote host acquired the mitochondrion. as a relatively independent organelle inside the cell, early studies used to assume that mtdna undergoes neutral evolution  <cit> . however, later findings have denied those findings, and it is now believed that mtdna suffers from positive and negative selection  <cit> . an abundance of evidences supports the existence of co-evolution and co-adaption between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . however, different substitution rates have been confirmed between them, where the mtdna shows a higher rate of nucleotide substitution than that of the gdna  <cit> . thus, the higher rate of substitution might be related to the higher codon bias in the mtdna.

correspondence analysis of codon bias
there are various reasons contributing to codon usage bias, including gene function, compositional constraints of genes, translational selection, the secondary structure of proteins, natural selection, and mutation bias  <cit> . different substitutions suggest that mtdna has experienced the non-uniform selective pressures  <cit> . thus, the correspondence analysis of codons usage may help us to investigate the possible factors that cause the bias in the mtdna of b. mori. here, a set of indices were calculated, including g + c content, the content of bases in the third position , and indices inflecting the codon bias level , as well as the gene function indices .

similar to the results of rscu, the effective number of codons  in b. mori ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> , indicating a high-level codon bias in mtdna. in addition, most of the trnas in mtdna are known as inactive areas and have almost no enc value, excluding the genes encoded trna-thr, trna-lys, trna-ile. the absence of values might be a result of the extraordinarily short sequences which are unable to rightly encode enough amino acid, according to the definition of enc and the calculation of codonw  <cit> .

based on the  <dig> synonymous codons, a set of  <dig> genes were represented by the points in a super dimensional axes and carried on to the correspondence analysis. contributions of the axes were shown  and we arrived at a four main contributors which were axis <dig>  axis <dig>  axis <dig> and axis <dig>  the first two-main-dimensional coordinates, axis <dig> and axis <dig>  can explain  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total variation, while axis <dig> and axis <dig> explain  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, which led to the first axis as the major contributor to the codon bias. the location of the genes marked in the two-dimensional coordinate after the correspondence analysis of  <dig> genes. the position of the at ended codons are more close to axis <dig> than the gc ending codons with a concentrate distribution , indicating that the base composition for mutation bias might correlate to the codon bias. while the genes with different gc content  showed a relatively regular distribution, and lower gc content gene located more close to axis <dig> , implying that gc content for mutation pressure probably influenced the bias. in addition, a considerable amount of the genes are in a discrete distribution, indicating that there are many other factors that exist, for example, natural selection.figure  <dig>

in order to intuitively display the indices related to the four main contributors, correlations of the important indices were calculated to determine the important factors that result in codon bias .table  <dig>

significant correlations are found in the indices. gc3s shows the significant correlation with axis <dig> and enc  suggesting that the base composition for mutation bias might have an impact on the codon bias. the first axis also shows the significant linear correlation with l_aa . meanwhile, there is also a significant correlation between l_aa and enc , revealing that gene length might affect the codon bias too. in addition, l_aa contains a negative correlation with gc3s , but strong positive linear correlation with enc , which might give an assumption to the usage of synonymous codons suffered from the natural selection in the exact gene.

natural selection influences the codon bias of mtdna
a neutrality plot was drawn to estimate the extent of directional mutation pressure against selection in the codon usage bias of mtdna. the neutrality plot  reveals the results of “equilibrium coefficient” of mutation and selection. gc <dig> is the average value of gc <dig> and gc <dig>  the regression coefficient of gc <dig> to gc <dig> of mtdna is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , indicating the relative neutrality is  <dig>  % while the relative constraint is  <dig>  % for gc <dig>  in figure  <dig>  the points are not located to the diagonal distribution  and the values of gc <dig> are in a narrow distribution, indicating gc <dig> and gc <dig> are definitely not the mutation bias model  <cit> . on the other hand, the regression curve  tended to be sloped or parallel to the horizontal axis. the subsequent correlation analysis reveals little correlation between gc <dig> and gc <dig>  accordingly, mutation bias might just play a minor role in shaping the codon bias, whereas natural selection seems to probably dominate the codon bias.figure  <dig> 
gc <dig> against gc <dig> value of each gene. gc <dig> stands for the average value of gc content in the first and second position of the codons , while gc <dig> refers to the gc content in the third position. the diagonalin and the regression curve were colored in red and green, respectively. the regression curve can describe as y = − <dig> x +  <dig> , r2 =  <dig> , and gc <dig> showed no correlation with gc <dig> 



mutation bias plays a minor role in the codon usage bias of mtdna
to further confirm whether mutation bias plays a relatively minor role in effecting the codon bias as deduced above, the enc values were plotted against the gc <dig> values in enc-plot  <cit>  . the standard curve shows the functional relationship between enc and gc3s is under mutation pressure rather than selection. in this case, if codon usage bias is completely based on gc3s, all the points will lie exactly on the standard curve . for instance, the point of the gene 1-rrna is in the plot just located on the curve, showing its codon bias is only or mainly affected by mutation pressure. however, most of the points do not lie close to the standard curve, which indicates that the gc3s for mutation bias is not the main factor in shaping the codon bias. for the points corresponding to different genes which show a discrete distribution, it implies other factors such as natural selection for gene length and gene expression level may also influence the codon bias to a certain extent.figure  <dig> 
enc analysis of each gene plotted against gc3s. the standard curve in red point in the figure showed the functional relation between enc and gc3s is under mutation pressure without selection. points on or close to the curve means bias caused by mutation pressure. otherwise, they are affected by natural selection or other factors.



it is generally acknowledged that codon preference reflects a balance between mutational bias and natural selection for translational optimization. in other words, natural selection and mutational bias are the two main factors leading to codon usage bias  <cit> . so far, combined with the neutrality plot, it shows that the scub of mtdna is mainly dominated by natural selection, and mutational pressure only lightly affects the usage bias. similarly, in many other species, such as arabidopsis thaliana, drosophila melanogaster or caenorhabditis elegans, natural selection also plays a more important role in forming the codon bias of the whole genome  <cit> .

gene length correlated to expression level causing the codon bias of mtdna
ribosome genes of b. mori were used as a reference set to calculate the cai value of the genes. correlation analysis indicates that cai is positive correlation against axis <dig>  and strong negative correlation with enc values . thus, gene expression level is thought to be a factor for causing the bias. furthermore, the correlation between cai and gene length is significant  , indicating that gene length is related to expression level, although a few people believed that cai and enc were not correlated to the length of genes  <cit> . additionally, the average cai values of  <dig> protein-coded genes range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , a level close to  <dig> , which might give an assumption that a relatively high expression level of the genes according to the index definition. the results are similar to previous studies  <cit> . however, it was necessary to investigate more data in order to identify that the  <dig> protein-coding genes in mitogenome of b. mori are highly expressed.figure  <dig> 
cai against gene length  of the coding genes. the regression curve can be described as y = −3 × 10−6x2 +  <dig> x +  <dig> , r2 =  <dig> . the black point, white up triangle, and red triangle refer to trna gene, coding protein and rrna gene respectively.



both est-based and new quantitative measures of gene expression  suggest that codon preference is strongly associated with gene expression derived from the information on trna abundance  <cit> . analysis about the bias might be of great importance to study gene expression, gene function, and even the evolution of the species since scub is considered to be an outcome of natural selection, mutation bias or genetic drift  <cit> . thus, our analysis reveals that the high expression levels of the coded proteins making up the respiratory chain in mitochondrion meet well with the high energy demand to fit the life system. the process is recognized by the species containing abundant trna  <cit> . large amount of trnas existing in the mitochondrion can also explain the high codon bias of mtdna of b. mori. in addition, translational selection and translational efficiency also play a role in the natural selection towards codon bias. it is observed that long genes are highly expressed in yersinia pestis  <cit> , while the shorter genes have a better expression in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . this indicates the existence of translational selection and probably that the translational efficiency acts negatively in yersinia pestis, but positively in drosophila melanogaster in shaping the scub for the reason that high codon bias always appears in the highly expressed genes  <cit> . our analysis suggests that gene length does play a role in shaping the bias and shows strong correlation with the gene expression level. therefore we conclude that the translational efficiency is possibly a positive factor to cause the bias and the translational selection might also influence scub in mtdna of b. mori.

factors such as gene length, translational selection and translational efficiency can be due to the natural selection pressure that causes the scub in mtdna of b. mori. the index gravy correlated to the axis <dig> might also be suggested as an aspect of the selection pressure in shaping the bias. however, indices which reflect the mutation pressure show little correlation with the primary axes, except gc3s. combined with the neutrality plot and enc- plot, the results suggest that it is natural selection rather than mutation pressure that dominates the scub in mtdna of b. mori.

the species classification based on the mtdna scub
 <dig> neolepidoptera species were used for the cluster analysis, included in five superfamilies  and  <dig> families, using the rscu values from correspondence analysis of the  <dig> cdss in each mitogenome. the cluster analysis to bombyx and other species with a relatively near genetic distance in lepidoptera reveals that all the species are divided into two big clusters at the evolution distance of about  <dig> . b. mori and bombyx mandarina stay the closest and are isolated almost from the root. while the other species in the bombycoidea family known as have close relationship with the bombyx are divided into another branch. thus another branch is divided into several clades in turn. however, species in the same color are in a discrete distribution, although several small numbers of species gather together. the results appear largely different from the previous studies  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
cluster analysis of the  <dig> species in lepidoptera based on the codon usage value of mtdna. where five superfamilies are in different colors: bombycoidea , papilionoidea , noctuoidea , geometroidea , hepialoidea .



however, almost all of the species in different families are in a similar mean value of enc, gc content and gc3s . hence, we can hardly classify the species according to the codon usage indicies, except the clade of b. mori and bombyx mandarina which has extremely lower enc value from the other species. thus, the codon usage of mitogenome might trace a different evolutionary path from the way of species evolution. it could be also assumed that codon bias might determine the mitochondrial genome in a specific way and transcend the boundary of phylogenetic relationships of species  <cit> .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
many factors can result in the synonymous codon usage bias of organisms. for the mtdna of b. mori, natural selection is found to dominate the high scub. and we believe that mutation bias only plays a relatively minor role. moreover, our study provides new insight into the exploration of setting up new methods for species taxonomy, though a trial still needs to be conducted in the future.
