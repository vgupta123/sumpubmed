BACKGROUND
genomic control of primary calcitriol-responsive genes is primarily achieved by binding of  vitamin d receptor -retinoid x receptor  heterodimers in a non-symmetrical head to tail arrangement to vitamin d response elements  located within the promotor regions of target genes  <cit> . corepressor proteins such as hairless, alien, ncor  or smrt  link non-liganded dna-bound vdr or antagonist-destabilized nuclear hormone receptor -coactivator complexes to enzymes with histone deacetylase  activity and as a result promote condensation of chromatin to repress basal transcription  <cit> . the binding of calcitriol or one of its agonists triggers the release of corepressors, accompanied by subsequent recruitment of coactivators of the p <dig> family and finally of more general cofactors such as cbp/p <dig> to mediate local chromatin remodeling and stable assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery  <cit> . secondly, calcitriol can also mediate ‘rapid responses’ that are elicited by still debatable receptor located near or associated with the plasma membrane and its caveolae compartments  <cit> . these effects occur within minutes after hormone administration, are too rapid to involve changes in gene expression but instead direct an increase in numerous second messengers that can, though, ultimately affect transcription through secondary cross-talk with other  signal transduction cascades  <cit> .

despite an already substantial quantity of literature on vdr biology - for example, 1α,25- dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> signaling; classification of agonistic/antagonistic vdr ligands synthesized with the goal to improve the biological profile of the natural hormone for therapeutic application; descriptions of associations between vdr and a variety of interactors as listed in the primos  and biogrid  database; as well as descriptions of structural motifs and conformational changes responsible for transcriptional control - there remain important regulatory aspects and mechanisms that have not been comprehensively elucidated.

by performing a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid  screen using human vdr as bait in order to detect new protein-protein interactions  to obtain a more complete understanding of the mode of action of vdr, we were able to identify a previously unknown binding partner, pim- <dig> . pim- <dig> , which is a serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase  family, phosphorylates different downstream effectors and has accordingly been proposed to play a key role in cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and differentiation of a variety of cell types  <cit> . here we identify pim- <dig> kinase as a novel vdr interacting protein whose overexpression significantly enhances and knock-down suppresses both, endogenous calcitriol response gene transcription  and an extrachromosomal dr <dig>  reporter response. these findings suggest involvement of the vdr-pim- <dig> interaction in calcitriol-mediated growth and especially differentiation of keratinocytes.

RESULTS
genome-wide screening of a human cdna library for vdr interacting proteins delivered pim- <dig> kinase as candidate interactor
to identify novel interactors of human vdr we carried out a y2h assay by screening full length human vdr against a bone marrow cdna library contained in the pad-gate <dig> to  <dig> vector system, as described by maier et al. <cit> . from approximately 5 ×  <dig> yeast transformants we recovered a total of  <dig> different positive clones expressing putative vdr interactors. we concentrated our efforts on one clone encoding a carboxy-terminal fragment of pim- <dig> kinase , as determined via homology searches using ncbi blast. however, prior to further experimentation we first demonstrated the existence of pim-1 mrna in hacat keratinocytes by using gene-specific real-time pcr primers ; this positive result indicated that our newly identified protein-protein interaction could plausibly take place not only in human bone-marrow but also in human skin cells.

the vdr dna-binding domain is a pim- <dig> interaction site
we isolated full-length human pim- <dig> kinase from the cdna library using gateway-compatible oligonucleotides and then subcloned the cdna into pad-gate <dig> via standard bp-/lr-reactions. now, using the full-length pim- <dig> clone, we repeated the y2h test against vdr and confirmed the positive interaction. to determine the vdr regions potentially involved in pim- <dig> binding, we subcloned the vdr fragment encoding the dna-binding domain and the fragment encoding the ligand-binding domain  separately into the vector pbd-gate <dig> for y2h screening against full-length pim- <dig> as well as the truncated pim- <dig> or appropriate negative controls . yeast cells co-transformed with the vdr lbd and either full-length pim- <dig> isoform  <dig> or truncated pim- <dig>  failed to grow on sd/-trp-leu-ade-his medium, whereas cells expressing both the vdr dna-binding domain and pim- <dig> kinase did grow . this result indicates that the pim- <dig> binding site of vdr maps to the fragment encoding the vdr dna-binding domain.

in silico examination of human pim- <dig> kinase revealed the presence of a putative nuclear hormone receptor coregularoty lxxll motif, namely l228-g-i-l231-l <dig> , within the minimal vdr interaction domain. the general trend for lxxll motifs  that mediate the association between cofactors and liganded nuclear hormone receptors to modulate transcription includes a hydrophobic residue positioned at − <dig> and − <dig>  a proline residue at − <dig>  an aromatic residue at − <dig> and glutamate at location − <dig> to create an l-x-e/h-x-h/f-p-l/m/i-l-x-x-l-l consensus pattern  <cit> ; however, the pim- <dig> sequence in this stretch is r-s-a-a-v-w-s-l228-g-i-l231-l <dig>  although the aa residues flanking the lxxll main core motif are known to be important for the recognition of selected classes of nuclear hormone receptors, the exact number and composition of lxxll motifs can vary considerably among different coactivators  <cit> .

pim- <dig> kinase and vdr colocalize in the nucleus of hacat keratinocytes
mammalian expression constructs for yfp-vdr and red fluorescent pim- <dig> were used to transfect cultured hacat keratinocytes to visualize the subcellular localization of vdr and pim- <dig>  and to evaluate the influence of 200 nm calcitriol  on this distribution. yfp-tagged vdr was observed to be predominantly located in the nucleus independent of calcitriol treatment and residually in the cytoplasm. this result differs from previous studies, which reported that unliganded vdr partitions consistently between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as observed in a variety of cell types such as cos- <dig> cells deficient in expressing endogenous vdr, cv- <dig> fibroblasts, rat ros17/ <dig>  osteosarcoma cells, mouse adenocarcinoma cells,  <dig> adenovirus-transformed human embryonal kidney cells, and human dermal fibroblasts, and undergoes substantial translocation into the nucleus upon calcitriol treatment  <cit> . real-time pcr experiments analyzing expression of cyp24a <dig> or opn, which are well known vdr-target genes as well as western blots of lysates of untransfected hacat cells in comparison to yfp-vdr-overexpressing samples  have in this context confirmed that the tagged nuclear hormone receptor is fully functional.

pim- <dig> kinase also was observed to be predominantly nuclear, however, not throughout the complete nucleus. a dense concentration of pim- <dig> in an undefined local nuclear region  was observed, where it patially colocalizes with vdr in hacat keratinocytes . a residual cytoplasmic staining was also observed. its intracellular distribution was not obviously influenced by the presence or absence of calcitriol . previous studies have described both cytoplasmic and especially nuclear pim- <dig> localization, as visualized via biochemical cell fractionation studies  <cit> , transfection of a gfp-tagged pim- <dig> kinase into hela cells  <cit> , or anti-pim- <dig> antibody staining approaches  <cit> ; in the latter study the kinase was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus at an early stage of u <dig> pma -induced cell differentiation but then underwent a dramatic shift toward the nucleus after 24 h of exposure to this substance.

pim- <dig> kinase is not a classical calcitriol target gene
to further evaluate the behaviour of pim- <dig> kinase upon the treatment with calcitriol, total rna extracted from cultured hacat keratinocytes as well as 293hek  cells that had been exposed to 200 nm calcitriol  for 16 h was reverse transcribed into cdna and subjected to real-time pcr analysis. the rna expression levels were observed with gene-specific primers chosen according to the published sequences of human pim- <dig>  cyp24a <dig> , a typical positive control target gene whose perceived upregulations were in accordance to recent publications  <cit> , and anxa <dig> as internal reference gene. melting curve examinations, agarose gel electrophoresis and dna-sequencing determined that the amplified products were indeed specific; in addition, a negative control for each rna specimen was prepared. following normalization, calcitriol induction in both cell types was evident, but no difference in the mrna levels of pim- <dig> kinase could be observed, suggesting that pim- <dig> kinase is not a calcitriol target gene .

pim- <dig> overexpression enhances mrna transcription of vdr-target genes and activates response of extrachromosomal vdr-reporter constructs calcitriol independently
in a further real-time pcr experiment, we analyzed the effect of overexpression of pim- <dig> kinase on osteopontin  and cyp24a <dig>  mrna levels in the absence of calcitriol treatment; the expression level of anxa <dig> was used as an internal control. the results, presented in figure  <dig>  clearly show that both opn and cyp <dig> mrna levels are increased by pim- <dig> overexpression , suggesting that pim- <dig> kinase overexpression provokes an calcitriol-independent enhancement of opn and cyp <dig> transcription mediated by vdr. because it is conceivable that the endogenous activation of transcription we observed is mediated through epigenetic mechanisms, we also tested a commercially available extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter construct designed for accurate, sensitive and quantitative assessment of the activation of signal transduction pathways, bears no other interaction sites for additional transcription factors, and hence confirms that a direct stimulation through vdr binding takes place. for this purpose we co-transfected pim- <dig> kinase construct with an equal amount of a vdre-luc reporter construct into hacat cells, treated half of the samples with calcitriol and then performed a dual-luciferase® reporter assay in which we detected firefly as well as renilla luciferase signals with a luminometer. following normalization of the obtained firefly values by the recorded renilla signals, we observed a greatly increased calcitriol-stimulated luciferase signal of about  <dig> -fold in pim-1-overexpressing samples compared to cells transfected with an empty expression vector . because the cells treated with ethanol showed the same enhancement in the luciferase signal compared to calcitriol induction, we conclude from these studies that overexpression of pim- <dig> in hacat cells is able to enhance both the calcitriol-independent and calcitriol-dependent extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter response.

pim- <dig> dependence of vdr mediated transcriptional response was shown by knockdown of endogenous pim-1
to show pim- <dig> dependence of vdr-promoter binding and response gene activation, we knocked down pim- <dig> expression by rnai and analysed transcriptional activation of extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter construct. therefore pim- <dig> specific short hairpin rna  encoding plasmids were co-transfected with an equal amount of a vdre-luc reporter construct into hacat cells. the transfected cells were treated half with calcitriol and then a dual-luciferase® reporter assay was performed. the knockdown of endogenous pim- <dig> results in a reduced calcitriol-stimulated luciferase signal to the half compared to the control transfection . the fact that in calcitriol-independent signalling the shrna construct against pim- <dig> shows about the same reduction compared to the negative control support the theory that pim- <dig> is able to enhance extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter response independ of calcitriol.

pim- <dig> kinase was found to take part in the vdr-interacting protein complex of human cells
to verify the interaction between pim- <dig> and vdr a pull-down of drip  complex from cell lysates was performed.

therefore a human keratinocyte lysate was prepared and incubated with a biotinylated synthetic vdr specific lxxll nuclear receptor binding motif peptide, drip <dig>  <cit> . the biotinylated drip- <dig> peptide was immobilized using magnetic streptavidin beads. the vdr complex from human keratinocytes was captured by the immobilized drip- <dig> peptide . as a control for unspecific binding a lysate without drip- <dig> was incubated with the beads. the resulting eluates were analyzed by western blotting with an anti-vdr and an anti-pim1-antibody .

vdr as well as pim- <dig> isoform  <dig> could be detected in the vdr-protein complex from human keratinocyte cell lysates captured by the drip- <dig> peptide. furthermore, an unspecific protein band appeared which is about the size of an putative vdr/pim- <dig> complex . despite the denaturing conditions of sds gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis there is still the possibility of an remaining vdr/pim- <dig> complex which would be a further evidence for real interaction. in the control neither vdr nor pim- <dig> was detected.

discussion
the present study reports a previously unknown protein-protein interaction between human vdr and pim- <dig> kinase and an involvement of a futher kinase in calcitriol signaling. vdr is an evolutionarily conserved member of the hormone-responsive nhr superfamily, expressed in malignant specimens  and numerous mammalian tissues and, most crucially for our study, in bone and skin where it can be detected in a variety of cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, langerhans cells, melanocytes, endothelial cells, and b- and t-lymphocytes  <cit> .

pim- <dig>  originally identified as a locus frequently activated by proviral insertion of the moloney murine leukemia virus  <cit> , encodes a highly conserved  <dig> aa serine/threonine kinase of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated kinase  family whose expression is stimulated by a variety of cytokines, hormones and mitogens. pim- <dig> appears to be involved in the control of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and malignant transformation  <cit> . putative pim- <dig> kinase substrates and interactors include the c-myb transcription factor nuclear adapter protein p <dig>  <cit> , the g1-specific cell-cycle regulator cdc25a  <cit> , hp <dig>  <cit> , the cdk inhibitor p21cip1/waf <dig> <cit> , the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein numa  <cit>  and the proapoptotic protein bad  <cit> , which are to a large extent involved in regulating cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. nevertheless, the altogether small number of reported substrates would seem unlikely to be able to account for the broad spectrum of pim- <dig> kinase functions, implying that it most probably interacts with additional, to date unidentified cellular substrates in specific physiological environments.

expression of pim- <dig> occurs in a wide range of tissues: hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, hippocampus and oral epithelia. it is significantly upregulated in b-cell lymphomas and erythroleukemias and has, via multi-tissue northern blotting, been detected in a number of squamous cell carcinoma-derived keratinocyte lines, and in early and late passages of both spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes and normal human epidermal cells where its expression was substantially higher after confluence than during the logarithmic growth phase and correlated with increased keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . there is an obvious overlap in the expression of vdr and pim- <dig> kinase in a variety of calcitriol-responsive tissues.

support for the biological significance of our discovery of a physical interaction between human vdr and pim- <dig> kinase is the fact that most nuclear hormone receptors are phosphoproteins , whereby phosphorylation status can apparently govern receptor activity under the prevailing cellular conditions. human vdr has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase c  at serine  <dig> in the α-helical region that forms the two zinc fingers  <cit>  and by protein kinase a  at serine  <dig>  <cit> , which together attenuate the receptor’s vdre-binding, rxr heterodimerization and transactivation functions. conversely, calcitriol-stimulated, casein kinase ii-catalyzed phosphorylation of human vdr at serine  <dig>  <cit>  does not affect the receptor’s kinetics for hormone binding, its partitioning into the nucleus or its ability to associate with dna but instead modulates its affinity for the 220 mw drip205/trap <dig> subunit of the large drip  mediator complex that directly anchors liganded vdr to components of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme and hence amplifies its ability to transactivate target promoters. in addition, activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase camkiv, which exhibits 30% identity and 45% similarity to pim- <dig> , dramatically stimulates calcitriol-activated reporter gene expression by increasing vdr phosphorylation levels and results in enhanced interaction between vdr and src coactivator proteins in mammalian two-hybrid studies  <cit> . calcitriol also activates mitogen-activated protein  kinases in normal human keratinocytes  <cit>  and other cell types  <cit> , thereby providing a rapid mechanism for the hormone to promote its own receptor-mediated action and suggesting a possible connection between the well-established gene regulatory mechanisms mediated through the vdr and the rapid response cascades. functional studies on other steroid hormone and retinoid receptors have similarly implicated phosphorylation in the regulation of dna association  <cit> , hormone binding  <cit> , nuclear localization  <cit>  and transcriptional activation  <cit> . similar modifications have also been reported for a variety of nhr coregulators, including src- <dig>  tif <dig>  rac <dig>  p <dig>  cbp, ncor and smrt  <cit> , which may either enhance their interaction with nhrs as well as their abilitiy to recruit histone acetyltransferase  complexes  or induce the redistribution of corepressor from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby lessening the potential association between corepressors and nhrs  <cit> .

our domain mapping approaches have nevertheless indicated that the interaction with pim- <dig> kinase does not involve the ligand-binding domain of vdr in contrary to the majority of co-activators. the interaction between pim- <dig> and vdr is instead restricted to the receptor’s dna binding domain, a type of interaction that, to our knowledge, has been described only  <dig> times previously:  between vdr and the bone-specific transcription factor runx <dig> as a prerequisite to upregulate rat osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts  <cit> ;  between vdr and acute promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein  necessary for the regulation of calcitriol-induced monocytic differentiation in hematopoietic cells  <cit> ; and , in a different experimental context, between vdr and the oncogenic nucleoporin can/nup <dig>  a component of the nuclear pore complex  <cit> .

because yeast two-hybrid experiments do not allow any conclusions about protein-protein interactions in a native cellular environment, we also studied pim- <dig> and vdr in the spontaneously immortalized human hacat cell line which is known to behave phenotypically like normal basal epidermal keratinocytes in terms of growth and differentiation and to develop in the absence of serum and supplementary exogenous growth factors, features which make it a widely used cell culture system for such studies and an important model for the highly proliferative epidermis  <cit> . as visualized by overexpressing yfp-vdr and tomato-tagged pim- <dig>  we could observe significant co-localization of the two proteins in the nucleus of hacat keratinocytes, which confirms that both proteins could indeed have the opportunity to interact with each other at the physiological level. we were subsequently able to increase transcription of cyp24a <dig> and osteopontin mrna, the latter a classic vdr response gene  <cit> , by approximately 50% upon extrachromosomal overexpression of pim- <dig> kinase. furthermore, we similarly observed a clear enhancement of extrachromosomal dr <dig> reporter response upon pim- <dig> overespression and respectively a clear reduction in dr <dig> reporter response by pim- <dig> shrna mediated knock-down, suggesting that pim- <dig> kinase indeed can modulate calcitriol signaling. in an earlier study, thompson et al. <cit>  analyzed whether pim- <dig> was capable of modulating androgen signaling because androgens are known to play a key role in male physiology as well as in the promotion or progression of prostate cancer and pim- <dig> kinase was reported to be markedly overexpressed under such conditions  <cit> . ruling out simple explanations like altered receptor levels or dna binding characteristics, they observed that, under transient transfection conditions, pim- <dig> attenuated the transcriptional activity of ar, another nhr superfamily member , in a dose-dependent fashion in several cell types, but found no evidence for direct phosphorylation of ar by pim- <dig> or, in contrast to our results, for a direct protein-protein interaction  <cit> . they therefore suggested that pim- <dig> likely influences ar activity via an indirect mechanism that possibly involves phosphorylation of a coregulator and/or a component of the transcriptional machinery. we could show that pim- <dig> binds to the dna-binding domain of vdr and modulates calcitriol signaling, however, we did not analyse the phosphorylation of vdr by pim- <dig>  therefore it remains unclear whether vdr or a different component of the pathway is modulated by pim- <dig>  interestingly, and in this context it was reported that pim- <dig> enhances the transcriptional activity of c-myb, another transcription factor, by direct phosphorylating the dna-binding domain as well as the phosphorylation of the transcriptional co-activator p <dig>  <cit> .

in a final pull-down of vdr-interacting protein complexes we investigated the protein complex of vdr by using the facility of a lxxll containing peptide  to capture the vdr-interacting co-activator protein complex in cell lysates. we detected the pim- <dig> isoform  <dig> in the eluted fraction containing also vdr, but there is no detection of endogene pim- <dig> in the fraction without drip- <dig> capture, so pim- <dig> indeed seems to be included into the vdr-complex captured by drip- <dig> peptide, and potentially a member of the drip205-vdr co-activator complex  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
because the interaction between pim- <dig> kinase and vdr involves the dna-binding domain of the latter, it is conceivable that this association supports the binding of vdr to vdre response elements within specific target genes, a hypothesis that will be tested in forthcoming studies aimed at clarifying the mechanism of co-activation.
