BACKGROUND
reproduction is an indispensable function for the preservation of the species and thus is under the control of a complex network of regulatory signals. while different reproductive strategies have been developed during evolution, in mammals and other species the regulatory factors mainly originate and/or integrate at the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal  axis. in general, the function of this neuro-hormonal axis relies primarily on the dynamic interaction of three major groups of signals arising from: 1) the hypothalamus, where a small population of scattered neurons synthesize and release gonadotropin-releasing hormone ; 2) the anterior pituitary, where gonadotropes secrete the gonadotropins - luteinizing hormone , and follicle-stimulating hormone ; and finally 3) the gonads that, in addition to producing gametes, are responsible for the synthesis and release of sex steroid and peptide hormones  <cit> .

besides its dynamic regulation in adulthood , the hpg axis undergoes significant maturation and functional changes during fetal and postnatal development  <cit> , which particularly include sexual differentiation of the brain and the attainment of reproductive capacity at puberty. importantly, the above mentioned phenomena display sexual dimorphism, and substantial differences are detected between males and females in relation to the development of reproductive brain circuits, the timing of puberty, and the function of the hpg axis in adulthood  <cit> . in this circuitry, the essential contribution of several neuropeptide pathways, including prominently kisspeptin neurons, has been documented  <cit> . kisspeptin neurons are widely accepted as conduits for transmitting metabolic information onto the centers governing the reproductive axis  <cit> . in this context, the ability of high doses of leptin to increase the hypothalamic expression of kiss <dig> gene in different models of severe metabolic stress, such as the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse and the diabetic rat, fueled the hypothesis that leptin acts on kisspeptin neurons to conduct its stimulatory/permissive effects on gnrh neurons .

metabolic conditions and the amount of body fuel reserves play a key role in the attainment of puberty  <cit> . thus, the attainment of reproductive capacity is only possible if proper fuel stores and metabolic conditions are acquired. moreover, research in humans and a variety of animal models showed a link between early life nutrition and optimal reproductive function . undernutrition caused by anorexia or calorie restriction delays the onset of puberty in humans, disrupts estrous cycles, and delays the postpartum return to estrus in sexually mature animals. on the other hand, obese individuals share a phenotype similar to that of calorie-restricted individuals, i.e. a variety of alterations in the reproductive axis, including decreased fertility  <cit> . however, in contrast to undernutrition, which causes delayed puberty, childhood obesity induces precocious puberty in girls  <cit> .

evidence from human and experimental studies suggests that the timing of puberty can be affected by early metabolic influences taking place pre- or postnatally . although early life nutrition appears to be a critical requirement for optimal mammalian reproduction, the precise neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon are poorly understood. thus in the present study we hypothesized that transient undernutrition experienced at critical times during development affects the development of hypothalamic gene networks involved in the hpg circuitry as well as subsequent reproductive performance. to address this hypothesis we have used a well-established mouse model of undernutrition during lactation causing severe leptin and insulin deficiency   <cit> , to show that neonates exposed to undernutrition during lactation acquire sex-specific delays in the realization of puberty, possibly through molecular programming of the hypothalamus. since kisspeptin neural circuits develop gradually during the first 2– <dig> weeks of postnatal life  <cit> , when leptin and insulin deficiency occurs in our model, we examined hypothalamic gene networks controlling reproduction in 10- and 21-day old mice. males and females with changed hypothalamic gene networks controlling reproduction showed altered body composition, delayed puberty and disturbed reproductive performance. furthermore, our studies suggest that the molecular and physiological effects of postnatal undernutrition are multigenerational.fig.  <dig> nutritional and breeding strategy to generate the first- and second-generation offspring. newborn f <dig> mice were raised from birth to weaning under control conditions  or lactation undernutrition condition  . after weaning the f <dig> offspring from the all nutritional conditions were fed ad libitum. to generate the second-generation offspring , unrelated nonsibling f <dig> con  and lun  females  and males  were mated at age of 2 months in four combinations: c♀ x c♂, c♀ x l♂, l♀ x c♂, and l♀ x l♂ . lactating f <dig> females were not subjected to food restriction. after weaning the f <dig> offspring were fed ad libitum. red dots represent possible sites of transcriptomic and functional modifications of hpg axis related reproductive circuits. black dots – hypothalami and gonads of control animals



RESULTS
growth and body composition after undernutrition during early postnatal development
the design of the nutritional experiment, as described by kozak and coworkers  <cit> , aims to perturb body composition and hormonal homeostasis to assess attainment of puberty and patterns of gene expression in the hypothalamus of control mice  and mice with undernutrition  during lactation . neonatal undernutrition was associated with changes in growth as revealed by a significant decrease in the pre-weaning body weight of underfed compared with normal fed mice. as early as on day  <dig>  lun females  and males  had reduced body weights that persisted from weaning into adulthood .fig.  <dig> effects of undernutrition  from birth to weaning at 21 days of age on body composition, puberty attainment, pregnancy rates and litter sizes in f <dig> progeny. body weight and adiposity index  in female  and male  progeny. data are expressed as mean ± sem. means with different superscripts differ significantly , capital letters – lun). asterisks indicate difference between nutritional protocols for the same day of age . timing of vaginal opening , vaginal estrus , number of estrus before breeding , and timing of balano preputial separation  in control  and lun mice . number of pregnant females and litter parameters in first and second pregnancy  for each breeding pair 



significant differences in adiposity index in control mice compared to lun were detected at  <dig> and 21 days of age. females showed 57 % and 50 %  reduction of adiposity at  <dig> and 21 days of age, respectively . similarly, males showed 60 % and 46 %  reduction of adiposity at  <dig> and 21 days of age, respectively . uniquely, reduction of adiposity was also observed between  <dig> and 21 days of age in control males .

delayed puberty and changed reproductive performance in f <dig> progeny undernourished during early postnatal development
the onset of puberty in f <dig> females, which is typically defined as the time of vaginal opening  and first estrus, was delayed in lun mice . whereas vo occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in con mice, it occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in lun mice . similarly, the mean age of first vaginal estrus  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in normal fed mice compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in lun mice . interestingly, no significant difference in body weights at vo  and ve  were observed between normally fed animals and lun mice. correlation between body weight and age at vo was significant in both normal nourished and underfed mice . although the correlation between body weight and age at ve was significant in normal fed females , it was non-significant in lun counterparts .

not only did changes in neonatal nutrition affect the onset of puberty, they also had long-term effects on later reproductive capability. lun females displayed a reduced number of estrous cycles, as evaluated by the number of estrus before breeding .

the onset of puberty in male f <dig> progeny, which can be defined as the time of balano preputial separation , was delayed in lun males . whereas bps occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in con mice, it was observed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in lun mice . similar to the results of the experiment in female f <dig> progeny, no significant difference in body weights at bps were observed between con and lun mice . furthermore, correlation between body weight and age at bps was non-significant in both con and lun males .

percentage of pregnancy was lower in lun females when compared to con females bred with con males . interestingly, con females bred with lun males also displayed lower percentage of pregnancy . although litter sizes at birth did not differ significantly between breeding protocols, substantial improvement in litter size in second pregnancy was observed only in con females bred with con males .

hypothalamic gene expression networks altered in f <dig> progeny undernourished during early postnatal development
because kisspeptins are essential gatekeepers of proper reproductive maturation, including gating by metabolic factors  <cit>  and kisspeptin neural circuits develop gradually during the first weeks of postnatal life  <cit> , we next investigated whether neonatal undernutrition during the neonatal period impacts kisspeptin-signaling related gene expression within the hypothalamus of 10- and 21-day old mice . while in 10-day old animals there were no diet-dependent differences in leptin receptor , signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , kisspeptin  <dig>  and its receptor , and gonadotropin releasing hormone  <dig>  levels, some of these genes were significantly affected by undernutrition 11 days later. furthermore, though kiss <dig> mrna expression was down-regulated in both males and females , leprv <dig> and kiss1r were significantly up-regulated only in females . on the other hand down-regulation of stat <dig> expression was only detected in 21-day old males . an age-dependent increase of leprv <dig>  stat <dig>  and gnrh <dig> was observed in both males and females independently of the nutrition protocol . in contrast, kiss1r mrna levels were maintained constant only in control animals and lun males . uniquely, normal mechanisms for induction of kiss <dig> expression in 21-day old animals was abrogated in both lun female and male mice , with more profound changes observed in females.fig.  <dig> undernutrition  from birth to weaning at 21 days of age affects expression of kisspeptin-signaling related genes in hypothalami of female  and male  f <dig> progeny. expression levels are presented relative to ppib expression ) assessed by the real-time rt-pcr. data are expressed as mean ± sem. means with different superscripts differ significantly , capital letters – lun). asterisks indicate differences between nutritional protocols for the same day of age 



we generated a detailed transcriptional profile of the hypothalamus of 21-days old females, exposed to the control and undernutrition protocols during the lactation period . the profiles of gene expression in individual samples were determined by microarray analysis. out of  <dig>  well-annotated refseq transcripts   <dig>  individual sequences were detected. at a false discovery rate of 5 % ,  <dig> genes  were found to be differentially expressed .fig.  <dig> molecular changes in the hypothalami of 21-day old female f <dig> progeny undernourished  from birth to weaning at 21 days of age. a hierarchical clustering of transcriptional profiles, displayed as a heat map of normalized intensity values, from the hypothalamus of control  and lun mice. each line represent individual animal. b genes showing differential expression  classified into  <dig> top canonical pathways by ingenuity pathway analysis . the x-axis represents score for the likelihood ) that genes belonging to a specific functional category are affected in the specific comparisons. the significance cutoff is shown as an orange horizontal line. ratios  are shown as orange points within the bar. ratio values are shown on the right y axis



using ingenuity pathway knowledge base we identified major genetic pathways associated with synthesis of lipids, mass of adipose tissue, quantity of connective tissue, cell cycle progression, and synaptic depression . among top  <dig> biofunction categories those responsible for cellular function and maintenance , behavior , cell-to-cell signaling and interaction and nervous system development and function , lipid metabolism, molecular transport, and small molecule biochemistry  were identified . furthermore, genes differentially expressed in the hypothalamus of lun females were classified into several canonical pathways, including nnos signaling in neurons , axonal guidance signaling , and synaptic long term potentiation . in order to explain the observed hypothalamic gene expression changes evoked by undernutrition during early development we performed upstream regulator in silico search in ingenuity knowledge base using ingenuity pathway analysis . it allowed us to identify the cascade of potential upstream transcriptional regulators, which could explain the biological activities occurring in the hypothalami of undernourished females . among top upstream regulators of kiss <dig> expression transcription factor ap- <dig> alpha  and estrogen receptor  <dig>  were indicated. because upon hormone activation esr <dig> may form a homodimer or a heterodimer with esr <dig>  both estrogen receptors were presented as an integrated network . furthermore, both leptin  and its receptor  were among upstream regulators of kiss <dig> expression . on the other hand, among highly inhibited ligand-dependent nuclear receptors progesterone  and androgen  receptors were found. interestingly, pro-opiomelanocortin-alpha  and kallikrein  <dig> , showing opposite profiles of expression, were among genes regulated by ar. moreover, ccaat/enhancer binding protein , beta  and gli family zinc finger  <dig>  were among top upstream transcriptional regulators of molecular programming of hypothalamus.table  <dig> significantly activated ipa biofunctions identified for deg in hypothalamus of con vs lun 21-day old female progeny

validation of microarray results using qrt-pcr method confirmed that the expression of hypocretin , oxytocin , thyrotropin releasing hormone, pomc, and esr <dig> was decreased in the hypothalamus from 21-day old lun females . on the other hand, expression levels of cholecystokinin , calcitonin/calcitonin-related polypeptide, alpha , gamma-aminobutyric acid  a receptor, subunit delta , protein kinase c, delta , solute carrier family  <dig> , member  <dig> , and klk <dig> were maintained at higher levels in lun females . expression profile of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, regulatory subunit, polypeptide  <dig>  did not overlap between these two methods. in addition, expression of tested genes in the hypothalamus of males exposed to undernutrition during lactation was validated by qrt-pcr  and showed similar profiles as for females.fig.  <dig> relative expression of genes participating in molecular changes occurring in the hypothalami of 21-day old female  and male  f <dig> progeny. gene expression analyses were performed using qrt-pcr. expression levels are presented relative to ppib expression ). asterisks indicate difference between means . con – f <dig> control progeny, lun – f <dig> progeny undernourished during lactation



maternal diet during lactation affects body composition of 2nd generation offspring
to investigate the multigenerational impact of malnutrition during early development in the next experiment we evaluated changes in body composition, puberty attainment and patterns of gene expression in the hypothalami of f <dig> progeny generated from f <dig> control  and undernourished  mice. in our mouse model, f <dig> mice were bred according to their nutritional protocol to generate f <dig> progeny originating from control , mixed , and undernourished  parents. at first breeding, f <dig> lun females  and males  showed lighter body weight compared with con mice  and this change in body weights persisted in pregnant females, as measured on day  <dig> of pregnancy . consequently, we observed that undernutrition of either one or both parents during lactation was associated with changed growth rates of female and male pups. as early as day  <dig>  females  and males  generated from both undernourished parents  exhibited a lighter body weight compared with cxl mice and this change in body weight persisted at weaning . interestingly, at weaning, body weight of cxl mice was significantly different also from cxc and lxc animals . differences between body weight of f <dig> progeny generated from control  and undernourished  parents was only indicated in females at weaning .fig.  <dig> undernutrition  in f <dig> generation affects body composition and puberty attainment in f <dig> offspring. body weight and adiposity index  in female  and male  progeny. data are expressed as mean ± sem. means with different superscripts differ significantly within the same day of age. asterisks indicate difference between days in each breeding protocol . all comparisons of body weights between days in each breeding protocol  were significant . timing of vaginal opening , vaginal estrus  and balano preputial separation  in f <dig> progeny, generated in different breeding protocol. means  with different superscripts differ significantly . c – con , l – lun 



significant differences in adiposity index between f <dig> mice generated by different dietary protocols were only seen at 10 days of age . both cxl females and cxl males showed increased adiposity when compared to lxc and lxl mice . reduction of adiposity between  <dig> and 21 days of age was observed only for cxc  and cxl  females . all males, except for lxl, showed significant reduction of adiposity between  <dig> and 21 days of age .

maternal diet during lactation delays puberty attainment of 2nd generation offspring
similar to the initial experiments on f <dig> progeny, f <dig> progeny was tested for onset puberty using the same parameters. the most striking observation was that both female and male f <dig> progeny showed delayed puberty when only mother  or both parents  were undernourished during lactation . whereas vo occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in cxc, cxl and lxc mice, respectively, it was observed at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in lxl females . the mean age of ve was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in cxc and cxl mice, respectively, compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days in lxc and lxl mice, respectively . interestingly, no significant difference in body weights at vo  were observed, but it was significantly increased in lxc females at ve . correlations between body weight and age at vo was significant in cxl, lxc and cxc females . although the correlation between body weight and age at ve was significant in cxc females , it was non-significant in cxl, lxc and cxc females .

the onset of puberty in male f <dig> progeny was earlier in cxc and cxl males . whereas bps occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in cxc and cxl mice, respectively, it was observed later at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days of age in lxc and lxl males . interestingly, significant increase in body weight at bps was observed in lxl males . furthermore, a weak or no correlation between body weight and age at bps was detected in male f <dig> progeny generated in each breeding protocol .

maternal diet during lactation change hypothalamic gene expression networks of 2nd generations
since mice undernurtured before weaning by reduced food availability give birth to progeny showing signs of delayed puberty, we hypothesized that the expression of genes in the hypothalamus of progeny from undernourished parents will also be affected. to test this hypothesis we performed qrt-pcr on the hypothalamus of 21-day old f <dig> progeny. kisspeptin-signaling related genes expression within the hypothalamus of 21-day old mice is presented in figs. 8a and 9a and additional file 3: table s <dig>  one-way anova showed sex specific patterns of expression of leprv <dig>  kiss1r, and gnrh. although kiss <dig> mrna levels were downregulated in lxc and lxl f <dig> progeny irrespective of sex , leprv <dig> expression was upregulated only in lxc and lxl f <dig> males . on the other hand, kiss1r and gnrh mrna was decreased only in lxc and lxl f <dig> females . noteworthy, kisspeptin-signaling related genes showed altered gene expression in sexually mature f <dig> females . levels of leprv <dig>  kiss <dig>  and gnrh mrna were maintained high in hypothalami collected from lxl f <dig> females at diestrus .fig.  <dig> molecular changes in the hypothalami of 21-day old female f <dig> progeny. a expression pattern of kisspeptin-signaling related genes. genes showing increased b and decreased c expression in hypothalami of f <dig> undernourished neonates were tested in f <dig> females. expression levels are presented relative to ppib expression ). means  with different superscripts differ significantly ). c – con , l – lun

amongst genes upregulated in the hypothalamus of f <dig> undernourished progeny only cck and gabrd showed increased expression either in both or only one out of lxc and lxl f <dig> progeny . levels of cck were significantly higher in both lxc and lxl males  and only lxc females . upregulated expression of gabrd was observed in both lxl females and males . interestingly, the lowest expression of slc17a <dig> was observed in cxl mice regardless of sex . despite a similar pattern of calca and prkcd expression in hypothalami of cxl, lxc and lxl males  it was maintained constant  or slightly regulated in f <dig> females . our data showed no differences in klk <dig> levels between breeding protocols irrespective of breeding protocol.

in addition, genes showing decreased expression in hypothalami of undernourished f <dig> progeny were tested in f <dig> animals . noteworthy, sex specific patterns of hcrt expression was observed in f <dig> progeny, with decreased levels in cxl and lxl females  and increased in cxl, lxc, and lxl males . while oxt and pomc mrna expression was maintained low in lxl females  it was upregulated in lxl males . similarly, increased expression of trh was maintained in lxl f <dig> progeny regardless of sex . esr <dig> expression was maintained constant irrespective of breeding protocol.

discussion
undernutrition of lactating mothers perturbs morphological and molecular postnatal development of their progeny. here, we show that this nutritional perturbation of development extends to the expression of genes responsible for hypothalamic neural circuits controlling reproductive function in offspring of the first  and the following  generation. dysregulation of kisspeptin- related gene expression in the hypothalamus can be, in part, responsible for delayed puberty attainment in f <dig> and f <dig> male and female progeny. moreover, the analysis of the hypothalamic transcriptome has led to the identification of genetic pathways and functions associated with behavior , neural networking  and endocrine function . upstream regulators analysis revealed that leptin and ligand-depended nuclear receptors, such as androgen and estrogen receptors, can be involved in programming the onset of puberty. hence, our data strongly suggest that undernutrition during critical stages of development leads to a sex-specific molecular programming of the hypothalamus that is subsequently transmitted to male and female progeny in subsequent generations.

our morphometric data, registered up to approximately 6– <dig> weeks after the experimental period of undernutrition during suckling, indicate that the undernourished female and male progeny have not recovered and that their weight is significantly less than those of the controls. adiposity, measured at  <dig> and 21 days of age was also much lower in lun than in con mice, is in agreement with our previous studies  <cit> . engelbregt and co-workers  <cit>  showed that postnatal food restriction, achieved by litter enlargement, led to a significantly lower percentage of fat in female and male progeny at puberty. maternal undernutrition during pregnancy also affects body composition, as lean and fat masses were significantly reduced in f <dig> mice exposed to low protein diet in utero  <cit>  and absolute amounts of fat were decreased in intrauterine growth restricted females  <cit> . interestingly, in our present study body weights and composition of second generation mice, never exposed directly to postnatal undernutrition, were also significantly reduced. this data indicates that presence of a negative energy balance not only affected body composition of the f <dig> generation, but also that of the phenotype of f <dig> male and female progeny in sexually dimorphic manner. although, adiposity was only increased in 10-day old cxl male and female offspring, at weaning body weights were increased for cxl male and female offspring and decreased for lxl females.

other investigators have previously shown that nutritional stress during early stages of development , including low-protein or energy diet, and high-fat feeding, can affect the onset of puberty and reproductive capacity . frisch and revelle  <cit>  already in the early  <dig> proposed the critical weight/fat mass hypothesis suggesting that a weight of 48 kg or 22 % body fat allows puberty to start. indeed, the timing of the onset of puberty appears to be closely associated with body weight and adiposity in many species. for instance, sufficient levels of fat are essential for initiating puberty in rodents and humans  <cit> . on the other hand, obesity was shown to perturb various aspects of pubertal development  <cit>  although both f <dig> males and females had comparable body weights at puberty, irrespective of nutritional protocol, only females showed a strong correlation between the timing of sexual maturation, i.e. the age at vaginal estrus and body weight. this was not observed in lun counterparts, which have altered body composition and changed hypothalamic gene expression controlling neural circuits. although we did not measure adiposity at puberty, it needs to be stressed that our previous studies showed that lun mice not only maintain lower body weights till adulthood but also reduced fat and lean mass, as well as leptin levels  <cit> . interestingly, similar loss of correlation between age at vaginal estrus and body weight was indicted for cxl, lxc and lxl f <dig> females. moreover, parental nutritional history seems more likely to be involved in puberty onset programming in f <dig> generation, since progeny of either both lun parents or only the lun mother showed delayed puberty. thus, our results support a model in which malnutrition experienced during early postnatal development programs the recapitulation of the phenotype in the second generation, having consequences on the age of onset and rate of progression through puberty.

although the timing of puberty is influenced by several factors including nutrition and adiposity  <cit>  as well as size at birth  <cit> , it also has a strong and obligatory endocrine component. puberty is triggered by reactivation of the hpg axis which stimulates the release of lh and fsh from the pituitary gland, which in turn induces gonadal maturation  <cit> . the hypothalamic kisspeptin system has been suggested to play a major role in pubertal activation  <cit>  and kisspeptin neural circuits develop gradually during the first weeks of postnatal life in mice  <cit> . we found that the induction of genes involved in kisspeptin-signaling, i.e. leprv <dig>  stat <dig>  and gnrh <dig> occurs between  <dig> and 21 days of age and sex specific patterns are characteristic for leprv <dig> and stat <dig>  moreover, expression of kiss <dig> in f <dig> progeny of both sexes showed significant reduction in response to undernourishment during the lactation period, while kiss1r was slightly increased only in 21-day old f <dig> females. a similar response to fasting was showed in adult animals, in which decreased hypothalamic kiss <dig> expression was accompanied by lower circulating levels of lh  <cit> . nevertheless, increased expression of kiss1r may suggest a kind of compensation mechanism occurring at this time point only in females, leading to upregulation of kissr expression. interestingly, downregulation of kiss <dig> but upregulation of kiss1r mrna was observed in fasted prepubertal male and female rats  <cit> . the hypothalamus is structurally and functionally sexually dimorphic  <cit> . sexual differentiation of the hypothalamus is strongly influenced by differential exposure of male and female brains to sex steroid hormones in early life  <cit> . interestingly, gnrh neurons do not express most sex steroid hormone receptors  <cit> , thus neural circuits are developed via afferent inputs to gnrh neurons and include the action of kisspeptin. expression of kiss <dig> in the arcuate nucleus  showed apparent sex differences both at birth and during early postnatal life in rodents  <cit> . this perinatal sex difference in arc kiss <dig> parallels the sex difference in serum gonadotropins at this time, with females having higher fsh and lh than males  <cit> . importantly, the effect of neonatal undernutrition on kisspeptin-signaling related genes within the hypothalami, evident in both sexes, persisted over the generations, with similarly reduced kiss <dig> expression in lxc and lxl f <dig> progeny of both sexes. sex differences, however, were seen for leprv <dig> , kiss1r and gnrh <dig> . it is interesting to note that f <dig> generation females showed transcriptomic changes at reproductive maturity, but only those generated from both undernourished parents  showed increased expression of leprv <dig>  kiss <dig>  and gnrh <dig> at diestrus.

the comparative microarray analysis of hypothalamus of 21-day old f <dig> females revealed more profound transcriptomic changes influencing development of hypothalamus evoked by lactation undernutrition during suckling. we found that several genes involved in nervous system development and function, e.g. hcrt  <cit> , oxt  <cit> , esr <dig>  <cit> , pomc  <cit> , trh  <cit> , cck  <cit> , calca  <cit> , gabrd  <cit> , and slc17a <dig>  <cit>  have similar patterns of expression in lun f <dig> males and females. among them oxt, esr <dig>  and gabrd have known roles in reproductive system development and function, proved by our ingenuity knowledge base search. as mentioned above, careful attention needs to be paid to the steroids and their role in development of neuronal circuity, i.e. negative and positive feedbacks, leading to puberty attainment and influencing subsequent reproductive performance. although in anteroventral periventricular nucleus and neighboring rostral periventricular nucleus  kiss expressing cells also moderately co-express esr <dig>  at least in females, esr <dig> is believed to be the primary estrogen receptor for upregulating kiss <dig> expression, since estradiol  treatment does not stimulate avpv/pen kiss <dig> expression in esr <dig> ko mice, but still does it in esr <dig> ko mice  <cit> . in contrast, kisspeptin neurons in the arc are negatively regulated by e <dig> in both male and female rodents  <cit> . moreover, testosterone can also regulate kiss <dig> expression in the arc  <cit>  via ar, which was detected in over 60 % of kiss <dig> expressing cells in the arc of male mice  <cit> . both ligand-depended nuclear receptors, esrs and ar, were also identified among the upstream transcriptional regulators of molecular programming of hypothalamus in our study. recently it was suggested that pre-weaning levels of circulating e <dig> are required to keep the reproductive axis at bay until central inhibitory mechanisms are fully developed, or until the development of hypothalamic circuitry capable of reacting to e <dig> with both negative and positive feedback responses  <cit> . moreover, avpv/pen and arc kisspeptin neurons receive gabaergic synaptic input  <cit>  and gabaergic transmission to arc kisspeptin neurons is modulated by e <dig> in female mice  <cit> . our observations are thus the first to suggest possible interactions of esr <dig>  kisspeptin-signaling genes , and gabaergic transmission to hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons in hypothalamic gene networks, impaired by malnutrition during critical stages of development of f <dig> offspring. in contrast to f <dig> males and females, f <dig> offspring showed sex and parental nutritional history dependent profiles of mrna expression at 21 days of age. regardless of sex, similar patterns of expression were seen for thr, gabrd, and esr <dig>  however, esr <dig> was maintained constant in all tested breeding protocols, suggesting different mechanisms associated with programming of hypothalamic neural circuity in f <dig> offspring.

among factors regulating onset of puberty leptin is thought to be a permissive neuro-regulatory factor determining onset of puberty in several mammalian species  <cit> . it synchronizes growth, reproductive maturity and fertility with periods of food availability  <cit> ; post-weaning treatment with leptin accelerates puberty in rodents  <cit> , and leptin in the rat neonate affects hypothalamic maturation  <cit> . nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated that leptin transfers information about metabolic status to kisspeptin neurons indirectly because leptin administration fails to phosphorylate stat <dig>  a key component of a major intracellular signaling pathway mediating leptin action  <cit> . indeed, leptin receptors are located on many neuronal populations in the hypothalamus  <cit>  which can cross-talk with kisspeptin neurons  <cit> . the power of the mouse model for studies of nutritional programming is that development of white adipose tissue occurs exclusively during the postnatal period, and levels of plasma leptin are almost completely determined by leptin secreted by the inguinal fat  <cit> . while it is well known that maternal undernutrition or protein deficiency leads to underweight pups at birth and a shift in the leptin surge, we previously showed severely suppressed levels of plasma leptin in pups and adults exposed to undernutrition during the postnatal period  <cit> . since in the present study neonatal growth trajectories, including body composition, in f <dig> progeny under-nourished during lactation began to deviate from those of control pups at the time that coincides with neonatal surge in circulating leptin, this hormone may be a central driver in initiating hypothalamic neural circuity development in newborn pups. previous results showed that postnatal food restriction, achieved by litter enlargement, leads to altered leptin regulation and hypoleptinemia at puberty  <cit> . since attenuation in the development of the neuronal feeding circuitry in the hypothalamus has been proposed to be the basis for the hyperphagic and reproductive phenotypes of leptin deficient ob/ob mice  <cit> , the severe suppression of circulating leptin  in lun mice at 10 days of age is expected to have profound impacts on the development of regulatory neuronal circuits regulated by leptin, including the reproductive axis. leptin involvement in hypothalamic gene networks was also proved in our in silico analysis where it was identified as the powerful upstream transcriptional regulators of molecular programming of hypothalamus in f <dig> female progeny, leading to altered expression of several genes, including pomc, kiss <dig>  cck, cart prepropeptide , hcrt, trh, and esr <dig>  it was striking that some of these genes were also affected in f <dig> female and male progeny never exposed directly to undernutrition and the accompanying leptin deficiency. similar downregulation of kiss <dig> hypothalamic expression was detected in f <dig> offspring generated from either lactation undernourished f <dig> female and control f <dig> male  or both undernourished f <dig> parents . other molecular changes occurring in the f <dig> hypothalamus appeared to be sexually dimorphic and dependent on paternal nutritional history, as opposite expression of oxt, pomc and hcrt was observed in lxl f <dig> females and males, but only when compared to cxc f <dig> counterparts.

besides kiss <dig> neurons, other hypothalamic populations may also provide afferent signals on the hpg axis to regulate reproduction. importantly, arc pomc neurons comprise a critical metabolic-sensing pathway controlling the reproductive neuroendocrine axis  <cit> . pomc neurons are well positioned to be a direct target of leptin and insulin, as they express leprs  <cit>  and insulin receptors   <cit> . consequently, pomc neurons as a target of leptin/insulin actions were shown to be important for fertility, as ir/lepr-pomc ko mice exhibit lengthened reproductive cycles, follicular arrest, hyper-androgenemia, and infertility  <cit> . importantly, kiss <dig> expressing cells were shown to communicate with neuropeptide-y  and pomc cells, suggesting that these three cell types coordinate brain control of reproduction and metabolic homeostasis  <cit> . in addition, leptin was shown to inhibit hcrt neurons both directly and indirectly by several gaba-dependent as well as -independent mechanisms  <cit> . thus, characteristic hypothalamic expression patterns of kiss <dig>  gabrd, pomc, and hcrt in f <dig> undernourished offspring, determined by parental nutritional history and sex specificity in the following f <dig> generation clearly support the concept that reciprocal connections exist between these factors that are responsible for the developmental programming of hypothalamic circuitry controlling reproductive function in a multigenerational manner.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the first weeks of postnatal life when neurons send their axonal projections to their target sites are recognized as the second important developmental period for hypothalamic development in rodents  <cit> . we showed that this early developmental plasticity of hypothalamus leads to transcriptomic changes in hypothalamus when challenged with undernutrition and in consequence change body composition and timing of puberty in f <dig> generation. this work also demonstrates that malnutrition during critical stages of development leads to sex-specific molecular programming of hypothalamus that is subsequently transmitted to both male and female f <dig> progeny, defining their phenotype dependent on parental nutrition history. it seems likely that epigenetic mechanism is involved in molecular programming of hpg axis, since histone deacetylases  were among potent upstream regulators of the molecular changes occurring in f <dig> females. other studies showing: 1) protective effect of leptin against the later obesity via changes in promoter methylation of some genes, including the hypothalamic pomc  <cit>  and 2) histone deacetylation and dna methylation of kiss <dig> in avpv/pen contributing to sex-specific differences in the neuronal cell number  <cit>  give a rationale for further testing of our hypothesis. these observations open up new roads for the investigation of mechanisms involved in multigenerational molecular programming of the in hypothalamic neural circuits controlling reproductive function in both sexes, including deep investigation of molecular changes in specific hypothalamic nuclei  having important roles in the control of reproductive function and containing distinct populations of kisspeptin neurons.
