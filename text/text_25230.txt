BACKGROUND
the precise regulation of proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation of neural stem cells  and neural progenitors is crucial for proper formation of the mammalian brain during embryonic, postnatal and adult stages . in the adult mouse brain, nscs persist throughout life in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus  and the subventricular zone  of the lateral ventricle. in these regions, nscs generate mature neurons through a complex sequence of developmental steps including the division of a precursor cell and a multi-step process  that ends with the formation of a postmitotic functionally integrated new neuron  <cit> . these developmental stages can be distinguished on the basis of the expression of stage-specific marker proteins including the microtubule binding protein doublecortin . in the adult mouse brain, dcx is almost exclusively expressed by immature newborn neurons in the dg and the svz/olfactory bulb-system and is commonly used to distinguish immature neurons from non-neuronally committed precursors and to estimate neurogenic activity . perturbation of adult neurogenesis is associated with learning memory deficits, dysregulation of mood, and has been implied in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders  <cit> . hence, revealing the regulation of genetic programs crucial for nscs expansion and lineage commitment in the adult brain can provide the molecular basis for developing effective methods for nsc-based and adult neurogenesis-targeted therapies.

rna interference  mechanisms are a well-conserved phenomenon in eukaryotes and act at multiple levels to regulate gene expression . a large number of small rna classes have been identified, including micrornas , small interfering rnas  and piwi-interacting rnas . these classes differ in their biogenesis, their modes of target regulation and in the biological pathways they regulate . in mammals small rna silencing pathways depend on two groups of genes encoding the key proteins of the dicer and argonaute families  <cit> .

the rnase iii enzyme dicer is required for the processing of short  micro-rnas  and small interfering rnas  from double stranded rna precursors. dicer-generated rnas trigger the degradation of complementary mrnas or prevent their translation . in addition accumulating evidence indicates that rnai components and small rnas participate in nuclear processes such as transposon regulation, heterochromatin formation, genome stability and transcription . defining the role of dicer generated small rnas in mammalian development is complicated by embryonic lethality of constitutive dicer knockouts in mice  <cit> . mouse embryonic stem cells in the absence of dicer fail to differentiate in vitro and do not contribute to mouse development in vivo  <cit> . this highlights the importance of sirnas and mirnas in the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation.

here we show that the rnai machinery regulates dcx levels and is associated with chromatin in differentiating adult neural progenitors. deletion of dicer causes abnormal higher levels of dcx expression and mirna- <dig> over-expression can down-regulate dcx levels in differentiating adult neural progenitors. in addition a chromatin-binding assay reveals that some of dicer and argonaute- <dig> associate to chromatin in differentiating adult neural progenitors. we conclude that the dicer/argonaute- <dig> rnai pathway plays an important role, potentially even through chromatin association, in regulating gene expression programs in the neural stem cell lineage.

RESULTS
adult neural stem cells lacking dicer have higher level of doublecortin
to study rnai machinery function in mouse adult neural stem cells we isolated neural progenitor cells  from the svz of 8 weeks old dicer cko  mice  <cit> . the deletion of the loxp-flanked exons 20– <dig> in the dicer locus was induced by transducing npcs with the htn-cre protein, a recombinant fusion protein able to cross the cell and nuclear membrane  <cit> . consistent with the almost complete deletion of the dicer locus  the htn-cre treated cells showed a marked decrease in the levels of mature mirnas , of dicer transcript , and of dicer protein  indicating that activity of the rnai machinery was severely impaired. along with the dicer transcript we analyzed the levels of additional transcripts , namely actin as a housekeeping gene, lin <dig> as mirna-dependent gene  <cit> , dcx and sox <dig> as possible mirna targets based on the mirna target prediction algorithm targetscan  <cit> . the actin transcript levels were almost unchanged; lin <dig> and sox <dig> transcripts were slightly up-regulated, but strikingly dcx showed a  <dig>   fold increase in dicer null cells compared to control cells. then we asked if the increase of the dcx transcript in dicer null cells resulted also in an increase of the dcx protein level. in control npcs, the dcx protein was detectable only in differentiating cells  but, consistent with the qpcr data, the dicer −/− npcs had already detectable dcx protein. most of the dicer −/− npcs die upon induction of differentiation and therefore this condition was not included in the further analysis.fig.  <dig> dcx is up-regulated upon dicer deletion in adult neural stem cells. a–c the samples analyzed were adult neural progenitor cells  dicer flox/flox  or dicer −/−. dicer deletion was obtained by transducing dicer f/f cells with htn-cre protein. a taqman quantitative rt-pcr of mir125b and let7-c mature mirna transcripts. transcript levels were normalized against the housekeeping gene snorna <dig> and calculated respect to dicer f/f  that is set to  <dig>  n =  <dig>  bars represent the mean ± standard error of the mean. b quantitative rt-pcr of the indicated transcripts. transcript levels were normalized against the housekeeping gene srp <dig> and calculated respect to dicer f/f  that is set to  <dig>  the blue horizontal bar indicates the scale change in the y-axis. n =  <dig>  bars represent the mean ± standard error of the mean. c western blot showing a representative picture of the dicer, dcx and actin  protein levels in npcs  or differentiating npcs  of the indicated genotype. most of the dicer −/− cells die upon induction of differentiation and therefore are not included in the analysis. three independent biological samples have been analyzed. shown are representative pictures



overall our results show that in npcs the ablation of dicer and the consequent impairment of the rnai machinery result in the up-regulation of the dcx transcript and protein.

doublecortin is upregulated upon dicer deletion in hippocampal newborn neurons
in order to understand if the rnai machinery impairment can deregulate dcx expression also in the in vivo context we induced dicer deletion in the adult hippocampal neurogenic lineage by injecting adult  dicer cko  mice with a recombinant mouse moloney leukemia-retrovirus bicistronically encoding for gfp and cre-recombinase into the septal hippocampal dentate gyrus. heterozygous dicer cko  mice injected with the same retroviral preparation served as controls. animals were sacrificed at 28 days post injection . brain sections were immunostained for the immature neuronal marker dcx and for gfp, to identify virus-transduced cells . consistent with previous studies most of virus-transduced cells in heterozygous dicer cko readily down regulated dcx at  <dig> dpi  <cit> . interestingly, we found a significant increase  of dcx/gfp double-positive cells in the dicer cko. we also checked another immature neuronal marker, sox <dig>  but did not observe significant differences of sox11/gfp double positive cells in the dicer cko respect to the control . the lack of significant change in sox <dig> expression is in line with our in vitro analysis  where dicer −/− npcs show minor increase in sox <dig> expression. additionally we observed a consistent reduction  of virally transduced gfp positve cells in the dicer cko . although in the present experimental set up we cannot fully exclude differences in the virus transduction efficiency between different experimental groups this would be suggestive of reduced viability of dicer deficient neurons. taken together these data indicate that in newborn neurons dcx levels are sensitive to the levels of dicer and thus to the functionality of the rnai machinery.fig.  <dig> dcx is up-regulated upon dicer deletion in hippocampal new born neurons. a, b representative pictures of the immunostaining for dcx and gfp on hippocampal regions of dicer cko mice transduced with cre-recombinase. a

overexpression of mirna- <dig> reduces doublecortin levels in differentiating adult neural stem cells
our in vitro and in vivo  experiments show that the impairment of the rnai machinery through the deletion of dicer in npcs is paralleled by abnormally elevated levels of dcx. the dcx transcript has been shown to be regulated by the rnai machinery through mirna-dependent pathways that are severely reduced upon dicer deletion . specifically, mir- <dig>  <cit>  was shown to regulate dcx in mouse embryonic brain tissues, while mir- <dig>  <cit>  was found to modulate dcx levels in a human neuroblastoma cell line. of these, we found only mir- <dig> to be expressed in adult mouse npcs  in agreement with a previous report  <cit>  showing the presence of mir- <dig> but not mir- <dig> in the neurogenic areas of the mouse adult brain. we next asked whether mir- <dig> could target and regulate dcx levels in adult npcs. to this purpose we created a mir128-rfp expression vector . to check its functionality we transfected this vector into neuro2a cells, which resulted in a marked increase in mir- <dig> levels  along with decreased levels of dcx protein but not the transcript . this indicates that the vector is able to increase the mir- <dig> levels leading to dcx down-regulation by translational repression as it has been described for many mirnas  <cit> . we then transfected the mir-128-rfp or mir-ctr-rfp  in adult npcs  and let them differentiate for 6 days. after fixation the cells were immunostained for dcx, gfap  and rfp marking the transfected cells . interestingly, we found a significant decrease in the fraction of dcx positive cells among the transfected cells when mir- <dig> is overexpressed . notably, the fraction of gfap positive cells among the transfected ones was not significantly affected. our results show that mir- <dig> overexpression reduces the levels of dcx in differentiating npcs indicating that mir- <dig> can target and potentially take part in the regulation of dcx levels in adult neurogenesis.fig.  <dig> overexpression of mirna <dig> reduces dcx protein levels in n2a cells. a–c the samples analyzed were mock-treated neuro2a cells  or neuro2a cells treated with mirna-128-rfp expressing plasmid. a taqman quantitative rt-pcr of the mature mirna- <dig> transcripts normalized against the housekeeping small non-coding rna snorna <dig>  transcript levels are indicated as fold change respect to the control  that is set to  <dig>  n =  <dig>  bars represent the mean ± standard error of the mean. b western blot showing the dcx and gapdh  protein levels in mock and mirna- <dig> over-expressing cells. c quantitative rt-pcr of the indicated transcripts. transcript levels are indicated as fold change respect to the control  that is set to  <dig>  transcripts were normalized against the housekeeping gene srp <dig>  n =  <dig>  bars represent the mean ± standard error of the mean. two-tailed t test was applied for statistical analysis. ns not significant; p =  <dig>

rnai components are associated with chromatin in differentiating adult neural stem cells
the rnai machinery regulates gene expression mainly in the cytoplasm but has been reported to act also in the nucleus  <cit> . in order to assess if the main rnai components could operate in the nucleus of npcs we used a chromatin binding assay  <cit>  on undifferentiated and differentiating npcs. this assay has been already used by us and others to predict the chromatin association of rnai components  <cit> . chromatin associated proteins will be found in tritonx- <dig> resistant  and, subsequently, in dnase and high salt  extracted fractions . indeed, a substantial portion of rna polymerase ii  is detected in these fractions . in contrast, most of dicer and argonaute- <dig>  are found in the tritonx- <dig> soluble fraction , along with β-catenin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , a marker for proteins not associated with chromatin . in differentiating npcs  the markers pol ii and gapdh are found in the same fraction as in undifferentiated cells. in contrast to undifferentiated npcs, β-catenin was detected also in the chromatin fractions  consistent with the activation of the wnt pathway during npcs differentiation . interestingly, also dicer and ago <dig> display a differential fractionation profile depending on the differentiation status of the npcs; thus dicer and ago <dig> were also found in the chromatin fraction p <dig> in differentiating npcs. in contrast to pol ii and β-catenin, dicer and ago <dig> are found almost exclusively in the p <dig> but barely in the s <dig> chromatin fraction indicating that tritonx- <dig> is sufficient to fully release these proteins most likely due to a looser chromatin association of dicer and ago <dig> compared to pol ii and β-catenin.fig.  <dig> rnai components are associated with chromatin in differentiating adult neural stem cells. a scheme of the procedure followed to fractionate neural progenitor cells. insoluble fractions  were dissolved in ripa buffer . chromatin associated proteins should be found in fractions p <dig> and s <dig>  b, c equivalent amounts of the resulting protein samples from undifferentiated or differentiating  adult neural progenitor cells were analyzed by western blot for the presence of the indicated proteins. gapdh  serves as a chromatin unbound marker; pol ii  is a chromatin bound marker. β-cat β-catenin, ago <dig> argonaute- <dig>  three independent biological samples have been analyzed. shown are representative pictures




thus, the dicer/ago <dig> complex displays differential association with chromatin of adult npcs depending on their differentiation status, raising the possibility that nuclear rnai may contribute to the control of gene expression during specific developmental stages of adult neurogenesis.

discussion
the rnai machinery has emerged as an important regulator of neuronal differentiation but to date its contribution in adult neurogenesis is still not fully understood. we further probed the function of the rnai machinery by loss-of-function, gain-of-function and biochemical approaches.

we show that in adult npcs the ablation of dicer results in a massive up-regulation of the dcx transcript and protein . this suggests that dcx levels are heavily influenced directly or indirectly by rnai activity. in favor of a direct regulation, dcx mrna has been shown to be targeted by different mirnas  <cit> , which—in absence of dicer—would not be matured and consequently would not be able to target dcx mrna for degradation or translational inhibition. in line with this view we show that overexpression of the mir- <dig> in differentiating adult npcs causes the reduction of the dcx levels . however mir- <dig> and dcx are not mutually exclusive in our in vitro cultured npcs. indeed mir- <dig> maintains similar level of expression also in differentiating npcs  when dcx is physiologically expressed . like many mirnas, mir- <dig> has been show to have relatively modest effects on its targets  <cit> . thus, in differentiating npcs, mir- <dig> is likely responsible to fine-tune rather than switching off dcx, by repressing but without eliminating it. notably the mirna algorithm targetscan  identifies, in addition to mir- <dig>  let- <dig> and mir- <dig> as potential regulators of dcx. both these mirna are, similarly to mir- <dig>  expressed in the neurogenic areas of the adult mouse brain  <cit>  making them possible additional regulators of dcx expression.

argonaute directly binds the mature mirna processed by dicer and seeks target mrnas that have complementarity to the mirna. if complementarity exists in the central region of the mirna  then the mrna target can be cleaved via the endonuclease activity of ago <dig>  differently argonaute is recruited to a complex containing gw <dig> within cytoplasmic p bodies where translational repression occurs  <cit> . notably mir <dig> lacks this complementarity  in dcx target sites predicted by the mirna algorithms targetscan and microrna.org  <cit>  . in agreement with this prediction we found only the dcx protein but not the transcript being down regulated upon mir <dig> overexpression . therefore the massive up-regulation of the dcx transcript observed in npcs upon dicer deletion  is hardly explained only by a decrease of mirnas targeting dcx but it likely involves additional layers of rnai-dependent regulation.

mirnas have been implied in the modulation of differentiation and proliferation of adult npcs . we kept adult dicer-null npcs in culture for weeks without visible defects but we observed a massive cell death upon stimulation of differentiation by growth factor withdrawal , arguing that in particular differentiating npcs are highly dependent on dicer. in line with a particular importance of dicer for differentiating cells, previous studies  <cit>  showed that dicer is strictly required for embryonic npcs differentiation. the ability of dicer-null npcs to generate both neurons and glia was, however, restored by the reintroduction of dicer, demonstrating that these cells were not irreversibly transformed despite the absence of dicer and micrornas  <cit> . similarly, reintroduction of dicer was able to rescue the differentiation impairment of mouse embryonic stem cells dicer −/−  <cit> . the dependency of npcs differentiation on dicer may not only be related to dicer’s crucial function in mirna biogenesis. rna interference components including dicer have been implicated in nuclear related functions such as transposon regulation, heterochromatin formation, genome stability and transcription . notably, by using a chromatin binding assay we observed that some of the key rnai components, dicer and argonaute- <dig>  associate to chromatin in differentiating adult npcs . although a chip-seq experiment  will be required to reveal the dicer and ago- <dig> binding sites on chromatin, this already suggests that the critical role of rnai in adult npcs differentiation might be also linked to its chromatin-association.

interestingly, transposable elements are expressed and active in the brain. line- <dig> elements, for example, are actively mobilized in normal mammalian brains during neurogenesis , leading to genetic heterogeneity, which might be of functional relevance. however, because transposable elements are capable of jumping into new positions in the genome they are potentially detrimental. transposable element activation has been correlated with several neurodegenerative diseases . interestingly it has been recently shown that mutations in the rnai key component argonaute- <dig> resulted in increased transposons expression in the drosophila brain leading to detrimental effects such as accelerate memory impairment and shortened life span  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that rnai components might have a similar function in the mammalian brain by acting as a barrier against excessive transposable element activity during neurogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
our data clearly show that rnai machinery takes part in regulating neuron-specific developmental programs, in which the key rnai components dicer and ago- <dig> display a dynamic chromatin association.
