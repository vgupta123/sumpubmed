BACKGROUND
it is difficult to perform genomewide genetic association studies  of human behavior. this is due to heterogeneity, biological complexity, ambiguous phenotype classifications and the challenges of phenotyping large numbers of individuals. as a result, very little is known about human behavioral genetics. most of the progress has been driven by the availability of epidemiological data of medical relevance: smoking behavior  <cit> , coffee consumption behavior  <cit> , alcohol drinking behavior  <cit> , and mental disability  <cit>  or illness  <cit> . in contrast, there has been limited exploration of common complex-behaviors such as aggression  <cit> , happiness  <cit>  or social phobia  <cit> .

largely due to heterogeneity, most complex traits are difficult to map in humans. dozens to thousands of variants can each contribute minute amounts to heritable risk, and this can differ dramatically in different ethnicities and their subgroups. many major breakthroughs in human genetics have resulted from studying isolated populations and multigenerational families. the advantages of those latter approaches, and others, are dramatically exaggerated in dogs:  there are approximately  <dig> dog breeds, each on the order of 100-fold less genetically-complex than the full population. thus, compared to humans and their major ethnic groups, dogs are much more similar within breeds and much more different across breeds.  dogs are often part of a family or working environment and receive high levels of health care. lastly, iii) dogs have more phenotypic variation than any other land mammal; and much of that variation is the result of “evolutionary” selection under domestication. the strengths of dog models of complex genetics have been exploited mainly in the area of cancer  <cit> , but recently also in behavior. examples include investigation of obsessive compulsive disorders in select breeds  <cit>  and diverse behavioral traits in one breed .

strikingly, multiple groups recently showed that most genetic variation associated with diverse morphological traits in dogs can be mapped by cross-breed gwa using only breed stereotypes and about a dozen or more individuals each from dozens of diverse breeds . this revealed that a great extent of the genetic variation in domesticated dogs was already present prior to breed creation. a good example is the trait of body size, the majority of which is explained by six gene variants in all but very large breeds . those canine genes are relevant to known size-variation related genes across phyla  and others indicate opportunities for discovery . a landmark gwas from  <dig> reported many loci and five candidate genes associated with the following behavioral traits: herding, boldness, excitability, pointing, and trainability  <cit> . a more recent study that used the same stereotype data, and a cohort with different breeds  <cit> , did not replicate those findings for one overlapping trait, boldness . the chr <dig> region that was associated with boldness in the newer study, between the msrb <dig> and hmga <dig> genes, was the same as was strongly associated with two morphological traits – reduced ear erectness and small size. although each of the three traits appeared to be associated with a different haplotype, with one exception, all bold breeds were erect-eared and small, and vice versa for non-bold breeds. this region spans among the most highly-differentiated markers reported from single-marker fst analysis and, at 2 mb, it is the second largest of such regions. similarly, vaysse et al. showed that sociability  maps to the highest fst region in the genome , which was shown by others to be associated with skull shape and large size  <cit> . to our knowledge, there are no further claims to resolve the various genetic associations or to suggest biological relevance of those loci to boldness and sociability; they appear to be open questions.

here we report mapping fear and aggression traits associated with genetic variation shared across diverse breeds. these represent very common and important canine traits in the behavioral veterinary setting  <cit> , and in human public health  <cit> . it seems likely to us that our findings will also prove to be relevant to human anxiety disorders and aggression, violence and criminality. additionally, dog is the only animal that was originally domesticated by humans for almost-purely behavioral traits – and arguably is the only predator to be fully domesticated. fear, aggression and related traits like tameness have long been thought to be central to the domestication of dogs  <cit> , and this is supported by experimental domestication of silver foxes  <cit> . both wild wolves and foxes are typically more fearful and aggressive than their domesticated counterparts; however, some dog breeds have been actively selected for enhanced aggressiveness in certain contexts such as fighting, guarding or vermin control. our findings show that canine fear and aggression that are directed toward strange humans or other dogs share variation that was present prior to the creation of dog breeds. fine mapping of those two loci implicates genes that are strongly suggestive of having relevance to fear/aggression. one variant is protective and the other increases risk of fear and aggression. we discuss below how variation at these loci may have been selected-for during the process of domestication.

RESULTS
study design
the present study was designed to test whether breed stereotypes of fear and aggression could be mapped by cross-breed gwa. while this concept has been validated for morphological traits, it has not been for behavioral traits. success here requires two primary elements: biologically-relevant and robust phenotype data , and the sharing of behaviorally-associated genetic variation across diverse breeds . we used three unrelated breed-specific resources: one of behavioral phenotypes  <cit>  and two of breed-specific genotypes  <cit> . the phenotype dataset is derived from c-barq owner questionnaires  <cit> . in c-barq, fear and aggression comprise five and four subtypes, respectively. all but two of these c-barq phenotypes  were previously validated using a panel of  <dig> dogs with prior diagnoses of specific behavior problems  <cit> . more recently, other studies have also provided criterion validation by demonstrating associations between these phenotypes and particular training outcomes in working dogs  <cit> , and the performance of dogs in various standardized behavioral tests . there is currently no alternative phenotype resource that approximates the numbers of breeds and traits represented. the two genotype datasets used here are those used to map cross-breed stereotypes and study population genetics by vaysse and ratnakumar et al.  and boyko et al. . the behavioral and genotype datasets overlap for  <dig> breeds and  <dig> breeds for vaysse’s and boyko’s datasets respectively.

our study design included the following: i) principal components analysis  of breed phenotypes and genotypes ; ii) discovery study of gwa mapping of published c-barq behavioral data  with the vaysse genotypes; iii) confirmation study of the discovery results using c-barq and boyko datasets; iv) testing of the internal-consistency of the c-barq phenotypes and of the prediction-model performance in a second set of breeds for which phenotype data was not previously published; and v) fine mapping and biological relevance analysis of the two peak regions associated with canine fear and aggression directed to other dogs and human strangers.

discovery studies of genetic association with fear and aggression
assuming sufficient power, the greatest potential limitations of the present gwas’s are latent variables, such as cryptic relatedness and batch effects, and population structure. we mitigated these in several ways, beginning by using many breeds instead of few. we used two genotype datasets that represented different genotyping platforms and cohorts with partially overlapping breed contents as discovery and confirmation datasets. thus, each dataset has different batch effects, population structure and cryptic relatedness. lastly, we controlled for relatedness and population structure in the gwas’s by using a centered relatedness matrix correction .

before initiating mapping studies, we conducted principal components analysis  of the breed-specific c-barq data on fear and aggression . component scores of the breeds evaluated  showed no relevant deviations across the two genetic datasets. breeds evaluated in both datasets are distributed similarly in both plots. this preliminary evaluation suggests that, despite having different breed makeups in the two datasets, they show consistent results. using either genotype dataset the following traits are clustered together apart from the others: stranger-oriented fear, stranger-directed aggression and dog-directed aggression. this suggested to us that the three traits could be genetically-related. a second implication of the pca results is that owner-directed aggression is most distant, and therefore different, from the three clustered traits mentioned above. in other words, the pca indicated a testable hypothesis that the three clustered traits would share associated loci, but that owner-directed aggression was associated with other loci .fig.  <dig> pca analysis of behavioral traits. since the two gwa datasets only partially overlapped in breed content, pca analysis was performed to evaluate if the breed makeup affects the distribution structure of the variables. a, b component pattern and component scores, respectively, of c-barq behavioral traits on the matching breeds in the boyko dataset. c, d component pattern and component scores of c-barq behavioral traits on the matching breeds in the vaysse dataset



our initial discovery study tested for genomewide-significant association for fear and aggression traits from c-barq using the genotype dataset of vaysse et al.  <cit>  . this gwas involved  <dig>  snp markers genotyped in  <dig> individuals from  <dig> breeds. consistent with the pca results, stranger-oriented fear, and stranger and dog-directed aggression is predominantly associated with many markers at two loci – chr18: <dig> , <dig> and chrx: <dig> ,495- <dig> , <dig>  – whereas owner-directed aggression is distinct. rather, the latter is associated with previously described small-size variation in the igf <dig> gene on chr15:44 mb and with a single marker at chr34:29 mb . dog-oriented fear, which does not purely cluster with stranger-directed fear/aggression and dog-directed aggression , is also predominantly-associated with the chr <dig> and x loci. touch-sensitivity also has both of those loci, but a marker on chr10:11 mb  has the second strongest signal and chrx:105 mb is considerably weaker. these latter two findings are consistent with the pca pattern in fig. 1c, where touch-sensitivity and dog-oriented fear are closest to stranger-oriented fear and stranger- and dog-directed aggression. the other fear traits share one, but not both, of the chr <dig> and x loci: nonsocial fear is associated with chr <dig> and the same chr10:11 mb marker associated with touch-sensitivity; and separation-related anxiety is associated with chrx:105 mb and chr10:11 mb .fig.  <dig> manhattan plots of c-barq aggression traits. vertical lines indicate relevant and consistent hits across the two gwa datasets. in each panel, the top plot corresponds to the vaysse dataset while the bottom plot corresponds to boyko dataset. a stranger-directed aggression. b dog-directed aggression. c owner-directed aggression. d dog rivalry

confirmation of genetic association results in a second cohort
we repeated the discovery studies using the same behavioral data, but with the boyko genotype dataset  <cit>  . the data we used was genotypes of  <dig>  markers in  <dig> individuals from  <dig> breeds,  <dig> of which overlapped the vaysse data used above. because the same breeds were not used in the two studies, this is not strictly a replication study. however, because we are looking at cross-breed association, the findings in one can confirm those in the other. we also expect the paired gwas’s to mitigate false positive hits that are due to latent variables or population structure in the individual studies.table  <dig> summary of canine fear and aggression gwas results. fear and aggression trait peaks are given for separate gwas studies using vaysse  and boyko  genotype datasets. loci shared with both are black and others are gray. coordinates use canfam <dig> assembly

the results of the confirmation gwas’s generally confirmed associations of chr <dig> and x with stranger and dog-oriented fear and aggression. both loci are genomewide-significant in dog-oriented fear, but only chr <dig> is significant in stranger-oriented fear and aggression . dog-directed aggression has no significant hits, but has suggestive evidence for chr <dig> among the top ten markers. as in the vaysse gwa above, owner-directed aggression is most strongly associated with several markers that peak within the igf <dig> gene on chr15:44 mb. whereas the discovery gwas of dog rivalry has no hits, the confirmation gwas shows strong association with igf1; and, unlike in the discovery gwas, this locus is also significant in dog-oriented fear, separation-related anxiety, and touch-sensitivity. we interpret this as predominantly due to the breed make-up of the two cohorts. at the level of genomewide significance, the most similar results between the two studies are for dog-oriented fear , separation-related anxiety  and touch sensitivity .

prediction model and internal consistency of c-barq behavioral data
we next created a model to predict fear and aggression behavior in a third group of dog breeds not included above. in the additional file  <dig>  we provide a detailed description of the methods and results. the goal was to test the predictive potential of the loci identified in the discovery and replication phases of this study. we thus tested a model of the discovery loci applied to a set of dogs breeds not included in the discovery/replication cohorts mentioned above. briefly, we used the allele frequencies for the four main loci  to define a multiple linear regression by using a stepwise forward selection method . chr <dig> and chrx contributed significantly in the model for most traits whereas chr <dig> was only significant for owner directed aggression. we evaluated the performance of our predictive model and determined that it had a  <dig>  % success rate, which is significantly higher  than the  <dig>  % random chance of success . we observed that some breeds are harder to predict which suggests that breed specific variants are likely to exist.fig.  <dig> success/failure matrix of predicted values. green fill indicates a successful prediction and red is a failed prediction. columns correspond to aggression and fear traits while rows correspond to dog breeds predicted. totals are the sum of successful prediction within the column/row; columns and rows are sorted in numerical order and cells have a fill color gradient that goes from red  to green 



haplotype analysis and signatures of positive selection
the associated loci and alleles on chr <dig> , chr <dig>  and chr <dig>  are the same as those known to be associated with small size across dog breeds , including in the genotyped cohorts used here  <cit> . allele frequency  and haplotype analysis of the peak region on chr <dig> reveals a very low level of ld , indicating that the associated haplotype is very old. in contrast to chr <dig>  the associated region on chrx lies within a  <dig> – <dig>  mb block of strong ld . analysis of relevant breeds using whole genome sequence data  <cit>  and dna copy number variation  data  appears to rule out that the functional variants are protein coding changes or cnvs.fig.  <dig> haplotype distribution across dog breeds based on novel chr <dig> and x markers associated with aggression and fear. haplotypes were defined only on the alleles of the top markers detected in this study. allele distributions are color coded on a gradient that goes from yellow  to blue . allele label letters are arbitrary

the peak gwas hits on chr <dig> and x were further analyzed for signatures of positive selection. in addition to the fixation index , we refer to statistics of population differentiation  and reduced heterozygosity . genetic hitchhiking generally refers to neutral variation that is carried along with an allele under positive selection  <cit> . as the selected variant goes to fixation, there is a loss of variation flanking that site   <cit> . ld in such a selected region increases dramatically, and that effect is the basis of several approaches for identifying positive selection . we searched for evidence of hitchhiking by measuring haplotype sizes through direct phasing analysis .

in fig.  <dig> we present analysis of the new fear and aggression locus on chr <dig>  haplotype phasing analysis shows the two breeds with the increased risk allele  – dachshund and yorkshire terrier – have much larger haplotypes compared to the alternative allele . their haplotype sizes, and the central position of the putative variant under selection, suggest a recent selective sweep according to hitchhiking theory. notably, only a subset of the increased-fear/aggression haplotype under selection contains the fgf <dig> retrogene insertion that causes chondrodysplasia in some breeds but not in others. all known exceptions to the co-occurrence of the retrogene insertion and the phenotype are very small dogs – yorkshire terrier, chihuahua and japanese chin – leading those authors to propose the trait is not manifest in carriers that are small  <cit> . . moreover, although some breeds have the retrogene insertion within the ancestral increased-fear/aggression haplotype on chr <dig>  several breeds have >20 % allele frequency of that haplotype but lack the insertion and chondrodysplasia  <cit> . the following are those breeds that commonly carry the ancestral haplotype and are known to lack the retrogene insertion at a common frequency : beagle ; border collie , cocker spaniel , english setter  and jack russell terrier . although the numbers of dogs screened for two of those breeds are small, none of the breeds has been reported to have heritable chondrodysplasia – which is dominant for this chr <dig> variant. shar-peis and huskies, which are also common carriers of the ancestral haplotype, have not been screened for the retrogene insertion but have not been reported to have heritable chondrodysplasia.fig.  <dig> mapping phased-haplotypes and s

thus, there is evidence of recent selection for the chr <dig> increased-fear/aggression haplotype in dachshunds and yorkshire terriers ; that selection is presumed to be for short legs in the former but unknown for the latter. only the two breeds that carry the chr <dig> increased-fear/aggression allele at high frequency have di signal spanning the peak snp, and both also have the longest si signal either intersecting or close to the peak snp. the allele protective of fear and aggression has high allele frequencies in all but the two breeds that carry the risk allele, and is fixed  in  <dig> of the  <dig> breeds . in contrast, two sources of wolf sequence data from around the world show the wolf allele frequency of the two alleles to be ~50 %. we propose these patterns are consistent with selection during the domestication process. if so, that selected reduced-fear and aggression variant is narrowed to a two-snp minimal overlap interval of phased haplotypes.

in fig.  <dig> we present a 5 mb chrx region that contains gwa peaks for size, fear and aggression, and sociability. as described above, this region has the highest fst level in the dog genome and has strong ld across  <dig> – <dig>  mb  <cit> . the overall pattern of phased haplotypes and di and si signal suggests the three traits may be distinct. the fear/aggression peak overlaps di and si signal for many breeds, but that for size and sociability do not. however, there is perfect ld between the size and fear/aggression peaks in this haplotype in  <dig> of  <dig> breeds, and more data is necessary to establish their relationship. human mutations in the top chrx candidate gene for fear/aggression, igsf <dig>  are known to affect human growth hormone biology  <cit> , suggesting the two dog traits could share all or some genetic variation at this locus; additionally, expression of the gene abutting the peak snp for size, arghap <dig>  is strongly correlated with igsf <dig> expression . although all but one of the breeds with the fear/aggression-protective allele have perfect ld with the sociability allele, only half of the breeds with the sociability allele have the fear/aggression-protective allele in perfect ld. all breeds with the reduced-fear/aggression allele show di signal overlapping the fear/aggression peak, but there is only one segment of each overlapping the sociability peak. on the other hand, there are eight si segments at the fear and aggression peak , but none is in a breed with the fear/aggression-protective allele.fig.  <dig> mapping phased-haplotypes and s

the predominant signatures of positive selection on the chrx locus thus point to the association with fear and aggression. this is also suggested by the phased haplotype analysis, which shows minimal overlapping regions of  <dig> vs. 284 kb for the fear/aggression-protective and alternative alleles, respectively. in contrast, the appearance of such an effect at the sociability locus is due to the contribution of the  <dig> breeds that carry the fear/aggression-protective allele in perfect ld; and the minimal overlapping regions there are  <dig> vs. 47 kb for the social allele and the non-social allele, respectively. notably, this locus presents the possibility of a special case of hitchhiking in which selection initially occurs on one functional variant , but a second variant in the region is also favored in subsequent selection . as a result, relative to the original variant selected, the ld breaks down only on the side opposite the second selected variant.

based on modern worldwide wolf sequences, the minor chrx allele is that associated with increased-fear/aggression   <cit> . of the diverse  <dig> breeds studied here,  <dig> have frequencies >70 % for the increased-fear/aggression allele and  <dig> have such frequencies for the alternative allele . in the discussion we present the considerations for interpreting this.

virtual fine-mapping of fear and aggression loci on chr <dig> and x
we next interpreted the peak gwas signals and signatures of selection to call the minimal intervals for fear and aggression on chr <dig> and x. vaysse et al. showed that top ranked si and di signals mirror each other in a subset of regions, but the effects are highly variable; and interpretation seems complex and lacking fine resolution. our own experience suggests that di signal is generally more sensitive and precise for fine mapping, but many regions appear to be flagged by reduced and more-diffuse signal of both statistics. here we propose the following scheme: i) the maximum map interval corresponds to the region of overlap of phased haplotypes across all breeds ; and ii) the minimum map interval can combine that with the smallest region of overlap of di or si regions across breeds. in accordance with hitchhiking theory, it seems likely that the maximum map interval for a region under selection will always capture the functional variant. however, it is not clear how precisely that critical region could be narrowed using different signatures of selection; each case could be unique  and is likely to require additional confirmation.

for the chr <dig> fear and aggression locus, the predicted maximum map interval for the most recently selected increased-fear/aggression haplotype is 418 kb and the minimum is 108 kb. however, if there was initially selection for the reduced-fear/aggression allele at domestication and subsequent selection for the increased-fear/aggression allele at the same position , then the maximum and minimum map intervals would be  <dig>  kb. for the chrx locus, the predicted maximum map interval for the reduced-fear/aggression allele is 841 kb, and the minimum map interval is 218 kb. the sociability locus lacks significant di/si evidence and has no phenotype for some of the breeds segregated for the fear and aggression phenotype. the selected sociability allele t thus has maximum and minimum map intervals of 147 kb. notably the original report of this sociability gwa, using the same genotype data, was only suggestive in the full dataset; rather, genomewide significance was detected in analysis of females exclusively, and yielded a peak of  <dig> snps spanning 580 kb  <cit> .

biological relevance of candidate genes
according to the minimal intervals, we have implicated the following genes: i) in the chr <dig> fear and aggression locus, gnat <dig> and cd36; ii) in the chrx fear and aggression locus, igsf <dig>  firre  and stk26; and iii) in the chrx sociability locus, mbnl <dig> and hs6st <dig>  both sociability candidates are expressed in the brain: mbnl <dig> at very low levels and apparently not at all enriched in brain, but hs6st <dig> at very high levels and highly enriched in many brain regions . we favor hs6st <dig> for the sociability association. for the fear and aggression loci, we only see clear biological relevance  for gnat <dig>  cd <dig> and igsf <dig> 

gnat <dig> encodes gustducin alpha, the g alpha subunit that transduces taste receptor signaling. gustducin alpha also has chemosensory roles in the vomeronasal organ, airways and gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . there are also reports that gnat <dig> is expressed in areas of the brain that include the brainstem, hypothalamus and hippocampus . however, those studies targeted specific brain regions and we are not aware of systematic analysis of the entire brain in any mammal. we consulted the allen brain atlas of in situ mrna hybridization analysis  <cit>  and found evidence that gnat <dig> is most highly expressed in the amygdala in the adult mouse, specifically in layer  <dig> of the cortical amigdalar area . that finding is supported by analysis of public gene expression data showing that the highest ranked expression-change of gnat <dig> mrna in any brain region is a  <dig> -fold increase in the amygdala of rats 6 h after pain exposure . the next-highest ranked  gene expression-changes reported in experimental paradigms involving the brain follow: i) rat hippocampus ; ii) mouse cortex ; and iii) mouse striatum . in addition to very high expression in the amygdala, the allen brain atlas of the adult mouse reveals lower levels of expression in parts of the pons: lateral reticular nucleus, paragigantocellular reticular nucleus, lateral part, and the facial motor nucleus.

cd <dig> is an enigmatic protein known to be widely expressed and to have varied biological roles  <cit> . its functions include chemosensory sensing and signaling , sensing and transport of fatty acids in diverse metabolic roles, high affinity binding and signaling of several molecules , and it is a subunit of cell surface scavenger receptors involved in phagocytosis. in the brain, the highest levels of cd <dig> mrna have been mapped to the cortex-amygdala transition zone, medial amygadaloid nucleus, posterior part, hypothalamic premammillary nucleus, ventral part and and ependymal cells of the central canal and fourth ventricle; and high levels are also present in the piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, field ca <dig> of hippocampus, ventral, pyramidal cell layer, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, posterior part, amygdalopiriform transition area, and paraventricular thalamic nucleus, anterior  <cit> . recent studies showed that cd36-/- mice have behavioral phenotypes that include increased anxiety, aggression and locomotor activity  <cit> .

igsf <dig> is immunoglobulin superfamily member  <dig>  common human variation in igsf <dig> is associated with age at menarche, and loss-of function mutations cause a human syndrome of congenital hypothyroidism, macroorchidism, prolactin and growth hormone deficiency, delayed pubertal testosterone and obesity  <cit> . it is expressed very highly in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus, but also in the choroid plexus, adrenal gland, pancreas, heart and skeletal muscle, fetal liver and testis  <cit> . to generate quantitative data, we used the biogps geneatlas of genomewide gene expression in  <dig> mouse tissues and cells. the increased-expression levels, relative to the median for all tissues are as follows: pituitary,  <dig> -fold; hypothalamus, 340; amygdala, 26; heart, 22; spinal cord, 11; hippocampus, 10; placenta, 10; and nucleus accumbens,  <dig>  . immunohistochemical evidence clearly shows that igsf <dig> protein expression is restricted to neurons . notably, there is strong evidence that igsf <dig> is co-expressed with its two flanking genes, arhgap <dig> and the long non-coding rna firre. in the mouse biogps geneatlas of 191-tissues/cells, expression of igsf <dig>  has pearson correlations of  <dig>  with firre  and  <dig>  with arhgap <dig> ; the same probe has a correlation  <dig>  with a second igsf <dig> probe. the human biogps geneatlas of  <dig> tissues/cells lacks a probe for firre, but igsf <dig> and arhgap <dig> have a correlation of  <dig>  . it is thus possible that variation in the igsf <dig> region could also affect the other two genes.

discussion
understanding fear and aggression in dogs is important for canine wellbeing, human public health and to understand the process of dog domestication. it also has great potential to lead to medical translation to related mental disorders in humans. here we mapped behavioral traits by using breed stereotypes to conduct a series of interbreed genome scans. this approach is well developed for morphological traits, but has not been validated for behaviors. in this work, we validate our findings by conducting separate gwas’s using cohorts comprised of partially overlapping breeds. we then provide additional validation by developing a predictive model and applying it successfully to a different group of breeds. this also serves to demonstrate internal consistency of c-barq phenotyping across breeds.

our pca of breed genotypes and phenotypes indicates that some types of fear and aggression are related to each other , but are distinct from others such as owner-directed aggression. this pattern was mirrored by the results of our behavioral gwas’s which identified two genome loci associated with the former  and another two associated with the latter . notably, owner-directed aggression and dog rivalry are associated with the same variation in igf <dig> that is known to have the greatest contribution to small-size across dog breeds . this finding is consistent with previous reports that i) there is a highly-significant correlation between the behaviors of owner-directed aggression and dog rivalry, ii) this correlation is independent of dog- and stranger-directed aggression, and iii) these behaviors are associated with breeds of small to medium size . as owner personality does not necessarily predispose to owner-directed aggression, it is thus an apparent dog trait  <cit> . some of those studies also showed a correlation between small size and stranger-oriented fear and aggression, dog-oriented fear, separation anxiety, and touch sensitivity  <cit> . that is supported by our finding in the confirmation gwas’s that the same small-dog igf <dig> allele is associated with the latter three traits. it is unclear whether the behavioral associations with small-size gene variants are due to developmental, physiological or psychological effects; all seem probable.

the loci on chr <dig> and x are particularly interesting because they may have been originally selected for fear/aggression traits. the four principal loci discussed here – on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x – have experienced very strong selection  and are associated with both behavior and morphology traits. for chr <dig> and  <dig>  the evidence is consistent with the same or overlapping variation causing both traits at each locus. for chr <dig>  the variants for behavior  and morphology  are distinct. some breeds, such as the dachshund, contain the short legs mutation and the nearby increased-fear/aggression variation in the same haplotype   <cit> . other breeds, such as the beagle, border collie, cocker spaniel, english setter and jack russell terrier are common carriers of the same ancestral increased-fear/aggression haplotype on chr <dig>  but are known to lack the chondrodysplasia mutation  <cit> . the chrx locus is a special case because it lies in a region of very strong ld. as a result, the question of independent trait-variants is moot because the original haplotype  was perfectly-associated with size, skull morphology, reduced-fear/aggression and increased sociability. we are not aware that the unspecified skull morphology trait  <cit>  is readily apparent, beneficial or the subject of human interest in any respect . however, whether any of the chr <dig> traits was the primary focus of human selection, all of them would have been essentially-inseparable for a very long time after the initiation of domestication. the question of whether the chrx variation is specific for behavior or shared with that for animal size could be answered by identification and phenotyping of dogs that are recombinant between the two peaks; or, it could be settled by making caninized mice for the two alternative sequences at each peak region.

the closest genes to the chr <dig> and x association peaks are gnat <dig>  and cd <dig>  and igsf <dig> , respectively. the fear/aggression peak near igsf <dig> lies within a  <dig> – <dig>  mb region of strong ld that includes flanking peaks for size and sociability  <cit> . the reduced-fear/aggression allele on chrx is often in perfect ld with the increased-size allele, but much less so with regards to the increased-sociability peak allele. we suggest that the fear/aggression functional variants on chr <dig> and x are most likely to affect expression of gnat <dig> and/or cd <dig>  and igsf <dig>  respectively. . both of those neuronal genes have strong biological relevance at the level of neuroanatomy. outside taste receptor and other chemosensory cells , gnat <dig> is most highly expressed in the amygdala. cd <dig> is most highly expressed in the cortex-amygdala transition zone, regions of the amygdala and hypothalamus and ependymal cells of the central canal and fourth ventricle. igsf <dig> is predominantly and very abundantly expressed in two brain regions - the pituitary and parts of the hypothalamus  <cit> . further studies are necessary to determine if the size and fear/aggression traits on chrx are due to the same, distinct or overlapping variation. it is interesting that at least three genes in the region are co-expressed in tissues involved in determination of body size , and that mutations in igsf <dig> affect human size  <cit> . importantly, new studies show that cd36-knockout mice have behavioral traits that include increased aggression, anxiety and locomotor activity  <cit> . rat studies have revealed that mrna expression of both other genes are regulated in fear-relevant models: gnat <dig> in amygdala under pain stimuli  <cit> ; and igsf <dig> in cortex after stress or tactile stimuli  <cit> . thus both genes are also strong candidates for fear relevance: they are neuronal and associated with stress/anxiety according to interbreed dog gwa, neuroanatomy and biology.

because our model of the chr <dig> and x variation was successful in predicting the relevant fear and aggression behaviors in a third group of non-overlapping breeds, we believe these markers can be used to predict and, in part, explain such behavior across many dog breeds. however, the behavioral stereotypes of some breeds were not explained by our predictive model, and many breeds have not been tested. it seems likely that many breeds have epistatic variation with chr <dig> and x variants or have other variants that are less commonly associated with these traits across dog breeds. all of these issues can be addressed by studies of individual breeds. since we have only found the common co-occurrence of the increased-fear/aggression variation on chr <dig> and x in small and medium dogs, it will be interesting to see if this is also present in large dogs bred for aggression or fighting.

dogs were the first animals to be domesticated by humans. new studies indicate that dog domestication has a single origin in southern east asia ~ <dig>  years ago, followed by migration to the middle east, africa and europe ~ <dig>  years ago  <cit> . canine fear and aggression are of great interest because those traits – mainly the loss of fear of humans – are widely believed to underlie the mechanism for domestication  <cit> . we thus considered whether the variation we identified at chr <dig> and x could have been involved in the process of dog domestication. our analysis of published genetic variation from extant wolf populations across the world shows that both fear/aggression alleles  are common in wolves – approximately 50 %  <cit>  and 43 %  <cit> , respectively. in domesticated dogs,  <dig> of  <dig> breeds in fig.  <dig> have the reduced fear/aggression chr <dig> allele at a frequency of at least 75 % . in contrast, only 10/ <dig> breeds have the reduced-fear/aggression chrx allele at frequencies greater than that of wolves . the common high-frequencies of the chr <dig> reduced-fear/aggression allele across dog breeds are consistent with selection of reduced fear and aggression in the domestication of dogs. interpretation of the chrx region seems less clear because the majority of breeds have the increased-fear/aggression allele. however, we show that the reduced fear/aggression allele has been under selection . the high frequency of the four alleles at chr18/x in extant wolf populations may seem counterintuitive in a model where ancestral wolves were generally more fearful and aggressive than domesticated dogs, but this could be explained by balancing selection or recent positive selection.

a concrete understanding of dog domestication may soon emerge, as there is a major effort underway to sequence ancient dog genomes  <cit> . our prediction is that positive selection of the reduced-fear variants on chr <dig>  and chrx  was part of the domestication process. this raises a previously unappreciated possibility – that the putative selection of less fearful/aggressive proto-domesticated dogs was of animals that were at the large end of the spectrum . for example, domestication of the largest wolves may have been favored for protection  or hunting large game . we further propose that humans have obscured those roots in modern dog breeds by selecting for increased aggression or for other linked morphological or behavioral traits . we expect there are many other fear/aggression-associated loci that are more difficult to map across breeds. but it seems likely that having two very common alleles influencing these behaviors led to frequent selection between those to set a level of reactivity and disposition towards dogs and humans. in this regard, it seems plausible that the correlation between small size and the highest levels of fear/aggression is because the same behavior in large dogs is generally unacceptable to humans  <cit> . in our principal mapping study, only small dogs – mainly dachshund and yorkshire terrier – have high frequency of fear/aggression associated alleles at both chr <dig> and x. the fact that dog and stranger oriented fear and aggression are generally much more strongly associated with chr <dig> and x variants than with igf1/chr <dig>  hmga2/chr <dig> and igf1r/chr <dig> small-size variants further establishes that small size is not the predominant cause. however, it is also notable that a subset of large breeds carries the chrx reduced-fear/aggression and increased-size variants in perfect ld.

the biochemistry and neuroanatomy of the emotions of fear and aggression are highly conserved in vertebrates, and some argue this is true across the animal kingdom  <cit> . across vertebrates the most immediate response to extreme threat involves the transmission of different sensory signals through the following sequence of brain regions : thalamus, amydgala, hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which sends nerve and hormonal signals to the adrenal glands, which in turn direct acute  and sustained  stress responses. this low road corresponds to innately programmed responses and is associated with emotions such as fear and anger. a parallel cognitive pathway that is referred to as the high road diverges at the thalamus, by then going to primary sensory and association centers in the cortex before continuing to the amygdala. both pathways also involve bidirectional signaling with the hippocampus. thus, while the immediate response to fear may be predominantly innate and emotional, it is not completely separate from cognition. there is extensive molecular and behavioral evidence that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis is the most critical driver of behavioral stress. biochemical pathways implicated in social fear and aggression include signaling by serotonin and dopamine, and neuropeptides such as the predominantly-hypothalamic oxytocin and vasopressin  <cit> . notably, the domestication of another canid, the fox, resulted in foxes with greatly reduced hpa activity  <cit> . after  <dig> generations of selection for tameness in foxes, basal blood cortisol levels were reduced three-fold and stress-induced levels five-fold . domesticated foxes also have increased levels of brain serotonin, consistent with its inhibitory effect on aggression. new analysis of selective sweep regions associated with domestication of pigs showed that gnat3-cd <dig> lies in one of the sweep regions of european  pigs  <cit> ; but it remains to be seen if gnat3-cd <dig> variation is directly associated with that domestication event. our findings that loci spanning gnat3-cd <dig>  and igsf <dig>  are associated with canine fear and aggression are thus consistent with a very large body of work implicating the hpa axis.

it is clear from animal and human studies that fear and aggression are often associated, but it is not always in the same direction  <cit> . based on human behavior and pharmacology, the links between anxiety and aggression are very complex. similarly, early life stresses in people and animals are associated in complex ways with anxiety disorders and aggression in adulthood. early life stress generally involves changes in the hpa axis, and results in increased anxiety and altered social and aggressive behaviors. animal models with a profile similar to the dog case presented here – in which both fear and aggression are elevated – are rare. examples of knockout models that have this property include those for enkephalin  <cit>  and α-calcium-calmodulin kinase ii  <cit> . selective breeding has also yielded strains that have increases in both anxiety and aggression. one of those is the north carolina mouse, in which acute diazepam treatment reduces both anxiety and aggression  <cit> . the other example is a strain of novosibirsk norway rats that was bred for increased aggression to humans  <cit> . it is not immediately clear which human conditions may be most relevant to the present dog model at chr <dig> and x. most likely those will include anxiety disorders. notably, some anxiety conditions are associated with increased aggression, and this includes a subset of those affected by social anxiety.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified common variants associated with fear and aggression across dog breeds. these can now be biologically dissected at the levels of development, epigenetics, neuroanatomy, physiology and behavior  or in genetically-modified rodent models. among the areas of research on fear and aggression  <cit>  that are ongoing in dogs and will be vastly accelerated by genetic handles are i) development and environmental-malleability  <cit> ; ii) molecular/biochemical and imaging descriptions at baseline and under acute stress  <cit> , iii) effects on mental and physiological states in the life course , and iv) feasibility to mitigate negative effects through cognitive or pharmacological treatments  <cit> . in parallel, it will be important to determine the molecular mechanisms of these fear/aggression variants, and to identify their interactions with other genes and environmental factors.
