BACKGROUND
the family of sox transcription factors is defined by the presence of a conserved high mobility-group  domain that mediates dna-binding and is highly similar to that of the sex-determining region  protein  <cit> . based on phylogenic analysis of hmg domain sequences and full-length protein sequences/functional features, sox genes are classified into  <dig> groups from a to j  <cit> . they display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns and have been implicated in regulation of a wide range of developmental processes  <cit> . sox proteins exert gene activation or repression by binding to a consensus dna motif, with or without aid of other transcription factors  <cit> . available evidence indicates that a particular sox protein can mediate expression of various target genes through recognizing different binding sites during the formation of many tissues  <cit> . selection of specific target genes by sox proteins depends on flanking sequences of the consensus core, homo-/hetero-dimerization of sox proteins at recognition sites and association with other transcription factors  <cit> .

the soxd group is composed of sox <dig>  sox <dig> and sox <dig>  <cit> . human sox <dig> is primarily expressed in the short  and long form  of transcripts  <cit> . l-sox <dig> cdna is predicted to encode a 763-amino-acid protein that exceeds s-sox <dig> by  <dig> residues  <cit> . s-sox <dig>  which lacks n-terminal domain required for dimerization with other soxd proteins, is predominantly detected in testis and brain while l-sox <dig> is expressed in multiple tissues including testis, heart, liver and skeletal muscle  <cit> . the difference in the protein structure and tissue distribution between the two forms of sox <dig> implies distinct biological functions for these isoforms. the two sox <dig> isoforms are conserved in mouse  <cit> . mouse s-sox <dig> was originally cloned from testis  <cit> . the restricted presence of mouse orthologue s-sox <dig> proteins in round spermatids and regulation of testis-related gene expression by s-sox <dig> suggests that s-sox <dig> plays a specialized role in spermatogenesis within the testis . later studies demonstrated that mouse s-sox <dig> is also expressed in the lung and brain, tissues bearing motile cilia  <cit> , and it is capable of activating expression of sperm-associated antigen  <dig> gene , whose translated product is enriched in the tissues with motile cilia, particularly in the testis  <cit> .

mammalian sperm-associated antigen  <dig>  is the orthologue of chlamydomonas reinhardtii pf <dig> that encodes an axonemal protein essential for flagellar motility. chlamydomonas mutants carrying pf <dig> mutation display paralyzed flagella with defects in axonemal central apparatus  <cit> . both mouse and human spag <dig> genes are expressed as two major transcripts of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb with different expression patterns. the human  <dig>  kb transcript was detected in multiple tissues whereas the human  <dig>  transcript was highly expressed in testis  <cit> . mouse  <dig>  kb transcript has a similar tissue distribution as the human orthologue; however, the  <dig>  kb transcript is only present in mouse testis  <cit> . the translated 71 kda  and 35 kda  proteins have different locations and functions in male germ cells. spag16l is located in the axoneme central apparatus of sperms and plays a crucial role in sperm motility. besides the similar localization as spag16l, spag16s is also present in the nucleus of post-meiotic germ cells and seems to be essential for viability of these cells during spermatogenesis  <cit> .

given that both s-sox <dig> and spag16l are present in tissues containing cells with motile cilia/flagella, it is hypothesized that expression of spag16l is regulated by s-sox <dig>  in the present work, we report bioinformatic and biochemical characterization of the human spag16l promoter. the in silico prediction showed multiple putative binding sites for sox <dig> in the spag16l promote region. the empirical evidence revealed that s-sox <dig> activates expression of spag16l via direct interaction with sox <dig> binding sites at the spag16l promoter.

RESULTS
s-sox <dig> stimulates human spag16l promoter in beas-2b cells
we have previously used the consite program to predict transcription factors of human spag16l and found multiple putative sox5-binding sites in the 2-kb proximal promoter region of spag16l  <cit> . to explore the influence of s-sox <dig> on expression of spag16l, a transcriptional luc fusion was made by cloning a 2-kb dna fragment containing the spag16l proximal promoter into pgl3-basic vector. the resultant construct  was co-transfected with s-sox <dig> expression plasmids  into human bronchial epithelial cells beas-2b and the relative luciferase activity was measured. endogenous expression of s-sox <dig> has been reported in beas-2b cells, suggesting this cell line can be used to study s-sox5-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . the basal level of spag16l expression was detected, which is about 10× higher than that of the control empty pgl3-basic plasmids. when co-transfected with s-sox <dig>  the relative luciferase activity was elevated about 100-folds . these results indicate that s-sox <dig> stimulates transcription of human spag16l.fig.  <dig> effect of s-sox <dig> on the human spag16l promoter activity. 2-kb human spag16l promoter construct was transfected to beas-2b cells. the cells were also co-transfected with s-sox5/pcdna <dig> or empty pcdna <dig> plasmid. the promoter activity was measured by dual luciferase assays after 48 h transfection. values indicate mean ± s.e.  of the relative luciferase activity . *p <  <dig>   compared to the control




levels of spag16l mrna are elevated by exogenous s-sox5
the effect of s-sox <dig> on the expression level of spag16l mrna in beas-2b cells was examined. to this end, beas-2b cells stably expressing s-sox <dig>  or infected with s-sox <dig> adenovirus  were generated, and expression of s-sox <dig> protein in these cells was confirmed by western blot analysis. even though, s-sox <dig> was undetected in the controls, the s-sox <dig> protein  was produced in both cell lines and clearly increased when infected with s-sox <dig> adenovirus . to measure the relative abundance of spag16l mrna in the same cells, real-time pcr was performed. as expected, the relative level of spag16l mrna in both cell types was significantly higher than that in the control . the results show that exogenous s-sox <dig> is able to increase spag16l mrna levels.fig.  <dig> exogenous s-sox <dig> up-regulates spag16l mrna expression in beas-2b cells. a western blot analysis of s-sox <dig> protein levels in besa-2b cells stably expressing s-sox <dig>  or infected with ads-sox <dig>  detected with the pico system. b analysis of spag16l mrna expression by real-time pcr. gapdh was also amplified simultaneously to normalize the results. values indicate mean ± s.e.  of the relative mrna level . *p <  <dig>   compared to the controls




knockdown of s-sox <dig> in beas-2b cells reduces expression of spag16l
to further investigate the regulatory role of s-sox <dig> on spag16l expression, two human sox <dig> rnai constructs that respectively target portion 225- <dig> and 1109- <dig> of the sox <dig> transcript were used  <cit> . the beas-2b cells were co-transfected with these constructs or sox <dig> expression plasmids . the efficiency of the sox <dig> rnai plasmids was examined by western blot analysis. both rnai constructs were able to decrease s-sox <dig> protein levels, but the construct targeting portion 1109- <dig> of the sox <dig> transcript led to a remarkable reduction of s-sox <dig> . moreover, the abundance of spag16l mrna in the beas-2b cells was measured by real-time pcr. it was decreased correspondingly with two different rnai constructs . these data suggest that expression of spag16l depends on the activity of s-sox <dig> protein.fig.  <dig> knockdown of s-sox <dig> in beas-2b cells by rnai results in decrease of spag16l mrna. a western blot analysis of s-sox <dig> proteins in beas-2b cells stably expressing two rnai constructs. b after rnai treatment, the levels of s-sox <dig> in beas-2b cells were estimated by analysing intensity of protein bands using imagej software. c analysis of spag16l mrna expression by real-time pcr in beas-2b cells transfected with two sox <dig> rnai constructs. silencing of s-sox <dig> by rnai reduced expression of spag16l. values indicate mean ± s.e.  of the relative mrna level . *p <  <dig>   compared to the control




s-sox <dig> binds to the human spag16l promoter
to study the molecular interaction between s-sox <dig> and the spag16l promoter, beas-2b cells were infected with s-sox <dig> adenovirus  and chip assay was conducted with an antibody specifically against s-sox <dig> or rabbit igg. two primer sets flanking putative sox <dig> binding sites were designed; as a control, another primer set located about 3 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site without flanking any sox <dig> binding site was also designed . compared to using the rabbit igg, more pcr products were amplified by two pcr primer sets flanking putative sox <dig> binding sites when chip was performed using the sox <dig> antibody . however, the control primer set was unable to amplify more specific dna fragments . the result was consistent with the statistical analysis of the relative abundance of the pcr products . these results suggest that s-sox <dig> is capable of binding to the promoter of spag16l.

mutation of sox <dig> binding sites abolishes activation of the spag16l promoter in beas-2b cells
to study if s-sox <dig> activates spag16l transcription via interacting with the sox <dig> binding sites, a 300-bp spag16l promoter construct encompassing two putative sox <dig> binding sites was generated. the resultant transcriptional fusion construct was transfected into beas-2b cells and relative luciferase activity was analyzed. the spag16l promoter showed basal level activity which is about 10× higher than that of the control . as expected, co-transfection of s-sox <dig> largely stimulated the spag16l promoter activity when both putative sox <dig> binding sites  were present . mutation in the p-ii site had little effect on the elevation of spag16l promoter activity, suggesting that the p-ii site is not required for s-sox5-mediated activation of spag16l. interestingly, mutations in either the p-i site or both sites  led to higher baseline promoter activities; however, the promoter activities were not increased in the presence of s-sox <dig> . the results suggest that the p-i site probably contributes to the repression of spag16l by unknown factor in the absence of s-sox <dig> and is also essential for activation of spag16l by s-sox <dig> fig.  <dig> functional analyses of s-sox <dig> binding sites in the human spag16l promoter. left maps of the wild-type human spag16l promoter construct containing two putative sox <dig> binding sites  and the constructs with mutations of the potential sox <dig> binding sites. right, effect of s-sox <dig> on the function of the wild-type and mutated spag16l promoter. beas-2b cells were co-transfected with spag16l promoter constructs and either pcdna <dig> control or s-sox5/pcdna <dig>  relative luciferase activity, normalized to pgl <dig> control plasmids co-transfected with pcdna <dig> vectors. values are mean ± s.e.  of the relative luciferase activity . bars labeled with different letters are significantly different 




discussion
cilia are evolutionarily conserved, filamentous cellular structures that are present on the cell surface and have been implicated in the sensing of environmental signals and cellular motility  <cit> . based on the axonemal architectures, cilia can be classified into two major forms: “9 + 0” and “9 + 2” axonemal arrangements  <cit> . primary cilia contain a “9 + 0” axoneme and usually non-motile, and detect mechanical and chemical signals from the surrounding environment. dysfunction of primary cilia can lead to various human diseases including primary ciliary dyskinesia, polycystic kidney disease and retinal degeneration  <cit> . motile cilia have a “9 + 2” axoneme that is composed of nine doublet microtubules and a central pair of microtubules. the associated structures of the “9 + 2” axoneme such as radial spokes and dynein arms are crucial for mediation of cilia motility  <cit> . motile cilia are widely present in mammalian tissues including trachea, brain, spinal canal and sperm. defects in motile cilia have been linked to diverse symptoms including hydrocephalus, sinusitis and bronchiectasis, situs inversus and male infertility  <cit> .

fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms mediate expression of stage-specific genes for the formation of distinct types of cilia during ciliogenesis. the sophisticated genetic program of ciliogenesis is modulated probably through the precise presence and maintenance of essential proteins in a time- and tissue-dependent manner  <cit> . empirical evidence shows that expression of ciliary genes is transcriptionally regulated and some transcriptional factors involved in ciliogenesis have been identified. these transcription factors include: hnf1β   <cit> , fkh- <dig>   <cit> , rfx family of transcription factors  <cit> , and foxj <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . among them, rfx and foxj <dig> are two major transcriptional factors that control ciliogenesis. rfx proteins function as transcriptional regulators that interact with the x-box motif at mhc class ii gene promoters  <cit> . functional analyses of rfx regulators indicate that they are required for modulating expression of key genes involved in different stages of ciliogenesis, including formation of ciliated sensory neurons, basal body migration and membrane docking, intraflagellar transport and ciliary motility .

foxj <dig> belongs to the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional factors  <cit> . loss-of-function analyses of foxj <dig> demonstrate the requirement of this gene for biosynthesis of motile cilia in mouse tissues  <cit> . a number of target genes of foxj <dig> that are involved in ciliary motility have been identified in model organisms such as zebrafish and xenopus. this suggests that foxj <dig> is a master transcriptional factor of motile ciliogenesis  <cit> .

our earlier studies demonstrated that s-sox <dig>  together with foxj <dig>  regulates expression of an axonemal gene, spag <dig>  <cit> . to explore if s-sox <dig> also regulates other genes that are essential for motile cilia structure and/or function, and functions as a general transcription factor to control motile cilia/function, we decided to investigate if s-sox <dig> regulates another axonemal central apparatus gene, spag16l, because the spag16l proximal promoter region also contains multiple putative sox <dig> binding sites. our findings demonstrated that s-sox <dig> does regulate spag16l transcription through binding to the sox <dig> binding sites. however, it should be aware that not all the putative sox <dig> binding sites predicted by bioinformatic analysis are functional. one of the two putative sox <dig> binding sites analysed in this study is not bound by s-sox <dig>  thus, experiments must be conducted to verify if these putative binding sites are functional. overall, this study presents another example that s-sox <dig> regulates another gene essential for motile cilia function, and supports the notion that s-sox <dig> is a general transcription factor to control formation and function of motile cilia.

sperm flagella are special motile cilia. during spermiogenesis, germ cells undergo dramatic morphological changes as they develop into functional sperm. these changes include formation of flagella. sperm flagella contain a “9 + 2” axoneme. besides this core axoneme structure, other affiliated structures, including the fibrous sheath and outer dense fibers, are also assembled into the sperm flagella  <cit> . s-sox <dig> was originally cloned from mouse testis  <cit>  and it is able to activate transcription of a group of testis-related gene such as iκbβ, znf <dig> and catsper <dig>  <cit>  given that s-sox <dig> is only expressed in tissues with motile cilia, particularly in the post-meiotic round spermatids  <cit> , we hypothesize that this transcription factor regulates a suite of genes for motile cilia formation/function, particularly for sperm flagella formation/function. recent gwas studies suggest that the sox <dig> locus is associated with male infertility  <cit> , and the high expression level of s-sox <dig> in the testis implies that s-sox <dig> plays an important role in regulating expression of the genes that are essential for sperm function and male fertility.

the in vivo function of s-sox <dig> is still not known. however, the unique exon not present in l-sox <dig> allows us to make mutant mice with disruption of s-sox <dig> only. using this model, we will be able to study the function of s-sox <dig> in vivo, and probably identify the target genes regulated by s-sox <dig> globally.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of human spag16l by s-sox <dig>  s-sox <dig> activates transcription of spag16l through specifically interacting with sox <dig> binding sites at the spag16l promoter. the data suggest that s-sox <dig> plays a regulatory role in the formation of cilia/flagella.
