BACKGROUND
members of the parvulin family of peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases  are involved in mitotic regulatory mechanisms and cell proliferation  <cit> . the human genome only encodes two parvulin proteins – pin <dig> and parvulin. pin <dig> is a well studied mitotic regulator involved in cell cycle and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . overexpression of pin <dig> was found in several tumor types  <cit> ; inhibition of this enzyme leads to apoptosis in a ras-transformed cell line  <cit> . the second member of the parvulin ppiase family, the  <dig> kda protein parvulin <dig>  <cit>  , is assumed to be involved in cell cycle progression or chromatin remodeling  <cit> . pin <dig> and par <dig> sequences are found in all multi-cellular organisms from n. crassa and c. elegans to man, whereas yeasts contain only one parvulin homolog called ess <dig>  the lethal phenotype of ess <dig> deletion can only be rescued by human pin <dig> but not by hpar <dig>  <cit>  suggesting divergent cellular functions for the two human parvulins.

although the c-terminal ppiase domains of human pin <dig> and par <dig> proteins are similar both in sequence and in three-dimensional structure, their n-terminal domains differ significantly. whereas hpin <dig> carries an n-terminal ww motif  <cit> , the basic domain of hpar <dig>  is unfolded in solution  <cit> . par <dig> is localized in cytosol and nucleus with deletion studies pointing to a nuclear import signal located within the basic n-terminal part  <cit> . within the nucleus, par <dig> was reported to bind to pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles  <cit> , and sequence specifically to bent double stranded dna  <cit> . such bent a/t rich segments of dna are supposed to dictate nucleosome positioning and play a role in transcription initiation. the n-terminal part of par <dig> is necessary for high affinity dna binding. phosphorylation within this region at ser <dig> regulates nuclear localization and dna binding  <cit> .

within the n-terminal basic domain par <dig> shows 45% homology to the region surrounding the chromatin unfolding domain of hmgn proteins  <cit> , whose residues are involved in contacts to nucleosomal dna. a structural feature called the hmgb domain which is well known from transcription factors lef- <dig> or sry can be found as part of the catalytic domain within the first alpha-helix of the ppiase domain of parvulin  <cit> . this motif includes a hydrophobic patch  that conforms to a minor groove binding mode. for the transcription factor lef- <dig> these residues were shown to be essential for contacting dna within the minor groove and for inducing bent dna structures.

despite all these data, there are several open questions concerning the cellular function of parvulin. in this study we confirm by rt-pcr the existence of a longer parvulin isoform that has an extension at the 5' end including a  <dig> bp extended open reading frame. as e.coli par <dig> and human par <dig> are numbered according to their molecular weight, we refer to the novel parvulin isoform as par <dig> 

RESULTS
identification and quantification of new isoforms of human parvulin mrna
recently, the parvulin refseq  <cit>  entry for human parvulin  was updated by incorporating a 5' extension of about  <dig> nucleotides relative to the original database entries  <cit> . this sequence was only encoded by one expressed sequence tag  . to prove this extension to occur within cells, we performed rt-pcr on human mrnas from different tissues. as the 5' extension contains an additional start codon 75bases upstream of the original start codon, primers were designed to confirm the occurrence of both the short par <dig> and the extended open reading frames by rt-pcr. a schematic representation of the parvulin mrna together with the positioning of primers is given in figure 1a. the pcr products corresponding to the 5' extension and total parvulin mrna were detected in all tissues tested so far. the pcr signal for the 5' extension is much weaker than the total parvulin pcr product. rt-pcr bands from liver, kidney and caco- <dig> cdnas are shown exemplarily in figure 1b.

all  <dig> bp dna fragments corresponding to the elongated parvulin mrna were eluted from gels and sequenced. thereby, two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms  leading to two amino acid substitutions q16r and r18s were detected within the 5' extension that are also referenced in the ncbi snp database as rs <dig> and rs <dig>  respectively. out of  <dig> different cdnas sequenced, only two did contain these mutations, the liver and kidney cdna samples used in this study. we only have observed the coupled occurrence of these two snps. in addition, these two cdnas had the silent gcc to gct mutation at ala <dig>  within the known part of the par <dig> mrna. the first  <dig> nucleotides of the elongated parvulin mrna together with the detected coupled snps are depicted in figure 1c.

to quantify relative amounts of different parvulin mrna isoforms, real-time pcr primers that detect the novel 5' extension and total parvulin mrna  were designed and confirmed to yield uniform pcr products by agarose gel electrophoresis. mrnas from different sources were extensively treated with dnase to degrade any traces of genomic dna and reverse transcribed. the above mentioned primers were then used to perform real-time pcr with sybr green detection on the resulting cdnas to analyze the extended and total parvulin messages. the melting curves of the generated pcr products are shown in figure 2a. therein the maxima represent the melting points of the corresponding pcr products with  <dig> °c for the fragment corresponding to total parvulin mrnas. the melting curves for the pcr products originating from the parvulin 5' extension can be grouped into two ensembles with about 82°c and 83°c melting temperatures. the former corresponds to the above mentioned qr variant; the elevated melting point of the latter can be explained by two at base pairs changed to gc bases in the rs variant. thus, the primers used in this study should enable fast real-time snp detection of rs and qr genotypes in other human cdnas or patient samples.

relative amounts of long parvulin mrna and total parvulin mrna were then calculated based on the real-time pcr data. the fraction of the long isoform within total parvulin mrna is given in figure 2b ranging from  <dig> % in the skeletal muscle cdna sample used for this study to  <dig> % in a cdna from the submandibularis gland.

an elongated parvulin isoform is expressed in human cell lines
as not every atg codon is necessarily used for translation initiation, we attempted to translate the different coding sequences of parvulin in vitro. therefore, the open reading frames for the qr and rs parvulin variants as well as par <dig> were topo-cloned into the vector pcr- <dig> and 35s-methionine labeled in a t <dig> polymerase/reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system figure 3a. a 14kda translation product was produced both from the short and elongated parvulin templates suggesting that the context of the second atg is suited for translation initiation despite the lack of a classical kozak sequence  <cit> . in addition, qr and rs parvulin templates yielded a translation product of about 17kda in agreement with a theoretical molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. therefore, we refer to the novel parvulin isoform from now on as par <dig> according to the denotation of other parvulins  <cit> . although parvulin is also referred to as pin <dig> in databases we prefer the name par14/par <dig> to avoid confusion with a putative auxin efflux carrier protein from arabidopsis that is incidentally named pin <dig>  too.

the longer parvulin mrna encodes a protein n-terminally extended by  <dig> amino acids. tblast searches with this n-terminal protein sequence as query neither yield significant similarities in the nr database of genbank nor at other loci within the human genome. the extension is predicted to adopt an additional amphipatic alpha-helix in the protein  <cit> . rulten et al. and sekerina et al. reported fast degradation of the basic and flexible domain of par <dig> by chymotrypsin and an e. coli protease, respectively  <cit> . we were interested, whether the amphipatic helix might be able to stabilize the degradable protein part by binding to the catalytic domain or by masking it. thus, the structural integrity of par <dig> was tested by limited proteinasek digestion. at minor enzyme concentrations  the 35s-methionine labeled short parvulin is degraded leaving over the catalytic domain only . for degradation of the long protein isoforms at least five-fold higher protease concentrations are needed. this indicates that the n-terminal elongation seems to protect the protease sensitive basic region from being digested rapidly.

next, we wanted to prove the expression of the elongated parvulin isoform in human cells. therefore, a polyclonal antibody was raised against an epitope within the n-terminal extension of human par <dig> that was shaded in gray in figure 1c. this antibody recognized both the q16/r <dig> and r16/s <dig> isoforms of the elongated parvulin protein overexpressed in e. coli with slightly higher affinity towards the rs form  but does not recognize gfp fused par <dig> expressed in hela cells that lacks the n-terminal extension . thus, the expression of the elongated protein can be detected irrespective of the particular genotype. in most fresh protein lysates from hela and hepg <dig> cells, only the  <dig> kda species was detected . in addition, we detected a  <dig> kda species in other hela and hepg <dig> lysates. after repeated freeze-thaw cycles, this second protein species at  <dig> kda gained intensity with the  <dig> kda band appearing much weaker . despite the presence of protease inhibitors, this observation could be attributed to the already reported high protease sensitivity of parvulin  <cit> .

an antibody against the ppiase domain was used to detect parvulin isoforms in hepg <dig> and hela cell lysates . as the fast degradation of the 28kda protein species prevented co-immunoprecipitation studies a final proof for the presence of a par17-sumo2/ <dig> conjugate is still missing.

the above mentioned polyclonal antibody against the isolated ppiase domain of par <dig> was also used in previously performed western blot studies of human cell lysates . in both studies, there was a protein species detected at  <dig> kda in addition to the par <dig> band. in addition, reimer et al. applied hek <dig> cell lysates to dna-cellulose; bound proteins were eluted by increasing salt concentrations. parallel to the detected par <dig> band, another protein species was clearly visible at about  <dig> kda which we now have identified as modified par <dig>  therefore, we propose that par <dig> may be able to bind genomic dna in a similar manner to par <dig> 

transcriptional initiation at the human parvulin promoter
the present study shows that in addition to the original par <dig> protein elongated isoforms of parvulin are expressed in human cells. the question arises whether these isoforms are encoded by alternative open reading frames. a genome wide blast search revealed sequences on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> that show a high degree of sequence similarity to the well known parvulin locus on chromosome xq <dig> with the gene name pin <dig>  as they do not encode an n-terminal elongation and are only 87%  and 97%  identical to the described parvulin sequence, these putative pseudogenes are not responsible for the occurrence of the isoforms in human tissues observed in our studies. therefore we conclude that the different isoforms must be encoded by the pin <dig> gene on chromosome xq <dig> 

the sequence preceding the transcription start site displays an extraordinarily high cpg ratio  and a gc content of  <dig> % , but lacks conserved tata boxes and downstream promoter elements. only one sequence motif immediately upstream of the first nucleotides of the longest est shows some similarity to the consensus initiator sequence  <cit> . tata-less promoters within cpg islands are typical for housekeeping genes. they lack one strong promoter but instead contain several weak promoter elements  <cit>  resulting in more than one transcription initiation sites.

using the extended cdna sequence for human parvulin as query, the est database of genbank was searched by blast  <cit> . for alignment only est clones sequenced from their 5' end exceeding an overlap of  <dig> nt with the original cdna entry of uchida et al. were taken  <cit> . intron containing ests were removed manually from this collection, thereby excluding one 5' extended est . from the remaining  <dig> database entries only the above mentioned au <dig> encoded the long isoform corresponding to  <dig> % of all sequences. this ratio between long and total parvulin mrna is in good agreement with our real-time data. thus, both a short and an extended version of parvulin mrna occur within human cells. taken the short length of parvulin mrnas of about  <dig> kb, we assume most if not all of these est sequences to be full length. therefore, we aligned all parvulin ests sequenced from the 5' end which should be indicative for the initiation of transcription at the parvulin locus. all ests differed to a certain extent in their 5' start. these different transcript starting points are in agreement with transcriptional initiation from different weak initiator points within a cpg island promoter that give raise to different parvulin isoforms.

parvulin genes in other organisms
the ppiase sequence of par <dig> is very well conserved from n. crassa and c. elegans to man with identities of  <dig> % and  <dig> % compared to the human sequence. therefore it was interesting to search for extended parvulin variants in other organisms as well. genomic parvulin sequences were available from  <dig> different species  which were compared with regard to additional coding regions preceding the par <dig> coding sequence. a sequence from canis familiaris more likely resembled the above mentioned parvulin pseudogene and was not further analyzed. genomic sequences from chimp and chicken only contained the last two of the four parvulin exons with otherwise very similar exon length. despite all efforts, no more upstream sequence information was available for these organisms from internet resources. even the recently published improved chimp sequence only contains parvulin exons three and four  <cit> . with the exception of c.elegans and insects, all parvulin genes were identical in their genomic structure. they all contained one or more additional start codons within an area  <dig> bp upstream of the par <dig> atg, however nowhere – not even in mammals such as mus musculus or bos taurus – these atgs resulted in extended open reading frames with similarities to human par <dig> . it will be especially interesting to search for par <dig> within an improved version of the chimp genome in the near future. in contrast to the ubiquitous occurrence of par <dig>  the expression of the elongated isoform par <dig> seems to be limited to some mammals with proven expression up to now only in homo sapiens.

CONCLUSIONS
par <dig> is highly conserved in all metazoans. human parvulin mrna is expressed in all tissues examined so far pointing to ubiquitous expression. the tata-less parvulin promoter is situated in a cpg island typical for house keeping genes; such promoters often contain several weak transcription start points. at least in humans this alternative transcription initiation gives raise to multiple mrna isoforms which could be proven by rt- and real-time pcr. these mrnas encode the formerly known par <dig> as well as n-terminally extended par <dig>  this longer protein is expressed in hela and hepg <dig> cells and is probably post-translationally modified. its solution structure and catalytic properties as well as interactions with possible partners can now be addressed.
