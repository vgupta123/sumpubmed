BACKGROUND
the construction of genetic linkage maps in model organisms and domesticated species enables studies of the genetic architecture of trait variation and genome evolution. however, such resources for free-living populations of non-model species are still rare because it is difficult to acquire large enough pedigrees and associated sets of molecular markers  <cit> . the utility of genetic linkage maps developed using pedigreed wild populations has been demonstrated by pioneering studies on the genetic architecture of trait variation  <cit> , genetic constraints  <cit>  and patterns of linkage disequilibrium  <cit>  under semi-natural settings. yet, we still know very little about these specific topics and the potential to address a variety of additional subjects remains largely unexploited  <cit> . the development of linkage maps for additional natural populations is therefore clearly desirable.

the bighorn sheep , a mountain ungulate inhabiting western north america  <cit> , is one species for which linkage map construction using free-living individuals is possible. dna samples from intensively studied pedigreed populations have been collected over many decades by field biologists  and a large set of polymorphic microsatellite markers was recently derived from domestic sheep genomic resources  <cit> . a bighorn sheep linkage map would enable one to dissect the molecular genetic basis of fitness-related traits, study the molecular basis of inbreeding depression and genetic rescue  <cit> , and potentially reveal the molecular genetic basis of human-influenced evolution  <cit> .

in addition to generating species-specific research opportunities, a bighorn sheep map would shed light on the levels of genomic re-organization between bighorn and domestic sheep. while few differences are expected between these species due to their recent divergence , shared karyotype  <cit>  and ability to produce fertile hybrids  <cit> , enough time has elapsed for rearrangements to accumulate  <cit> . for example, numerous small-scale rearrangements have been documented between domestic sheep and the slightly more genetically distant domestic goat, capra hircus  <cit> , which can also interbreed with domestic sheep  <cit> . reorganization has also been observed among domestic sheep breeds  <cit> . a bighorn sheep linkage map could therefore be used to detect recent chromosomal rearrangements in sheep species and would help with inferring ancestral marker order for regions showing intra-specific variation.

while genome structure is anticipated to be similar between closely related sheep species, expectations for sex-averaged and sex-specific recombination rates are less clear. this is because domestication may have led to an increase in recombination rates and unusual male-biased heterochiasmy in domestic sheep  <cit> . however, the role of domestication in the evolution of mammalian recombination rates remains unclear due to the absence of data on wild relatives  <cit> . a bighorn sheep linkage map would enable such a comparison and help to determine if domestication played a role in the evolution of the atypical recombination patterns seen in domestic sheep.

in this article, we report on the development of a first-generation bighorn sheep genetic linkage map based on the genotyping of  <dig> polymorphic microsatellites in  <dig> animals from two pedigreed wild populations: national bison range , montana, usa  <cit> , and ram mountain , alberta, canada  <cit> . the availability of multiple mapping populations permitted a comparison of intra-specific variability in map characteristics as well as the construction of a more contiguous map that should in principle be more representative of the species as a whole. marker synteny and order were then compared between bighorn sheep and domestic sheep to test for recent chromosomal rearrangements. finally, we contrasted intervals between species in terms of sex-averaged length and sexual dimorphism to gain insights into the impacts of domestication on the evolution of mammalian recombination rates.

RESULTS
genotyping success and marker polymorphism
genotyping success was high  in both populations and is summarised in table  <dig> with additional details available in additional file 1: list of markers, map position and variability. marker diversity  and the number of informative meioses tended to be greater in the nbr population despite a smaller number of genotyped individuals.

population-specific maps
linkage analysis for population-specific datasets yielded very similar outcomes. for this reason, only salient features of these maps are presented here while specific details are made available in additional file  <dig> and additional file 2: comparison of bighorn sheep population-specific maps. in brief, all markers assigned to a linkage group  appeared to be part of the same chromosome in both populations. map contiguity was slightly greater in the nbr map, with  <dig> markers distributed along  <dig> lgs compared to  <dig> markers distributed along  <dig> lgs in the rm map. the nbr sex-averaged map spanned  <dig> cm while the rm sex-averaged map spanned  <dig>  cm. for both populations, while the overall female autosomal map was longer than the equivalent male map , two chromosomes  had longer male maps than female maps. in addition, nbr linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were longer in the male map while rm linkage groups 2a, 2b, 3c, 8a,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  16a,  <dig>  and  <dig> were longer in the male map.

the most likely marker order differed between maps in only one instance. this involved two tightly linked markers on chromosome  <dig>  for which order was reversed between maps. however, while support for the inferred order was moderate in the nbr map , support for the alternate order in the rm map was weak .

a comparison of the intervals present in both maps revealed that localized sex-averaged recombination rates were generally similar between populations . the sum of these intervals was accordingly similar . in both populations, intervals were more often longer in the female map than in the male map  but only significantly so in the nbr population . sexual dimorphism in interval length  was significantly more often in the same direction than not . however, interval-specific sdi was only weakly correlated between populations .

integrated bighorn sheep map
combining the two datasets in a single linkage analysis produced a highly contiguous map . in that analysis,  <dig> markers were assigned to  <dig> lgs representing all ovine autosomes and the x chromosome. since  <dig> markers were perfectly linked to another marker, the map only truly depicted the locations of  <dig> unique mapped positions for an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  loci per chromosome. sex-averaged intervals were on average  <dig>  ±  <dig>  cm long and usually shorter than  <dig> cm . the sex-limited and pseudo-autosomal regions of chromosome x were separated by slightly more than  <dig> cm in the sex-averaged map due to an absence of linkage in the male map but we decided to leave the lg intact due to evidence for tighter linkage  in the female map. oarfcb <dig> was excluded from chromosome  <dig> because it was estimated to be more than  <dig> cm away from its closest neighbouring marker . bms <dig>  bms <dig> and hbb2/ii could not be assigned to a chromosome while ghrhr was excluded due to having too few informative meioses. the length of the complete sex-averaged map was  <dig>  cm while the autosomal female and male maps were  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm long , respectively. intervals were significantly more often longer in the female map than in the male map , however four chromosomes  had longer male than female chromosome maps.

comparison of bighorn sheep and domestic sheep maps
synteny was highly similar between the bighorn sheep and the domestic sheep international mapping flock  maps with only three observed differences . first, fcb <dig> mapped to chromosome x in bighorn sheep but to chromosome  <dig> in domestic sheep. second, bm <dig> mapped to chromosome  <dig> in bighorn sheep but to chromosome  <dig> in domestic sheep. finally, neither of the two markers amplified in bighorn sheep with the primer pair used for mcma <dig> in domestic sheep mapped to the location of this marker predicted from the imf map . instead, mcma54/i and mcma54/ii mapped to bighorn sheep chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. for the three other primer pairs which amplified two unlinked markers in bighorn sheep , one of the markers mapped to its predicted position while the other mapped to a different chromosome . one additional putative difference between species was observed on chromosome  <dig> for markers not mapped in the imf but mapped in soay sheep, a feral domestic sheep breed  <cit> . the most likely order for this region in bighorn sheep was oarsej <dig>  oarsej <dig>  agla <dig> and oarsej <dig> versus agla <dig>  oarsej <dig>  oarsej <dig> and oarsej <dig> in soay sheep. the difference in log <dig> likelihood between marker orders in bighorn sheep was  <dig> .

the length of orthologous intervals was highly correlated between species  and their sum very similar . this excluded the intervals located at the tip of bighorn sheep chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  that have no equivalent in the imf map. intervals did not tend to be larger in one species than the other . based on coverage of these intervals in the version  <dig>  imf map, we estimated the current genome coverage by the integrated map in bighorn sheep to correspond to ~ 84% of the domestic sheep linkage map.

mean sdi in length  considering only orthologous intervals was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in bighorn sheep and - <dig>  ±  <dig>  in domestic sheep. the positive mean sdi in bighorn sheep reflected a tendency for larger intervals in the female map  while the negative mean sdi in domestic sheep indicated a tendency for larger intervals in the male map . interval-specific sdi was significantly correlated between species . the intercept and slope were both significantly positive . in general, sdi values in bighorn sheep tended to be greater than in domestic sheep .

discussion
as expected, marker synteny and order were generally congruent between bighorn sheep maps. this suggests that our dataset was mostly free of errors and justified combining individual maps. the nbr population was generally more informative than the rm population. this was likely a consequence of the more complete nbr pedigree combined with greater marker variability resulting from recent admixture  <cit> . nonetheless, information provided by both populations was generally complementary and ultimately allowed construction of a highly contiguous map covering approximately 84% of the species genome. this is greater coverage than for a similar map for free-ranging red deer  and almost on a par with one for soay sheep  for which virtually all genetic resources developed for domestic sheep can be used. the coverage of our map is therefore similar to a first-generation map for a domestic species and outstanding for a wild species.

recombination fractions were very similar between bighorn sheep populations. combining pedigrees into a single analysis therefore likely resulted in map distances that were generally representative of the species as a whole. while genuine intra-specific differences may exist in map distances, the integrated map is likely to more accurately depict recombination fractions of individual populations than the estimates derived from the population-specific maps. this is because interval estimates for population-specific maps were often based on relatively few informative meioses, especially in the rm population. relying on distances from the integrated map in future downstream population-specific studies is therefore advisable.

as predicted, marker synteny and order were generally congruent between the ovis species maps. this is in line with the expectation of  <dig> to  <dig> rearrangements per million years in most mammalian lineages  <cit> . however, it has to be acknowledged that marker coverage was generally too sparse to detect subtle rearrangements. cross-species comparison was also made difficult by the fact that some primer pairs amplified two loci. for example, bm <dig> mapped to different locations in each species but we are aware of a second locus for bm <dig> in bighorn sheep that could not be reliably genotyped. since primers for bm <dig> are also known to amplify multiple sets of bands in domestic sheep  <cit> , the bm <dig> loci mapped in the two species are probably not orthologous. similarly, fcb <dig> mapped to chromosome x in bighorn sheep but to chromosome  <dig> in domestic sheep. this marker is definitely autosomal in domestic sheep given that a fraction of males are undoubtedly heterozygous  so the discrepancy in map location is not spurious. however, fcb <dig> markers amplified in the two species might not be orthologous given that a single primer pair can amplify multiple markers. in contrast, convincing evidence for cross-species rearrangement came from the primers used to amplify mcma <dig> in domestic sheep. in that case, neither of the two markers amplified using this primer pair in bighorn sheep mapped to the location of the mcma <dig> locus in domestic sheep . the comparison of our map with the soay sheep map  <cit>  also suggested the presence of a minor rearrangement on chromosome  <dig>  while some of these cases may depict genuine rearrangements, it is clear from this study that the organization of the two species genomes is very similar.

genomic analysis in a close relative of domestic sheep offered the opportunity to infer ancestral marker order for chromosomal regions showing variation among domestic sheep breeds  <cit> . for chromosome  <dig>  the order of two loci located in the rearranged region  was similar between the nbr and the imf maps  <cit> . on the other hand, the most likely marker order in the rm map was similar to an alternate order documented in soay sheep  <cit> . inferred marker orders were arguably not significantly more likely than the alternate orders. yet, it is worth noting that this chromosomal region was the only one for which the most likely marker order differed between bighorn sheep maps. if both orders are present in bighorn sheep, it would mean that this region is either prone to rearrangements or that polymorphism in marker order originated millions of years ago rather than recently as hypothesised by mcrae and beraldi  <cit> . for a second putatively varying region located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , we only successfully amplified one  of the two markers used to infer rearrangement in domestic sheep . however, marker order in bighorn sheep for that region appeared to be the same as in the imf map based on a marker located only  <dig> cm away from tgla <dig> in domestic sheep . therefore, the imf appeared to portray the ancestral marker order.

the comparison of orthologous intervals suggested high similarity in localized sex-averaged recombination rates between the ovis species. while the near perfect concordance in total map length  may be coincidental, given that variation in the order of 10% has been documented among domestic sheep breeds  <cit> , it nonetheless strongly suggests little difference between species. assuming that results were not unduly biased by missing and erroneous genotypes , it appears that the elevated recombination rates observed in domestic sheep are a characteristic of ovis species rather than a consequence of domestication. alternatively, recombination rates may have increased rapidly in both species since their recent divergence as a consequence of domestication in domestic sheep and for a different reason in bighorn sheep. but, this later explanation seems unlikely since the evolution of mean recombination rates in mammals is generally slow and most likely governed by neutral processes  <cit> .

contrary to what has been found for domestic sheep, recombination rates in bighorn sheep tended to be greater in females than in males. the unusual pattern observed in domestic sheep therefore appeared to be species-specific. this finding is not overly surprising given the low phylogenetic inertia of the trait  <cit> . the magnitude of heterochiasmy in sheep species is also arguably modest when compared with species such as the saltwater crocodile  or the zebrafish . yet, the presence of male-biased recombination in domestic sheep remains puzzling given that recombination in placental mammals is generally female-biased  <cit> . an intuitive explanation is that altered sex-specific recombination patterns in domesticated mammals  might be an incidental result of strong artificial selection during the process of domestication. alternatively, the unusual heterochiasmy pattern documented in the domestic imf might simply be an artefact resulting from the facts that the population size was small, all sires descended from a single grand-sire and there were only three maternal grandsires compared to  <dig> granddams. knowing that recombination rates can vary substantially among individuals, and that such differences can have a large genetic component , it could be that the paternal grand-sire was characterised by an uncommonly high recombination rate breeding value and/or that some of the maternal grandsires were characterised by uncommonly small recombination rate breeding values . a comparison of sex-specific recombination rates in additional domestic sheep pedigrees might answer this question.

as in other taxa , great variability was observed in patterns of heterochiasmy across and along chromosomes. for example, recombination appeared to be male-biased for a few chromosomes despite the presence of a genome-wide tendency for greater recombination in females. however, no clear pattern emerged at the chromosomal level with the nbr and rm maps yielding mainly inconsistent results. at the interval scale, patterns of sexual dimorphism were conserved across populations and species. this means, for example, that genomic regions characterized by low sdi values in one species were mirrored by similarly low sdi values in the other species. this could be due to conserved sex-specific and/or sex-biased recombination hot-spots. however, fine-scale analyses of recombination rates in other pairs of closely related species  suggest that this is unlikely at the inter-specific level. inter-specific congruence in localized recombination rate sexual dimorphism could also be due to the position of intervals along chromosomes relative to centromeres and telomeres, irrespective of the exact location of individual hot-spots. for example, in humans, recombination tends to be greater in females near centromeres but greater in males near telomeres . in domestic sheep, recombination in telomeric and centromeric regions is usually greater in males . to verify if a similar pattern was also present in bighorn sheep, we contrasted bighorn sheep interval-specific sdi to the relative distance of these intervals from centromeres and telomeres inferred from the location of these intervals in the imf map. a pattern similar to that seen in domestic sheep was observed, with recombination being greater in males near centromeres and telomeres while being greater in females in more central parts of chromosomes .

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a first-generation bighorn sheep linkage map using dna from two wild pedigreed population and genomic resources originally developed for domestic sheep. since bighorn sheep and domestic sheep genomes are very similar, future efforts to increase marker density in specific chromosomal regions should be relatively straightforward. this could be achieved using bighorn sheep single nucleotide polymorphism  markers recently discovered using the ovinesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> , additional microsatellites already mapped in domestic sheep and/or by taking advantage of the recently acquired domestic sheep genome sequence  <cit>  to develop novel markers. the high similarity between the genomes of the two species should also greatly facilitate future efforts to assemble a bighorn sheep genome sequence and to develop additional snps.

the main reason for developing genomic resources in bighorn sheep is to allow studies of complex trait genetic architecture and evolution under natural settings. in the nbr population, genomic resources will enable investigations into the genetic basis of fitness, inbreeding depression and genetic rescue  <cit> . in rm, it will be possible to study the genetic architecture of additional traits including body mass, horn size and animal personality  <cit> . finally, genomic information could eventually be combined with population genetic approaches to study adaptive population differentiation  <cit> , especially in the context of parasitism  <cit>  and selective harvesting  <cit> .

while resources developed for domestic sheep are obviously highly useful to bighorn sheep research, genomic research in bighorn sheep can also yield valuable information through comparisons with domestic sheep in return. for example, we have demonstrated how linkage mapping in bighorn sheep can be used to infer ancestral marker order in domestic sheep. also, by comparing the domestic sheep map with the map of a close wild relative, we were able to determine that the elevated recombination rates observed in domestic sheep were likely a characteristic of ovis species while the unusual male-biased heterochiasmy might have been a consequence of domestication. finally, we have demonstrated that interval-specific patterns of sexual dimorphism could be conserved among closely related species, possibly due to the position of these intervals relative to centromeres and telomeres.
