BACKGROUND
yersinia enterocolitica species has six biotypes  of which five  contain pathogenic strains. y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica consists mainly of the strains of bt 1b, which are considered highly virulent. low-virulent ssp. palearctica encompasses bts 2– <dig> and 1a. since bt 1a strains lack most of the classical virulence markers, this biotype is often considered non-pathogenic. nevertheless, bt 1a strains are commonly isolated from patients with diarrhoea. reports supporting the pathogenicity of some bt 1a strains comprise clinical data
 <cit>  and cell experiments
 <cit> . a virulence marker commonly found in bt 1a strains is the gene ystb encoding heat-stable yersinia enterotoxin b whereas they usually lack the ysta gene found from y. enterocolitica 4/o: <dig> strains. yersinia enterotoxins a and b are homologues to enterotoxins found in enterotoxigenic e. coli  and vibrio cholerae non-o <dig> strains
 <cit> . higher rates of diarrhoea, weight loss, and death have been detected when young rabbits were infected with a y. enterocolitica strain that produces heat-stable enterotoxin compared to the infection with a knock-out mutant
 <cit> . a majority of the y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains possess the ystb gene
 <cit>  and some excrete heat-stable ystb enterotoxin at 37°c in experimental conditions corresponding to those found in ileum
 <cit> .

the bt 1a strains are genetically the most heterogeneous of all the y. enterocolitica biotypes
 <cit> . they belong to numerous serotypes, with at least  <dig> having been identified
 <cit> . it has been suggested that bt 1a should be separated into its own subspecies based on genetic differences on a dna microarray against y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica bt 1b strain 8081
 <cit> . likewise, a number of other studies utilizing different methods have suggested that y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains could be divided into two main clusters
 <cit> . however, since the studies have been conducted on different sets of strains, it is impossible to know whether all the methods would divide the strains into two clusters similarly. recently, two genome sequences of bt 1a strains with no evident structural differences were published
 <cit> . notable differences between an environmental serotype o: <dig> and a clinical bt 1a/o: <dig> strains were the presence of a rtx toxin-like gene cluster and remnants of a p2-like prophage in the clinical bt 1a/o: <dig> isolate
 <cit> .

bt 1a was the predominant biotype of y. enterocolitica detected among yersinia isolates from human clinical stool samples in finland in 2006
 <cit> , as also in other european countries
 <cit> . of the finnish patients with a bt 1a strain, 90% suffered from diarrhoea and abdominal pain, but only 35% had fever. furthermore, 3% of the patients had reactive arthritis compared to  <dig> % of the controls
 <cit> . we hypothesized that certain bt 1a strains might have a higher pathogenic potential than others. in order to study this, the clinical bt 1a isolates were investigated using multilocus sequence typing , 16s rrna sequencing, yst-pcr, lipopolysaccharide  analysis, sensitivity to five yersiniophages and serum killing assay. mlst results were analysed with baps  program, genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the bt 1a strains were compared and statistical analysis was applied to assess their correlation with the symptoms of the patients.

RESULTS
genetic population structure and phylogeny
in the mlst analysis, a subset of  <dig> y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains were discriminated into  <dig> mlst types and the  <dig> 4/o: <dig>  3/o: <dig> or 2/o: <dig> strains were discriminated into four different mlst types. the genetic diversity indexes for the genes used in mlst were  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . bayesian analysis of the mlst sequences divided the bt 1a strains into two distinct genetic clusters, which were clearly separated from the tight cluster formed by the strains of bt’s 2– <dig> and from the bt 1b strain  . one of the bt 1a clusters contained  <dig> bt 1a and two non-biotypeable strains and was designated as bt 1a genetic group  <dig>  another cluster contained five bt 1a strains and was designated as bt 1a genetic group  <dig>  ten bio/serotype 3-4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> strains clustered closely together, and the single bt 1b strain was located in the vicinity of this cluster. baps analysis did not indicate any significant level of mosaicism among the isolates, i.e. no isolates contained variation typical to more than one cluster.

when concatenated mlst sequences  were compared to each other, the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains were 95–96% similar to bt 1a genetic group  <dig>  bio/serotype 4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig>  as well as to y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica strains of biotype 1b . the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains were 97% similar to bio/serotype 4/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> and y. enterocolitica ssp. enterocolitica strains . a neighbour-joining tree depicting the relatedness of the selected yersinia strains and species based on the mlst sequence concatenates is shown in an additional file .

comparison of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences  revealed bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains to have over 99% similarity among themselves, 98–99% similarity to genetic group  <dig> strains and 98% similarity to y. enterocolitica bt 2-4/o: <dig> or o: <dig> strains . actually, the 16s rrna gene sequences of bt 1a genetic group  <dig> were more similar  to y. intermedia, y. mollaretii, y. aldovae and y. bercovieri than to bt 1a genetic group  <dig> . when the results obtained from representative subsets of  <dig> strains and analysed using 16s rrna gene sequencing and mlst were combined, two genetic groups were formed:  <dig> strains were in genetic group  <dig> and  <dig> in genetic group  <dig> 

of all the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains included in the mlst analysis, none were ysta positive in pcr, but 98% were ystb positive. all five of the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains were both ysta and ystb negative in pcr. the 4/o: <dig>  3/o: <dig> and 2/o: <dig> strains were all ysta positive and ystb negative in pcr. when also the bt 1a strains that were not included in the mlst analysis were tested for ysta and ystb,  <dig> further strains were found to be negative in ystb pcr. they were also subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing and were found to be part of bt 1a genetic group  <dig> .

phenotypic characteristics
based on the characteristics of the lipopolysaccrarides  in silver-stained doc-page gels, the  <dig> y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains were classified into four main lps types , with each containing several subtypes . the subtype characteristics are described in detail in an additional file . fourteen of the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains expressed homopolymeric o-ps subtype a <dig> lps, similar to lps of serotype o: <dig> . three of the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains had rough lps type. the strains of genetic group  <dig> and the non-typeable strains expressed a great variety of lps types and subtypes. all  <dig> y. enterocolitica 4/o: <dig> and 3/o: <dig> strains included in the lps analysis expressed homopolymeric subtype a <dig> o-ps and the five y. enterocolitica 2/o: <dig> strains subtype a <dig> o-ps . three of the ystb negative strains of bt 1a genetic group  <dig> belonged to lps group a <dig>  two to c <dig> and one to b1c.

c homopolymeric o-ps length estimated by migration in doc-page; heteropolymeric o-ps is described by x/y/z, where x = number of steps in o-ps ladder ; y = size of step ; z = average modality of steps; single length o-ps migrates as one band with estimated number of sugar residues.

d the biotype of the strains is 1a unless otherwise indicated. the presence of homopolymeric o-ps was visible as a smear above the short ladders and not always easy to distinguish in silver-stained doc-page gels.

phage sensitivity of the strains was tested using five yersinia specific bacteriophages . most of the  <dig> bio/serotype 3–4/o: <dig> strains were sensitive to ϕyeo3- <dig>  py <dig> and ϕr1-rt, in addition  <dig> strains were sensitive to ϕ80- <dig>  the single bio/serotype 2/o: <dig> strain was infected by ϕr1-rt only. the  <dig> bt 1a and non-biotypeable strains representing different lps-types showed variable phage sensitivity patterns further demonstrating the heterogeneity of this group of strains. however, all  <dig> of the bt 1a genetic subgroup  <dig> strains were resistant to all the tested phages.

resistance to human serum complement-mediated killing was most common  in the lps subtype a <dig> strains, which included the known pathogenic y. enterocolitica serotype o: <dig> strains . of the strains in the lps subtype c <dig>  which included the bt 1a/o: <dig> isolates, 87% were serum resistant. serum resistance was also high  among subtype c <dig> strains, which included bt 1a strains with similar lps-structure to reference strains of serotypes o: <dig>  o: <dig>  and o: <dig> . of the bt 1a lps subtype a <dig>  strains, 72% showed resistance to complement killing. however,  <dig> of the  <dig>  bt 1a genetic group  <dig> strains among the lps subtype a <dig> showed high resistance to complement killing. as a whole,  <dig> of the  <dig>  strains of the bt 1a genetic group  <dig> were resistant to serum complement killing . among the lps b-subtypes, which included a number of the bt1a genetic group <dig> isolates, complement resistance was rather low or non-existing .

the strains belong to biotype 1a and genetic group  <dig> unless otherwise indicated.

statistical analysis of patient symptoms
the symptoms  of patients with bt 1a did not differ significantly when the statistical analyses were based on the genetic grouping or serum resistance of the bt 1a isolates. the patients with isolates belonging to different lps-groups were symptomatic, but due to the small amount of patients in analyses, no significant statistical inference could be made.

discussion
the strains previously identified by phenotypic tests to belong to y. enterocolitica bt 1a
 <cit>  formed two phylogenetic clusters based on mlst analysis, genetic groups  <dig> and  <dig>  bt 1a genetic group  <dig> comprised of isolates with related 16s rrna gene sequences but with great variation in their pathogenicity-associated properties. on the contrary, bt 1a genetic group  <dig> was found to be rather uniform and phylogenetically distinct from the other y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains. the genetic similarity of this group to genetic group  <dig> was 95–96% based on the mlst sequences and 98–99% based on the 16s rrna gene sequences. all the  <dig> strains determined to belong to y. enterocolitica bt 1a genetic group  <dig> were ystb negative in pcr and were resistant to the five tested yersiniophages. additionally, none of them fermented fucose, as determined in our previous study
 <cit> . likewise, pathogenic pyv + yersinia strains do not ferment fucose, whilst 91% of the bt 1a strains other than those of genetic group  <dig> do. of the genetic group  <dig> strains 82% were resistant to serum complement killing and 76% belonged to lps type a <dig> 

remarkably, the 16s rrna sequences of bt 1a genetic group  <dig> were more similar to y. intermedia, y. mollaretii, y. aldovae and y. bercovieri than to y. enterocolitica 16s rrna sequences. however, a previous study indicated that the use of mlst of house-keeping genes determined genetic relatedness among yersiniae better than 16s rrna
 <cit> . studies using both dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequence data have illustrated that if two strains show less than 97% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, they are separate species
 <cit> . nevertheless, even 99% similarity of 16s rrna genes does not guarantee that bacterial strains represent the same species. howard and colleagues
 <cit>  have already suggested that bt 1a strains should be designated as a third subspecies of y. enterocolitica based on the comparison of whole genomes using dna microarray. it is likely that the genetic difference between the two phylogenetic groups of y. enterocolitica bt 1a discovered in the present study may also be high enough to justify designation of different subspecies or even species. although further analyses would be needed for species designation, our data add insight into the phylogeny of the genus yersinia, which is continuously evolving: three novel yersinia species, y. entomophaga, y. pekkanenii and y. nurmii were described as recently as 2010
 <cit> .

this is the first time that two phylogenetic clusters of y. enterocolitica bt 1a strains are reported based on the sequence analysis of house-keeping genes, but similar results indicating the existence of two main clusters of bt 1a strains have been obtained with other molecular methods, such as ribotyping and rep-eric
 <cit> , gyrb-rflp
 <cit> , afpl
 <cit> , mlee
 <cit>  and, most recently, maldi-tof mass spectrometry to identify the protein mass patterns
 <cit> . gulati and virdi
 <cit>  found in their study that sequences of gyrb genes of representative two clonal groups of bt 1a strains were only 97% similar. when we compared these gyrb sequences to our data, sequences dq <dig> and dq140397
 <cit>  were clustered with bt 1a genetic groups  <dig> and  <dig> of our study, respectively. this is further justification for the separation of bt 1a strains into two phylogenetic lineages. as in our study, the presence of ystb gene correlated with the clonal groups, except in one strain
 <cit> . the lack of the ystb gene in pcr test does not always correlate with the phylogenetic lineages, since our study also found six strains without the ystb gene in bt 1a genetic group  <dig>  however, only the use of hybridization analysis or sequencing would confirm the pcr results. in a recent study of the whole genome sequences no evident structural difference was found with ystb-positive bt 1a/o: <dig> and bt 1a/o: <dig> strains
 <cit> . therefore, it is likely that the two whole genome sequences represent one of the genetic groups of bt 1a of the present study. blast searches showed that the sequences we obtained for genetic group  <dig> were nearly identical with the ones from the above mentioned whole genome sequences, while for genetic group  <dig> no matching sequences were detected.

we used doc-page based classification of lps to subtype our y. enterocolitica strains. this method offered a practical substitute for o-serotyping, since there are no commercial o-specific antisera available for numerous y. enterocolitica serotypes. the results were consistent with earlier o-serotyping of the bt 1a strains using available commercial antisera
 <cit>  which demonstrated that  <dig> subtype c <dig> strains were of serotype o: <dig> and that  <dig> subtype b <dig> strains agglutinated with anti-o: <dig> antiserum indicating that they probably were of the common serotype o: <dig> . however, the strains with o: <dig> antigen, were found in lps subgroups b2c and b2d which indicates that the classification of subgroups of b <dig> was tentative and differences could also be inherent to the silver staining procedure. the clinical bt 1a strains showed a wide diversity in their lps types and this is most likely also reflected in their o-serotypes. the majority of the strains, 37%, had lps subtype c <dig> that is similar to that of serotypes o: <dig>  and o: <dig> , and 15% of the strains had subtype c <dig>  i.e., that of serotype o: <dig>  globally, the serotypes o: <dig> and o: <dig> have been the dominant serotypes of bt 1a associated with diarrhoea
 <cit> . in the present study the strains of lps subtype c <dig> and c <dig> as well as the strains of bt 1a genetic group  <dig>  demonstrated significant resistance to complement killing, which suggests that the strains of these subgroups may have more pathogenic potential than the other studied strains. bacterial pathogens have several strategies to resist host defence mechanisms, including resistance to the bactericidal activity of the human serum complement
 <cit> . pathogenic y. enterocolitica 4/o: <dig> strains are able to resist serum killing by yada- and ail-mediated binding of the serum complement regulatory proteins factor h and c <dig> binding protein
 <cit> . the bt 1a strains of the present study did not possess the yada gene and only one strain had the ail gene
 <cit> . thus the resistance to complement killing of these bt 1a strains must have another, unresolved mechanism.

although the potential pathogenicity of bt 1a strains remains controversial, there are a few studies that show an association to disease. for instance, bt 1a/o: <dig>  was associated with spondyloarthropaties of patients in england and south-wales
 <cit> . also, in a study of antibody production, it was found that a patient with symptoms of diarrhoea and reactive arthritis had igg, iga and igm antibodies against the bt 1a/o: <dig> strain isolated from her fecal sample
 <cit> . we found symptomatic patients with isolates of both bt 1a genetic groups, but did not find statistical differences between the genetic groups and the clinical picture of the symptoms of these patients. it may be that the patients’ genetic or other factors such as gut environment are relevant in the disease caused by bt 1a strains.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our study present strong evidence that strains classified as y. enterocolitica bt 1a represent more than one subspecies. bt 1a genetic group  <dig> consisted of strains with a variety of pathogenicity-related properties, whereas all  <dig> strains of bt 1a genetic group  <dig> lacked the ystb gene, belonged either to the same lps subtype or were rough, were all resistant to the five tested yersiniophages and were largely resistant to serum complement killing. furthermore, none of them fermented fucose. although several studies have been conducted to reveal the significance of the bt 1a strains in causing disease, indisputable results have not been obtained. this study shows, however, that bt 1a is a very heterogenous group of strains, some of which might be potential pathogens. therefore, better understanding of the genetic and phenotypic variability and clustering of these strains, as achieved in our study, would be crucial in determining the pathogenic role of the strains belonging to the defined clusters.
