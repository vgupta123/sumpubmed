BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is a progressive neurological disorder that is the most prevalent form of age-dependent dementia  <cit> . the neuropathological features of ad include amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, and selective neuronal loss. the principle constituent of amyloid deposits is a peptide denoted amyloid β, with the most abundant forms being  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues long and termed aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the endocytic pathway has been implicated in the secretion and production of aβ  <cit> . aβ is produced from sequential endoproteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein . first, β-secretase cleavage occurs in the acidic late endosomes  <cit>  and thereafter, γ-secretase cleavage liberates aβ40/ <dig> into the endosomal lumen  <cit> . the endosomal contents can be either secreted from the cell  <cit>  or transferred to the lysosome  <cit> . exposure of aβ to endosomal ph has been found to induce various changes in its conformational and oligomeric states  <cit> , with the formation of amyloid fibrils, and other oligomeric forms  <cit> .

there is growing evidence that aβ aggregation is the causal event in ad pathology. amyloid deposits of aβ found in the limbic and association cortices are surrounded by signs of neurodegeneration: dead or dying neurons, activated microglial cells, and reactive astrocytes  <cit> . in addition, aβ-induced neurotoxicity has been demonstrated in numerous cell culture studies  <cit> . moreover, transgenic mice expressing ad associated mutant human app develop neuropathological lesions similar to those of ad patients. immunization of these transgenic mice with aβ <dig> aggregates reverses much of the neuropathology  <cit> . a proposed hypothesis explaining this phenomenon is that the immune system acts as a peripheral sink that traps aβ and depletes it from the central nervous system  <cit> . these studies provide compelling evidence that extracellular aβ is a significant contributor to neurotoxicity in ad.

the cell surface represents the first site of interaction between extracellular aβ and neurons, and may be the location where the neurotoxic cascade is initiated. studies on the neurotoxicity of aβ indicate that aggregated aβ is generally more toxic than monomeric aβ  <cit> . given that the state of aggregation affects the neurotoxic properties of aβ, we have sought to determine whether the aggregation state also influences the interaction of aβ with the surface of neuronal cells. we demonstrate that the surfaces of neuronal cells possess protein-rich sites that bind aβ, and that aggregation competence is a critical requirement for cell surface binding.

RESULTS
aggregation propensity of aβ is unaffected by tmr labelling
the studies reported here make use of tetramethylrhodamine  labelled aβ , where the tmr group is located on the side chain of the n-terminal lysine. tmr was selected over other probes because it has been shown that tmr does not selectively partition into any particular subcellular organelle or microenvironment  <cit>  and its fluorescence properties are ideal for confocal microscopy  <cit> . furthermore, in a previous study, rhodamine  has been covalently attached to the n-terminus of aβ <dig> for thermodynamic solubility measurements, and the solubility behaviour of this labelled peptide was similar to that of unlabelled aβ <dig>  <cit> . we have also demonstrated that attaching a fluorescent label to the n-terminus of aβ via a flexible glycine linker does not alter its amyloidogenic properties  <cit> . we note that the n-terminus of aβ is more accessible and less involved in amyloidogenesis than other regions of the sequence  <cit> ; thus, fluorescent labelling of the n-terminus is likely to have the least influence on amyloidogenesis.

we performed several biochemical characterizations of the tmr-labelled peptides used in this study, and we found that the labelled and unlabelled peptides behaved similarly. we found that labelled versions of both aβ <dig>  and aβ <dig>  exhibited identical circular dichroism spectra to their unlabelled counterparts, all possessing a negative band at  <dig> nm, which is characteristic of β-structure. we also studied a double mutant  of aβ <dig> , which was discovered through a gfp-based screen for mutations that reduce the aggregation propensity of aβ <dig>  these two particular mutations were shown to transform the highly aggregation-prone aβ <dig> into a soluble unstructured monomeric peptide  <cit> . tmr-labelled mutant peptide was found to exhibit an unstructured conformation by circular dichroism , even after storage for sixty days at room temperature . we used thioflavin-t to assess the amyloidogenic potential of the peptides. thioflavin-t is a dye known to shift its fluorescence from  <dig> nm to  <dig> nm upon binding specifically to the cross-β-structure of amyloids but not to the monomeric or small oligomeric complexes  <cit> . using thioflavin-t fluorescence, we observed very similar ph-dependent fluorescent emissions for both labelled and unlabelled aβ <dig>  and aβ <dig> . interestingly, the mutant peptide did not exhibit significant thioflavin-t fluorescence enhancement . negative stain electron microscopy revealed that tmr-labelled aβ <dig>  and tmr-labelled aβ <dig>  could produce characteristic unbranched amyloid fibrils. in sum, these data demonstrate that tmr-labelling does not alter the amyloidogenic properties of these peptides.

aggregation propensity is varied amongst aβ isoforms
the aggregation propensities of aβ <dig>  aβ <dig>  and the mutant peptide have been recently investigated  <cit> . we compared the tmr-labelled versions of these peptides and found that they follow the same order of aggregation propensity: aβ <dig> > aβ <dig> > mutant peptide. dynamic light scattering was used to assess the degree of aggregation of the peptides after incubation for  <dig> minutes at room temperature, ph  <dig> . the mutant peptide did not oligomerize under these conditions, aβ <dig> formed a bimodal distribution of small and large oligomers with hydrodynamic radii of  <dig> and  <dig> nm, respectively, and aβ <dig> formed large oligomers with radii centered around  <dig> nm but extending to particles with radii of several hundred nm. thioflavin-t fluorescence was used to compare the extent of amyloidogenesis of these peptides at ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> . these ph values  were selected as they were found to induce the largest thioflavin-t fluorescence for aβ <dig>  and aβ <dig> . under these conditions, the order of thioflavin-t fluorescence was: aβ <dig> > aβ <dig> > mutant peptide. as previously mentioned, we did not observe significant thioflavin-t fluorescence over a wide ph range for the mutant peptide . the mutant peptide seemed aggregation incompetent under conditions that were conducive to forming amyloid fibres for aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  our experimental results indicate that the rank order of aggregation propensity of the tmr-labelled peptides is the same as their unlabelled counterparts.

drastic differences in cell surface associations between aβ isoforms
using confocal microscopy to image tmr-labelled aβ, we examined the association of the peptides to the surface of three model neuronal cell lines  and one non-neuronal cell line . interestingly, we observed a correlation between aggregation propensity and peptide deposition on all three neuronal cell lines . after incubating the cells with peptide for  <dig> hours, aβ <dig> was observed to associate strongly with all three differentiated neuronal cell lines in localized punctate regions. aβ <dig> was found to exhibit a similar punctate association, but to a lesser extent than aβ <dig>  the mutant peptide, which is aggregation incompetent, did not associate to the surface of any of the cell lines tested. the apparent lack of cell surface association by the mutant peptide clearly supports the idea that cell surface association requires a specific peptide conformation or sequence and argues against non-specific interactions brought about by the tmr group  <cit> .

the lack of aβ association to the human lymphoma cell line, u <dig>  is noteworthy. massiotti and perlmutter  <cit>  reported that u <dig> cells are resistant to aβ induced cell death. we have also found them to be resistant to aβ toxicity and incapable of binding aβ over all exposure times tested . to ensure that the lack of binding was not caused by degradation of aβ by u <dig> cells, aβ immunoblots were performed after exposure to u <dig> cells. the integrity of aβ was maintained after exposure to u <dig> cells .

aggregation propensity of aβ correlates with cell surface binding kinetics
having established an unambiguous link between peptide aggregation propensity and neuronal cell surface association, we investigated whether there is a similar correlation with cell surface binding kinetics. we treated ngf-differentiated pc <dig> cells with each peptide and monitored tmr fluorescence on live cells as a function of time by flow cytometry analysis. dead cells were readily distinguished from live cells by staining with 7-aad, a dna binding dye that is excluded by live cells with intact membranes  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the striking differences in the levels of tmr florescence on live pc <dig> cells within only one hour of peptide exposure. aβ <dig> clearly displayed the highest rate of cell surface association, followed by aβ <dig>  in contrast, the mutant peptide showed no apparent association with live cells.

averaging multiple flow cytometry analyses and normalizing to the percentage of live cells labelled with tmr, we were able to closely study the differences in cell association kinetics displayed by each peptide . aβ <dig> showed a fast binding phase  in which the peptide bound ~50% of the live cells present. this was followed by a slower binding phase that occurred over a 24-hour period. the fast binding phase was completely absent in the binding kinetics of aβ <dig>  however, other kinetic features of aβ <dig> binding were found to be similar to the slower binding phase of aβ <dig>  notably, the mutant showed no measurable interaction with live ngf differentiated pc <dig> cells . the rate of alzheimer amyloid peptides association with neuronal cells was directly related to their aggregation propensity, indicating that aggregation propensity is an essential determinant of both the rate and amount of cell surface association.

trypsin reduces cell surface binding of aβ42
to determine the molecular nature of the cell surface aβ binding sites, we examined whether the following reagents blocked aβ binding: concanavalin a, heparinase iii, annexin v, chondroitinase abc, cholera toxin subunit b, and trypsin . concanavalin a binds mannosyl and glucosyl residues  <cit> , it can be used to block the potential binding of aβ to these cell surface sugars. since heparin sulphate and chondroitin sulfate have been suggested as possible binding sites for aβ  <cit> , the ngf differentiated pc <dig> cells were treated with heparinase and chondroitinase  to remove these groups  <cit> . fluorescein-labelled annexin v was used to block potential aβ interactions with phospholipids. annexin v preferentially binds to phosphatidylserine  <cit> , however at high concentrations it non-specifically binds to any negatively charged phospholipids  <cit> . gm <dig> ganglioside has also been implicated as a potential aβ binding molecule  <cit> . fluorescein-labelled cholera toxin subunit b was used to block aβgm <dig> ganglioside interactions, as it is known to bind gm <dig> ganglioside and is used as a marker for lipid rafts  <cit> . all of the treatments mentioned above failed to block binding of aβ to the surface of live ngf differentiated pc <dig> cells , and co-staining of tmr and fluorescein signals was neither observed for annexin v nor cholera toxin subunit b in confocal and flow cytometry results . the only cellular treatment that was observed to significantly decrease aβ binding was trypsin digestion , indicating that the binding sites are likely membrane proteins. we performed experiments to rule out the possibility that the reduction in aβ <dig> binding is simply caused by degradation of aβ <dig> by trypsin; after each trypsin treatment, trypsin was inactivated with excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor  and the cells were washed thoroughly prior to adding tmr-labelled aβ <dig>  in addition, aβ immunoblot analysis of the cell extracts and conditioned media were performed after trypsin treatments. no proteolytic degradation of aβ was detected . trypsin treatment in the presence of sbti abrogated the effect of trypsin , thus the blockage of aβ binding is caused by the proteolytic activity of trypsin and not by some other process. cellular trypsin treatments were also observed to be concentration dependent , further supporting that trypsin treatment abolishes the cell surface binding of the peptide. interestingly, aβ binding was recoverable if the live trypsin-treated cells were allowed to sit for  <dig> –  <dig> hours in the absence of trypsin . this result suggests that after trypsin removal, continued protein synthesis replenished the aβ binding sites on the cell surface. collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that neuronal cell surface proteins play a critical role in the aβ binding process.

tmr-labelled aβ <dig> binds to unlabelled aβ <dig> aggregates on the cell surface
our demonstration that aggregation propensity is a prerequisite property for cell surface binding suggests that cell surface proteins bind aβ aggregates, and may serve as seeding sites that promote further aβ aggregation on the cell surface. to test this possibility, we treated ngf-differentiated pc <dig> cells with unlabelled aβ <dig> . to visualize the unlabelled aβ <dig> bound to the cell surface, the cells were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody  directed against the n-terminus of aβ. control experiments, in which 6e <dig> and secondary antibodies were applied to cells that were not treated with aβ <dig>  indicated that the antibodies do not bind nonspecifically to the cell surface . however, immunostaining of cells treated with unlabelled aβ <dig>  showed a punctate staining pattern that was similar to that observed in cells treated with tmr-labelled aβ <dig> . this similarity in staining patterns indicates that tmr-labelling of the peptide does not perturb the cell surface association. sequential treatment of the cells with unlabelled aβ <dig>  immunostaining with 6e <dig> antibody, and tmr-labelled aβ <dig> indicated co-localization of unlabelled aβ <dig> immunostaining with tmr fluorescence . this co-localization indicates that tmr-labelled aβ <dig> binds to unlabelled aβ <dig> aggregates on the cell surface. thus, aβ that is bound to the cell surface is capable of binding to other aβ molecules from the extracellular environment.

discussion
our investigation adapts a versatile imaging technique, and reveals a striking correlation between the aggregation propensity of alzheimer amyloid peptides and their cell surface association kinetics with neuronal cells. previous studies have shown that aβ <dig> has a higher propensity to aggregate  <cit>  and is the primary constituent in senile plaques  <cit> . however, the direct link between neuronal cell association and peptide aggregation propensity was unclear until now. aβ <dig> is the primary product of proteolytic cleavage from the amyloid precursor protein  <cit> . we found that aβ <dig> displays relatively slow association kinetics with neuronal cells  and would be more likely to be cleared in vivo, before initiating toxicity. on the other hand, aβ <dig> associates rapidly with neuronal cells  and is thus more capable of initiating neurotoxicity and plaque formation. these observations offer insight into the early mechanism of ad onset seen with familial mutations that lead to an increase in aβ <dig>  <cit> . since aβ <dig> associates with cells at such a rapid rate, this process may exceed the rate at which the aging macrophage machinery clears amyloid deposits, resulting in the senile plaque core found within the brain of alzheimer patients. the link between aggregation propensity and cell association becomes more evident with the double mutant of aβ <dig>  <cit> . this aggregation incompetent mutant peptide does not associate with the surface of any of the cell lines tested . this finding is evidence that cell surface association of aβrequires a specific peptide sequence, conformation and/or aggregation state. thus, aβ aggregation propensity plays a critical role in initiation of the amyloid cascade.

previous studies have used dyes, radioactive aβ, and antibodies to study the interactions of aβ with cell cultures  <cit> . our results  reveal similar punctate staining as imaged recently with antibodies directed specifically against oligomeric structural forms of aβ  <cit> . however, our technique allows images to be obtained with live cells throughout the progression of aβ aggregation, and through its multitude of intermediate states. the major drawbacks of endpoint antibody detection with fixed cells or limited detection of specific conformations of aβ are avoided by using our approach. this approach will be especially beneficial for developing therapeutic treatments that target specific conformations of aβ, as the global effect of aβ on the cell can be monitored.

the novel finding that u <dig> human lymphoma cells are resistant to cell surface binding by aβ offers an excellent control for future therapeutic testing. this cell line was known to be resistant to aβ toxicity  <cit> , but the present findings provide the first biochemical evidence that u <dig> cells are missing the critical cell surface constituents that are responsible for interaction with aβ and initiation of aβ deposition on the surface of neuronal cells  <cit> . the lack of aβ cell surface association was not caused by peptide degradation  over the course of the experiment but most likely resulted from the absence of particular cell surface proteins. thus, this cell line provides a useful negative control for the identification of these proteins.

our studies of aβ imaging in live cells has uncovered the major role of membrane proteins as binding sites of aβ40/ <dig> on the neuronal cell surface . these studies utilizing trypsin were carefully constructed to ensure that trypsin was completely inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor before peptide treatments were made. immunoblot analysis confirmed that the trypsin-induced reduction in aβ association was not caused by tryptic digestion of aβ, as lower molecular weight aβ derived peptides were not observed in the cell culture media or associated with the cell pellet fraction .

many cellular components have been implicated to interact with aβ  <cit> , several of which are proteins  <cit> . our results that aβ binds preferentially to neuronal cells but not the non-neuronal cell line u <dig>  indicates that the membrane protein binding sites are not present in this cell line. the membrane protein or proteins that bind aβ have to be identified; however, there still remains the possibility that some of the membrane protein binding sites maybe unrelated to the amyloid cascade.

CONCLUSIONS
our experimental system of observing interactions of fluorescently labelled aβ peptides with live neuronal cells provides a straightforward technique for evaluating potential therapeutic compounds for their ability to block interactions of aβ with cell surface proteins and prevent the neurotoxic cascade elicited by aβ. our study has also revealed some of the molecular details controlling the interactions of these peptides with neuronal cells; namely, that aggregation propensity is a critical determinant of cell surface binding.
