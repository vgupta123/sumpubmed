BACKGROUND
the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis  is chronic lung disease caused by a vicious cycle of infection and inflammation which leads to progressive deterioration of pulmonary function, respiratory failure, and death  <cit> . pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main bacteria associated with pulmonary disease in cf. in vivo and in vitro evidence suggests that p. aeruginosa produce biofilm within the airways of chronic cf pulmonary infection patients, <cit>  which is a protective barrier around the bacterial cells and limits exposure to oxidative radicals, antibiotics, and phagocytes  <cit> . bacterial biofilms play a relevant role in persistent infections, which are rarely eradicated with antimicrobial therapy  <cit> .

despite the evidence of p. aeruginosa grown in the airways of cf patients in biofilm form, the susceptibility profile of the bacterium is usually evaluated, in vitro, in the planktonic state. however, the planktonic susceptibility profile may not represent the actual susceptibility of the bacteria  <cit> . to overcome the potential shortfalls of traditional  microbiological methods to evaluate susceptibility, biofilm models have been proposed to access susceptibility of p. aeruginosa in vitro <cit> .

macrolide antibiotics are being evaluated for the treatment of chronic lung inflammatory diseases, including diffuse panbronchiolitis, cf, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. although macrolides have no antimicrobial activity against p. aeruginosa at therapeutic concentrations, there is great interest in the evaluation of treatments of cf patients with these antibiotics, at least as complementary therapy  <cit> . anti-inflammatory activity of macrolides has been showed in many studies, including clinical trials  <cit> . macrolides have also proved to present potential effects on inhibition of bacterial biofilm with reduction of bacterial virulence factor when used in sub-inhibitory concentrations  <cit> . in the present study, we evaluated the in vitro action of macrolides in combination with anti-pseudomonal agents on biofilm-grown p. aeruginosa recovered from cf patients.

RESULTS
the mic <dig> and mic <dig>  for the  <dig> isolates were as follows: ceftazidime   <dig> and 16; ciprofloxacin   <dig>  and 16; tobramycin   <dig> and 64; imipenem   <dig> and 16; meropenem   <dig>  and 4; respectively. bic <dig> and bic <dig>  for all isolates were as follows: caz  <dig> and 256; cip  <dig> and 64; tob  <dig> and 64; ipm  <dig> and 256; mem  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. there was a statistical significant difference between mic and bic values of isolates for all antibiotics tested .

detailed legend: caz - ceftazidime, cip - ciprofloxacin, tob - tobramycin, ipm - imipenem, mem - meropenem, p – statistical significance , mic – minimal inhibitory concentration, bic – biofilm inhibitory concentration.

the number of “non-susceptible”  isolates according to mic and bic for each antibiotic was as follows: caz 9/ <dig>  and 24/ <dig> ; cip 19/ <dig>  and 23/ <dig> ; tob 13/ <dig>  and 30/ <dig> ; ipm 15/ <dig>  and 44/ <dig> ; mem 6/ <dig>  and 18/ <dig> , respectively. there was a statistical significant difference between the susceptibility category of isolates for all antibiotics tested, except for cip .

the macrolide mic values were tested for all isolates. both azithromycin   and clarithromycin   presented a median mic of  <dig> mg/l. mic <dig> and mic <dig>  for all isolates were  <dig> and  <dig> for azm;  <dig> and  <dig> for clr, respectively.

the non-suscetible isolates according to bic results were included in the macrolide combination assay  with caz , cip , tob , ipm , and mem . when  <dig> mg/l of clr was associated with the anti-pseudomonal agents, the median bic values were significantly reduced for caz  and tob , but not for cip , ipm , and mem . at higher clr concentration , bic values significantly reduced when associated with caz , but not when associated with cip , tob , ipm , and mem . in the presence of  <dig> mg/l of azm in combination with the anti-pseudomonal agents, the median bic values were reduced significantly for caz , cip , and tob , but not when associated with ipm  and mem , while the presence of  <dig> mg/l of azm in association with all antibiotics showed reduction in median bic values for all antibiotics tested  .

clr at  <dig> mg/l presented strong inhibitory quotient  when associated with tob  and caz . clr at  <dig> mg/l presented strong iq when associated with caz . azm at  <dig> mg/l presented a strong iq when associated with caz , cip , and tob . moreover,  <dig> mg/l of azm in combination with all anti-pseudomonal agents tested presented the highest proportion of isolates with strong iq for all antibiotics tested: caz ; cip ; tob ; ipm ; and mem  .

a total of  <dig>  isolates presented the mucoid phenotype, but no statistical significant differences in the susceptibility profile of mucoid and non-mucoid isolates were found for the antibiotics tested in the different conditions performed in this study .

the repeatability of the assays demonstrated a coefficient of variation  of mic and bic for caz, cip, ipm, mem, and tob of  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. when macrolides were associated, the highest cv was  <dig> % for caz with  <dig> mg/l of clr and the lowest was 0% for tob with  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l of clr.

discussion
bacteria in biofilm are more prone to resist treatment with antibiotics and to evade the action of immune system cells. the present study observed a significant difference between mic in planktonic and in biofilm growth conditions. bic values were considerably higher than the conventional mic values for all anti-pseudomonal antibiotics tested in our study as also found by moskowitz and collaborators  <cit> . mem proved to be the most active antibiotic regardless the growth condition, caz proved to be the second most active antibiotic in planktonic conditions of growth, whereas cip was the second most active antibiotic in biofilm conditions. in vitro studies have indicated that cip is one of the most active agents against bacterial biofilm of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. this is possibly related to the fluoroquinolones ability to penetrate into biofilms killing non-growing bacteria  <cit> . as expected, all isolates were resistant to azm and clr.

the principal finding of our study was that non-susceptible p. aeruginosa exposed to macrolides at sub-inhibitory concentrations became susceptible to a variety of anti-pseudomonal agents  in biofilm conditions. it is of note that in many associations we found a strong iq between anti-pseudomonal agents and macrolides. the impact of tobramycin/clarithromycin and ceftazidime/clarithromycin co-administration on p. aeruginosa biofilms was also observed in studies of tré-hardy and collaborators  <cit> . other study showed that the biofilm was strongly affected by the presence of clarithromycin, and, in its presence, amikacin mic lower than those obtained in the absence of clarithromycin  <cit> .

in our study, co-administration of azm at  <dig> mg/l presented considerable impact when associated with all anti-pseudomonal agents tested  on p. aeruginosa biofilms from cf patients. although azm has no bactericidal effect on p. aeruginosa, it was shown that azm retards the formation of biofilms and blocks the bacterial quorum sensing involved in the production of biofilms  <cit> . the use of azm to treat chronic infections of p. aeruginosa in the lungs of cf patients has been gaining favour due to the improved outcome of cf patients treated with this antibiotic  <cit> .

synergistic and additive activities were noted when azm and clr were paired with conventional antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa strains in the study of saiman and collaborators. overall, combinations were more active against cf isolates than against non-cf isolates and more active against mucoid strains than against non-mucoid strains  <cit> . however, in our study no significant difference in the macrolides combination assay was observed when we compared mucoid with non-mucoid p. aeruginosa clinical isolates.

interpretative criteria of susceptibility are not standardized for the combination assay in biofilm conditions and this is the main limitation of our study. therefore, one must be aware that the biofilm susceptibility testing and the macrolide combination assay proposed in our study need further clinical validation for applying it in microbiology laboratories.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, p. aeruginosa clinical isolates from cf patients within biofilms are highly resistant to antibiotics and macrolides may be useful as adjunctive therapy as they proved to augment the in vitro activity of anti-pseudomonal agents.
