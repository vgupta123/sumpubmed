BACKGROUND
the study on the second generation bio-fuel, which can be constantly derived from the waste of agriculture and forestry and the widespread distribution of non-food plants, is a hot area of current research of renewable energy
 <cit> . among non-food plants, as the raw material of bio-fuel, miscanthus sinensis has been focused on in recent years as an ideal bio-source plant. this fiber-rich plant is widely distributed around south east asia, and it’s also a common specie in china
 <cit> . however, the complexity of lignocellulose of its cell wall makes the plant very difficult to be degraded
 <cit> . thus, it is urgent to explore new strong functional enzymes to solve the key problem in degradation of this plant, and to discover an economical way for the production of renewable bio-fuel from miscanthus sinensis.

the conversion of the most abundant part of fiber, cellulose, into bio-fuel will depend on the synergistical hydrolysis of enzymes at least including three main cellulases: endo-β- <dig> -glucanase , cellobiohydrolase  and β-glucosidase 
 <cit> . β-glucosidase is widely distributed in nature
 <cit> , which catalyses the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds existing in disaccharides, oligosaccharides and alkyl- or aryl- β-glucosides
 <cit> . although β-glucosidase does not act on cellulose directly, it is of great importance in cellulose deconstruction by eliminating cellobiose inhibition on endoglucanases and exoglucanases, allowing the cellulolytic enzymes to function more efficiently
 <cit> . therefore, the activity of β-glucosidase is considered as the rate-limiting factor in cellulose degradation.

the low efficiency of β-glucosidases discovered in previous studies may be responsible for the high cost of bio-fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass
 <cit> , identification of new efficient β-glucosidases is thus important and necessary. ruminants carry out a foregut fermentation that digests plant polysaccharides materials by a complicated and efficient microbial process
 <cit> . therefore, the habitat in rumen represents a rich hotspot for exploring diverse functional enzymes which could be used in lignocellulose degradation. considering the fact that more than 85% of ruminal microbes remains uncultured, metagenomic technology, avoiding from pure culture, has drawn more attention during the study of finding new cellulolytic enzymes from this special environment
 <cit> .

metagenomic strategy had been successfully employed in identification of new biocatalytic enzymes encoding genes from the uncultured component of microbial communities from a variety of environmental samples
 <cit> . in general, metagenomic method involves the extraction of metagenomic dna from uncultured samples, the construction of the metagenomic libraries and the screening for the aimed genes
 <cit> . this culture-independent method is able to avoid the limitation of the pure cultivation method, and many new β-glucosidases encoding genes have been obtained by means of metagenomics
.

it had been demonstrated that the ratio of cellolytic bacteria was increased in large intenstine of miscanthus sinensis feeding cattle
 <cit> . meanwhile, our unpublished result showed that the ratios of cellolytic bacteria and fungi in rumen were also increased due to the sole forage of miscanthus sinensis. therefore, exploring new cellolytic enzymes encoding gene from miscanthus sinensis feeding cattle exhibit more potentiality. the aim of the present study was to identify new gene encoding β-glucosidase from total dna isolated from ruminal microbes of xiangxi yellow cattle fed on miscanthus sinensis using the metagenomic techniques. through function-based screening of the metagenomic library, one new β-glucosidase gene was obtained. the recombinant enzyme was overexpressed in escherichia coli bl <dig> and investigated for the enzymatic properties.

RESULTS
construction and evaluation of the matagenomic library from microbes in xiangxi yellow cattle rumen
to identify new β-glucosidase from metagenomic library, the strategy was described in figure 
1a. rumen content samples were collected from xiangxi yellow cattle in hunan province. a fosmid library was constructed with metagenomic dna isolated from microbes of rumen samples, containing  <dig>  clones. the average insert size of clones was about 30 kb, and the full size of the library was estimated to be 600 mb . the stability of this metagenomic library was reliable according to the result of restriction endonuclease analysis that the insert fragments of three clones which were chosen randomly from the library were in accord with the original one after four times of subcultures . furthermore, the reliability of the present metagenomic library was also proved by the results of random sequencing of  <dig> clones’ insert fragments . one singlet of all had ≥97% similarity with bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and two singlets had ≥97% similarity with uncultured bacteria, which demonstrated the present metagenomic library was valid, while, other eighty-nine singlets didn’t have high homology with known sequences which perfectly confirmed that the library possessed great novelty .figure  <dig>

annotation of β-glucosidase gene unglu135b12
all of the clones were transferred to the screening plates for β-glucosidase activity. a clone expressing relatively strong β-glucosidase activity was obtained, named 135b <dig>  due to the average length of insert sequence of 135b <dig> was about 32 kb, sequence of the new gene encoding β-glucosidase was not fit for direct location. thus subclone library was further constructed using the puc <dig> vector to yield smaller fragments. after the screening by the same activity-based method as mentioned above, the positive subclone was sequenced. the length of predicted orf was 2340 bp encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids . the new sequence had been submitted to ncbi, and the genebank access number was jx <dig>  the sequence of 2340 bp was shortly named as unglu135b <dig>  and the encoded protein was unglu135b <dig> accordingly.figure  <dig>

analyses of predicted β-glucosidase sequence and domain structures
the theoretical molecular mass of unglu135b <dig> is  <dig>  kda, and the value of pi is  <dig>  according to the analysis of dnastar. sequence analysis with smart indicated that the putative protein has one glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> domain  and one glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> c terminal domain  . additionally, conserved domains search on ncbi also revealed that unglu135b <dig> comprised these two conserved domains . thus unglu135b <dig> was probably a gh <dig> β-glucosidase. information of phylogenetic tree showed it exhibited from 57% to 62% sequence identities to homologous proteins derived from bacteria of bacteroidetes phylum  .

expression and characterization of unglu135b12
in order to characterize unglu135b <dig>  unglu135b <dig> was cloned into pet28a  and heterologously expressed in bl <dig> and purified. the western bolt detection showed the positions of expressed protein and purified protein, which were in accordance with the predicted mw value . furthermore, the purified unglu135b <dig> was tested on the functional screening plate and it was demonstrated that the heterologous protein before/after purification and dialyzed protein were still with the β-glucosidase activity .figure  <dig>

to determine enzymatic characteristics of this purified putative gh <dig> β-glucosidase, pnpg was used as substrate for testing the activity of β-glucosidase. as shown in the present data, the optimal temperature was 38°c and the optical ph was  <dig>  , with the specific activity of  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/mg. the relative activity of unglu135b <dig> still reserved 60% when placed it under ph <dig> - <dig>  at 4°c for 24 h. the stability features of unglu135b <dig> were not very satisfied, as it was stable only in a narrow range of a battery of temperatures and phs .figure  <dig>

the addition of ca2+, k+, na+ slightly enhanced β-glucosidase activity of unglu135b <dig> by about 5% and about 10-85% loss of β-glucosidase activity was induced by addition of mn2+, fe3+, zn2+, cu2+. mg2+ had little effect on activity of unglu135b <dig> .

the activity of unglu135b <dig> towards pnpg was enhanced by glucose at concentrations lower than 40 mm . in the presence of 40 mm glucose, the activity of unglu135b <dig> increased to a maximum value with  <dig> % more than that of the control without glucose. with glucose further increasing, the enzyme activity was gradually inhibited.

the reaction kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme were measured from double reciprocal lineweaver-burk plots. this putative β-glucosidase had a km value of  <dig>  mmol/l, a vmax value  <dig>  μmol/min.

analysis of 3d structure and substrate docking
based on structural analysis, unglu135b <dig> was composed by three domains: an α/β barrel, an α/β sandwich and a fibronectin-like domain at carboxyl-terminal . it was supposed that α/β barrel and α/β sandwich were able to contribute each one of the two catalytic residues, while, the function of fibronectin-like domain was still unclearly and this domain was not present in all enzyme of gh <dig> family
 <cit> . molecular docking was conducted with the substrate pnpg by the tool of discovery studio libdock based on this lowest-energy model. in the light of the need of clearer description of the relative location between enzyme and substrate, then it was amplified appropriately as figure 
5b. moreover, figure 
5c indicated that some key residues existed around pnpg in the model, which could probably form hydrogen bonds and phosphoanhydride bonds and played irreplaceable roles in the catalytic pocket .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this present work, we used miscanthus sinensis, a promising cellulosic energy crop, as the plant substrate for feeding experimental animal. to explore new β-glucosidase gene from the microbial communities of these miscanthus sinensis fed cattle, a metagenomic library containing about  <dig>  clones was constructed, which was screened by function-based method. consequently, the gene unglu135b <dig> was identified as the potential candidate gene. the purified protein unglu135b <dig> showed high specific activity to the substrate pnpg, and its activity could be influenced by different irons. besides, the inhibition of glucose on unglu135b <dig> began to appear only when the concentration of glucose was more than 40 mm. these data provided strong evidence to support the feasibility of searching functional enzyme for mono-/polysaccharides degradation from rumen habitat. rumen habitats harbor a vast microbial diversity, including various anaerobic bacteria, archaea and fungi that are different from those found in water, soil or other environments. this special microbial community is closely related to the fiber-rich diet, due to the synergistic actions of cellulase, hemicellulase, ligninolytic enzymes and β-glucosidase derived from ruminal microbes, and fullfills the degradation of complex structure of plant in animal’s diet
 <cit> . therefore, the metagenomic library in our work distinguished itself as an ideal extensive resource for searching cellulolytic enzymes or other enzymes related to this degradation process.

on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, unglu135b <dig> was mostly closed to one beta-glucosidase from prevotella bergensis, belonging to bacteroidetes . this indication was in line with the results of our unpublished studies, in which we comparatively analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of ruminal bacteria between miscanthus sinensis fed cattle and mixed forage fed cattle and found that the proportion of bacteroidetes was increased significantly induced by the sole diet of miscanthus sinensis. so it emphasized again the relevance between feeding of miscanthus sinensis and rise trend of bacteroidetes in rumen. with the function of glycosyl hydrolase, bacteroidetes play key roles in the decomposition of carbohydrate polymers and proteins in digestive system of mammal
 <cit> . in the light of this point, it’s worthy to further detect new glycosyl hydrolase from the present microbial metagenomics library.

in addition, it was said that microbial genomes often contain a substantial number of glycosyl hydrolase  genes, many of which could be induced by different carbon sources. the evidence from conserved domain analysis strongly indicated that unglu135b <dig> was a member of glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> . gh <dig> is one of the largest gh families with more than  <dig> sequences in the cazy database  and the relative abundance and distribution of gh <dig> in the metagenome from the bovine rumen microbiome is  <dig> %
 <cit> .

after the western blot analysis using the specific anti-his tag antibody, the molecular mass of the rumen microbial protein was recognized as about  <dig> kd, in consistent with the predicted value, which suggested that this protein was probably a monomeric protein. moreover, the purified β-glucosidase unglu135b <dig> from the heterologous expression system were identified that it efficiently hydrolyzed pnpg within a narrow ph range of  <dig> - <dig> , and had optimal activity at 38°c, which indicated the native unglu135b <dig> protein might play an active role under in vivo conditions in the cattle rumen. however, these features of the recombinant protein might hinder its industrial application. given the limitation of unglu135b <dig> in industrial production, it’s worthy to improve its stability of ph and temperature by biotechnological methods such as site-directed mutagenesis, codon randomisation
 <cit>  or immobilization techniques
 <cit> . therefore, with the help of the prediction by homology modeling and molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis against the key residues could be considered as a new orientation in further research. while, the specific activity of unglu135b <dig> against pnpg was measured as  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/mg at ph  <dig>  when assayed at 38°c. it was considered as a relatively high value compared with other β-glucosidases found in uncultured microbes or pure-isolated microbes
 <cit> . besides, addition of ca2+, k+, na+ could enhance its activity to 105%. based on this information, it’s hopefully to achieve more enhancement of unglu135b12’s activity. furthermore, most of the microbial β-glucosidases reported to date are competitively inhibited by glucose, while several β-glucosidases from a few fungi and yeasts show high glucose tolerance
 <cit> . unglu135b <dig> is activated by glucose at concentrations below 40 mm and remains more than 75% activity with glucose at concentrations of 280 mm. in further study, the tolerance to glucose of unglu135b <dig> could be probably improved by protein engineering
 <cit> .

overall, the reason why unglu135b <dig> exhibited these characteristics described above could be attributed to its source. consistent with other β-glucosidases obtained by metagenome method from herbivore’s digestive tract, their optimal ph and temperature were in a narrow range which similar to their natural environment
 <cit> . in addition, it’s worth mentioning that the activity of unglu135b <dig> is significantly higher than that of the β-glucosidases from rabbit cecum
 <cit>  and yak rumen
 <cit> , moreover, the unglu135b <dig> still showed tolerance to glucose. these points might indicate more potentiality of further directed mutagenesis on unglu135b <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the more effective β-glucosidase could definitely convert cellobiose into glucose more conveniently and economically, and the combination of this new β-glucosidase and cellulase or hemicellulase will be beneficial for break the major bottleneck in industrial-scale conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels. furthermore, discovery of other high preformance new monofunctional enzyme or multifuctional enzyme from our library is hopefully believed to provide more possibility for their applications in future industrial production. besides, heterologously expressed functional enzyme by genetically modifying host organism could also be an effective tool in developing enzyme with desired properties.
