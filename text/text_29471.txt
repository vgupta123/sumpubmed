BACKGROUND
plants in order to cope-up with changing environmental conditions synthesize a wide variety of secondary metabolites, which not only acts as defence molecules but also contribute to its overall growth and development. biosynthesis of these compounds is often induced by various environmental stimuli and stress factors such as uv light or pathogen attack. catharanthus roseus  g. don, a tropical plant species, synthesizes more than  <dig> monoterpenoid indole alkaloids  as part of its secondary metabolism. some of the mias possess high therapeutic value such as antineoplastic drugs vinblastine and vincristine, so have earned a great commercial importance  <cit> . these mias are produced at very low levels via a complex mia biosynthetic pathway that is also reported to be stress induced in c. roseus. however, factors such as fungal elicitors, heavy metal ions, uv radiation, osmotic shock, wounding or pathogen attack induce their biosynthesis. treatment of c. roseus seedlings with methyl jasmonate  increases the activity levels of tdc , str , d4h  and dat  and leads to enhanced accumulation of vindoline  <cit> . moreover, elicitor induced ja biosynthesis and meja induced tdc and str are blocked by k-252a, a protein kinase inhibitor suggesting involvement of protein phosphorylation in this signal transduction  <cit> . to date there is no information regarding the involvement of any signaling component towards the accumulation of alkaloids in response to stress. one can speculate the involvement of mitogen activated protein kinase  cascade since wounding and systemin have been known to activate mapks upstream of octadecanoid pathway in tomato plants as well as autotrophic cell cultures  <cit> . in arabidopsis, regulation of camalexin biosynthesis by mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade has been reported  <cit>  map kinase is one of the major signaling cascades by which extracellular stimuli are transduced into intracellular responses  <cit> . mapk cascade includes three functionally linked kinases: map kinase ; mapk kinase  and mapkk kinase . upon elicitation by external stimuli, the receptors mediate the phosphorylation and activation of mapkkk. this activated mapkkk activates mapkk by phoshorylation at serine and threonine residues, which in turn activates mapk by phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues  <cit> . mapks are known to be activated by a variety of biotic and abiotic  <cit>  stresses in plants. in mammals and yeast, mapk cascades are active downstream to g-protein coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases  or two component histidine kinases. most of the mapk substrates include transcription factors, transcription regulators, splicing factors, receptors, histones and others  <cit> . the role of mapks has been implicated in various biological phenomena in plants including pathogen defense, abiotic stresses, cytokinesis and cell differentiation, and plant hormone signaling  <cit> .

in the present study we report cloning of a mitogen activated protein kinase from c. roseus, crmpk <dig>  the transcript and activity of crmpk <dig> is induced by the same stimuli known to induce alkaloid biosynthesis in c. roseus. further, transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> in c. roesus leaves results in up-regulation of specific alkaloids and the transcripts of genes involved in mia biosynthesis pathway. we infer that crmpk <dig> may have its role in stress-mediated accumulation of mia in c. roseus.

RESULTS
methyl jasmonate, uv and wounding activate map kinases in c. roseus
map kinase cascade is known to regulate several stress responsive biological processes in different plants. in order to understand the signaling component of mia biosynthesis we checked activation of mapk in conditions that lead to accumulation of mias. in c. roseus methyl jasmonate treatment  <cit>  and stress conditions such as uv  <cit>  and wounding  <cit>  have been shown to enhance alkaloid accumulation. we therefore, used these three conditions to study mapk activity in c. roseus leaves. equal amounts of protein extracted from the treated leaf tissue were analyzed in an in-gel kinase assay using myelin basic protein  as an artificial substrate. as shown in figure  <dig>  a transient activation of two different map kinases were observed within  <dig> minutes of wounding that decreased gradually. uv treatment also leads to increase in kinase activity within  <dig> minutes of treatment. at least three mbp phosphorylating kinases were observed after uv exposure whereas methyl jasmonate led to activation of single mapk . 

cloning of crmpk3
having seen the activation of mapk in different stress conditions we attempted cloning map kinase gene from c. roseus that might be regulating mia pathway. for the purpose, a cdna library of c. roseus in λzap ii was screened by a 438 bp mapk est . the sequencing of positive plaques obtained after tertiary screening gave a 630 bp fragment that showed maximum identity with wound induced protein kinase  from nicotiana attenuata . however, the identified clone was a partial gene with missing 5′ end. to get full-length mapk gene, a forward degenerate oligonucleotide was designed from 5' end of several mapk sequences from other plant species that showed significantly high identity with the 630 bp fragment obtained from library screening. the reverse primer was designed from the 3′ end of the identified partial mapk clone. pcr amplification of c. roseus cdna with 5′ degenerate and 3′ gene specific primers resulted in an amplicon of about  <dig>  kb. the cloning and sequence analysis of the amplicon led to identification of an orf of 1119 bp long encoding distinct c. roseus mapk. since the identified mapk gene shows maximum identity with tobacco wipk and arabidopsis atmpk <dig>  we named it as crmpk <dig> . phylogenetic analysis of crmpk <dig>  indicated that it belongs to group a mapks  <cit>  that are involved in signaling pathogen infections and abiotic stresses. analysis of deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the crmpk <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids and the protein contains all the  <dig> subdomains  that are conserved among all mapk families  <cit> . the ‘tey’ phosphorylation motif is found between vii and viii subdomains of crmpk <dig>  in silico analysis of the sequence revealed an approximate molecular weight of 43 kda. 

recombinant crmpk <dig> is an active mapk
to demonstrate that crmpk <dig> encodes a functional mapk, its complete orf was cloned into pgex-4-t <dig> vector and transformed into protease deficient strain of e. coli bl <dig>  the bacterially expressed glutathione s-transferase :crmpk <dig> fusion protein was affinity purified and used in an in-solution kinase assay alone as well as with myelin basic protein  as substrate. the recombinant protein showed auto-phosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of mbp  suggesting that crmpk <dig> encodes an active map kinase. kinase inactive form of crmpk <dig> generated by mutating lysine  at 69th amino acid residue to arginine  in atp binding site, crmpk3k69r failed either to auto phosphorylate or to phosphorylate mbp . the crmpk <dig> activity was further analyzed in an in-gel kinase assay with decreasing amount of recombinant protein in factor of  <dig> using mbp as substrate. as expected, the activity of purified fusion protein decreased with decrease in kinase concentration . the inactive form, crmpk3k69r showed no activity in in-gel kinase assay .

crmpk <dig> moves to nucleus upon wounding
to understand the fate of crmpk <dig> in planta, subcellular localization of crmpk <dig> was checked. for this, reading frame of crmpk <dig> was fused in frame with that of green fluorescent protein  in pcambia  <dig> vector. agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv <dig> transformed with this construct was used to transiently transform c. roseus leaf discs and viewed under confocal microscope after three days of incubation. crmpk <dig> was found localized mostly inside the cell along plasma membrane and cytoplasm . plasmolysis of the cells using mannitol have confirmed the fusion protein to be localized in plasma membrane and cytoplasm . however, when the leaf tissue was wounded by cutting into smaller pieces and viewed under microscope after 5 min of wounding, there appeared a shift in gfp fluorescence dispersed mostly in cytoplasm . when the same slide was observed after ten minutes, most of the fluorescence was found localized to nucleus . positions of the nucleus in slide are shown by dapi staining which coincides to that of crmpk <dig> nuclear signal . however, neither the crmpk3k69r-gfp nor gfp alone showed wounding induced migration to nucleus . this indicates that only the active crmpk <dig> migrates to nuclei upon activation by wounding. this finding is consistent with earlier reports of translocation of mapk from cytoplasm to nucleus in response to external stimuli  <cit> . 

crmpk <dig> shows wounding, uv and meja inducible expression and activity
since tobacco wipk and arabidopsis mpk <dig>  the close orthologs of crmpk <dig> exhibit increase in both enzymatic activity and mrna levels in response to various stimuli  <cit>  we investigated whether crmpk <dig> gene is also induced by stress conditions that enhance mia accumulation. two-months-old in vitro grown c. roseus plants were subjected to different stress conditions like wounding and uv treatment as well as methyl jasmonate treatment. the transcript level of crmpk <dig> in response to these stresses was analyzed by northern blot analysis. a significant increase in the level of crmpk <dig> transcript was noted within  <dig> minutes of these treatments . in case of wounding and meja treatments, the transcript level started to decline after 30 min of treatment. however, under uv treatment higher level of the crmpk <dig> transcript could be observed up to  <dig> hours post treatment before declining back to the basal level. 

to check whether stress inducible transcript accumulation of crmpk <dig> corroborates with its activity in planta, an immunoblot assay was performed using anti-crmpk <dig> antibody. leaves were subjected to wounding, uv stress treatment and methyl jasmonate application, the protein extracts prepared  <dig> minutes post treatments were immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4 g <dig>  the immunoprecipitates were subjected to western blot analysis with anti-crmpk <dig> antibody. a distinct activation of 43 kda map kinase is recognized by anti-crmpk <dig> antibody in wounding, uv and meja treated tissues compared with control/mock treated sample .

since crmpk <dig> and atmpk <dig> show high sequence similarity, the commercially available atmpk <dig> antibody  were used to assess activity of crmpk <dig> in response to the stress conditions mentioned above in c. roseus leaves. the immunoprecipitation with the dually phosphorylated active form of the mapk erk <dig>  antibody and immunoblot with αatmpk <dig> showed the near similar results as were seen with crmpk <dig> antibody . additionally, when immunoblot was perforemed using αcrmpk <dig> against total protein extracts of atmpk <dig> mutnat line and wild type plants , the signals could be observed only in wild type plants  validating the specificity of αcrmpk <dig> antibody.

transcript up regulation and protein activation of crmpk <dig> by wounding, uv treatment and methyl jasmonate prompted us to study key mia pathway genes regulation by these stresses. c. roseus leaf tissue subjected to wounding, uv treatment and methyl jasmonate application was harvested at different time intervals post treatment. rna was extracted from these tissues and quantitative-real time-pcr  was carried out for different genes of mia pathway. the mia genes analyzed were str , d4h , dat  and tdc   <cit> . as shown in figure 5c, all the treatments resulted in increase in expression of all the four mia pathway genes. however only a slight increase in expression of str is observed upon uv treatment.

transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> in c. roseus leaves increases mia pathway gene expression and alkaloid accumulation
the mrna expression pattern of crmpk <dig> and key mia pathway genes has shown a distinct co-regulation in response to different stress treatments. to draw a causal relationship between crmpk <dig> and mia pathway genes and specific alkaloids, transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> and its kinase inactive version crmpk3k69r in c. roseus leaves were used. first we confirmed the presence of transgene in transiently transformed c. roseus leaves using genomic dna pcr . expression analysis showed enhanced level of crmpk <dig> expression in crmpk <dig>  crmpk3k69r transformed leaves than that of control leaves  . we then checked the expression of mia pathway genes  and positive regulators orca <dig>  and repressors zct <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  in the same samples using qrt-pcr analysis. the result obtained revealed a distinct up-regulation in the expression of tdc, str, d4h, dat and orca <dig> and down regulation of zct <dig>  zct <dig> and zct <dig> in crmpk <dig> but not in crmpk3k69r transformed leaves  compared to the empty vector transformed control leaves. in case of crmpk3k69r transformed leaves, inspite of high level of crmpk <dig> mrna transcripts almost on par with crmpk <dig>  there were no major changes in transcripts level of mia biosynthetic pathway genes . the data obtained indicated that crmpk <dig> is involved directly or indirectly in the up-regulation of mia pathway genes and probably in more accumulation of the mias.

to get further insight into the role of crmpk <dig> in stress regulated mia accumulation we quantified some of the specific alkaloids in the transiently transformed c. roseus leaves. at least 8– <dig> leaves were used to quantify the alkaloids in both empty vector control and crmpk <dig> transformed leaves. the estimation was carried out  <dig> hours post vacuum infiltration. interestingly, the accumulation of serpentine, vincristine, vindoline and catharanthine were found to be more in the crmpk <dig> transformed leaves . this result further supported the role of crmpk <dig> in accumulation of mias.

discussion
catharanthus roseus is one of the most pharmaceutically important plant and several efforts have been made to increase the alkaloid content of the plant. some of them include, use of stress treatments such as wounding, uv treatment, heavy metal elicitation or elicitation by fungal cell wall components or treatment with hormones such as methyl jasmonate. these treatments lead to the increase in expression of mia pathway genes and accumulation of alkaloids in higher amounts. ja responsive str and tdc expression is sensitive to protein kinase inhibitors  <cit>  suggesting that phosphorylation plays a key role in the activation of mia pathway genes. map kinases, being the important class of protein kinases involved in signal transduction are operative during biotic or abiotic stresses; its involvement in the elicitor mediated signal transduction leading to higher accumulation of alkaloids cannot be overruled. in this study, we report the isolation of a full-length mitogen activated protein kinase from c. roseus, crmpk <dig>  the deduced amino acid sequence showed 86% identity with wipk from nicotiana benthamiana and lempk <dig> from lycopersicon esculentum, 84% identity with atmpk <dig> and 78% identity with osmpk <dig>  amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of  <dig> subdomains and a tey motif between vii and viii subdomains, typical of a map kinase. further, in solution kinase assay of the gst-tagged crmpk <dig> confirmed it to be an active map kinase.

regulations of map kinases have been observed both at transcriptional level as well as posttranslational level  <cit> . our findings with crmpk <dig> have shown similar results. enhanced transcript accumulation of crmpk <dig> was observed in response to wounding, uv exposure and meja treatments. the stress inducible expression of crmpk <dig> is in agreement with its orthologs in arabidopsis  and other plants where rapid expression was observed for mpk <dig> in response to stress  <cit> . further in tomato, uv b specific activation of lempk <dig> has been reported  <cit> . it is important to note that crmpk <dig> showed high homology with lempk <dig>  these studies indicate conserved biological function of the close orthologs.

further, wounding, uv and meja activated map kinases could be immunoprecipitated with 4 g <dig>  a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody  <cit>  and identified with crmpk <dig> antibody in an immunoblot analysis. the results confirmed that crmpk <dig> is activated by wounding, uv and meja treatment. interestingly, an activation of a putative mapk has been shown in response to uv in c. roseus cell suspension culture   <cit> . the uv-b responsive putative mapk activity was found to play significant roles in stimulation of tdc and str genes and accumulation of catharanthine in response to uv. however, this specific mapk has not been identified and gene encoding the same has not been cloned. nevertheless, the mapk activity shown earlier  <cit>  is unlikely to be of crmpk <dig> since its activity is observed at around 49 kda where as that of crmpk <dig> is of 43 kda. intriguingly our in gel kinase assay showed activation of more than one mapk in response to uv. it is important to note that the study  <cit>  has been conducted using c. roseus cell suspension culture  which lack cellular differentiation and provide an entirely different environmental conditions than naturally grown plants. cellular differentiation has been considered one of the important factors for expression of genes of mia and its accumulations  <cit> . the difference in activation of distinct mapks could be attributed to the different type of biological systems used for these studies. in agreement with this, distinct results with regard to csc and mature plants have been observed in rice  <cit> .

map kinase translocation into nucleus upon their activation is reported in many studies. the nuclear translocation of erm  kinase in parsley within  <dig> minutes in response to elicitor treatment has been reported  <cit> . the nuclear translocation of crmpk <dig> in response to wounding in c. roseus is in agreement with earlier report  <cit> . map kinases are widely speculated to directly or indirectly interact with transcription factors in the nucleus for gene regulation. the transfer of activated map kinase upon wounding to nucleus in the present study supports the function of mapks.

since biosynthesis of mias is responsive to environmental signals, transcript accumulation of a few mia pathway genes in response to wounding, uv treatment and methyl jasmonate application was studied. a distinct regulation of the mia pathway genes was observed at transcript level. since crmpk <dig> transcript also showed regulation in response to these treatments, it was thought worthwhile to study the effect of transient over-expression of crmpk <dig> on mia pathway genes. c. roseus leaves were transiently transformed with crmpk <dig> binary construct by vacuum infiltration method and transiently transformed leaves were studied for the expression of mia pathway genes. an increase in crmpk <dig> activity was observed in the transiently transformed leaves. the transient transformed leaves also showed a distinct up-regulation in transcription of tdcdat and d4h. transcript regulation of the positive and negative regulators of mia pathway genes was also studied. interestingly, orca <dig>  a positive regulator of the pathway showed up-regulation, while zct1zct <dig> and zct <dig> the repressors of mia pathway  <cit> , showed down regulation. zcts are members of zinc finger type transcription factor family and are known repressor of mia biosynthesis pathway genes  <cit> . orca <dig> is a member of ap <dig> transcription factor and are known positive regulator of mia pathway genes  <cit> . moreover, the increased transcripts of mia genes also resulted in higher accumulation of specific alkaloids in transformed leaf samples. a positive correlation has been reported between up-regulation of dat and d4h transcripts and accumulation of related mias in c. roseus <cit> . the up-regulation in the transcript level of tdc, str, dat and d4h can be partly explained by upregulation of the positive regulator and down-regulation of the repressors. the enhanced transcripts level of key genes of mia as well as increased accumulation of the specific alkaloids in transiently transformed leaves suggest a positive effect of crmpk <dig> on mia biosynthesis. role of the members of mapks in regulating defence compounds such as phytoalexins have been well documented in arabidopsis and rice. in arabidopsis mpk <dig> and mpk <dig> have been shown to regulate multiple genes in ethylene and camalexin biosynthesis  <cit> . similarly in rice mkk4-mpk3/mpk <dig> cascade regulate expression of several genes of phytoalexin biosynthesis and accumulation of phytoalexins in response to mamp  <cit> .

our present study reports, a map kinase from a medicinally important, c. roseus and its involvement, directly or indirectly in regulating the synthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. based on these findings it appears that crmpk <dig> could be a potential candidate that can be engineered for better production of specific alkaloid in c. roseus.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, cloning of the first mapk, crmpk <dig> from medicinally important plant catharanthus roseus has been reported. the crmpk <dig> encodes an active map kinase with  <dig> amino acids and molecular weight ~43 kda. in-silico analysis of amino acid sequence of crmpk <dig> shows that it possesses all the basic features of map kinase with ‘tey’ phosphorylation motif. phylogenetic analysis of crmpk <dig> with closely related mapks suggests that it belongs to group a mapk  <cit>  as it shows high sequence identity with tobacco wipk and arabidopsis atmpk <dig>  interestingly, crmpk <dig> shows uv, wounding and meja inducible expression pattern that is in harmony with the expression pattern of many of the key genes and regulators of mia biosynthetic pathway and mia accumulations   <cit> . enhanced expression of crmpk <dig> in the above conditions also reflected in its increased kinase activity in all studied conditions. role of crmpk <dig> in wounding is further substantiated with wounding induced nuclear localization of crmpk3-gfp, which is otherwise localized in cytoplasm . further concordance of crmpk <dig> and mias comes from the transient expression of crmpk <dig> in c. roseus leaves, which not only resulted in increased expression of master regulator, orca <dig> and key genes of mia pathway but also more accumulation of important alkaloids such as serpentine, vindoline, vincristine and catharanthine . from these studies we infer that crmpk <dig> may form an important component of signal transduction pathway leading to stress induced accumulation of mias in c. roseus. future studies with stable transgenics of crmpk <dig> and identification of interacting partner of crmpk <dig> in the form of the already identified mia pathway regulators could shed more light on signal transduction network. nonetheless, the present work is a miniature step towards unraveling the complex signal transduction mechanism in this model medicinal plant.
