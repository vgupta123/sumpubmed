BACKGROUND
filamentous fungi produce unique proteins called hydrophobins that are secreted and cover the walls of spores and hyphae with a hydrophobic layer  <cit> . structurally, hydrophobins are characterised by their small size and the presence of eight cysteine residues which are arranged in a conserved array and form four pairs of disulphide bridges. by their ability to aggregate to amphipathic membranes, they attach to the surface of the hydrophilic fungal cell wall, thereby exposing the hydrophobic layer to the outside  <cit> . by scanning electron microscopy, hydrophobin layers can often be recognised by the formation of rodlets of characteristic dimensions  <cit> . hydrophobin aggregates are highly resistant against treatments that are used for solubilising proteins. based on their amino acid sequences, hydropathy profiles and solvent solubility, two classes of hydrophobins are distinguished. while class i hydrophobin aggregates are extremely stable, and can be dissociated only in trifluoroacetic acid and formic acid, class ii hydrophobin aggregates can be solubilised in hot sodium dodecyl sulphate  or 60% ethanol  <cit> .

hydrophobins have been shown to serve several basic functions in fungi. by covering hyphal walls with a hydrophobic surface layer, they allow hyphae to escape from aqueous substrates and to develop aerial mycelia  <cit> . similarly, conidia are often covered with rodlet layers, which facilitate their dispersal by air or water droplets. loss of the hydrophobin layers by targeted mutagenesis of hydrophobin genes can lead to drastic reduction in surface hydrophobicity, resulting in 'easily wettable' phenotypes  <cit> . in the rice pathogen magnaporthe oryzae mutants in the class i hydrophobin mpg <dig> produced easily wettable conidia and hyphae lacking rodlets, and were defective in appressorium formation and host infection. this was attributed to the inability of the germ tubes to firmly attach to the hydrophobic plant cuticle and to appropriately sense surface features leading to appressorium differentiation  <cit> . in the same fungus, the class ii hydrophobin mhp <dig> was also found to be involved in hyphal surface hydrophobicity and for pathogenesis  <cit> . the tree pathogen ophiostoma ulmi produces cerato-ulmin, a class ii hydrophobin which is a wilt-inducing toxin. regarding its role in pathogenesis, a final conclusion has not yet been reached. while toxin-deficient mutants were not affected in pathogenicity, their phenotypes indicated that it contributes to the fitness of the spores of o. ulmi  <cit> . similarly, hydrophobin mutations in the tomato pathogen cladosporium fulvum did not impair the mutant strains to cause disease  <cit> .

botrytis cinerea  is a necrotrophic plant pathogenic ascomycete with a wide host range, including economically important fruits, vegetables and ornamental flowers. after colonisation of the host tissue, the fungus forms aerial mycelia that produce large numbers of conidia, which are the main source of new infections. due to their surface hydrophobicity, conidia adhere easily to the plant surface  <cit> . this initial adhesion is relatively weak and followed by stronger attachment immediately after emergence of the germ tube  <cit> . germ tubes secrete an ensheathing film that appears to mediate adhesion to hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates. the biochemical composition of the film has been analysed, and was found to consist mainly of carbohydrates and proteins, plus minor amounts of lipids  <cit> . germination of b. cinerea conidia has been found to depend both on the availability of nutrients and on physical surface properties. in solutions containing sugars as sole organic nutrients, efficient germination occurs only on a hard surface. in the absence of nutrients, germination can still be induced on hard, hydrophobic surfaces  <cit> . induction of germination by hard hydrophobic surfaces has also been described for conidia of other plant pathogenic fungi, namely colletotrichum graminicola and phyllosticta ampelicida  <cit> . these data indicate that the hydrophobic surface properties of conidia are a prerequisite for appropriate surface sensing under nutrient-limiting conditions.

in order to test the role of hydrophobins in conidial and hyphal hydrophobicity, and therefore possibly in hydrophobic surface sensing, we performed a systematic search for the presence of hydrophobin genes in the b. cinerea genome, analysed their expression, and performed a functional analysis of three hydrophobin genes and a hydrophobin-like gene. surprisingly, mutants lacking all these genes were found to be phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type in all parameters tested. our results challenge the concept that hydrophobins are generally required for the formation of hydrophobic surface layers in conidia and hyphae of higher fungi.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of botrytis cinerea hydrophobin genes
in the b. cinerea strain b <dig>  genome sequence, three hydrophobin encoding genes were identified. using magnaporthe oryzae class i hydrophobin mpg <dig>  <cit>  as a query in a blastp search, a protein  with weak homology was detected. its size, arrangement of the eight conserved cysteines, and overall hydropathicity was similar to m. oryzae mpg <dig> and other class i hydrophobins, and it was called bhp <dig> . using m. oryzae class ii hydrophobin mhp <dig>  <cit>  in another blastp query, the b. cinerea proteins bc1g_ <dig>  and bc1g_ <dig>  were found to show significant homologies . with blastp and tblastn searches using known hydrophobin proteins, no further hydrophobin genes were identified in the b. cinerea genome. the identification of hydrophobin encoding genes in fungal genomes is sometimes difficult due to their small size, the variable spacing between the cysteine encoding codons, and their low sequence homologies, in particular among class i hydrophobin genes. in order to identify further candidates for b. cinerea hydrophobins, a systematic search was performed in the published genome sequences of b. cinerea strains b <dig>  and t <dig>  the following search parameters were used: a) total size of the protein smaller than  <dig> amino acids; b) presence of at least  <dig> cysteines, four of them in a tandem arrangement separated by two further cysteine residues -cc--c--c--cc--c); c) prediction of a signal peptide. the search resulted in the identification of six further hydrophobin-like b. cinerea proteins, which all had a small size , and a similar pattern of eight cysteines after manual correction of annotations . examination of their hydropathicity revealed that five of these proteins are significantly less hydrophobic within the cysteine-rich region when compared to confirmed class i and ii hydrophobins . only the protein encoded by bc1g_ <dig> , showed a hydrophobicity similar to bhp <dig>  however, the cysteine spacing of bhl <dig> differs somewhat from that of confirmed class i hydrophobins  <cit>  , it has a distinct hydropathy profile , and it lacks homology to other fungal hydrophobins .

for the three hydrophobins bhp <dig> , bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> , and for six hydrophobin-like proteins, the cysteine spacing is shown. consensus cysteine spacings for class i and class ii proteins were taken from  <cit> . the sizes  of the unprocessed and processed proteins are indicated. n: n-terminus; xn: undefined number of amino acids; underlined: strictly conserved spacing; gravy: grand average of hydropathicity of the region covering the eight cysteines. positive gravy values indicate hydrophobicity  <cit> .

bhp <dig> is  <dig> amino acids long and contains eight cysteines with spacing as described for the class i hydrophobin consensus sequence  <cit> . it shows 30% identity to xph <dig> of the lichen fungus xanthoria parietina, and 29% identity to mpg <dig> of magnaporthe oryzae . the hydropathy plot of bhp <dig> shows similarity to that of mpg <dig> and of other class i hydrophobins . bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> are both  <dig> amino acids long and 27% identical to each other. both proteins match the consensus cysteine spacing of class ii hydrophobins   <cit> . bhp <dig> shares 37%, and bhp <dig> 29% identity with m. oryzae mhp <dig> . the hydropathy plots of bhp <dig> and mhp <dig> are similar .

comparison of hydrophobin genes in b. cinerea and sclerotinia sclerotiorum
a comparison of the genes that are encoding hydrophobins and hydrophobin-like proteins in the genomes of b. cinerea and the closely related s. sclerotiorum was performed . for all except one  of the b. cinerea proteins, apparent orthologues were found in s. sclerotiorum. the proteins encoded by bc1g_ <dig> and ss1g_ <dig> are bidirectional best hits in blastp queries; however their overall sequence similarity  is rather low.

expression of hydrophobin and hydrophobin-like genes during b. cinerea development
to analyse the expression profiles of bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig>  and the six hydrophobin-like genes, rna from different developmental stages of b. cinerea was isolated and analysed by reverse transcription-pcr. as shown in figure 2a, transcripts of bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig>  as well as the ef1Î± gene which was used as positive control, could be detected in mycelia, infected tomato leaves  <dig> h.p.i. and mature sclerotia of the wild type strain b <dig> , as well as in fruiting bodies from the cross of two b. cinerea field isolates. except for bhp <dig>  expression of all these genes was also visible in the conidial state. generally, expression levels of the three hydrophobin genes appeared to be rather low. transcripts of the hydrophobin-like genes bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig> and bc1g_ <dig> were also detected in all developmental stages tested, but with apparently variable expression levels. in contrast, expression of bc1g_ <dig> was largely restricted to sclerotia, and bhl <dig> transcripts were only observed in fruiting bodies. to estimate the expression levels of the genes more precisely, quantitative rt-pcr was performed . for each of the genes, expression in conidia was compared to that in the stage that appeared to show strongest expression. expression of all genes in conidia was rather weak. highest levels of expression were observed for bhp <dig> and bhl <dig> in fruiting bodies, in particular bhp <dig> reached expression levels similar to actin and ef1Î±. the increased expression of bhp <dig>  bc1g_ <dig> and bc1g_ <dig> in sclerotia was also confirmed.

targeted deletion of bhp <dig>  bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhl1
to analyse their functions, the hydrophobin genes bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> were consecutively deleted. hydrophobin single knock-out mutants were constructed by using hygromycin or nourseothricin cassettes for selection. for double knock-out mutants, both cassettes were sequentially used. finally, for generating a triple knock-out mutant, a Îbhp3/bhp <dig> double mutant was transformed with a bhp <dig> knock-out construct carrying a phleomycin resistance cassette as a third selectable marker. additionally, a knock-out mutant of the hydrophobin-like gene bhl <dig> was created. all transformants were verified by pcr analysis , and by rt-pcr using cdna from different developmental stages . no transcripts of bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> could be detected in the hydrophobin triple mutant in any of the growth stages tested. in the same way, no transcripts of genes that had been deleted could be amplified from hydrophobin double knock-out strains . the expression levels of the five hydrophobin-like genes bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig> and bc1g_ <dig> in the hydrophobin triple mutant appeared to be similar to the wild type, as far as this could be estimated from semi-quantitative rt-pcr. because transcripts of bhl <dig> could be unambiguously detected only in fruiting bodies , which were unavailable from Îbhl <dig> mutants, verification of the Îbhl <dig> strain by rt-pcr analysis was not possible.

growth, differentiation and infection behaviour of the hydrophobin mutants
the germination rates of hydrophobin knock-out mutants and the wild type strain were analysed under different conditions. as previously shown  <cit> , wild type conidia incubated on glass without nutrients did not germinate to a significant extent, whereas nearly complete germination occurred in the presence of  <dig> mm fructose. on a hydrophobic polypropylene surface, conidia germinated to 90%. neither the single nor the double nor the triple hydrophobin mutants showed any difference in their germination behaviour when compared to the wild type . to test the viability of the conidia under long term storage conditions, they were incubated for up to  <dig> weeks at 20Â°c and 32% humidity in the dark. samples were taken at regular intervals, and tested for germination of the conidia in full medium. no significant decrease in germination rates were observed for any of the mutant strains within this time period , indicating that hydrophobin mutants of b. cinerea do not display obvious defects in conidial viability.

the mutants Îbhp <dig>  Îbhp3/bhp <dig> and Îbhp3/bhp <dig>  were also tested in a radial growth assay on tma and gamborg glucose agar, in the presence of high temperature stress , and under salt stress . again, no differences in growth rates of hydrophobin mutants and the wild type strain were observed .

in verticillium dahliae, the class ii hydrophobin vdhi has been described to be required for microsclerotia formation  <cit> . the increased expression of bhp <dig> in sclerotia indicated that it could play a role in sclerotia formation or function. to induce sclerotia formation in the wild type strain and the hydrophobin mutants, conidial suspensions were inoculated on gamborg glucose agar and incubated for  <dig> days in the dark. as shown for the hydrophobin triple mutant in figure 3b, all of the hydrophobin mutants produced sclerotia in similar size and number as the wild type. when water droplets were applied to wild type and mutant sclerotia, they remained on the surface, indicating a hydrophobic nature of the sclerotial surface . the functional integrity of the sclerotia in the triple mutant and the Îbhl <dig> mutant was confirmed by a germination test . furthermore, microconidia and microconidia-forming structures were observed in close proximity to sclerotia in the wild type and in the mutants .

Împg <dig> mutants of m. oryzae are strongly impaired in their virulence on rice plants  <cit> . the b. cinerea hydrophobin mutants were therefore tested for host plant invasion and infection abilities. on onion epidermis cell layers, wild type strain b <dig>  usually forms short germ tubes before penetrating into the epidermal layer. the hydrophobin mutants analysed in this test penetrated into epidermis cells with the same efficiency as the wild type . for plant infection tests, one Îbhp <dig>  one Îbhp <dig>  one Îbhp <dig>  three Îbhl <dig>  three double and three transformants of the triple knock-out mutant were used to inoculate detached tomato leaves. no significant differences in the kinetics of lesion development and expansion were observed between any of the mutants and the wild type . similar infection tests performed with gerbera and rose petals also did not reveal any phenotypic differences between the strains .

surface properties of conidia of hydrophobin mutants are indistinguishable from the wild type
in many fungi, deletion mutants lacking individual hydrophobins, especially of class i, show 'easily wettable' phenotypes, due to the reduction in surface hydrophobicity of mycelia and conidia. to test the b. cinerea hydrophobin mutants for a similar phenotype, they were inoculated onto rich nutrient media and grown for  <dig> days to obtain densely sporulating mycelium. droplets of water and sds solutions at different concentrations were carefully overlaid and incubated for up to  <dig> hours at 20Â°c in a humid chamber. as illustrated in figure 3h, all of the droplets remained on the surface of sporulating mycelia of the wild type and the mutants. even after  <dig> hours of incubation at high humidity, the droplets were still present, except that the droplets with  <dig>   <dig> and 18% sds had partially sunken into the mycelia. similarly, wettability tests performed on aerial hyphae of non-sporulating mycelia revealed no significant differences between the wild type and a hydrophobin triple mutant: both strains were wetted by  <dig> % sds within a few minutes, while droplets of water remained on the mycelial surface for up to  <dig> hours .

conidia and hyphae of several fungi have been shown to be coated with hydrophobin layers that form typical rodlet-shaped crystalline structures. these layers are often absent in hydrophobin class i mutants  <cit> . previous electron microscopy studies of b. cinerea conidia did not reveal evidence for rodlet-like surface structures  <cit> . to examine whether or not conidia of b. cinerea hydrophobin mutants were affected in surface morphology, scanning electron microscopy  with dryly harvested spores was performed. neither the hydrophobin triple knock-out mutants nor the wild type conidia were covered with rodlet-shaped structures, and no differences were observed between the strains . when wild type conidia were treated with hexane, only small changes in their surface structures were observed. similarly, spores washed for several times with water left the conidial surface structures rather intact. in contrast, chloroform treatment had a drastic effect on the appearance of the conidial surface, leading to almost complete abrasion of the spinose surface .

discussion
the genomes of filamentous basidiomycetes and ascomycetes generally contain multiple hydrophobin genes  <cit> . in contrast, hydrophobin genes have not been found in yeasts, for example cryptococcus neoformans, saccharomyces cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, and candida albicans. despite their important role, hydrophobins are not the only proteins that confer hydrophobic properties to fungal cell walls. the basidiomycete ustilago maydis encodes a single hydrophobin, hum <dig>  and a much larger protein called rep <dig>  while hum <dig> plays only a minor role, the peptides released from rep <dig> during secretion are mainly responsible for conferring surface hydrophobicity to aerial hyphae in this fungus  <cit> .

our search in the annotated genome sequences of b. cinerea strains b <dig>  and t <dig> has revealed the presence of three unambiguous hydrophobins, and a total of six hydrophobin-like proteins, according to the criteria defined in the results. for all except one of these genes, homologues in the closely related sclerotinia sclerotiorum have been identified. in contrast, homologues in other fungi were only found for the three hydrophobins and for the hydrophobin-like protein bc1g_ <dig>  bc1g_ <dig> was unusual because its size , the dense spacing of the  <dig> consensus cysteines, and the presence of  <dig> additional n-terminal cysteines. the three hydrophobins share typical properties of class i  and class ii  proteins. expression of bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> was found to be low in conidia and mycelium. this was confirmed by a qrt-pcr analysis that showed generally low expression levels of the three hydrophobin genes and the hydrophobin-like genes in conidia. however, bhp <dig> was found to be strongly upregulated in fruiting bodies. this is supported by est data from a cdna library from apothecia of b. cinerea. among  <dig> ests,  <dig>  were found to represent bhp <dig> mrna, while no ests of other hydrophobin sequences were identified in the apothecial library . our rt-pcr data did not provide evidence that deletion of the hydrophobin genes significantly changes the expression level of any other hydrophobin  genes analysed in this study .

several of the hydrophobin  protein encoding genes showed their highest expression levels either in sclerotia  or in fruiting bodies . while we did not find any effects of the Îbhp <dig> mutants on sclerotia formation, the role of bc1g_ <dig> for sclerotia remains to be determined. since we have not yet been able to perform crosses with b. cinerea in our laboratory, the role of bhp <dig> and bhl <dig> in fruiting body development and function also remains to be clarified. the strong upregulation of bhp <dig> and the apparently exclusive expression of bhl <dig> in fruiting bodies suggest that these genes might play a role during sexual development.

using three different resistance markers for selection, mutants that lacked one, two, and all three hydrophobin genes bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhp <dig> were generated. to our knowledge, this is the first triple knock-out mutant described for b. cinerea. it was difficult to isolate because phleomycin is less suited for transformant selection compared to the commonly used hygromycin and nourseothricin, because of the growth of many false transformants. in addition to the hydrophobins, the hydrophobin-like gene bhl <dig> was knocked out. the resulting mutants were analysed for a variety of parameters of growth, differentiation and plant infection. in no case, significant differences between the phenotypes of wild type and mutant strains were observed. specifically, the mutants showed wild type-like surface hydrophobicity of conidia and hyphae, and normal conidial surface structures when viewed by scanning electron microscopy. in agreement with a previous study  <cit> , there is no evidence for the presence of a rodlet-like surface layer on b. cinerea conidia. this finding is in contrast to a variety of other fungi which have hydrophobin-coated cell walls surrounding conidia, germ tubes or aerial hyphae  <cit> . interestingly, hydrophobin layers have been recently found to protect conidia from immune recognition  <cit> . while airborne conidia of botrytis are usually less prevalent compared to the major genera cladosporium and alternaria, they have significant allergenic potential  <cit> . it is possible that this might be due to the absence of hydrophobin layers in b. cinerea conidia.

our data indicate that b. cinerea hydrophobins do not play a major role in the hydrophobic coating of spores and hyphal wall, and thus are not important for attachment to hydrophobic surfaces or formation of aerial hyphae. although we cannot completely exclude that any of the other five hydrophobin-like proteins listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> are relevant in this respect, they are more hydrophilic than bhp <dig>  bhp <dig>  bhp <dig> and bhl <dig> and therefore not very likely to represent hydrophobins. as mentioned before, we do not exclude the possibility that bhp <dig> or bhl <dig> are involved in sexual development. hydrophobins are known to be important for the formation of fruiting bodies in basidiomycetous mushrooms such as agaricus bisporus and schizophyllum commune  <cit> . in the chestnut blight fungus cryphonectria parasitica, the class ii hydrophobin cryparin has been shown to cover the walls of fruiting bodies and to be required for normal fruiting body development  <cit> .

because several hydrophobins are encoded in the genomes of filamentous fungi, it is difficult to fully assess their roles and to exclude complimentary functions. in the tomato pathogen cladosporium fulvum, six hydrophobins have been identified. using single mutations, one of them  was found to be required for spore surface hydrophobicity, another one  seems to be involved in adhesion of germinating spores to glass surfaces  <cit> . an attempt to assess the function of all hydrophobins simultaneously by multiple rnai silencing failed to result in complete knock-down of the genes  <cit> . in fusarium verticillioides, five hydrophobin genes  have been identified up to now in the genome. phenotypical analysis of single mutants in these genes and of a hyd1/hyd <dig> double mutant revealed that hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> are required for normal microconidia formation, but did not provide evidence for a role of these hydrophobins in growth, infection behaviour, and mycelium hydrophobicity  <cit> . this indicates that in some fungi, including b. cinerea and f. verticillioides, hydrophobins play only a minor - if any - role in generating cell wall surface hydrophobicity. however, they might serve other, as yet unknown functions.

by far not all fungal spores contain superficial rodlet layers. for example, they are missing in the urediospores of rust fungi  <cit> , and conidia of several powdery mildews  <cit> . rust urediospores have been shown to be covered with a layer of lipids that can be extracted with organic solvents, leading to a significantly decreased hydrophobicity, and increased attachment to hydrophilic surfaces  <cit> . surface bound lipids, containing hydrocarbon and fatty acid constituents, have been described for spores of several but not all fungal species analysed. the lack of visible effects of hexane treatment on the surface structure of b. cinerea conidia indicates that simple lipids are not a major surface component of these spores. alternatively, proteins other than hydrophobins could play a role in conferring surface hydrophobicity. in stagonospora nodorum, preformed surface glycoproteins have been proposed to play a role in the attachment of conidia to hydrophobic surfaces  <cit> . in the yeasts s. cerevisiae and c. glabrata, cell wall surface proteins called flocculins and adhesins, are involved in adhesion to various surfaces and in biofilm formation; their expression has also been correlated with an increased hydrophobicity of the cell surfaces  <cit> . adhesin-like proteins are also encoded in the genomes of filamentous ascomycetes; however, their function remains to be analysed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hydrophobins are very important for growth and differentiation of higher filamentous fungi, but their roles differ between different species. in some fungi, including b. cinerea, hydrophobic surface properties appear to be provided by as yet unknown mechanisms, different from the amphipathic layers formed by hydrophobins. it is evident that our knowledge about the molecules that cover the surfaces of fungal spores and determine their physicochemical properties is still far from being complete.
