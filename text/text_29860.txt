BACKGROUND
ketamine is a dissociative anaesthetic that causes profound analgesia and amnesia. recently, there has been growing interest in the reported antidepressant effects of ketamine. due to the almost immediate onset of antidepressant effects ketamine could potentially be particularly useful in acute treatment of depression  <cit> . this rapid-onset antidepressant action provides a novel potential approach for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder . however, clinical application of ketamine is limited by its psychotomimetic effects and rewarding properties, which are responsible for its recreational use and abuse  <cit> .

ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the nmda glutamate receptor, with affinities for other receptors and transporters, including dopamine d <dig> and opioid receptors as well as monoamine transporters . the complex pharmacological profile of ketamine makes it difficult to postulate a specific mechanism of its rapid antidepressant effect. the comparison with other nmda receptor antagonists does not provide clear indication of the possible mechanism of action  <cit> . phencyclidine  induces cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions but, unlike ketamine, was not observed to have antidepressant effects in humans. memantine, a drug with moderate-affinity for nmda receptors and without the adverse effects, also does not show evidence of rapid antidepressant effects in depressed patients  <cit> . thus, the antidepressant effects are specific to ketamine and result from unique combination of its receptor targets and triggered neuronal mechanisms. elucidating the mechanism of ketamine action would provide an important insight into the molecular correlates underlying the efficacy of rapid antidepressants and also suggest a useful approach for screening of novel compounds.

ketamine facilitates neuronal plasticity in brain areas implicated in mdd, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. it has been shown that ketamine enhances mammalian target of rapamycin  and increases expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor , resulting in modification to the number and function of synaptic connections  <cit> . these alterations are related to activation of downstream intracellular signaling pathways and transcription of genes  <cit> . therefore, the analysis of transcriptional programs associated with rapid action of ketamine may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying specific behavioral effects of this drug.

in this study, we used gene expression profiling to compare ketamine with pcp and memantine based on their transcriptional effects in the striatum and hippocampus. furthermore, we have analyzed the molecular profile of the selected nmda antagonists in comparison to over a dozen of antidepressants, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, anxiolytics and opioids  <cit> . our results identify differences as well as similarities between gene expression alterations induced by ketamine and other psychotropic drugs that may explain the unique psychoactive properties of ketamine and its rapid antidepressant effects. this study provides also a molecular classification of ketamine among psychotropic drugs based on the whole-transcriptome expression profile.

RESULTS
time-course of gene expression alterations induced by the selected nmda receptor ligands
first, we have analyzed alterations in the gene expression profile in the striatum and hippocampus following single administration of ketamine, memantine or pcp. the analysis of alterations in mrna abundance levels was performed using whole-genome illumina wg- <dig> microarrays at four time points . array data were subjected to three-way analysis of variance  with drug, time and tissue as factors . we found  <dig> drug-responsive transcripts  at the threshold of 1 % fdr  with fold change greater than  <dig>  . we found moderately higher transcriptional effects of memantine treatment comparing to ketamine and pcp . at the same statistical threshold of 1 % fdr,  <dig> transcripts with differential expression for the time factor  and  <dig>  transcripts for the tissue factor  were identified. the results for the time factor  indicated genes altered during the diurnal cycle such as e.g. dbp, ciart and per <dig>  the observed distinction between basal gene expression profiles in the striatum and the hippocampus was in line with expectations. the largest number of differences in gene expression was observed in case of neuron-type specific markers e.g. pdyn, rgs <dig> and tac <dig> fig.  <dig> gene expression alterations induced by nmda receptor antagonists in mouse hippocampus and striatum. microarray results are shown as a heat map and include genes with a genome-wide significance from three-way anova for the drug factor . colored rectangles represent transcript abundance  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 8 h after injection of the drug indicated above - ketamine , memantine  and pcp. intensity of the color is proportional to the standardized values  from each microarray, as displayed on the bar below the heat map image. hierarchical clustering was performed using euclidean distance. major clusters of drug-responsive genes are arbitrarily described as ‘c1’, ‘c2’ and ‘c3’. the over-representation of the pathways was found statistically significant with *p <  <dig> . genes involved in the indicated pathways, but displaying different transcription patterns were marked with grey color



hierarchical clustering and functional enrichment analysis of drug-responsive genes
hierarchical clustering revealed three clusters of drug-regulated genes . gene clusters c <dig> and c <dig> consisted of transcripts with increased mrna abundance levels in response to drug treatment . cluster c <dig> was induced 1 h after injection of ketamine and pcp and  <dig> to 2 h after injection of memantine. cluster c <dig> was induced  <dig> to 4 h by the three selected drugs to different degrees. example genes from each cluster include: dusp <dig>  per <dig>  sgk <dig>  and fkbp <dig>  slc2a <dig>  map3k <dig> . cluster c <dig> includes two down-regulated genes fgf <dig> and hes <dig>  in addition, functional enrichment analysis was used to investigate cell signaling pathways related to drug-induced gene expression patterns . enrichr, a gene signature search tool based on the wikipathways database, indicated overrepresentation of genes involved in mapk  and il- <dig>  signaling pathways among c <dig> gene cluster. furthermore, the enrichment analysis found genes from c <dig> cluster to be involved in insulin signaling .

the comparison of transcriptional effects in the striatum and hippocampus
the overall differences in drug-induced gene expression between striatum and hippocampus were compared using two-way anova for drug and time factors performed separately in each tissue. we found  <dig> transcripts regulated by drug treatment in the hippocampus and  <dig> transcripts altered in the striatum . the examples of regulated genes are dbp and mat2a in the hippocampus, and fgf <dig> and scrt <dig> in the striatum. we found  <dig> of the genes to be regulated in both the analyzed tissues, including dusp <dig>  sgk <dig> and sult1a <dig> . the pattern of gene expression alterations over time was similar for all the selected nmda antagonists . in the hippocampus the most substantial increase in mrna abundance levels was observed 1 h following the administration of ketamine, 2 h after memantine and  <dig> to 4 h after pcp. the strongest response to each drug in the striatum was observed at  <dig> to 4 h after injection. time course of expression alterations of down-regulated genes corresponded to the pattern observed for up-regulated genes.

the comparison of transcriptional effects of the selected nmda antagonists
to compare differences and similarities in gene expression after administration of ketamine, memantine and pcp we performed two-way anova with drug and time factors for each drug and tissue separately . the similarities in molecular effects of the selected nmda antagonists are presented on venn diagrams. the overlap between each pair of drugs was tested using fisher’s exact test and proved to be significant in each case . in the hippocampus, the analysis indicated  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> drug-responsive transcripts after treatment with ketamine, memantine and pcp respectively . we found  <dig> genes to be regulated by all of these compounds, including plin <dig>  ppp1r3g and cdkn1a. in the striatum  <dig> transcripts were differentially expressed after administration of ketamine,  <dig> after memantine and  <dig> after pcp at the same statistical threshold . the analysis indicated  <dig> genes altered by all the selected drugs in the striatum, for instance sgk <dig>  fgf <dig> and dnah <dig> .fig.  <dig> comparison of the number of genes regulated by ketamine, memantine and pcp in the hippocampus and striatum. venn diagrams show the number and overlap of genes altered by drug treatment in the mouse hippocampus and striatum. lists of transcripts with statistical significance p <  <dig>  for drug factor after two-way anova in each tissue and absolute fold change greater than  <dig>  over saline control  were analyzed 



gene expression profile of ketamine in comparison to major classes of psychotropic drugs
we performed a comparative analysis of ketamine, memantine and pcp induced gene expression with data from our previous study, which examined the expression profiles of  <dig> drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics and drugs of abuse  <cit> . top  <dig> genes were identified using two-way anova for drug and time factors on combined data followed by correction for multiple testing  and then the obtained results were further used for comparison of the selected psychotropic drugs. expression pattern comparison was performed among sets of the top  <dig> drug-regulated genes . hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis  were performed to classify ketamine among other psychotropic drugs based on their gene expression profiles . the clustering indicated three major groups  that contained clinically and pharmacologically divergent drugs, including  anxiolytics, atypical antipsychotics, imipramine and mianserin;  psychostimulants, tranylcypromine, bupropion, haloperidol and buspirone;  nmda antagonists, fluoxetine, tianeptine as well as nicotine, ethanol, heroin and morphine . the gene expression profile of ketamine was most similar to those of memantine and pcp. the three examined compounds acting at nmda receptors were clustered with two antidepressants and the drugs of abuse.fig.  <dig> comparison of ketamine, memantine and pcp to other psychotropic drugs based on gene expression patterns in the mouse striatum. cluster dendrogram , pca plot  and heat map  were generated based on expression alterations of the top  <dig> drug-responsive genes found statistically most significant. the gene expression profiles of ketamine , memantine  and pcp  were combined with previously published profiles of  <dig> psychotropic drugs from diverse pharmacological and therapeutic classes: mianserin , imipramine , fluoxetine , bupropion , tianeptine , tranylcypromine , methamphetamine , cocaine , nicotine , heroin , morphine , ethanol , diazepam , buspirone , hydroxizine , clozapine , risperidone  and haloperidol , with saline  and naive  groups as the controls  <cit> . the genes were selected based on anova results for drug factor  at a threshold of nominal p < 10− <dig> . hierarchical clustering  was performed using the measure of pearson correlation distance and complete distance linkage methods. the pca plot  displays the pattern of similarity between the selected drugs. the first and second components are shown on x and y axis respectively, while the values of the third component are coded by color and size of the circles as indicated on the legend. a comparison of ketamine to antidepressants  was based on the patterns of drug-induced transcriptional alterations in the striatum . drug effects were balanced using modified minimum-maximum normalization, where the maximum was set up as average from the top  <dig> fold changes for every drug. colored rectangles represent expression levels of the top  <dig> drug-regulated genes indicated on the right



three main components of pca explained 58 % of variance in gene expression . in terms of all three components, the gene expression signature of ketamine was found to be most similar to pcp, memantine, opioids, ethanol and nicotine. some similarities in gene expression profiles were found between ketamine and risperidone  as well as ketamine, fluoxetine and tianeptine . based on the lists of genes correlated with the pca components, we assume that the first component represents drug-induced expression of gr-dependent genes , while the second component describes the pattern of expression of activity-dependent genes . the third component was identified to reflect prolonged drug-dependent induction of activity-dependent genes .

in addition, we have directly compared molecular profile of ketamine with six antidepressant drugs with different pharmacological profiles . the analysis was performed using expression data from the peak  which corresponds with the onset of antidepressant effects in humans  <cit> . in general, antidepressant drugs induced diversified profiles of gene expression alterations in the striatum. gene expression induced by ketamine was most similar to antidepressants blocking monoamine reuptake by inhibition of sert and dat, respectively fluoxetine and bupropion. on the other hand ketamine profile was most distant from imipramine and mianserin.

search for ketamine-regulated expression of specific transcriptional variants
in order to comprehensively examine ketamine-induced gene expression at the level of separate transcriptional units we used next-generation sequencing. from the list of  <dig> transcripts identified by microarray profiling,  <dig> genes regulated by ketamine  at 2 h after treatment  were selected. the mrna abundance levels of  <dig> transcripts assigned to  <dig> genes were extracted from the whole-transcriptome dataset. significant differences in gene expression between ketamine- and saline-treated controls  were identified for  <dig> genes. six of these  express a single form of mrna contained constitutive exons . nine genes showed ketamine-dependent regulation of alternative transcriptional forms. classifications of transcription indicated different types of alternative expression of the regulated genes. for sgk <dig>  tsc22d <dig> and hif3a expression of variants with alternative transcriptional start sites and first exons  was detected. the ketamine-induced expression of specific isoform with alternative last exon  and termination site was found for rhoj. several genes express variants with retained intron , including slc2a <dig>  gjb <dig> and map3k <dig>  moreover, an analysis on the exon level indicated regulation of slc2a <dig> variants with mutually exclusive exons . ketamine-induced regulation of the expression of selected genes on the level of genes, transcriptional units and exons is presented in supplementary results .

validation of ketamine-induced alterations in gene expression
we used quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  to validate the results obtained using high-throughput methods. the experiments were performed using aliquots of the non-pooled total rna  as well as independent biological replicates . the microarray analysis of ketamine effects in the brain indicated  <dig> transcripts regulated at the threshold fdr < 1 %. from this list, three top novel ketamine responsive genes plin <dig>  sgk <dig> and tsc22d <dig> were selected for validation . the changes in mrna abundance levels were measured in the striatum 2 h after ketamine or saline administration and in naive animals. the treatment factor in anova was significant for all of the transcripts examined by qpcr . the effects of ketamine were similar in two independent experiments. greater than 3-fold induction of perilipin  <dig>  mrna after the treatment was confirmed. equal upregulation  of transcripts for serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase  <dig>  and tsc <dig> domain family protein  <dig>  was observed after acute ketamine administration in the striatum. moreover, regulation of the specific variants with alternative first exons  for sgk <dig> and tsc22d <dig> was validated using qpcr .fig.  <dig> validation of ketamine-induced gene expression alterations. the expression of plin <dig>  sgk <dig> and tsc22d <dig> in response to ketamine was measured in the mouse striatum. a ketamine-induced expression of specific transcriptional variants was analyzed using next-generation sequencing . variant classification indicated different biotypes of regulated transcripts  . b the changes in mrna abundance levels were measured 2 h after the administration of ketamine, saline or in naive animals. qpcr analyses were performed using samples from an independent biological experiment . taqman probes allow to distinguish between specific transcriptional variants: qpcr probe “1” spans an exon junction of exons  <dig> and  <dig> of plin <dig>  transcript, qpcr probe “2” spans exons  <dig> and  <dig> in sgk <dig> , qpcr probe “3” spans exons  <dig> and  <dig> in sgk <dig> , qpcr probe “4” span exons  <dig> and  <dig> in tsc22d <dig> , qpcr probe “5” spans exons  <dig> and  <dig> in tsc22d <dig> . bars indicate s.e.m, *** p <  <dig> , one-way anova drug factor



discussion
clinical trials showed that ketamine can induce an antidepressant response within hours from administration  <cit> . the antidepressant effects may persist up to two weeks and has been effective in treatment-resistant patients  <cit> . these observations provide hope for potential use of nmda receptor antagonists in affective disorders. ketamine has also been effective in treatment of multiple severe neuropsychiatric conditions including bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain  <cit> . however, the psychotomimetic and addictive properties of this drug limit its clinical applications  <cit> . the neurobiological mechanisms related to various clinical actions of this prototypic glutamatergic “rapid antidepressant” are elusive. a major difficulty in identifying the underlying mechanism of ketamine action arises from its complex pharmacological profile  <cit> . a dissection of ketamine actions on the molecular level may provide insight into particular mechanisms underlying different behavioral effects. despite the common use of ketamine in clinical and experimental studies there are relatively few reports of its action on gene expression in brain regions involved in the control of motivation and executive functions  <cit> .

here, we present the results of ketamine-induced gene expression profiling and a comparison with psychotropic drugs from all the major clinical and pharmacological classes. additionally, the molecular profile of ketamine was analyzed on the level of alternative transcriptional variants using whole-transcriptome resequencing technology. this study was designed to analyze time course of gene expression changes in response to ketamine, pcp and memantine in the striatum and hippocampus. we found that the three factors  contributed to different extents to the profile of gene transcription in the brain. most differences were observed between the analyzed tissues, however extensive alterations were also related to the diurnal cycle. these results are in agreement with previous studies describing that in the brain, the tissue factor is the main source of variance in expression profiling experiments  <cit> . nevertheless, we found that the effects of the selected nmda antagonists are similar in both the analyzed regions, striatum and hippocampus, in terms of top regulated genes. both these regions receive dopaminergic inputs from the ventral midbrain that may explain similar transcriptional alterations in response to the selected psychoactive compounds  <cit> . the time course of gene expression alterations was similar for all the nmda antagonists with maximum response observed at  <dig> to 4 h after treatment. the changes of mrna abundance induced by the nmda antagonists subsided within 8 h following drug administration. this is consistent with our previous observation that drug-induced gene expression is transient  <cit> . moreover, we also found that profiles of gene transcription alterations induced by ketamine, pcp and memantine are similar. this observation may indicate that the main effects of the tested drugs on gene expression are mediated by the blockade of the nmda receptor.

previously published microarray results has been heterogeneous in terms of time and tissue selection. a comparative meta-analysis is, therefore, difficult to perform due to different experimental designs and microarray platforms used. for example, gene microarrays were used to assess the effects of pcp and methamphetamine treatment in cerebral cortices. the authors found that these two compounds regulate a list of functionally heterogeneous genes  <cit> . the identified alterations in gene expression were linked to psychotomimetic potential of pcp and methamphetamine. other studies analyzed the neurotoxic effects of ketamine and pcp. the effects of these two nmda receptor antagonists on gene expression were analyzed in the developing rat brain in the context of schizophrenia-like symptoms in animal model  <cit> . gene expression profiling in rat limbic cortex of uncompetitive nmda antagonists  indicated broad actions of these agents on the molecular level  <cit> . the alterations in mrna abundance levels were also analyzed to reveal molecular mechanisms of neuroprotective effects of memantine. several gene expression profiling studies of nmda antagonists’ effects were performed after repeated administration. the expression of selected genes was analyzed after acute and repeated treatment in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus. it was found that chronic ketamine treatment regulates gabaa receptor alpha  <dig> subunits in the mouse prefrontal cortex  <cit> .

interestingly, among the  <dig> differentially regulated transcripts were genes encoding proteins associated with intracellular pathways associated with the development of mood disorders, mapk and il- <dig> signaling. the first group includes, for instance, the transcript of the dual-specificity phosphatase- <dig> , which is a negative regulator of mapk kinase signaling - one of the major pathways that mediate neuronal plasticity  <cit> . the second group includes the transcript of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase  <dig> , which is implicated in memory formation as well as function of glial cells  <cit> . both these pathways were previously proposed as factors involved in the mechanisms of depressive disorders associated with chronic stress . other group of transcripts regulated in response to nmda antagonists contains genes involved in insulin-mediated cellular signaling pathway, including glucose transporter slc2a <dig>  the regulation of this pathway is potentially interesting in the context of connection between depression and insulin resistance in diabetic patients  <cit> .

the observed effects on gene expression may correspond to alterations detected on the protein level. previous results suggested involvement of molecular mechanisms concerning mtor, bdnf and eef <dig> kinase pathways in ketamine action  <cit> . these processes are related to the development of depression through synaptic remodeling and immunomodulation  <cit> . ketamine has been shown to induce expression of synapse-associated proteins through the rapid activation of mtor-regulated erk and akt signaling pathways  <cit> . moreover, mtor signaling is involved in the resetting of the circadian clock by regulating the expression of circadian proteins  <cit> . the elevated transcription of the period  <dig>  gene in response to ketamine may be a consequence of increased activity of mtor-pathway. both the molecular levels of regulation, transcripts and proteins expression, form a control system for drug-induced plastic alterations in the brain. in summary, our results show that ketamine affects expression of several genes potentially involved in neuronal plasticity. it should be noted though, that these changes are not exclusive to ketamine and are also observed in case of other nmda antagonists we tested.

there were several cases where treatment with nmda antagonists affected the expression of gr-dependent transcripts that are also associated with development of neuropsychiatric disorders. the fkbp <dig> gene is a prime example, as the gene was connected with sensitivity to rapid effects of treatment with antidepressants  <cit> . expression of specific fkbp <dig> variants is gr-dependent while at the same time the fkbp <dig> protein is a critical regulator of gr activity  <cit> . further examples include the hypoxia inducible factor  <dig> alpha subunit , whose expression was found to be increased in schizophrenic and bipolar patients  <cit>  or sgk <dig> and tsc22d <dig>  which were associated with high interleukin - <dig> levels in patients suffering from the major depressive disorder  <cit> . in all three cases ketamine treatment induced only expression of the short transcriptional variants, which again points at the importance of analysis of gene expression at transcript rather than gene level  <cit> . the results indicate that ketamine may activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and release of glucocorticoids from adrenal glands  <cit> . thorough analysis of this systemic response may provide further insight into the interaction between the effects of psychotropic drugs, stress and glucocorticoids. the observed gene expression alterations reveals several aspects of the complex molecular profile of drug-induced alterations in the brain.

despite the similarity between the nmda antagonists, we identified transcripts with diverse regulation induced by these drugs in the selected brain regions. differences between ketamine, memantine and pcp may provide important information for the understanding of rapid antidepressant effects. pcp decreases immobility time, a depression-like behavior in the forced swim test in mice, but elicits more intense psychotomimetic effects than ketamine. on the other hand, memantine did not show fast antidepressant-like properties in animal models  <cit> . our findings have raised concerns regarding the possibility to dissect unique pattern of ketamine effects by using the comparison to other psychotropic drugs. we and others used gene expression profiling to predict properties of the psychoactive compounds  <cit> . here, we used the large microarray data-set to compare ketamine effects with  <dig> psychotropic drugs from various clinical and pharmacological groups.

the profiles of gene expression alterations induced by the tested nmda antagonists were most similar to some antidepressants and drugs of abuse. specifically, the profiles were similar to the monoaminergic antidepressants, fluoxetine and tianeptine. the anti-anhedonic and antidepressant effects of ketamine are rapid in comparison to typical antidepressants. however, the similarities in the patterns of drug-induced gene expression may indicate shared neurobiological effects. a recent clinical report indicated that response to antidepressant treatment is accelerated by the co-administration with methylphenidate  <cit> . it is possible that the combination of various ketamine effects, including boosting serotonin and dopamine activities, may lead to earlier manifestation of antidepressant action  <cit> . as it was anticipated, the nmda antagonists reveal relatively distinct molecular profiles from neuroleptics and atypical antidepressant mianserine. interestingly, the gene expression profile of ketamine was more similar of opioids, ethanol and nicotine than to psychostimulants. it was previously described that ketamine has mild agonistic activity on opioid receptors and modifies the responsiveness  <cit> . these effects of ketamine on opioid system may result in expression of genes also regulated in the striatum by opioids and ethanol  <cit> . thus, this observation supports the claim that ketamine may have addictive potential which substantially limits its clinical application.

CONCLUSIONS
gene profiling in limbic brain areas indicated several novel aspects of molecular action of ketamine as well as two other tested nmda antagonists, memantine and pcp. the presented molecular classification of these drugs positioned them between antidepressants and drugs of abuse. we believe that the obtained profile of ketamine-induced gene expression reflects combination of its pharmacological and neurobiological properties. the unique clinical profile of ketamine that includes psychotomimetic, anti-anhedonic and addictive effects is associated with specific transcriptional alterations. this combination of pharmacological and molecular effects might be difficult to achieve by other compounds even with similar chemical characteristics.
