BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle tissue is able to adapt to various stimuli including neuronal, hormonal, mechanical and nutritional signals  <cit> . termed "plasticity", this process of adaption is made possible, in part, by the existence of multiple isoforms of myosin heavy chain , which comprise a family of molecular motors able to modulate the speed of skeletal muscle contraction  <cit> . the sarcomeric mhc family consists of at least eleven isoforms, eight of which are encoded by distinct genes located in two multigenic regions on two separate chromosomes  <cit> . six genes are encoded by a  <dig> -  <dig> kb segment on human and mouse chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, in a cluster arrangement in the order myh3/myh <dig>  myh1/myh  <dig>  myh 8/myh <dig>  the myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> genes encode the protein isoforms commonly termed mhc iia, iix and iib. the slow-type mhc skeletal muscle  and cardiac  isoforms are located independently from the other striated muscle associated isoforms on chromosome  <dig> in both species  <cit> . the remaining three myh genes, named myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> have only recently been described  <cit>  and are found on human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively. of the eleven sarcomeric isoform genes of mhc, four are known to be expressed in adult skeletal muscle: one "slow-twitch"  muscle-associated mhc isoform and three "fast-twitch"  muscle-associated isoforms. the expression of mhc iib protein is species-specific and has been described in marsupials and various laboratory strains  <cit> , but is absent in human  <cit> , primate, bovine, canine, and feline locomotor muscles  <cit> .

several chronic pathological conditions leading to skeletal muscle dysfunction are known to be associated with changes in the relative proportions of mhc of various skeletal muscles. age-related sarcopenia has been characterised by a decrease in mhc iib and iix protein leading to an overall transition from fast to slower muscle fibre characteristics  <cit> . osteoarthritis has been associated with the loss of mhc iix and iia fibres  <cit>  in the quadriceps muscle, whilst chronic heart failure  has been associated with a significant decrease in the cardiac complement of mhc iα  <cit> . changes in skeletal muscle properties have only recently been described in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  patients, the diaphragms of which were found to have reduced mhc iix protein  <cit> .

in order to understand the complex molecular events involved in the initiation and progression of such disorders, and in the development of pharmacological agents that modulate disease, animal models that attempt to mimic human pathology are often utilised. the laboratory guinea pig  is used for in vivo modelling of chronic disorders including heart failure  <cit> , osteoarthritis  <cit>  and copd  <cit> .

in attempting to monitor changes in mhc expression as markers for skeletal muscle contractile function, a number of methods exist including traditional histochemical studies  <cit> , electrophoretic separation of mhc  <cit> , and the use of mhc-specific anti-sera  <cit> . although well characterised, these methodologies focus on the determination of mhc protein and are therefore restricted to the assessment of changes post-translation. more recently, molecular-based methodologies have focused on the quantification of mhc isoform-specific mrna, allowing the detection of global changes in mhc gene expression that may precede changes in mhc protein, although translational control mechanisms undoubtedly exist. thus far, mhc gene expression has been quantified in man  <cit> , the rat  <cit>  and various other laboratory species. however, despite their use as an in vivo model of human disease associated with muscle dysfunction, due to incomplete genomic annotation, assessment of guinea pig mhc mrna expression has not been previously possible. moreover, it appears that attempts to resolve guinea pig mhc isoform-specific proteins by electrophoretic separation have also proved unsuccessful thus precluding the characterisation of changes in skeletal muscle in response to disease and disease modulation.

because of their utilisation in the in vivo modelling of disease, there is a requirement to develop molecular methods that accurately differentiate the different mhc mrnas in the guinea pig to enable rapid profiling of muscle composition in appropriate animal disease models. moreover, given that little is known about this species with respect to skeletal muscle mhc expression, the determination of mhc mrnas is important both in advancing our knowledge of the guinea pig and in the comparison of mhc expression profiles with other rodent species.

the purpose of this study was therefore to characterise the multigenic structure of the sarcomeric mhc gene family in the cavia porcellus, and to design and validate specific oligonucleotide primers to enable the assessment of the four sarcomeric mhc mrnas expressed in adult skeletal muscle.

RESULTS
study overview
through a combination of rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5' and 3' cdna ends  and bioinformatics, we aimed to characterise the myosin heavy chain  multigene family predominantly expressed in guinea pig skeletal muscle , and subsequently design specific oligonucleotide primer pairs for the quantification of gene expression of the four major skeletal muscle-associated mhc isoforms.

generation of a short fragment of guinea pig cdna
in the first instance, a short fragment  of guinea pig sequence was generated from quadriceps cdna using primer pair gp_ <dig> bp  targeting a region between exons  <dig> and  <dig> that is completely conserved across the three "fast" isoforms of myosin heavy chain in related species  using endpoint pcr. following cloning and sequencing, this novel sequence was used to interrogate the partially annotated cavia porcellus gdna database using blat  to include sequences from rattus norvegicus, mus musculus and cavia porcellus. blat analysis revealed this sequence to be located at the 5' of gene myh <dig> in both rattus norvegicus and mus musculus.

determining the genomic location of other members of the myosin heavy chain gene family
in all other species described, the myosin heavy chain family of genes is located on a single chromosome and arranged in a head to tail fashion in the order myh3/myh <dig>  myh1/myh  <dig> and myh8/myh <dig> with the exception of the cardiac  and slow skeletal muscle isoforms  which are located on a distant chromosome  <cit> . using this knowledge, and the previously determined location of the myh <dig> gene as a starting point, we were able to advance along the genomic sequence data , aligning individual exons from both rattus norvegicus and mus musculus myh <dig>  myh <dig>  myh <dig>  myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> cdnas  to the guinea pig gdna database, thus spatially mapping out the arrangement of genes in the guinea pig . during the course of this study, a full length cdna pertaining to cavia porcellus myh <dig> was annotated in ensemble release  <dig>  we therefore focused on characterising the remaining fast mhc genes.

determination of the gene boundaries of myh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by 5' and 3' race
to accurately determine the boundaries of each of the adult skeletal muscle associated mhc isoforms, the multiple exonic alignments  from myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> were obtained from the genomic sequence, and the newly annotated putative sequence data subjected to 5' and 3' race using primers designed to amplify all three fast isoforms . rna derived from three different muscles was used in the 5' and 3' race protocol to enrich for the various mhc gene transcripts since extensor digitorum longus is known to predominantly express myh <dig> and myh4; soleus myh <dig> and myh <dig> whilst quadriceps is reported to express all four isoforms based on data from previous histochemical studies  <cit> .

both 5' and 3' race protocols resulted in the formation of specific race products which were subsequently cloned and sequenced. for each mhc transcript, 3' race sequences encoded approximately  <dig> bp of coding sequence followed by the 3' utr, whilst 5' race sequences encoded approximately  <dig> bp of coding sequence followed by the 5' utr. the 3' and 5' untranslated regions were used to identify the start and end of transcription for myh  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . for all three genes or race products assessed, the resulting novel 5' utrs encoded three distinct exons, the first two of which fell within a 100- <dig> bp region, the third was located more distantly and encoded the signal to instigate translation . the novel 3' utrs encoded a single exon starting immediately downstream of the stop codon  . all novel 3' and 5' sequences were deposited in genbank 

design of specific oligonucleotide primers
primers for myh7β encoded mrna were designed at the 3' of the coding sequence as determined by the full length myh7β cdna enscpog <dig> . due to the high degree of conservation between the remaining fast variant mrnas, oligonucleotide primers were designed in the newly described 3' utr where more divergence was noted, as determined by 3' race . due to this high degree of homology, the fast mhc mrna primers sets  were subjected to a further assessment of specificity. vectors containing the 3' utrs pertaining to myh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were linearised by bgl <dig> endonuclease digestion , adjusted to  <dig> ng/μl and serially diluted. five-fold serial dilutions were then mixed 1: <dig>  with molecular biology grade water  or a combination of the two competing vectors at a concentration of  <dig>  ng/μl. following quantitative pcr using the sybr-green detection system, no cross-reaction was observed between any of the primer pairs tested .

assessment of three distinct guinea pig skeletal muscles by quantitative pcr
in order to validate further the utility of the oligonucleotide primers designed, three distinct guinea pig muscles were analysed in terms of their mhc mrna expression. based on histochemical studies of numerous laboratory species, including the guinea pig, soleus is known to be a slow, postural muscle with a predominance of mhc i and mhc iia muscle fibres and therefore by inference myh <dig> and myh <dig> mrna variants. in contrast, extensor digitorum longus has a faster contractile phenotype and a predominance of mhc iix and mhc iib muscle fibres . finally, quadriceps femoris is known to express all muscle fibre types and therefore all variants of myosin heavy chain mrna  <cit> . quantitative pcr analysis of guinea samples from the above muscles revealed expression patterns as expected. myh <dig> and myh <dig> were most abundantly detected in the slow, postural soleus. myh <dig> and myh <dig> were detected most abundantly in the fast twitch extensor digitorum longus, whilst all four transcripts were detected at intermediate levels in the quadriceps muscle 

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we partially characterised the structure of the myosin heavy chain multigene family in the common guinea pig . as with other species studied, the mhc genes were found to be located in a head-to-tail fashion in the order myh3/myh <dig>  myh1/, myh  <dig> and myh8/myh <dig>  although exact chromosomal locations are still unknown due to restricted genomic annotation, we found the myh7β gene to be located in a distinct contig, consistent with its location on a distal chromosome in other species. we have designed and tested specific oligonucleotide primers for myh7β, myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myh <dig> mrna variants, and for the first time, are able to successfully differentiate and quantify the adult skeletal muscle associated mhc variants by quantitative pcr analysis.

the methods developed here are suitable for the characterisation of muscle myosin heavy chain complement at the molecular level from animal tissue samples and biopsy material. furthermore, the publication of these specific oligonucleotide primers for the guinea pig myosin heavy chain variants will enable researchers to rapidly and accurately quantify acute changes in mhc expression in either developmental or in guinea pig disease models where a marker of altered skeletal muscle function is required.
