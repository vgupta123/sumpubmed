BACKGROUND
mycobacterium tuberculosis  is the cause of human tuberculosis , which is regarded as one of the most harmful pathogens that is responsible for more deaths than any other microorganism. to date, one third of the population in the world has immunological evidence of mtb infection  <cit> . tb is characterized by the presence of caseous necrotic lesions in the lungs, in which caseous necrotic lesions are mainly composed of cellular corpses that result from necrotic death in macrophages infected by mtb  <cit> . thus, necrotic death has been suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of tb, an inhibition of mtb-infected cell necrosis is vital to the pathogenesis of tb disease. it has been demonstrated that the necrotic cell death, is associated with an energy independent and disordered cell death, which allows the release of viable mycobacteria for subsequent re-infection. although several lines of recent studies suggested that necrosis could also follow a strictly programmed and ordered series of events  <cit> , the precise mechanism underlying the necrosis of mtb-infected host cells remains largely unknown.

a necrotic cell can be morphologically characterized by vacuolation of the cytoplasm, breakdown of the plasma membrane and an induction of inflammation around the dying cell attributable to the release of cellular contents and pro-inflammatory molecules. the necrosis of cells can be triggered mainly by cellular ‘accidents’ such as toxic insults, physical damage or reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in this regard, ros can act as an important mediator of cell death, and has strongly implicated in the aforementioned detrimental response by host that results in self-injury  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying ros-mediated cell death currently have not been fully demonstrated. there are several studies suggested that ros was involved in the necrosis of many cell types  <cit> . for instances, zhang et al. uncovered a role of receptor-interacting protein  <dig>  in cell apoptosis/necrosis induced by tumor-necrosis factor -α switching, by which cell necrosis could occur partly through an increasing energy metabolism–associated ros production  <cit> . such a ros-mediated cell necrosis was also found in human hepatocellular carcinoma sk-hep <dig> cells treated with β-lapachone, where β-lapachone could induce cell necrosis through an activation of ros mediated rip <dig> /poly adp-ribose polymerase  <dig> /apoptosis inhibition factor  signaling pathway  <cit> . however, recent studies demonstrated that the tnf-induced necrosis and parp-1-mediated necrosis represented distinct routes to programmed necrotic cell death  <cit> , suggesting a cell context-dependent and/or insult-dependent cell necrosis pathway.

the canonical  pathway, have been evidenced to be involved in the interaction of mtb and macrophage  <cit> , and alveolar epithelial cells  <cit> . an increasing number of studies has demonstrated a regulatory role of wnt signaling in cell apoptosis or cell death  <cit> . our previous study also demonstrated that an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling was able to promote apoptosis of macrophage raw <dig> cells infected with bacillus calmette-guerin   <cit> . however, the mechanism underpinning the modulatory role of wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell death, in particular of necrosis of immune cells in response to various pathogen infections remains largely elusive. with this in mind, we thus interrogated the impact of the activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling in the cell necrosis of macrophages in response to bcg infection using a murine macrophage raw <dig>  cell line.

RESULTS
bcg induced-raw <dig>  cell necrosis can be inhibited by an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling
in order to evaluate the necrosis of macrophages in response to mycobacterial infection, the murine alveolar raw <dig>  macrophage cells were infected with bcg at different dosages for varied time points. results of flow cytometric analysis revealed a dose- and time- dependent reduction of cell viability and increased necrotic cell fraction following the bcg infection, indicating that bcg was able to induce raw <dig>  macrophage necrosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner . intriguingly, the bcg-induced cell necrosis could be significantly reduced when the cells were exposed to wnt 3a, a ligand of the wnt/β-catenin signaling . on the contrary, cells enforced expression of wnt signaling antagonist dkk <dig> exhibited an opposite effect of wnt3a in raw <dig>  cells, where the introduction of dkk <dig> displayed a capacity to promote bcg induced-cell necrosis . the function of wnt/β-catenin signaling in inhibition of bcg-induced macrophage necrosis was further morphologically confirmed by accessing the characteristics necrotic cells using scanning electronic microscopy  and transmission electronic microscopy  . the em images of raw <dig>  cells revealed that the majority of cells exposed to control-cm showed healthy morphology, characterized with an integrity of nuclear membrane with abundant surrounding microvilli, uniform cytoplasm with rare cytoplasmic vacuoles, well-organized organelles, nuclei with clear membrane bounder, and uniform speckled distributed chromatin . while increasing numbers of necrotic cells was observed in cells exposed to bcg, which were characterized with loss of microvilli, disappearance of plasma membrane integrity and the presence of cellular organelles . importantly, quantitative analysis demonstrated that the addition of wnt3a-cm significantly could inhibit the bcg-infected cells to necrotic cell death, in comparison with the control-cm treated cells when the necrotic cell numbers were determined by an em morphology  . these morphological results provided further evidence that activation of wnt/β-catenin may inhibit necrosis in mycobacteria-infected macrophages.figure  <dig>

wnt/β-catenin signaling suppresses the production of ros in bcg-infected raw <dig>  cells
the importance of the balance between ros production and scavenging is underscored by observations that oxidative stress can be either protective or damaging in several diseases  <cit> . with this in mind, we next examined whether the infection of bcg was able to induce raw <dig>  macrophages to produce ros that subsequently induced cell necrosis. as expected, a dose- and time-dependent ros production was determined in the raw <dig>  cells when they were infected with bcg at moi of  <dig> or less for up to 6 h . to verify whether bcg induces macrophages necrosis by ros, a ros scavenger nac was employed to determine the impact of ros on bcg-induced cell necrosis. as shown in figure 4a, the addition of nac  could significantly inhibit the bcg-induced ros content, along with a decreased necrosis rate  . of note, the increased level of ros was correlated with the necrotic death of raw <dig>  cells in response to bcg infection.figure  <dig>

ros is involved in the bcg-induced necrosis in raw <dig>  cells. the effect of ros in the necrosis of bcg-infected cells was verified using a ros scavenger nac.  raw <dig>  cells were treated with bcg, nac, or their combination, then they were used for intracellular ros measurement by a flow cytometry assay within 6 h.  representatives of scatter dot plot of flow cytometric analysis for the necrosis cell fraction for raw <dig>  cells infected with bcg, nac, or their combination.  nac inhibits bcg-induced cell necrosis. raw <dig>  cells were infected with bcg at moi of  <dig> for 24 h prior to be used for flow cytometric analysis. quantitative results revealed that nac could inhibit cell necrosis induced by bcg. compared to a control-cm treated cells, *: p <  <dig> ; **: p <  <dig> ; compared to its corresponding bcg treated cells, #: p <  <dig> ; ##: p <  <dig> . data represented the mean ± sd from three independent triplicated experiments .



therefore, we next sought to explore whether an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling had an impact on the production of ros. noteworthy, a remarkable reduction of intracellular ros production was observed in bcg-infected raw <dig>  cells that exposed to wnt3a-cm . the wnt3a-mediated ros scavenging activity was further confirmed by addition of h2o <dig> into raw <dig>  cell cultures at final concentration of 500 μmol/l, in which the wnt3a-cm showed a capacity to dramatically reduce the ros level . these data imply that an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling can repress the bcg-induced cell necrosis through a mechanism of reducing the accumulation of intracellular ros.

wnt/β-catenin signaling induces the production of glutathione  in raw <dig>  cells
next, we attempted to understand a possible underlying mechanism of wnt/β-catenin signaling to scavenge the cellular ros. most recently, several studies demonstrated that the cellular ros could be eliminated through detoxification mechanisms provided by endogenous antioxidant enzymes and antioxidants such as glutathione   <cit> . this study reminded us to examine the gsh concentration in raw <dig>  cells treated with various conditions. the results exhibited that the presence of wnt3a-cm could significantly increase the production of gsh in both of naïve raw <dig>  macrophages and the bcg-infected cells; in contrast, cells transfected with wnt signaling antagonist dkk <dig> displayed an opposite function seen in the wnt3a-cm treated cells, i.e. the expression of dkk <dig> could revise the wnt3a-induced gsh productions . to further confirm the capacity of wnt3a to induce intracellular gsh production upon an external insults, the intracellular gsh levels of raw <dig>  cells treated with h2o <dig>  lipopolysaccharide , h2o2/wnt3a or lps/wnt3a were measured. indeed, the addition of wnt3a-cm could markedly increase the gsh levels in raw <dig>  cells treated with h2o <dig> or lps . these results clearly suggest that wnt3a is able to dismiss intracellular ros accumulation in raw <dig>  cells, which in turn may reduces the cell necrotic death induced by external stresses, such as bcg infection, oxidative stress of h2o <dig> or lps stimulation.figure  <dig> 
activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling increases gsh concentration in raw <dig>  cells. raw <dig>  cells were treated with bcg, wnt3a, dkk <dig>  h2o <dig> or their combination as indicated, they were then used for determination of intracellular gsh levels by an elisa for gsh.  impact of wnt/β-catenin signaling on gsh production of raw <dig>  cells infected with bcg at moi of  <dig> for 6 h. an activation of wnt signaling by addition of wnt3a-cm could induce gsh generation; in contrast, overexpression of wnt inhibitor dkk <dig> reduced gsh levels.  impact of wnt/β-catenin signaling on gsh production of raw <dig>  cells exposed to oxidative stress h2o <dig>  or lps  stimulation for 6 h. the wnt signaling could increase intracellular reduced gsh concentration in cells stressed by h2o <dig> and lps. compared to a control-cm treated cells, *: p <  <dig> , **: p <  <dig> . control-cm treated cells compared to its corresponding wnt3a-cm treated cells, #: p <  <dig> ; ##: p <  <dig> . data represented the mean ± sd from three independent triplicate experiments .



down-regulated parp- <dig> and aif expression is involved in the wnt/β-catenin signaling reduced bcg-induced necrosis in raw <dig>  cells
since the parp- <dig> has been demonstrated to contribute dna base excision repair and maintenance of genomic stability  <cit> . a ros-induced dna damage could activate parp-1; an over activated parp- <dig> could rapidly utilize substrate nad+ to transfer poly adp-ribose  to itself and to nuclear acceptor proteins, subsequently the host cell consumes its atp pools to resynthesize nad+, which resulted in the host cell energy crisis and cell death  <cit> . moreover, recently study suggested an involvement of parp- <dig> in the ros-induced cell necrotic death  <cit> . with this in mind, we thus interrogated the impact of wnt/β-catenin signaling on parp- <dig> of bcg-infected raw <dig>  cells by an immunoblotting analysis. the results showed an increased abundance of parp- <dig> and its downstream signaling protein aif, as well as the cleaved form parp- <dig> protein in bcg-infected cells . of note, the addition of wnt3a-cm could suppress the bcg-induced parp- <dig> and aif protein expression, and inhibit the parp- <dig> activity by reducing the cleaved form of parp- <dig> protein in raw <dig>  cells . equal importantly, the pharmacological inhibitor of parp- <dig>  3-ab also showed an activity to impair parp- <dig> activation by inhibiting parp- <dig> cleavage and aif expression . to verify whether wnt3a has an impact on the cellular nad+ level, a marker of parp-dependent cell necrosis, the cellular nad+ content was detected. as shown in figure 6b, wnt3a could inhibit the depletion of the bcg-induced cellular nad+. on the contrary, an introduced expression of wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor dkk <dig> could significantly reversed the effect of wnt3a . in order to confirm whether the parp- <dig> pathway was involved in the wnt signaling-modulated necrosis in raw  <dig>  cells infected with bcg, the frequencies of necrotic death of raw <dig>  cells treated with bcg, wnt3a, 3-ab alone or a combination were ascertained by a flow cytometric analysis . a time-dependent cell necrosis was found in raw <dig>  cells infected with bcg, more abundant necrotic cell death was observed at 36 h post bcg infection as compared with that at 6 h . notably, the addition of wnt3a-cm or parp- <dig> inhibitor 3-ab alone could significantly reduce the bcg-induced cell necrosis  . these results suggest that wnt3a can inhibit necrosis of bcg-infected macrophage cells through the ros-mediated parp1/aif signaling pathway.figure  <dig> 
parp-1/aif pathway is involved in bcg-induced raw <dig>  cell necrosis. raw <dig>  cells were treated with indicated conditions for 24 h, the cells were then collected for immunobotting analysis or flow cytometric analysis.  immunoblotting analysis for parp- <dig> and its downstream mediator aif proteins in raw <dig>  cells treated with indicated conditions for 24 h. both wnt3a-cm and parp- <dig> inhibitor 3-ab displayed an ability to down-regulate parp- <dig> and aif.  nad+ analysis for nad+ in raw <dig>  cells treated with indicated conditions for 12 h. wnt3a could inhibit the nad+ depletion of raw <dig>  cells infected with bcg.  flow cytometric analysis showed a time-dependent inhibition of bcg-induced necrosis mediated by wnt3a or parp- <dig> inhibitor 3-ab , suggesting the parp- <dig> was involved in bcg-induced necrosis for raw <dig>  cells, and the wnt signaling could inhibit raw <dig>  cell necrosis by down-regulation of parp- <dig> activity.  representatives of scatter dot plot from three independent experiments of flow cytometric analysis of the necrotic fraction of raw <dig>  cells treated with indicated conditions for 6 h. compared to a control-cm treated cells * or #: p <  <dig> , ** or ##: p <  <dig> . control-cm treated cells compared to its corresponding wnt3a-cm treated cells, #: p <  <dig> ; ##: p <  <dig> . data represented the mean ± sd from three independent triplicate experiments .



discussion
a large body of study has demonstrated that wnt signaling is capable of governing cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis through multiple intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . in this regard, the canonical wnt signaling possesses a property of regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in a cell-context dependent manner, by which the activated wnt/β-catenin signaling was able to enhance cell proliferation but also induce apoptosis in a variety of cells  <cit> . our previous study also revealed that an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling could promote apoptosis for bcg-infected macrophage, in part through a caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway  <cit> . along similar lines, in this study, we found that an activation of canonical wnt signaling could inhibit the bcg-induced macrophage necrosis, at least in part through the ros-mediated parp1-aif signaling pathway.

with regard to cell death induced by an external insult, oxidative stress and ros are known to implicate in a number of physiological and pathological processes, leading to various biological consequences including necrosis  <cit> . in this context, free oxygen radicals are highly toxic to pathogens and are utilized as a tool for host cells to prevent colonization of tissues by microorganisms  <cit> . therefore, ros production has been recognized as one of the earliest innate immune responses of host cells in response to a microbial invasion. despite the mode of ros production may be cell context and insult-dependent, previous studies suggest that ros can act as a common signal triggering cell death through the activation of mapk and/or jnk pathway  <cit> . in agreement with these findings, in the present study, we found a dose- and time-dependent ros production, along with an increased numbers of necrotic cell death in raw <dig>  cells in response to bcg infection. equal importantly, an activation of canonical signaling by addition of wnt3a-cm exhibited a decreased ros production and cell necrosis in these cells, regardless of bcg infection. such inhibitory role of wnt/β-catenin in ros production and necrosis was tightly correlated with suppressed expressions of parp- <dig> and its downstream mediator aif, and an inhibited parp- <dig> activity. such a parp- <dig> signaling pathway induced necrosis was also found in human hepatocellular carcinoma sk-hep <dig> cells  <cit>  and ht- <dig> cells  <cit> . most recently, jiang et al. found that wnt signaling pathway was involved in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head  by suppressing pparγ expression  <cit> . conversely, a combination of wnt signaling inhibitor dkk <dig> and hypoxia could cause a necrotic osteocytic cell death; and blocking of dkk- <dig> was able to protect bone cells from glucocorticoid and hypoxia-induced cell injury  <cit> . together with our findings, these studies suggest a cell context-dependent modulatory role of wnt signaling in cell necrosis.

parp- <dig> is a zinc finger protein that belongs to a family of  <dig> identified genes that transcribe poly  polymerases, enzymes that catalyze the covalent transfer of poly-adp units from nad+ to acceptor proteins. it is known as a key effector capable of amplifying necrotic signals in a necrotic pathway by which parp- <dig> contributes to dna base excision repair and the maintenance of genomic stability  <cit> . in addition, an increasing number of studies revealed that aif was a mediator for cell necrosis. aif could be translocated from the mitochondria to the cytosol and nucleus where it bound with dna and rna to induce caspase-independent chromatinolysis in the nucleus  <cit> . as gsh is an important intracellular scavenger for ros, and the ratio between oxidized glutathione and reduced glutathione  has been used as an important index of the redox balance in the cell and consequently of cellular oxidative stress, an increased gsh level may be able to attenuate an oxidative stress  <cit> . indeed, in the current study, an inverse correlation of gsh concentration and intracellular ros level was observed in raw <dig>  cells treated with different conditions. intriguingly, an activation of wnt signaling could increase the concentration of intracellular gsh, subsequently reduced the ros accumulation in cells infected with bcg. it is worthy to note that the infection of bcg did not lead a reduction of cellular gsh content in raw <dig>  cells, suggesting that the increased gsh content induced by wnt3a might not the solo mechanism for elimination of bcg-induced ros, despite the wnt-induced intracellular gsh showed an ability to eliminate the bcg-induced ros in this study. in addition, the process of ros generation was complicated, for example, a bcg-up-regulated antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin ll-37could lead a rapid ros production in human epithelial cells  <cit> . moreover, nad depletion is an essential event in the sequence leading from parp- <dig> activation to cell death, in which nad is required for maintaining parp functions  <cit> .

limitations
certain limitations to our findings must be considered. particularly an avirulent mycobacterial strain bcg and a murine macrophage cell line were used in this study. in future studies, primary macrophages and virulent mycobacteria should be employed to investigate the impacts of wnt/β-catenin signaling in macrophages in response to mycobacterial infection and verify our current findings.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported in this study demonstrate that a ros mediated parp-1/aif pathway is involved in the bcg-induced necrosis of alveolar macrophage raw <dig>  cells. interestingly, an activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling can inhibit the bcg-induced necrosis in part through the parp-1/aif pathway, by which wnt/β-catenin signaling down-regulates expressions of parp- <dig> and aif, and induces the production of gsh that scavenges intracellular ros accumulation. we thus uncovered a novel underlying mechanism of the wnt/β-catenin signaling in necrotic death of macrophage in response to a mycrobacterial infection. of note, other necrosis pathways may also be involved in the wnt-mediated inhibition of cell necrosis, which need to be defined in future study. further study on the regulation of wnt/β-catenin signaling on macrophage necrosis induced by mtb will be helpful for better understanding immune regulation and for developing new preventive and therapeutic strategies for tb.
