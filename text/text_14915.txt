BACKGROUND
validamycin a , a basic c7n aminocyclitol-containing antibiotic, has been widely used as an antifungal agent against rice sheath blight disease in china and other eastern asian countries  <cit> . meanwhile, its transformed product valienamine is a pharmaceutically important precursor for the synthesis of voglibose, a highly effective drug for insulin-independent diabetes  <cit> . val-a is produced at large scale in china by the derivatives of streptomyces hygroscopicus var. jinggangensis  <dig>  for more than 40 years. in other countries including japan and korea, val-a is produced by s. hygroscopicus var. limoneus <cit> . moreover, a relatively higher fermentation temperature  for strain  <dig>  rather than 30°c for normal streptomyces growth and sporulation, rendered remarkably increased val-a yield, which stands for an unusual example of positive thermo-regulation on antibiotic production  <cit> .

earlier interests and intensive investigation into the primary metabolism, genetic manipulation, bio-catalysis, and biotransformation of the val-a producers were greatly stimulated by its agro-medical importance  <cit> . feeding experiment with isotope-labeled compounds had established that the sedoheptulose 7-phosphate from the pentose phosphate pathway and d-glucose are the precursors for val-a biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, feeding with a series of 15 n-labeled precursors showed that glutamate is the likely primary source of the bridge nitrogen  <cit> . recently, the complete val-a biosynthetic gene clusters were independently cloned from strain  <dig>  s. hygroscopicus var. yingchengensis 10– <dig>  and s. hygroscopicus var. limoneus <cit> . subsequent genetic and biochemical analysis of  <dig> val-a biosynthetic genes confirmed that the sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and udp-glucose are indeed the precursors and cofactors co2+, mg2+/mn2+, zn2+, gtp/atp, and nad+ are essentially required for val-a biosynthesis  <cit> . moreover, a correlation between enhanced val-a productivity and an increased transcription of biosynthetic genes was established in strain  <dig> at 37°c instead of 30°c  <cit> . functional studies of the val-a biosynthetic genes at genetic and biochemical levels have also enabled much improved val-a productivity, e.g. through feeding proper amount of co2+, duplicating biosynthetic gene set, or enhancing udp-glucose biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the mechanism of the thermo-regulation of val-a production by strain  <dig> remains largely unknown.

to date, the whole genomes of several antibiotic-producing actinomycetes have been sequenced, including the avermectin producer s. avermitilis, the erythromycin producer saccharopolyspora erythraea, the streptomycin producer s. griseus, and the rifamycin producer amycolatopsis mediterranei <cit> . since the advent of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, the genome-based functional studies of antibiotic producers shed new lights on antibiotic biosynthesis, development, regulation, phylogeny and evolution, and mining of the rich repertoire of secondary metabolites  <cit> . in this study, we completely sequenced the genome of s. hygroscopicus  <dig> and analyzed its transcriptomes by cultivating the strain at 30°c or 37°c. a streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein -family regulator was identified to be involved in a positive control of the thermo-regulated val-a biosynthesis by strain  <dig> 

RESULTS
general features of the s. hygroscopicus  <dig> genome
except for a linear chromosome, the strain  <dig> also harbors a linear plasmid pshjg <dig> and a  <dig> -bp large circular plasmid . in order to clone both ends of the linear chromosome and plasmid pshjg <dig>  we searched for a putative helicase gene homologous to ttra, which is usually located in the termini of actinomycetal chromosomes and linear plasmids  <cit> . four putative telomere regions were identified by southern blotting with ttra probe, cloned, and sequenced  <cit> . with a total length of  <dig> ,684 bp, the genome of strain  <dig> is larger than most published streptomyces genomes .

* data were obtained from genbank: s. coelicolor a <dig>  nc_003888; s. avermitilis ma- <dig>  nc_003155; s. griseus ifo <dig>  nc_010572; s. scabies  <dig> , nc_013929; s. bingchenggensis bcw- <dig>  cp002047; s. clavuligerus atcc  <dig>  cm <dig>  nd, not determined.

the linear chromosome  of strain  <dig>  with an average g + c% mol content of  <dig> %, comprises  <dig>  predicted protein-coding sequences ,  <dig> rrna operons , and  <dig> trna genes . the replication origin oric contains at least  <dig> dnaa box-like sequences  <cit>  and is shifted 875 kb away from the center to the right . intriguingly, it only has 14-bp terminal inverted repeats , which is one of the shortest tirs hitherto found in actinomycetes. based on a blastclust analysis,  <dig>   of predicted protein coding sequences  are clustered into  <dig> families.

the linear plasmid pshjg <dig>   contains  <dig> cdss possibly involved in replication, partitioning, transfer and other biological functions. it lacks a conserved telomere-associated protein  and tirs. however, the rightmost  <dig> -kb region of pshjg <dig> demonstrates a strong homology to the right arm of the chromosome, implying an evolutionary recombination event occurred between the linear plasmid and the chromosome. moreover, the left terminus of pshjg <dig> is equipped with atypical nucleotide sequences consisting of several packed palindromes with non-conserved loop sequences, thereby forming a different secondary structure from its right end and both chromosome ends . intriguingly, a complete bacterial immune system crispr-cas  <cit>  was identified in pshjg <dig>  suggesting a resistance to phages and other invading genetic elements by strain  <dig> 

genome-wide comparison among completely sequenced streptomyces chromosomes revealed highly conserved core regions ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb , substantially in proportion to the corresponding chromosomal length. however, the genome of strain  <dig> was predicted to have a relatively small core region , with a left arm of  <dig>  mb and a right arm of  <dig>  mb . syntenic analyses showed that, except for s. scabies, large continuous or separate inversions centered at oric were detected in the chromosome of strain  <dig>  when compared with other streptomyces species .

to further identify commonly conserved or species-specific proteins in strain  <dig>  orthologs shared among the seven streptomyces strains were analyzed by mbgd  <cit> . the results showed that  <dig>  shjg proteins ,  <dig>  sco proteins ,  <dig>  sav proteins ,  <dig>  sgr proteins ,  <dig>  scab proteins ,  <dig>  sbi proteins , and  <dig>  sclav proteins  could be classified into  <dig>  clusters . the major conserved proteins are assigned with functions for transcription, translation, energy production, and amino acid and carbohydrate metabolisms . notably,  <dig>  strain-specific orthologous clusters including  <dig>  proteins for strain  <dig> could be detected. surprisingly, the amfabst cluster  <cit>  and the ramr-activated gene  cluster for aerial-mycelium formation and sporulation  <cit>  were not found in strain  <dig> .

gene clusters for secondary metabolites
totally  <dig> gene clusters were identified in the chromosome of strain  <dig>  twenty are located in sub-telomeric regions with  <dig> in the left arm and  <dig> in the right arm. the val-a gene cluster  is located at a region 350 kb away from the left end of the chromosome . interestingly, the cluster for a peptidyl antibiotic jingsimycin is situated near the right end, which was found to be identical to cyclothiazomycin from s. hygroscopicus var. yingchengensis 10– <dig>  <cit>  . among additional  <dig> gene clusters putatively for secondary metabolites,  <dig> were assigned for the biosynthesis of polyketides ,  <dig> for non-ribosomal peptides ,  <dig> for hybrid pks-nrpss,  <dig> for terpenoids,  <dig> for lantibiotics, and other  <dig> for melanin, norcardamine siderophore, and ochronotic pigment , respectively.

primary metabolism and precursors for validamycin production
the production of secondary metabolites highly depends on the availability of primary metabolic building blocks  <cit> . similar to most streptomyces, the central carbon metabolism of strain  <dig> includes complete glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway , the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, and gluconeogenesis pathway with multiple copies of genes encoding key enzymes for these pathways .

val-a synthesis requires sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and udp-glucose derived from carbohydrate metabolism as precursors. the udp-glucose synthesis is possibly catalyzed by udp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferases , shjg <dig> and shjg <dig> , preceded by the isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucomutase . unlike strain  <dig>  only one copy of ugp gene is present in other sequenced streptomyces genome, implicating a stronger carbon fluxes from glucose to udp-glucose for the val-a synthesis in strain  <dig> . we have recently showed that when a ugp gene  was overexpressed in an industrial val-a producer, increased val-a and synchronously decreased validoxylamine a titers were achieved  <cit> .

a vast array of proteins for hydrolysis, transportation, and regulation
compared with other six streptomyces species, strain  <dig> has relatively larger proportion of cdss encoding α/β hydrolases  and mfs transporters  . there are numerous secreted hydrolases comprising α/β hydrolases , proteases/peptidases , chitinases/chitosanases , cellulases/endoglucanases , and amylases/pullulanases  , suggesting strain  <dig> could use a wide range of carbohydrates, including a variety of mono-/oligo-saccharides, chitins, cellulose and starch.

furthermore, strain  <dig> has a complex regulatory network to coordinate the expression of genes involved in metabolism and differentiation, principally including two-component systems , transcriptional regulators , sigma /anti-sigma /anti-anti-sigma  factors, and serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinases  . nevertheless, abundant magnesium or manganese-dependent protein phosphatases , including valp of the val-a biosynthetic gene cluster, are clustered in strain  <dig> . some of ppms are usually involved in sigma b-mediated responds to stress, including heat, osmosis, oxidation responds  <cit> , which agrees well with the val-a fermentation process at higher temperature of 37°c. whereas each of other streptomyces strain usually has  <dig> γ-butyrolactone biosynthetic gene and 1– <dig> receptor genes  <cit> , strain  <dig> contains  <dig> and  <dig> homologs of γ-butyrolactone biosynthetic genes and receptor genes, respectively , signifying a more complicated signaling network in this species.

transcriptional profiling at different cultivation temperatures
to explore the molecular mechanism of the positive thermo-regulation on val-a biosynthesis, the transcriptomes of strain  <dig> cultured at 30°c or 37°c in liquid medium were compared by microarray analysis. given more shared orthologs  between strain  <dig> and s. avermitilis nrrl  <dig>  we chose s. avermitilis cultivated under the same conditions as a filter. using the statistical criteria of >2-fold change and p <  <dig> , a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified at 37°c in strain  <dig> . likewise,  <dig>  genes were differentially transcribed by nrrl <dig> under the same cultivation condition . filtered with the dna microarray dataset from nrrl <dig>  the number of degs in  <dig> was reduced to  <dig> , and subsequently to  <dig> using more stringent criteria of >4-fold change and p <  <dig>  .

the markedly down-regulated degs at 37°c are largely assigned with functions for amino acid transport and metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, and cell envelope biogenesis . consistent with previous observation  <cit> , numerous ribosomal protein genes were moderately up-regulated at 37°c. as expected, the transcriptional levels of most of the val-a biosynthetic genes were markedly enhanced at 37°c, except for glucosyltransferase gene valg, transporter gene valh, and the two-component regulatory genes valp and valq. furthermore, other three gene clusters of pks-nprss and type-iii pks were also up-regulated by the strain at 37°c .

differentially expressed genes both in strain  <dig> and nrrl  <dig> at 37°c relative to at 30°c are underlined.

although the genes involved in pentose-phosphate pathway were not dramatically overexpressed at 37°c, key enzymes for glycolysis were moderately down-regulated, including the 6-phosphofructokinase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , and pyruvate kinase . moreover, gluconokinase  for phosphorylation of gluconate to generate 6-phosphogluconate and citrate lyase , catalyzing the cleavage of citrate to yield oxaloacetate and acetyl-coa, had notably enhanced transcription, which could increase the carbon flux to pentose-phosphate pathway and decrease the tca cycle .

a glutamine synthetase gene glna and its positive regulatory gene glnr <cit>  were also down-regulated by strain  <dig> at 37°c, suggesting a low concentration of glutamine and a high concentration of ammonium accumulated in bacterial cells. on the other hand, the gene of glutamate dehydrogenase gdha  for converting 2-oxoglutarate into l-glutamate was moderately up-regulated at 37°c, implying a mechanism for generating more amino group for val-a biosynthesis. accordingly, shjg <dig> was deleted in strain  <dig>  and a desired mutant jg <dig> was obtained . hplc analysis of the extracts from the mutant jg <dig> displayed obvious reduction of val-a production .

also, the intracellular concentration of glutamate in strain  <dig> and its mutant xh <dig>  with val gene cluster deleted , was quantified after 24- and 48-h cultivation using an amino acid analyzer. in 48-h cultured mutant xh <dig> with validamycin productivity abolished, the intracellular glutamate concentration at 37°c  was higher than that at 30°c , indicating an efficient synthesis of glutamate in s. hygroscopicus  <dig> and its derivatives at both temperatures. moreover, when validamycin was over-produced in strain  <dig> at 37°c for  <dig> h, the intracellular glutamate concentration dropped to  <dig>  ng/mg dry weight, less than a fourth of mutant xh <dig> and a fifth of strain  <dig> cultivated at 30°c  . therefore, the dramatic decrease of intracellular glutamate concentration and the synchronic accumulation of val-a in strain  <dig> indicated most of the glutamate was consumed for val-a biosynthesis at the higher temperature.

a sarp-family regulator involved in the thermo-regulation of val-a biosynthesis
among the  <dig> markedly expressed regulators by strain  <dig> at 37°c , a sarp-family regulatory gene  was most highly expressed, with a maximum enhancement of 128-fold. shjg <dig> was inactivated by replacing a 610-bp internal sequence with the apramycin resistance gene aaciv in strain  <dig>  generating a thiostrepton-sensitive, apramycin-resistant  mutant  .

the wild-type  <dig> and the shjg <dig> mutant jg <dig> were cultivated at 30°c or 37°c for two days, and the extracts of these cultures were analyzed by hplc. at 30°c, the mutant produced  <dig>  g/l val-a, similar to the amount produced by the wild-type  <dig> . at 37°c, however, the yield of val-a in the mutant jg <dig> was  <dig>  g/l, which was less than 20% of the wide-type productivity  . detected by quantitative rt-pcr, the relative transcription of val -a biosynthetic genes vala and valk of the wild-type  <dig> were increased by 100-fold and 26-fold at 37°c than at 30°c, respectively . however, the transcription of vala and valk in the mutant jg <dig> at 37°c were both dropped to only 6-fold than at 30°c .

furthermore, the mutant jg <dig> was complemented with a cloned shjg <dig> under the control of the perme* constitutive promoter  or its native promoter . a similar amount of val-a was produced in both complemented derivatives jg27/pjtu <dig>  and jg27/pjtu <dig>  at 37°c, which accounted respectively for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the wild-type yield . at 30°c, both strains produced comparable amounts of val-a to strain  <dig> and mutant jg <dig> . these results suggested that the sarp gene shjg <dig> was necessary but not adequate for the thermo-regulated validamycin biosynthesis in strain  <dig>  probably some other regulatory factors are recruited as well.

discussion
frequently, dna recombinations including gene duplication, deletion, and acquisition were observed in or near the long-terminal inverted repeats of the linear chromosome ends in streptomyces <cit> . however, the terminal inverted repeats of the chromosome of strain  <dig> are 14 bp, particularly similar to that of the chromosome of earlier industrial strain s. avermitilis <cit> , suggesting a stable phenotype under higher temperature condition. unexpectedly, we found the variation in length for the core regions of seven streptomyces chromosomes from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, apparently different from a previous claim, which was deduced from three chromosomes with similar sizes and certain close taxonomical relatedness  <cit> . therefore, apart from the chromosome arms, the variation for the core regions could also serve as an auxiliary strategy for streptomyces genome plasticity, e.g. a major deletion in the central region of s. avermitilis was identified  <cit> . also, the presence of multiple-copy protein families for central carbon metabolism secures a vigorous and regulable primary metabolism in strain  <dig>  which probably provides various precursors for secondary metabolism in different niches.

as revealed by the transcriptome, many genes seemed to be involved in the enhanced val-a yield at 37°c. besides the significantly enhanced expression of val-a biosynthetic genes as previously detected  <cit> , a few key enzymes  for central carbon metabolism were differentially expressed to redirect carbon metabolic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates more carbon precursors for val-a production . moreover, the lower transcripts of most nitrogen assimilation genes and enhanced expression of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene at 37°c suggested a condition of high nitrogen supply. also, when the validamycin gene cluster was deleted, intracellular glutamate concentration at 37°c was higher than that at 30°c . when validamycin was overproduced at 37°c by strain  <dig>  the intracellular glutamate concentration in the two-day culture was less than a fifth of that at 30°c , indicating that the glutamate was the most probable primary nitrogen source for val-a biosynthesis, which agrees well with previous feeding experiments with isotope-labeled precursors  <cit> .

also, the majority of genes involved in nutrient stress responses, especially the phosphate metabolism, displayed lower transcriptional profiles at 37°c in strain  <dig> . it was demonstrated that the production of secondary metabolites was generally impeded by excessive inorganic phosphate  <cit> . therefore the low expression of phosphate assimilation genes probably results in a low concentration of intracellular inorganic phosphate, which is essential for val-a overproduction. previous reports revealed that these genes for nutrient stress responses are usually mediated by sigma factor σb or pleiotropic antibiotic regulator afss  <cit> . thus it appears that specific regulatory genes operate in a direct or indirect manner to inhibit the transcription of these genes at 37°c in strain  <dig> 

at 37°c, the sarp-family transcriptional regulator shjg <dig> displayed significantly enhanced expression, whose involvement in the thermo-regulation of val-a biosynthesis was confirmed through gene inactivation/complementation and transcriptional analysis . orthologs of shjg <dig> with bacterial transcriptional activation domain  are widely distributed in actinomycetes, including afsr for global secondary metabolite regulation   <cit> , redd of s. coelicolor for undecylprodigiosin biosynthesis   <cit> , etc. however, the 205-aa shjg <dig> is the shortest and the only identified protein related to thermo-regulation so far among its orthologs. it may mediate the interactions with rna polymerase, other transcription complex proteins, or downstream pathway-specific regulators for the thermo-regulated val-a biosynthesis  <cit> . furthermore, three up-regulated genes encoding one ecf sigma factor  and two heat shock proteins  at 37°c were individually inactivated by homologous recombination in strain  <dig> . obvious reduction of val-a yield was detected in each mutant , implying that the sarp gene shjg <dig> might be under the control of sigma factor or heat stress genes. nevertheless, regulatory mechanism of the sarp gene remains to be further studied. the identification of shjg <dig> would be served as a starting point to investigate the thermo-regulatory cascade for val-a biosynthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the genome of the val-a producer s. hygroscopicus  <dig> was completely sequenced, and the thermo-regulated val-a biosynthesis was investigated through transcriptomic analysis, which highlighted unique features for val-a production and identified a sarp regulator positively involved in val-a biosynthesis. in perspective, the complete genome sequence of s. hygroscopicus  <dig> will highly facilitate the elucidation of the metabolic and regulatory networks for val-a biosynthesis, rational design of high-titer val-a producers, and mining of its potentials for secondary metabolism within the context of functional genomics.
