BACKGROUND
the smtb/arsr family of metalloregulators is present in many bacteria and archaea, and its members respond to a variety of different metals. however, even in this well-studied regulator family, the determinants conferring metal specificity are only beginning to be understood  <cit> . members of this family possess a highly conserved dna recognition helix-turn-helix  domain and bind as homodimers to their operator/promoter  sequences, repressing the expression of operons associated with metal ion sequestration or efflux in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, allowing these organisms to survive when challenged with toxic concentrations of heavy metal ions  <cit> . an evolutionary analysis, coupled with comparative structural and spectroscopic studies of six smtb/arsr family members, revealed that these proteins harbor one or both of the two structurally distinct metal coordination sites, denoted α3n or α <dig>  <cit> , named for the location of the metal binding sites in the known or predicted secondary structural elements of individual family members. the members most closely related to a common ancestor, represented by the arsr family, contain only α3n metal binding site, while the more divergent homologue czra possesses only α <dig> metal binding site. the α3n site is cysteine thiolate-rich, forming s <dig> or s <dig> complexes with large, thiophilic metals including cd, pb and bi, as found in the cadmium sensor staphylococcus aureus cadc  <cit> , while site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid sequence comparisons suggested that the α <dig> site is composed of a combination of carboxylate and imidazole ligands, interacting preferentially with transition metal ions including zn, co and ni  <cit> . apart from α3n and α <dig> sites there are other metal sensory sites found in mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv cmtr  <cit> . cmtr is a pb/cd-sensing smtb/arsr metalloregulatory repressor that lacks both typical α3n and α <dig> sites and possesses a novel metal-sensing site at the α <dig> or the dna-recognition helix  <cit> .

vibrio cholerae expresses virulence factors that allow it to colonize the human intestine and cause the disease cholera. regulation of virulence genes in vibrio cholerae involves the toxr, fur, and hlyu regulatory systems  <cit> . the hlyu regulator controls the expression of hlya  <cit> , and a hlyu mutation attenuates vibrio cholerae o <dig> in the infant mouse cholera model  <cit> . in addition to the well-studied role of the positive regulation of the transcription of hlya, the possibility of hlyu controlling the expression of virulence determinants was suggested by the reduced colonizing ability of a hlyu mutant compared with that of a hlya mutant. a recent study also showed that hlyu is one of the master regulators of in vivo virulence expression in vibrio vulnificus  <cit> . therefore, the hlyu protein itself and the genes under its control would serve as important targets in developing a new-paradigm therapy against vibrio cholerae. using the method of protein fold-recognition we found that vibrio cholerae hlyu exhibits a domain common to the smtb/arsr family. the fact that all the members of smtb/arsr family are transcriptional repressors, in contrast to v. cholerae hlyu being a positive regulator of transcription, suggests that the knowledge of sequence-structure-function relationship in hlyu is desired. the elucidation of the three-dimensional  structure could provide insight into molecular functions as well as evolutionary relationship between hlyu and the smtb/arsr family members. in this paper we elucidate the structure and mechanism of action of v. cholerae hlyu using computational methods.

RESULTS
identification of the three-dimensional fold
to create a model of vc-hlyu, we first performed a blast search for proteins with similar sequence and known 3d structure using the  <dig> residue long vc-hlyu sequence . significant similarities were found with several arsr family of transcription regulators  suggesting that vc-hlyu may belong to the same family. additionally, a conserved domain search  <cit>  of vc-hlyu sequence also supported the above idea. a prosite analysis of vc-hlyu sequence also indicated the presence of arsr-type hth domain signature and profile. in addition, a blast search against the structures in protein data bank  also identified arsr-like transcription regulators, though with lower e-values and ~35% sequence identity . the proteins are cadc from staphylococcus aureus pi <dig>  czra from staphylococcus aureus, and smtb from synechococcus sp., which could be considered as possible templates for modeling of vc-hlyu using the threading approach, which allows to assess the compatibility of the target sequence with the available protein folds based not only on the sequence similarity but also on structural considerations  <cit> . the vc-hlyu sequence was therefore submitted to the genesilico protein fold-recognition metaserver. fold-recognition servers sparks, fugue, and 3dpssm reported smtb from synechococcus  as the best template with highly significant score. inbgu scored czra from staphylococcus aureus  as the best template, which was cadc from staphylococcus aureus pi <dig>  according to mgenethreader. fold-recognition alignments reported by these servers were compared, evaluated, and ranked by pcons server, which assigned highly significant scores to synechococcus pcc <dig> smtb , s. aureus czra , and s. aureus pi <dig> cadc  as the potential modeling templates. the analysis by cath and scop on the crystallographic structures of synechococcus pcc <dig> smtb, s. aureus czra, and s. aureus pi <dig> cadc confirmed that they all belong to the 'winged helix dna-binding domain' superfamily, and 'arsr-like transcriptional regulators' family. their fold is well conserved in the entire superfamily, even if the sequence identity between the proteins in this family is low . on the basis of these results, we can conclude that vc-hlyu has a fold similar to these proteins. therefore, we used these experimental three-dimensional structures as templates to predict the 3d structure of vc-hlyu by using comparative modeling strategy.

comparative modeling of the vc-hlyu
the availability of experimental 3d templates allowed us to create a 3d model of vc-hlyu by using the comparative modeling strategy, taking into account the difficulties encountered with low sequence identity  – a borderline case that has to be treated carefully  <cit> . nevertheless, when proteins used for alignment and modeling belong to the same family in which the structure is well conserved, functional information and overall structure similarity can overcome the problem of low-sequence identity and a good multiple sequence alignment can be obtained, suitable for applying the comparative modeling procedure  <cit> . moreover, information such as the position of secondary structure elements can be used to verify the quality of the sequence alignment and to optimize the position of the gaps. therefore, we performed a multiple sequence alignment, on vc-hlyu and the proteins selected by fold-recognition methods. the positions of the experimentally observed secondary structure elements of templates and of the predicted secondary structure of vc-hlyu were then superimposed onto the aligned sequences. we found good agreement between the predicted and experimental secondary structure positions. these results confirmed the good quality of the multiple alignment obtained, and after a few minor manual refinements to correct gaps, we used the final alignment  as the starting point to predict the 3d structure of vc-hlyu.

to create the 3d model of vc-hlyu, two sets of ten structural models were created using modeller in two distinct sessions, one set using smtb from synechococcus pcc <dig> and czra from staphylococcus aureus as templates, while the other set also additionally used cadc from staphylococcus aureus pi <dig>  we then performed a procheck analysis on the stereochemical quality of the  <dig> models, selected the best model from each session, and used them as templates to generate a new set of ten models. the most reliable of them in terms of stereochemical quality  was selected as the final model, which had  <dig> % of residues in most favoured regions,  <dig> % of residues in additional allowed regions and one residue in generously allowed regions with no residues in disallowed regions, a result expected for crystallographic models with at least  <dig>  Å resolution and the r factor lower than 20%  <cit> . the side-chains of the models were optimized using scwrl  <dig>  program. a complete validation analysis on the final homodimeric model was also performed with adit validation server at rcsb  and confirmed its good quality. the model was also evaluated at the eval123d server  <cit>  using eval23d  <cit> , verify3d  <cit> , prosaii  <cit> , and solvation free energy  of folding  <cit> . results shown in table  <dig> indicate that the quality of the model is as good as the crystallographically determined structures in the smtb/arsr family. furthermore, the plot of prosa values, representing the interaction energy of each residue with the rest of the protein, are negative along the whole sequence , also indicating the overall reliability of the model.

the three-dimensional structure of vc-hlyu
each monomer of vc-hlyu has a fold consisting of five α-helices and a pair of antiparallel β-strands in the topology α1-α2-α3-α4-β1-β2-α <dig> . as expected the model is perfectly superimposable with the templates , the root-mean-square deviations  using cα atoms being  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å with smtb, czra and cadc, respectively . helices  <dig>  and  <dig>  constitute the helix-turn-helix motif in vc-hlyu and the β-sheet is the wing as found in other winged-hths. helix  <dig>  is termed as the recognition helix , like in other hths where it binds the dna at the major groove. this helix-turn-helix domain  has strong structural resemblance to other bacterial transcriptional regulators including cap   <cit> , and dtxr -regulated diphtheria toxin repressor)  <cit> . this dna binding domain, particularly the sequence of the proposed dna-recognition α-helix , is also highly conserved throughout the smtb/arsr family and is one of the distinguishing characteristics that define membership. most smtb/arsr-like metalloregulators form homodimers. the dimer interface is formed by helix  <dig>  and an n-terminal part of the protein  <cit> , as can also be seen in the model of vc-hlyu .

hlyu has two cysteine residues , not linked by any disulfide bridge; c <dig>  is solvent exposed, while c <dig>  is partially buried, as was indicated by biochemical studies  <cit> .

vc-hlyu does not have the key metal-binding residues
comparative biochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies on smtb/arsr family members, reveals that these proteins possess one or both of two structurally distinct metal-binding sites, denoted by α3n or α <dig>  named according to the location of the metal sites in the known or predicted secondary structure of individual family members. metal binding leads to derepression by inducing a conformational change leading to the release of the metalated repressor from the o/p sequence. in the case of cadc, binding of the metal brings the n-terminus of one subunit into position to sterically block the dna binding site of the other subunit  <cit> . synechococcus pcc <dig> smtb binds zn2+, has both the α3n and α <dig> metal binding sites, but only the α <dig> site is functional; n-terminal residues c <dig>  h <dig>  and residues c <dig> and d <dig>  comprise the first metal binding site or α3n site; while the other zn2+-binding site or the α <dig> site occurs at the dimer interface between the c-terminal α <dig> helices of two monomers, they are formed by two residues from each monomer, d <dig> and h <dig> from one monomer along with h <dig> and e <dig> from the other  <cit>  . s. aureus pi <dig> cadc has a similar structural arrangement, α3n site consists of c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> residues, while α <dig> site consists of d <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and e <dig> residues. s. aureus czra does not have the α3n site, but the α <dig> site is present and consists of d <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> residues in the same structural arrangement as in the other members of smtb/arsr family of proteins.

a highly conserved elcvd motif termed as the 'metal binding box' was initially identified in members of the smtb/arsr family  <cit> . this motif was proposed to contain residues involved in metal coordination and, therefore, directly involved in metal ion sensing. smtb and cadc have this motif, 59elcvgd <dig> and 55elcvcd <dig>  respectively in the α <dig> helix , as part of the projected α3-turn-αr dna-binding motif  <cit> . this sequence is required for metal ion sensing by the direct binding of metal ions, suggested by the fact that the substitution of one or both cysteines with non-metal-liganding residues in the 30elcvcd <dig> motif inhibited the ability of arsenate salts to dissociate arsr from the ars o/p  <cit> . vc-hlyu has the the 'metal binding box' 44elsvge <dig>  exactly in the same position as found in other smtb/arsr family members, but interestingly, the key metal sensor residue cysteine in this box is replaced by non-metal-ligand residue serine, indicating that vc-hlyu may not bind metal at the α3n site. s. aureus czra, which does not bind metal at the α3n site, has similar motif 39easvgh <dig> as vc-hlyu. vc-hlyu also lacks the two metal binding residues present in the n-terminus of the protein as found in case of smtb and cadc. this is similar to czra, which also does not have those metal-sensing residues. therefore, the absence of n-terminal metal-binding residues in addition to the presence of non-metal binding residue serine in the 'metal binding box' suggests that vc-hlyu does not bind any metal at the α3n site .

the α <dig> metal site consists of four metal ligands derived exclusively from the two ends of α <dig> helix, forming a tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral metal complex across the dimerization interface, as originally hypothesized from the crystallographic studies of smtb  <cit> . mutagenesis of h <dig> and h <dig>  together, in smtb had earlier been shown to inhibit zn sensing in vivo, suggesting that the metal site across the α <dig> helix may be more important for metal sensing by smtb, in contrast to arsr  <cit> . when we looked at the α <dig> metal-binding region in vc-hlyu we found that again the key metal-binding residues are replaced by non-metal-binding residues, while keeping the overall structure similar to other smtb/arsr family members. the four conserved residues asp, his, his, and glu/his which formed the α <dig> metal binding site in smtb, cadc, and czra  are replaced mostly by non-metal-binding residues ser, glu, leu, and gln, respectively, in vc-hlyu, suggesting that vc-hlyu also does not bind metal at the α <dig> site . we also considered the possibility if other residues, such as e <dig>  h <dig> and c <dig> around the α <dig> helix can be involved in metal binding. but these are positioned in a linear fashion at the hydrophilic side of the helix, opposite to the face involved in the dimeric interface. as such, even if these sites were to bind metal ions the dimeric interface will get disrupted.

m. tuberculosis cmtr is proposed to bind pb and cd via coordination by c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  <cit> . the c <dig> and c <dig> residues are in α <dig> dna-recognition helix of cmtr while c <dig> is at the c-terminal end of the protein. vc-hlyu does not have any cysteine residues at the α <dig> helix, but it has a cysteine  residue at the c-terminal end. therefore, vc-hlyu also lacks the unique metal-sensory sites at the α <dig> helix as found in case of cmtr. another protein streptomyces griceus srnr which showed homology to the transcription regulators of arsr family represses the transcription of sodf gene only in conjugation with nickel-binding protein srnq  <cit> . srnq binds nickel but it did not show any homology to the smtb/arsr family, while srnr has a dna-binding motif but did not reveal any metal-binding capacity  <cit> . our analysis indicates that vc-hlyu does not have any metal-binding sites similar to any proteins in this family.

dimerization interface and inter-subunit contacts
most smtb/arsr like metalloregulators form homodimers, and the dimeric interface is formed by helix  <dig>  and the n-terminal part of the protein. the interface formed between two protein subunits provides the context for understanding the principles of molecular recognition. we analyzed the characteristics of homodimeric interfaces of smtb, czra, cadc, and vc-hlyu using the proface server  <cit> , which dissects a given protein-protein interface and obtains various parameters to characterize it. the results are shown in table  <dig>  the buried interface areas between the subunits are  <dig> Å <dig>   <dig> Å <dig>   <dig> Å <dig>  and  <dig> Å <dig> in smtb, czra, cadc, and vc-hlyu respectively. cadc has the largest interface area due to the presence of an additional α-helix at the n-terminus which interacts with the other monomer in the cadc dimer. the other parameters like interface area/surface area, fraction of non-polar atoms, non-polar interface area etc. of smtb, czra, and cadc are found to be very similar with vc-hlyu . overall the dimerization interface is highly hydrophobic in vc-hlyu as it has a latge non-polar interface area , similar to the other members of the family . vc-hlyu also has three 'self-contacting' residues l <dig>  m <dig>  and l98; smtb has two f <dig> and l110; czra has three f <dig>  t <dig>  and m90; cadc also has three l <dig>  i <dig>  and i <dig>  in a 2-fold symmetry relating the protein subunits, a residue close to the 2-fold axis may interact with the same residue from the other subunit – thus making up a pair of 'self-contacting' residues; these 'self-contacting' residues are found to be important in forming homodimeric interface  <cit> .

interestingly, hlyu with a long n-terminal his6-tag found to be monomer in solution  <cit> , but on cleaving the his6-tag hlyu forms a dimer . as the n-terminal region is found to be important in forming dimeric interface, most probably the his6-tag was creating some kind of hindrance to the formation of the dimer. all these results suggest that vc-hlyu is also a homodimer, as found in the case of other smtb/arsr family members.

protein-dna interactions
homology-modeled structures may be of too low resolution to characterize the protein-dna contacts at the atomic level and elucidate their mechanism of action, but they can suggest which sequence regions or individual amino acids are essential components of the binding surfaces. in particular, identification of amino acids potentially involved in protein-dna contacts may guide mutagenesis experiments aimed at the engineering of protein variants with novel specificities and mechanisms.

vc-hlyu is predicted to be a winged-helix dna binding protein. the two wings , three α-helices , and two β-strands  arranged in an order α2-α3-α4-β1-w1-β2-w <dig>  to form a typical winged-helix motif  <cit> . the putative dna-binding domain has a helix-turn-helix motif consisting of α3-turn-α <dig>  when involved in dna-binding, the recognition helix  might interact with the major groove of a duplex dna, as suggested by other winged-helix protein-dna co-crystal structures  <cit> . the wing w <dig> is predicted to interact with the adjacent minor groove. to find out the protein-dna interaction we created a simple model of vc-hlyu binding to dna, based on the similarity of the dna-recognition motif of vc-hlyu with the winged helix-turn-helix motif of the marr-family transcription regulator, ohrr from bacillus subtilis  <cit> . the coordinates of vc-hlyu dna-recognition motif superimposed onto those of ohrr, and the actual dna in ohrr was replaced by an idealized b-dna model. the model shows that the binding of both ends of the vc-hlyu dimer would require a bending of the dna-helix of about 15° . based on the homology to ohrr the residues which may be important for dna-binding are in α <dig> , n <dig>  in α <dig> , e <dig>  s <dig>  in α <dig> , s <dig>  in α <dig> , in β <dig> , q <dig>  t <dig>  in β <dig> , y <dig>  the positions of these residues which may be required for dna recognition in vc-hlyu are quite similar to what was predicted in case of smtb  <cit> . the proposed model would allow binding of each end of the vc-hlyu dimer to consecutive major grooves.

evolutionary analysis
a phylogenetic analysis of a subset of smtb/arsr repressor sequences clearly showed that the sensors that respond to the biologically required metal ions cluster on a distinct branch of the dendrogram and may have evolved later than those which confer resistance to the environmental stress resulting from the heavy metal pollutants  <cit> . the members most closely related to a common ancestor, represented by the arsr, contain only the first metal binding site, while the more divergent homologue, czra possesses only the α <dig> metal binding site. cadc, with both types of metal binding sites, might represent an evolutionary intermediate between arsr and smtb  <cit> . to find out the evolutionary relationship between vc-hlyu and smtb/arsr family members a phylogenetic tree of  <dig> sequences  was created using the neighbor-joining, minimum evolution and upgma methods. the distance estimation was done using the poisson correction method. neighbor-joining, minimum evolution and upgma analyses produced topologically identical trees. bootstrap analyses were performed on the neighbor-joining, minimum evolution and upgma trees with  <dig> replications. all phylogeny trees were constructed using "mega version  <dig> ", a molecular evolutionary genetic analysis software  <cit> . the α3n and α <dig> sensors appear to cluster on separate nodes of the dendrogram and linked by a common evolutionary ancestor. vc-hlyu was found to cluster along with arsr proteins, which are considered as the evolutionary primitive and the founder members of the smtb/arsr family of proteins . the clustering of vc-hlyu along with arsrs suggests that vc-hlyu is close to the common ancestor from which this family of proteins evolved. these data suggest that during evolution vc-hlyu probably occurred by gene duplication followed by mutational events that led to the loss of the metal-binding residues.

CONCLUSIONS
in recent years, the methodology to predict the 3d structure of a protein starting from its sequence has improved in accuracy and statistical robustness  <cit> . though the conservation of the structure can be inferred from the high sequence similarity, it is well known that in a single family the function and the fold can be retained even if proteins have a low sequence similarity. even if the sequence identity between the target and template proteins is lower than 40%, the secondary structural information can be used for sequence alignment, and the strategy of comparative modeling can be applied with success  <cit> . in this paper, we present results of modeling of vc-hlyu with a comparative modeling strategy, starting from the 3d structures of proteins belonging to the same functional and structural family. the results show that vibrio cholerae transcription regulator hlyu maintains similar fold as that of smtb/arsr family of repressor proteins, but lost the key metal binding residues.

the smtb/arsr family of metalloregulators responds to a wide variety of metals. the metal-dependent transcriptional regulation is the major mechanism of the cellular response to changing metal concentrations. it is, therefore, crucial to understand how metalloregulators are able to differentiate between metals and how this information is translated into transcriptional control. the ancestral member of this family, arsr had only the first metal-binding site. during evolution, smtb retained the site partially, but lost the function, while czra lost the site completely. however, both acquired a regulatory role for the metal binding at a new site . cadc, which possesses both the metal binding sites, might represent an evolutionary intermediate between arsr and smtb. cmtr binds metal at a unique site at α <dig> helix, while another related protein srnr senses metals but only in conjugation with metal-binding protein srnq. using these sites the members of this family respond to an amazing array of different metals and metalloids, suggesting that during evolution one could acquire or lose one or more metal binding sites. however, there is also a possibility that during evolution one could lose all the metal binding sites and show an entirely different function, or vice versa. the structure of vc-hlyu suggests that the evolution of vc-hlyu probably occurred by gene duplication and mutational events that led to the loss of the metal binding sites, and eventually it acquired a function that is seemingly different from the repressors constituting the smtb/arsr family. hlyu is a positive regulator of hlya, but there is no biochemical evidence that hlyu binds to the hlya o/p region. therefore it is still uncertain if hlyu is a transcriptional activator or the regulation observed  <cit>  is due to the involvement of unknown intermediary which is repressed by hlyu. experiments are underway to determine the dna-recognition, if any, at the o/p sequence of hlya gene. the present work exemplifies how the same fold can have different functions depending on the presence or absence of metal-binding sites.
