BACKGROUND
tuberculosis , a bacterial disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis complex , is a leading cause of death worldwide. in the united states, isolates from all tb patients are routinely genotyped by multiple biomarkers. the biomarkers include spacer oligonucleotide types , mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units - variable number tandem repeats , is <dig> restriction fragment length polymorphisms , long sequence polymorphisms , and single nucleotide polymorphisms .

genotyping of mtbc is used to identify and distinguish mtbc into distinct lineages and/or sublineages that are quite useful for tb tracking, tb control, and examining host-pathogen relationships  <cit> . the six main major lineages of mtbc are m. africanum, m. bovis, m. tuberculosis subgroup indo-oceanic, m. tuberculosis subgroup euro-american, m. tuberculosis subgroup east asian  and m. tuberculosis subgroup east-african indian . other major lineages exist such as m. canettii and m. microti, but they do not commonly occur in the us, so we do not consider them here. these major lineages can be definitively characterized using lsps  <cit> , but typically only spoligotypes and miru are collected for the purpose of tb surveillance. classification, similarity search, and expert-rule based methods have been developed to correctly map isolates genotyped using miru and/or spoligotypes to the major lineages  <cit> .

while sublineages of mtbc are routinely used in the tb literature, their exact definitions, names, and numbers have not been clearly established. the spoldb <dig> database contains  <dig>  strains and their spoligotypes with the vast majority of them labeled and classified into  <dig> sublineages  <cit> , but many of these are considered to be “potentially phylogeographically-specific mtbc genotype families”, rather than distinct phylogenetic sublineages with known biomarkers. therefore, further analysis is needed to confirm these sublineages. the highly-curated miru-vntrplus website, which focuses primarily on miru, defines  <dig> sublineages. new definitions of sublineages based on lsps and snps are being discovered; e.g. the rd <dig> polymorphism corresponds to the previously defined spoldb <dig> t <dig> sublineage, also known as the uganda strain in miru-vntrplus <cit> . now large databases using spoligotype, miru patterns, and rflp exist. the united states centers for disease control and prevention  has gathered spoligotypes and miru isolates for over  <dig>  patients. well-defined tb sublineages based on spoligotype and miru are critical for both tb control and tb research.

the goal of this paper is to examine the sublineage structure of mtbc on the basis of multiple biomarkers. the proposed method reveals structure not captured in spoldb <dig> spoligotype families because spoldb <dig> sublineage only take into account a single biomarker, spoligotypes. a spoligotype-only tool, spotclust, was used to find mtbc sublineages using an unsupervised probabilistic model, reflecting spoligotype evolution  <cit> . a key issue is to combine spoligotype and miru into a single unsupervised learning model. when miru patterns are considered, spoldb <dig> families that are well-supported by spoligotype signatures may become ambiguous, or allow subdivision/merging of the families. existing phylogenetic methods can be readily applied to miru patterns, but specialized methods are needed to accurately capture how spoligotypes evolve. it is not known how to best combine spoligotype and miru patterns to infer a phylogeny. the online tool www.miruvntrplus.org determines lineages by using similarity search to a labeled database. the user must select the distance measure which is defined using spoligotypes and/or miru patterns, possibly yielding different results.

in this study, we develop a tensor clustering framework to find the sublineage structure of mtbc strains labeled by major lineages based on multiple biomarkers. this is an unsupervised learning problem. we generate multiple-biomarker tensors of mtbc strains for each major lineage and apply multiway models for dimensionality reduction. the model accurately captures spoligotype evolutionary dynamics using contiguous deletions of spacers. the tensor transforms spoligotypes and miru into a new representation, where traditional clustering methods apply without users having to decide a priori how to combine spoligotype and miru patterns. strains are clustered based on the transformed data without using any information from spoldb <dig> families. clustering results lead to the subdivision of major lineages of mtbc into groups with clear and distinguishable spoligotype and miru signatures. comparison of the tensor sublineages with spoldb <dig> families suggests dividing or merging some spoldb <dig> families. as a way of validating multiple-biomarker tensors, we use them in a supervised learning model to predict major lineages using spoligotype deletions and miru. we compare the prediction accuracy of the multiple-biomarker tensor model created with n-pls  with the 2-way pls applied to matrix data and an existing conformal bayesian network approach.

in the next section, we give a brief background on clustering and multiway analysis of post-genomic data, spoligotyping, and miru typing.

clustering post-genomic data
data clustering is a class of techniques for unsupervised classification of data samples into groups of similar behavior, function, or trait  <cit> . clustering can be used in post-genomic data analysis to group strains with similar traits. it is common practice to use different clustering methods and use a priori biological knowledge to interpret the clusters, but computational cluster validation is needed to validate results without prior knowledge for unsupervised classification. a great survey by handl et al. outlines the steps of computational cluster analysis on post-genomic data  <cit> . an application of computational cluster validation on microarray data by giancarlo et al. compares the results of clusterings using various cluster validation indices  <cit> . eisen et al. clusters gene expression data which groups genes of similar functions  <cit> . improved clustering techniques have been developed, but how to combine multiple sources of information in one clustering is an open question.

application of multiway models to post-genomic data clustering
clustering on post-genomic data can be accomplished based on multiple sources of ground truth. the ground truth can be based on multiple biomarkers, host and pathogen, or antigen and antibody. a survey by kriegel et al. outlines the methods for finding clusters in high-dimensional data  <cit> . analysis of multiway arrays for data mining is frequently used today in various fields, including bioinformatics, to use multiple sources of prior information simultaneously  <cit> . alter and golub use higher-order eigenvalue decomposition on a networks × genes × genes tensor and find significant subnetworks associated with independent pathways in a genome-scale network of relations among all genes of cellular systems  <cit> . omberg et al. use higher-order singular value decomposition on dna microarray data, obtaining the core tensor of eigenarrays × x-eigengenes × y-eigengenes and finding correlation between genomes in the subtensors of the core tensor  <cit> . multiway analysis of eeg data identifies epileptic seizures  <cit> . use of common partitive and hierarchical clustering algorithms accompanied with multiway modeling of high-dimensional data finds functionally related genes in stem cells  <cit> . similarly, multiple biomarkers of the mtbc genome can be used to cluster mtbc strains.

spoligotyping
spoligotyping is a dna fingerprinting method that exploits the polymorphisms in the direct repeat  region of the mtbc genome. the dr region is a polymorphic locus in the genome of mtbc which consists of direct repeats , separated by unique spacer sequences of  <dig> to  <dig> bp  <cit> . the method uses  <dig> spacers, thus a spoligotype is typically represented by a 43-bit binary sequence. zeros and ones in the sequence correspond to the absence and presence of spacers respectively. mutations in the dr region involve deletion of one or more contiguous spacers. to capture this mechanism of mutation in our model, we find informative contiguous spacer deletions and represent spoligotype deletions as a binary vector, where one indicates that a specific contiguous deletion occurs  and zero means at least one spacer is present in that contiguous set of spacers.

large datasets of mtbc strains genotyped by spoligotype have been amassed such as spoldb <dig>  <cit>  and a more extended online version sitvit . spoligotypes can be readily used to identify commonly accepted major lineages of mtbc with high accuracy  <cit> . spoldb <dig> defined a set of phylogeographic sublineages or families based on expert derived rules that are in common use in the tb community. in contrast to the major lineages that have been validated by more definitive markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and long sequence polymorphism, the exact definition of mtbc sublineages and the accuracy of the spoldb <dig> families created only using spoligotypes remain open questions.

miru-vntr typing
miru is a homologous 46- <dig> bp dna sequence dispersed within intergenic regions of mtbc, often as tandem repeats. miru-vntr typing is based on the number of tandem repeats of mirus at certain identified loci. among these  <dig> identified mini-satellite regions on the mtbc genome, different subsets of sizes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are proposed for the standardization of miru-vntr typing  <cit> . in this study, we use  <dig> miru loci for genotyping mtbc. thus, the miru pattern is represented as a vector of length  <dig>  each entry representing the number of repeats in each miru locus.

RESULTS
we used the tensor clustering framework to cluster mtbc strains using multiple biomarkers, and compared the clustering to spoldb <dig> sublineages. next, we used supervised tensor learning and classified mtbc strains into major lineages using spoligoype deletions and miru patterns. we compared multiway and two-way supervised learning methods based on their prediction accuracy for major lineage classification. in the following section, we introduce multiple-biomarker tensors and present unsupervised and supervised learning experiments on multiple-biomarker tensors.

multiple-biomarker tensor analysis of strain data
multiple biomarkers of the mtbc genome in a relational database can be represented as a high-dimensional dataset for multiway analysis. the multiple-biomarker tensor is constructed this way, with one of the modes representing strains and other modes representing biomarkers. in our experiments, we use this multidimensional array or tensor with three modes representing strains, spoligotype deletions, and miru patterns. this multiple-biomarker tensor captures three key properties of mtbc strains: spoligotype deletions, number of repeats in miru loci, and coexistence of spoligotype deletions with miru loci.

the strain dataset is arranged as a three-way array with strains in the first mode, spoligotype deletions in the second mode, and miru patterns in the third mode. each entry x in the tensor corresponds to the number of repeats in miru locus k of strain i with spoligotype deletion j. if spoligotype deletion j does not exist in strain i, then the tensor entry x is  <dig>  thus, strain datasets are formed as strains × spoligotype deletions × miru patterns tensors, as shown in figure  <dig>  mathematically, each strain is represented as the outer product of the binary spoligotype deletion vector and the miru pattern vector, which results in a biomarker kernel matrix. biomarker kernel matrices of the same size for each strain form the multiple-biomarker tensor. generation of the multiple-biomarker tensor from biomarkers of each strain is shown in figure  <dig>  we represent spoligotype deletions with a binary vector , where si ∈ { <dig> }, i ∈ { <dig> ‥,n}, and n is the number of informative spoligotype deletions found using the feature selection algorithm, detailed in the methods section. we represent 12-loci miru with a digit vector , where mj ∈ { <dig> ‥, <dig>  > 9} and j ∈ { <dig> ‥,12}. the entries of the multiple-biomarker tensor which combines spoligotype and miru information can be formulated as:  

where  

and rik is the number of repeats in miru locus k of strain i. multiple-biomarker tensors can be used for both unsupervised and supervised learning. next, we use the unsupervised tensor clustering framework on multiple-biomarker tensors to subdivide major lineages of mtbc into sublineages.

subdivision of major lineages into sublineages
we subdivide each major lineage of mtbc into sublineages using multiple-biomarker tensors. for each major lineage, we generated the multiple-biomarker tensor using spoligotypes and miru types and applied multiway models to identify putative sublineages of each major lineage. two multiway analysis methods were used: parafac and tucker <dig>  details of the methods and how the model parameters or components were selected can be found in the methods section. the validated multiway models with numbers of components for each major lineage are shown in table  <dig>  to evaluate the resulting clusters, we compared them to the published spoldb <dig> families for each major lineage. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  we used the f-measure to measure how well the tensor sublineages match the spoldb <dig> families with  <dig> indicating an exact match and  <dig> indicating no match. the average best-match stability is used to assess certainty of tensor sublineages respectively with  <dig> indicating highly stable clusters. for each major lineage, results show that the tensor analysis finds highly stable sublineages  and that the number of sublineages found using tensors is close but not always identical to the number of spoldb <dig> families.

number of components used in parafac and tucker <dig> models to fit the tensors for the datasets to be clustered. we used the core consistency diagnostic to validate parafac models and percentage of explained variance to validate tucker <dig> models.

f-measure and average best-match stability are used to assess the agreement of the tensor sublineages to the spoldb <dig> lineages and certainty of tensor sublineages respectively.

the f-measure values range from 53% to 88% indicating that the sublineages found by the tensors only partially overlap with those of spoldb <dig>  recall that the spoldb <dig> families were created by expert analysis using only spoligotypes and that analysis by alternative biomarkers such as snp and lsp has led to alternative definitions of mtbc sublineages. the tensor sublineages are based on spoligotype and miru patterns, thus in some cases the tensor divides spoldb <dig> families due to difference in miru patterns even if the spoligotypes match. in other cases, the tensor analysis merges the spoldb <dig> families because the collective spoligotypes and miru patterns are very close. in some cases, the tensor analysis almost exactly reproduces a spoldb <dig> family providing strong support for the existence of these families with no expert guidance. in addition, the miru patterns provide additional evidence for the existence of these distinct sublineages. thus, multiway analysis of mtbc strains of each major lineage with multiple biomarkers leads to new sublineages and reaffirms existing ones. further insight can be obtained by examining the putative sublineages for each major lineage, which is detailed next.

sublineage structure of m. africanum the most stable clusters were produced using parafac and it constructed four putative sublineages of m. africanum, denoted ma <dig> to ma <dig>  table  <dig> gives the stability of each sublineage and the correspondence between the tensor sublineages and the spoldb <dig> families. these four putative sublineages are quite distinct as shown by the stability of  <dig> for each sublineage and the clear separation of the four sublineages in the pca plot in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows heat maps representing the spoligotype and miru signatures for each tensor sublineage, with white indicating  <dig> probability and black indicating probability of  <dig> 

confusion matrix for  <dig> distinct m. africanum strains showing the correspondence between the spoldb <dig> families and tensor sublineages. the stability of each tensor sublineage is given in the second row. all four m. africanum sublineages have a stability of  <dig>  indicating that clear and distinct genetic diversity exists between the m. africanum sublineages. each number in the table represents the number of strains that belong to associated spoldb <dig> lineage in that row and associated tensor sublineage in that column.

the tensor sublineages strongly support the existence of the spoldb <dig> afri_ <dig>  afri_ <dig> and afri_ <dig> families and show that the afri family is composed of these three families. with an f-measure of 66%, the tensor sublineages differ markedly from the spoldb <dig> families for the m. africanum lineage. the afri family results largely explain this difference – afri is spread across three tensor sublineages. disregarding afri, sublineages ma <dig> and ma <dig> match families afri_ <dig> and afri_ <dig> respectively. interestingly, afri_ <dig> is further subdivided into sublineages ma <dig> and ma <dig>  the spoligotypes in ma <dig> and ma <dig> differ by only one contiguous deletion of spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  but their miru signatures clearly distinguish them especially in miru loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the tensor indicates that the afri sublineage classification defines somewhat generic m. africanum strains that can be distinctly placed in the groups ma <dig> , ma <dig> , ma <dig>  and ma <dig> .

the miru-vntrplus labels, determined on the basis of lsps, indicate that there are two sublineages, west african  <dig> and west african  <dig>  within m. africanum. table  <dig> indicates the correspondence between the tensor sublineages and miru-vntrplus labels. ma <dig> and ma <dig> correspond to west african  <dig> and ma <dig> corresponds to west african  <dig>  there is no data labeled by miru-vntrplus in ma <dig>  but we speculate that it is west african  <dig> since ma <dig> and ma <dig> have more closely related miru and spoligotype signatures.

sublineage structure of m. bovis parafac generated the most stable clusters and constructed  <dig> sublin-eages for m. bovis, mb <dig>  mb <dig>  and mb <dig>  while the dataset contains  <dig> spoldb <dig> families, bov, bovis <dig>  bovis1_bcg, bovis <dig>  and bovis <dig>  table  <dig> gives the correspondence between the tensor sublineages and the spoldb <dig> families. all clusters have perfect stability and are well distinguished in the pca plot in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows heat maps representing the spoligotype and miru type signatures of tensor sublineages. much like the m. africanum spoldb <dig> afri family, the bov family defines a generic m. bovis sublineage that spreads across all three tensor sublineages. disregarding bov, mb <dig> consists of all of bovis <dig> and bovis1_bcg strains. since bovis1_bcg is the attenuated bacillus calmette-guérin  vaccine strain, it is difficult to distinguish it from bovis <dig> using only miru patterns and spoligotypes. therefore, the merger of bovis <dig> and bovis <dig> bcg is expected given the genetic similarity between the two groups of strains. disregarding bov, the mb <dig> and mb <dig> sublineages exactly match the spoldb <dig> families bovis <dig> and bovis <dig> respectively.

sublineage structure of east asian  the most stable clusters are produced by tucker <dig> and it constructs six distinct sublineages of east asian , denoted b <dig> through b <dig>  the variability in the spoligotypes of east asian is limited to spacers  <dig> through  <dig> since all east asian strains have spacers  <dig> to  <dig> absent. since the spoldb <dig> classification is based only on spoligotypes, the limited variability allows only two families, beijing and beijing-like. table  <dig> shows the correspondence between tensor sublin-eages and the spoldb <dig> families. the clustering plot of tensor sublineages is shown in figure  <dig>  heat maps representing the spoligotype and miru type signatures of tensor sublineages are shown in figure  <dig>  the tensor cleanly subdivides beijing into three sublineages b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  all with stability  <dig>  spoligotype signatures of these sublineages differ. b <dig> strains have spacers  <dig> through  <dig> present, whereas b <dig> strains lack spacer  <dig>  and b <dig> strains lack spacer  <dig>  miru signature of sublineage b <dig> is clearly distinct in miru locus  <dig>  having  <dig> repeats for most strains. the tensor subdivides the beijing-like into sublineages b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  each with distinct spoligotype signature. they all lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  in addition, b <dig> strains lack spacer  <dig>  and b <dig> strains lack spacer  <dig>  thus, the tensor strongly supports the existence of beijing and beijing-like families, but also suggests that they can be further subdivided.

confusion matrix of east asian  strains clustered into  <dig> groups using tucker <dig>  correct labels are spoldb <dig> labels on the rows, and tensor sublineages are represented by each column. the six highly stable tensor sublineages are indicative of additional genetic diversity within the beijing and beijing-like sublineages.

sublineage structure of east-african indian  tucker <dig> generated the most stable clusters and it constructed four distinct sublineages for east-african indian  denoted c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  the strains are also labeled with four spoldb <dig> lineages: cas, cas1_delhi, cas1_kili and cas <dig>  table  <dig> shows the correspondence of tensor sublineages and spoldb <dig> families. figure  <dig> shows the clustering plot of tensor sublineages and figure  <dig> shows spoligotype and miru type signatures of tensor sublineages. all sublineages are highly stable with stability  <dig>  much like with afri and bov, the generic cas family is divided across all tensor sublineages. c <dig> only contains cas strains. disregarding cas, c <dig> contains most cas <dig> delhi strains and all cas <dig> strains. c <dig> contains all cas1_kili strains. c <dig> contains  <dig> cas1_delhi strains, but the vast majority  of cas1_delhi strains fall in c <dig>  in addition to the common deletions of east-african indian  strains, c <dig> strains lack spacer  <dig>  c <dig> strains lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  and c <dig> strains lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig> and spacer  <dig>  variabilities in miru loci  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also key to defining differences in the sublineages. c <dig> and c <dig> strains differ by variations in miru locus  <dig>  c <dig> strains which include all cas1_kili strains exhibit a very distinct miru signature compared to other tensor sublineages, especially in miru locus  <dig> 

confusion matrix of east-african indian  strains clustered into  <dig> groups using tucker <dig>  correct labels are spoldb <dig> labels on the rows, and tensor sublineages are represented by each column.

sublineage structure of indo-oceanic parafac found the most stable clusters and it constructs nine distinct putative sublineages for indo-oceanic, denoted io <dig> to io <dig>  while the dataset has thirteen spoldb <dig> lineages. table  <dig> shows the correspondence of tensor sublineages and spoldb <dig> families. figure  <dig> shows the clustering plot of tensor sublineages and figure  <dig> shows spoligotype and miru signatures of tensor sublineages. the eai <dig> family acts much like the cas, bov, and afri families, spreading across all the indo-oceanic sublineages except io <dig>  the small manu <dig> family also spreads across four sublineages. the existence of the manu <dig> family has not been well established by other biomarkers. disregarding these two troubling families, the tensor sublineages correspond closely to the spoldb <dig> families. table  <dig> shows that there is almost a one-to-one mapping between most spoldb <dig> lineages and indo-oceanic tensor sublineages. specifically, the mapping between the most stable clusters  and the families are: io <dig>  equals eai6_bdg <dig>  io <dig>  equals eai3_ind, io <dig>  equals zero, and io <dig>  equals most of eai2_manilla. all eai strains are in io <dig> , all eai <dig> strains are in io <dig> , all microti strains are in io <dig> , and all zero strains are in io <dig>  all eai2_ntb strains are in io <dig>  all eai3_ind strains are in io <dig>  and all eai8_mdg strains are in io <dig> . eai2_manilla is divided into two sublineages:  <dig> strains in io <dig>   <dig> strains in io <dig>  while the spoligotype and miru signatures show that there are distinct eai <dig> subgroups, the definition of the eai <dig> and manu <dig> groups are not well supported by the tensor analysis. they may represent a more generic sublineage that is further subdivided. distinct patterns are observable in the spoligotype and miru signatures for most of the tensor sublineages.

confusion matrix of indo-oceanic strains clustered into  <dig> groups using parafac. correct labels are spoldb <dig> labels on the rows, and tensor sublineages are represented by each column. spoldb <dig> lineages except eai <dig> and manu <dig> map to distinct tensor sublineages.

sublineage structure of euro-american tucker <dig> found the most stable clusters and it generates  <dig> sublineages for euro-american, denoted e <dig> to e <dig>  while there are  <dig> spoldb <dig> lineages labeled euro-american. see additional file  <dig> for the confusion matrix of euro-american strains that shows the correspondence of tensor sublineages and spoldb <dig> families. figure  <dig> shows the clustering plot of tensor sublineages. figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> show the spoligotype and miru signatures of tensor sublineages respectively.

strains belonging to families h <dig>  h37rv, lam12_mad <dig>  t <dig> , t1_rus <dig>  t <dig>  t5_mad <dig>  and t5_rus <dig> are clustered in tensor sublineages e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> respectively. in contrast, the t <dig> family, an ancestor strain family, is distributed across  <dig> tensor sublin-eages, with most t <dig> strains in e <dig>  sublineage stability is above . <dig> for  <dig> tensor sublineages. spoligotype and miru signatures of sublineages suggest either subdivision or merging of spoldb <dig> families. for instance, tensor sublineages e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> include t <dig> strains only. in addition to common spacer deletions of euro-american strains, e <dig> strains lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  e <dig> strains lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  and e <dig> strains lack spacers  <dig> through  <dig>  which are all variations in spoligotype signatures of t <dig> strains. this sublineage classification further subdivides the poorly-defined ancestor t <dig> family. strains of lam families on the other hand are grouped in  <dig> tensor sublineages. prior studies have found that lam rio strains identified by snps are found in multiple spoldb <dig> lineages  <cit> . therefore, it is expected that the use of multiple biomarkers leads to subdivision or merging of some spoldb <dig> families.

although most stable clusters of the euro-american strain dataset are found using best-match stability, the dd-weighted gap statistic plot has multiple peaks. dd-weighted gap statistic, detailed in the methods section, is a cluster validity measure which is also used for detecting hierarchical structure in the datasets. multiple peaks in dd-weighted gap statistic plot suggest that the euro-american dataset may have a multilevel hierarchical structure. model order selection with randomized maps by bertoni and valentini can be used to detect the hierarchical structure in the euro-american dataset  <cit> .

we used the unsupervised tensor clustering framework to cluster mtbc strains of major lineages into sublineages. next, we turn our attention to supervised tensor learning methods on multiple-biomarker tensors to classify strains into major lineages.

classification of mtbc strains into major lineages using two-way and multiway supervised learning
multiple-biomarker tensors can be used in supervised classification models as well as in unsupervised models. we use multiway partial least squares  on multiple-biomarker tensors to predict major mtbc lineages  <cit> . in our experiments, we used spoligotype and miru as biomarkers and predicted the six major lineages using the same data as for the above unsupervised learning experiments combined into a single dataset. more specifically, we used  <dig> spoligotype deletions found informative in major lineage classification combined with 12-loci miru  <cit> . we predicted major lineages with the n-pls multiway method and compared it with standard two-way pls and prior results for conformal bayesian networks  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the average testing f-measure as estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. we generate the multiple-biomarker tensor using  <dig> spoligotype deletions and 12-loci miru with one additional bit indicating whether the at least one miru pattern includes letter rather than number of repeats, and create a predictive model using the n-pls multiway method. the model for standard 2-way pls is created by representing the data as a matrix with columns corresponding to  <dig> spoligotype deletions and 12-loci miru with the additional indicator bit, and rows corresponding to mtbc strains. the number of latent variables for both n-pls and pls are selected by inner 4-fold cross-validation of the training set data only.

multiway n-pls and standard two-way pls classification accuracy results when  <dig> spoligotype deletions and miru patterns are used to classify mtbc strains into major lineages. the excellent results compare favorably to prior results based on a conformal bayesian network in  <cit> .


we compare n-pls, standard pls and conformal bayes network  methods by f-measure of major lineage classification and see that they are accurate predictive models with no significant difference between the approaches. table  <dig> shows the f-measure values for n-pls, standard pls and cbn. the average f-measure of major lineage prediction on the same data using the cbn is  <dig>   <cit> . this shows that n-pls and standard pls methods predict major lineages as accurately as cbn, with a slightly better average f-measure value. all three methods achieve outstanding results for major lineage classification with no significant difference between approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigates multiple-biomarker tensors and illustrates how they can be used for both unsupervised and supervised learning models. first, a novel clustering framework is used to analyze the sublineage structure of mtbc strains based on multiple biomarkers. we generated multiple-biomarker tensors to represent multiple biomarkers of the mtbc genome and used multiway models for dimensionality reduction. the multiway representation determines a transformation of the data that captures similarities and differences between strains based on two distinct biomarkers. we clustered mtbc strains based on the transformed data using improved k-means clustering and validated clustering results. we evaluated the sublineage structure of major lineages of mtbc and found similarities and clear distinctions in our subdivision of major lineages compared to the spoldb <dig> classification. simultaneous analysis of spoligotype and miru through multiple-biomarker tensors and clustering of mtbc strains leads to coherent sublineages within major lineages with clear and distinctive spoligotype and miru signatures. second, we demonstrated how the multiple-biomarker tensor can be used to predict major lineages with extremely high accuracy competitive with other approaches. we show that 3-way pls, 2-way pls and cbn models are accurate major lineage predictors for mtbc strains.

the tensor clustering framework is flexible and can be applied to any multidimensional strain data. the design of the resulting tensor depends on the question to be answered. in this study, multiple-biomarker tensors are designed to find groups of mtbc strains. thus, the application of the tensor clustering framework on multiple-biomarker tensors leads to sublineages of mtbc within major lineages. the multiple-biomarker tensor is further validated by the fact that it can used to predict known major lineages with high accuracy using n-pls. n-pls with multiple-biomarker tensors can be used for semi-supervised learning as well. this can be useful for learning predictive models for sublineages in which only part of the data is labeled with sublineages and the other part of the data has no labels. this may result in more reliable and accurate classifiers of mtbc sublineages, and the resulting sublineage classifiers would be a significant enhancement to tb control, epidemiology and research. we leave this to future work.

the tensor clustering framework used in this study can be further extended to find subgroups of mtbc strains based on other biomarkers such as rflp and snps. 15-loci miru and 24-loci miru patterns can also be used to represent mtbc genomes with multiple-biomarker tensors. moreover, more than two biomarkers can be used in the mtbc genome representation. but, ambiguity in the tensor entries is an open question that needs to be solved in the tensor representation when more than two biomarkers are used. addition of new biomarkers will increase the number of modes of the multiple-biomarker tensor, but the multiway analysis methods will remain the same.

other questions of interest can be addressed by designing and analyzing host-pathogen tensors to examine the relationship of the pathogen genotype with host  attributes to examine questions of interest. for example, since the mtbc sublineages are known to be highly geographically dependent, a tensor which combines the pathogen genotype with the country of birth of the host may reveal additional sublineage structure and transmission patterns. a tensor combining mtbc genotype and host disease phenotype such as site of infection and drug resistance could be used to analyze mtbc genotype/phenotype relations.
