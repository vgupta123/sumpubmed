BACKGROUND
many geobacillus species contain a hemicellulose utilization  locus in their genome that encodes for multiple hydrolytic enzymes and sugar transporters responsible for the degradation of hemicellulose  <cit> . the most well characterized hus locus belongs to g. stearothermophilus t- <dig> and its proposed degradation mechanism is based on a limited number of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and further processing of the generated degradation products intracellularly  <cit> . one of these secreted hydrolytic enzymes is an endo-xylanase that cleaves the xylan backbone of hemicellulose into shorter oligosaccharides  <cit> .

the xylan backbone is composed of xylosyl residues linked by ß--glycosidic bonds, and is typically decorated with a varying degree of substitutions containing -α-d-glucuronic acids, α-l-arabinofuranosyl residues and acetyl residues  <cit> . the degree of substitution and polymerization is dependent on the origin of the substrate. substrates from grasses and annual plants are rich in arabinoxylans, whereas hardwoods mostly consist of -α-d-glucuronoxylan. this variety of substitutions requires multiple enzymes acting in synergy to fully degrade the xylans. endo--ß-d-xylanases  hydrolyse the ß--xylosidic bonds to release xylose and  xylo-oligosaccharides of various lengths that can be degraded further by other hemicellulases.

endo-xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> and  <dig> are the best characterized and described  <cit> . endo-xylanases belonging to family  <dig>  can tolerate the presence of substituents, such as arabinosyl residues, better than those belonging to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>   <cit> . an example of the mode of action of two endo-xylanases, belonging to families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  from aspergillus awamori  towards an arabinoxylan model substrate has been described  <cit> . the aagh <dig> was found to be able to cleave the xylan backbone next to a xylosyl residue substituted with one or two arabinosyl residues. in contrast, xylanases from family gh <dig> are hindered by arabinosyl substituents and cleave the xylan backbone only next to an unsubstituted xylosyl residue, producing longer oligosaccharides in comparison to those obtained from gh <dig>  <cit> .

endo-xylanases from geobacillus species belong to the gh <dig> family and have been described in multiple studies . these studies mainly focused on the characterization of activity ranges at higher temperatures and thermo-stability but lack detailed analyses of the mode of action of the enzyme on its substrate. although some studies have described xylo-oligosaccharides formation upon hydrolysis of xylan by the endo-xylanase, the position of hydrolysis and the possible hindrance of substituents present on the xylan backbone have not been characterized  <cit> .

in this paper, we describe the cloning and overproduction in e.coli of gtxyna <dig>  a gh <dig> family endo-xylanase isolated from geobacillus thermodenitrificans. we also determined the enzyme’s mode of action by identifying the generated hydrolysis products and propose a model for the degradation of substituted xylans.

mode of action
activity of gtxyna <dig> towards wheat arabinoxylan , birchwood xylan , and beechwood xylan  was determined as outlined in materials and methods. degradation profiles of biwx and bewx were similar , therefore only the bewx degradation patterns will be further explained. wax contains β- linked xylosyl residues substituted with α- linked arabinosyl residues or with both α- and α- linked arabinosyl residues. biwx and bewx contain β- linked xylosyl residues substituted with α- linked 4-o-methylglucuronic acid . both wax and bewx were incubated with gtxyna <dig> at its optimum ph and temperature for 24 h . both wax and bewx were degraded to oligomers and monomers, as deduced from the disappearance of soluble polymers  and the increase of lower molecular weight products of around 1 kda after 24 h incubation. the difference in molecular weight of the polymeric structures analysed at 0 h incubation is because wax is completely soluble and bewx is only partly soluble  <cit> . gtxyna <dig> incubated with wax and bewx released a series of linear and substituted xylo-oligosaccharides that were identified based on the known hpaec elution of wax digested with the well-characterized gh <dig> endo-xylanase from aspergillus awamori   <cit> . the oligomeric profile released by gtxyna <dig> is comparable to the profile produced by aaxyna, supporting that gtxyna <dig> is a gh <dig> endo-xylanase . only one substituted oligosaccharide was produced from bewx, eluting at 16 min , which was identified as a xylotriose substituted by 4-o-methylglucuronic acid located at the non-reducing end  after 2-aa labelling and analysis by uplc-uv-ms. the uv chromatogram at 340 nm of 2-aa labelled degradation products from bewx and the full ms spectra overlapped. the two predominant masses seen in the full ms spectra were  <dig>  and  <dig>  , and they overlapped with uv chromatogram peaks eluting at  <dig> and  <dig>  min, respectively. fig.  <dig> also shows that gtxyna <dig> is able to degrade wax and bewx to smaller-sized linear xylo-oligosaccharides, mainly xylose and xylobiose. this observation is substantiated on the integrated peak area of linear xylo-oligosaccharides . on the contrary, aaxyna is able to degrade wax and bewx producing mainly xylobiose and xylotriose, but also xylotetraose, xylopentaose and xyloheaxaose .fig.  <dig> molecular weight distributions of wheat arabinoxylan   and beechwood xylan   incubated with gtxyna <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h

• = xylosyl residue; * = not detected




when comparing the diversity of substituted xylo-oligosaccharides produced , it is clear that gtxyna <dig> produces shorter oligomers from both wax and bewx compared to aaxyna. substituted xylo-oligosaccharides are identified in a range of dp from  <dig> to  <dig> by both hpaec  and ms , suggesting that aaxyna is less tolerant towards 4-o-methylglucuronic acid substituted xylan.

degradation products formed during the degradation of wax by aaxyna that where eluting at  <dig>   <dig> and 25 min are absent in the profile of gtxyna <dig> incubated on wax . these xylo-oligosaccharides are characteristic because of the presence of two arabinosyl residues located at the o- <dig> and o- <dig> of the same xylosyl residue. hence, gtxyna <dig> cleaves next to an adjacent non-substituted residue, from the non-reducing end when a single substituted residue is present. in case the xylosyl residue is doubly substituted by arabinosyl residues, gtxyna <dig> needs two adjacent unsubstituted residues at the non-reducing end. in case the cleavage takes place from the reducing end, the enzyme can cleave directly next to the substituted  residue in most cases . however, when the substituted residue , is followed by a doubly substituted xylosyl residue, the enzyme cleaves next to an unsubstituted residue . on the contrary, the presence of more than one doubly or single substituted xylosyl residues obstructs the action of aaxyna. based on the information provided by the hpaec chromatograms and rp-uv-uhplc-ms profile on the linear and substituted xylo-oligosaccharides produced by the enzymes, an schematic mode of action of gtxyna <dig> is proposed in fig. 4b* and d*.

discussion
the ability of geobacillus species to degrade xylan relies on the activity of the hemicellulose utilization  locus. the hus-locus contains a variety of xylan degrading enzymes, sugar transporters and metabolic pathways for the complete utilization of  xylans. xylan degradation initiates by the action of an extracellular endo-xylanase  that cleaves the xylan backbone, thereby producing  xylo-oligosaccharides. the linear oligosaccharides generated by the action of xyna <dig> can then enter the cell through an abc-transporter that is encoded by the xynefg operon whereas the substituted oligosaccharides enter the cell via other substrate specific abc transporters  <cit> . in this research, we cloned and expressed gtxyna <dig>  the endo-xylanase of g.
thermodenitrificans t <dig> and analysed its mode of action.

the purified endo-xylanase gtxyna <dig> showed highest activity at ph  <dig>  in a broad activity range from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  , which is in line with previous reports on endo-xylanases from geobacilli  <cit> . gtxyna <dig> showed activity between 40 °c to 80 °c with an optimum at 60 °c  where previous reports on geobacillus endo-xylanases demonstrated optimum temperatures from 60 °c up to 75 °c  <cit> . the thermostability of gtxyna <dig> was tested in the range of 30 °c to 80 °c. after 1 h at  <dig> and 60 °c the enzyme retained  <dig> and 45% residual activity, respectively, whereas the residual activity after 1 h at 70 °c was only 18% . the endo-xylanase characterized from geobacillus stearothermophilus t- <dig> remains 90% active  after incubation at 70 °c  <cit> . this higher temperature stability of the t- <dig> endo-xylanase may be caused by its production from the native strain instead of a recombinant expression system in e.coli. a lower thermostability of an endo-xylanase produced in e. coli compared to the same protein produced in geobacillus has been reported for geobacillus sp. tc-w <dig>  <cit> , which produces an endo-xylanase highly similar to gtxyna <dig> . alternatively, the difference in thermostability between gtxyna <dig> and the t- <dig> endo-xylanase may be  caused by differences in their amino acid composition. the gtxyna <dig> enzyme was more thermostable in comparison with other bacterial endo-xylanases such as xync from bacillus subtilis  <dig>  that shows around 20% residual activity at 50 °c and no residual activity at 60 °c  <cit> . the thermostability of gtxyna <dig> has great advantage for the degradation of xylan at higher temperatures  over enzymes produced by most mesophilic organisms.

in previous studies, g. stearothermophilus t- <dig> was grown on 4-o-methyl –d-glucurono-d-xylan and the main end products found were xylotriose substituted with 4-o-methyl–d-glucuronic acid together with xylobiose and xylose  <cit> . although we found the same end products in the present study, we also detected xylotriose and xylotetraose as minor end products . only one substituted oligosaccharide was produced, identified as a xylotriose substituted by 4-o-methylglucuronic acid located at the non-reducing end .

when comparing the mode of action on wax, the main difference between gtxyna <dig> and aaxyna is that the former enzyme is less hindered by arabinosyl substituents. this is deduced from the difference in degradation products formed between the incubations of gtxyna <dig> and aaxyna on wax. similar end products were found in previous studies using tlc analysis but, no quantification of the linear end products and no identification of substituted end products was performed  <cit> . formed xylo-oligosaccharides are taken up by the cell via specific sugar transporters  <cit> . these transporters are encoded by the operon xynefg, located in the hus locus, and have a preference for short xylo-oligosaccharides within a dp of  <dig> to  <dig>  more specifically, highest affinity is towards trisaccharides and for other xylo-oligosaccharides the affinity is as follows: x2 < x3 > x4 > x5 > x <dig>  <cit> . the relative quantity of different xylo-oligosaccharides formed by the action of gtxyna <dig> on bewx shows that mostly xylobiose and xylose is formed . the discrepancy between end products formed by gtxyna <dig> and the affinity of the sugar transporter xynefg is most likely caused by the 24 h incubation as gtxyna <dig> is also active towards xylotriose. previous studies demonstrated the formation of xylotriose within 30 min of incubation and prolonged incubation resulted in a decrease of xylotriose and an increase in xylobiose and xylose  <cit> .fig.  <dig> peak area ratio of linear end products after 24 h incubation on beech wood xylan in comparison to oligosaccharide transporter  affinity. green: ratio of affinity of the xynefg oligosaccharide transporter of g. stearothermophilus towards different oligosaccharides. red: ratio of the end product area after a 24 h incubation of aaxyna on beechwood xylan. blue: ratio of the end product area after a 24 h incubation of gtxyna <dig> on beechwood xylan




the mode of action of gtxyna <dig> creates linear and branched xylo-oligosaccharides of which most are in the dp range of  <dig> to  <dig>  these small branched oligosaccharides are believed to enter the cell via specific abc-transporters  <cit> . for most of these transporters their affinity towards linear oligosaccharides was determined  <cit> . however, for the arabino-oligosaccharide transporter abnefj it was shown that the binding constants of branched oligosaccharides where  <dig> orders of magnitude higher than those obtained for linear oligosaccharides  <cit> . it is likely that also other abc transporters that are involved in the uptake of oligosaccharides have higher affinity for branched oligosaccharides in comparison to linear oligosaccharides. the possibility of transporting branched oligosaccharides enables the geobacillus species to use natural substrates in a rapid and efficient way.

CONCLUSIONS

gtxyna <dig> is a gh <dig> endo-xylanase isolated from g. thermodenitrificans t <dig> and is active towards wax and bewx, showing extensive degradation of the soluble polymeric structures to linear xylo-oligosaccharides in a dp range from  <dig> to  <dig> and to relatively short substituted xylo-oligosaccharides. these degradation products are taken up by the cells via specific abc transporters. we have demonstrated that gtxyna <dig> is able to cleave the xylan backbone of wax next to an arabinose substituent on the reducing end and the need for one to two free xylose units on the non-reducing end. in contrast, the hydrolysis of bewx by gtxyna <dig> occurs next to a 4-o-methylglucuronic acid located at the non-reducing end. the thermophilic origin and its extensive degradation of xylans from different origins demonstrates the potential of gtxyna <dig> for biomass conversion processes at elevated temperatures.
