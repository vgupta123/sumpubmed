BACKGROUND

chlamydomonas reinhardtii  is a single-celled eukaryotic and flagellated green alga, whose three genetic systems located in the nucleus, chloroplast, and mitochondria can be used for transformation. this alga is regarded as a “photosynthetic yeast” because of its easy culturing process, rapid growth, short life cycle, and high photosynthetic efficiency. with its three genome sequences, this model organism is highly useful for cell and molecular biology research  <cit> .

in phosphorylation cascades, mitogen-activated protein kinases  are eukaryotic signal proteins involved in extracellular signal amplification and intracellular signal transduction in yeasts, animals, and plants . combined with other signal molecules, mapks transfer external stimuli via successive phosphorylation reactions: mapkkks → mapkks → mapks. progressively and continuously enlarged signals, such as environmental stress factors, including high salinity, high osmotic pressure, and low temperature, reach the nucleus and regulate downstream gene expression  <cit> . in eukaryotic cells, phosphorylation cascades are composed of mapks, mapkks, and mapkkks. homo sapiens possesses  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks, while arabidopsis contains  <dig> mapks,  <dig> mapkks, and  <dig> mapkkks. few mapk cascades have been described because of the complexity of genetic networks and pleiotropic and interaction effects. mapk genes have been identified in plants, such as arabidopsis, rice, corn, wheat, and barley . mapks function through stress-response pathways  <cit> .

iron is an essential trace element for most living organisms. a precise iron regulation system is necessary to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of iron  <cit>  because iron overload and deficiency cause metabolic disorders. following nitrogen and phosphate deficiencies, iron deficiency restricts plant growth and yield and consequently induces crop chlorosis and yields low productivity. in humans, insufficient iron concentrations trigger iron deficiency anemia or iron deficiency syndrome. iron has also been considered a growth-limiting factor in some tumor cells. therefore, iron chelators are clinically used for cancer suppression.

under iron-deficient conditions, chlamydomonas exhibits high affinity for iron absorption that slightly differs from iron absorption in plants. environmental ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron via fre <dig>  on the plasma membrane and then putatively transferred to fox <dig> by fea <dig>  <cit> . afterward, fox <dig> oxidizes ferrous iron to ferric iron, which is then transported to the cytoplasm by ftr <dig> on the plasma membrane . the expression of the genes encoding these proteins is significantly increased under iron-deficient conditions, and this phenomenon indicates that iron deficiency signals in these genes are regulated. nevertheless, the response, transmission, and regulation of downstream gene expression in algal cells have yet to be investigated. considering that the mapk pathway is essential for non-biological stress responses, we determined whether this pathway is involved in iron deficiency signal transduction in chlamydomonas. in this study, arabidopsis mapks were used to search for the corresponding genes in the chlamydomonas genome database , and  <dig> homologous genes, namely, crmapk2–crmapk <dig>  were obtained. the mrna expression level variation of these genes exposed to different stressors, such as –fe, −n, and osmotic shock , was also detected. among these genes, crmapk <dig> is specifically functionally analyzed by rna silencing.

RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis of mapk genes in chlamydomonas
sixteen homologous genes , which are localized in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified by searching the chlamydomonas genome database with blast. the predicted open reading frames of these genes were 1062–5301 bp in length, and their protein products contained 353– <dig> amino acids with molecular weights of  <dig> – <dig>  kd and isoelectric points of  <dig> – <dig> . fourteen of the mapks located in the cytosome were predicted by euk-mploc <dig>  except crmapk <dig> and crmapk <dig>  which exist in the nucleus. using prosite predictions, we verified that the  <dig> crmapks were mitogen-activated protein kinases. multi-sequence alignment of the mapk-specific txy motifs in the crmapk proteins revealed that the ty activation loop motifs were conserved in the serine-threonine kinase  domain in the  <dig> crmapks . crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> contain tey; crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> comprise tdy; crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> possess tsy; crmapk <dig> is composed of tpy; and crmapk <dig> consists of tty. chlamydomonas mapks were divided into two groups by using mega <dig>  group i contained crmapk <dig> to crmapk <dig>  whereas group ii comprised crmapk <dig> to crmapk <dig> . all of the mapk genes contained  <dig> to  <dig> exons. the gene length ranged from  <dig>  kb to  <dig>  kb. among these genes, crmapk <dig> is the shortest and crmapk <dig> is the longest . in addition to the s-tkc-conserved region,  <dig> other protein domains/motifs, such as syn n, rio , cue , and tyr-kc  motifs , are present in crmapks. the annotated crmapk <dig> in jgi database is a small protein with  <dig> aa. after the alignment was compared with the other crmapks, the results revealed that the conserved domain yxtrwyrapel) in the mapk family could not be found in crmapk <dig>  as such, crmapk <dig> is not included in table  <dig> table  <dig> list of the  <dig> mapk genes identified in c. reinhardtii and their sequence characteristics

analysis of mrna levels of mapk gene under − fe, −n, and 150 mm nacl stress conditions
the rna extracted from the samples of chlamydomonas cultivated under − fe, −n, and 150 mm nacl conditions was used for quantitative analysis, and the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  crmapk2–crmapk <dig> expression levels were affected by iron deficiency, nitrogen deficiency, and high salt concentration. compared with the expression of the gene in the tap medium, the mrna expression levels of crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> were increased by iron deficiency to various degrees. crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> respectively increased by 43-, 5-, and 40-fold after cultivation for 48 h. however, iron deficiency decreased the mrna levels of crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig> after cultivation for 48 h. in nitrogen deficiency, the mrna expression levels of crmapk <dig> and crmapk <dig> were significantly increased, whereas the expression levels of most mapks, such as those of crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  crmapk <dig>  and crmapk <dig>  of c. reinhardtii were inhibited, and the mrna expression levels of these genes were significantly decreased. the mrna expression levels of all mapk genes were also inhibited under high salt  condition, and the mrna expression of crmapk <dig> was reduced by 10e <dig> fig.  <dig> results of qpcr analysis of the crmapk genes under − fe, −n, or 150 mm nacl conditions. c. reinhardtii cc <dig> was pre-cultured in tap to the mid-logarithmic phase, followed by centrifugation and resuspension in tap, tap-fe, tap-n, and tap with 150 mm nacl. all the samples continued culturing for  <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h. the cells were collected, and rna samples were isolated. the gene transcript levels were determined using real time quantitative pcr. all expression values were normalized to the value of the 18s rrna gene. the relative amounts were calibrated based on the number of transcripts of the corresponding genes in cells maintained in tap for 12 h




crmapk <dig> positively regulates the expression of crfox <dig> gene
the c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> strain was prepared by using the integrated fox <dig> promoter:ars box into the chromosome of the cc <dig> strain. under iron-deficient conditions, crfox <dig> promoted the ars reporter expression and appeared deep blue when this gene was mixed with xso <dig> substrate or yellow when this gene was mixed with p-nitrophenylsulfate. a total of  <dig> colonies were obtained after maa7ir/crmapk3ir was transformed into c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> and then transferred onto –fe plates with xso <dig> to determine the ars activities. only  <dig> colonies and the control sample of 2a <dig> appeared blue, whereas the  <dig> other colonies were colorless or light blue. furthermore,  <dig> % of chromogenic reactions indicated that crmapk <dig> silencing affected the fox <dig> promoter function in –fe. the transformants of rnai <dig>  rnai <dig>  and rnai <dig> appeared colorless in both + fe  and –fe except the non-transgenic c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> control, which appeared deep blue under –fe conditions . these results were further confirmed by the ars activity in transgenic strains. the ars activities of rnai <dig>  rnai <dig>  and rnai <dig> respectively decreased by  <dig>   <dig>  and 83% compared with those of the c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> control . the mrna of the ars <dig> of the transgenic stains decreased by more than 97% in –fe . the mrna levels of the target crmapk <dig> of the transgenic strains rnai <dig>  rnai <dig>  and rnai <dig> decreased remarkably by  <dig>   <dig>  and 98%, respectively . these data implied that crmapk <dig> silencing positively regulated fox1:ars expression. crmapk <dig> silencing also decreased the gene expression of endogenous fox <dig> in chlamydomonas. the mrna levels of crfox <dig> of the rnai <dig> strain decreased by  <dig>   <dig>  and 71% when this strain was cultured for  <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h under the –fe condition, respectively. crmapk <dig> silencing also repressed the iron-induced upregulation of crfox <dig> gene expression. therefore, crmapk <dig> positively regulated the endogenous expression of crfox <dig> .fig.  <dig> analysis of crmapk <dig> rnai transgenic algal strains. of the  <dig> crmapk <dig> rnai transformants,  <dig> were colorless or light blue. among them, the ars activities of transgenic strains rnai <dig>  rnai <dig>  and rnai <dig> were significantly decreased under − fe . moreover, the mrna levels of ars were significantly decreased . the mrna level of target gene crmapk <dig> was decreased by 97–98% compared with the control , indicating that crmapk <dig> in transgenic strains of rnai <dig>  rnai <dig>  and rnai <dig> has been effectively silenced. the mrna levels of endogenous crfox <dig> were reduced by  <dig>   <dig>  and 71%, respectively, at  <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h post-incubation in –fe, indicating that crmapk <dig> positively regulates the expression of crfox <dig> gene . the data are shown as the means . significance is indicated as *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 




crmapk <dig> positively regulates the expression levels of iron uptake-associated genes

chlamydomonas exhibits an iron uptake pattern similar to type i plants. during iron deficiency, chlamydomonas cells undergo the affinity iron absorption mechanism by inducing the expression of crfox <dig>  <cit> , crnramp <dig>  <cit> , cratx <dig>  <cit> , crftr <dig>  <cit> , and crfea <dig> to enhance iron absorption  <cit> . crfea <dig> is located in the cell walls and responsible for the transport of reduced fe2+ via fre <dig>  to crfox <dig>  which is found in the plasma membrane , and reoxidizes fe2+ to fe3+. crfox <dig> is then transported inside the cells through the plasma membrane protein crftr <dig>  and atx <dig> of yeast transports cu2+ to the cytoplasm. thus far, direct evidence supporting iron transmission has yet to be obtained, but studies have shown that atx <dig> is an iron-deficiency-inducible protein. the nramp gene family is located on the vacuole membrane, and it shuttles fe2+ between vacuole membranes to maintain the iron concentration in the cytoplasm. the mrna levels of iron absorption-related genes, such as crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  in the crmapk <dig> rnai transgenic strain rnai <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  the mrna levels of the genes decreased after the strains were cultivated for 48 h under –fe. the mrna level of crnramp <dig> was decreased by 86% compared with the control after cultivation for 48 h in –fe. similarly, the mrna levels of cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig> were decreased by  <dig>   <dig>  and approximately 53%, respectively. these results indicated the association of crmapk <dig> of chlamydomonas with the iron metabolism-related genes. in the crmapk3-silenced strain rnai <dig>  the mrna levels of the genes, including crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  were also decreased when the mrna level of crmapk <dig> was decreased. thus, crmapk <dig> might positively regulate the expression of iron-uptake-associated genes, such as crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig> fig.  <dig> mrna expressions of iron absorption-related genes in crmapk <dig> rnai transgenic strain rnai <dig> in –fe. in the crmapk3-silenced strain rnai <dig>  the mrna levels of genes, including crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  were decreased when the mrna level of crmapk <dig> was decreased and after they were incubated with –fe after 48 h. this finding indicated that crmapk <dig> may positively regulate the expression of iron uptake-associated genes, such as crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  the data are shown as means ± sd . significance is indicated as *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 




discussion
mapks are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms, such as yeast, humans, and plants, and are involved in phosphorylation signaling cascades in extracellular amplification and intracellular transduction  <cit> . the mapk pathway is responsive to biological and non-biological stress stimuli, hormones, or growth factors and to cell division and apoptosis. moreover, the mapk pathway comprises mapkkk, mapkk, and mapk and amplifies signals via subsequent phosphorylation by using protein kinases and by migrating to the nucleus; thus, the extracellular stimuli of membrane receptors are connected to the molecular effectors of the cytoplasm and the nucleus  <cit> . a few mapks, including  <dig> in arabidopsis,  <dig> in rice,  <dig> in corn,  <dig> in aspen ,  <dig> in tobacco,  <dig> in tomato, and  <dig> in apple, have been identified . proteins encoded by mapks in different species contain various domains. in chlamydomonas,  <dig> of tey,  <dig> of tdy,  <dig> of tsy,  <dig> of tpy, and  <dig> of tty exist. in arabidopsis,  <dig> of tdy and  <dig> of tey are present. these diversities of types and kinase domains demonstrate that mapks participate in many metabolic activities. through cluster analysis, we found that tdy and tey of chlamydomonas kinases are highly homologous to those of arabidopsis kinases possibly because only tdy and tey domains are found in arabidopsis. other domains are highly similar to human kinases.

organisms need iron for respiration, dna synthesis, and enzyme reactions. transport systems have been developed for iron absorption because iron balance is vital. iron regulation, especially iron absorption and transportation, has been extensively investigated, but iron signal response systems have been rarely explored. iron deficiency in humans causes iron deficiency anemia and adolescent iron deficiency  <dig> syndrome. iron is an important element required by the body; excessive or scarce amounts of iron likely cause metabolic disorders; therefore, organisms should have a sophisticated control system to regulate the dynamic balance of iron elements  <cit> .

iron deficiency is the third-most important limiting factor of plant growth and yield in agriculture. photosynthetic plants reduce their chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis rate under iron-deficient conditions.

in humans, iron deficiency causes anemia. conversely, excess iron increases the risk of liver disease, heart attack, and hypothyroidism. iron is also a limiting factor in the growth of some tumor cells, and iron chelators are used clinically to inhibit tumor cell growth. furthermore, studies on iron mapk signal cascades have focused on human cancers. iron deficiency inhibits the mitosis of lung carcinoma cells, melanoma cells, and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor cells and thus induces cell apoptosis . therefore, iron chelators, desferrioxamine , and dp44mt are used to treat these cancers clinically  <cit> . iron deficiency signals are also transduced through the activation of jna and p <dig> by ask <dig>  to regulate the suspension of the mitotic activity and apoptosis of cancer cells  <cit> .

plant mapk gene responses to various stresses have also been detected. in our study, gene expression analysis revealed that  <dig> mapk genes in chlamydomonas were involved in response to stress. during iron deficiency,  <dig> mapk genes, including crmapk <dig>  were upregulated. therefore, crmapk <dig> possibly responded to iron regulation. these findings were further verified by silencing crmapk <dig>  and our results demonstrated that the mrna levels of fox1-ars, the enzyme activities of ars, and the endogenous mrna level of crfox <dig> decreased. therefore, crmapk <dig> positively regulated crfox <dig> expression. the mrna levels of –fe-inducing genes, including crnramp <dig>  cratx <dig>  crftr <dig>  and crfea <dig>  and the expression of crmapk <dig> were reduced. these findings confirmed that crmapk <dig> positively regulated the expression of iron-absorption genes. however, the exact proteins upstream and downstream of crmapk <dig> should be identified to reveal the mapk pathway of iron deficiency response in chlamydomonas.

methods
algal strains and culture conditions

c. reinhardtii cc <dig>  was purchased from the chlamydomonas genetics center at duke university. c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> is a transgenic strain with an integrated fox <dig> promoter:ars chimeric gene in c. reinhardtii cc <dig> genome. under iron-deficient conditions, the crfox <dig> promoter in 2a <dig> strain stimulated the ars gene expression and appeared blue when the xso <dig> substrate was added. liquid cultures were grown in the tap medium at 26 °c with agitation at 220 rpm under 110 μmol⋅m−2s− <dig> of continuous light for 3 days and then to the tap, tap-fe, tap-n, or tap + 150 mm nacl media for various time periods . total rna was extracted to prepare cdna for gene cloning and real-time pcr assay. all chlamydomonas strains were cultured in the tap or deficiency medium of tap with hunter’s trace element mix.

bioinformatics analysis of mapk gene family of chlamydomonas

chlamydomonas mapk homologous genes were retrieved from chlamydomonas database  by using the blast of arabidopsis mapk. multiple sequence alignments were generated using clustalx  <dig>  and mega <dig>  the following parameters were predicted: molecular weights and isoelectric points of proteins in expasy ; protein structures in smart; and conserved protein motifs in prosite  and meme . the structures of crmapk genes were generated online by using the gene structure display server  , and the homologous chromosome segments were detected using a synteny plot in plaza . the crmapk genes were subjected to blast analysis in plaza, and their duplication patterns were detected using a synteny plot. the subcellular localization of chlamydomonas mapks was performed using euk-mploc <dig>  .

construction of crmapk <dig> rna interference vector and transformation of chlamydomonas
using chlamydomonas cdna as a template, we amplified the fragments through pcr with forward primer crmapk3-f: cgtccgcaaaagacagtgta and reverse primer crmapk3-r: cttcgtctaccaggtgctcc. we then inserted the amplified fragments into pmd18-t vector to generate crmapk3-18 t, which was further digested with hindiii and bamhi and ligated into the intermediate vector t <dig> to produce crmapk3-t <dig>  crmapk3-t282-crmapk <dig> with inverted repeat sequence of crmapk <dig>  was developed by digesting crmapk3-18 t and crmapk3-t <dig>  crmapk3ir was inserted into ecori-digested pmaa7/xir to produce maa7ir/crmapk3ir. maa7ir/crmapk3ir was then transformed into c. reinhardtii 2a <dig> by applying the glass bead procedure  <cit> .

ars  activity detection
ars activity was determined as described by davies and grossman  <cit> . xso <dig>  was added to plates with –fe tap solid medium and scribed before clones were inoculated. after 1 day, the transformants that expressed ars activity were identified using blue halos around their colonies. the cells were initially collected by centrifugation to quantify the ars activity. the supernatant was mixed with  <dig>  m glycine–naoh at ph  <dig> , 10 mm imidazole, and  <dig>  mm p-nitrophenyl sulfate. the reaction mixture was incubated at 27 °c for 30 min. the reaction was terminated by adding  <dig>  m naoh, and its absorbance at 410 nm was determined. a standard curve of p-nitrophenol  was obtained using  <dig>  m naoh.

CONCLUSIONS
