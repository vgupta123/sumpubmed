BACKGROUND
bacteriophages are attractive as therapeutic agents because they are safe for humans and highly specific and lethal to the bacteria they target. further, phages can be developed rapidly to combat the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . phage therapy is currently practiced routinely and successfully in countries such as poland and russia  <cit> . the recent approval of commercial phage preparations by the united states food and drug administration to prevent bacterial contamination of meat and poultry  <cit>  may pave the way for the global use of phage therapy to control bacteria in human infections.

the development of phages for therapy has been hampered by concerns over the potential for immune response, rapid toxin release by the lytic action of phages, and difficulty of dose determination in clinical situations  <cit> . phages multiply logarithmically in infected bacterial cells, and the release of progeny phage occurs by lysis of the infected cell at the end of the infection cycle, which involves the holin-endolysin system  <cit> . holins create a lesion in the cytoplasmic membrane through which endolysins gain access to the murein layer  <cit> . endolysins are peptidoglycan hydrolases that degrade the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and release of progeny phages  <cit> . an undesirable side effect of this phenomenon from a therapeutic perspective is the development of immunogenic reactions due to large uncontrolled amounts of phages in circulation  <cit> . such concerns must be addressed before phage therapy can be widely accepted  <cit> .

this work features engineered bacteriophages that are incapable of lysing bacterial cells because they lack endolysin enzymatic activity. we previously produced, as a model, a recombinant lysis-deficient version of t <dig> bacteriophage that infects escherichia coli  <cit> . phages have also been engineered to be non- replicating or to possess additional desirable properties  <cit> . in an experimental e. coli infection model, the improved survival rate of rats treated with lysis-deficient t4lyd phage was attributed to lower endotoxin release  <cit> .

we wished to generate an endolysin-deficient phage against a gram-positive bacterium, and chose s. aureus because of its clinical relevance. s. aureus is a major pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from minor skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as sepsis. this pathogen is often resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics; vancomycin-resistant strains may become untreatable  <cit> . this organism is the most common cause of nosocomial infections, and nasal carriage is implicated as a risk factor  <cit> . in the united states alone, invasive methicillin-resistant s. aureus  infections occur in approximately  <dig>  people each year, causing nearly  <dig>  deaths  <cit> . understandably, the progressive multidrug resistance of bacteria has motivated the re-evaluation of phages as therapy for diverse bacterial infections  <cit> .

we report here that the recombinant endolysin-deficient s. aureus phage p <dig> kills cells without causing cell lysis and forms plaques on a host that expresses a plasmid-encoded heterologous endolysin, enabling its large-scale production. the recombinant phage p <dig> was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in an experimental mouse model and found to protect mice from fatal s. aureus infection.

methods
bacterial strains, plasmids, and growth conditions
e. coli strain dh5α  was used as host for plasmid constructions and plasmid propagation. a restriction-deficient prophage-free s. aureus strain rn <dig>  <cit>  was used for recombination, lysogenization, and phage enrichment. clinical isolates of s. aureus were used to test phage sensitivity. a mrsa clinical isolate  was used in animal experiments to determine the in vivo efficacy of the endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> 

the plasmid pet21a  was used for cloning and construction of endolysin disruption cassette. the plasmid psk <dig>  an e. coli - s. aureus shuttle vector containing puc <dig> cloned into the hindiii site of s. aureus plasmid pc <dig>  <cit> , was used as a source for the cat gene. a shuttle vector containing the temperature-sensitive replication origin of s. aureus, pcl <dig> , was used as source for the replication origin  <cit> . the constitutive bacillus subtilis vegii promoter was derived from prb <dig>  <cit> . all bacterial strains were cultured in liquid luria bertani  medium at 37°c on a rotary shaker  unless otherwise stated. ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were used as needed. all chemicals were obtained from sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa unless otherwise mentioned.

propagation, concentration, and enumeration of bacteriophages
bacteriophage p <dig> is a temperate phage that was isolated from the ganges river  and amplified in s. aureus strain rn <dig>  briefly, s. aureus rn <dig> was grown at 37°c in lb medium to an absorbance of approximately  <dig>  at  <dig> nm, infected with phage p <dig> at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> , and cultured at 37°c until the culture lysed completely. after centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min to remove cell debris, the bacteriophages were concentrated by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min. the bacteriophage titer was determined by enumerating plaque-forming units  in serial 10-fold dilutions in lb medium and confirmed by the agar overlay method  <cit> .

preparation of phage p <dig> dna and genome sequencing
phage p <dig> dna was prepared from a stock solution . the concentrated phage preparation  was incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hr with dnase i  and rnase a . the mixture was adjusted to contain 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate,  <dig> mm edta , and  <dig>  μg proteinase k and incubated at 65°c for  <dig> min. the mixture was then subjected to phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol  extraction, and the dna was precipitated  <cit> . purified phage dna was used for genome sequencing .

construction of plasmids for phage p <dig> endolysin disruption
the phage p <dig> endolysin gene  was amplified as two separate fragments by polymerase chain reaction . the first fragment  was amplified with forward primer 5'-cggaattccatatgaaaacatacagtgaagcaagagca-3', containing an ndei restriction site, and reverse primer 5'-ccgccgctgaattctaataaagtgagtacagcc-3', containing an ecori site. the fragment was cloned into a pet21a vector at the ndei/ecori sites.

the second fragment  was amplified with forward primer 5'-ccgccgggaattcagtataaaagtgagggctta-3', containing an ecori site, and reverse primer 5'-ccaagcttttaaaacacttctttcacaatcaatctctc-3', containing a hindiii site. the second fragment was cloned in tandem with the first fragment, thus generating the full-length phage p <dig> lysin gene with an internal ecori site. the cat gene was isolated along with its constitutive promoter from the s. aureus - e. coli shuttle plasmid psk <dig> by clai digestion. cohesive ends were filled with the klenow fragment of dna polymerase i and ligated into the blunted ecori site of the full-length phage p <dig> endolysin gene, thereby disrupting it. the s. aureus-specific temperature-sensitive origin of replication from the shuttle vector pcl <dig>  was introduced at the xhoi restriction site of this construct to generate pgmb <dig> 

mitomycin c induction of phage p <dig> lysogens
the s. aureus rn <dig> lysogen of phage p <dig> was inoculated in lb medium and incubated at 37°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hr. the cells were then subcultured in lb medium at 2% inoculum and incubated at 37°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm until the culture attained an absorbance of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. mitomycin c was then added to a final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml, and the culture was incubated at 37°c with shaking at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> hr for prophage induction.

recombination and screening for recombinants
s. aureus rn <dig> cells were transformed with pgmb <dig> by electroporation according to the protocol described by schenk and laddaga  <cit>  with a biorad gene pulser, plated on lb agar containing chloramphenicol , and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> hr. chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were selected and grown in lb at 37°c until the cultures reached an absorbance of  <dig>  at  <dig> nm. recombination was then initiated by infecting these cells with phage p <dig>  for  <dig> min. progeny phage were harvested from the lysate as described previously, lysogenized in s. aureus rn <dig>  and plated on lb agar containing chloramphenicol  . ninety-six chloramphenicol-resistant colonies were picked up, grown, and induced with mitomycin c. cultures that did not lyse after the 16-hr mitomycin c induction were treated with 1% chloroform and lysed with glass beads; the released phages were again lysogenized in s. aureus rn <dig> . chloramphenicol-resistant colonies of round ii lysogens were similarly grown and subjected to mitomycin c induction. the chloramphenicol-resistant lysogens that did not release phages upon mitomycin c induction were selected for pcr analysis. genomic dna of the selected lysogens was purified, and pcr was performed with different sets of primers to confirm disruption of the phage p <dig> endolysin gene.

endolysin complementation for phage enrichment and enumeration
the endolysin gene from a podoviridae phage in our collection, p <dig>  was cloned under the constitutive b. subtilis vegii promoter in an e. coli - s. aureus shuttle vector constructed in our laboratory. this construct, designated pgmb <dig>  was used for trans-complementation of the nonfunctional endolysin for propagation of the recombinant phage in lytic mode and for their enumeration. plasmid pgmb <dig> was introduced into s. aureus strain rn <dig> by electroporation according to the protocol described by schenk and laddaga  <cit> . transformants were selected on lb medium containing tetracycline  and used as bacterial hosts for phage enrichment. early log phase cells of s. aureus rn4220/pgmb <dig> grown at 37°c were infected with the recombinant endolysin-deficient phage p <dig>  and incubated for an additional  <dig> to  <dig> hr until the culture lysed. the phage-containing lysate was passed through a  <dig> -μm filter, and the phages were enumerated on a lawn of s. aureus rn4220/pgmb <dig> cells.

the endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> was also enriched by induction. briefly, the lysogen was grown at 37°c until absorbance at  <dig> nm reached  <dig>  and then induced with  <dig> μg/ml mitomycin c at 37°c for  <dig> hr. the cells were pelleted and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min, and the phage-containing supernatant was passed through a  <dig> -μm filter.

comparison of in vitro bactericidal activity of parent and lysis-deficient phage p954
the parent and recombinant phages were compared for host range and bactericidal activity. ten moi equivalent of phage was added to  <dig> ×  <dig> colony-forming units per ml  and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> min. serial 10-fold dilutions of the mixture were plated on lb agar, and residual viable cells  were enumerated.

in vivo efficacy of endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> in neutropenic mice
animal experiments were performed at st. john's medical college and hospital, bangalore, india. the experiments were approved by the institutional animal ethics committee and the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals .

healthy male swiss albino mice  were used to evaluate in vivo efficacy. neutropenia was induced by intraperitoneal  administration of cyclophosphamide . in a preliminary study, the lethality of a clinical mrsa isolate  was determined in the mice . we found that  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu resulted in 80% mortality , and it was therefore chosen as the challenge dose to evaluate phage efficacy .

in the efficacy experiment, mice were assigned to six treatment groups . four days after cyclophosphamide treatment, the mice in groups 1- <dig> were challenged with b <dig> . groups  <dig> and  <dig> were then treated with  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  ; groups  <dig> and  <dig> were treated with two doses of endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> prepared in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  at  <dig> moi equivalent ; and groups  <dig> and  <dig> were treated with two doses of chloramphenicol . the first treatment dose was administered immediately after challenge; the second dose was administered  <dig> hr later. mice were observed over  <dig> days for occurrence of mortality. survival analysis is plotted as kaplan-meier survival curves using medcalc statistical software version  <dig> . <dig>  .

RESULTS
genome of phage p954
the 40761-bp phage p <dig> genome  is composed of linear double-stranded dna with a g+c content of  <dig> % . blastn  <cit>  searches with the phage p <dig> nucleotide sequence showed it to be similar to other sequenced staphylococcal phages in the ncbi database. the p <dig> genome matches that of s. aureus phage phinm <dig>  with pair-wise identity of 66%. at least  <dig> open reading frames  were predicted with the genemark program  <cit> . bioinformatics analysis revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> orfs are hypothetical/conserved hypothetical proteins; the other  <dig> orfs show a high degree of homology to proteins from other staphylococcal phages in the database. the lysis cassette of this phage was found to be similar to lysis systems of other staphylococcal phages. the closest match to the phage p <dig> holin gene was staphylococcal prophage phipv <dig>  with 97% identity. the endolysin gene of phage p <dig> is 100% identical to the amidase gene from staphylococcal phage phi13; the phage p <dig> integrase gene is 100% identical to orf  <dig> of staphylococcal phage 85; and the phage p <dig> repressor gene is 100% identical to the putative phage repressor of s. aureus subsp jh <dig>  our analysis did not reveal the presence of any toxin encoding genes in the phage p <dig> genome.

screening of recombinants
the native phage endolysin gene was inactivated, and the recombinant phage engendered by homologous recombination between phage p <dig> and plasmid pgmb <dig> in s. aureus rn <dig>  screening for s. aureus rn <dig> lysogens harboring recombinant phage p <dig>  in which endolysin was inactivated by insertion of the cat gene, was carried out using chloramphenicol resistance as a marker. ninety-six colonies were obtained of which two lysogens did not show lysis with mitomycin c induction for up to  <dig> hours. phages mechanically released from these colonies upon relysogenization yielded chloramphenicol resistant lysogens that did not lyse upon mitomycin c induction. pcr analyses using two primer sets confirmed disruption of the endolysin gene in all the recombinant lysogens screened. representative pcr profile of recombinant and parent phage lysogens is shown .

mitomycin c induction of parent and endolysin-deficient phage p954
we examined the prophage induction pattern and phage progeny release from parent and endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> lysogens. absorbance and extracellular phage titers were monitored every hour until the end of induction. induction of the parent phage p <dig> lysogen  resulted in cell lysis and gave a phage titer of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml. in contrast, the endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> lysogen did not lyse and gave a phage titer of about  <dig> pfu/ml .

endolysin complementation for phage enrichment and enumeration
endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> could be enriched to titers of up to  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml in s. aureus rn <dig> that constitutively expressed phage p <dig> endolysin. this strain was used also to determine titers of the endolysin-deficient phage preparations. when preparations of the endolysin-deficient phage were spotted on a non-complementing host, a zone of lysis characteristic of "lysis from without" was observed at lower dilutions, and no plaques were discernible . the recombinant phage formed plaques only on the endolysin-complementing host .

comparison of in vitro bactericidal activity of parent and lysis-deficient phage p954
parent and recombinant endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> demonstrated comparable bactericidal activity when tested on a panel of seven phage-sensitive and one phage-resistant  clinical isolates, comprising both methicillin-sensitive s. aureus  and mrsa strains, from our collection. cell viability was reduced by ≥ 90% with both phages . similarly, the host range of each phage was the same on a panel of  <dig> phage-sensitive and phage-resistant clinical isolates .

in vivo efficacy of endolysin-deficient phage p954
an ip injection of the mrsa isolate b <dig>  resulted in the onset of disease in 80% of mice , indicated by dullness, ruffled fur, and death within  <dig> hr . however, ip administration of endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> as two doses  post b <dig> challenge fully protected the mice against lethality . similarly, chloramphenicol  protected mice against lethality ; however, one animal died in each of the chloramphenicol treatment groups of unknown causes . endolysin-deficient phage alone was not toxic or lethal to neutropenic mice, demonstrating its safety . endolysin-deficient phage demonstrated significant efficacy against mrsa b911in the tested animal model .

discussion
bacteriophage endolysins are peptidoglycan hydrolases that function at the end of the phage multiplication cycle, lysing the bacterial cell and releasing new phages to infect other bacteria. many efforts to develop therapeutic phages have focused on the lytic endpoint of phage infection to destroy the bacterium. however, cell lysis by phage may present the problem of endotoxin release and serious consequences as known in the case of antibiotics  <cit> . antibiotic-induced release of lipotiechoic acids and peptidoglycan  in case of gram positive bacteria has been shown to enhance systemic inflammatory responses  <cit> . an endolysin-deficient phage does not degrade the bacterial cell wall, thus progeny are not released until the cell disintegrates or is lysed by other means. however, the phage protein holin, produces an inner membrane lesion at the end of the phage replication cycle, which terminates respiration  <cit>  and ensures killing of the cell. in an in vivo situation, we can expect such dead cells to be cleared rapidly by the host immune system.

non-replicating genetically modified filamentous phage which exerted high killing efficiency on cells with minimal release of endotoxin is reported  <cit> . higher survival rate correlated with reduced inflammatory response in case of infected mice treated with genetically modified phage  <cit> . a phage genetically engineered to produce an enzyme that degrades extracellular polymeric substances and disperses biofilms is reported  <cit> .

although temperate phages present the problem of lysogeny and the associated risk of transfer of virulence factors through bacterial dna transduction; we have used a temperate phage as a model for this study as the prophage status simplifies genetic manipulation. because s. aureus strains are known to harbor multiple prophages, which could potentially interfere with recombination and engineering events, we elected to lysogenize phage p <dig> in a prophage-free host, s. aureus rn <dig>  our strategy was to identify lysogens that harbored the recombinant endolysin-deficient phages, based on detection of phage p <dig> genes and the cat marker gene by pcr analysis .

in the recombination experiment, the  <dig> chloramphenicol resistant colonies obtained represented recombinant endolysin-inactivated prophage some of which lysed upon mitomycin c induction. we suspected that the parent phage could also have lysogenized along with the recombinant phage. we overcame the problem by repeating the induction of chloramphenicol resistant lysogens and lysogenization of the phages produced.

when we assessed the prophage induction pattern and phage progeny release of parent and endolysin-deficient phage p <dig> lysogens, we found that the absorbance of the culture remained unaltered and the extracellular phage titer was minimal with the recombinant phage lysogen. we observed a low phage titer  <dig> to  <dig> hours after induction, presumably due to natural disintegration and lysis of a small percentage of the cell population. in contrast, we observed lysis of the culture by the parent phage with increasing phage titer in the lysate, as expected .

complementation of the lysis-deficient phenotype was achieved using a heterologous phage p <dig> from our collection. supplying the endolysin gene in trans allowed the recombinant phage to form plaques . this was used to determine titers of the endolysin-deficient phage throughout our study, and provided an excellent method for efficient phage enrichment. use of a heterologous phage endolysin enabled the recombinant phage to exhibit the lysis-deficient phenotype even after several rounds of multiplication. in vitro activity of the endolysin-deficient phage against mssa and mrsa was comparable to that of the parent phage . further, the recombinant phage was able to rescue mice from fatal mrsa infection , similar to the parent phage . future studies will have to compare systemic responses and outcomes of treatment with native and endolysin- deficient phage in s. aureus infection.

this work demonstrates the potential of disrupting the endolysin gene to reduce the number of phages that are otherwise released post-infection by their lytic parent phage. in clinical situations, this would provide the advantage of a defined dosage, which is an important concern raised against phage therapy  <cit> , as well as lower immune response and reduced endotoxin release when using gram-negative bacteria. this is the first report of a gram-positive endolysin-deficient phage. our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of engineered phages in clinical applications.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed a modified bacteriophage against s. aureus by insertional inactivation of its endolysin gene, which renders it incapable of host cell lysis. this phage is lethal to cells it infects, with little or no release of progeny phage. we showed that the disrupted endolysin could be complemented with a functional heterologous endolysin gene to produce this phage in high titers. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a gram-positive endolysin-deficient phage. further, we demonstrate its therapeutic potential in an experimental infection model in mice, in which the lysis-deficient phage p <dig> protects against lethal mrsa.
