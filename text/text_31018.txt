BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cell cycle is precisely controlled and regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational level. to identify cell cycle regulated genes, several genome-wide analysis have been performed using microarray technologies  <cit> . in these studies, expression levels across the cell cycle were measured simultaneously for thousands of mrna transcripts. in order to identify the subset of periodically expressed genes in the resulting microarray gene expression time series data, a number of computational approaches have been proposed, including fourier analysis  <cit> , partial least squares regression  <cit> , fisher's g-test  <cit> , model-based method  <cit> , and methods using some threshold criteria  <cit> . these approaches provided useful tools for periodicity analysis in microarray time series data and have led to the identification of hundreds of cell cycle regulated genes. for example, spellman et al. found that about  <dig> genes are periodically expressed across the cell cycle in s. cerevisiae.

transcription factors  play critical roles in gene expression regulation. to understand how the cell cycle is regulated and how cell cycle regulates other biological processes, such as dna replication and amino acids biosynthesis, it is useful to identify the cell cycle regulated transcription factors . we note that in this paper we use the term "cell cycle regulated" rather than "cell cycle regulator" as used in previous studies, because it is often difficult to infer the direction of regulation only from the microarray cell cycle data. the transcription factors whose regulatory activities fluctuate periodically across the cell cycle could be either cell cycle regulator or effector of the cell cycle regulation. moreover, the expression levels of tfs in microarray data may not accurately reflect their activities in transcription regulation. first, tfs are often subject to various post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications, which abolish the significant correlations between their activities and expression levels. second, tfs are usually expressed in relatively low levels  <cit>  and therefore expression changes measured by microarray hybridization may not be accurate. therefore, identification of ccrtfs should be based on the activities of tfs rather than their expression levels. considering this issue and by integrating the microarray cell cycle data with tf-gene connectivity data from chip-chip experiment, several methods have been suggested to identify yeast cell cycle transcription factors  <cit> , to infer cooperativity among the transcription factors controlling the cell cycle in yeast  <cit> , to model the network of yeast cell cycle transcription factors  <cit> , or to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory modules of the yeast cell cycle  <cit> .

in this paper, we suggest a two-step method to identify the ccrtfs in yeast. first, for each tf we infer its activity in each time point of the microarray data, resulting in an activity profile for it. this is achieved by integrating microarray expression data with systematic chip-chip data  <cit>  or motif discovery data  <cit>  using the base method  <cit> . in the second step we use the fisher's g-test to examine the periodicity of these tf activity profiles to identify the ccrtfs. based on the combination of microarray data and chip-chip data, we identify  <dig> ccrtfs at 4% false discovery rate , including  <dig> experimentally validated cell cycle tfs. more importantly, by combining microarray expression data with in-silico motif discovery data, we identify  <dig> motifs with known associated tfs at  <dig> % fdr, among which  <dig> are associated with established cell cycle tfs. thus, our method is able to identify ccrtfs in species other than s. cerevisiae, in which microarray cell cycle data have been generated whereas large-scale chip-chip data are still not available.

RESULTS
periodic activity fluctuation of tfs across the cell cycle
we integrate the microarray cell cycle gene expression data with the chip-chip data to infer tf activities at  <dig> time points of the microarray data, resulting in  <dig> activity change score  profiles each corresponding to a tf. these ac score profiles measure the activity fluctuation of tfs at each of the  <dig> time points in the cell cycle. the ac score for a tf reflects the relative activity of this tf in the synchronized sample with respect to the non-synchronized control at a time point. for a transcription activator, a positive ac score indicates its activity enhancement and a negative ac score indicates its activity reduction. for a transcription repressor, the inverse conclusion should be made. see section "methods" for detail definition and calculation of ac scores. then average periodogram is applied to these ac score profiles and the original gene expression data  to investigate the existences of tfs that fluctuate periodically in the activity and in the expression level, respectively.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the average periodogram exhibits a dominate peak at the fourier frequency of  <dig>  in both the inferred ac score data  and the gene expression data , suggesting the existences of periodical components. the fourier frequency  <dig>  corresponds to the genuine frequency of the cell cycle, since the microarray data covers exactly two cell cycles by  <dig> time points. these results indicate that the existences of the cell cycle regulated tfs can be detected at both the activity level and the expression level. nevertheles, when we test the significance of periodicity for each of the tfs using the fisher's g-test, we find that much more tfs show periodic fluctuation in the activity level  than in the gene expression level . at the  <dig>  significance level, we identify  <dig> ccrtfs based on the inferred tf activity profiles, whereas only  <dig> tfs are found to be cell cycle regulated based on the original expression data. these results confirm our hypothesis that cell cycle regulation of tfs takes place mainly at the activity level rather than at the gene expression level and as a consequence the ccrtfs should be be identified based on their activities.

we note that the original microarray cell cycle data contains four separate experiments, corresponding to four different cell cycle synchronization method: α-factor arrest, temperature arrest by cdc <dig> mutant, temperature arrest by cdc <dig> mutant, and elutriation, respectively. our analysis indicates that the α-factor arrest data achieves the highest quality, since the average periodogram for the inferred tf activity profiles from the other three data sets  exhibit one or multiple un-expected peaks, which may result from noise or the effect of synchronization treatment to the tf activities. therefore, in this paper we focus our analysis on the microarray cell cycle data synchronized by α-factor arrest.

cell cycle regulated tfs
we identify  <dig> ccrtfs that are periodically activated in a cell cycle dependent manner at the  <dig>  significance level, among which  <dig> have been experimentally verified according to previous studies  <cit> . the detail information for these ccrtfs is listed in table  <dig>  as shown, these ccrtfs include the well established cell cycle regulatory transcription factors: mbp <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig>  mcm <dig>  fkh <dig> and ndd <dig>  <cit> .

a: known ccrtfs are shown in bold; b: known phases of tfs; c: inferred phases for tfs by formula ; d: whether identified as ccrtfs in  <cit> 

in the  <dig> ccrtfs identified by our method,  <dig> have not been experimentally validated to be cell cycle regulated. but several of them have been reported as putative cell cycle tfs in several computational studies. for example, bas <dig> and gat <dig> have been identified as cell cycle tfs by tsai et al.  <cit> ; abf <dig>  gat <dig>  and nrg <dig> have been identified by wu et al.  <cit> ; hap <dig> has been identified by yang et al.  <cit> ; bas <dig> and spt <dig> have been identified by cokus et al.  <cit> . further investigation of these tfs might provide new insight into the mechanisms about how the cell cycle is regulated or how the cell cycle regulates other cellular processes. the yeast cell cycle can be divided into five different phases: m/g <dig>  g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m. in the microarray cell cycle data, each of the five stages corresponds to  <dig>  or  <dig>  time points. we calculate the average ac scores of each tf over the time points corresponding to a common phase as shown in table  <dig>  the phase-specific ac scores reflect the cell cycle behavior of a tf. for example, our results indicate that fkh <dig> achieves the highest activity at m phase  and the lowest activity at g <dig> phase ; hir <dig> achieves the highest activity at s phase  and the lowest activity at m/g <dig> phase ; mbp <dig> achieves the highest activity at g <dig> phase  and the lowest activity at m phase . all these inferences are consistent with the well established knowledge that fhk <dig>  hir <dig> and mbp <dig> are m phase, s phase and g <dig>  m phase specific transcription factor, respectively. moreover, we also estimate the active phase of each ccrtf using the statistical method described in subsection "phase estimation" of the "method". these  <dig> ccrtfs are categorized into  <dig> groups: k =  <dig>   <dig> ..., <dig>  the groups k =  <dig>   <dig>  the groups k =  <dig>   <dig>  the groups k =  <dig>   <dig>  the group k =  <dig>  and the groups k =  <dig>   <dig> achieve maximum activity at phase m/g <dig>  g <dig>  s, g <dig> and m, respectively. the statistically estimated phases for these  <dig> ccrtfs are also consistent with the established knowledge about these transcription factors. we apply clustering analysis to the inferred activity profiles of the  <dig> ccrtfs using the hierarchical clustering method  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the tfs that are activated in common phases of the cell cycle tend to be clustered together. for example, previous studies indicate that the complex sbf formed by swi <dig> and swi <dig> and the complex mbf formed by swi <dig> and mbp <dig> regulate the expression of late g <dig> genes  <cit> ; mcm <dig>  together with fkh <dig> or fkh <dig>  recruits the ndd <dig> protein in late g <dig>  and controls the transcription of g2/m genes  <cit> . consistently, as shown in figure  <dig>  swi <dig>  swi <dig> and mbp <dig> follow into the same cluster that exhibits the highest activity at phase g1; mcm <dig>  fhk <dig> and ndd <dig> follows into the same cluster that exhibit the highest activity at phase m. other than the hierarchical clustering, the above described phase estimation inherently provides a clustering method for the  <dig> ccrtfs, which categorize them into  <dig> groups: k =  <dig>   <dig> ..., <dig>  the image presentation of these  <dig> groups is shown in the supplementary documents .

our method fails to identify several known cell cycle tfs, including ace <dig> and fkh <dig>  it turns out that the activities of ace <dig> does fluctuate periodically across the cell cycle , but the period calculated by the periodogram is different from the genuine period of the cell cycle. for the fkh <dig>  although its activity profile shows an obvious fluctuation in each of the two cell cycles , the activities in the two cell cycles are not consistent with each other and thereby it fails to pass the fisher's g-test . this may be caused by noise or by the influence of synchronization treatment to the activity of transcription factors, which we will discuss in more detail in the next section.

influence of the cell cycle synchronization methods
in order to measure gene expression during the cell cycle, the yeast cells must be synchronized using certain techniques, such as α-factor arrest and temperature arrest. however, these synchronization techniques may perturb the cell status and result in activity modification of tfs  <cit> . as a consequence, the periodic activity fluctuation of some ccrtfs may be perturbed and can not be detected. figure  <dig> shows the effect of the α-factor to the activity of four different tfs. as shown in figure 4a–c, dig <dig>  ste <dig> and tec <dig> exhibit extraordinary high activities at the initiation of the time series after releasing from the α-factor arrest . for ace <dig>  although its activity is only moderately up-regulated at the initiation of the time series , the periodicity of its activity profiles is perturbed by the α-factor treatment. as shown in figure 4d, the activity profile of ace <dig> exhibits quite different patterns in the two consecutive cell cycles. in fact, dig <dig>  ste <dig> and tec <dig> are transcription factors that are activated by the map kinase signaling cascade and involved in the regulation of genes in mating or pseudohyphal/invasive growth pathways  <cit> . α-factor pheromone is the activator of the map kinase pathway  <cit> , so it is not surprising to see the up-regulation of dig <dig>  ste <dig>  and tec <dig> by the α-factor treatment.

according to previous studies, ste <dig>  tec <dig>  and ace <dig> are all regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner. however, the α-factor treatment used to synchronize the cell cycle perturbs the periodic activity fluctuation of these tfs in the cell cycle time series, and as a consequence these ccrtfs can not be identified by our method. the statistical method proposed by tsai et al. may avoid this problem, since it is not based on the test of periodicity  <cit> . according to their method, a tf is reported to be cell cycle regulator if the activity of the tf does not keep constant in the cell cycle and there exists at least one phase in the cell cycle where the tf is significantly up- or down-regulated. this method may result in some false positive findings. for example, the cell cycle regulator dig <dig> identified by tsai et al is obvious not a ccrtf according to its activity profile shown in figure 4a.

cell cycle associated regulatory motifs
tf activities in the cell cycle can be inferred by integrating the microarray expression data with systematic chip-chip data. for most species, however, the large-scale chip-chip data is still not available. in this case, how to identify the ccrtfs? here we provide an alternative strategy by identifying the cell cycle associated regulatory motifs. we first identify all the putative motifs that are significantly enriched in the promoter regions of all yeast genes. by integrating the systematic motif discovery data with the microarray cell cycle data, we calculate the ac score for each motif at each time point of the microarray cell cycle data. suppose that there exists a dna binding protein  for each motif, the ac score of a motif reflects the activity of its dna binding protein at a time point. we define a motif as cell cycle associated regulatory motif, if its ac score profile fluctuates periodically across the cell cycle.

we identify  <dig> putative motifs and calculate their ac score profiles in the cell cycle. figure 5a shows the average periodogram for the ac score profiles of these  <dig> motifs. as shown, it exhibits a dominate peak at the fourier frequency  <dig> , the genuine cell cycle frequency. we test the significance of periodicity for these profiles and the distribution of their p-values is shown in figure 5b. among these  <dig> putative motifs,  <dig> are found to be cell cycle associated at the  <dig>  significance level according to our analysis . in these  <dig> putative motifs,  <dig> can be associated with known tfs according to previous literatures, including  <dig> cell cycle tfs: ace <dig>  fkh <dig>  hir <dig>  mbp <dig>  mcm <dig>  ndt <dig>  rpn <dig>  skn <dig>  ste <dig>  swi <dig>  ume <dig>  and xbp <dig>  in the  <dig> motifs with known tfs,  <dig> are found to be cell cycle associated motifs according to our results. these  <dig> motifs are known to be regulated by mbp <dig>  swi <dig>  hir <dig>  ndt <dig>  rpn <dig>  skn <dig>  abf <dig>  and mcm <dig>  respectively. among them,  <dig> are experimental verified cell cycle tfs and the other one, abf <dig>  is reported to be cell cycle tf in the computational analysis performed by wu et al.  <cit> . detail information for these motifs is listed in the supplementary documents  and the inferred activity profiles of them are shown in figure  <dig>  note that we miss  <dig> cell cycle tfs: ace <dig>  fkh <dig>  ste <dig>  ume <dig>  and xbp <dig>  our analysis indicates that the activity of ace <dig> fluctuates periodically across the cell cycle , but the estimated fourier frequency is not equal to the cell cycle frequency. this is consistent with the result obtained using chip-chip data. for the other four missed cell cycle tfs: fkh <dig> , xbp <dig> , ste <dig> , and ume <dig> , the p-values from periodicity test are relatively small, although they do not pass our criteria. overall, these results suggest that our method is able to identify ccrtfs with high accuracy by integrating microarray expression data with the motif discovery data from pure in-silico sequence analysis.

discussion
to test whether a tf is cell cycle regulated, tsai et al. examine if there exists at least one phase in the cell cycle where the tf is significantly activated by comparing the expression levels of its target genes with those of non-target genes  <cit> . in this paper, we propose a two-step method: infer the activity profiles of a tf in the cell cycle and then test the significance of its periodicity. in comparison with the method suggested by tsai et al., our method has the following advantages:  it need not to pre-define the target and non-target gene sets for each tf based on more or less arbitrarily selected threshold setting and is thereby easier to be implemented;  it deals with tf activity perturbation caused by synchronization treatment in a more conservative manner, and thereby avoid some false positive findings;  it can detect the ccrtfs that are periodically but moderately activated during the cell cycle. on the other hand, there is also a limitation for this method: synchronization treatments may perturb the periodic activity fluctuation of some tfs and result in false negatives. in order to achieve more accurate results, it may be useful to combine these two methods. for example, after the implementation of our method, we can further examine the ac scores of those non-ccrtfs at the initial time point. if the initial ac score of a tf is significantly high or low, its activity may be perturbed by the synchronization treatment. we therefore exclude one or more initial time points and apply the tsai et al.'s method to the remaining time points to examine again whether it is cell cycle regulated.

several methods have proposed to infer the tf activities from microarray expression data by integrating it with chip-chip data or motif information  <cit> . all these methods assume a linear relationship between gene expressions and tf-gene binding affinities , motif occurrences, or motif matching-scores, which may not be valid considering the high complexity of gene transcriptional regulation. moreover, some of these methods, such as gnca, require a complicated pre-processing step and some constraints. in contrast, our method does not require the linear assumption and easy to be implemented. it is exciting to see that the ccrtfs can be identified with high accuracy by integrating microarray cell cycle data with the in-silico motif discovery data. microarray cell cycle data sets are available for several species, including fission yeast, mouse and human. on the other hand, systematic chip-chip data are still not available for most species other than the budding yeast. our method may be applied to the microarray cell cycle data in these species to identify the all the cell cycle associated regulatory motifs. then experimental techniques or computational methods can be used to associate these motifs with tfs. this may lead to systematic identification of the ccrtfs in these species.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present a method to identify ccrtfs by integrating microarray cell cycle data with systematic chip-chip data or motif discovery data. for each tf, the method infers its activity profile across the cell cycle and then tests the significance of periodicity of the profile. application of this method to the yeast microarray cell cycle data and the chip-chip data results in identification of  <dig> ccrtfs, among which  <dig> have been experimentally verified. importantly, reliable results are also achieved by integrating the microarray expression data with the in-silico motif discovery data. the method provides a useful tool to investigate the cell cycle transcriptional regulation, especially in those species where large-scale chip-chip data are not available.
