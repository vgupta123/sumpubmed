BACKGROUND
the principle of epistasis has been an important tool in functional genomics and genetics research for more than a century  <cit> . according to this principle, genes may be defined as epistatic to one another when the phenotypic impact associated with a given mutation is altered by the presence of a second gene mutation. by measuring epistasis scores, which quantify departure from a given neutrality model marking the absence of epistasis , it is possible to delineate genes functioning within common or parallel pathways and to infer regulatory hierarchies or functional complexes  <cit> . for example, aggravating interactions, which occur when the phenotypic impact of the double deletion is greater than predicted by neutrality, may result from the loss of compensatory pathways. alternatively, alleviating interactions, which occur when the phenotypic impact is less than expected, may indicate that genes function within a common pathway or complex.

while epistasis reflects the structure of genetic networks in a given environment, the sign and strength of these interactions are expected to change in accordance to the substantial changes in physical interactions observed in response to external perturbations . such changes are anticipated to reflect the activation or inactivation of different pathways across environments. indeed, it is has been well established that epistasis depends on both genetic and environmental contexts  <cit> . interestingly, while the phenotypic impact of a changing environment is extensively analyzed in studies of gene-drug and drug-drug interactions , the environmental modulation of epistasis between genes has received much less attention. importantly, the analysis of fitness phenotypes may not enable a focus on pathways responding to specific environmental perturbations if the mutant strains involved have fitness defects in both the presence and absence of the perturbation  <cit> .

to address this issue, we have developed a method from first principles to specifically identify pair-wise genetic interactions that change dynamically between environments. this analysis of gene-gene-environment interactions is similar to the generalization of epistasis in terms of three-dimensional genotopes  <cit> . we developed the method by explicitly incorporating environmental effects into the neutrality function used to identify epistatic relationships. it turns out that the derived neutrality function can be expressed in terms of sensitivity phenotypes. the method may thus be viewed not only as an identification scheme, but also as providing a formal basis for the sub-classification of fitness-based genetic interactions recently proposed by st. onge et al.  <cit> .

to explore the utility of sensitivity-based epistatic analysis, we examined two comprehensive saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets describing the phenotypic impact of single and double gene-deletion in the presence and absence of the dna-damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate . for the purpose of inferring transcriptional regulatory networks, we generated and analyzed  <dig> mutant strains carrying single- and double-deletions of  <dig> transcription factor  genes. these tfs were selected due to the availability of comprehensive datasets describing the impact of mms on their binding to downstream genes, as well as the genome-wide changes in mms-induced differential gene expression following tf deletion  <cit> . as a preamble, we derive the classical multiplicative neutrality function and perform a conventional fitness-based epistatic analysis to identify genetic interactions in the both presence and absence of mms. we also discuss in more detail why the results of a fitness-based epistatic analysis should not be used on its own to determine if a genetic interaction plays a role in a given cellular response. we then derive the sensitivity-based neutrality function by adopting the common assumptions that genetic and environmental perturbations can be treated equivalently  <cit> , and that gene-environment interactions should remain invariant across genotypes in the absence of context-dependent epistasis.

using the data obtained for single and double tf deletion mutants, we show that sensitivity-based epistatic analysis implicates a set of genetic interactions in the mms-induced dna damage response that is significantly different from that obtained using fitness phenotypes. notably, only ~50% of the interactions identified using fitness phenotypes are also among those identified using sensitivity. a direct quantitative comparison of the two sets confirms that the sensitivity-based analysis specifically identifies interactions that change between environments. to explore this further, we compare sets of sensitivity- and fitness-based genetic interactions with datasets generated by workman et al  <cit>  describing mms-induced differential gene expression and protein-dna interactions in the presence of mms. this comparison demonstrates that sensitivity-based epistatic analysis can improve the identification of environmental-dependant regulatory relationships within transcriptional regulatory networks.

to evaluate the utility of sensitivity-based epistatic analysis for the identification of functional relationships among dna repair genes, we analyzed a dataset generated by st. onge et al  <cit> . this dataset describes the phenotypic impact of mms treatment on  <dig> single and double mutants carrying deletions of  <dig> genes conferring resistance to mms. we demonstrate that hierarchical clustering of sensitivity-based epistasis signatures captures the composition and order of complexes and pathways with known roles in the dna damage response. we also show that a sensitivity-based approach performs better than a fitness-based analysis for the identification of multi-component protein complexes with known functions in drug-induced dna damage repair.

taken together, our results suggest that sensitivity-based epistatic analysis may provide a useful tool to map how environmental perturbations modulate the architecture of genetic networks and reveal new insight into the regulatory networks and pathways mediating cellular responses to changing environments.

RESULTS
fitness-based epistatic analysis
the identification of genetic interactions using fitness phenotypes is typically based on the expectation that the absence of epistasis is marked by the equality:

  w×w=w×w, 

where w, w, w and w are the fitness of the reference strain  and its single- and double-deletion derivatives, respectively. this relationship, which is attributed to fisher  <cit> , can be derived by comparing fitness defects caused by deleting gene x in the wildtype strain, defined by δw = w/w, and a strain in which gene y is also deleted, defined by δw = w/w. the equality in eq.  is then obtained by assuming that the fitness defect caused by the deletion of x is independent of the presence or absence of gene y, i.e., by setting δw = δw. defining fitness in terms of relative growth rates, eq.  predicts that the growth rate m of the double mutant strain in the absence of epistasis is given by:

  mexp=m×mm, 

where m, m and m are the growth rates of the wildtype and single mutant strains, respectively. the strength of an epistatic interaction can correspondingly be defined as the relative difference between the observed and expected double mutant growth phenotype:

  εfit=m−mexpmexp=m×mm×m− <dig>  

we refer to eq.  as the fitness-based epistasis score  since relative growth rate fitness and growth rates can be used interchangeably.

to conduct a fitness-based epistatic analysis, we measured the growth rates of  <dig> single- and double-deletion tf mutants in the absence and presence of mms . detailed results are provided in additional file  <dig>  among the  <dig> single mutant strains,  <dig> had growth rates significantly different from that of the wildtype strain . eleven of  <dig> tf mutants identified as mms sensitive in the study performed by workman et al.  <cit>  are also identified in our screen. the three mutants "missing" from our set  all have p-values just above threshold . despite using conditions and methods that are significantly different, the overlap is comparable to that between the workman study  <cit>  and one by begley at al  <cit>  where  <dig> of  <dig> strains were identified in both studies using the same approach.

fitness-based epistatic analysis can be performed using the measured single mutant growth rates directly  <cit> , or by estimating the expected phenotypic outcome of double gene deletion from pooled fitness measurements  <cit> . both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. while the former is associated with uncertainty arising from alterations in growth phenotypes during the strain generation procedure  <cit> , the latter requires a low frequency of growth defects and genetic interactions. since the frequency of statistically significant growth defects is high within the tf single mutant library, we employ a variant of the pooling method in which growth rates of the single mutant strains is estimated from the median double mutant growth rate corrected for the phenotypic impact of the second deletion . in most cases, the estimated single mutant growth rates obtained using this method is consistent with their directly measured values . however, certain strains  had deviations greater than 5%. this deviation could indicate a high number of epistatic interactions, or that a systematic bias was introduced during the generation of the double mutants. for example, the yap5Δ single mutant grew consistently slower than its double mutant progeny, suggesting that the mutant might carry a secondary mutation that is lost following mating. to mitigate the impact of such experimental uncertainties, we used estimated growth rates for the yap5Δ, sok2Δ and adr1Δ strains in our subsequent analyses.

the results of the fitness-based epistatic analysis are summarized in figures 2b and 2c. detailed results regarding f-scores obtained in both the presence and absence of mms, as well as their associated p values, are provided in additional file  <dig>  following strain generation, 316/ <dig> of the possible double deletion strains were obtained for analysis. figure 2b shows the histograms of f-scores for the corresponding tf-tf pairs in the presence and absence of mms, as well as  <dig> interactions identified when the criteria p <  <dig>  is used to reject the null hypothesis that epistasis is absent . as expected, the f-score distributions are centred at zero in both environments , and scores associated with identified interactions are located in the tails of these distributions. of the  <dig> interactions identified, a significant fraction  is identified in the presence of mms while the remaining interactions are identified only in its absence.

the association of genetic interactions with specific environmental conditions using f-scores does not necessarily support correct interpretations about their environmental dependency. for example, the identification of an interaction in both the presence and absence of mms does not inherently indicate an mms-independent relationship. while the interaction may be conserved across most environments, it could be of particular importance in a specific environment. for example, genetic interactions important for the maintenance of chromosome integrity in all environments may be critical for the repair of mms-induced dna damage. conversely, it should not be concluded that an interaction is important for the mms-induced response based on its identification exclusively in the presence of mms. several non-biological factors can contribute to a differential identification across different environments. for example, the true variance may by chance be over- or underestimated in one of the two environments. this may in turn cause the p value to be above its critical value in one environment and below it in the other. within our dataset, we found that the variance among replicates is increased in the presence of mms , which inevitably introduce a bias towards identifying interactions in its absence. for these reasons, it is not possible to conclude if a given genetic interaction plays a role in pathways responding to specific environmental perturbations based solely on the measurement of fitness in the presence of the perturbation.

quantifying gene-environment interactions
to derive a neutrality function that incorporates environmental effects, it is noted that the phenotypic impact of changing the environment should be independent of a gene deletion when the mutated gene is not involved in the cellular response to this change. the principle of epistasis can thus be extended to gene-environment interactions when it is assumed that genetic and environmental perturbations can be modelled equivalently with respect to their impact on fitness, an assumption frequently employed in chemical biology . to quantify the strength of gene-environment interactions analogously to that of genetic interactions, let the fitness defect caused by changing environment from e <dig> to e <dig> be given by δw = m/m in the presence of gene x and by δw = m/m in its absence. when mutating gene x has no impact on the environmental response, i.e. δw = δw, the absence of a gene-environment interactions is marked by the equality:

  w×w=w×w. 

equation  describes a neutrality function parallel to eq.  in which a genetic perturbation has been substituted by an environmental perturbation to identify an interaction between a gene and the environmental condition rather than between genes. using relative growth rate fitness, the expected growth rate of the mutant strain is in turn given by:

  mexp=m×mm. 

defining sensitivity as the ratio of growth rates in the two environments, s = m/m, the relative difference between the observed and expected growth rate of the doubly perturbed strain can be written as:

  εenv=m×mm×m−1=ss− <dig>  

we refer to eq.  as the environmental sensitivity score  since it quantifies the relative change in sensitivity to a new environment caused by a single genetic perturbation. neutrality between gene x and the environmental change is inferred when deleting the gene has no impact on sensitivity, i.e., when εenv =  <dig>  conversely, a non-zero es-score implicates the gene in the cellular response to the environmental perturbation.

to identify which of our tfs are involved within the cellular response to mms, we calculated es-scores for the  <dig> single mutant strains . seven of these mutants have p-values indicating a significant interaction , including rpn4Δ, which displayed the greatest effect , and adr1Δ, dal81Δ, fkh2Δ, swi5Δ, swi6Δ and pdr1Δ, which displayed mild effects . noticeably, all displayed fitness defects in the presence of mms . conversely, not all strains associated with a fitness defect in the presence of mms are accompanied by a high es-score. since the ratio of sensitivities in eq.  may be expressed as a ratio of fitness values between the two environments, the relative impact of the mutation must be different across the two environments for the es-score to assume a significant value. consistent with this interpretation, with the exception of rfx1Δ, the eight mutants that display fitness defects in the presence of mms but have low es-scores also display fitness defects also in the absence of mms .

sensitivity-based epistatic analysis
extending the definition of the es-score in eq.  to genetic backgrounds other than wildtype enables the identification of genetic interactions that change dynamically between environments. to demonstrate this, we note that the es-score associated with deletion of gene x, in a strain that lacks gene y is given by:

  εenv=m×mm×m−1=ss− <dig>  

in figure 3b, we illustrate that the es-scores associated with specific tf deletions can vary considerably in the presence of a second tf deletion. in the plot, we include only the tfs with a high number of fitness-based epistatic interactions to specifically highlight the variation of environmental sensitivity across different genetic backgrounds.

to derive a neutrality function that incorporates environmental effects, we impose the definition of epistasis by assuming that mutating gene y should not affect the phenotypic impact of mutating gene x when the two genes act independently. considering the impact on sensitivity following deletion of gene x as the phenotype preserved across different genotypes, it immediately follows from the equality εenv = εenv that the absence of epistasis is marked by a sensitivity-based neutrality function where:

  s×s=s×s. 

equation  is a direct analogue of the fitness-based neutrality function in eq.  and the strength of the interaction between genes x and y can correspondingly be quantified by the sensitivity-based epistasis score :

  εsen=s−sexpsexp=s×ss×s− <dig>  

where sexp is the sensitivity satisfying eq.  expected under the null hypothesis that epistasis is absent.

to compare and contrast the fitness- and sensitivity-based approaches, we identified the  <dig> most likely epistatic interactions using f- and s-scores, respectively. the results of sensitivity-based analysis are summarized in figure 4a, which displays the histograms of s-scores for all tf-tf pairs and the  <dig> interactions with the lowest p values. as in the fitness-based calculation, the s-score distribution is centred at zero  and s-scores associated with high-confidence interactions are located in the extreme tails of this distribution. of the  <dig> interactions,  <dig> have p values below  <dig> , while the remaining eight have p values between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the additional interactions are included only to allow for a comparison of interaction sets of equal size. interestingly, only half of the fitness-based epistatic interactions  are among those also identified using sensitivity phenotypes . when a p value of  <dig>  is used as the significance threshold,  <dig> of the  <dig> interactions are identified exclusively by the sensitivity-based method. sensitivity-based epistatic analysis thus provides a perspective on tf-tf interactions in the dna-damage response that is significantly different from that provided by fitness-based analysis.

to further explore the differences between the two methods, we plot in figure 4c the correlation between the absolute value of εsen and the absolute change in εfit across the two environments. this plot demonstrates that the strength of f-scores associated with interactions not identified by sensitivity vary little between the two environments. one example is the interaction between the cell cycle regulators swi <dig> and ash <dig>  which have a strongly alleviating interaction in both environments , but has a low s-score . in contrast to this, interactions identified solely by the sensitivity-based method involve an apparent change in the epistatic relationship between the two genes following mms treatment. an example includes the interaction between the homologues, ace <dig> and swi <dig>  which have well-documented overlapping functions in cell cycle regulation  <cit> . all interactions highlighted by the sensitivity-based method involve a marked change in f-scores between the two environments. for example, the four swi <dig> interactions identified by both methods have f-scores that are high in one environment and low in the other. this includes the interaction between swi <dig> and msn <dig> interaction, which is weak in the absence of mms  and strongly aggravating in its presence , resulting in a high s-score . thus, sensitivity-based epistatic analysis allows for an assessment of the dynamic change in epistasis following an environmental perturbation. this may improve the identification of context-dependent regulatory relationships among genes, as well as the association of proteins to physical complexes and pathways involved in the response to environmental change.

inferring regulatory relationships
to evaluate the utility of sensitivity-based epistatic analysis in identifying putative mms-dependent regulatory relationships, we compared sets of interactions identified by fitness- and sensitivity-based epistatic analysis to datasets generated by workman et al  <cit>  describing the loss of mms-induced differential gene expression following tf deletion, referred to as genetic buffering  <cit>  or regulatory epistasis  <cit> , as well as protein-dna interactions in the presence and absence of mms. to ensure a fair comparison, we used a set of sensitivity-based interactions identified with p <  <dig>  and two sets of fitness-based interactions identified in the presence of mms. the first containing  <dig> high-confidence  interactions with p <  <dig> , and the second containing  <dig> reduced-confidence  interactions with p <  <dig> . the results of this analysis are summarized in figure 5a.

we first evaluated if the three sets of genetic interactions are enriched in direct genetic buffering whereby the deletion of one tf causes the loss of mms-induced differential expression of another. within the buffering dataset, there is evidence for genetic buffering interactions between  <dig> of the  <dig> tf pairs tested . about one-third  of these direct buffering events are also identified by the sensitivity-based analysis corresponding to a significant  <dig>  fold enrichment . by contrast, the set of interactions identified using fitness phenotypes displays no significant enrichment over a random model . in other words, if genetic buffering of one tf by another is viewed as evidence for a putative regulatory relationship, the sensitivity-based analysis clearly outperforms a fitness-based model in identifying such interactions.

to determine which genetic interactions are supported by physical interaction data, we analyzed the workman protein-dna interaction dataset focusing on genes that are differentially expressed following mms treatment. we evaluated two scenarios where tf-dna binding might manifest as a genetic interaction in the presence of mms - the direct binding of one tf to another and the co-binding of two tfs to a common downstream gene. the analysis of direct binding to differentially expressed tf genes  provides evidence for putative regulatory relationships among  <dig> tf pairs. four of these interactions are also identified in sensitivity-based set of interactions corresponding to a significant  <dig>  fold enrichment . by contrast, neither of the fitness-based sets displays enrichment.

to investigate the second scenario, we implemented a two-step analysis. first, for each genetic interaction, we performed a hypergeometric test by counting the number of differentially expressed genes bound by each tf and the number of genes bound by both. here, the identification of differentially expressed genes uses a lower p-value  to reduce the false positive rate. within the set of interactions identified from sensitivity analysis, seven tf pairs display a significant enrichment in co-binding using a stringent cut-off of p <  <dig> . to evaluate if this number of interactions is greater than expected from a random model, we counted the number of genes bound by any combination of tf pairs using the same criteria. this identified  <dig> tf pairs that are significantly enriched in co-binding among the  <dig> pairs tested. a hypergeometric test of these frequencies indicates no significant enrichment . similar values are obtained for the fitness-based sets.

the most compelling evidence for the improved identification offered by sensitivity-based epistatic analysis is obtained by considering the totality of the workman data. when direct buffering, direct binding and shared target binding are all considered evidence for a putative regulatory relationship among tfs, nearly 50% of the interactions identified by using sensitivity phenotypes are supported by at least one line of evidence . by contrast, the sets of fitness-based interactions show no significant enrichment . some of the identified interactions are well established in the literature. one example is the interaction between fkh <dig> and swi <dig>  which, according to the saccharomyces genome database, share a number of genetic interactions with genes involved in cell cycle progression. fkh <dig> is essential for the correct cell cycle periodicity of swi <dig> transcription  <cit>  and has been reported to prevent swi5-specific activation of the cell cycle gene cts <dig>  <cit> . another notable example is the interaction between swi <dig> and rpn <dig>  which co-localize to several common genes and both buffers the mitochondrial dna repair gene din <dig>  <cit> . the tfs also share  <dig> of  <dig> genetic interactions with genes that have mms-specific phenotypes and documented roles spanning numerous dna repair modules, including homologous recombination and post replication repair  <cit> . existing genetic interaction data thus suggests that swi <dig> and rpn <dig> are functionally linked in the mms-response, in agreement with our observation of dynamic mms-dependent genetic interaction between these genes.

to further compare the two methodologies, we calculated the true- and false-positive rates at varying p value thresholds when direct buffering, direct binding and shared target binding are all considered as evidence for a putative regulatory relationship. the results, which are displayed in figure 5b, indicate that sensitivity-based analysis can improve the identification of regulatory relationships among tfs. specifically, the sensitivity-based method identifies a higher number of true positives than the fitness-based method at any false-positive rate. this improvement becomes more evident when the predictive value, defined as the fraction of correctly identified interactions, is plotted for p values usually considered to imply statistical significance . while the sensitivity-based method achieves a success rate of about 50% for p values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , the success rate associated with the fitness-based method at best is in the 25-35% range.

inferring functional complexes and pathways
to explore if sensitivity-based epistatic analysis can be used to identify functional complexes and pathways, we conducted hierarchical clustering of s-score profiles . clustering of s-scores calculated for the tf dataset did not yield meaningful results  presumably due to the diverse and only partially overlapping roles of the different tfs in the mms response. as an alternative, we analyzed a dataset generated by st. onge et al.  describing the fitness of  <dig> mutants carrying single- and double-deletions of  <dig> genes displaying fitness defects in mms.

the hierarchical clustering of s-scores, displayed in figure 6a, yields a grouping of the  <dig> genes that is consistent with known functional modules within the dna damage response. these include members of the rad <dig> epistatis group , which function within the post-replication repair  pathway  <cit> , the shu complex  involved in promoting the formation of homologous recombination repair  intermediates  <cit> , the rad <dig> epistatis group  involved in homologous recombination  <cit> , as well as the rtt101-mms <dig> ubiquitin ligase  <cit>  and the mus81-mms <dig> recombination factor  <cit> . as expected, the genes within these clusters have mms-enhanced alleviating interactions with one another .

interestingly, the sensitivity-based clustering places sgs <dig> within the rad <dig> epistasis group in agreement with previous findings  <cit> , but also appears to separate this group into two different components - one comprising rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig> and the other comprising rad <dig> and rad <dig>  the former group are members of the rad51-dependent hrr pathway and function in parallel with members of the shu complex to generate hrr intermediates processed by sgs <dig>  <cit> . the latter group is known to have additional functions in single stranded annealing not shared by the other members of the group  <cit> . it may therefore not be surprising that rad <dig> and rad <dig> cluster farther from the shu genes and that sgs <dig> clusters together with rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig>  it is, however, interesting that hierarchical clustering of s-scores may be able to resolve how the different groups of genes act together within the mms response. it is also interesting that the group comprising rtt <dig>  which is grouped with mms22-dependent repair in agreement with previous findings  <cit> , slx <dig>  cla <dig>  and mag <dig> display strong aggravating interactions with members of the group comprising sgs <dig>  the shu complex genes and the genes the in rad51-dependent and independent hrr. this suggests that rtt <dig>  slx <dig>  cla <dig> and mag <dig> may function in parallel to the main hrr pathway. in the case of slx <dig>  this is consistent with the finding that the slx <dig> and sgs <dig> are part of functionally redundant endonuclease complexes  <cit> .

the clusters obtained using s-scores differ from those obtained by st. onge et al  <cit>  using fitness-based epistasis scores. both analyzes correctly identify the functional relationships between rad <dig> and rad <dig>  all members of the shu complex, four members of the rad <dig> epistasis group , the linkages between rtt <dig>  rtt <dig> and mms <dig>  as well as those between mms <dig> and mus <dig>  however, the fitness-based clustering failed to reveal the functional relationship between hpr <dig> and members of the rad <dig> epistasis group , the involvement of rad <dig> and rad <dig> with other members of the rad <dig> epistasis group, as well as the upstream role of sgs <dig> in processing hrr intermediates generated by shu complex and the rad51-dependent hrr pathway. notably, while analysis of fitness phenotypes performed by st.onge et al identified an alleviating interaction between hpr <dig> and both rad <dig> and rad <dig>  the use of sensitivity-based clustering appears to better capture the interplay of hpr <dig>  with both the rad <dig> pathway , consistent with the observation of direct physical interactions between hpr <dig> and both rad <dig> and rad <dig>  <cit> .

to further compare the two methods, we evaluated their ability to correctly recover interactions among genes encoding multi-component protein complexes. within a positively regulated pathway where x acts upstream of y, deleting the upstream gene is expected to mask the phenotypic effect of deleting the downstream gene  <cit> . this phenotypic masking can be detected if wxy = wx or sxy = sx. in terms of epistasis scores, this corresponds to εfit = wwt/wy- <dig> when fitness phenotypes are used, and to εsen = εenv = swt/sy- <dig> when sensitivity phenotypes are used. for genes encoding different components of a physical complex, it is further expected that εfit = wwt/wx- <dig> and εsen = swt/sx- <dig>  corresponding to co-equivalence among mutant phenotypes. figure 6b compares the fitness- and sensitivity-based methods in recovering phenotypic masking among protein complex genes. we focussed on three putative multi-component protein complexes involving members of the rad <dig> epistasis group , the shu complex  and  <dig> members of the rad <dig> hrr pathway . the genes within each complex are annotated as interacting physically with one another according to the biogrid database  <cit>  and define a set of  <dig> directional interactions displaying phenotypic masking; two for each of the  <dig> gene pairs. full data is provided in additional file  <dig>  we defined phenotypic masking as an alleviating interaction  where the difference between respective single- and double- deletion mutants for fitness  or sensitivity-based | and Δthr y = |εsen-εenv|) measurements are below a certain threshold . by applying this approach to test for phenotypic masking between all  <dig> directional interactions, the sensitivity-based identification outperforms that based on fitness phenotypes . this is more clearly demonstrated in figure 6c, which shows the fraction of masking relationship recovered when Δthr is less than 10%. indeed, for Δthr =  <dig> , the sensitivity-based approach recovers 92%  of the predicted interactions, including those between rad <dig> and rad <dig>  all the members of the shu complex, as well as the putative complex involving rad <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig>  by contrast, the fitness-based approach recovers only the interactions among members of the shu complex, which accounts for less than 60% of the predicted relationships.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a method that extends conventional fitness-based epistatic analysis to specifically identify genetic interactions that are dynamically modulated in response to an environmental perturbation. the identification of such interactions may provide several advantages by allowing a focus on pathways responding specifically to a given environmental perturbation  <cit> . noticeably, within the tf dataset analyzed, as few as ~50% of the interactions identified using fitness phenotypes are also identified using sensitivity. these interactions represent linkages among transcriptional regulators that change in a response-specific manner. thus, combining the two approaches may enable the segregation of genetic interactions within pathways involved in specific cellular responses, and interactions associated with core processes preserved across environments. this conclusion is supported by the analysis of genome-wide profiling of mms-induced changes in transcription and protein-dna interaction data. this analysis demonstrates a clear enrichment in putative regulatory relationships among tf pairs identified by sensitivity-based epistatic analysis, a result not provided by the analysis of fitness phenotypes. moreover, our analysis of epistasis within known dna damage repair pathways confirms that quantifying the environmental dependency of genetic interactions can be used to associate genes with different functional groups, physical complexes and pathways. by applying this principle across a larger dataset encompassing additional environmental conditions, we anticipate that this methodology could aid in deciphering the dynamics of gene networks.

integrating physical and phenotypic data into comprehensive and accurate models of regulatory networks and pathways remains a major challenge in systems biology  <cit> . the mapping of biomolecular interactions and transcriptional profiling provide fundamental insight into the substantial remodelling of gene regulatory networks that take place following environmental perturbations. however, it is not always clear if and how observed changes in the physical interaction network manifest at the physiological level. this can be clarified using the phenotypic information provided by sensitivity-based epistatic analysis since the dynamically modulated interactions identified by this method are likely to reflect the remodelling of network architecture in response to environmental cues. as such, the method may have important applications in the inference and analysis of biological networks.
