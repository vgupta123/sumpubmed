BACKGROUND
cisplatin  is an effective antineoplastic agent in the treatment of various solid tumours  <cit>  including cancers of the ovary, testis, bladder, head, neck, lung, cervix, and endometrium  <cit> . nevertheless, its full clinical utility is limited due to some adverse side effects including acute renal failure. the major site of renal injury is the s <dig> segment of the proximal tubule, located in the outer stripe of the outer medulla of the kidney  <cit> . the production of reactive oxygen species  and oxidative stress in kidney have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cisplatin-induced renal injury  <cit> . it has been shown that superoxide anion   <cit> , hydrogen peroxide   <cit> , and hydroxyl radical   <cit>  are involved in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. in addition, it has been found that renal lipid peroxidation  <cit>  is increased and glutathione is decreased  <cit>  in this experimental model. the involvement of oxidative stress is further supported by the fact that the antioxidants melatonin  <cit>  and vitamins c and e  <cit>  prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. interestingly, overexpression of heme oxygenase- <dig> ameliorates  <cit>  and heme oxygenase- <dig> deficiency  <cit>  aggravates renal damage induced by cisplatin, supporting additionally the involvement of oxidant stress in this experimental model.

on the other hand, the role of reactive nitrogen species  and nitrosative stress has been less explored in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. in this context, it has been studied the role of nitric oxide  and nitric oxide synthase   <cit> . it has been found that the renal content of total nitrate/nitrite is increased in cisplatin-treated rats  <cit>  suggesting that •no production is enhanced in these animals. furthermore, the inhibition of nos by l-name  <cit>  or by aminoguanidine  <cit>  decreased renal damage induced by cisplatin, suggesting that •no is playing a toxic role in this experimental model. however, it is unknown if peroxynitrite , a rns that is generated by the reaction of •no and o2•-, is involved in the renal damage induced by cisplatin. it has been shown that onoo-, which is not a free radical, is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases  <cit> . onoo- can react with different biomolecules including amino acids such as cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, and tyrosine leading to changes in protein structure and function  <cit> . onoo- has been shown to cause lipid peroxidation, chemical cleavage of dna, and reduction in cellular defenses by oxidation of thiol pools  <cit> .

in this work, we studied if onoo- is involved in the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin by using  <dig> , <dig> -tetrakis  porphyrinato iron  . this compound is a water-soluble fe  porphyrin complex that catalyzes rapid isomerization of onoo- to nitrate  under physiologically relevant conditions   <cit> . the cytoprotective actions of fetpps have been characterized  <cit> .

RESULTS
body weight and urinary volume
body weight decreased  <dig> % in cisplatin  group on day  <dig> and fetpps tended to prevent this decrease in cis+fetpps group, however there was no significative difference between cis and cis+fetpps groups. body weight was similar in control , fetpps, and cis+fetpps groups. urinary volume was not significative difference among the four groups along the study and on day of sacrifice .

values are mean ± sem. n =  <dig>  groups with different letter are significantly different .

markers of glomerular and tubular damage
serum creatinine increased  <dig>  times and blood urea nitrogen  increased  <dig>  times in cis group compared to control one . fetpps prevented partially the increase in serum creatinine and bun levels in cis+fetpps group. cisplatin increased urinary excretion of total protein  and n-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase   . the increase in both parameters was prevented by fetpps in cis+fetpps group . serum creatinine, bun, and urinary excretion of total protein and nag were similar in ct and fetpps groups .

histological analysis
after three days of cisplatin-treatment, the epithelium from proximal convoluted tubules  showed cytoplasmic vacuolization, intracellular edema and extensive damage which affected  <dig> ± 4% of their surface area . the cisplatin toxic activity was higher in the straight portion of proximal convoluted tubules located in the inner area of the kidney cortex, where more than 90% of the epithelial surface suffered damage . interestingly, fetpps administration partially decreased the damaged area from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ± 6%  in proximal convoluted tubules  and from  <dig> ±  <dig> to  <dig> ±  <dig>  in the straight portion . the administration of fetpps did not produce any histological alteration in the kidneys . at the light microscopy level, glomeruli structure remained unchanged in all groups.

immunohistochemical localization of 3-nitro-l-tyrosine 
a strong 3-nt immunostaining was observed in the straight portion of the proximal convoluted tubules located in the inner area of the kidney cortex of cisplatin-treated rats . interestingly, in the cis+fetpps group, fetpps administration partially prevented the cisplatin toxic damage in the epithelium from the proximal convoluted tubules and its straight portion respectively, in coexistence with an evident decrease of 3-nt immunostaining .

discussion
cisplatin in an effective chemotherapeutic agent for a wide variety of tumors, nevertheless, nephrotoxicity is the major complication of this antineoplasic treatment  <cit> . the mechanism by which cisplatin causes renal damage is unclear, however, it has been postulated that oxidative stress is involved in this process  <cit> . the protective effect of overexpression of mn-sod  <cit>  or the in vivo administration of some antioxidants such as vitamins c and e  <cit> , melatonin  <cit> , or selenium  <cit>  in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity as well as the protective effect of tiron , pyruvate and catalase , and dimethylthiourea and thiourea  in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells  treated with cisplatin also strongly support the role of ros in cisplatin renal toxicity  <cit> .

in contrast the role of •no and rns in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity has not been completely established. it has been shown that the renal content of nitrate/nitrite is increased in cisplatin-treated rats suggesting that •no is increased in these animals  <cit> . in fact it has been shown that renal nos activity is increased in cisplatin-treated rats  <cit> . in addition, the following two experiments suggest a toxic role of •no on cisplatin-induced renal toxicity:  aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of inducible nos, decreased nephrotoxicity and prevented kidney lipid peroxidation and reduction of antioxidant enzymes induced by cisplatin  <cit> , and  the administration of n-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester , an inhibitor of nos, reduced renal and gastrointestinal toxicity along with a significant inhibition in lipid peroxidation induced by cisplatin  <cit> . in contrast, mansour et al.  <cit>  and li et al.  <cit>  have found that l-name administration resulted in no protection and saad et al.  <cit>  found that this nos inhibitor aggravates cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction. these data may suggest that •no is not playing a toxic role in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. the above mentioned disagreement justify the performance of additional experiments to clarify the role of nos and •no in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

on the other hand, •no is able to react with o <dig> •- to produce onoo-, which is a powerful oxidant more, reactive than its precursors, and has been implicated in an increasing list of diseases: hyperlipidemia  <cit> , alzheimer  <cit> , acute renal ischemia  <cit> , neurotoxicity induced by methamphetamine  <cit> , and diabetes  <cit> . the onoo- decomposition catalyst fetpps is a water-soluble fe  porphyrin complex able to block onoo- toxicity  <cit>  and to protect against toxic insults in several experimental models. in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats, massive production of •no and o2•- results in continuous formation of onoo- even several hours after ischemia-reperfusion insult  <cit> . significant reduction of 3-nt in brain sections and prominent neuroprotection was observed by fetpps   <cit> . in a model of sepsis induced by injection of endotoxin  in rats, fetpps prevented the accumulation of onoo- as measured by plasma rhodamine fluorescence and heart 3-nt staining  <cit> . interestingly, fetpps improved endotoxin-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction, which was associated with reduced degradation of nuclear factor kappa b inhibitory protein i-kappa-b, plasma tnf-alpha levels, and microvascular endothelial cell-leukocyte activation  <cit> .

in this work it was found that fetpps partially prevented the increase in bun and serum creatinine  and urinary excretion of nag and total protein  induced by cisplatin-treatment. the increase in urinary nag and total protein excretion could be associated with necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubules, the primary site of drug accumulation  <cit> . fetpps prevented these alterations induced by cisplatin. this may be secondary to the ability of fetpps to catalyze the decomposition of onoo- which could be responsible, at least in part, of the alterations induced by cisplatin. this ameliorative effect of fetpps was associated with the decrease in 3-nt staining suggesting that onoo- is involved in protein nitration in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity. it is known that another rns such as n2o <dig>  honoo, •no <dig>  <cit> , and nitryl chloride   <cit> , are involved in protein nitration. nitryl chloride is formed by the reaction of no2- and hocl-derived myeloperoxidase  <cit> .

studies in animals have established that tubular injury plays a central role in the reduction of glomerular filtration rate in acute tubular necrosis. two major tubular abnormalities could be involved in the decrease in glomerular fucntion in cisplatin-treated rats: obstruction and backleak of glomerular filtrate. the alteration in glomerular function can not be attributed to structural damage since glomeruli structure is normal in cisplatin-treated rats. the alterations in glomerular function in cisplatin-treated rats may also be secondary to ros  <cit>  which induce mesangial cells contraction, altering the filtration surface area and modifying the ultrafiltration coefficient, factors that decrease the glomerular filtration rate. in addition our data suggest that onoo- may also be involved in the glomerular alterations in cisplatin-treated rats.

the increase in renal onoo- induced by cisplatin may be secondary to the increase in •no and o2•- production. in fact, there are evidences of the renal increase in •no production in cisplatin nephrotoxicity  <cit>  and o2•- generation in cisplatin-treated llc-pk <dig> cells  <cit> . the o2•- increase in cisplatin-nephrotoxicity may be simply consequence of the mitochondrial dysfunction  <cit>  and the decrease in superoxide dismutase activity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
nitrosative stress is involved in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. the ameliorative effect of fetpps on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats was associated with the decrease in protein nitration suggesting that onoo- is involved in both protein nitration and nephrotoxicity in these animals.
