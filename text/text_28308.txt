BACKGROUND
annexins are an evolutionarily conserved multigene family with a broad taxonomic distribution ranging from prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, to vertebrates  <cit> . annexins are multifunctional proteins that contain the characteristic annexin repeat. the c-terminal core of a typical mammalian annexin consists of four annexin repeats, and each repeat is approximately 70-amino-acid-long. the annexin repeat comprises five short α-helices and usually contains a characteristic “type ii” motif  for binding calcium ions  <cit> . different annexins are thus distinguished by their highly variable n-terminal regions which are important bases for determining functional differences of family members  <cit> .

functionally, annexins are capable of binding negatively charged phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner and also possess protein domains implicated in diverse cellular functions such as exocytosis, actin binding, peroxidase activity, callose synthase regulation and ion transport  <cit> . furthermore, their association or insertion into membranes may be governed by a range of cellular states  <cit> . unique roles of plant annexins include ph-mediated cellular response to environmental stimuli, fiber elongation, abscisic acid  signal transduction, and osmotic stress tolerance  <cit> . therefore, annexins appear capable of dynamically linking calcium, redox and lipid signaling to coordinate development in response to the changing environment  <cit> .

in plants, annexins have been found in eudicot species including arabidopsis  <cit> , pea  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and tobacco  <cit> , as well as monocot species including rice  <cit> , maize  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . although evolved from a common ancestor, plant annexins are structurally different from their animal counterparts. plant annexins have only one or two conserved annexin repeats and have a shorter n-terminal region  <cit> . structurally, plant annexins have larger surface area due to extra grooves and clefts in contrasting to mammalian annexins, suggesting that plant annexins may have wider range of interaction partners and hence a broad range of cellular roles. in addition to calcium channel and actin binding activities, plant annexins have some motifs or residues suggestive of peroxidase and atpase/gtpase activit  <cit> . moreover, plant annexins also possess a variety of post-translational modification sites, at least some of which may act as important regulators for their function in calcium dependent signaling  <cit> .

as shown by many transcriptional analyses, many plant annexin genes are transcriptionally activated in response to various abiotic stresses and plant hormones. an alfalfa annexin gene , which can be activated by osmotic stress, drought and aba, was first reported  <cit> . subsequently, transcriptional induction of annexin genes by stress conditions such as drought, salinity, cold, heat, heavy metal and oxidative stresses or by phytohormones such as aba, jasmonic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid and auxin has been widely reported in many plants, including arabidopsis  <cit> , leaf mustard  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , rice  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and maize  <cit> .

known plant annexins are often differentially expressed at different developmental stages. specific cases were observed for annexin gene families in dicots such as arabidopsis  <cit> , leaf mustard  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and bell pepper  <cit> , in monocots such as rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . of particular interest is that plant annexins are usually prominent at apical cells undergoing polar elongation, such as root hairs, pollen tubes and fern rhizoids .

several plant annexin genes have been genetically studied. for example, two annexin genes in arabidopsis, termed atann <dig> and atann <dig>  regulate stress responses. while the atann <dig> and atann <dig> single mutants showed tolerance to drought and salinity, which was further enhanced in the double mutant, constitutively expressing annat <dig> sensitized plants to stress treatments . atann <dig> was specifically expressed in mature pollen, and silencing atann <dig> resulted in abnormal pollen grain and severe male sterility  <cit> . ectopic expression of bjann <dig>  a b. juncea annexin gene, in tobacco and cotton enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses and fungal pathogen attack  <cit> . down-regulating ghann <dig> in cotton inhibited cotton fiber elongation, presumably through decreasing calcium influx at apical cells  <cit> .

wheat is a cereal crop of immense agricultural importance. in contrast to rice, corn, cotton and other crops in which heterosis has been extensively exploited in breeding programs, utilization of heterosis in wheat is still situated in an initial stage  <cit> . recently, efforts to exploit wheat heterosis have made promising progress by combining recovery lines with thermosensitive genic male sterile  lines. this two-line system is advantageous over the cytoplasmic male sterility system for its broad donor of restoring ability, easy maintenance and multiplication  <cit> . transcriptome profiling studies revealed that genes associated with calcium signaling and cytoskeleton dynamics were compromised upon cold stress in the anther of the tgms lines  <cit> .

based on previous knowledge, we are interested in determining whether annexins are involved in regulating male fertility in wheat. thus far, comprehensive information about the annexin gene family in wheat and related species still remains unclear. in this study, we annotated and phylogenetically analyzed annexin genes in wheat and barley, which have probably diverged from the triticum lineage about  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , and in t. urartu and a. tauschii which are progenitors for the a and d genome of wheat, respectively. based on such information, we further performed detailed transcriptomic analyses of annexin genes in wheat. together, the results provided significant information for understanding the diverse roles of plant annexins and opened a new avenue for functional studies of cold induced male sterility in wheat.

RESULTS
identification of annexins from triticum aestivum, triticum urartu, aegilops tauschii and hordeum vulgare
we searched annexin genes systematically from available genomic and transcriptomic data of t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare. in the hexaploid t. aestivum,  <dig> putative full-length annexin genes were identified based on incomplete draft genome sequences, expressed sequence tags , and whole genome survey sequences   <cit> . an additional annexin-coding sequence, taann10-a , was assembled independently from hiseq <dig>  cdna sequences . putative open reading frames and protein sequences were deduced from the  <dig> annexin-coding sequences, searched against the pfam database  <cit> , and found to contain at least two annexin domains. finally, these  <dig> annexin genes were assigned to the a, b, and d subgenome. it was observed that there are  <dig> members of an annexin gene family in each haploid genome in wheat. eight annexin genes in t. urartu and elven in a. tauschii were identified from their complete genome sequences . all assembled coding sequences were verified as full-length by comparison to the wheat sequences. similarly, eleven full-length cdna sequences of annexin genes were identified in h. vulgare , of which two were obtained from genbank while the other eight tentatively predicted from the second generation barley genomic sequences.

at deduced amino acid level, the average size of encoded polypeptides of the identified annexin genes from wheat, t. urartu, a. tauschii and barely was approximately  <dig> kd, similar to that of annotated annexins in arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and brachypodium distachyon. their predicted pi points of the identified annexin proteins were very divergent, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> ,  <dig>  to  <dig> , and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in wheat, t. urartu, a. tauschii and barley, respectively. aliphatic index showed a range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the grand average of hydropathicity showed similar pattern, suggesting that above identified putative annexins are hydrophobic proteins . similar to other plant annexins  <cit> , the deduced amino acid sequences of wheat annexins contain several conserved residues/motifs in addition to the annexin repeat, such as endonexin fold, a cysteine-rich and a zinc finger type  domain signature sequence, the his <dig> residue for peroxidase activity, s <dig> cluster putatively involved in redox reactions, salt bridges involved in the channel function of animal annexins, and iri actin-binding motif .

structure and phylogeny of annexin gene family
the primary sequences of annexins in t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare fairly diverged from each other. in these four species, identities of the annexins were 19–83 %, 19–78 %, 17–78 % and 19–83 %, respectively. to facilitate comparison of the annexin families in different species, we analyzed conserved motifs of  <dig> annexins from t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii, h. vulgare and o. sativa. the results showed that these  <dig> annexins were classified into  <dig> groups . meanwhile, a total of  <dig> motifs containing  <dig> to  <dig> residues were identified and each of these motifs was annotated by interproscan and smart databases . the members of each group shared similar motif organizations. four motifs named  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were found to be associated with calcium-dependent phospholipid binding/calcium ion binding function. the diversity of motif patterns based on combinations of motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> was in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis , besides, these motif patterns were conserved and specific to each group .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis and predicted structure of annexin proteins in t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii, h. vulgare and o. sativa

to analyze the evolutionary relationship of annexins, an unrooted tree was constructed using  <dig> full-length annexin protein sequences from nine monocot species and seven eudicots. the tree showed that all annexin homologs were clustered into six groups  with high statistical support . in each clade, it can be separated into a monocots subgroup and a eudicots subgroup, except for osann10b   <cit> . as the annexin multigene family appeared to expand possibly by duplication events  <cit> , phylogenetic analyses suggest that the six groups have their own ancestors after their divergence from angiosperm flowering plants and then each subgroup have parallel evolution in similar way diverging into monocots and dicots. some annexins from the same species were clustered into one subgroup, such as most of grape vine annexins were present in group iii. we also observed the orthologous annexins of wheat in other monocots .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of annexin protein sequences from  <dig> plant species. unrooted phylogenetic tree using  <dig> full-length amino acid sequences from nine monocot species and seven dicots species. numbers on the tree represent bootstrap values. the roman letters represent the six groups. the different branch color represents monocots  and dicots , respectively. members of annexin proteins from wheat were denoted in red and barley in green



exon-intron organization structure analysis of annexin genes in wheat and barley revealed that the number of introns per gene varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  the intron positions of orthologous annexin genes  in wheat and barley and their phases with symmetric exons are well conserved indicating that all these annexin genes might have a common ancestor .fig.  <dig> gene structure of annexin genes in barley and wheat. a barley; b wheat. gene structures were generated from gsds . exons, utrs, introns and intron phases are shown



comparative analysis of annexins between monocots and eudicots
six distinct clusters of annexins were revealed by phylogenetic analysis of annexin proteins from three monocots  and two eudicots  . within in each subgroup, two distinct clusters corresponding to monocots and eudicots were formed except for osann10a. within every subgroup, monocots  showed less divergence as indicated by a shorter branch length, which marks sequence changes in species relative to its common ancestor, compared to the examined dicots  . regarding protein structure, we also found the four domains of annexins in monocots were relatively more conserved than that in eudicots by alignment analysis of amino acid sequence . interestingly, we observed that the iri motif for binding actin in the third domain was only conserved in the iv subfamily in monocots. in addition, several highly conserved charged residues were only found in annexin domains of monocots, such as domain- <dig>  . these data showed that the structure of annexin proteins in monocots was more stable than that in eudicots, suggesting that annexins probably played important roles in the evolution history of monocots.

although the sizes of predicted annexin proteins were highly similar in eudicots and monocots tested, comparison of the genomic sequences revealed a novel pattern of intron evolution. interestingly, the total sizes of exomes in eudicots and monocots were not much different, but large differences in intron sizes of some annexin genes were observed between eudicots  and monocots  . changes in the sizes of introns without significantly affecting the protein sequence or structure suggest that at least for annexin genes, the evolution of introns is different from that of extrons.

phylogenetic analysis of annexin genes in t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare
to further analyze the evolutionary relationships of annexin genes in t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare species, the genetic variation and selective pressure of each of ann1– <dig> genes among the four species were measured by the software of dnasp  <dig>  . the results showed that the nucleotide diversities  of most annexin genes among different species were very low, except for ann <dig> and ann <dig> genes with pi values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . to detect whether annexin genes have been under selective pressures among the four species, we first made the neutral model test for every annexin gene by tajima's d analysis. only ann <dig>  ann <dig>  ann <dig> genes exhibited significant departures from neutral expectations, suggesting that these genes have been under selective pressures in their evolutionary histories. the nonsyn/syn  ratios of ann <dig>  ann <dig> and ann <dig> genes were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that ann <dig> gene has been under positive selection, but ann <dig> and ann <dig> have been under purifying selection .table  <dig> the evolution analysis of ann1– <dig> genes among and within t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare species by dnasp  <dig>  software

by analyzing the genetic variations and selective pressures of ann1– <dig> genes within each of the four species , we found the nucleotide diversities of ann1– <dig> genes in t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare species were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , respectively, which were obviously higher than that of each ann gene among different species as shown in table  <dig>  these results indicated that the conservation level of each ann gene among different species was higher than that of ann1– <dig> genes in the same species. in addition, by the tajima's d analysis, we found ann1– <dig> genes in each species did not exhibit significant deviation from neutral expectations, indicating that no selective pressure was operated on annexin genes in the same species.

expression analysis of annexin genes in response to abiotic stresses
accumulating evidences from various plant species, including arabidopsis, tomato and rice, have shown the up- and down-regulation of annexin genes in response to abiotic stress and aba  <cit> . to examine the expression patterns of  <dig> wheat annexin genes  under various abiotic stress conditions, we took advantage of the available data on transcriptional profiling . the analysis of microarray data indicated that some of the annexin genes were regulated by various abiotic stress conditions . the expression of taann12-a and taann12-d were induced, reversely, taann5-b and taann7-d were down-regulated by drought both in the drought tolerant 'luohan no.2'  and drought susceptible 'chinese spring' . meanwhile, taann1-a/d and taann6-a/b were down-regulated in 'luohan no.2'  but up-regulated in 'chinese spring'  under peg treatment . taann4-a/d and taann12-a were reduced by salt in the root and shoot samples of salt tolerant wheat germplasm lines w <dig> and salt susceptible 'chinese spring'  . taann12-a and taann12-d were strongly induced, reversely, taann1-a/d and taann2-b were down-regulated by cold stress in winter manitou , spring northstar , spring manitou , and winter northstar  . these microarray data indicate that taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> probably play important roles in abiotic stress response.fig.  <dig> expression patterns of  <dig> taann genes under drought, salt and cold conditions. heat maps were made based on the published microarray data to represent expression patterns. a the heat map for expression patterns under drought condition. expression data were obtained from ta <dig>  experiment. the plant materials used are roots of luohan  and chinese spring  seedlings. b the heat map for expression patterns under salt condition. expression data were obtained from e-mexp- <dig> experiment. roots and shoots of a highly salt-tolerant wheat line  <dig> and a salt-sensitive line cs were used. c the heat map for expression patterns under cold treatment. expression data were got from ta <dig>  experiment



to confirm the results of microarray data, and identify the wheat annexin genes that respond to abiotic stresses and aba, we checked the transcription levels of taann1– <dig> genes  in seedling shoots challenged with salt, drought, cold and aba. some wheat annexin genes such as taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were consistent with the gene chip data, . most wheat annexin genes were induced by single or several stresses,but the expression levels of taann <dig> and taann <dig> were not obviously changed under different stress conditions. all wheat annexin genes, except for taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig>  were induced by aba . interestingly, taann <dig>  which showed no obvious change under salt, drought and cold, was induced by aba, implying its important role in aba response . taann <dig> was down-regulated to the control level after the drought treatment for 5 h, but was obviously up-regulated under salt and aba, which is consist with the microarray data in fig.  <dig> . the expression level of taann <dig> was nearly unchanged under cold, but was increased under drought, salt and aba conditions. taann <dig> and taann <dig> were significantly induced by salt, drought, cold and aba, indicating that the two genes play key roles in responses to abiotic stresses. interestingly, taann <dig>  which is an exciting candidate drought, cold, salt tolerance gene in crop breeding, has no orthologs in a. thaliana.fig.  <dig> expression of wheat annexin genes in response to abiotic stress and aba by real-time pcr. wheat jinghua  <dig> seedlings grown for 14 days on ms medium were treated with peg- <dig>    <dig> ummol · l− <dig> aba  4 °c  and 250 mm nacl  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 h, respectively. total rna was extracted from jinghua  <dig> seedlings and used for real-time pcr. the expression level of wheat actin was used as the internal control to standardize the rna samples for each reaction, and the expression in the treated 0 h samples was set as  <dig>  each data point is the average of three biological repeats, and error bars represent the standard error



we also analyzed the putative cis-elements within the  <dig> kb region of genomic sequences upstream of the 5′-utr of wheat annexin genes except for taann1-d  and taann6-b  to search for stress-response related cis-elements in place database . the results showed that  <dig> annexin genes contain the abre , dre/crt  and ltre  putative cis-elements motifs . in addition,the promoters of  <dig> annexin genes,  <dig> annexin and  <dig> annexin genes only contain abre, dre/crt or ltre elements, respectively. abre and dre/crt motifs are responsible for salinity, dehydration, heat and cold stresses, and ltre motif is responsible for cold stress  <cit> .

tissue-specific and developmental expression of wheat annexin genes
to profile the developmental expression pattern of annexin genes in wheat, we analyzed the expression levels of ten taann genes in six organs by real-time pcr . taann <dig> and taann <dig> were mainly expressed in root, but taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were mainly expressed in leaf. the expression levels of taann <dig> and taann <dig> were highest in stem followed by root, and were very low in glume, stamen and seed tissues. the expression levels of taann <dig> in root, stem and stamen were similar, and significantly higher than that in leaf, glume and seed. the higher expression of taann <dig> was observed in root and leaf. to complement the real-time pcr results, we analyzed the microarray data covering genome-wide gene expression of wheat development  <cit> . the result was an expression atlas of  <dig> wheat annexin genes  covering major developmental stages  during the life cycle of wheat . the results also showed that taann <dig> and taann <dig> were mainly expressed in germinating embryo and seedling crown. the highest expression levels of taann <dig> and taann <dig> were observed in floral bracts before anthesis. for taann <dig> and taann <dig>  expression levels were higher in the root of germinating seed and the root as well as the leaf of seedling. the highest expression level of taann <dig> was detected in immature inflorescence, by contrast, that of taann <dig> was observed in the immature embryo. taann <dig> was mainly expressed in the coleoptile of germinating seed and the immature caryopsis, however, the highest expression levels of taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were detected in anthers before anthesis. taann <dig> was highly expressed in floral bracts, pistil, anthers and immature endosperm which were consistent with the gene chip data . to confirm the results of microarray data, we checked the transcription levels of taann <dig>  taann <dig>  and taann <dig> in 7-day-old root, 7-day-old stem, 7-day-old leaf, 14-day-old root, 14-day-old stem, 14-day-old leaf, stamen before flowering and  <dig> dap seed by real-time pcr. we found the highest expression levels of taann <dig> and taann <dig> in 7-day-old young leaf followed by 14-day-old leaf and14-day-old stem, and the expression level of taann <dig> was highest in anther followed by 7-day-old young leaf . these results were in accordance with the microarray data . to further confirm taann <dig> expression pattern in flower phase, we also analyzed the expression level of taann <dig> in the spike at stamen and pistil initiation stage, anther at anther separation stage, anther at meiosis stage, and spike not including anther at meiosis stage. the results showed taann <dig> was highly expressed in anther, and its expression levels in the pistil and floral bracts were relatively low . also the highest expression level of taann <dig> in anther at meiosis stage was 12-fold and 5-fold higher than that in spike not including anther at meiosis stage and spike at stamen and pistil initiation stage, respectively . these results suggested that taann <dig> was possible to be related to plant anther development.fig.  <dig> real-time pcr analysis of wheat annexin genes in pivotal organs. the expression level of wheat actin was used as the internal control to standardize the rna samples for each reaction, and the expression in the root was set as  <dig>  the data are from three biological replicates, and error bars represent the standard error

taann <dig> is involved in cold induced male sterility
development-dependent and temperature sensitive expression patterns of taann <dig> in the anther prompted us to investigate whether it is involved in male reproductive development. to this end, we employed the two-line hybrid wheat system, examined pollen vitality and profiled expression pattern of taann <dig> in six wheat lines. bs <dig> and bs <dig> are two thermosensitive genic male sterile lines extensively used for the production of two-line hybrid wheat  <cit> . pollens from both lines displayed vastly reduced vitality when the plants were grown under non-permissive temperature  . glds and taiyuan <dig> are two independent recovery lines that have the ability to generate fully fertile f <dig> hybrid lines when crossed with the sterile lines as the pollen donor. indeed, pollens from glsd and taiyuan <dig> exhibited superior vitality . in bs366 × glds and bs366 × taiyuan <dig> hybrid lines, pollen vitality appeared comparable to that of the recovery lines. consistent with pollen vitality, the two sterile lines have vastly reduced rate of seed setting, in contrast to the other four lines .fig.  <dig> down-regulation of taann <dig> is associated with the cold-induced male fertility. a under cold stress , pollen grains from two male sterile lines bs <dig> and bs <dig>  two recovery lines glds and taiyuan <dig>  and bs366 × glds and bs366 × taiyuan <dig> hybrids lines anthers were devoid of starch . b rate of seed setting from two male sterile lines bs <dig> and bs <dig>  two recovery lines glds and taiyuan <dig>  and bs366 × glds and bs366 × taiyuan <dig> hybrids lines. data presented as means ± sd from three independent experiments, each with fifty plants per line per experiment. c the expression level of taann <dig> gene in leaf  and anther  at meiosis stage under cold treatment , in two male sterile lines bs <dig> and bs <dig>  two recovery lines glds and taiyuan <dig>  and two hybrid lines bs366 × glds and bs366 × taiyuan <dig>  the expression level of wheat actin was used as the internal control to standardize the rna samples for each reaction. the real-time pcr data are from three biological replicates, and error bars represent the standard error



by real-time pcr, we profiled the expression of taann <dig> in the leaf and stamen of the six wheat lines . the expression of taann <dig> in the leaf across the six lines remained constant. consistent with tissue specificity reported in fig. 7b, in the two recovery lines, the expression level of taann <dig> in the stamen greatly exceeded that in the leaf. by contrast, in the two conditional sterile lines bs <dig> and bs <dig>  taann <dig> levels in the stamen were markedly lower than that in the leaf. importantly, the expression level of taann <dig> in the stamen was partially restored in the two f <dig> hybrids. therefore, the relative expression levels of taann <dig> in the stamen strongly correlate with male fertility in the six examined lines, suggesting that specific down-regulation of taann <dig> is associated with conditional male sterility in wheat.

discussion
the annexin family genes and their structures
only two monocot plant annexins families, rice and maize, have been characterized based on the genome sequence data  <cit> . now, only three annexin genes in wheat  have been characterized  <cit> . in this study, six of the  <dig> wheat annexin genes identified in the est databases at genbank were also identified in the wss. taann1-d, taann2-b, taann3-b, taann4-a, taann4-d, taann5-b, taann6-b, taann7-b, taann7-d, taann9-b, taann10-b, taann11-a, taann11-d and taann12-d which were not represented in t. aestivum est database at genbank were identified in the wss. brachypodium distachyon, the most closely wheat related monocot species with an available completed and annotated genome sequence, has  <dig> annexin genes. rice  has  <dig> annexin genes. nearly all annexin genes in o. sativa and b. distachyon except for osann <dig> and bdann <dig> have orthologs in t. aestivuma, h. vulgare, t. urartu and a. tauschii, as judged by orthomcl  software .

his residue was thought to be essential for peroxidase activity  <cit> , and we found  <dig> wheat annexins contain conserved his residue at the n-terminal region . certain wheat annexins also contain the predicted iri motif involved in f-actin and gtp-binding regions  for phosphodiesterase activity  <cit> . the deduced proteins also contain residues for the formation of salt bridges that are hypothesized to be involved in the formation of ion channel activity  <cit>  . wheat annexins also contain conserved residues that are involved in the potential formation of an unusual sulfur cluster  functioning in oxidative stress response  <cit> . in addition, the n-terminal regions of taann2-a and taann2-b both contain a cysteine-rich and a zinc finger type  domain signature sequence. the c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins are involved in transcriptional regulation by binding dna or rna  <cit> . these results suggest that the wheat annexin gene family probably participate in many different biological processes.

all annexins are speculated to have evolved from a common ancestor, and increased gene number may have resulted from gene duplication events, which can be seen from amino acid sequence similarities and their genome locations  <cit> . since these distantly related species have gene family members which share branches with sequences, from wheat throughout the tree, it seems that the representation of annexin from wheat is likely complete . the larger number of annexin genes in triticeae, supported by identified sequences from wheat, t. urartu, a. tauschii and barley, and the representation of genes from o. sativa on the major sub-branches in the phylogram indicate that the triticeae had two gene duplications after the evolutionary separation from rice, and before the separation of the three wheat progenitor species from each other. these duplications in the triticeae lineage after the separation from rice are the taann <dig> and taann <dig> duplication, and subsequently the taann <dig> and taann <dig> duplication . the localization of these putative gene duplications on the same chromosomes supports this notion, since gene duplications often occur as tandem duplications  <cit> , though further investigation would be required to demonstrate that the duplications were in tandem. tuann <dig> and aeann <dig> were not identified in t. urartu and a. tauschii data sets in genbank or wss. this may represent gene loss, loss of gene expression or may be due to incomplete transcriptome or genome sequence from these species in the current databases. the lengths of branches were scaled according to amino acid differences between sequences, thus providing an estimate of evolutionary distance. grape annexin genes were largely clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that gene duplication events occurred independently in the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous branches of the tree . the structural and phylogenetic analyses indicate that orthologous annexin genes within a group might have functional redundancy . however, the gene expression study with respect to different tissues, developmental stages and abiotic stressors suggests that many members of the wheat annexins gene family have non-overlapping functions .

implication of cis-elements in annexin gene expression
cis-elements are important molecular switches involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes during abiotic stress responses and may be induced through aba-dependent and aba-independent signal transduction pathways  <cit> . for aba responsiveness, all annexin genes contain abre-motif elements within their promoter sequences, with the exception of taann6-b . however, taann <dig> gene was up-regulated under aba treatment, while the expression levels of taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were not significantly changed . the promoters of seven annexin genes  contain dre/crt motif responsible for activation during salinity, dehydration, heat and cold stress following aba-independent signal transduction pathways . only taann <dig> and taann <dig> genes were significantly induced by drought and salinity stresses . taann <dig> was probably induced through aba-independent signal pathway, as its promoter does not contain dre/crt cis-element. the induction of taann <dig> could be due to the presence of abre and dre/crt motifs and the cross-talk between aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways.

as ltre motifs containing genes, taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were up-regulated but taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> expressions were nearly not affected by cold stress , indicating that the gene expression level under cold condition was not only dependent on the existence of ltre element.

tissue-preferential expression of annexin genes
previous studies have demonstrated that annexin genes are expressed in various plant tissues  <cit> . comprehensive expression profiles of the annexin gene family throughout the body and lifespan of wheat have not been previously reported. in this study, the expression profiles of ten taann genes in different wheat tissues were investigated using real-time pcr . the results provided valuable information for elucidating the functions of the annexin gene family in wheat. different annexin genes exhibited diverse expression patterns in wheat. several annexin genes showed organ-preferential expression patterns, suggesting specific or significant roles in vivo. annexins may play important roles in roots. transcripts of medicago truncatula and maize annexins have been detected in the root elongation zone  <cit> . in this study, taann <dig> and taann <dig> were preferentially expressed in root. the expression pattern of taann <dig> in root, stem and leaves was in general agreement with the expression data of annat <dig>  <cit> . the functions of annexins in mature stem, root and flag leaf, which are organs involved in water and nutrient conductance and grain filling, remain unclear. however, annexins in phloem sap were proposed to be involved in the long-distance signal transduction via sensing ca2+  <cit> . taann <dig>  taann <dig>  taann <dig> and taann <dig> were mainly expressed in the flag leaf . the flag leaf is the major organ for transitory starch metabolism in this species and its assimilates are the most important contributor to dry weight accumulation in the grains  <cit> . the function of annexins expressed in the flag leaf is not yet clear. atann <dig> related to pollen grains development was specifically expressed in anther  <cit> . in this study, taann <dig> was preferentially expressed in stamen after anthesis and displayed a low level in the spike not including anther, suggesting it may be involved in the process of stamen development or maturation .

annexin genes expression regulation by abiotic stress and aba
accumulating evidences from various plant species including arabidopsis, rice and tomato have shown the up-regulation of annexin genes in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . however, no such information about wheat annexin genes is available. in this research, most of wheat annexin genes showed the induced expression pattern under stress treatments , which was similar to other plant annexin genes reported. aba is a phytohormone critical for plant growth and stress response. it plays important roles in integrating various stress signals and controlling downstream stress responses. the mechanisms by which plants respond to stresses include aba-dependent and aba-independent processes  <cit> . in this study, many annexin genes were induced both by aba and some aboitic stresses, suggesting these genes probably function in stress responses through aba-dependent pathway .

taann <dig>  calcium signaling, and cold-induced male sterility in wheat
tgms breeding lines of wheat are hypersensitive to low temperature during the meiosis stage  <cit>  . upon stressed by cold, separation of dyads was abnormally, the phragmoplast defectively formed, and the cell plate irregularly assembled during male meiosis i in these lines. transcriptome profiling revealed that genes playing key roles in the dynamic organization of cytoskeletons were dramatically repressed in cold stressed anther of the tgms lines  <cit> . for example, genes encoding profilin and adf , which act synergistically to regulate actin dynamics  <cit> , were drastically repressed in cold stressed anthers  <cit> . adf activity can be regulated by phosphorylation, and a calmodulin-like domain protein kinase  was known to phosphorylate adf in plants  <cit> . thus, we speculate that calcium signaling is probably involved in cold induced male sterility of tgms lines.

ca2+ is a secondary messenger in signaling pathways for a diverse array of stimuli in plants  <cit> . when exposed to low temperature, plants increase their cytosolic calcium levels, which are mainly mediated by ca2+ influx from the intercellular space . the calcium signals are sensed by calcium sensors such as cams/cmls, cdpks/ccamks and cbls  <cit> . annexins act primarily as a putative “linker” between calcium signaling, the actin cytoskeleton, and the membrane. it is intriguing to note in this regard that the expression of taann <dig> was preferentially in the stamen and strongly induced by cold treatment in the recovery lines and the f <dig> hybrids but not the tgms lines . further, the transcript level of a specific cdpk of wheat, tacdpk <dig> , showed no obvious change under salinity, drought and aba treatments, but was strongly induced by cold stress, which was in consistent with that of taann <dig>  we found a burst of tacdpk <dig> transcript abundance prior to that of taann <dig> under normal condition in bs <dig> . this pattern was enhanced upon cold stress for tacdpk <dig> while taann <dig> expression level remained flat. genetic studies in arabidopsis has revealed that atann <dig> is involved in pollen development, germination and pollen tube growth through the promotion of endomembrane trafficking modulated by calcium  <cit> . it is possible that taann <dig>  which is not orthologous to atann <dig> based on sequence similarity , also participates in relaying cold-induced calcium signals to modulating cytoskeleton dynamics. together, these results indicate that the strengthened calcium signaling upon cold stress due to failed taann <dig> induction could be one of mechanisms underlying temperature sensitive male sterility of tgms lines. in summary, the current work has opened a new avenue for functional studies of calcium dependent annexin genes in male reproductive development of wheat.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> and  <dig> putative annexin genes were identified in wheat and barley, respectively.  <dig> and  <dig> annexin genes were identified in t. urartu and a. tauschii, respectively. annexins from these four species and some other monocots and eudicots were classified into six different orthologous groups that share similar motif organizations. the nucleotide diversity of each of ann1– <dig> genes among t. aestivum, t. urartu, a. tauschii and h. vulgare species was very low. ann <dig> gene has been under positive selection, but ann <dig> and ann <dig> have been under purifying selection among the four species in their evolutionary histories.

we found that wheat annexin genes showed differential tissue-specific and abiotic stresses responsive expression patterns. importantly, taann <dig> is preferentially expressed in the anther but fails to be induced by low temperature in thermosensitive genic male sterile lines, suggesting that the specific down-regulation of taann <dig> is associated with the conditional male sterility in wheat. in a word, these results provided significant information for understanding the diverse roles of plant annexins and opened a new avenue for functional studies of cold induced male sterility in wheat.
