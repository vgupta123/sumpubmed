BACKGROUND
the precise establishment and release of sister chromatid cohesion are vital for cell division during mitosis and meiosis  <cit> . the cohesin complex, which forms a ring to entrap sister chromatids, is composed of four subunits: a heterodimer of structural maintenance of chromosome  proteins, smc <dig> and smc <dig>  an α-kleisin, sister chromatid cohesion <dig>  in somatic cells or rec <dig> in meiotic cells and scc <dig>  <cit> . the core cohesin complex associates with a number of factors during the cohesion cycle  <cit>  and its association with the chromosomes is controlled by modifications, such as acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation and proteolysis  <cit> .

sister chromatid cohesion is established during s phase by the establishment of cohesion protein, eco1/ctf <dig>  <cit> . in budding yeast, eco1/ctf <dig> acetylates lysine residues k <dig>  k <dig> of smc <dig> and k <dig>  k <dig> of scc <dig> to stabilize the ring and keep it closed  <cit> . eco1/ctf <dig> is an essential gene in many organisms with the complete inactivation of ctf <dig> resulting in lethality  <cit> . inactivation or mutations in eco1/ctf <dig> leads to a broad range of defects, including chromosome mis-segregation, defects in dna double strand break repair, defects in homologous recombination and transcriptional alterations  <cit> . humans contain two eco1/ctf <dig> orthologs, esco <dig> and esco <dig>  <cit> . mutations in esco <dig> lead to roberts syndrome , which is associated with a variety of defects including growth retardation, limb reduction/asymmetric limb growth, cleft lip/palate and missing fingers/toes  <cit> .

arabidopsis contains a single ctf <dig> ortholog , which can complement the temperature-sensitive yeast ctf7- <dig> mutant  <cit> . atctf <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein, containing a pip box at residues  <dig> to  <dig>  a c2h <dig> zinc finger motif at residues 92– <dig> and an acetyltransferase domain from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  the acetyltransferase domain can be further separated into three motifs: d , a  and b . motif d provides the framework of the acetyltransferase domain. motif a participates in acetyl-coa binding and is critical for catalytic activity, while motif b is the most c-terminal region and participates in substrate recognition and catalytic activity regulation  <cit> . variations in atctf <dig> expression have been shown to result in a wide range of defects. plants heterozygous for a t-dna insertion in atctf <dig> grow normally but their siliques contain approximately 25% arrested seeds, consistent with the belief that ctf <dig> is an essential protein  <cit> . however, atctf <dig> homozygous plants can be detected at very low frequencies  <cit> . atctf <dig> plants exhibit a wide range of developmental defects, including extreme dwarfism and sterility with atctf <dig> meiocytes exhibiting abnormal chromosome segregation and defective sister chromatid cohesion. knockdown of atctf <dig> mrna levels using rnai leads to growth retardation and defective sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . finally, overexpression of full length atctf <dig> with the camv 35s promoter leads to ovule abortion, but plant growth is not affected  <cit> .

to further investigate the roles of ctf <dig> in arabidopsis and to identify atctf <dig> interacting proteins, transgenic plants expressing atctf <dig> constructs that encode either tap-tagged  <cit>  or non-tagged versions of full length or truncated atctf <dig> were generated and analyzed. transgenic plants that express a truncated version of atctf <dig>  missing motif b, from the 35s promoter exhibited impaired reproduction and vegetative growth. ovules in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants displayed alterations in cell identity and the timing of megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis, while male meiocytes exhibited alterations during meiosis ii. the transgenic plants also displayed alterations in vegetative growth that were not inherited in a mendelian fashion.

RESULTS
arabidopsis plants expressing high levels of ntap:atctf7∆b display reduced fertility
an atctf <dig> construct missing the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  was generated, fused with ntap  <cit>  and expressed from the camv 35s promoter in wild-type columbia plants . twenty out of the  <dig> independent lines examined exhibited reduced fertility, with fertility levels varying significantly between the lines. plants exhibiting a weak phenotype, which accounted for two of the  <dig> reduced fertility lines, produced shorter siliques with reduced numbers of seeds, but the seeds appeared normal . for example line  <dig> produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  seeds per silique  compared to wild type plants that produce  <dig>  ±  <dig>  seeds per silique . anthers from line  <dig> plants were smaller and contained reduced numbers of pollen , but the pollen appeared viable . the other  <dig> reduced fertility lines exhibited more severe defects. these plants produced siliques containing large numbers of unfertilized ovules and aborted seeds . unfertilized ovules appeared as white dots, resembling the situation in atctf7- <dig> plants  <cit> . aborted seeds appeared white and plump, similar to seeds containing arrested embryos in atctf7-1+/− plants  <cit> . seed set varied considerably between the lines, ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  seeds per silique to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  seeds per silique. anthers from these plants typically contained reduced numbers of pollen, much of which was not viable. for example, anthers from line  <dig> produced on average approximately  <dig> pollen, of which only 20% was viable . given that most lines exhibited severe fertility defects, one representative line  was chosen and characterized in detail.figure  <dig>

the reduced fertility phenotype of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants suggested that co-suppression may be lowering atctf <dig> transcript levels in the lines. therefore, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  was conducted to examine transcript levels of native atctf <dig> as well as the ctf <dig> transgene. surprisingly, total atctf <dig>  transcript levels were approximately seven-fold higher in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants than ctf <dig> transcript levels in wild type plants, while native atctf <dig> transcript levels were almost three-fold higher in the transgenic plants . therefore, the transgenic lines contained high levels of atctf7∆b transcripts along with elevated levels of native atctf <dig> mrna, indicating that the observed phenotypes are not the result of reduced atctf <dig> expression. instead these results suggest that the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct may be exerting a dominant negative effect.

reciprocal crossing experiments were carried out to determine the effect of the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct on male and female gametes. the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct was transmitted at reduced levels through both male and female gametes , consistent with our preliminary results that both male and female fertility were affected in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants. nonviable seeds were obtained when 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants were used as either the male or female parent; however the relative proportion of nonviable seed was three times greater  when 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants served as the female. the number of nonviable seeds was greatest  in self-pollenated plants. therefore, while both male and female gametes are affected, the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct has a greater effect on female reproduction. inheritance of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b-associated defects from both parents has a compounding effect on seed production.

male meiotic chromosome segregation is altered in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants
previous studies showed that inactivation of atctf <dig> via t-dna insertion or reduction in atctf <dig> mrna levels via rnai disrupts sister chromatid cohesion, resulting in uneven chromosome segregation during meiosis and ultimately reduced pollen viability  <cit> . the reduced fertility observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants suggested that meiosis might also be affected in these lines. therefore, chromosome spreading experiments were carried out to examine the effect of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b expression on male meiosis.

male meiocytes in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants resembled wild type during early stages of meiosis, with normal chromosome morphology during pachytene , diakinesis  and metaphase i . the first noticeable defect was observed at telophase i when lagging chromosomes were observed , followed by mis-segregated chromosomes at prophase ii . more than twenty individual chromosomes were typically observed in meiocytes beginning at metaphase ii , indicating that sister chromatid cohesion was prematurely lost. chromosomes did not segregate evenly at anaphase ii  resulting in the production of polyads with varying dna contents at tetrad stage . similar to atctf <dig> plants, a small number of relatively normal meiocytes were also observed throughout meiosis with fewer normal-appearing meiocytes in later stages of meiosis. for example, the percentages of defective meiocytes observed at various stages of meiosis in line  <dig> were: metaphase i: 0% , telophase i:  <dig> % , prophase ii:  <dig> % , metaphase ii:  <dig> % , anaphase ii:  <dig> %  and telophase ii:  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

immunolocalization experiments were then carried out to examine the distribution of the meiotic cohesin protein syn <dig>  <cit>  in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b male meiocytes. consistent with meiotic chromosome spreading experiments the overall distribution of syn <dig> was not dramatically affected in meiocytes of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . syn <dig> exhibited diffuse nuclear labeling during interphase with strong signal observed on the developing chromosomal axes from early leptotene into zygotene . during late zygotene and pachytene the protein lined the chromosomes . syn <dig> was released normally from the condensing chromosomes during diplotene and diakinesis and similar to the situation in wild type, syn <dig> was barely detectable on chromosomes by prometaphase i. therefore, cohesin appears to load and be removed normally from meiotic chromosomes in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants.

female gametophyte development is altered in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants
previous studies showed that ovule development is very sensitive to atctf <dig> levels  <cit> . approximately 50% of the ovules from atctf7-1+/–plants contain non-degenerated antipodal nuclei  <cit> , while ovules from atctf <dig> plants degenerate early  <cit> . rnai directed reduction of atctf <dig> mrna levels, as well as 35s-mediated increases in atctf <dig> transcript levels result in ovule arrest at female gametophyte   <dig> stage  <cit> .

to elucidate the function of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b in ovule development, ovules from wild type and line  <dig> plants were analyzed by differential interference contrast  microscopy. in wild type siliques, archesporial cells are specified from the subepidermal cell layers and differentiate into megaspore mother cells, which are initially unpolarized and become polarized prior to the start of meiosis . two rounds of meiosis produce a tetrad of four haploid megaspores   <cit> . prior to fg <dig>  the megaspore mother cell, dyad and tetrad are all adjacent to l <dig> cells   <cit> . when the ovule reaches fg <dig>  the megaspore at the chalazal-end differentiates into the functional megaspore while the other three megaspores undergo programmed cell death   <cit> . in wild type siliques, adjacent ovules are similar in size and point in opposite directions .figure  <dig>

in mutant plants, defects were observed in ovules very early in development. approximately  <dig> %  of the ovules observed were defective at the premeiosis stage. abnormally enlarged sub-epidermal cells were observed adjacent to normal looking megaspore mother cells in some pre-meiotic ovules . adjacent ovules were often different in size and sometimes pointed in the same direction . a functional megaspore was not identified in some ovules even though their shape and size was beyond fg <dig>  instead, large cells with prominent nuclei and megaspore-like characteristics  <cit>  were found in the position of a normal embryo sac . ovules containing either one megaspore-like cell  or two megaspore-like cells with dyad characteristics  were also observed. this suggested that meiosis is delayed, altered and arrested in most megaspores. extra cells were also observed between the megaspores and the l <dig> layer of cells . in wt plants, a small number  of ovules were found to contain twin megaspore mother cells; however no defects were observed during or after meiosis. in line  <dig> plants,  <dig> %  of the ovules contained multiple megaspore mother-like cells at pre-meiosis. furthermore,  <dig> %  of ovules with dyads contained extra cells between the dyad and l <dig> layer, and  <dig> %  the dyads were in elongated shape. ultimately  <dig> %  of the ovules observed were defective at fg <dig> stage. therefore, alterations in archesporial cell differentiation, the onset and progression of meiosis and possibly somatic cell identity are observed in ovules of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants.

the effects of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b on megagametogenesis were investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy  and dic microscopy. during wild type megagametogenesis, the functional megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitosis accompanied by nuclear migration, fusion, degeneration and cellularization to form the final embryo sac . at fg <dig>  the functional megaspore undergoes mitosis to produce a two-nucleate embryo sac . formation of a vacuole between the two nuclei marks stage fg <dig> . during fg <dig> the ovule becomes curved and the inner integument embraces the nucellus. a second round of mitosis produces a four-nucleate embryo sac . this is followed by migration of the two chalazal nuclei from an orthogonal orientation to a chalazal-micropylar orientation. after nuclear migration, a third round of mitosis gives rise to eight nuclei in a 4n + 4n configuration . the two polar nuclei, one from each side, meet at the embryo sac’s micropylar half and fuse to form the central cell, while the antipodal nuclei start to degenerate . the central cell has formed and the antipodal nuclei are completed degenerated by fg <dig> . prior to fertilization, one synergid nucleus degenerates, such that the embryo sac consists of one egg cell, one central cell and one synergid nucleus .figure  <dig>

ovule development is typically synchronous in wild type sliques with predominately one or two developmental stages present in a given pistil . in contrast, 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b ovule development appeared slowed and asynchronous . female gametophytes in the same pistil were often at several different stages, indicating that the synchrony of gametophyte development was disturbed and embryo sac maturation was delayed. ovules containing a megaspore , fg <dig> embryo sacs with a functional megaspore-like cell  <cit>  and degrading megaspores , and abnormal fg <dig> and fg <dig> embryo sacs were commonly observed in the same slique . ovules containing degraded/degrading megasporocytes, and degrading fg <dig> embryo sacs were also observed . alterations in nuclear division appeared to precede arrest in some megaspores . most embryo sacs arrest at fg2/fg3; although some terminal ovules appeared to progress beyond fg <dig> . common phenotypes included degraded/degrading nuclei , degenerated embryo sacs , polar nuclei fusion defects  and vacuole development defects .

to determine if the alterations observed in line  <dig> are representative of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants in general, ovules from other lines exhibiting severely reduced fertility  were examined. similar to the situation in line <dig>  pre-meiotic ovules from line <dig> contained abnormally enlarged sub-epidermal cells adjacent to megaspore mother-like cells . during meiosis, ovules contained abnormal cells adjacent to degenerated megaspores . some ovules contained functional megaspore-like cells . mature ovules contained differentiated functional megaspore-like cells  and female gametophytes with various defects . similar to line  <dig>  female gametophytes from lines  <dig> and  <dig> developed slowly and asynchronously; embryo sacs arrested at fg <dig> and fg <dig> . additional alterations not observed in line  <dig> were also identified, including some ovules that appeared to contain two functional megaspore-like cells . in some ovules the middle megaspores appeared to differentiate into functional megaspore-like cells while the megaspores at the chalazal-end degenerated , suggesting that ovule polarity was disrupted. all together,  <dig> %  ovules examined in line  <dig> plants displayed alterations at pre-meiosis;  <dig> %  of the ovules were defective at meiosis and  <dig> %  of the ovules were defective at fg <dig>  therefore, common defects associated with ntap:atctf7∆b include a delay and alterations in both megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis with embryo sacs arresting at various stages of development.figure  <dig>

because the ovules of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants appeared to exhibit a delay in the onset of meiosis, qrt-pcr was carried out to examine transcript levels for several genes important for meiosis and ovule development . transcripts for wus <dig>  <cit> , mmd <dig>  <cit> , spo11- <dig>  <cit>  and zyp1a  <cit>  were elevated between two and three fold in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants relative to wild type. transcript levels of dmc <dig>  <cit> , syn <dig>  <cit>  and osd <dig>  <cit>  showed modest increases, while the transcript levels of other genes were unchanged .

expression of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b causes pleiotropic growth defects
during the analysis of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b reduced fertility lines, plants displaying vegetative defects began to appear in the t <dig> or t <dig> generations. specifically, later generations grew progressively worse in  <dig> of the  <dig> independent severely reduced fertility lines examined. the remaining six lines continued to display reduced fertility, but did not exhibit vegetative defects through the seventh generation. a wide range of morphological defects was observed in the  <dig> lines . the defects varied between lines and between progeny of the same line. the observed vegetative abnormalities included dwarf plants, fused stems and disruption of phyllotaxis .figure  <dig>

the proportion of plants exhibiting vegetative alterations increased in successive generations. likewise, the severity of the vegetative alterations also became successively worse in subsequent generations. for example, the frequency of dwarf plants increased from approximately 18% in the third generation to 82% by generation six . the dwarf phenotype also became more severe with later generations containing smaller, more defective plants. dwarf plants varied in morphology and exhibited a range of alterations, including acaulescent plants, floral abnormalities, homeotic changes and irregular leaves . while some of the most severe 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b dwarf plants resembled atctf7- <dig> plants , in general the phenotype was less severe than atctf7- <dig> plants. furthermore, while most atctf7- <dig> plants exhibit early senescence, 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants typically did not. in order to determine if the phenotypic alterations were due to increased 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b expression, native ctf <dig> and total ctf <dig> levels were measured in both dwarf and non-dwarf plants of three different generations of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants, which showed progressively more severe phenotypes. native ctf <dig> levels ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  fold above wild type in the different plants, while total ctf <dig> transcript levels were elevated  <dig> - <dig>  fold relative to wild type. however, no consistent difference was observed between dwarf and non-dwarf plants or between one generation and the other. therefore, the phenotypic differences observed are not due to dramatic changes in atctf7∆b transcript levels.table  <dig>

plants were from line  <dig>  seeds from reduced fertile, non-dwarf plants and from dwarf plants were collected and sown separately.



rather, and most surprisingly, the dwarf phenotype was not inherited in a mendelian fashion . when dwarf plants were selfed they produced a mixture of dwarf and non-dwarf, reduced fertile plants. the frequency of dwarf plants produced from selfed dwarf plants was similar to the frequency of dwarf plants resulting from selfing a non-dwarf plant. the stochastic appearance of the dwarf phenotype and variation in phenotypes suggested that the alterations could be the result of epigenetic changes. in order to investigate this possibility, qrt-pcr was carried out to measure the expression levels of several epigenetically regulated transposable elements , including mu <dig>  copia  <dig> and solo ltr  <cit> , as well as several genes associated with epigenetic events  <cit> . expression levels of mu <dig>  copia  <dig> and solo ltr were increased between five  and  <dig> fold  in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . subtle changes were also observed in the transcript levels of several sirna associated genes . argonaute <dig> , rdr <dig> and mir <dig> transcript levels were reduced approximately 40-60% while ago <dig> transcripts were elevated slightly. transcript levels of hda <dig> and rdm <dig> were also decreased approximately 50% , while transcript levels of the canonical dna methylation genes, met <dig> and dmt <dig>  did not vary significantly .figure  <dig>

transcript levels of several cell cycle  and dna repair  genes have previously been shown to be elevated in atctf <dig> plants  <cit> . these genes were tested and found to also be elevated in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . the similarities in morphological defects and expression patterns observed between 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b and atctf7- <dig> plants  <cit>  are consistent with the hypothesis that the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct is exerting a dominant negative effect.

finally, experiments were carried out to determine if the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b-associated defects are due to the presence of the n-terminal tag or the absence of the acetyltransferase b motif. a 35s:atctf7∆b construct was generated and transformed into wild type columbia plants . eight out of the  <dig> 35s:atctf7∆b transgenic lines examined exhibited reduced fertility, with the 35s:atctf7∆b defects typically appearing more severe than those in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . like 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants, dwarf plants were not observed until the third generation in 35s: atctf7∆b plants. however, dwarf plants appeared at higher frequencies and their phenotypes were more varied than 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . for example, the viability of line  <dig> decreased with successive generations, such that seeds from this line were not viable by the 4th generation. likewise, while abnormalities associated with 35s:atctf7∆b plants were similar to those observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants, additional alterations were also present. for example, 35s:atctf7∆b line  <dig> segregated for two types of plants, those without an inflorescence and “normal” reduced fertility plants . 35s:atctf7∆b line  <dig> plants produced siliques that pointed downward and contained fewer seeds  . this phenotype is similar to bp/knat <dig> mutations  <cit> .

finally, in order to investigate which aspect of the 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b construct was causing the fertility and growth defects, several additional constructs were generated and introduced into wild type or atctf7-1+/− plants. wild type plants transformed with a 35s:ntap:atctf <dig> construct  resembled 35s:atctf <dig> plants  <cit> . specifically, the plants grew normally and produced pollen, but exhibited reduced female fertility. a ctf7:atctf7∆b construct  was also created and transformed into atctf7-1+/–plants. the native ctf <dig> promoter is expressed at low levels throughout the plant  <cit> . wild type plants containing the ctf7:atctf7∆b construct exhibited normal growth and development and normal fertility levels . no alterations were observed in six different transgenic lines over six generations. atctf7- <dig> plants containing the ctf7:atctf7∆b construct were obtained in t <dig> populations, but at frequencies  much lower than expected  if the construct complemented the atctf7- <dig> mutation. while these plants were dwarf, they grew better than atctf7- <dig> plants . somewhat similar to 35s:atctf7∆b plants, plant morphology varied between plants with some plants appearing acaulescence or producing fewer rosette leaves. the plants produced approximately  <dig> ovules per silique; however they failed to set seed; siliques contained aborted ovules resembling atctf7- <dig> plants . therefore, the defects observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants are caused by high-level expression of atctf7∆b and not the presence of the ntap tag. rather, the presence of the ntap appears to reduce the severity of the alterations, either by reducing the stability or activity of the protein, possibly by affecting its interaction with other proteins. further, expression of a truncated version of ctf <dig>  missing the b motif, can restore some vegetative growth to atctf7- <dig> plants; however the plants are still completely sterile. therefore, an intact acetyltransferase domain is required for full ctf <dig> activity.

discussion
the acetylation of cohesin complexes at conserved lysine residues by ctf7/eco <dig> plays an essential role in the establishment of cohesion during s phase and therefore nuclear division. consistent with this, ctf7/eco <dig> null mutations are typically lethal. organisms expressing altered ctf7/eco <dig> levels or point mutations in the protein typically display relatively normal levels of cohesin during nuclear division, but exhibit a range of developmental alterations. for example, mutations in the n-terminus of the protein typically lead to defects in cohesion and often chromosome loss during mitosis  <cit> . in contrast certain mutations in the c-terminal acetyltransferase domain of yeast ctf7/eco <dig> have little effect on s-phase cohesion and chromosome segregation, but cause an increased sensitivity to dna-damaging agents. likewise, roberts syndrome in humans has been linked to point mutations in esco <dig>  cells from patients with roberts syndrome are typically hypersensitive to dna-damaging agents and show premature centromere separation; however, only 10–20% of cells show abnormal mitosis  <cit> . finally, numerous studies have shown that cohesin mutations or reductions in cohesin levels result in transcriptional alterations that can have far-ranging developmental consequences  <cit> .

generally similar results have been obtained from studies on ctf <dig> in plants. arabidopsis plants heterozygous for a t-dna insertion in atctf <dig> grow normally but produce approximately 25% aborted seeds, consistent with the conclusion that ctf <dig> is an essential protein  <cit> . likewise knockdown of atctf <dig> mrna levels leads to growth retardation and defective sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . however, unlike other organisms, homozygous atctf <dig> plants have been detected at very low frequencies  <cit> . atctf <dig> plants exhibit a wide range of developmental defects, including extreme dwarfism and sterility.

in our current study we show that high-level expression of a truncated form of atctf <dig> results in reduced fertility and dramatic alterations in vegetative growth. specifically, plants that express a 35s:ntap:atctf7∆299– <dig> construct exhibit defects in male and female meiocytes, with female reproduction being affected more dramatically. male meiocytes exhibited chromosome fragmentation and uneven chromosome segregation during meiosis ii that resulted in abnormal pollen development and ultimately pollen abortion. ovules contained abnormal megasporocyte-like cells during pre-meiosis, megaspores that experienced elongated and aborted meiosis and defective megaspores and embryo sacs that arrested at various stages. a broad range of vegetative defects was also observed beginning in t <dig> generations of atctf7∆b transgenic plants. the appearance of these defects was stochastic and inherited in a non-mendelian fashion. comparison of atctf7∆b transgenic plants with atctf <dig> rnai and atctf <dig> plants and ctf7/eco <dig> mutants in other organisms suggests that ctf <dig> may have multiple roles in the cell.

reproductive defects in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants differ from those in atctf7rnai and atctf <dig> plants
inactivation of atctf <dig> by t-dna insertion or a reduction in atctf <dig> levels by atctf7-rnai lead to alterations in chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion during early meiotic prophase followed by defects in homologous chromosome pairing and segregation later in meiosis  <cit> . the effect of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b on male meiocytes was less severe and occurred later in meiosis. the first noticeable defect was the appearance of lagging and broken chromosomes during telophase i . twenty or more individual chromosomes were often observed beginning at metaphase ii, suggesting that cohesion might be prematurely lost. overexpression of atctf7∆b did not have a noticeable effect on the initial establishment of cohesion, as the distribution of syn <dig> on meiotic chromosomes was normal throughout prophase . likewise, chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion and homologous chromosome pairing were normal during male meiotic prophase in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants. this suggests that atctf7∆b does not affect the bulk of meiotic cohesin complexes to a significant extent, but rather may alter centromeric cohesin levels, or possibly cohesin interactions with sgo <dig> or patronus  <cit> .

in contrast to male reproduction, the effect of 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b on female reproduction are observed earlier and are more variable than those in atctf <dig> and atctf <dig> rnai plants. over expression of atctf <dig> from the 35s promoter or knockdown of atctf <dig> using rnai blocks early ovule development, typically at fg <dig> or fg <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, atctf <dig> ovules in atctf7+/–plants develop normally, but arrest soon after fertilization  <cit> . in all three situations the alterations are relatively uniform with arrest occurring at a specific developmental stage. in contrast, 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b causes pleiotropic ovule/seed defects. ntap:atctf7∆b lines displayed a wide range of defects, including additional abnormal cells adjacent to gametic cells, delayed/arrested meiosis, the production of functional megaspore-like cells of which some are mis-positioned, and delayed and altered embryo sac development. although alterations were commonly first observed prior to and during meiosis, most megaspores progressed to fg <dig> or fg <dig> before arresting .

35s:ntap:atctf7∆b leads to defects consistent with epigenetic alterations
35s:ntap:atctf7∆b lines exhibited relatively normal vegetative growth and development for the first two generations. however, severe vegetative abnormalities began to appear starting in the t <dig> or t <dig> generations of different lines. the defects, which included dwarf plants, fused stems and disrupted phyllotaxis , varied between lines and between progeny of the same line. the proportion of plants exhibiting vegetative alterations as well as the severity of the vegetative alterations increased in successive generations. it is interesting to note that phenotypic variability is very common in rbs patients  <cit> .

the delayed appearance of vegetative defects and the increased frequency of defects in subsequent generations could result from the accumulation of defects in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants. consistent with this possibility is the observation that ctf7/eco <dig> mutations are commonly associated with sensitivity to dna damaging agents  <cit> . as expected, both 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b and atctf <dig> plants contain elevated transcript levels for dna repair and recombination genes   <cit> . while the vegetative defects in 35s:ntap:atctf <dig> plants may result from spontaneous mutations, the situation is clearly more complex as the dwarf phenotype is not inherited in a mendelian fashion . when dwarf plants were selfed they produced a mixture of dwarf and non-dwarf, reduced fertile plants. further, the frequency of dwarfs in the progeny of selfed dwarf plants was similar to the frequency of dwarf plants resulting from selfing of non-dwarf plants. this raised the possibility that epigenetic alterations may be present in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants. consistent with this possibility is our observation that transcript levels of mu <dig>  copia  <dig> and solo ltr were increased between five  and  <dig> fold  in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants . subtle changes were observed in the transcript levels of several sirna associated genes. ago <dig>  rdr <dig> and mir <dig> transcript levels were reduced approximately 40-60% while ago <dig> was elevated slightly. hda <dig> and rdm <dig> transcripts were also decreased approximately 50% .

our observation that epigenetic alterations may be present in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants is consistent with the alterations we observe in female reproduction. recent studies have shown that embryo sacs are enriched for transcripts of proteins involved in rna metabolism and transcriptional regulation, and that they display distinct epigenetic regulatory mechanisms  <cit> . disruption of genes in small rna regulatory pathways, such as ago <dig>  ago <dig>  dicer-like <dig>  and meiosis arrested at leptotene <dig> , leads to multiple gametic cells at premeiosis, abnormal meiotic divisions, gametic cell fate alterations and twin female gametophytes  <cit> . for example, mutations in ago <dig>  which participates in small rna silencing by cleaving endogenous mrnas, results in additional gametic cells in pre-meiotic ovules, which may skip meiosis and twin female gametophytes in post-meiotic ovules  <cit> . several of these defects are observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b ovules before and during meiosis. moreover, ago <dig> participates in the epigenetically regulated silencing of tes  <cit> . at this time it is not clear if the apparent epigenetic alterations we observed are the direct result of high-level ntap:atctf7∆b expression or a secondary effect. for example, it is possible that ntap:atctf7∆b expression directly affects the expression of genes involved in epigenetic regulation. the involvement of cohesin complexes in transcriptional regulation is well documented in other organisms  <cit> . it is also possible that the changes we observe are an indirect effect of ntap:atctf7∆b expression. for example, previous studies have shown that eco1/ctf <dig> mutations result in defects in nucleolar integrity, rrna production, ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae and human  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mutations in genes participating in mrna production and rrna/ribosome biogenesis slow mitotic progression in female gametophytes and result in pleiotropic defects in embryo sacs  <cit> . for example, mutations in slow-walker <dig> , which participates in 18s pre-rrna processing, results in asynchronous megagametophyte development, and embryo sac arrest over a wide range of stages  <cit> . likewise, mutations in ribosomal protein genes lead to defects in inflorescence, leaf and plant stature in arabidopsis, similar to those observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants  <cit> . therefore, many of the alterations we observe in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants could be the result of alterations in rrna biogenesis or ribosome biogenesis, which in turn could indirectly impact epigenetic pathways.

atctf7∆b likely acts on several levels
the alterations observed in 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants appear to result from the presence of high levels of atctf7∆b and not a reduction of native atctf <dig> levels or the presence of the ntap. 35s:atctf7∆b plants exhibit similar, if not more dramatic phenotypes than 35s:ntap:atctf7∆b plants, indicating that the ntap is not responsible for the observed phenotypes. likewise, expression studies show that in addition to high atctf7∆b transcript levels, transgenic plants also contain elevated levels of native atctf <dig> transcripts . therefore, the 35s:atctf7∆b construct does not cause co-suppression. consistent with this are the apparently normal syn <dig> cohesin patterns observed in male meiocytes . interestingly, the elevated levels of native atctf <dig> transcript suggest that the cellular cohesion status is altered to some extent in atctf7∆b plants and that a feedback loop exists to monitor and maintain cohesion levels in plants.

high-level expression of atctf7∆b appears to exert a dominant negative effect, resulting in a relatively wide range of alterations. less clear is how high level expression of atctf7∆b exerts its effect or if the alterations we observe are all related. deletion of the last  <dig> amino acids of the acetyltransferase domain is expected to eliminate most of the actyltransferase activity. high-level expression of the protein may directly compete with native atctf <dig> for cohesin substrates resulting in an overall reduction or redistribution of cohesin levels throughout the genome. these changes could in turn result in a wide range of transcriptional alterations, similar to the situation observed in other organisms  <cit> . while this is the most-likely effect, it may not explain all of the observed alterations. for example, to our knowledge apparent epigenetic alterations have not been observed in either atctf <dig> rnai or atctf <dig> plants  <cit> . therefore, it is also possible that the  <dig> amino acid deletion alters acetyltransferase specificity such that the protein acts on off targets. for example, ctf <dig> has been shown to not acetylate histones; however if altered substrate specificity resulted in the acetylation of histones, then changes in chromatin structure could produce some of the alterations we observe. finally, the possibility also exists that the deletion may alter the interaction of atctf <dig> with other proteins, either directly or indirectly involved in maintaining chromatin structure. further experiments are required to determine how specifically atctf7∆b is acting, why male and female reproduction respond differently to alterations in atctf <dig> levels and what role, if any atctf <dig> plays in epigenetic regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
proper levels of atctf <dig> are critical for proper plant growth and development with female gametophytes being most sensitive to changes in atctf <dig> activity. high level expression of ntap:atctf7∆b results in pleiotropic defects in reproduction and vegetative growth. high levels of atctf7∆b may affect small rna processing, which in turn appears to result in epigenetic alterations. these results indicate that ctf <dig> may play multiple roles in plant cells.
