BACKGROUND
folliculogenesis is the result of series of complex and coordinated processes, which include morphological and functional changes in different types of follicular cells and their interactions. sequential recruitment, selection and growth of the follicles, atresia, ovulation and luteolysis are dynamically regulated events that occur on a cyclical basis within the ovary. these processes are under control of closely coordinated endocrine and paracrine factors to develope a number of ovulatory follicles that are species and breed dependent  <cit> . all those events entail substantial changes and balance between many processes such as the cell cycle, cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, steroidogenesis and atresia to determine the ultimate fate of follicles. all of these steady state cyclic changes are controlled by tightly regulated expression and interaction of a multitude of genes in different compartments of the ovary  to facilitate oocyte development  <cit> .

in oogenesis and embryo development, there are different mechanisms regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. these include events of mrna adenylation and deadenylation, the cap structure at the 5' end of the mrna and the effective action of mrna binding factors  <cit> . recently, a new post-transcriptional gene regulation is opened up after promising discovery of hundreds of mirnas in different mammalian species. diverse expression pattern of mirnas and high number of their potential target mrnas suggests their involvement in the regulation of various developmentally related genes at post-transcriptional level  <cit> . the tiny  and single-stranded mirnas are derived from primary transcripts termed as "pri-mirnas", which have an rna hairpin structure of 60- <dig> nt with a mature mirna in one of the two strands. this hairpin in turn is cleaved from the pri-mirna in the nucleus by the double-strand-specific ribonuclease, drosha  <cit> . the resulting precursor mirna  is transported to the cytoplasm via a process that involves exportin- <dig>  <cit>  and subsequently cleaved by dicer  <cit>  to generate a short, double-stranded  rna duplex. one of the strands of the mirna duplex is incorporated into a protein complex termed rna induced silencing complex . risc is guided by the incorporated mirna strand to mrnas containing complementary sequences in 3' untranslated region, which primarily results in inhibition of mrna translation  <cit> . those mrnas which are repressed by mirnas are further stored in the cytoplasmic foci called p-bodies  <cit> .

several studies have shown the involvement of mirnas in animal development. inhibition of mirna biogenesis has resulted in developmental arrest in mouse and fish  <cit> . similarly, loss of important mirna processing machinery, dicer <dig> resulted in female infertility in mouse  <cit> . targeted knockdown of mir-17-5p and let-7p in wild type mice revealed impaired corpus luteum  angiogenesis and decreased serum progesterone levels. in the same study, injection of these mirnas revealed the restoration of vasculature within the cl and increased progesterone levels  <cit> . in addition to loss-of-function approach, efforts have been done to identity mirnas by cloning. for example, small rna-cdna libraries from the ovaries of 2-wk-old and adult mice have generated a number of mirnas with potential role in ovarian function  <cit> . subsequent study on ovarian mirnas in mouse showed the post-transcriptional regulation of ctbp <dig> gene by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in cultured granulosa cells  <cit> . in addition to mirna, several other non-coding small rnas including rapirnas, napirnas, rasirnas and tncrnas are identified and reported in different species  <cit> .

bio-informatic approaches and construction of small rna-cdna libraries from bovine adipose tissue, mammary gland, embryo, thymus, small intestine, mesenteric lymph node and abomasum lymph node have identified most of presently annotated bovine mirnas  <cit> . the number of bovine mirnas  in comparison to human , chicken , mouse , chimpanzee , rhesus monkey  in mirbase  <dig>  are inadequate to disclose global mirnas regulation of gene expression for various biological functions and disease conditions. recently, we have shown the dynamics of mirnas expression during bovine oocyte maturation in vitro using heterologous approach  <cit> . this together with previous report in mouse supports the possible role of mirnas during follicular development and oocyte growth. identifying entire set as well as ovary-specific mirnas may lead to understanding mirna-guided gene regulation in the ovary. so, the present study has been conducted to get insight into the mirna population present in bovine ovary by investigating their characteristics, expression pattern and features of their target genes.

RESULTS
description of the bovine ovarian small rna library
to identify mirnas in the ovary, rnas of  <dig> to  <dig> nt in length from bovine ovarian small rnas  were purified, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. about  <dig> concatemer clones were sequenced to generate  <dig> sequences . of these  <dig> small rna-cdna sequences were beyond the expected range of nucleotides  in length. only sequences of  <dig> nt or more in length were subjected to detail analysis. distribution of different lengths of nucleotide sequences found in this library is presented in figure  <dig>  we categorized all identified sequences according to their properties as determined by in-silico analysis based on the criteria reported elsewhere for different types of small rnas  <cit> . the  <dig> sequences identified in the library represented 41% mirnas, 12% mrna, 12% rrna,  <dig> % trna,  <dig> % repeat associated sirna,  <dig> % small antisense rna,  <dig> % tiny noncoding rna, 1% small nuclear rna and  <dig> % sequences that did not match to bovine genome .

distinct mirnas identified in the bovine ovary
in cdna library a total of  <dig> sequences were found to be mirna like molecules, of which  <dig> revealed distinct mirnas . out of these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> were found to be reported in mirbase  <dig>  for different species including bovine,  <dig> are registered only for other species and  <dig> were completely new. of these  <dig> new bovine mirnas,  <dig> mirnas were identical or differed by only one or two nucleotides from known mammalian mirnas. we denoted all the new mirnas starting with prefix 'bomir' followed by their homologue mirna number or by clone name in case of no sequence homology. already annotated mirnas were named as they were stated in mirbase.
































a: cloned sequence is homolog to has-mir  <dig> but not to bta-mir- <dig>  may bta-mir- <dig> presented in mirbase v.  <dig> is bta-mir-22*, b: cloned sequence is homologue to has-mir- <dig> but not to bta-mir- <dig>  may bta-mir- <dig> presented in mirbase v.  <dig> is bta-mir-140*

c: sequence is smaller than bta-mir-193a and has different genomic locus. d: sequence does not match to bovine genome, e: genomic location presenting chromosome number with start and end position along with sense/antisense orientation by 1/- <dig> of cloned mature sequence. conservation pattern of the predicted precursor sequences from flanking bovine genome sequence is indicated by- f: found in more than  <dig> mammalian species, g: present at least in  <dig> species, h: only in bovine.

two mirnas, namely: mir-22/22* and 140/140* which are cloned from 5' fold back arm of the hairpin precursor, have shown exact match to human mirnas but not to bovine as annotated in mirbase. so, previously annotated bta-mir- <dig> and  <dig> seem to be mir-22* and mir-140*, respectively. the number of times that each mirna cloned in the library ranged from  <dig> clones for let-7b to a single clone  for  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas. all in all,  <dig> of the  <dig> mirnas were cloned for three or more times .

the corresponding bovine genomic sequences and their locations were identified for each mirna. the 5' or 3' flanking genomic sequences were then tested for the ability to fold into canonical ~70-nt mirna precursor hairpin structures by using the mfold web server  <cit> . small rna clones with proper positioning within an arm of the hairpin suggest that they have been excised during dicer processing in the cells. nearly in all of those cases, sequences were found to be conserved in different species including the predicted precursors . the bomir- <dig>  which could not be located in bovine genome, was found to be cloned for five times in the library and share sequence homology with already identified mirna in other species.

genomic distribution, properties and clustering of new mirnas
genomic locations and properties of the new mirnas are shown in table  <dig>  all newly identified bovine mirnas  are corresponded to  <dig> distinct loci. putative precursor hairpin structures have been predicted for all these  <dig> loci using genomic sequences flanked from candidate mirnas . thirty three of these are found to be encoded by single copy mirna genes, whereas the other five  have multiple loci in the bovine genome . the analysis of the genomic positions of  <dig> sequences corresponding to  <dig> distinct new mirna genes showed that the majority  are localized to intergenic regions and the rest corresponded to the intragenic regions in either sense or antisense orientation . however,  <dig> sequences are found to be exclusively from known intronic region.

characterization of our mirnas was done based on the annotation in the bovine genome data base ensembl 52: btau_ <dig>   <cit> . bomir-f0522-3p and bomir-a4052-5p were mapped to both intergenic and intronic locations. bomir-f0132-5p , bomir-e2664-3p  and bomir-a4052-5p  are originated from the exons of protein-coding genes. while searching the genomic location for all mirnas, we found six new genomic locations for annotated mirnas like bta-mir- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  199a and let-7b .

all the  <dig> new genomic loci were found to be distributed in  <dig> chromosomes  namely: chr.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, eight loci were found to be mapped to unknown chromosome in the ensembl 52: btau_ <dig>  . among all newly identified loci, eight mirna genes were found to be located on chr.  <dig> and five mirnas found on chr.  <dig> and  <dig>  further analysis of the already annotated mirnas and the newly predicted loci has revealed six mirnas gene clusters which were mapped within <  <dig> kb. this clusters are i) bta-mir-10a and bomir-a <dig> on chr. 19; ii) bta-mir-23b, bta-mir-27b and bta-mir-24- <dig> on chr. 8; iii) bta-let-7a- <dig> and let 7b-2-3p on chr. 5; iv) bomir-a4052- <dig> and bomir-c <dig> on chr. 18; v) bta-mir-487a, bta-mir-487-b, bomir- <dig> and bomir- <dig> on chr. 21; vi) bomir-c0533- <dig> and bomir-a4052- <dig> on chr.  <dig> 

to determine whether our new mirnas are conserved among closely related species, we have searched for homology for precursor sequence in the ensembl genome databases. results revealed that  <dig> precursor loci  were found to be conserved in at least six species. while five mirnas  were found to be conserved in at least two species,  <dig> mirna loci were specific to bovine. all of the newly cloned mirnas were found to be conserved as mature sequences in the genome of different species. thermo-dynamically stable hairpin structures were found for those conserved and new mirnas as shown in additional file  <dig> 

other small rnas and their genomic properties found in the library
analysis of small rna library in the present study has enabled us to identify  <dig> different endogenous sirnas. we categorized them broadly into two groups, namely:  <dig> sequences composed of  <dig> distinct rnas derived from genomic repetitive region as repeat associated small interfering rnas  and other  <dig> rnas associated to non repetitive regions as non-repeat associated small interfering rnas . according to their sequence properties  <dig> out of  <dig> nasirnas were found to be natural antisense transcripts with ~ <dig> nt in length. therefore, since they seem to be endogenous sirnas, we denoted them as small antisense rnas  and the rest  <dig> as tiny non-coding rnas . size ranges for rasirnas were 18- <dig> nt , which did not revealed a sharp size distribution characteristic. however, for the santrnas and tncrnas the size distribution was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nt, respectively. cloned rasirnas were found to be distributed on various chromosomes and mapped to repeat sequences mostly corresponding to retrotransposons in both sense and antisense orientation. total numbers of hits for  <dig> rasirnas were  <dig> . seventy five percent of the rasirnas were found to have preference for uridine and adenine residues in either 3' or 5' end position. while seven of the santrnas were precisely mapped to intergenic region, six fitted to intronic region. all the  <dig> santrnas were cloned as antisense orientation to the genome or intron of the protein coding genes on  <dig> different chromosomes.

secondary structure analysis of all santrnas revealed no characteristic hairpin as found for the mirnas. while eleven tncrnas were mapped to intergenic region, five were mapped to intronic and two to exonic regions. two of the seventeen tncrnas were predicted to form potential fold back structures like the mirnas. however, these putative tncrna precursor structures deviated significantly from the mirna hairpins in key features and they were found to be poorly conserved in closely related species.

detection and expression of mirnas in the ovary and other bovine tissues
the expression of all new mirnas including nine annotated mirnas  in  <dig> different bovine tissues were analyzed using semi-quantitative rt-pcr . as small rnas were cloned in the library derived from all compartments of the ovary, samples from ovarian cortex, cumulus cells and matured corpus luteum were used to determine the sub-cellular expression profile of the new mirna using rt-pcr . this is because of two facts: firstly, the bovine ovary is continuously changing throughout the process of folliculogenesis and secondly, the distinct nature of function of intra-ovarian cells and tissues compartments in the ovary.

expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas including all new mirnas in multiple tissues by pcr approach. amplicons were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. 5s rrnas and u <dig> rna were used as a loading control. relative band intensity was categorized into four groups like '+++' for strong signal, '++' for medium signal, '+' for weak signal or smear like product and '-' for not detected by comparing the expression signal of each mirna to the expression level of 5s rrna and u <dig> rna. a: ovarian cortex with no visible corpus luteum, b: ovary from fetus at about 5th month of pregnancy, c: mature corpus luteum from the same ovary.

of all  <dig> mirnas   <dig> were detected in both ovarian cells and multiple tissues. five mirnas  were found to be expressed at similar level in all experimental tissues. seven mirnas  were found to be expressed at relatively higher levels in ovarian cortical portion . on the other hand, all undetected or less expressed mirnas in ovarian cortex were found to be highly expressed in cumulus cells or corpus luteum. most of the mirnas were found to be differentially expressed between adult ovarian tissues and fetal ovary. among them bta-mir-15b, bomir- <dig>  bomir- <dig>  bomir-c <dig> and bomir-d <dig> were highly expressed in the fetal ovary compared to that of adult ovarian cortex. however, bta-mir-29a, bta-mir- <dig> and bomir-f <dig> were found to be expressed at higher level in the adult ovarian cortex than that of the fetal ovary . bta-mir-125b, bta-mir- <dig>  bomir- <dig>  bomir- <dig>  bomir-h <dig>  bomir-f <dig>  bomir-c <dig> and bomir-a <dig> were found to be expressed at very low level or not detected at all in the ovarian cortex. however, their abundance was higher in the cumulus cells and matured corpus luteum. the expression of bta-mir- <dig> was detected exclusively in the cumulus cells. in addition, higher expression of bta-mir-125b, bomir- <dig>  bomir- <dig> and bomir-f <dig> was also observed in the cumulus cells. the expression of bomir- <dig>  bomir-h <dig>  bomir-c <dig> and bomir-a <dig> was higher in the corpus luteum.

moreover, higher expression level of different mirnas in various reproductive tissues was also observed. this includes bomir- <dig> in the oviduct; bta-mir- <dig>  bomir-f <dig> and bomir-g <dig> in the uterus; and bta-mir-29a, bomir- <dig>  bta-mir- <dig>  bta-mir- <dig>  bomir- <dig> in the placenta. all these investigated mirnas were detected at least in one of the non-ovarian somatic tissues including heart, liver, lung and spleen . the rt-pcr analysis did not confirm the expression of three novel mirnas  in any of the tissues under investigation .

in order to elucidate the cellular localization of one mirna, bta-mir-29a was selected due to its differential expression between adult and fetal ovary, which are distinct in their functional activity. accordingly, in-situ localization of this mirna in the sections of bovine ovarian follicle revealed its expression in the different intra-ovarian cells  of different stages of development including primordial, primary, growing and matured/tertiary follicles . stable expression was detected in the whole mount cumulus-oocyte-complexes derived from the follicles of more than  <dig> mm in diameter. in the semi-quantitative rt-pcr data, expression of this mirna was found in the cortex region of the adult ovary where follicles with cumulus cells are residing. moreover, the expression of this mirna was detected further until early stage of corpus luteum , but very low or no expression in the matured corpus luteum .

prediction and functional categorization of cloned mirna targets
the goal of this prediction and analysis was to find the major biological processes and signaling pathways in the ovary that are most likely affected by a group of mirnas. even though there were many potential target genes predicted for the cloned mirnas, several filtering and screening procedures  have enabled us to generate a comprehensive target list consisting of  <dig> potential genes from all the predicted targets . from this screened target set, we found that let-7b, mir-15b, mir-18a, mir-29a, mir- <dig>  mir-125b, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-199a and mir- <dig> to have the highest number and overlapping targets . interestingly, we found that all of these targeting mirnas were represented at higher frequency in our constructed library.

detailed gene ontology  analysis of the screened and sub-sets of mirnas target genes were found to be associated with reproductive system development, function and disorders. these include cell cycle, morphology, cell death, cell to cell signaling, cellular growth, development and proliferation, dna replication, recombination & repair, endocrine system disorder and different pathways underlying the ovarian functions. to further elucidate the specific functions of these genes, a detailed pathway analysis was performed using ingenuity pathway analysis  for all target sets  as well as for the sub-set of genes .

eleven top mirnas targeting highest number of genes from our screened and filtered all predicted targets and their top gene ontology categories and pathways based on fisher' exact p-value  are presented in the table. for detail figures see additional file  <dig> 

discussion
identification of small rnas
micrornas play an integral part of animal gene regulatory networks as one of the most abundant classes of gene regulators. they are estimated to comprise 1-5% of animal genes  <cit>  or a given genome could encode nearly thousands of mirnas  <cit> . moreover, a typical mirna regulates hundreds of target genes  <cit>  and altogether they could target a large proportion of genes up to 30% of the genome  <cit> . changes in the expression of even a single mirna could have a significant impact on the outcome of diverse cellular activities regulated by the product of those genes. beyond the strict conservation of mirnas across different species, some mirnas appear to be species specific  <cit> . compared with computational or heterologus approaches, direct cloning has the advantage of identifying non-conserved and new mirnas.

our cloning and expression analysis led to the identification of  <dig> mirnas out of which  <dig> are new in bovine. mature sequences were found to be conserved in closely related species, but when considering precursor sequence only 51% was found to be conserved in human, mouse, rat, dog, horse and also in other non-mammalian vertebrates. however, in the present study,  <dig> mirna precursors corresponding to  <dig> genomic loci were found to be not conserved . this could be either due to the lack of sequences in draft genome assembly or these mirnas are bovine specific. the genomic properties of our new mirnas showed that they are derived from exon, intron and intergenic region. this may suggest that these mirnas can be transcribed in parallel with their host transcripts. in addition, two different transcription classes of mirnas  recognized here may require somewhat different mechanisms of bio-genesis as stated previously  <cit> . discovery of six clusters composed of  <dig> mirna genes on six chromosomes showed that these closely located host genes may share the same cis-regulatory elements and the mirnas within the clusters might be expressed in the same tissues or at the same developmental or physiological stage.

the representation of many known and novel mirnas in this single library indicates the presence of potential mirnas, which are not yet discovered. both in-depth analysis of the existing library and cell-type-specific analysis of individual mirnas will give insight into the functional mechanisms and pathways involved in ovarian folliculogenesis in particular and female fertility in general.

along with the mirnas several types of endogenous small interfering rnas were identified in the present study. among them,  <dig> distinct rasirnas represented the frequent class of small rnas. thirteen rnas were classified as small antisense rnas, while  <dig> small rnas were tiny non-coding rnas. the small rna cloning and profiling from another study revealed less representation of that group of rasirnas compared to the mirnas  <cit> . the properties we identified for rasirnas support the notion that they are presumably emerged from dsrna produced by annealing of sense and antisense transcripts that contain repeat sequences related to transposable elements  <cit> . these rasirnas are known to repress the repeat sequences at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level and maintain a centromeric heterochromatic structure  <cit> . identity and properties of new types of small rnas in the present study showed the presence of diverse modes of small rna-mediated gene regulation in bovine ovary, as reported in other species  <cit> . therefore, identification and characterization of other small rnas and their expression patterns are important for elucidating detailed gene regulatory networks involved in the ovary. so, all these endogenous small interfering rnas need to be further characterized to elucidate their cellular functions.

expression of mirnas in diverse tissue types
expression analysis of  <dig> mirnas in different ovarian cells and tissues types has enabled us to determine their site of action in terms of tissue specific abundance as well as functional regulation . we have detected nearly all of these mirnas in at least one part of the entire ovary and other somatic tissues. in the present study, some mirnas appear to be extremely tissue specific. for example; bomir-c <dig> and bomir-f <dig> were found to be exclusively expressed in ovarian tissues suggesting their potential role in ovary-specific mirna-dependent regulatory processes. five mirnas  were found to be highly abundant in the cumulus cells and four  in corpus luteum. these cumulus enriched mirnas in the present study may represent those mirnas with potential association with the regulation of cumulus secreted factors, which are important for cumulus-oocyte communication and subsequent oocyte development. similar study in mouse showed hormonal regulation of mirnas expression in preovulatory mural granulosa cell  <cit> .

altered expression of various ovary related genes was reported in ovaries from fetal, new born and adult animals  <cit> . furthermore, alteration in expression of small rnas has been addressed at different stages of mouse ovary  <cit> . similarly, in the present study we found differential expression of mir-29a, bomir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  bomir-f <dig> and bomir-f <dig> in the ovarian cortical portion between fetal and adult cows. this may indicate their possible involvement in regulating follicular development in the adult cyclic ovarian function. this notion was further supported by higher detection of mir-29a in different follicular cells  of adult ovary by in situ hybridization  and higher expression in cumulus cells by rt-pcr but no detection in the fetal ovary. the expression of mirnas in ovarian cells is reported to be regulated by fsh and lh/hcg  <cit>  which functions in the cyclic ovary but not in fetal ovary  <cit> . moreover, most of the targets predicted for this mirna  are known to be involved in various cyclic adult ovarian functions.

noticeable expression level of mir-29a was found in different phases of corpus luteum  development. according to rt-pcr and in situ hybridization results, expression of mir-29a was detected in the early phase cl but not in mid phase  cl. these two phases of cl development are known to vary in multiple aspects of luteal physiology, angiogenesis and sensitivity to luteolytic actions, which are accompanied by differential expression of multiple genes  <cit> . bovine corpus luteum is reported to be resistant to luteolysis by exogenous pgf2α in early stage of cl  due to differential expression of genes associated with the pgf2α receptor  <cit> . considering these facts and restricted expression of mir-29a in early phase of cl in the present study, it is possible to suggest that mir-29a is involved in gene regulatory action during early phase of cl. all in all, our results on mir-29a may elucidate the potential involvement of this regulatory mirna in growth and differentiation of cumulus cells, endocrine regulation of theca cells and early luteinisation in cyclic ovary.

cloning, determining potential secondary structures and expression analysis of all new mirnas in multiple tissues indicate their tissue specific existence and regulation of gene expression. only  <dig> % of the new mirnas could not be detected by the rt-pcr procedure in various reproductive tissues. this may be due to the fact that these transcripts were cloned at lower frequency  showing their lower abundance and subsequent difficulty to detect them  <cit> . in general, the expression profiling analysis in the present study revealed that our cloned mirnas were either ubiquitously expressed in multiple tissues or preferentially expressed in a few tissues including the intra-ovarian cells and tissues.

features of predicted target genes
multiple genes contributing to mammalian folliculogenesis have been identified in mouse knockout study  <cit> . primarily, oocyte-specific transcriptional regulators such as figla, nobox, sohlh <dig> and lhx <dig>  oocyte-secreted factors such as gdf <dig> and bmp <dig>  as well as genes expressed in the granulosa and cumulus cells  were found to initiate and control follicular growth  <cit> . among the key intra-ovarian factors, the transforming growth factor β  family members, of which bone morphogenetic protein- <dig> have been identified as regulators of primordial germ cell generation  <cit> .

in response to fsh, the granulosa cell-derived factors such as kit ligand, transforming growth factor alfa  and epidermal growth factor  activate the resting follicular growth. the interactions between ovarian germ and somatic cells  and expression of several intra-ovarian autocrine/paracrine regulators  are the major contributing factors in the ovary leading to preantral and antral follicles development  <cit> .

during follicle growth, igf system works in synergy with gonadotrophins  to regulate proliferation and differentiation of granulosa and theca cells  <cit> . in addition, it has been shown that the processes of follicular dynamics  are associated with temporal changes of peripheral gonadotropins concentration and igf system  <cit> . all the above-mentioned genes are represented in our predicted and analyzed targets. altogether  <dig> genes were among potential target genes of our identified mirna. these target genes are already experimentally validated for potential ovary related functions in different mammalian species . interestingly, several well-known target genes including irs <dig>  igfbp <dig>  dnmt3a, hoxa <dig>  tnf, etc. which are identified by our new screening approach, were already validated in wet lab experiments and reported as targets of multiple mirnas   <cit> . accordingly these studies have elucidated the potential involvement of these mirnas in broad class of functions related to apoptosis, differentiation signal, cell differentiation, tumorogenesis, dna methylation and innate immune responses.

gonadotropins, intra-ovarian mediators and their receptors which are identified as target genes for our mirnas might mediate important intracellular actions necessary for normal follicular development and other ovarian functions. alterations in the expression of these mediators by mirnas will result in various ovarian dysfunctions causing infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome and tumorigenesis. recent evidences also support our hypothesis, where at least six of our  <dig> top ranked ovarian mirnas were found to be related to cancer or tumors in the ovary. for example, mir-199a, mir- <dig>  mir-125b and let- <dig> clusters were found to be the most differentially regulated mirnas in human ovarian cancer  <cit> . while mir- <dig>  <cit>  and mir-199a  <cit>  have recently been shown to be down-modulated in the tumor cells, the mir- <dig> is reported to be down-regulated in ovarian epithelial carcinomas  <cit> . furthermore, higher expression of mir-18a and lower expression of let-7b and mir-199a were shown to be correlated with serous ovarian carcinoma  <cit> . in another study, mir17-5p and let-7b were found to be involved in the regulation of development and function of the ovarian corpus luteum specially angiogenesis of corpus luteum  <cit> . interestingly, nearly all of these  <dig> selected mirnas  in the present study are reported to be differentially regulated in endometrium of women with and without endometriosis  <cit> . taken together, our findings and other evidences support the relevance of these  <dig> mirnas to ovarian physiology and may be the most important regulatory mirna group in ovary, as their predicted and analyzed target genes are involved in a broad range of signaling cascades and pathways of the ovarian function.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of distinct mirnas and other small rnas, with different expression patterns and various target genes in bovine ovary revealed the potential role of such mirnas in follicular development in particular and female fertility in general. further functional characterization of some selected mirnas including expression profiling and in situ localization in the ovarian follicles at different cyclic stages will supplement the results of this study and help to elucidate their specific roles in the ovarian function. the information we generated from this study will help to identify candidate mirnas targeting specific molecular and cellular pathways important for ovarian follicular development, atresia, ovulation as well as ovarian dysfunction.
