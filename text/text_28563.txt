BACKGROUND
anthocyanins are widely distributed water-soluble pigments belonging to the flavanoid group of phytochemicals. over  <dig> types of anthocyanins have been identified  <cit> . these mainly possess six common aglycones  and various types of glycosylated and acylated compounds  <cit> . anthocyanins protect plants from strong light, heavy metals, and pathogens, and play an important role in flowers  <cit> . as they have low toxicity and vary in color they are often used as healthier alternatives to synthetic colorants  <cit> . previous studies have confirmed that anthocyanins provide antioxidants for human health that protect against a broad range of diseases, including a high blood cholesterol level, cardiovascular disease, and ultraviolet radiation damage  <cit> .

carrots  are among the  <dig> most economically important vegetable crops grown worldwide  <cit> . carrot cultivars appear in five taproot color types: purple, orange, yellow, red, and white. although orange carrot cultivars  account for the majority of production, purple carrots  are enjoying increased popularity, largely because they contain high amounts of anthocyanin in their flesh taproots. purple carrot cultivars have existed for over 3000 years, and are much older than orange carrot cultivars  <cit> . anthocyanins from purple carrots are commonly used as natural food colorants in candies, ice cream, and beverages, this is because they remain stable when exposed to heat and light, and have increased ph values  <cit> . purple carrots mainly contain cyanidin-based anthocyanins; some cultivars also contain trace amounts of peonidin- or pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in their taproots  <cit> .

the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway has been extensively studied in numerous plant species, including bilberry , grape , apple , arabidopsis , mitchell petunia , and sweet potato   <cit> . two classes of genes participate in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway: structural genes and regulatory genes. structural genes encode enzymes that directly catalyze reaction steps leading to the formation of anthocyanins; the transcription of these genes is controlled by regulatory genes, such as myb, bhlh, and wd <dig> genes  <cit> . structural genes that participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis have been identified in mumerous plant species  <cit> . some functional genes participating in this pathway have also been identified in carrots; these include the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , chalcone synthase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase , dihydroflavonol 4-reductase , and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase  genes  <cit> . we described the presence of the udp-galactose: cyanidin 3-o-galactosyltransferase  in the purple carrot cultivars in our previous study  <cit> . however, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase , 4-coumaroyl-coenzyme a ligase , chalcone-flavonone isomerase , and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase  genes have not been identified in carrots.

to obtain insights into differences in anthocyanin biosynthesis between purple and non-purple carrot cultivars, we cloned six novel structural genes involved in anthocyanin biosyntheses from taproot-derived cdna. the expression patterns of  <dig> structural genes in the taproots of three purple and six non-purple carrot cultivars were analyzed at the transcriptional level. the accumulation of anthocyanins was determined in parallel. the aim of this work was to determine the stage at which the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway switches off, thus leading to loss of anthocyanins in non-purple carrot cultivars.

RESULTS
taproot color of nine carrot cultivars at different development stages
anthocyanins accumulate in different parts of carrot taproots at different development stages; this leads to taproots displaying a purple or dark color. in 60-day-old carrots, anthocyanins accumulated in the cortex and xylem of ‘deep purple’ and ‘purple 68’ cultivar taproots, but only in the cortex of ‘tianzi2hao’ . in the six other carrot cultivars, no purple or dark coloring was detected in the taproot. in 90- and 120-day-old carrots, anthocyanins accumulated in the cortex, phloem, and xylem of ‘deep purple’, ‘purple 68’, and ‘tianzi2hao’ taproots. in the six other carrot cultivars, no purple or dark coloring was detected in these taproot parts, with the exception of the hypocotyl-derived root part of 90- and 120-day-old ‘kuroda’, 90-day-old ‘sanhongliucun’, and 120-day-old ‘junchuanhong’; these displayed dark color in the epidermis when exposed to light . as hypocotyl-derived parts of the taproots of 120-day-old ‘sanhongliucun’ and 90-day-old ‘junchuanhong’ cultivars were not exposed to light, purple or dark coloring was not detectable in their epidermis.figure  <dig>

anthocyanin content in the taproots of nine carrot cultivars at different developmental stages
total anthocyanin content in the taproots of the three purple carrot cultivars  increased significantly during development . these cultivars accumulated anthocyanins more efficiently in their taproots between the 60- and 90-day-old stages than between the 90- and 120-day-old stages. of these three purple carrot cultivars, ‘purple 68’ showed the highest anthocyanin content in the taproots at all three stages. in the taproots of the three orange carrot cultivars , anthocyanin was not detected at the 60-day-old stage. at the 90-day-old stage, the anthocyanin content in ‘kuroda’ and ‘sanhongliucun’ taproots was  <dig>  mg/100 g fresh weight  and  <dig>  mg/100 g fw, respectively; anthocyanin was not detected in ‘junchuanhong’ taproots at this stage. the taproots of 120-day-old ‘kuroda’, ‘sanhongliucun’, and ‘junchuanhong’ contained  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mg/100 g fw anthocyanins, respectively. anthocyanins did not accumulate in the taproots of the three yellow carrot cultivars in any of the three stages.figure  <dig>

the pal <dig> and pal <dig>  chs <dig> and chs <dig>  and ldox <dig> and ldox <dig> genes were considered as allelic genes because they share very high identity in their nucleotide acid sequences ; furthermore, only one gene corresponding to each pair of genes was found in the carrotdb. therefore, only one pair of primers, specific to each pair of genes, was used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction .

expression of cyanidin-based anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in the taproot at the 60-day-old stage

transcript levels of pal <dig> and ca4h <dig> were lower than pal3/pal <dig> and ca4h <dig>  respectively, in the taproots of all carrot cultivars. transcript levels of 4cl <dig> in the taproots of ‘kuroda’, ‘junchuanhong’, ‘bejo1719’, ‘qitouhuang’, and ‘baiyu’ were higher than those of 4cl <dig>  but lower than observed in the taproots of ‘deep purple’, ‘purple 68’, ‘tianzi2hao’, and ‘sanhongliucun’. in the three purple carrot cultivars, mrna abundance of chs2/chs <dig> in the taproot was significantly lower than that of chs <dig>  in the six other carrot cultivars, chs2/chs <dig> showed similar mrna expression levels as chs <dig> in the taproots .

discussion
in many plants, anthocyanin biosynthesis can be light independent or light induced. the light-independent anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway has been investigated in other plant species, including apple and sweet potato  <cit> . light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis has been observed in several plant species, including apple, grape, and mitchell petunia  <cit> . in this work, purple carrot cultivars could produce rich anthocyanins in taproots light independently. in contrast, yellow carrot cultivars failed to produce anthocyanins in the taproots, while orange carrots could only produce small amounts of anthocyanins in the epidermis of hypocotyl-derived root parts light dependently. to determine genes involved in light-independent anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple carrots and those responsible for losses of light-independent anthocyanin production in non-purple carrots, we analyzed anthocyanin pathway structural genes in three purple and six non-purple cultivars.

some structural genes  involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis have been previously cloned, and their expression profiles analyzed under ultraviolet light  <cit> . our previous study identified that ucgt <dig> expressed in purple carrot cultivars  <cit> . in this study, six structural genes  present in purple  and non-purple  carrot cultivars were cloned and sequenced. pal3/pal <dig>  ca4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  chs <dig>  f3h <dig>  f3′h <dig>  dfr <dig>  and ldox1/ldox <dig> genes may be involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple carrots as these genes showed higher expression levels in purple carrots than non-purple carrots. chs <dig>  chi <dig>  f3h <dig>  f3′h <dig>  dfr <dig>  and ldox1/ldox <dig> genes were strongly correlated with the presence of anthocyanins, as indicated by high gene expression levels in the taproots of purple carrot cultivars but no or scarce expression in the taproots of non-purple carrot cultivars. this suggests that these genes predominantly lead to loss of anthocyanin production in non-purple carrot cultivars. a similar result was observed in sweet potatoes  <cit> . loss of anthocyanins in the taproots of non-purple carrots is possibly caused by inactivation of regulator genes such as myb, bhlh, and wd <dig> genes. future investigation will focus on transcription factors controlling expression of these structural genes to identify the key gene involved in anthocyanin production in purple carrot cultivars and responsible for anthocyanin loss in non-purple carrot cultivars.

the taproots of purple carrots are rich in anthocyanins, reaching a maximum of 175 mg/100 g fw in some cultivars  <cit> . in this study, anthocyanin content varied significantly in the taproots of the three purple carrot cultivars at the three different stages, as visually indicated by the degree of root coloring. anthocyanin content in 60-day-old stage taproots of the three purple carrot cultivars was comparable to previously reported for several genotypes of purple carrots  <cit> . in 90- and 120-day-old purple carrots, anthocyanin content was higher than previously reported, this may be because of the different growth conditions and harvest time of the carrots  <cit> ; anthocyanin accumulation in carrots is sensitive to variations in growth conditions, such as temperature, light, and nutrients  <cit> . anthocyanin contents in taproots of the three purple carrot cultivars at the 120-day-old stage were higher than those in strawberries, red onion, and red grapes but lower than that observed in blueberries  <cit> . anthocyanins accumulated in the epidermis of the hypocotyl-derived root part of the three orange carrot cultivars after they were exposed to light. this suggested that a light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway is found in these orange carrot cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
purple carrot cultivars produced rich amounts of anthocyanins in the taproots light independently, whereas non-purple cultivars did not. the anthocyanin content in purple carrot cultivars increased as root growth occurred. six novel candidate structural genes that existed in both purple and non-purple carrots were successfully cloned and sequenced. pal3/pal <dig>  ca4h <dig>  4cl <dig>  chs <dig>  chi <dig>  f3h <dig>  f3′h <dig>  dfr <dig>  and ldox1/ldox <dig> may participate in anthocyanin biosynthesis in the taproots of purple carrot cultivars. chs <dig>  chi <dig>  f3h <dig>  f3′h <dig>  dfr <dig>  and ldox1/ldox <dig> were unexpressed or scarcely expressed in non-purple carrots, thus may lead to the loss of light-independent anthocyanins production in orange and yellow carrots. our results provide new insights into anthocyanin biosynthesis in carrots at the molecular level and are of importance for other root vegetables.
