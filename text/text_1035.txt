BACKGROUND
by virtue of the recent development of massively parallel dna sequencing technologies, access to genomic composition has become easier than ever. with the advantage of exome sequencing, many studies have identified causal variants responsible for numerous disorders. exome sequencing provides a particularly powerful method with which to identify disease-causing single nucleotide variations  in mendelian disorders
 <cit> . though whole exome sequencing  has been used to successfully discover many genes that cause mendelian disorders, analysis of wes data remains challenging
 <cit> . an individual exome has more than  <dig>  variants compared with the reference genome. even in familial mendelian disorders, the overall success rate for identifying disease-causing genes is around 50%
 <cit> . thus, many of the potential reasons for failure in the wes approach need to be solved fully in order to realize the promise of wes for routine diagnosis of mendelian disorders.

filtering patient data against normal populations and inferring identity-by-descent  in family studies can enrich candidate genes
 <cit> . genetic linkage analysis has also been a powerful tool for isolating potential causal candidate variants. a two-step approach of linkage analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism  microarrays to detect high logarithm of odds  score regions and subsequent targeted re-sequencing of regions of interest has been utilized in many genomic studies to intensify the power of detection
 <cit> . classically, microsatellite markers have been used for linkage analysis, and now millions of dimorphic snp markers can be used to provide higher resolution in order to pinpoint candidate loci
 <cit> . currently, there are many efforts to use coding snp information from wes data to facilitate genetic linkage mapping. specifically, coding snp data from wes can be used to establish multiphasic exome analyses based on linkages and snvs
 <cit> .

copy number variation  has been implicated in both mendelian diseases
 <cit>  and common diseases such as obesity
 <cit>  and schizophrenia
 <cit> . the presence of large insertions or deletions in patients is typically investigated prior to snv analysis by karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization , and/or array comparative genome hybridization . estimation of cnv is a challenging aspect of wes analysis, in which local depths of coverage must be mapped to copy numbers. indeed, acgh has limitations in detecting high cnv regions. conversely, cnv data based on wes provides more accurate copy numbers because the depths of exon coverage from wes data vary linearly with real copy numbers
 <cit> . bioinformatics tools to analyze copy numbers from wes data are now publicly available
 <cit> .

nonsyndromic hearing loss  contributes to more than 70% of inherited cases of hearing loss. to date, approximately  <dig> genes have been shown to be causally related to nshl. many studies have identified more than  <dig> loci responsible for nshl; however,  <dig> loci have not yet been mapped to proper genes
 <cit> . the complexity of the auditory system may explain why so many genes and loci are linked to hearing loss. the genetic causes of hearing loss can be detected by sequence analysis, which helps clinicians and patients to delineate the basis of the disease. given that hearing loss in early childhood can affect linguistic development
 <cit> , it is important to improve current techniques for identifying genetic alterations that cause nshl. earlier identification of such alterations in patients and families may allow for better clinical management of nshl.

analysis of wes data can be expanded to obtain more information useful for identifying causative mutations in mendelian diseases. in this paper, in order to analyze wes data from an entire family, we applied three different methods, namely, cnv, linkage, and segregation analysis. by combining the results obtained from these methods, we efficiently identified a causative mutation from the family data. we applied this approach to wes data from a nshl family to identify candidate disease-causing variants.

RESULTS
clinical features of a nshl family
we identified a korean family with six members affected by nshl and seven unaffected members . pure tone audiometry  was performed on nine family members, three of whom  exhibited profound post-lingual hearing loss. the three members had normal cognitive function and no anomalous-looking features. they went through a battery of clinical tests ranging from general physical examinations, chest x-rays, and simple blood tests to detailed imaging studies including brain mri and temporal bone ct scans. no abnormalities were detected in the tests, excluding the possibility that hearing loss in these patients was syndromic. the other siblings  exhibited normal hearing . patients ii- <dig>  ii- <dig>  and ii- <dig> estimated that their hearing loss became severe in their 30’s, during which time they started to wear hearing aids. their hearing loss was further aggravated and became profound in their late forties. ultimately, patients ii- <dig> and ii- <dig> no longer benefited from hearing aids and underwent cochlear implantation. they achieved recognition of common sentences without lip reading one year after implantation. gjb <dig> is one of the most frequently detected genes in individuals with nshl, and thus we first investigated the sequence of gjb <dig> in the nshl patients. after failing to identify any mutations in gjb <dig>  we performed wes on several members of the korean family in order to identify a disease-causing mutation.

copy number analysis using wes data
wes data was obtained from the parents and six siblings . the mean coverage of each sample ranged from  <dig> x to  <dig> x, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the targeted exome had at least  <dig> reads. a multiphasic wes analysis was designed to find a causative nshl mutation . first, we investigated co-segregation of copy number duplication or deletion in exomes of patients using contra software. we detected five cnv loci with distinct features in the plots . none of the cnvs co-segregated with affected or unaffected family members. one cnv locus of the cnvs from three members  was located in 8p <dig> , a region that contains beta-defensin genes and spag <dig> . the following genes were identified as being located at regions of distinct cnvs in the indicated family members: gstm <dig> in 1p <dig>   , ugt2b <dig> in 4q <dig>  , bntl <dig> in 5q <dig>  , and lilrb <dig> in 19q <dig>   . we also applied fisher’s exact test for the lod score per exon to detect co-segregated regions of cnvs, but there were no peaks with values reaching significance. we identified two groups based on the pattern of segregation of spag <dig>  gstm <dig>  and beta-defensin genes to validate the relevance of this method .

exome linkage analysis
because the pedigree strongly suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, we identified  <dig>  coding autosomal snvs from wes data and performed single-point linkage analysis. we identified six hot spots where a number of peaks were closely clustered . specifically, we identified peaks on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> consisting of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> exons, respectively.

we validated single-point linkages using a snp microarray containing  <dig>  snps. along with the eight initial family members recruited for wes analysis, we included three additional subjects  to validate the significance of peaks obtained from exome linkage analysis. the six hot spots detected from sequencing data were also detected in microarray analysis with a relatively high lod score . adding three more subjects to the linkage analysis enhanced the peaks at chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which consisted of one and three snps , respectively. the genotype patterns of these four peaks were perfectly matched with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

snv analysis
based on the wes analysis of four affected and four unaffected family members, we identified  <dig> ~ <dig>  snvs and 413~ <dig> indels. these were reduced to 962~ <dig>  snvs and 140~ <dig> indels after filtering through the dbsnp <dig> and  <dig> genome databases. fifteen variants causing amino acid changes were selected based on their co-segregation pattern within the family . all of the  <dig> variants on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> corresponded to regions with high lod scores . one novel mutation in actin gamma  <dig>  was identified, consisting of a methionine to threonine substitution at amino acid  <dig> , this candidate variant was validated by sanger sequencing and co-segregated with hearing loss in all family members .

actg <dig>  was strictly conserved in  <dig> of  <dig> eukaryotes analyzed , with the m <dig> codon being conserved in  <dig> species. protein damage prediction analysis identified p.m305t as “possibly damaging” by humdiv, “probably damaging” by humvar in polyphen2
 <cit> , and “disease causing” by mutationtaster
 <cit> . the mutation site, met <dig>  was visualized using the 3d structure of bovine beta-actin bound by adenosine triphosphate  with profilin . the methionine was closely located to the atp molecule. additionally, met <dig> is listed as a predicted residue for the atp binding site by the protein data bank .

discussion
wes is a powerful technique that can be used to discover causative genes in human diseases. although wes has been integral in identifying more than  <dig>  novel genes in mendelian disorders
 <cit> , there is still a need for increased efficiency of gene discovery using wes data. in this regard, we analyzed wes data from a family with a history of nshl by focusing on three categories of genetic information: cnvs, linkage analysis, and snvs. utilizing these data, we undertook a stepwise multiphasic approach to identify disease-causing variations in the family.

8p <dig> , which contains a beta-defensin cluster, was detected as a region with high copy number  and low copy number  . the defensin cluster, containing both alpha- and beta-defensins, was previously studied as a dynamic genomic region with varying copy numbers ranging from one to twelve
 <cit> . the parents had normal copy numbers, which was in contrast to the low copy numbers seen in two children and high copy number observed in one child. a total of four haplotypes of 8p <dig>  may have been inherited in this family, and each parent may have had both under- and over-amplified alleles of 8p <dig> . the overall copy number of a parent can appear to be normal due to compensation of copy number from over- to under-amplified alleles
 <cit> . in the family in this study, gstm <dig> and ugt2b <dig>  genes with frequently reported deletions
 <cit> , as well as bntl <dig> and lilrb <dig>  exhibited cnvs. we used fisher’s exact test on the affected and unaffected family members after validating this method for 8p <dig>  and gstm <dig> groups to determine the amplification or deletion of multiple exons that matched the co-segregation pattern of the disease. multiple statistically significant peaks at 8p <dig>  and gstm <dig> were identified, and were identical to plots from the first approach. however, there was only one statistically significant peak identified by testing the two groups that segregated with the disease, and this peak did not correlate with disease status. thus, while wes may provide a method to identify cnv regions with highly similar sequences, determining accurate copy numbers can prove difficult.

linkage analysis was performed to narrow down the number of candidates based on wes data. importantly, linkage analysis with a relatively small number of markers still provides useful information. fewer markers from wes data are available and can be obtained from a snp microarray, and the markers that are identified may not be evenly distributed. given these limitations, it is necessary to consider the potential disadvantages of this approach. because we analyzed only exonic snps , we may have lost critical information located outside of exons. in addition, potential genotyping errors in linkage analyses can reduce statistical power for detecting linkage peaks or result in false positive linkage peaks
 <cit> . even so, the results obtained from the different data sets in this study confirmed the validity of our approach. linkage analysis requires a large number of subjects to help identify putative loci. unless a proper number of subjects are available, an informative result is difficult to obtain.

after applying linkage analysis results, the co-segregated variants were all found to be located in the loci of high lod scores. however, linkage analysis can decrease the number of candidate variants, particularly in instances where candidate variants are widely distributed. additional linkage analysis of wes data demonstrated a similar performance to that of snp microarray data and simultaneously generated results during variant calling. considering that cnvs could be also detected using this approach, the multiphasic analysis of wes data efficiently narrowed and identified candidate variants and was advantageous compared with established methods such as initial acgh, variant calling according to wes data alone, or linkage analysis based on snp microarray data.

actin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein that plays important roles in eukaryotic cell processes such as cell division, migration, endocytosis, and contractility. actin isoforms are classified into two groups based on expression patterns. acta <dig>  acta <dig>  actc, and actg <dig> are “muscle” actins, predominantly expressed in striated or smooth muscle, whereas actb and actg <dig> are cytoplasmic “non-muscle” actins
 <cit> . autosomal dominant progressive sensorineural hearing loss, dfna20/ <dig> , is caused by a mutation in the gamma-actin gene on chromosome  <dig> at q <dig> . some actg <dig> mutations are associated with baraitser-winter syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delay, facial dysmorphologies, brain malformations, colobomas, and variable hearing loss. the constellation of these abnormalities is suggested as the most severe phenotype of actg <dig> mutations
 <cit> . a genome-wide screen of dfna <dig> localized candidates to 17q <dig> 
 <cit>  and mapped the causative missense mutations to highly conserved actin domains of the gamma-actin gene 
 <cit> . in vivo and in vitro studies of actg <dig> indicate that it is required for reinforcement and long-term stability of actin filamentous structures of stereocilia, but not for auditory hair cell development, which is in line with the progressive nature of hearing loss related to actg <dig> mutations in humans
 <cit> . further, missense mutations in either actb or actg <dig> have recently been reported to cause baraitser-winter syndrome. interestingly, of the  <dig> mutations that cause dfna20
 <cit>  and  <dig> mutations that cause baraitser-winter syndrome  that have been reported, are all missense mutations. the predicted interaction between met <dig> and atp in bovine beta-actin, a protein with a 99% identity to actg <dig>  implies that the mutation of met <dig> may influence atp binding of actg <dig>  which is essential for polymerization of g-actin to f-actin.

actg <dig> is predominantly expressed in intestinal epithelial and auditory hair cells
 <cit> . detection of exclusively missense mutations in this gene may imply that truncating mutations have more severe effects and might cause embryonic lethality. the hearing impaired subjects in this study  did not report any gastrointestinal complaints. the subjects in this study required cochlear implants, recapitulating what has previously been reported regarding the management of patients with mutations in actg <dig> and resultant nshl
 <cit> . the severe phenotype and rapid progression of hearing loss to a profound level within one or two decades associated with mutations in actg <dig> necessitates an early molecular genetic diagnosis and timely auditory rehabilitation.

CONCLUSIONS
two or more platforms  have previously been required to generate complex genetic information such as cnvs, linkages, snvs, and indels. in general studies of mendelian disorders, wes has primarily been utilized to obtain only snvs and indels. our study agrees well with other work demonstrating that analysis of wes data also allows for cnv and linkage determination due to its quantitative traits. given the robust nature of wes data, it is clear that the full capabilities of this relatively new technology have not yet been fully realized. our multiphasic wes analysis proved very powerful for the interpretation and narrowing of wes results, in particular when a large amount of family data is available.
