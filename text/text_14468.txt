BACKGROUND
during their life cycle, flowering plants undergo three developmental phases, the juvenile and adult vegetative stages and a reproductive phase. during the last decade it has become clear that micrornas  are important regulators of transitions between these phases. mirnas are small regulatory rna molecules which trigger the post-transcriptional repression of target genes through a base-pairing mechanism
 <cit> . there are some  <dig> mirna families that are highly conserved in flowering plants. many of these conserved mirna families control crucial developmental processes through the down-regulation of conserved transcription factor-encoding genes.

the mirnas with the best-defined roles in regulating phase changes in the shoot meristem are mir <dig> and mir <dig> which form a regulatory module that is widely conserved in plants. in arabidopsis, rice and maize, mir <dig> regulates shoot branching, leaf initiation and juvenile-to-adult phase transition through the down-regulation of several spl genes
 <cit> . in grass plants, over-expression of mir <dig> promotes vegetative branching producing an increased number of tillers but inhibits inflorescence branching resulting in a reduced number of spikelets
 <cit> . detailed analysis of mir <dig> function in the maize inflorescence has shown that it has a role in establishing axillary meristem boundaries by spatially restricting expression of the spl gene tasselsheath <dig>  to the bract. this leads to the allocation of more cells to the outgrowth of spikelet meristems at the expense of leaf initiation
 <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated cross talk between the mir <dig> and mir <dig> pathways, which appear to have conserved roles in coordinating the timing of vegetative phase changes and competency to flower in all angiosperms
 <cit> . during vegetative shoot development in arabidopsis and maize, mir <dig> expression gradually decreases and is inversely correlated with that of mir172
 <cit> . over-expression of mir <dig> leads to a decrease in mir <dig> abundance in young shoots
 <cit> . in arabidopsis mir <dig> down-regulates atspl9/ <dig> which in turn directly activates the transcription of mir172b <cit> . the atspl3/4/ <dig> genes are regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally by mir172
 <cit>  and mir <dig> 
 <cit> , respectively. in maize, mir <dig> is thought to repress the maintenance of juvenile traits and promote the onset of reproductive development by down-regulating glossy <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> expression reaches a maximum in reproductive shoots and promotes floral initiation and flower development by repressing expression of ap2-like  genes
 <cit> . in maize and barley, loss of mir <dig> function promotes the formation of ectopic undifferentiated branches in the place of spikelet meristems  which in barley eventually lead to the formation of a nascent spike
 <cit> . in barley mir <dig> has also been shown to be responsible for the cleistogamy phenotype by repressing an ap2-like gene, cleistogamy <dig> , in the lodicules, preventing the outgrowth and opening of the floret
 <cit> .

mir <dig> is a well conserved mirna family known to regulate members of the scarecrow-like  transcription factor family. the scls belong to a subclass of the highly conserved gras family composed of homologs of gai, rga and scr
 <cit> . among other functions, gras proteins are known to be involved in ga responses controlling flowering and regulating apical meristem development
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, there are three mir <dig> genes  which are predicted to regulate three scl <dig> genes  and lost meristems ,
 <cit> . the expression domains of the mir <dig> family members and the scl6-ii/iii mrnas overlap, suggesting a redundant function for both mirna and target mrnas
 <cit> . mir171a is most highly expressed in the inflorescence where it regulates scl6-iii and scl6-iv expression through mrna cleavage
 <cit> . arabidopsis plants over-expressing mir171c  and the triple scl <dig> mutant show similar pleiotropic phenotypes, including altered shoot branching, plant height, chlorophyll accumulation, primary root elongation, flower structure, leaf shape and patterning, indicating that mir <dig> acts mainly by down-regulating scl <dig> genes to control a wide range of developmental processes during shoot development
 <cit> . the reduced branching phenotype observed in oe171c plants can be rescued by the expression of a mir171c-resistant version of scl6-ii, iii, or iv <cit> , suggesting that the three targets have partially redundant function. scl6-iv, which is expressed at the boundary between the axillary meristem and the sam, seems to have a different function to the two other scl <dig> genes, being linked to branching but not sam maintenance
 <cit> . a more detailed analysis of scl6-ii/iii showed that these genes are expressed in the peripheral zone and vascular tissues of the sam and promote the maintenance of the pool of meristematic cells and the differentiation of the axillary meristem
 <cit> .

although studies in arabidopsis have revealed important roles for mir <dig> and its scl targets, their roles in monocot plants are unknown. this study investigated the role of the mir171-scl module in controlling plant architecture in barley . over-expression of mir <dig> affects expression of meristem identity genes suggesting a conservation of the role identified in arabidopsis. in addition a delay in the transition to reproductive growth involving mir <dig> was observed which suggests that there are monocot specific functions for mir <dig> and its target genes.

RESULTS
conserved molecular functions of mir <dig> in barley
in barley two mature mir <dig> sequences  have been identified
 <cit>  which differ by one central nucleotide. the only mirna precursor identified is that for hvu-mir171a . there are nine rice, fourteen maize and four brachypodium mir <dig> family members in mirbase, indicating that barley is likely to have additional mir <dig> genes.

the abundance of mir <dig> was examined in various tissues and it was found to be predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues . these data correlate with previous observations in arabidopsis where mir <dig> mostly accumulates in reproductive organs
 <cit> . the psrnatarget server  was used to search for potential targets of hvu-mir171a and b amongst a recently assembled full-length cdna dataset from barley
 <cit> . this analysis identified  <dig> potential target ests predicted to be mir171-regulated by cleavage or translational repression using a mismatch score of  <dig>  or less . of the target mrnas with the lowest mismatch scores , three  encode scl6-like proteins and are all predicted to be regulated by mir <dig> cleavage. the fourth potential mir <dig> target  encodes a protein of unknown function and is predicted to be regulated by translational repression. we searched degradome data generated from developing barley seed
 <cit>  for evidence of cleavage of these four mrnas and found evidence for cleavage of the three scl6-like mrnas but not ak <dig> . the degradome data for ak <dig> had the greatest number of reads 2 bp upstream of the predicted cleavage site however rlm-5′ race showed that the predicted mir <dig> cleavage site was the most abundant .

mis-expression of mir <dig> in barley leads to pleiotropic phenotypes
to study the role of mir <dig> and its targets in barley, pri-mir171a was over-expressed under control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. seven independent transgenic lines were obtained with at least one hundred fold over-expression of pri-mir171a compared to wild-type . a corresponding increase in the abundance of mature mir <dig> was also detected in all the transgenic lines . the to mir <dig> over-expressing plants  showed a pleiotropic phenotype with altered shoot architecture and delayed flowering. for lines where we were able to obtain seed, these phenotypes were confirmed in the t <dig> generation. in our subsequent analyses, t <dig> lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were used; these had similar phenotypes and expression of the mature mir <dig>  t <dig> oe <dig> plants were selected based on the presence of the transgene and grown under long day  and short day  conditions with  <dig> and 10 hour photoperiods, respectively.

under ld conditions the first wild-type  stems stopped producing leaves and started to elongate at  <dig> dpg  whereas oe <dig> plants at the same age continued to produce new leaves, indicating a juvenile-to-adult transition delay. the internodes of oe <dig> plants started to extend after  <dig> dpg, while wt plants were already flowering . oe <dig> plants were extremely late flowering with the first spike starting to flower after  <dig> dpg . at this stage the stems were fully elongated and oe <dig> plants were dwarfed compared to wt at the same stage of development . the dwarfism was due to reduced internode length, resulting in a compaction of the leaves wrapped around the inflorescence . oe <dig> produced on average one or two additional visible nodes, with a decreasing internode length towards the top of the stem . the transgenic plants eventually developed short and partially sterile spikes . a similar phenotype was observed under sd conditions where oe <dig> showed an increased number of phytomers, reduced internode length  and a delay in the juvenile-to-adult transition compared to the wt grown under the same conditions . in addition, oe <dig> plants grown under sd produced fewer tillers  than the wt plants  and never developed any fertile spikes.

a closer examination of the shoot apex of oe <dig> plants grown under ld showed an accumulation of phytomers with a progressive reduction of bending at the internode. these eventually form a compact structure of joined nodes with a series of leaves that wrap around the inflorescence . the main inflorescences, as well as the resulting spikes , were shorter with a reduced number of spikelet meristems compared to the wild-type . the development of the spikelet meristems into floral organs was delayed, but their morphology and phyllotaxy on the inflorescence meristem appeared normal . at the base of each oe <dig> inflorescence one to at least four indeterminate meristems which formed new inflorescence meristems were observed . these ectopic inflorescence meristems were sometimes preceded by the formation of short aerial tillers producing additional leaves in a condensed structure at the top of the culm . the formation of a new branch appeared to be at the expense of the adjoining inflorescences which stopped developing and dried out . at the base of the wt spike at flowering stage, the floral structure on the first rachilla phytomer was restricted to a bract  and a pair of glumes . in comparison, oe <dig> spikes at the same developmental stage possess several phytomers with intermediate culm/rachis characteristics at the base of the inflorescence . internode lengths were intermediate between those of culm and rachis phytomers and indeterminate inflorescence meristems emerged from the axillary buds instead of spikelet meristems . these secondary inflorescence meristems eventually produced lemma-awn structures but never grew and formed a fully developed floret . meanwhile, the main inflorescence produced several wt-like florets in the middle of the spike but only a few were fertile . oe <dig> anthers were smaller and translucent in comparison to the wt, suggesting a pollen development defect that could explain the partial sterility phenotype . in addition, the terminal branch structure of the spike sometimes gave rise to an ectopic inflorescence meristem . in the strongest lines, the developmental delay was such that the spike did not form any floral organs and dried out . the oe171-3 t <dig> plant had the highest mir <dig> expression and never flowered. it developed tillers with an extremely disorganized inflorescence with a phyllotaxy defect of the spikelet meristems which never transitioned to floral meristems . under sd conditions wt plants sometimes developed one ectopic inflorescence meristem at the base of the primary inflorescence which eventually formed a fertile lateral spike . in comparison, the inflorescences of oe <dig> plants developed several ectopic inflorescence meristems, as observed in long day conditions , but the developmental delay was stronger and the spikes dried out before reaching the flowering stage .

these observations suggest that barley mir <dig> can regulate axillary meristem development and the timing of the juvenile to adult phase transtition. in arabidopsis, mir <dig> acts mainly through the down-regulation of the scl6-ii/iii/iv genes; over-expression of mir <dig> or loss of scl <dig> function represses axillary meristem differentiation resulting in reduced shoot branching
 <cit> , and eventually a complete developmental arrest under sd conditions
 <cit> . this phenotype correlates with the observations here and suggests that mir <dig> regulates shoot branching through a conserved mechanism between monocots and dicots. however, in contrast to the oe <dig> phenotype in barley, oe <dig> in arabidopsis also promotes stem elongation
 <cit> , represses leaf initiation
 <cit>  and only slightly delays flowering
 <cit> , suggesting that the roles of mir <dig> and its targets evolved differently for these processes in barley and arabidopsis.

mis-regulation of gene expression in oe <dig> barley plants
in both barley and arabidopsis, oe <dig> affects shoot branching
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, the mir <dig> family acts mainly through the down-regulation of three scl <dig> genes  <cit> . as oe <dig> disrupts meristem function we extracted rna from young inflorescence meristem tissues of t <dig> oe <dig> transgenic lines and wt plants grown under short day conditions to quantify the abundance of mir <dig> and its targets. all transgenic lines showed an over-accumulation of the pri-mir171a transcripts and mature mir <dig> sequences . we were unable to detect ak <dig>  ak <dig> and ak <dig> in meristem tissues by rt-qpcr . ak <dig> was expressed in wildtype and showed reduced levels in oe <dig> plants  suggesting that this was the main target down-regulated by mir <dig> over-expression in the shoot apex. however it is possible that other target genes with higher mismatch scores are affected in oe <dig> plants and that the other scl <dig> genes are targeted by mir <dig> outside of the meristem tissues that we have focused on. for simplicity we refer to ak <dig> as hvscl from here onwards.

we determined the tissue specificity of hvscl expression by rt-qpcr . hvscl is expressed in the shoot, basal node, green spike and ovary. the strong expression of hvscl in green spike and ovary overlaps with the highest mir <dig> abundance, at least at the tissue level, suggesting that mir <dig> acts to dampen hvscl expression rather than restrict it
 <cit> . these data correlate with previous observations in arabidopsis where both mir <dig> and scl target mrnas are predominantly detected in the same tissues
 <cit> .

rna in situ hybridization of arabidopsis shoot meristem tissues shows that scl6-ii/iii are mostly expressed in the peripheral zone and the vascular strands of developing axillary buds where they promote cell differentiation and help maintain the polar organization of the sam
 <cit> . the maintenance of the sam requires the expression of wuschel  and the knotted-like gene shoot meristemless  to prevent the differentiation of the meristematic cells located in the central zone. in the double mutant scl6-ii scl6-iii grown under short day conditions, the spatial expression patterns of wus and stm are altered
 <cit> . a wus-related homeobox gene, hvwus , and a class i knotted-like gene, hvkn <dig>  were identified in barley est databases. quantification of their relative expression in the inflorescences of oe <dig> plants shows a reduction for both genes compared to the wt . this effect may reflect a disorganization of the sam and loss of maintenance of meristem cells, which correlates with mir <dig> function in arabidopsis and could explain the reduction of shoot branching observed in barley oe <dig> 

the oe <dig> phenotype resembles that of oe <dig> in maize
 <cit> . in maize, mir <dig> controls plant architecture by regulating at least  <dig> spl genes, teosinte glume architecture <dig>  and tasselsheath <dig>  <cit> . the dominant corngrass <dig>  mutant, in which zma-mir156b/c is over-expressed, shows an extended vegetative program characterized by an increased number of leaves and the development of large bract leaves in the inflorescences
 <cit> . over-expression of zma-mir156b/c also causes the reduction of zma-mir <dig> abundance which is known to control juvenile-to-adult phase transition through the down-regulation of glossy <dig>  <cit>  and spikelet meristem determinancy through the repression of ids <dig> and sid <dig> <cit> . in barley, the phenotype associated with loss of mir <dig> function is similar to the oe <dig> plants, blocking spikelet meristem determinacy and exhibiting ectopic branch structures from the base and the end of the spike
 <cit>  . these phenotypic similarities suggest that mir <dig> is linked to the mir156-mir <dig> pathway in barley.

the effect of oe <dig> on mir <dig> and mir <dig> expression was examined using inflorescence tissue from t <dig> oe <dig> and wt plants grown under ld conditions . mir <dig> abundance was higher in oe <dig> lines but no change in mir <dig> expression was detected. using the same tissues, we quantified the relative abundance of two barley mrnas, coding for an spl gene predicted to be targeted by mir <dig>  hvspl  and a potential target of mir <dig>  hvap2l  . as expected, hvspl was down-regulated in oe <dig>  reinforcing the hypothesis that mir <dig> acts at least partially through the up-regulation of mir <dig>  surprisingly, hvap2l was up-regulated in oe <dig>  suggesting that mir <dig> regulates hvap2l expression independently from mir <dig>  this last observation correlates with previous work in arabidopsis reporting that toe <dig>  expression gradually increases along with mir <dig> abundance in the developing shoot
 <cit> . additionally, ap <dig> was recently shown to directly activate mir156e expression in arabidopsis
 <cit> , suggesting that the up-regulation of hvap2l in oe <dig> could be responsible for the increasing abundance of mir <dig> 

the increased accumulation of mir <dig> in oe <dig> did not cause a reduction of mir <dig> abundance in contrast with previous observations in arabidopsis and maize
 <cit> . however, observations by jung et al.
 <cit>  showed that oe <dig> driven by an inducible promoter in arabidopsis did not noticeably affect mir <dig> abundance. the authors proposed that mir <dig> principally affects mir <dig> during the early vegetative stage by repressing mir172b expression and that the increasing mir <dig> abundance during the late vegetative stage is driven by other mir <dig> genes independent of mir <dig>  this correlates with the observation that mir <dig> abundance continues to increase during later vegetative stages while the mir <dig> level stays at a constant minimum level
 <cit> . in agreement with this hypothesis, a decrease in mir <dig> expression was detected in the young leaves of oe <dig> t <dig> plants which over-accumulated mir <dig> . maize oe <dig> plants did not show the same flowering defect as for loss of mir <dig> function
 <cit> , suggesting that the function of mir <dig> in the inflorescence is independent of mir <dig> 

the phenotype of the barley oe <dig> plants was also reminiscent of mutants in maize, rice and barley genes that affect the rate of leaf initiation. we did not observe any clear changes in the leaf initiation rate in oe <dig>  but similarities in other phenotypes led us to examine these genes in oe <dig> plants. in arabidopsis the leaf initiation rate is likely to be controlled by two independent pathways, one involving mir156-spls and the other involving two orthologs of the rice plastochron <dig>  gene which encode cytochrome p <dig> enzymes
 <cit> . in rice, loss of pla <dig> function causes an extension of the vegetative program characterized by an increased number of short vegetative phytomers and the production of vegetative shoots  instead of primary rachis branches
 <cit> , a phenotype that closely resembles oe <dig> in barley. more recently it has been shown that pla <dig> expression is under control of the transcription factor neck leaf  <dig> , which when mutated causes a similar phenotype to that of the pla <dig> mutant
 <cit> . nl <dig> is orthologous to third outer glume  in barley and tasselsheath- <dig>  in maize. in both trd and tsh- <dig> mutants the repression of bract growth is suppressed, producing leaves that sheath the inflorescence and a reduction in the number of inflorescence branches
 <cit> . therefore the regulation of trd and pla <dig> by mir <dig> in barley was investigated. trd was previously cloned using degenerate pcr . the mrna abundance for both genes was significantly reduced in the inflorescences of oe <dig> compared to the wt . these results suggest that mir <dig> coordinates vegetative phase changes in barley through the regulation of two potentially distinct pathways. it is proposed that mir <dig> acts up-stream of mir <dig> and trd which in turn may regulate hvpla <dig> expression as was observed for their orthologs in rice
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the data presented here suggest roles for mir <dig> and its targets in regulating shoot development in barley. over-expression of mir <dig> results in an extended vegetative phase characterised by an increased number of leaves and the initiation of indeterminate axillary meristems instead of spikelet meristems. additionally, oe <dig> plants have a reduced number of tillers emerging from the axillary meristems of the crown  and a delay in the differentiation of spikelet meristems into floral organs. a model is proposed in which mir <dig> is an upstream regulator that coordinates the timing of shoot development in barley through three independent pathways. first, the results, together with current knowledge from arabidopsis, suggest that mir <dig> affects meristem maintenance and axillary meristem differentiation in barley through the down-regulation of hvscl <cit> , and consequently affects the expression of meristem specific genes such as the homologs of wus and kn <dig> analysed in this study. secondly, mir <dig> could repress vegetative phase transitions in barley through the upregulation of mir <dig>  a known regulator of the transition from juvenile to adult phases across the angiosperms
 <cit> . interestingly, oe <dig> and oe <dig> in arabidopsis show opposite effects on leaf initiation
 <cit> , suggesting that the possible connection between the mir <dig> and mir <dig> pathways may be monocotyledon specific. thirdly, mir <dig> promotes vegetative traits in barley through a secondary pathway, independent from mir156
 <cit> , that involves trd and hvpla <dig> <cit> . these apparent additional roles for mir <dig> and its targets in barley shoot development may represent an important evolutionary difference between monocot and dicot plants.
