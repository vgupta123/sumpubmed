BACKGROUND
major histocompatibility complex class ii  proteins are normally found in b lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages; they are primarily involved in processing foreign, extracellular antigens, which are endocytozed and then enclosed in endosomes containing acid proteases. the ph in endosomes ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig>  
 <cit> . in endosomes, antigens are degraded into oligopeptides. mhc class ii proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum  and bind to a protein known as the mhc class ii-associated invariant chain . ii facilitates the export from the er of mhc class ii proteins and prevents binding to peptides resident in the er. the complex mhc-ii enters a specific endocytic compartment, called miic , which fuses with endosomes. ii is cleaved initially to the so-called clip fragment, with clip later being displaced by high-affinity peptides. the peptide – mhc class ii protein complex is translocated to the cell surface, where it is recognized by cd4+ t cells.

peptides binding to mhc class ii vary in length from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, yet the binding site accepts only nine peptide residues, the rest extending from both ends as the cleft is open-ended. the side chains of bound peptides project into several binding pockets while a system of hydrogen bonds forms between the peptide backbone and the side chain atoms of the mhc 
 <cit> .

human mhcs, known as hla , are extremely polymorphic and polygenic. the imgt/hla database lists over  <dig>  hla class ii proteins 
 <cit> . hlas class ii contain three loci: dr, dq and dp. dr and dq proteins are well studied, while dp was initially considered of lesser importance in immune responses. however, it is now clear that hla-dp proteins have important roles in mediating the immune response to many diseases, such as graft-versus-host  disease 
 <cit> , sarcoidosis 
 <cit> , juvenile chronic arthritis 
 <cit> , graves’ disease 
 <cit> , hard metal lung disease 
 <cit>  and especially, chronic beryllium disease 
 <cit> . recently, the x-ray structure of the hla-dp <dig>  in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr α-chain has been determined 
 <cit> . although the overall structure of dp <dig> is similar to that of other mhc class ii proteins, it contains a unique solvent-exposed acidic pocket containing three glutamic acids . this pocket may be able to bind beryllium and present it to t cells, providing a mechanistic explanation that underlies chronic beryllium disease 
 <cit> . x-ray data also reveals that the dp <dig> binding site comprises four binding pockets: deep, hydrophobic pockets p <dig> and p6; large, shallow, negatively charged p4; and deep, narrow and polar pocket p <dig> 

peptides bind to mhc class ii proteins in an acidic environment . bell-shaped profiles with optima at ph  <dig>  are observed in many peptide – mhc class ii binding experiments 
 <cit> . acidic ph markedly elevated association rate constants  <dig> fold; dissociation rates are, by contrast, almost unchanged in the ph range  <dig>  –  <dig>  
 <cit> . the equilibrium binding level is thus enhanced at ph  <dig> . the influence of ph on the binding equilibrium can be explained by subtle conformational changes due to altered protonation and deprotonation states and near neighbor interactions. the only amino acid sensitive to ph in the range  <dig>  –  <dig>  is histidine. the side-chain pka of the his imidazole is  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  imidazole is protonated and his is thus positively charged and very hydrophilic. at ph  <dig> , imidazole is unprotonated making his less hydrophilic. thus, a pair of amino acids consisting of his and a hydrophobic residue could function as a ph-sensitive “his button” 
 <cit> . it “closes” at ph  <dig>   and “opens” at ph  <dig>  . such ph-sensitive switch was observed for his33α in the formation of hla-dr <dig> – hla-dm complexes 
 <cit> .

there are five his residues in the hla-dp binding cleft: four belong to the α-chain  and one to the β-chain . all five histidine residues are conserved among dp proteins. his79β side chain contacts the binding peptide in the vicinity of peptide position  <dig>  recently, a favorable π-π stacking between the aromatic rings of his79β and his2peptide was identified 
 <cit> . the other his residues are remote from the binding site and do not make contact with the bound peptide.

molecular docking is a key structure-based method with significant utility in drug design, bioinformatics, and immunoinformatics. in contrast to sequence-based approaches, virtual docking experiments do not require extensive pre-existing experimental data. the only information necessary is a reliable model of the peptide – mhc protein complex, as provided by x-ray crystallography. docking methodology allows the development of predictive models where the training and test data are fully independent, thus, eliminating any possibility of over-fitting. we use rigid docking to identify optimised bound peptide conformations; since even for a nonamer, a fully unconstrained peptide docking would be of a prohibitively extended duration. however, since the number of distinct peptide conformations observed within currently-known x-ray structures remains very small, we make the parsimonious and wholly-reasonable assumption that peptides will bind in a similar conformation. molecular docking has been extensively and rigorously tested on both peptide-mhc class i and peptide-mhc class ii complexes. as an approach to evaluating peptide binding to mhcs, it has proved to be rapid, accurate, and reliable 
 <cit> .

recently, we applied a molecular docking protocol to a library of modeled peptide-dp <dig> complexes to assess the contribution of each of the  <dig> naturally occurred amino acids at each of the nine binding core positions and four flanking residues  
 <cit> . the normalized binding scores formed a quantitative matrix , known also as a position-specific scoring matrix . pssms are a commonly used representation of motifs or patterns within biological sequences. the predictive ability of the derived qm was assessed using an external test set of known binders to dp <dig>  a comparison to predictions made by existing servers for dp <dig> binding prediction indicated an improvement in performance offered by our docking score-based qm  
 <cit> .

in the present study, we modelled by homology four of the most frequent hla-dp proteins 
 <cit> : dp <dig> , dp <dig> , dp <dig>  and dp <dig> . we applied a similar docking protocol to derive ds-qms for peptide binding prediction 
 <cit> . to investigate the influence of ph on the predictive ability, different qms were derived at two ph values:  <dig>  and  <dig> . the qms were validated using external test sets and compared to other servers for dp binding prediction. additionally, in order to analyze the peptide-mhc protein interaction interface, a single docking of hla-dp <dig>  in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr α-chain  was analyzed using rosetta dock 
 <cit> . our analysis affords a deep and detailed analysis of the different amino acid preferences at each position of peptides binding dp proteins.

methods
input data
the x-ray structure of the hla-dp <dig>  protein, in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr α-chain, was used as the starting structure for homology modelling 
 <cit> . the covalently bound peptide was separated and defined as chain c. it consists of nine binding core positions  and six flanking residues . the conformation of the protein was used to model by homology the four hla-dp proteins. the conformation of the bound peptide was used as a template for the modelling of four virtual combinatorial peptide libraries.

homology modelling
models of four hla-dp proteins were built using the x-ray structure of hla-dp <dig> protein  as the template for homology modelling. hla-dp proteins used were: dp <dig> , dp <dig> , dp <dig> , and dp <dig> . the polymorphic amino acids among the first  <dig> amino acids from chain α  and the first  <dig> amino acids from chain β  were mutated accordingly. the resulting structure, in complex with the native peptide from the starting x-ray structure, was subjected to energy minimization by simulated annealing using the amber force field 
 <cit> . each peptide-dp protein complex was used as a starting structure for generating the corresponding virtual peptide library.

combinatorial peptide library
the nine positions forming the peptide binding core were examined. four peptide libraries, each consisted of  <dig> peptides , were built using pymol 
 <cit> . the saas  approach was used to model the conformations of each altered side chains: after substitution, the peptide was minimized while keeping the mhc protein rigid. the protonation state of ionisable protein side chains was assigned to a standard ionisable state: neutral for his; positively charged for arg and lys; and negatively charged for asp and glu 
 <cit> . in the case of docking at ph  <dig>  his was considered to be positively charged.

autodock protocol
a parallelized version of autodock  <dig>  
 <cit> , employing an implementation of the lamarckian genetic algorithm , was used to model the peptide binding to hla-dps. all simulations were run on the ibm blue gene – p of the bulgarian supercomputing centre. the input ligands for autodock  <dig>  were prepared by using tools developed in-house using c# and .net. the output data were mined by python scripts using the mgl tools  <dig> . <dig> package 
 <cit> . all retained poses considered in the study had an rmsd below  <dig>  Å. to limit the computational burden of calculating peptide–mhc interactions at positions not involved in the static docking, all coordinates were kept fixed apart from the peptide residues of interest. these were left flexible. all ga settings were kept to their default values, apart from the number of energy evaluations and the number of generations which were set to  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  respectively. the docking grid was defined as a cuboid with respective dimensions of: 68 Å × 80 Å × 80 Å for dp <dig>  72 Å × 80 Å × 82 Å for dp <dig>  72 Å × 80 Å × 82 Å for dp <dig> and 72 Å × 80 Å × 82 Å for dp <dig> which encompassed the entire peptide binding site on dp. the output from ten independent ga runs for each ligand was processed and the pose  with the lowest free energy of binding  was considered. feb values represent the direct output from the autodock  <dig>  scoring function which takes into consideration weighted terms for van der waals dispersion/repulsion, hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, desolvation interactions, and the change in torsional free energy when the ligand goes from an unbound to a bound state.

docking score-based quantitative matrices 
the febs derived from the docking experiments had negative and positive values. negative febs correspond to binding peptides, while positive febs correspond to non-binding peptides. only negative febs were considered; non-binding amino acids were assigned the penalty score of − <dig>  the febs were normalized position per position using the following formula:

  febi,norm=febi−feb¯febmax−febmin, 

where febi is the binding energy of the i-th peptide, 
feb¯ is the average for a given position, febmax and febmin are the maximum and minimum febs for a given position. normalized febs were multiplied by  before being entered into the quantitative matrices  for ease of presentation. thus, the positive febs correspond to preferred amino acids, and negative febs to non-preferred residues. eight qms were derived: two for each hla-dp protein at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , respectively.

test set
four test sets of peptides known to bind hla-dp <dig>  hla-dp <dig>  hla-dp <dig>  and hla-dp <dig>  respectively, were collected from the immune epitope database 
 <cit>  . the test set of dp <dig> binders contained  <dig> peptides originating from  <dig> proteins. the dp <dig> test set contained  <dig> binding peptides from  <dig> proteins. the dp <dig> test set contained  <dig> binding peptides from  <dig> proteins. the dp <dig> test set contained  <dig> binding peptides from  <dig> proteins. the peptides had different lengths. no multiple binders were used. each protein was represented as a set of overlapping nonamers. the nonameric subsequence of any known binder with the highest score was considered a binder; all other protein nonamers were considered as non-binders. the binding score of each nonamer was calculated as a sum of the weights of all nine positions or of different combinations thereof.

the tests were performed under conditions similar to those which an experimental immunologist might use: proteins were cleaved into overlapping nonamers, the binding score of each nonamer was predicted. nonamers were then ranked according to their binding score and the top 5% of the predicted nonamers was selected. the selected peptides were then compared to the known binders. if the nonamer sequence was part of the known binder sequence, the predicted peptide was considered as a true predicted binder. the ratio of all true predicted binders to all binders in the corresponding test set defined the sensitivity of prediction at the top 5% cut-off. the test sets used in the present study are given as additional file 
 <dig> 

additionally, the models were compared in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve . two variables - sensitivity and 1-specificity - were calculated at different thresholds. auc is a quantitative measure of predictive ability and varies from  <dig>  for random prediction to  <dig>  for a perfect prediction.

rosetta dock protocol
the rosetta dock server  was used to generate the pair interaction energies across the peptide-dp <dig> protein binding interface. the x-ray structure of the peptide-hla-dp <dig>  complex  was used as input. the rosettadock output file contains a table of pair energies across the binding interface. several energy terms are generated: etot is the sum of all energies between the pair residues; eatr and erep are the lennard – jones attractive and repulsive energies, respectively; esol is the solvation energy according to the lazaridis–karplus solvation model 
 <cit> , which penalizes buried polar groups; ehbnd is the hydrogen bonding energy per residue; epair is a statistically-based pair term derived from the pdb database, which favours salt bridges.

RESULTS
pair energies across peptide – hla-dp <dig> protein binding interface
the peptide-dp protein binding interface was analysed using the rosettadock server 
 <cit> .

it consists of  <dig> residues:  <dig> residues belong to α-chain  and  <dig> residues are from β-chain  
 <cit>  . only five of the residues are polymorphic among the five most frequent dp proteins . these are tyr/phe9β, ala/asp/glu55β, lys/glu69β, val/met76β and asp/gly84β. asp55β is involved in a salt-bridge with peptide ser <dig>  while the other polymorphic residues do not form either an h-bond or a salt bridge with the bound peptide.

docking score-based quantitative matrices  for dp <dig>  dp <dig>  dp <dig> and dp5
four libraries, each consisting of  <dig> peptides , were built. each peptide was docked separately into the corresponding dp rigid binding site. ds-qms were derived based on normalized feb scores, as described in data and methods. dockings were performed at two ph values:  <dig>  and  <dig> . over this ph range, only his undergoes protonation/ deprotonation. at ph  <dig> , his is protonated and very hydrophilic, yet at ph  <dig>  his is neutral and less hydrophilic. the eight ds-qms  derived here are given in additional file 
 <dig> 

external validation
a test set comprising  <dig> peptides known to bind hla-dp <dig>  hla-dp <dig>  hla-dp <dig> or hla-dp <dig>  originating from  <dig> proteins, was used for external validation of the derived ds-qms. initially, the sensitivity of the top 5% of the best scored peptides for each position was assessed using ds-qms calculated at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> . next, all possible combinations of different positions were evaluated. the most predictive models among all possible combinations between the nine peptide positions are shown in table 
 <dig>  it is evident that almost all positions are involved in these highly predictive models, indicating that no peptide positions have a negligible effect on binding. the results also indicate that the models derived at ph  <dig>  seem to predict better than those derived at ph  <dig> . moreover, different peptide positions are important for binding at different ph values.

comparison to existing servers for hla-dp binding prediction
the best performing models derived here were compared to two state-of-the-art servers for mhc class ii binding prediction: netmhcii 
 <cit>  and iedb 
 <cit> . both use sequence-based models powered by artificial neural networks . netmhcii identifies nonamers, while iedb works only with 15mers. the tests were performed as follows: protein sequences were converted into sets of overlapping peptides , and the binding score of each peptide was predicted; peptides were ranked according to their binding score, and the top 5% of the ranked peptides were selected and compared to known binders. if the predicted peptide was included in the known binder sequence, it was considered a true predicted binder. the ratio of all true predicted binders to all binders in the corresponding test set defined the sensitivity of prediction at the top 5% cut-off. the sensitivities were recorded and compared to our best predicted models at ph  <dig>  . additionally, servers were compared in terms of auc . it is evident that our ds-qm models out-performed state-of-the-art servers for dp <dig>  dp <dig> and dp <dig> proteins.

effect of ph on peptide and protein his residues
as peptides typically bind to class ii mhc proteins in an acidic environment, with a ph between  <dig>  and  <dig> , dockings were performed at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , and compared in terms of their predictive ability. better prediction was found for the ds-qms derived at ph  <dig> . the only amino acid sensitive to ph in the range  <dig>  to  <dig>  is histidine. the pka of the his imidazole is  <dig> , thus making his protonated and very hydrophilic at ph  <dig>  and unprotonated and less hydrophilic at ph  <dig> . the influence of ph on the affinity of peptide binding to hla-dp proteins has two potential aspects: influence on peptide protonation/deprotonation and influence on protein binding site protonation/deprotonation. figure 
 <dig> summarizes the normalized feb values for protonated and nonprotonated his residues at each of the nine peptide binding core positions. it is clear that protonated his residues are preferred in most peptide positions . as the peptide binding site on dp proteins is predominantly negatively charged 
 <cit> , preference for positively charged his were expected.

five his residues are present in the hla-dp binding site: four belong to the α-chain  and one belongs to the β-chain . all are conserved among the studied dps. only his79β contacts the binding peptide in the vicinity of peptide position 2; the other his residues are distant from the binding site. the protonation of his79β allows an additional h-bond to be formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to peptide position − <dig>  and the imidazole ε-nitrogen of his79β . the estimated n-h…o = c bond energy for polypeptides in water environment lies within the range:  <dig>  – 2 kcal/mol 
 <cit> . this means that the formation of this additional h-bond can increase the binding affinity constant of the peptide-protein complex by over an order of magnitude in the absence of other effects. this may explain the enhanced experimentally-observed equilibrium binding level seen at ph  <dig>  
 <cit> .

discussion
in the present study, molecular docking procedures developed recently for peptide binding prediction to hla-dp <dig> protein 
 <cit>  were significantly extended to include the four most frequent dp proteins 
 <cit> : dp <dig> , dp <dig> , dp <dig>  and dp <dig> . the x-ray structure of the peptide – hla-dp <dig> protein complex was used as a starting template to model by homology the structure of the four dp proteins. in turn, these were used to generate combinatorial peptide libraries built using the saas principle. peptides were docked into the dp binding site using autodock at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> . the resulting scores were recorded, normalized, and used to generate ds-qms. the predictive ability of these qms was tested using an external test set and compared to existing servers for dp binding prediction. the models derived at ph  <dig>  predict better than those derived at ph  <dig> , showing significantly improved predictions for three of the four dp proteins, when compared to current state-of-the-art servers. ds-qms can recognize 50% of the known binders in the top 5% of predicted peptides. moreover, a single docking of hla-dp <dig>  in complex with a self-peptide derived from the hla-dr α-chain  was analysed using rosettadock. this characterised more fully the interacting amino acids across the peptide – mhc binding interface, helping identify amino acid preferences at each position of the peptide binding core.

peptide binding pocket  <dig>  consists of  <dig> residues . ten of them are conserved and only asp/gly84β is dimorphic . dp <dig> and dp <dig> contain asp84β, while dp <dig> and dp <dig> contain gly84β as does dp <dig>  aromatic amino acids such as phe, tyr, trp and his, as well as aliphatic ile and leu are able to bind into this pocket. additionally, the asp84β-containing proteins dp <dig> and dp <dig> accept positively charged lys, arg and his . a hydrogen bond is formed between ser53α and nh of peptide position  <dig>  .

the influence of ph on the affinity of peptides binding to hla-dp has two main aspects: influence on peptide protonation/deprotonation and influence on protein binding site protonation/deprotonation. at ph  <dig> , his is positively charged and it is preferred at peptide positions  <dig> to  <dig>  among the five his residues in the hla-dp binding site, only the protonation state of his79β affects peptide binding. at ph  <dig>  an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the peptide position before p <dig>  and the imidazole ε-nitrogen of his79β . this h-bond increases the peptide binding affinity by more than  <dig> orders of magnitude, perhaps explaining the higher experimentally-observed equilibrium binding level seen at ph  <dig>  
 <cit> . the peptide-protein association rate constants greatly increases at ph  <dig>  , while the dissociation rates are almost unchanged in the ph range  <dig>  –  <dig>  
 <cit> . thus, one may speculate that the peptide-protein complex formed in the acidic environment of endosomes will also be stable in the neutral environment of the cell surface.

CONCLUSIONS
for peptide binding to the four most frequent hla-dp proteins , statistically the ds-qms derived through molecular docking simulations at ph  <dig>  gave better predictions than those derived at ph  <dig>  and performed better than current state-of-the-art servers for mhc binding prediction. clear differences are observed in our x-ray-based protein-peptide models: an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to the peptide position before p <dig> and the protonated ε-nitrogen of his79β. this additional hydrogen bond may provide additional stabilization for all peptide regardless of their sequences, provided that they have a sufficiently long n-terminal extension. protonated his residues make favourable interactions at most of the peptide binding core positions.
