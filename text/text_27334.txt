BACKGROUND
plasmids are autonomously-replicating extra-chromosomal circular dna molecules usually nonessential for cell survival under non-selective conditions and widely distributed in prokaryotic cells. because plasmids sometimes bear genes that provide bacteria with functions  that can be adaptive in variable environments, they are often viewed as elements "at the service of" a  pool of bacteria, thus allowing the long-term survival of these lines or species. however, their ability to autonomously replicate makes plasmids possible purely "selfish dna" candidates. indeed, some plasmids exhibit features that seem to be strictly restricted to mechanisms related to their maintenance in cell lines  or dispersal across cell lines or species .

poison-antidote, or toxin-antitoxin  systems, were first discovered on plasmids  <cit>  and associated to plasmid-maintenance mechanisms. later, several ta systems were identified on chromosomes  <cit>  and interpreted as bacterial programmed cell death or stress response loci  <cit> . thought to occur in many prokaryotic species  <cit> , most ta systems are organized as follows: a gene coding for a cytotoxic and stable protein is preceded by a dna sequence coding for an unstable antitoxin  protein or antisense rna that can neutralize the toxic protein or its corresponding mrna, respectively. the instability of the antitoxin protein is due to specific degradation by a protease  <cit> . most systems investigated to date  involve a proteic  antitoxin that efficiently sequesters the toxin, and  exhibit a tandem organization with a single promoter and a small distance , or even an overlap , between the antitoxin and toxin genes . the transcription of the system is auto-regulated by the binding of the antitoxin  to the promoter region of the operon  <cit> . we hypothesize here that, despite the instability of the antitoxin, cells containing such an operon survive probably because the frequency of translation termination is increased after the stop-codon of the antitoxin  making the antitoxin protein more abundant than the toxin protein. once a bacteria has received one or more copies of the system , that cell is 'condemned' either not to loose the operon or to die  because absence of the operon would cause a reduction in the amount of antitoxin relative to the amount of toxin through degradation of the former  prompting, in turn, the poison to exert its toxicity on an essential intracellular host target, such as the gyrase or rna translation mechanisms  <cit> , eventually causing cell death or cell-cycle arrest. note that ta systems have been domesticated as biotechnological tools  <cit>  for facilitating dna engineering and protein production without the use of antibiotics  <cit> .

different ta systems have been described and classified in several families, according to the target of the toxin and/or the nature of the protease that degrades the antitoxin  <cit> . recently, about  <dig> toxin genes have been separated into  <dig> groups on the basis of sequence or structure similarities and gene neighborhood criteria  <cit> : the "families" rele/pare, mazf/kid/ccdb, and doc, as well as the family of proteins sharing a "pin-domain". on the basis of phylogenetic analyses, these families have been suggested to be non-homologous  <cit> , i.e., the ta systems would have appeared at least four times independently during evolution.

as known ta systems, identified on different plasmids, phages, and prokaryotic  genomes are all very small and potentially very divergent , we hypothesize that many ta systems might not be annotated as such in the ncbi database. however, given that  ta-bearing plasmids with broad host range can be found in multiple bacterial species, and  most systems exhibit the structural organization outlined above, we predicted that many more descendent systems than previously described should be detected across a wide range of prokaryotic genomes and plasmids. to detect these putative ta systems, we developed an algorithm, implemented into a computer program, taq v <dig>  , that searches public databases on the basis of predefined similarity and ta-specific structural constraints. our algorithm is complementary to that implemented in rasta-bacteria  <cit> . the latter first identifies sequences exhibiting conserved putative ta domains and then uses structural constrains to further restrict and score the resulting set of putative ta systems. our approach, using a single starting query sequence for each of the pare, doc, and pin families and two starting sequences for the mazf/ccdb family identified over  <dig>  putative ta systems, of which many were unknown. these five groups of sequences are analyzed phylogenetically for a better classification and understanding of ta systems evolution.

RESULTS
in order to produce a single set of homologous sequences per family, we performed one taq v <dig>  search for each family of ta systems starting with a single poison . since we did not find any ccdb sequence during the search using the mazf toxin as query , we also run one search using ccdb from the f plasmid as the starting sequence. in each case, the program taq v <dig>  converged after  <dig> or  <dig> days of computation on a standard intel pentium  <dig> computer  and generated the results summarized in table  <dig> 

values represent the number of sequences in each category. the " in silico inferred toxins" are sequences that meet all the constraints implemented in taq whereas the "bad poisons" do not match the length constraints and the "without antidote poisons" meet the size constraints but do not exhibit an orf of constrained size and position . "artificial" sequences are engineered sequences such as cloning vectors.

although induced expression of the bacterial rele toxin in yeast and in human cell lines indicated the broad potential activity of ta systems  <cit> , none of the sequences that met all the sequence similarity and structural criteria defined in our algorithm are found in eukaryotic genomes. on the other hand, other categories include eukaryotic sequences: e.g., tetrahymena thermophyla , debaryomyces hansenii , and dictyostelium discoideum  in the pare "bad poisons" category, and cryptosporidium hominis  in the pare "without antidote poisons" category; aspergillus fumigatus , coccidioides immitis  macaca mulatta , drosophila melanogaster , mus musculus , homo sapiens ,gallus gallus , rattus norvegicus , pan troglodytes , canis lupus , bos taurus  in the doc "bad poisons" category. some of these sequences contain a domain  that has been suggested to be homologous to the doc domain  <cit> .

the run that was started with a single member of the pin family generated  <dig> putative toxins,  <dig> bad poisons, and  <dig> without-antidote poisons. among the  <dig> putative toxins,  <dig> are known vapc toxins,  <dig> are unknown, and  <dig> are simply annotated as containing a pin domain. however, as the pin domain is not specific to ta systems, it is highly likely that the first step of our taq algorithm  returns many false positives  that are not efficiently filtered out by the structural-constrain criteria. one example is the flbt protein clearly involved in the flagellum biosynthesis  <cit> ; note that one cannot exclude the possibility that some proteins regulating gene expression  originate from ta systems. surprisingly, taq even identified known phd antitoxins. hence, to avoid comparing non-homologous sequences, we decided to decrease the e-value to 10- <dig>  under that setting, taq did not recover any flbt, phd, or any other sequence that can readily be identified as false positives.

this second run generated  <dig> putative toxins,  <dig> bad poisons, and  <dig> without-antidote poisons. among the  <dig> putative toxins,  <dig> are known vapc toxins,  <dig> are unknown,  <dig> are annotated as toxins and  <dig> as containing a pin domain .

we compared the results of taq to those obtained by rasta-bacteria  <cit> , a program that searches for putative ta systems in a specific organism but that restricts the blast search to known ta domains before applying additional structural constraints . rasta-bacteria finds many more putative ta elements  than does taq because the latter uses more stringent size criteria  to minimize the risk of false positives that would seriously jeopardize the phylogenetic analyses. rasta-bacteria and taq have different objectives as the former attempts to score putative toxin or antitoxin elements whereas the latter attempts to generate a phylogeny among poison sequences that are very likely to belong to real ta systems .

for a meaningful evolutionary analysis of the large sets of proteins recovered by taq, an additional criterion  would be warranted. unfortunately, rasta-bacteria does not allow, in its present form, to perform automated multiple searches using batch files.

ancestral sequences tree
after initially grouping sequences by query, we manually separated or merged groups for generating low ambiguity alignments. we used  <dig> groups for the pare analysis,  <dig> groups for the mazf analysis,  <dig> groups for the doc analysis, and  <dig> groups for the vapc analysis. sequences within each group were then aligned and used to produce ml phylogenies. then, the  <dig> inferred ml root sequences  for the pare analysis  were themselves aligned and analyzed phylogenetically . the final trees and their branch support values are available through tiq v <dig> , a java program, available at  <cit>  . tiq allows browsing the trees, select branches, perform searches of ncbi annotation fields , etc.) and filter sequences according to the host taxonomy. the  <dig> ccdb sequences were simply incorporated into a single mrbayes analysis.

supertree
for the pare analysis, after grouping hits on the basis of the query sequence that generated them, we obtained  <dig> groups of which many were highly redundant. using the algorithm described in the methods section, we reduced that number to  <dig> partially-overlapping groups that collectively contain all putative ta systems uncovered here. we then inferred the ml phylogenetic relationships among sequences within each group, generating  <dig> trees that are partially overlapping in terms of the included sequence. the overlapping trees were then used as input for "supertree" inference . the strict consensus among the  <dig> best supertrees  is available through tiq v <dig>  . similarly, for the mazf analysis, the initial  <dig> highly redundant groups were reduced to  <dig> partially-overlapping groups that collectively contain all uncovered putative ta systems. the single best supertree  is available through tiq v <dig> . for the doc analysis, the initial  <dig> highly redundant groups were reduced to  <dig> partially-overlapping groups that collectively contain all uncovered putative ta systems. the strict consensus among the  <dig> best supertrees  is available through the java program tiq v <dig> . finally, for the vapc analysis, the initial  <dig> highly redundant groups were reduced to  <dig> partially-overlapping groups that collectively contain all uncovered putative ta systems. the 50% majority-rule consensus among the  <dig> best supertrees  with a cut-off value of 50% is available through the java program tiq v <dig> . no supertree analysis was run for the  <dig> ccdb sequences given the small size of that dataset.

consensus among methods
given  the very large divergence among the very short poison sequences from ta systems ,  the heuristic nature of the inference methods used here , and  that ml models used are only approximations of the real substitution process across the billions of years of ta systems history, a high degree of uncertainty is very likely attached to the phylogeny analyses performed here. however, given that the two heuristics used are quite different , a consensus between the two resulting phylogenies might highlight the most robust portions of these trees. hence, for each major family, we combined the trees generated by the two approaches into an adams consensus tree . an adams consensus  <cit>  typically preserves more structure than a strict consensus by displaying "nestings", rather than clades, shared among trees  a is a subset of b, and  the leaves in set a have a more recent common ancestor in t than do the leaves in set b). in other words, one group is said to nest within a larger group if the most recent common ancestor of the smaller group is a descendant of the most recent common ancestor of the larger group, which needs not require monophyly of either group. the consensus trees, presented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are also available  through the java program tiq v <dig>  . the ccdb tree  is also available through tiq.

origin of the ta systems
very little objective data is available to shed light on the origin of the ta systems. considering the structural relative similarity  among known systems, gerdes  <cit>  suggested that they all share a common ancestor. however, the evolutionary relationships and functional similarities among ta families are unclear. for example, the similarities between, on one hand, toxin sequences from the rele family and, on the other hand, those from the pare family  demonstrate that the two families are homologous . however, rele and pare proteins are thought to exert their toxic activity on different targets: mrna cleavage for rele and dna gyrase for pare  <cit> . similarly, mazf and ccdb proteins are thought to be homologous because they share the same basic tertiary structure  <cit> . finally, schmidt et al.  <cit>  described an "hybrid" ta system, i.e., whose antidote sequence is similar to the maze antitoxin, whereas its toxin sequence is similar to rele, providing a putative evolutionary link between the rele/pare and mazf/ccdb superfamilies.

conversely, other scholars suggested that ta systems evolved several times independently. for example, on the basis of protein domains and "gene-neighborhood analysis", anantharaman and aravind  <cit>  proposed that rele/pare, mazf/ccdb, doc, and pin form different ta superfamilies that have been assembled more than once during the evolution, from a limited pool of protein domains.

to test for the possible homology among ta superfamilies, we run taq using psi-blast criteria  more permissive than in a classical taq run . using pare as input, we found 4ζ toxins from the ω -ε -ζ system, as well as a sequence containing the pin domain . this result suggests possible homologies among pare/rele, ζ, and vapc families, and the rapid accumulation of new prokaryotic genome sequences might bridge additional putative phylogenetic gaps among ta families. moreover, our first run of taq with a vapc toxin as initial query retrieved some phd antitoxins .

we also input  <dig> sequences of putative toxins  uncovered by taq v <dig>  into rasta-bacteria  <cit> . when rasta-bacteria gave more than one possible domain per sequence, we only considered the domain with the highest score. strikingly, seven of our putative poisons belonging to the rele superfamily  were assigned non-rele domains  by rasta-bacteria. although these results exhibit low scores, they might prove to be the first objective link, in terms of homology, among ta superfamilies. in-vivo experiments, identifying the nature of the domains by which these proteins exert their putative toxicity, would probably shed light on this exciting hypothesis .

CONCLUSIONS
all analyses presented here include exclusively sequences that met all similarity and structural constraints implemented in taq v <dig> , i.e., the "in-silico inferred toxin" sequences. however, many additional hits meet the similarity criterion but fail to meet either the size criterion or the presence of a putative antidote . it would be particularly interesting to extend the phylogenetic analyses performed here to these additional sequences, especially for those found in eukaryotic genomes, to assess their likelihood to represent functional or degenerated poison genes.

putative toxins particularly divergent in the phylogenies presented in figure  <dig>  to  <dig>  as well as those making the possible link between different ta superfamilies , must be tested in vivo to  authenticate their toxic nature,  identify their mode of action, and/or  possibly confirm their hybrid character . finally, it would be worth investigating which of the two proteases known to degrade antitoxins are active against the antitoxins of the tested putative ta systems.
