BACKGROUND
gene conversion involves a non-reciprocal transfer of information between two homologous genes where one segment replaces nucleotides in its corresponding homolog. gene conversion is generally considered a homogenization force on the genome, although it has two distinct consequences. in homogenization, gene conversion causes concerted evolution in gene families through reciprocal exchange of sequence between paralogs  <cit> . however, diversification can occur, for example, when a pseudogene or otherwise unexpressed gene segment is transferred into another, functioning gene. alteration of gene function through diversification can have advantageous consequences, such as in immune system diversification involving the major histocompatibility complex genes  <cit> .

in eukaryotes, gene conversion has been classified into two types based on the conversion targets; one involves allele conversion and the other involves repeated genes. conversion between alleles occurs at the same loci on sister-chromatids or between homologous chromosomes. conversion events between repeated genes can occur at different loci on the same chromatid, sister-chromatids, homologous chromosomes, or non-homologous chromosomes  <cit> . these events leave signatures in genome sequences that are detectable through specialized statistical analysis. in this study, we use such statistical methods with genome sequence data and annotations to study the gene conversion history of multigene families in the rice genome.

genome wide searches for gene conversion events between paralogs have been performed in yeast  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , and mouse and rat  <cit> . significant evidence for gene conversion events has been detected on human chromosomes  <dig> and y  <cit> . analyses of selected regions of the arabidopsis thaliana genome suggest that the divergence during the process of gene evolution is affected by gene conversion  <cit> . however, prior to our work, no genome-wide conversion analysis has been reported for plants. as a result, little is known about how gene conversion influences the evolution of multigene families in plant genomes.

the rice genome has evidence of ancient whole genome duplication, as well as recent chromosomal and segmental duplication  <cit> . because of the increase in paralogs through duplication, the rice genome may have undergone potentially many gene-conversion and unequal-crossover events in its evolution. studies of these events can enhance our understanding of evolutionary processes behind multigene families in the rice genome. toward this end, we have mined the rice genome database  <cit>  for gene conversion traces.

RESULTS
number and length of gene conversions detected in the rice genome
we analyzed a dataset of  <dig> multigene families, each family with at least three paralogs. in a total of  <dig> genes, we detected  <dig> gene conversion events involving  <dig> genes in  <dig> families. approximately 66% of these conversions involved sequences shorter than  <dig> nucleotides . the number of conversions identified by the detection algorithm declines rapidly as sequence length approaches zero.  the average length of all conversions is  <dig> nucleotides and ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. in general, the length distribution of converted regions in the rice genome is similar to those found in other species  <cit> . short conversions with fewer than about  <dig> nucleotides are usually considered to be artifacts . our analysis included six conversion events involving match lengths with less than  <dig> nucleotides; although these six events have low reliability, their presence does not influence the interpretation of our results.

gene conversion with pseudogenes may accelerate gene family evolution; in this model, pseudogenes are postulated as a source of genetic information. the introduction of genetic material from pseudogenes may lead to higher divergence in orthologs between rice and related species. to test this hypothesis, we established rice gene families as having either low similarity  or high similarity  to arabidopsis thaliana. hs gene families are defined as having statistically significant sequence similarity to arabidopsis genes. conversely, ls gene families have low similarity to arabidopsis. it follows that ls gene families are more likely to be rice specific.

we categorized the  <dig> conversions detected in  <dig> ls and  <dig> hs gene families as described in methods. among the  <dig> conversion events, we identified those conversions involving pseudogenes in ls and hs families. the fraction of pseudogenes was approximately 56% in the ls families and 21% in the hs families .

to rule out effects from assembly artifacts on our study, we performed a similar analysis on the japonica rice genome published by the international rice genome sequencing project   <cit> . the gene conversion characteristics were indistinguishable between the two assemblies .

distribution of conversion events on the chromosomes
our analysis of the rice genome detected  <dig> genes likely to be involved in  <dig> conversion events. to determine the distribution of gene conversion across the genome, we mapped the converted genes to chromosomes . we were also interested in chromosomes with more conversions than the average number of conversions per unit length. to assess this, we estimated that the average number of conversions per million nucleotides for the entire genome was ~ <dig> . based on the average frequency of  <dig>  conversions per megabase, the number of conversions was found to be relatively uniform as a function of length for each chromosome. in the  <dig> events,  <dig> conversion pairings occurred within the same chromosome  as intra-chromosomal conversions;  <dig> conversion events occurred between chromosomes  as inter-chromosomal conversions.

from a total of  <dig> gene pairs in the  <dig> multigene families,  <dig> pairs were located on different chromosomes, with  <dig> pairs co-located on the same chromosome. it follows that the proportion of inter-chromosomal pairs involved in conversions was ~8% , and intra-chromosomal pairs involved in conversions was ~16% . although the number of inter-chromosomal conversion events was higher than intra-chromosomal conversion, the inter-chromosomal fraction was lower with respect to the potential for conversion based on total gene pairs. thus, candidate pairs on the same chromosome apparently result in a higher likelihood for gene conversion. this does not necessarily represent an intrinsic bias for intra-chromosomal gene conversion; alternatively, it may represent an opportunistic positioning for gene conversion to occur.

the  <dig> inter-chromosomal conversion events are distributed non-uniformly among the twelve chromosomes of the rice genome. the conversion events are significantly more frequent between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> than the average . the conversion distributions are shown in figure  <dig> for each chromosome.

to determine the extent of segmental duplication on the observed conversion events, we compared conversion data with duplicated segments in the beijing indica assembly  <cit> . for all  <dig> inter-chromosome conversion events, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  inter-chromosome conversion events were involved in the segmental duplications.

conversion bias based on sequence similarity and orientation
to compare the sequence similarity of gene pairs involved in conversions to gene pairs not involved in conversions, we aligned entire gene sequences as described in methods. the fraction of gene pairs involved in conversion events had significantly higher sequence similarity compared to all gene pairs . to test if the converted regions themselves influenced the higher similarity in the conversion group, we also calculated similarities of genes in conversion pairs, omitting the converted regions from the analysis. no significant difference was found between before and after omitting the converted regions ; the higher sequence similarity of gene pairs involved in conversion was not only a feature of the converted regions. in fact, most gene pairs not involved in conversions share statistically significant similarities in about 30–60% of their sequences with an average sequence similarity of 45%. in contrast, gene pairs involved in conversions exhibit a greater sequence similarity in the range of 60–80%. these results are consistent with findings that gene conversion is favored between similar genes  <cit> .

for the  <dig> intra-chromosomal conversions, the conversion frequency decreased with the physical distance between gene pairs along the chromosome . the gene pairs separated by less than  <dig> kb demonstrated the highest conversion frequency; these could be considered closely linked genes. for gene pairs separated by more than ~ <dig> kb, conversion was infrequent.

the directions between gene pairs were also examined. among the  <dig> gene pairs,  <dig> had the same direction and  <dig> had reverse directions. in the  <dig> conversion events,  <dig>  occurred between gene pairs with the same direction . the proportions of conversions with same-direction gene pairs  and reverse-direction gene pairs  were similar. the larger number of gene conversion events in the same direction coincides with the larger number of gene pairs in the same direction; however, from our data we cannot determine whether the conversion bias is an intrinsic preference.

evolutionary selection correlated to gene function
to determine if gene pairs involved in conversions are subject to evolutionary selection pressure, synonymous substitution rates  and non-synonymous substitution rates  were used. the ka/ks ratio can reflect the selection pressure between gene pairs caused by evolutionary processes. we calculated and compared the ka/ks ratios for two groups:  the closest homologs in each multigene family where at least one homolog was involved in gene conversion and  all close homologs in each multigene family . the ka/ks profiles for the two groups were indistinguishable .

we assessed the function of genes involved in conversions using the protein nr database at ncbi  <cit> . although the function of many genes is presently unknown, we identified approximately <dig> gene families involved in conversions to be related to disease or bacteria resistance. these include genes coding for phospholipase d, cytochrome p <dig>  receptor-like kinase and receptor kinase-like proteins. some conversions were also found in related arabidopsis gene families  <cit> . . the highest conversion frequency was found in the phospholipase d  gene family. phospholipase d has been identified as an enzyme generating secondary messengers in plants, triggering defense against bacterial attacks  <cit> .

discussion
the proliferation of duplications during the evolution of the rice genome may have increased the potential for gene conversion and crossover events within multigene families through an increase in donor sequences. in our analysis of rice, the likelihood for gene conversion was found to be greater between pairs on the same chromosome than pairs on different chromosomes, even though more pairs were found for the latter case. the large number of duplicated repeats between chromosomes provides numerous opportunities for inter-chromosomal gene conversion. that only ~9% of gene conversion occurred between pairs involved in inter-chromosome segmental duplications indicates that the observed conversions were primarily from other sources.

our analysis considers fragments with uncharacteristically high similarity as candidates for gene conversion. high-similarity between fragments may also be caused by strong stabilizing selection. however, the fragments identified in gene conversion events are situated in spans of sequence flanked by sequence with low similarity. the low-similarity context suggests gene conversion and unequal crossing over as possible explanations for the high-similarity inner fragments.

we mapped all identified conversions onto the rice genome sequence . the most frequent conversions were between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig>  our data show a decrease in intra-chromosomal gene conversion frequency as the distance between genes increase. this distance dependence corresponds to previous genome-wide studies of yeast  <cit> . in c. elegans, a high proportion of conversion was observed between tandemly duplicated members of gene families  <cit> . the higher conversion frequency between genes with short separation on the same chromosome may be a consequence of a relationship between conversion and recombination. in arabidopsis, it was found that the upper limit of pairwise distance between genes involved in conversion is  <dig> kb  <cit> . this is similar to the value we found in the rice genome .

conversions involving pseudogenes could accelerate gene family evolution, and may accelerate divergence of some gene families relative to their orthologs. in this study, we found that pseudogenes are more prone to participate in gene conversion in the ls gene families than in hs gene families in the rice genome. thus, conversion with pseudogenes in ls gene families may contribute to the acceleration of ls gene evolution. the rationale behind this is linked to the susceptibility of pseudogenes to accumulate mutations more rapidly than expressed genes, which may then be transferred to conversion partners. this may occur where pseudogene fragments are recruited into functional genes. by definition, ls genes have low similarity with arabidopsis, which means ls gene families are potentially rice-specific. based on this, we can postulate that inter-conversion with pseudogenes may be a source of rice-specific genes. a similar mechanism is suspected for some human speciation events  <cit> . moreover, our findings support the view that pseudogenes contain potential material for new genes  <cit> .

the question remains whether genes involved in conversions are subject to selective pressure that differs from non-converted genes. a mechanism has been suggested that favors selection of some gene clusters in the tomato plant exhibiting traces of gene conversion and conferring disease resistance  <cit> . but does this occur in rice and is it genome wide? we calculated ka and ks values and their ratios for groups of gene with and without conversions – no differences were observed between the two groups. these similar ka/ks ratios may indicate that the genes involved in conversions were not subject to significant selective pressure. the indistinguishable ka/ks ratios of gene pairs involved in conversion imply that the genome-wide gene conversions were not tightly linked to selection pressure in the rice genome. as suggested by mondragon-palomino and gaut, these indistinguishable ka/ks ratios may be a result of both methodological and biological influences  <cit> . inter-conversions through recombination and gene conversion may also influence the accuracy of ka/ks analysis  <cit> . although the co-occurrence of gene conversion and positive selection has been found in some studies, there is evidence that gene conversion is independent of positive selection  <cit> .

the diversification within gene families could be caused by conversion with variant paralogs  <cit> . this mechanism has been widely observed in mammalian immune systems  <cit> . in tomato and arabidopsis, gene conversion has been detected in genes related to disease and bacteria resistance  <cit> . our genome-wide analysis of rice identified at least fourteen such genes potentially influenced by gene conversion events. some of these genes have counterparts in arabidopsis  <cit> , while others were specific to rice. our results contribute to the view that intergenic gene conversion can create variety within a gene family, providing a mechanism for the adaptive evolution, such as disease resistance  <cit> . the diversified paralogs conferring disease resistance would be advantageous for adaptive reorganization and response to various diseases or bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
we have detected  <dig> gene conversion events in the rice genome. the overall characteristics of gene conversion in the rice genome suggest influences by extensive duplication events throughout the evolution of rice. our data further suggest that conversion with pseudogenes may have accelerated the evolution of multigene families. in particular, the adaptive evolution of disease resistance in rice may have been significantly influenced by gene conversion.
