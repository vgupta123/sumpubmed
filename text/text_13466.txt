screening of main factors influences cholesterol oxidase production by plackett–burman design
in order to determine the variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production, different nutritional and environmental variables were evaluated in a two-steps experimental design strategy. in the first step, a two factorial design, plackett–burman statistical experimental design, is used to identify the critical variables which required for elevation of cholesterol oxidase production. plackett–burman statistical experimental design is very useful for screening the most important factors for enzyme production with respect to their main effects  <cit> . the total number of the experiments which must be carried out according to plackett–burman design is n +  <dig>  where n is the number of variables  <cit> . a total of  <dig> independent  and four unassigned variables  were screened in plackett–burman experimental design. dummy variables  are used to estimate experimental errors in data analysis. the fifteen different independent variables are shown in table  <dig> including cholesterol, starch, glucose, yeast extract, peptone, 2so <dig>  k2hpo <dig>  nacl, mgso <dig>  feso <dig>  temperature, incubation time, inoculum size, agitation speed and ph were chosen to be screened by plackett burman experiment. each variable is represented at two levels, high and low denoted by  and , respectively. the experiment in  <dig> runs was conducted to study the selected variables effect on cholesterol oxidase production. all trials were performed in duplicate and the average of cholesterol oxidase activities were used as responses. plackett–burman experimental design is based on the first order model:   <dig> y=β0+∑βixi

statistical screening of fermentation process variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> using two-level fractional factorial design, plackett-burman design
plackett-burman  design was used to determine which variables significantly affect cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig>  compared with other medium design strategies, the plackett-burman design is simple, fast method suitable for screening multiple variables in one experiment and is often used to evaluate the most important and significant variables affecting culture requirements for fermentation and enzyme production. in order to evaluate the effect of physical parameters , carbon sources , nitrogen sources 2so4), in addition to energy sources , and metals  for the maximum production of cholesterol oxidase by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig>  plackett-burman design was applied to determine the most important factors.

the plackett-burman design for the nineteen variables along with the corresponding responses for cholesterol oxidase production are shown in table  <dig>  plackett-burman experiments showed wide variation  in cholesterol oxidase production; this variation reflected the importance of medium optimization to attain higher cholesterol oxidase production.table  <dig> twenty-trial plackett–burman experimental design for evaluation of independent variables with coded values along with the observed cholesterol oxidase activity

the “-1” sign correspond to the minimum value and the “ + 1” sign correspond to the maximum value of the input parameter range

the pareto chart illustrates the order of significant effects of the variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production in plackett-burman experimental design . it displays the absolute values of the effects, and draws a reference line on the chart. any effect that extends past this reference line is potentially important.

the percentages of contributions of the variables are given in table  <dig>  the results revealed that inoculum size, 2so <dig>  ph and cholesterol are the most contributing variables with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %; respectively.

the analysis of variance  of the experimental design was calculated, and the sum of square, mean square, f-value, t-value, p-value and confidence level are given in table  <dig>  the significance of the model was calculated by the p-value. the p-value  serves as a tool for checking the significance of each of the parameter. the model f-value of  <dig>  and p-value of  <dig>  implies that the model is significant. there is only a  <dig>  % chance that a “model f-value” this large could occur due to noise. values of “prob > f”  less than  <dig>  indicate model terms are significant.

the data revealed that, nine variables 2so4) were found to significantly affect cholesterol oxidase production while the remaining six variables  have not significant effect on the cholesterol oxidase production . in this connection the analysis showed that, inoculum size  with a probability value of  <dig>  was determined to be the most significant factor affecting cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> at  <dig>  % confidence followed by 2so <dig>  , ph   and cholesterol  , the lower probability values indicate the more significant variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production. also, it was clear that among the four variables, only inoculum size exerted a negative effects, whereas the other variables 2so <dig> and cholesterol) exerted positive effect on cholesterol oxidase production, which means that the increase in the concentrations of ph value, 2so <dig> and cholesterol concentration and decrease in inoculum size could exert positive effect on cholesterol oxidase production.

the r <dig> values provide a measure of how much variability in the observed response values can be explained by the experimental variables. the r <dig> value is always between  <dig> and  <dig>  when r <dig> is closer to the  <dig>  the model is stronger and better to predict the response  <cit> . the value of the determination coefficient  was found to be  <dig>  indicates that  <dig>  % of the variability in cholesterol oxidase production could be explained by the independent variables used in the study and only  <dig>  % of the total variations are not explained by these variables. the adjusted r <dig>  is also very high that indicates that the model is very significant  <cit> . the “pred r-squared” of  <dig>  is in reasonable agreement with the “adj r-squared” of  <dig> . this indicated a good adjustment between the experimental and predicted values. “adeq precision” measures the signal to noise ratio. a ratio greater than  <dig> is desirable. our ratio of  <dig>  indicates an adequate signal.

a lower value of the coefficient of variation %  indicates a greater reliability of the experimental performance. the predicted residual sum of squares  is a measure of how well the model fits each point in the design. the smaller the press statistic, the better the model fits the data points. our value of press is  <dig> . the model shows standard deviation and mean value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

the first order polynomial equation was derived after performing regression analysis on the results and representing cholesterol oxidase production as a function of the independent variables to obtain the optimum response. by neglecting the insignificant variables, the following regression equation in terms of coded variables was obtained:  <dig> ycholesteroloxidaseactivity=+ <dig> ‐ <dig> a+ <dig> b‐ <dig> c+ <dig> d+ <dig> e‐ <dig> f+ <dig> g+ <dig> h‐ <dig> j+ <dig> k+ <dig> l+ <dig> m‐ <dig> n+ <dig> o+ <dig> p‐ <dig> s‐ <dig> t 

where y is cholesterol oxidase production, and a, b, c, e, f, h, j, k and l are temperature, incubation time, inoculum size, ph, glucose, cholesterol, yeast extract, peptone and 2so <dig> respectively. the coefficient of each variable represents the effect extent of these variables on cholesterol oxidase production.

on the basis of t stat , cholesterol concentration, ph and 2so <dig> were chosen for further optimization using central composite design experiments , since these factors had the most positive significant effects on cholesterol oxidase production.

model adequacy checking
as observed from box–cox plot , the blue line indicates the current transformation  and the green line indicates the best lambda value , while the red lines indicate the minimum and maximum 95 % confidence interval values . so that the model is well fit to the experimental data obtained and well satisfies the assumptions of the analysis of variance.fig.  <dig> box- cox plot of model transformations



in a confirmatory experiment, to evaluate the accuracy of plackett-burman, a medium of the following composition: temperature 30 °c; incubation time 7 days; inoculum size 2; agitation speed 200 rpm; ph 8; glucose 10 g/l; starch 10 g/l; cholesterol 2 g/l; yeast extract 4 g/l; peptone 5 g/l; 2so <dig> 8 g/l; k2hpo <dig> 1 g/l; nacl  <dig>  g/l; mgso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l; feso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l, which expected to be optimum gives cholesterol oxidase activity of  <dig>  u/ml which is higher than result obtained from the basal medium before applying plackett burman by more than two times .

various compounds, such as cholesterol, yeast extract  <cit> , yeast extract, potato starch, peptone and malt extract  <cit>  have been recorded to be substrates for an enhanced cholesterol oxidase production. cholesterol is utilized widely by different microorganisms as a carbon and energy source  <cit> . different microorganisms such as brevibacterium, corynebacterium, arthrobacter, nocardia, mycobacterium, and streptomyces have the ability to degrade cholesterol. the first step of microbial assimilation of cholesterol is the oxidation of the 3β- hydroxyl group by cholesterol oxidase  <cit> . therefore, cholesterol assimilating microorganisms are generally considered to produce cholesterol oxidases. yehia et al.  <cit>  reported that the growth and assimilation of cholesterol by the tested bacterial isolates were affected greatly by concentration of cholesterol used in the fermentation medium, whereas the maximum percentage of cholesterol assimilation  by the enterococcus hirae strain was achieved at 1 g/l of the added cholesterol and maximal assimilation of cholesterol by streptomyces fradiae  <cit>  and rhodococcus erythropolis atcc  <dig>  <cit>  was obtained when used  <dig> g/l.

the ph of the cultivation medium is very important for the microbial growth and metabolism, and hence, for the production of metabolites. the ph may have a direct effect on the cell, or it may indirectly affect it by varying the dissociation degree of the medium components  <cit> . the ph value of the culture medium plays a critical role in the optimal physiological performance of the cells and the transport of various nutrient components across the cell membrane, and the cholesterol assimilation is affected by a change in the ph value of the media. it was previously reported that the optimal ph values for cholesterol assimilation are  <dig>  for streptomyces fradiae  <cit>  and  <dig>  for rhodococcus erythropolis atcc  <dig>  <cit> . moreover, it was found that, optimal ph value required to attain maximum growth and assimilation of cholesterol  in the liquid medium by enterococcus hirae was ph  <dig>  using  <dig>  m acetate buffer and  <dig>  m phosphate buffer  <cit> . solingen et al.  <cit>  reported that an alkaline novel streptomyces species isolated from east african soda lakes have an optimal ph  <dig> 

voelker and altaba  <cit>  estimated the role of different organic and inorganic nitrogen sources for growth and production of secondary metabolite from a streptomycetes. in general, cholesterol oxidase production was enhanced far more by using organic nitrogen than inorganic nitrogen. this may be due to organic nitrogen contains most types of growth factors and amino acids important for the bacterial growth and could be metabolized by cells directly, consequently enhancing cholesterol oxidase production  <cit> . sabry  <cit>  reported that ammonium sulphate, sodium nitrate and ammonium nitrate are the best nitrogen sources used for cholesterol assimilation by pseudonocardia compacta s- <dig>  ammonium salts have shown the highest effect on cholesterol oxidase production by arthrobacter simplex  <cit> . the cell mass obtained using the growth stimulating nitrogen sources, namely yeast extract and 2hpo <dig>  supports the cholesterol oxidase accumulation as induced by the cholesterol substrate in the cell wall  <cit> . among inorganic and organic nitrogen sources, it was revealed that yeast extract had more influence on cholesterol oxidase production than 2so <dig>   <cit> . according to lee et al.  <cit> , study on rhodococcus equi no.  <dig> showed that yeast extract at  <dig> – <dig>  % w/v was the best nitrogen source for cholesterol oxidase production. in a similar study, rhodococcus equi 2c showed maximum production of cholesterol oxidase with yeast extract at  <dig>  %w/v  <cit> .

statistical optimization of fermentation process variables for cholesterol oxidase production using central composite design 
the results indicate the effectiveness of the plackett-burman design in identifying the factors with a positive significant influence on the cholesterol oxidase production. as plackett-burman design is inappropriate to study the mutual interaction of process variables, therefore the level of significant factors needed further optimization. thereafter the exact optimal values for the individual significant factors were determined using central composite design experiments. the significant variables with positive effect were fixed at high level. the variables which exerted a negative effect on cholesterol oxidase production were maintained in all trials at their low level for further optimization by central composite design; other insignificant variables were set at their low level of placket-burman design design as the following: temperature 30 °c; incubation time 7 days; inoculum size  <dig> ; agitation speed 150 rpm; glucose 10 g/l; starch 7 g/l; yeast extract 4 g/l; peptone 5 g/l; k2hpo <dig>  <dig>  g/l; nacl  <dig>  g/l; mgso <dig> h2o  <dig>  g/l.

placket-burman design results revealed that, ph , cholesterol concentration , and 2so <dig>  were the most significant positive independent variables affecting cholesterol oxidase production, thus they were selected for further optimization using five level central composite design . table  <dig> shows the three independent variables and their concentrations at different coded and actual levels of the variables employed in the design matrix.table  <dig> central composite design representing the response of cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> as influenced by initial ph , cholesterol  and ammonium sulphate  along with the predicted cholesterol oxidase production and residuals and the levels of variables with actual factor levels corresponding to coded factor levels



central composite design matrix and responses  for the  <dig> runs of the design are presented in table  <dig>  which shows considerable variation in the amount of cholesterol oxidase activity. based on the experimental data obtained; cholesterol oxidase activity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u/ml, the highest levels of cholesterol oxidase activity were obtained in runs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  with values of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  u/ml respectively, where ph  <dig>  cholesterol concentration 3 g/l, 2so <dig> 8 g/l were used, while the minimum cholesterol oxidase activity was observed in run number  <dig> where ph  <dig>  cholesterol concentration 3 g/l, 2so <dig> 10 g/l were used. in table  <dig>  the observed values for cholesterol oxidase activity is compared with the predicted values from the model.

the data were analyzed using design expert®  <dig>  for windows to perform statistical analysis. the determination coefficient  of the model was  <dig>   indicating that  <dig>  % of variability in the production of cholesterol oxidase was attributed to the selected independent variables and only  <dig>  % % of the total variance could not be explained by the model. the highest r <dig> value showed the good agreement between the experimental results and the predicted values by the model  <cit> . if r2-value of the regression model is higher than  <dig> , it was considered as having a very high correlation  <cit> . therefore, the present r2-value reflected a very good fit between the observed and predicted responses, and implied that the model is reliable for cholesterol oxidase production in the current study. the “pred r-squared” of  <dig>  is in reasonable agreement with the “adj r-squared” of  <dig> . this indicated a good correlation between the predicted and observed values. “adeq precision” measures the signal to noise ratio. a ratio greater than  <dig> is desirable. our ratio of  <dig>  indicates an adequate signal. usually, the higher value of the coefficient of variation %  indicated the lower reliability of the experiment, in the present study, a lower value of c.v.  indicated a better reliability of the experimental results  <cit> . the predicted residual sum of squares  is a measure of how well the model fits each point in the design. the smaller the press statistic indicates better model fits for the data points. our value of press is  <dig> . the model shows standard deviation and mean value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the positive coefficients for x1x <dig>  indicate that the interaction effect between the two variables increase cholesterol oxidase production, while negative coefficients indicate that the interaction effect between the two variables decrease in cholesterol oxidase production.table  <dig> regression statistics of ccd for optimization of cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae-42

the model adequacy was checked using analysis of variance  which was tested using fisher’s statistical analysis and the results are shown in table  <dig>  the model f-value of  <dig>  indicate the model is significant. there is only a  <dig>  % chance that a “model f-value” this large could occur due to noise. values of “prob > f” less than  <dig>  indicate model terms are significant. in this case x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig> x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig>  x <dig> are significant model terms. values greater than  <dig>  indicate the model terms are not significant. the “lack of fit f-value” of  <dig>  implies the lack of fit is significant. there is only a  <dig>  % chance that a “lack of fit f-value” this large could occur due to noise .table  <dig> analysis of variance  for ccd results used for optimizing cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae-42

a second-order polynomial model  was proposed to calculate the optimum levels of ph, cholesterol concentration and 2so <dig>  to evaluate the relationship between cholesterol oxidase production and independent variables and to determine the maximum cholesterol oxidase production corresponding to the optimum levels of these variables. the second-order polynomial equation that defines predicted response  in terms of the independent variables  was obtained:  <dig> y=+ <dig> − <dig> x1− <dig> x2− <dig> x3+ <dig> x1x2− <dig> x1x3− <dig> x2x3− <dig> x12− <dig> x22− <dig> x <dig> 

where the y is the predicted cholesterol oxidase activity, ph , cholesterol concentration , and 2so <dig> .

three dimensional plots
the three dimensional response surface curves were plotted to understand the interaction of the variables and the optimal levels of each variable required for the optimal cholesterol oxidase production. three dimensional plots for the combinations of the three variables  were generated by plotting the response  on z-axis against two independent variables while keeping the other variable at its center point .

the 3d plot , showing the effects of initial ph , and cholesterol  on cholesterol oxidase production. it can be seen that, when the initial ph increases, cholesterol oxidase production gradually increases, but further increase in initial ph above  <dig>  leads to decrease in cholesterol oxidase production. it showed that lower and higher levels of cholesterol support relatively low levels of cholesterol oxidase activity; cholesterol oxidase activity was increased with increase in cholesterol concentration. the maximum cholesterol oxidase activity was attained at middle levels of cholesterol. figure 6b represents the cholesterol oxidase activity as a function of initial ph , ammonium sulphate  by keeping cholesterol  at optimum value, the maximum cholesterol oxidase activity was attained at moderate levels of both initial ph and ammonium sulphate and further increase resulted in a gradual decrease in the cholesterol oxidase activity. in addition, the interaction between these variables were not significant, indicating that there is no significant correlation between each two variables and that they did not help much in increasing the production of cholesterol oxidase production. figure 6c represents the cholesterol oxidase activity as a function of cholesterol , ammonium sulphate  by keeping initial ph  at optimum value, the maximum cholesterol oxidase activity was attained at moderate levels of ammonium sulphate and further increase resulted in a gradual decrease in the cholesterol oxidase activity. it was observed that there is increasing in cholesterol oxidase activity with increasing cholesterol concentration, the maximum cholesterol oxidase activity was obtained at moderate levels and further increase resulted in a gradual decrease in the cholesterol oxidase activity. in addition, the interaction between these variables were significant, indicating that there is significant correlation between each two variables and that they help much in increasing the production of cholesterol oxidase activity.fig.  <dig> three-dimensional response surface plots initial ph , cholesterol  and ammonium sulphate  on the cholesterol oxidase activity



model adequacy checking
the normal probability plot is an important diagnostic tool which indicates whether the residuals follow a normality assumption, in which case the points will follow a straight line expect some scatter even with normal data. figure  <dig> showed that, the normality assumption was satisfied as the residual plot approximated a long a straight line for cholesterol oxidase production, this indicates that the model was well fitted with the experimental results. as the residuals from the fitted model were normally distributed, all the major assumptions of the model had been validated.fig.  <dig> the normal probability plot of residuals to check for normality of residuals for cholesterol oxidase production by streptomyces cavourensis strain neae- <dig> determined by the second-order polynomial equation



validation of the model
the model was validated by repeating the experiments under the optimized conditions, which resulted in the cholesterol oxidase production of  <dig>  u/ml , indicating a strong agreement between them and proving the validity of the model.

CONCLUSIONS
little data has been reported in the literature on the optimization of cholesterol oxidase production by microorganisms using statistical methods. the level of cholesterol oxidase production obtained in our study  following the statistical method is higher than many of the reported values  <cit> .
