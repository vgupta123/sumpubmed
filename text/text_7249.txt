BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are involved in genome organization, chromosomal rearrangements and changes in gene structure and expression. tes are classified into two classes based on their mode of transposition  <cit> . class i includes elements that transpose via rna intermediates. this class can be further divided based on the presence or absence of long terminal repeats . class ii encompasses elements that transpose directly from dna to dna, a reaction catalyzed by a transposase. class ii tes usually harbor terminal inverted repeats  and create target site duplications tsds during transposition. the different te classes encompass autonomous elements, which contain all of the proteins necessary for transposition, and non-autonomous elements, which are defective copies resulting from deletions, insertions or rearrangements that affect the internal sequence. thus, the transposition of non-autonomous elements relies on proteins encoded by autonomous copies. recently, a novel group of class ii dna tes called helitrons was detected in arabidopsis thaliana and caenorhabditis elegans by a repeat-based computational analysis  <cit> . helitrons are rolling-circle transposons that have been found in plants, protozoans, fungi, cnidarians, insects, worms, fishes, frogs, reptiles and mammals . these elements are characterized by their 5′tc and 3′ctrr conserved ends as well as a 16- to 20-nucleotide hairpin-forming sequence located approximately  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the 3′ctrr end  <cit> . helitrons lack tirs, do not generate tsds upon insertion, and are thought to transpose through a replicative rolling circle  mechanism  <cit>  similar to that of bacterial is <dig> elements  <cit> . nevertheless, footprints of helitron somatic excisions have been recently reported in the maize genome, indicating that they may exhibit both replicative and excision-mediated modes of transposition  <cit> . putative autonomous helitrons contain genes encoding a rephel protein with a rolling-circle replication initiator  and a helicase  domain. both domains are thought to be essential for transposition. the rep domain is most likely involved in endonucleolytic dna breaks during the excision and religation of the transposed dna  <cit> . the hel domain encodes a 5′-3′ dna helicase in the pif1/rrm <dig> family that is highly conserved from yeasts to humans and contributes to the maintenance of genome stability  <cit> . when helitrons transpose, they are inserted into at dinucleotides  <cit> . during their transposition, helitrons can capture, amplify and disperse complete genes and gene fragments by a yet unknown mechanism , which seems to be an important tool for the evolution of new helitrons  <cit> . thus, they contribute to a breakdown in genetic colinearity, as previously described in maize haplotypes. helitrons play an important role in the creation of new proteins via exon shuffling and gene duplication. according to yang et al. <cit> , most of the genes captured by helitrons in maize are subjected to genetic drift, 4% of them to purifying selection and 4% of them to adaptive selection, which suggests that there is a benefit for helitron-carrying species. helitrons have highly variable lengths  and abundance in eukaryotic genomes. in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, helitrons account for  <dig> to 5% of the total size of the genome  <cit> , and in mammals such as myotis lucifugus, they account for 3%  <cit> . in plants, the contribution of helitrons to the total genome size is variable. in a. thaliana, helitrons account for more than 2%  <cit> , whereas in oryza the estimations vary from  <dig>  in o.brachyantha <cit>  to 4% in o.sativa <cit> . in maize  the latest analysis reports the presence of  <dig>  helitron copies accounting for  <dig>  % of the b <dig> reference genome  <cit> . in fungi, helitron-like sequences have been identified in silico in the genomes of species belonging to the phylum ascomycetes , as well as in the zygomycete rhizopus oryzae and the phylum basidiomycetes  . however, these studies only reported on the presence of helitrons and their densities; their structural features were not analyzed. thus, we lack a general picture of the structure of fungal helitrons, as well as an understanding of their role in gene capture and their broader genomic impact. pleurotus ostreatus is a white rot basidiomycete that is widely used as a model organism. recently, the genome of the dikaryotic strain n <dig> of p. ostreatus , was comprehensively analyzed. the genome sequences of the monokaryotic parentals pc <dig> and pc <dig> are available  <cit> . sequence analysis of both p. ostreatus strains revealed the presence of helitrons in strain-specific genomic locations, as described for different maize haplotypes. the presence of helitrons led to a lack of synteny between both haplotypes and the occurrence of important rearrangements. with the aim of uncovering new insights into the role of helitrons in the p. ostreatus genome as well as the genomes of other ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, we report on the following: i) their structural features and functional domains, ii) their abundance and occurrence in pc <dig> and pc <dig> genomes, and iii) their ability to capture, create and express new genes. finally, we investigate the helitron landscape in p. ostreatus and other sequenced fungi to understand their origins and evolution in the fungal kingdom.

RESULTS
pleurotus ostreatushelitrons
we designed a pipeline for helitron identification in p. ostreatus  starting with a structure-based approach using helsearch. this approach yielded  <dig> and  <dig> putative helitron families in the pc <dig> and pc <dig> genomes, respectively . our subsequent homology-based approach uncovered another putative helitron family that could not be detected by the first method. after a manual curation of the alignments and the removal of false positives, we obtained two verified helitron families named helpo <dig> and helpo <dig>  both families contain most of the structural and enzymatic features described earlier in plant/animal helitrons such as at insertion specificity, t-5′ and ctrr-3′ ends , the presence of a subterminal palindromic hairpin, and a rolling-circle replication initiator as well as a helicase domain in a common orf . based on the similarity of the 5′ and 3′ boundaries , helitrons of the helpo <dig> family can be further classified into three subfamilies: helpo <dig> , helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig> , with elements ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb length . the similarity of their 5′ and 3′ helitron ends indicates that the helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig>  subfamilies are more closely related, while helpo <dig>  is more distant . helpo <dig> contained elements varying from  <dig>  to 10 kb in length. both the helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> families contain putative autonomous elements, however, the helpo <dig> family is the only one carrying intact non-autonomous copies, all of them belonging to subfamily helpo <dig>  . the flanking regions of the helitron insertion sites  are at-rich. in fact, these regions show an at content of 57%, while the helitrons’ at content is similar to that of the whole genome . the putative autonomous elements of the helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> families carry an orf encoding a rephel helicase of approximately  <dig> aa. the protein contains three motifs defining the rep domain  <cit>  as well as six conserved motifs present in members of the sf <dig> helicase superfamily described in other helitrons   <cit>  and necessary for replication and dna unwinding. using a maximum likelihood approach, we clustered the rephel helicases into three groups , where the helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> proteins were grouped separately. interestingly, the third group lacks the rolling-circle replication initiator but ferries some of the helicase domains. apparently, these helicases do not belong to a specific helitron family. it should be pointed out that putative helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> autonomous elements share about 60-70% similarity to helitron 1_sll_1p of serpula lacrymans <cit>  and helitron2_ppa_1p of physcomytrella <cit> , but only in the regions corresponding to the helitron helicase-like domain  and the pif1-like helicase domain .figure  <dig>

a transcriptional analysis was performed using the rpkm method and the rna-seq reads were mapped to the pc <dig> and pc <dig> homologous genomes. symbol *indicates that the element fits the description shown in the header, while // indicates the contrary.

helitron length polymorphisms were observed in some of the elements. members of the helpo <dig>  subfamily showed two elements of different lengths. the shortest element  was located on chromosome xi, and the largest  was located on chromosome i. the helpo <dig>  subfamily was the only subfamily with non-autonomous elements at identical positions in both genomes. in this sense, it should be noted that the large helpo <dig>  copy appeared as an allele of the short copy on chromosome i. copies of the short helpo <dig>  copy were also found on chromosome ii. in pc <dig>  helitrons were found in ten out of eleven chromosomes. seven chromosomes carried helitrons from both families, while three  carried helitrons from only a single family. chromosomes i, vii and viii carried the highest number of helitrons. clusters of helitrons were present in the regions of chromosomes i and vii  showing 50% gc content. breaks in gene colinearity between pc <dig> and pc <dig> were observed in 66% of the helitron containing regions , as shown in figure  <dig>  the analysis of  <dig> regions of 50 kb adjacent to helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> helitrons  revealed that the frequency of colinearity breaks in these regions was  <dig>  every 50 kb, while the frequency in the whole chromosome i was  <dig>  breaks every 50 kb. according to our results, 40% of the pc <dig> missing counterparts  were present in a different location, while 22% corresponded to other transposable elements, mainly ltr/gypsy, dna/pif-harbinger and dna/cmc-enspm. in chromosome vii, the two helpo <dig>  copies showed  <dig> % similarity. one of the copies was inserted into the left 576-bp inverted repeat found in a  <dig> -kb region present on a chromosome of pc <dig> but was absent in the pc <dig> genome . this region was also found close to the telomere in chromosome xi of pc <dig> and carried  <dig> predicted genes.

helitron captured genes
the helitrons of the helpo <dig> family show a high tendency for gene acquisition/creation, as every intact copy carried from one to four gene-like sequences . by contrast, members of helpo <dig> only contained the rephel helicase. in pc <dig>  putative autonomous elements of the helpo <dig> family carried from one to four captured genes  downstream of the rephel helicase . the captured genes of the helpo <dig>  subfamily were named capa, those from helpo <dig>  were named capb, and those from helpo <dig>  were named capc, capd, cape and capf . the captured gene of the helpo <dig>  copy on chromosome v was named capa <dig> instead of capa due to its low similarity to the other capa genes  carried by the helitrons on chromosome vii. chromosome xi harbors a capb gene in a helpo <dig>  element. interestingly, an extra copy of the helpo <dig>  subfamily carrying  an ltr/gypsy retrotransposon  was found on chromosome i. the ltr/gypsy retrotransposon was inserted in the second reverse reading frame, breaking the rephel helicase orf . several copies of this retroelement were found in chromosomes i, iii, v, ix and xi of pc <dig>  the genes carried by helpo <dig> helitrons can be classified based on their conserved domains as retrotransposon/viral genes or as genes of unknown function.

retrotransposon/viral genes
an analysis of the conserved domains showed significant hits  in a helpo <dig>  copy harboring ltr/gypsy and in a helpo <dig>  copy, both present on chromosome  <dig> . the helpo <dig>  copy on chromosome i carried viral and retrotransposon domains in addition to helitron motifs . blastn searches performed on pc <dig> filtered model genes using intact helitrons as queries showed that this helpo <dig>  was the only helitron harboring plant and animal re-arranged retroviral genes shuttled by a retroelement. the largest helpo <dig>  copy on chromosome i was  <dig>  kb longer than the mean of the lengths of the other helpo <dig>  copies in the p. ostreatus genome , and it bore a small est without a predicted gene model  as well as three predicted genes . the capd gene contains a domain present in the large tegument protein ul <dig> of the herpes virus , cape carries a caulimovirus viroplasmin , and capf carries a predicted nuclease . all of the cap genes described above are exclusively captured by helitrons and do not have additional copies outside helitron boundaries.figure  <dig>

genes of unknown function
capa, capa <dig>  capb and capc, did not bear conserved domains. a blastx query of the entire mycocosm database  revealed that the capa, capa <dig> and capc genes were novel p. ostreatus-specific fungal genes, while capb yielded significant hits for proteins of unknown function that are present in a few species of basidiomycetes: armillaria mellea , dendrothele bispora , fibulorhizoctonia sp. , schizophyllum commune loenen , and suillus brevipes . with the exception of a. mellea , all of the species carried the rephel helicase in the same orientation as the p. ostreatus helitron helpo <dig> , as evidence of the patchy distribution of this helitron subfamily in the phylum basidiomycota.

no hits  for any promoter transcription factor motifs were found in blast searches against fungal  and viral  databases.

transcription
the transcriptional profiles of  <dig> helitrons and  <dig> truncated rephel helicases from the p. ostreatus pc <dig> and pc <dig> genomes were investigated in solid smy cultures using rna-seq in the dikaryotic strain n <dig> . an analysis of rna-seq reads using igv  <cit>  yielded different profiles for the members of different families and subfamilies . in most cases, the rna-seq reads did not fit with the gene models predicted by the jgi, although we also found rna-seq reads that mapped to regions with no annotated models, for example, capc. helitrons in the helpo <dig> family showed higher levels of transcription , in comparison with the elements belonging to the helpo <dig> family. the truncated pif <dig> helicases showed no transcriptional activity, with the exception of helicase id  <dig> . the helpo <dig>  subfamily displayed very high levels of expression  compared with the helpo <dig>   and helpo <dig>  members . rt-qpcr experiments were performed using mrna from the strains pc <dig>  pc <dig> and n <dig> grown in submerged cultures to analyze the expression of the rephel helicases and captured genes independently. for rephel helicases, similar relative profiles were observed in the three strains, although the ranges of the transcriptional levels were different . the rephel helicase of helpo <dig>  was frequently the most highly expressed . helpo <dig>  rephel showed much lower expression levels  and helpo <dig> showed no expression in n <dig> and pc <dig> . virus-like captured genes carried by ltr/gypsy did not show transcription in any strain, and genes of unknown function, such as capa, capa <dig>  capb and capc, showed a strain-specific expression profile. rt-qpcr experiments performed with pc <dig> showed that capa was the most highly expressed gene  whereas much lower  or no transcription  was observed for the rest of these genes. in pc <dig>  the highest expression values corresponded to capc and capa <dig> . in n <dig>  capa was the most highly expressed gene, followed by capc and capa <dig>  . clear differences were observed between the capa and capa <dig> transcription profiles using rt-qpcr. because the primers were designed to amplify more than one gene with the exception of capa <dig>  capd and capf , the transcription levels obtained were the result of the contribution of every rephel helicase and captured gene from each helitron family.figure  <dig>

differential expansion of the helitron-specific helicases in other fungi
tblastn homology-based searches were carried out on the entire mycocosm database  using the helitron helicase-like  and pif1-like helicase  domains as queries. the search yielded  <dig> and  <dig> significant hits in  <dig> genomes  to the helitron helicase-like and pif1-like helicase domains, respectively. the results were used to analyze the expansion of helitron-specific rephel helicases in fungal phyla. we found a clear difference in the occurrence of helitron-like helicases in the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes classes. while 87% of the genomes of the basidiomycetes analyzed contained rephel proteins, only 30% of the ascomycetes contained rephel proteins. this difference is even more striking when we consider that the ascomycetes group comprised a larger number of analyzed genomes. interestingly, the correlation of the presence of both domains was very high  in fungi.

phylogenetic reconstruction of eukaryotic rephel helicases
to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the fungal helitrons identified as well as those from other eukaryotic genomes, we reconstructed molecular phylogenies of the pif1-like helicase and helitron helicase-like domains . an initial dataset containing  <dig> pif1-like helicases from  <dig> fungal genomes  and  <dig> putative autonomous elements obtained from repbase  was used to uncover new insights into the helitron distribution in the eukaryotic domain. a total of  <dig> sequences bore the pif1-like helicase domain,  <dig> carried the helitron helicase-like domain, and  <dig> sequences displayed both domains. after removing duplicated copies, the remaining sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses. the functional domains were extracted from the sequences and aligned using custom python scripts. both analyses  depicted a similar scenario - fungal helitrons were not monophyletic, but rather they appeared in at least four different clades interspersed among metazoan and plant helitrons. in addition, within each fungal clade, the different fungal phyla  appeared mixed.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have shown that helitron transposons are widespread in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . their structural and enzymatic features have been analyzed in depth in plants and animals using computational analyses, uncovering a canonical structure that is widely conserved among the elements in both kingdoms. several tools and pipelines have been published for analyzing helitrons in a diverse range of eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . these approaches rely on either homology-based searches of previously known helitrons or structure-based searches of unique helitron features such as the conserved 3′- terminus. however, fungal helitron-like sequences can lack intact boundaries  <cit> . this characteristic impedes helitron identification using structure-based searches. in p. ostreatus, we show that both the structural and coding features  are present and highly conserved with the structural and coding features present in other helitrons in different kingdoms. nevertheless, the elements of the helpo <dig> family containing a slight variation in the 3′-terminus are not distinguishable using helsearch. this situation necessitates combining homology-based searches, structure-based approaches and manual curation for fungal helitron searches, as described in this paper. in terms of relative abundance, the helitron content of p. ostreatus is similar to that of other basidiomycetes   <cit> . we found that genome assemblies of poor quality critically impacted helitron searches, leading to underestimates of the helitron content. the p. ostreatus pc <dig> genome sequence was assembled into  <dig> scaffolds, which fit with the  <dig> known linkage groups  <cit> . however, the pc <dig> scaffolds were not used as templates for the pc <dig> assembly because our goal was to analyze the effect of helitrons in breaking synteny and the consequences of hemizygous regions with respect to p. ostreatus mushroom yield and enzyme expression. thus, we found the estimation of helitron abundance for the pc <dig> genome to be more accurate than the pc <dig> genome because pc <dig> is assembled into  <dig> scaffolds, most of which are very small in size. p. ostreatus helitrons insert precisely between a and t nucleotides; they often land in at-rich genome regions occupied by other helitrons  <cit> . in p. ostreatus, approximately half of the helitrons were found in retrotransposon-rich regions . this phenomenon is more pronounced in the helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig> elements because they are more abundant. a high percentage of helpo <dig> helitrons were putative autonomous elements carrying captured genes inside their boundaries compared with helpo <dig>  the similarity between the elements belonging to different families and subfamilies  strongly suggests that helitron vertical diversification has occurred. however, recent amplification events are not excluded because both the helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> families contain young elements . notably, the short copy of helpo <dig>   occurs frequently in the pleurotus genome compared with the large one . the long copy contains internal complementary repeats flanking capd and capf genes. these sequences may promote an intrachromosomal rearrangement leading to the formation of a loop that contains the captured lost genes capd, cape and capf. the short copy of helpo <dig>  would then bear only capc, which is later amplified. in the pleurotus genome, the mobilization of ltr/gypsy elements and their insertion into helitrons creates chimeric elements. for example, a ltr/gypsy element containing animal and plant viral sequences present in several basidiomycetes genomes was found in an opposite orientation breaking the rephel helicase orf of a helpo. <dig>  element in p.ostreatus pc <dig>  this finding supports an insertion rather than a capture of the ltr/gypsy element by a helitron. this result greatly differs from that found in plants and animals, where helitrons frequently capture gene fragments from their hosts  <cit> . previous studies by  <cit>  found that chimeric elements formed by helitrons and other tes are rare in eukaryotic genomes.

helitron-mediated amplification and expression of captured genes
pleurotus helitrons contain a subterminal hairpin and a well-conserved 3′-ct[a/t)g end, and they do not generate target site duplications in agreement to what was previously described for other eukaryotes  <cit> . the conservation of the 3′-end structure in helitrons from highly divergent species  suggests that the 3′-end structure plays an important role in transposition  <cit> . earlier studies have hypothesized that this structure could serve as a terminator transposition signal. in this sense, the proposed read-through-model- <dig>   <cit>  suggests that a malfunction of this rc terminator may lead to the acquisition of genes or gene fragments adjacent to the 3′ helitron end. the location of captured genes downstream of the rephel helicase  fits with the rtm <dig> model of gene capturing through new 3′-end acquisition, although there were no clear intermediate rc terminators representing ancient helitron-ends. this could be due to the deletion of the 3′ terminus during transposition or sequence degeneration. in fact, the rc terminator in the new transposon is formed de novo by a terminator-like signal in the surrounding location, as described in the capture of a fragment of the xanthine α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase gene by a non-autonomous helitron-n1_an from a. nidulans <cit> . in plants and animals, helitrons contain genes captured from their hosts  <cit> . in p. ostreatus, the fact that there are very few significant blast hits in databases using capb as a query in addition to the absence of hits using the other cap genes as queries indicates that cap genes are either novel structures created by shuffling dna sequences from diverse origins or the result of a full gene capture in a host other than fungi whose sequence is still not available. the bias found in the gene capturing frequencies of the helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig>  families, as well as the scarce and patchy distribution of some of these genes in fungal phylogeny, gives strength to the hypothesis of an ancient capture in a previous host. the architecture of the non-autonomous copy of the helpo <dig>  family that carries four predicted genes  fits better with a filler dna model in which the captured regions are acquired by the machinery responsible for the non-homologous repair of double-stranded dna breaks  <cit> . a similar integration mechanism was described for viral genomes  <cit> . recently, due to the increasing number of whole genome sequencing projects and bioinformatics analysis tools available, a large body of literature has been reported regarding virus integration into eukaryotic genomes  and their roles in their hosts  <cit> . the presence of virus-related domains within an ltr/gypsy element in a helpo <dig>  copy as well as the occurrence of virus domains in helpo <dig> elements suggests that viruses may have participated in the horizontal transfer of these elements from an anonymous ancestor to basidiomycete fungi. the lack of captured genes in the helpo <dig> family, along with the above mentioned fact, suggests that fungal helitrons are less likely to capture genes and/or gene fragments than plant and animal helitrons. in fact, none of the intact elements showed any evidence of carrying p. ostreatus gene fragments. the captured genes capd and cape of the helpo <dig>  element also contain animal ) and plant ) endogenized viral sequences. some researchers have described the occurrence of footprints resulting from eve integration into host genomes mediated by the retrotransposon enzyme machinery . we have not identified any footprint in the p. ostreatus genome resulting from gene capture. however, the captured gene capf contains a domain  that was recently classified in silico as a putative transposase. it is possible that this transposase, together with the tir elements flanking the capd and capf genes, promoted a chromosome loop in the large copy of helpo <dig> , resulting in the short helpo <dig>  copy. with the exception of helpo <dig> , the helpo <dig> and helpo <dig> families contain putative autonomous elements containing three motifs that define the catalytic core  <cit>  as well as the helicase domain. although fungal rephel helicases are often described to be intronless  <cit> , the rna-seq profiles of the p. ostreatus strain n <dig> revealed the presence of introns in the rephel genes of the helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig>  elements . we did not find any of the previously described domains in the rephel orf such as the replication protein a  found in plant helitrons  <cit>  and occasionally in animals  <cit> , the zinc fingers present in cnidarian, insect, fish, frog, reptile and mammalian helitrons, or the apurinic  and cysteine protease  found in cnidarian, fish and frog helitrons. in contrast, a set of conserved domains from viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes never found before in helitrons  were present in p. ostreatus. the similarity between the rephel proteins in helpo <dig>  and helpo <dig>   indicates their importance for helitron-specific functions. the similarities between capa, capa <dig> and capb  suggest that a functional divergence could have occurred, leading to the maintenance  of their activities that conferred a possible advantage for the host genome. in this sense, the rt-qpcr experiments showed the highest levels of expression of the capa and capa <dig> genes in the pc <dig> and pc <dig> strains and lower expression levels of capb. it should be mentioned that the capa gene carried by the helpo <dig>  elements maps to chromosome vii in a region containing a qtl for earliness and mushroom yield in the dikaryotic strain n <dig> . we are currently studying in dikaryons derived from monokaryotic progeny of n <dig> to find out whether capa transcripts have any influence on earliness and mushroom yield.

phylogenetic reconstruction of rephel helicases
the helitron helicase-like and pif1-like helicase domains are present in the putative autonomous elements of every species and are under selective pressure because they are essential for helitron transposition. thus, these domains retain conserved motifs that can be used to infer the phylogenetic relationships between the helitrons of different organisms. this feature is relevant considering the high variability present within helitron boundaries driven by their ability to capture and reshuffle gene fragments from their hosts. our phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear polyphyletic origin of these domains, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer played a role in shaping the current distribution of helitrons in extant eukaryotic genomes. nevertheless, the direction and order of these events cannot be properly assessed given our current sample size. the differential expansion of rephel helicases in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, along with the presence of viral domains within helitron boundaries gives strength to the hypothesis of horizontal transfer. in fact, viruses have been proven to be vectors of horizontal transfer of other tes between eukaryotic hosts sharing viral pathogens . an important point to emphasize is that, in addition to plant and animal viruses, bacterial and eukaryotic domains were also found to be integrated into pleurotus helitrons. previous genomics analyses have shown that hgt could play a more important role in fungal evolution than originally thought  <cit> . previous results from our laboratory described a bipartite structure similar to that of the a. terreus genome located in a subtelomeric region in p. ostreatus <cit> . this suggests a putative lateral transfer between fungal species. until now, there was evidence of horizontally transferred helitrons in insect viruses  <cit> , but to our knowledge this is the first report dealing with the presence of viral domains inside helitron transposons. the presence of these domains in both of the p. ostreatus helitron families reinforces their putative role in these transfer events, although reconstructing the phylogenetic history of these elements remains difficult. based on our data, we hypothesize a putative scenario in which helitrons could have been repeatedly transferred to the fungal kingdom. this horizontal transfer might have been related to previous viral infections of species belonging to the fungal, plant and animal kingdoms with shared ecological niches.

CONCLUSIONS
p. ostreatus helitrons display structural and enzymatic features similar to those described in other eukaryotic helitrons. our results show that p. ostreatus helitrons do not capture host genes or gene fragments, as is described in plant and animal helitrons. the occurence of genes probably captured from other hosts inside the helitrons boundaries pose the hypothesis that an ancient horizontal transfer mechanism could have taken place. the viral domains in some of these genes and the polyphyletic origin of rephel helicases in the eukaryotic kingdom suggests that virus could have played a role in a putatve lateral transfer of helitrons within the eukaryotic kingdom. however, additional data is necessary to support this statement

the high similarity of some elements present in both pleurotus families, along with the transcriptional activity of the rephel helicases suggests that helitrons are still active in the genome of p. ostreatus. the similarities found between cap genes as well as their expression profiles suggest that a functional divergence could have occurred, leading to the maintenance or suppression of their activities which could confer a possible advantage for either, the helitron or the host genome.
