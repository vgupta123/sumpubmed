BACKGROUND
non-human primates are ideal animal models for many human diseases because of their closely related genetic relationship and numerous biological and behavioral similarities with humans. as an important example, the cynomolgus monkey  is one of the most widely used surrogate animal models for the studies of infectious diseases, organ transplantation, productive biology, and development of new vaccines.

beyond a few sequences of the major histocompatibility complex  classical class i and ii genes and cdnas, at present little information is available about the genomic and gene expression background of the immune system of the cynomolgus monkey. because the cynomolgus monkey serves as an ideal animal model for in vivo hiv and other simian virus infections  <cit> , hiv vaccine trials  <cit> , organ transplantations  <cit> , tuberculosis  <cit> , and stress-related mood disorders in females  <cit> , such knowledge could be critical to basic genetic and clinical studies.

expressed sequence tag  projects provide a rapid and relatively efficient method for gene discovery, especially in organisms that have little information on genomics. another advantage of using cdna sequencing is that gene information is subjected to comparative genetic analysis among closely related species, for example, human and chimpanzee, which could greatly facilitate the evolutionary and genetic human studies, since the old world monkeys share high similarities with humans at the molecular level, especially within coding regions.

therefore, we adopted the est strategy, sequenced and analyzed a collection of  <dig>  ests from an epstein-barr virus   <cit> -transformed b-lymphocyte cdna library of a cynomolgus monkey. many genes that are homologous to their human counterparts corresponding to antigen presentation, recognition and immune response, including mhc class i and ii antigens and many clusters of lymphocyte differentiations, are present in our library, along with many other cdnas. this information would provide us a better understanding of the immune system and genomic background of the cynomolgus monkey at the genomic level. our data has been deposited in the genbank database under accessions dw522370-dw <dig> 

RESULTS
library construction and cdna sequencing
lymphocyte cells were harvested and used to generate a non-normalized, directional cdna library. around  <dig>  clones were randomly picked from the cdna library and subjected to single-pass 5' sequencing using the t <dig> universal primer located at the up-stream of the vector backbone. after trimming low-quality and vector sequences and removing contaminant host sequences, a total number of  <dig>  high-quality ests were obtained with a mean length of  <dig> bp. the length distributions of the ests are shown in figure 1a.

gene-oriented and non-oriented clustering
gene-oriented clustering in est analysis is often applied to the species that have had much sequence information on genes and/or genomes such as human and mouse. although we have little such information of the cynomolgus monkey, the fact that great apes and humans share 98% similarities of their coding regions indicates that it is possible to use human mrnas as references to direct gene-oriented clustering on cynomolgus monkey ests.

therefore, we downloaded all of the human mrna reference sequences from the ncbi refseq database   <cit>  and compared them with our ests using blastn. the ests that aligned to the same human mrna with e-valueâ‰¤1e- <dig> were assembled separately along with the aligned reference sequences using the phrap program  <cit> . at this stage, more strict parameters  of phrap were used to distinguish individual members of possible multi-member gene families. then all assembled unique sequences and ests that did not have significant similarities with human mrnas were assembled together at a low level of stringency . the assembled results were manually examined using consed  <cit> . of the total  <dig>  high-quality ests,  <dig>   were assembled into  <dig>  contigs, while  <dig>   remained as singlets. the distributions of putative open reading frames  of these unigenes  are shown in figure 1b.

because ests are single-pass sequences and are usually error prone, the introduction of reference sequences can produce more reliable results, especially for those cdna libraries containing low-quality sequence data. we also assembled our ests using the original  method and compared the results with that of gene-oriented clustering . it showed that the two methods produced similar results on our ests, indicating the high quality of our data from another point of view.

the use of the reference sequences also enabled us to identify full-length sequences or full orfs of our total  <dig>  unigenes. blast searches against the human mrna reference sequences indicated  <dig>  unigenes matched to the database, among which  <dig>  extended further upstream than the atg  start codon of their homologs, including  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singlets.  <dig>  full insert sequences of cynomolgus monkey cdnas were also downloaded from ncbi and compared with our unigenes. the results yielded additional six full-length sequences, including one contig and five singlets. this relative low percentage of full-length inserts was mainly caused by the fact that the method we used was not optimized to generate a full-insert cdna library. a summary of the alignment results is shown in additional file  <dig> 

our following analysis was based on the results of gene-oriented clustering.

similarities to ncbi nt and nr databases
before the annotation process, the longest putative orfs of all unigenes were determined by dynamically translating them in all six reading frames. those unigenes containing too short orfs  were considered non-informative ones and were subsequently excluded from the following analysis. the remaining  <dig>  orf positive unigenes  were compared with the ncbi nucleotide  database and the ncbi non-redundant protein  database using blastn and blastx, respectively. the searching results indicated that  <dig> unigenes were annotated to mitochondria encoded sequences, containing  <dig>  ests; whereas  <dig> unigenes were annotated to genes coding for ribosomal proteins, containing  <dig> ests. out of the remaining  <dig>  unigenes ,  <dig>   had significant similarities  with sequences in the nt database, containing  <dig>   ests; whereas  <dig>   had significant similarities  with sequences in the nr database, containing  <dig>   ests. table  <dig> shows the most abundantly expressed unigenes  containing at least  <dig> ests and their annotations by blastn and blastx.

the annotation rate of the unigenes by blastx is surprisingly lower than that by blastn . with careful examinations, we found that  <dig> % of the annotated unigenes  by blastn have best matches with mrna and genomic sequences from closely related organisms, such as homo sapiens, pongo pygmaeus, pan troglodytes, and macaca mulatta, which indicated that they could be the mostly expressed genes in these primates due to their numerous biological and genetic similarities.

identification of new transcripts in cynomolgus monkeys and the application in comparative analysis
to identify new genes in cynomolgus monkeys, we compared the  <dig> unigenes that did not have significant matches to the nr database with public available  <dig>  ests of cynomolgus monkeys downloaded from the ncbi dbest database  <cit>  using blastn. we set a cutoff for significant matches as over  <dig> bp coverage of unigenes and 85% identities. the blast results indicated that  <dig> unigenes were matched to the cynomolgus monkey cdnas. then we compared the remaining  <dig> unigenes with human ests in the ncbi dbest database and resulted in additional  <dig> matches. consequently,  <dig> new transcripts containing at least  <dig> bp orfs were identified in total. we aligned these unigenes with the human genome sequences  using blat  <cit> , and found  <dig> unigenes could not match to the human genome with the same criteria indicated above, some of which may represent novel genes specifically expressed in cynomolgus monkeys.

for the  <dig> unigenes that matched to the human genome, we further analyzed their aligned regions by comparing the blat results with the refgene database from ucsc  <cit> . they fell into four categories based on the regions they aligned to : those aligned to intergenic regions , those aligned to introns of known human genes , those overlapped the intron and exon regions with known genes  and those aligned to untranslated regions  , which included  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unignes respectively. it is most likely that class i unigenes represent new genes in the human genome. some of class ii-iv unigenes may represent missing exons or alternatively spliced ones missed in the current human genome annotations, but it is possible that most of the class ii unigenes may represent new genes, since most of which aligned to multiple blocks of the introns.

the comparative results could be very helpful for us to discover more human genes that are currently not present in the human genome annotation reservoir and to revise those incompletely or incorrectly annotated ones by using genes from cynomolgus monkeys as probes and primers. the old world monkeys are highly similar to humans at the molecular level, especially within coding regions. for example, we share over 98% of our genes with apes. by comparing the novel transcripts in cynomolgus monkeys with the human genome and mapping these transcripts to human and chimpanzee chromosomes, we could isolate new genes that may not be present in current gene annotation reservoirs of both species.

another advantage that we can take from genes expressed in cynomolgus monkeys is to improve the overall performance of gene-finding programs by comparative methods. currently, de novo methods can correctly predict only 70% of individual exons and all the coding exons of 20% genes in the human genome, with a large number of false-positives  <cit> . the situation for our dataset is even worse. we compared the  <dig> unigenes with predicted annotations of the human genome performed by genscan, twinscan, geneid, mgcgenes and sgpgene using blast. the results demonstrated that only two unigenes significantly matched to the genscan prediction, one to the geneid and none to the remaining three predictions. with the aids from comparative methods employing similarities among multiple genomic sequences and gene structure conservations, ab initio gene-finding programs could provide high enough specificities and outperform those purely gene prediction methods  <cit> .

gene ontology
because the cdna library was derived from transformed b cells without normalization, it represents a gene expression profile at idealistic environments. by analyzing all unigenes for their functional characteristics using the gene ontology   <cit> , we can overview the gene expression profile of our cdna library. in this ontology, we classified  <dig>   of our unigenes into three functional categories, "biological process", "cellular component" and "molecular process", which were treated as independent attributes. because some genes were classified into more than one subcategory in each of the three major categories, the sum of unigenes in subcategories of every major category might exceed 100%. an overview of the classification is shown in figure  <dig>  the detailed go assignment results are listed in additional file  <dig> 

the largest subcategory found in "biological process" was physiological process, consisting  <dig> % of the unigenes in this category. the second largest subcategory was cellular process, consisting  <dig> % of the unigenes. these abundantly expressed genes indicated that cells were undergoing rapid growth and metabolism, which is consistent with the materials that the cdna library was derived from. other highly abundant subcategories including binding and catalytic activity in "molecular function" also confirmed this conclusion.

the go function categories for our library were further compared with a human b cell  cdna library  downloaded from the ncbi unigene database . the burkitt's lymphoma  is known as a tumor that is infected by ebv and consists of b lymphocytes. total  <dig>  ests from the non-normalized ramos cdna library were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes following our protocol, and  <dig>  unigenes were annotated by blastx, in which  <dig> % unigenes were classified into the go functional categories. as a percentage of classified genes, these two cdna libraries were similarly distributed among the growth dependent groups in both functional categories of molecular function and biological process , such as binding, catalytic, cellular process and physiological process. these subcategories also represented the most abundant ones in both cdna libraries. because b cells in both libraries were featuring rapid metabolism and unlimited cell growth, the equal distributions of these abundantly expressed groups of genes are likely responsible to their tumor-like characteristics.

careful examinations of the genes involved in biological process of these two cdna libraries  revealed that much more genes specifically expressed in the ramos cell line were involved in the process of cell differentiation and non-developmental growth, such as aging, death, morphogenesis and pattern speciation, indicating the non-uniformity development of the ramos cells. in cellular component , most of the unigenes that are ramos-specific were localized in complexes that associated with the formation of dna primary packing unit into higher structures of chromosomes, which indicated that the gene transcription was mediated by selectively packing target regions on chromosomes and more transcription regulators were produced in the ramos cells comparing with our cdna library. therefore, the gene transcriptions in the ramos cells were biased although they were also featuring rapid growth and metabolisms. this is likely to be a result of that the ramos cells were of high-passage and tended to be more morphologically and genetically modified and subjected to apoptosis.

gene families and functional domains assignment
the latest interpro  <cit>  database that represents a collection of protein families, domains and functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can be applied to unknown protein sequences was downloaded from the website of european bioinformatics institute and was compared with our unigenes using blastx with e-valueâ‰¤1e- <dig>  table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> most frequently occurring protein families and functional domains assigned to our cdna library. the largest protein family and domain was assigned to immunoglobulin/mhc, including  <dig> individual unigenes, followed by immunoglobulin-like, cytochrome c heme-binding site and immunoglobulin c-type, including  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes, respectively. these unigenes include proteins that are responsible for the molecular basis of the blood group antigens, consisting at least two light chains: lambda and kappa, and several heavy chains of immunoglobulin, as well as mhc class i and ii antigens. other functional important immunoglobulins including a b cell differentiation antigen cd <dig>  a tap binding like protein and several tnfsf members are also on the list. note that the 1st, 2nd and 4th most abundantly expressed protein families were all immunoglobulin-related, indicating that our cdna library is suitable for the discovery of genes involving in antigen representations and recognitions, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, which could improve our basic understanding of the immune system of the cynomolgus monkey.

mhc-related genes
genetic studies have revealed that mhc associates with more human diseases than any other regions of the human genome, including most of the immune-related disorders, for example, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis , common variable immunodeficiency  and iga deficiency   <cit> . strong associations have been found between many diseases and alleles of classical hla class i and ii genes. the genes within mhc class iii region were also thought to be responsible to susceptibilities to many diseases  <cit> .

the using of the cynomolgus monkey as a surrogate animal model has greatly facilitated the developments of new medicines against human diseases, especially those immune-related ones such as hiv and heart transplantation. but the lacking of knowledge on the mhc region of the cynomolgus monkey has become a bottleneck to basic genetic researches and bio-medical industries.

by constructing the cdna library using b lymphocytes that play important roles in antigen-representation in the immune system, we expected as many as possible genes, especially mhc-related ones. in our cdna library, totally  <dig> unigenes were annotated to mhc antigens using blastx, including four mhc class i genes: mhc_a, b, e and f, eight mhc class ii molecules, and five ones homologous to hla-related genes: hla_b associated transcript  <dig> , complement component 4b , nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b-cells inhibitor-like , valyl-trna synthetase and casein kinase  <dig>  consisting  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ests, respectively.

to evaluate the degree of sequence similarity of the mhc class i and ii genes between cynomolgus monkeys and humans at both nucleotide and protein levels, we analyzed the overlapped sequences with the coding sequences of their corresponding human references. the overall protein similarities were slightly higher than that of nucleotides , indicating low rates of nonsynonymous substitutions. the mhc class i genes showed weak amino acid similarity  to the human reference sequences. we were not surprised with such low sequence identities, since the class i molecules have higher polymorphisms than any others in primates. there is also evidence reported for increased mhc divergence and positive selection among members of mammals  <cit> . totally  <dig> amino acid substitutions were identified at the four mhc class i unigenes by comparing to the human reference sequences .  <dig> of these fell into the transmembrane region  and the cytoplasmic tail ,  <dig> fell into the peptide binding domain  and  <dig> fell into other regions. since exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> are responsible for the peptide binding specificity of each class molecules and usually of high polymorphisms, we speculate at least part the differences and all in other regions between cynomolgus monkeys and humans are results of adaptations to their different environments. mhc class ii genes showed relatively high similarity to their human counterparts. taking two full-length inserts, dra and drb for example, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid substitutions, respectively. all substitutions fell into the leading peptide  and the two extracellular domains ; none fell into the transmembrane domain . because these molecules show no polymorphism in the human genome, the substitutions may represent basic differences in the immune responses between cynomolgus monkeys and humans.

the relative expression abundances of the mhc-related genes as transcripts per million were calculated and compared with those in the ramos cell line and two most related human tissues to b cells: blood and lymph node . since mhc molecules play important roles in concomitant recognition of tumor antigens and are critical for initiation and implementation of the cellular immune response, their abnormal expression levels are often associated with the progression of malignant transformation. low levels of mhc expression lead to low efficiency in antigen presentation and result in boosting of the cell proliferation. in ramos, for example, almost all mhc molecules were down-regulated or even absent . but in our cdna library, we observed that almost all mhc antigens were up-regulated, which was apparently contradictory to the theory. interestingly, the ramos cell line expressed higher levels of hla-a and hla-e than human lymph node, suggesting a possible option for disrupting the antigen-recognition/representation pathways: selectively down-regulating key members instead of quenching all of which in malignantly transformed cells. for example, a functional heterodimer dm, which is composed of two subunits mhc-dma and dmb, is required for mhc class ii/peptide complex formation in antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . although the dma molecule was up-regulated in our cdna library, the absence of the dmb molecule indicated that the proper functions of b cells might be interrupted. however, the situation for the dr heterodimer that plays a central role in antigen representation is different, since the expression levels for both of its subunits dr alpha and beta were up-regulated comparing with that in the human blood and lymph node. interestingly, the mhc class ii antigen dr alpha was also found over-expressed in many types of cancers. although not in common, dr beta did simultaneously express with dr alpha in many cancer types  <cit> , suggesting the level of dr beta transcripts was regulated by a post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanism. in addition, high levels of the invariant chain  that is essential to antigen presentation were observed in our cdna library, indicating that some key member were lacking of mature protein expression, which provides the third optional way to interfere the host immune system.

lymphocyte differentiation antigens, related ligands and receptor genes
lymphocytes can be divided into subsets either by their functions or by surface markers that have been designated as clusters of differentiation , which play various but central roles in b cell activation, development and immunological response regulation. currently, as many as  <dig> cds  <cit>  have been identified, although many of which were not functionally assigned. here we present  <dig> cds identified in our library and their expression abundances , among which cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd79a, cd <dig>  cd179a and cd <dig> are b-cell associated surface markers.

cd <dig> is a b-cell specific molecule that regulate b cell development, activation, differentiation and antigen receptor-mediated mhc class ii antigen processing  <cit> . the membrane complex formed by cd19/cd21/cd <dig> serves as the co-receptor for b-cell receptor  and lowers the thresholds for b cell activation  <cit> . cd <dig>  serves as the ebv receptor of human b lymphocytes  <cit> . a lack of this ebv receptor on transformed b cells was described as a reason for long-term ebv seronegativity  <cit> , which explains the absence of cd <dig> from our cdna library.

cd <dig> is the most abundant one among the surface markers, which contained  <dig> ests , comparing with  <dig>  transcripts per million ests in the human lymph node. cd <dig> plays an important role in the antigen representation by acting as a specific chaperone in mhc class ii assembly and transport  <cit>  and was found coordinately expressed with the mhc class ii antigens in human fetal tissues  <cit> . recent studies have shown that cd <dig> is a membrane receptor for the macrophage migration inhibitory factor , and is responsible for the proliferation by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathway  <cit>  and cytokine expression such as tumor necrosis factor -alpha and interleukin -beta in cancer cells  <cit> . cd <dig>  that functions in cell proliferation and adhesion is another receptor of mif. a tnf super family member  <dig>  and a tnf receptor super family member  <dig>  were expressed in our cdna library, constituting an activation pathway for b cell proliferation along with the mif-cd <dig> plus cd <dig> complex.

after infection by ebv, b cells were immortalized and some tumor-like features would appear. several cd members indicated such state of abnormity. for example, cd <dig> , the second most abundant cd in our cdna library, is a major mediator of malignant cell behavior in the human, and is regulated by several membrane-associated cofactors, including annexin ii  and caveolin- <dig>  <cit> . these surface makers could be used as targets of new medicines against tumor growth. cd179b that only exists in prob and preb cells involving in cell proliferation and differentiation from the prob to preb cell stage was also expressed in our cdna library, indicating the non-differentiation stage of the transformed b cells. strangely, some t-cell specific surface markers also expressed in our cdna library, such as cd <dig> and cd <dig> , indicating possible contaminations from t-cell or other cell types while transformed by ebv.

other immunoglobulin genes
besides mhc genes and many cds, several other immunoglobulin genes were identified in our library, including immunoglobulin alpha heavy chain constant region , immunoglobulin kappa-chain and immunoglobulin lambda-chain. recent studies showed that alleles of a single immunoglobulin c alpha chain were presented in rhesus macaques   <cit> , indicating that similar intra-species heterogeneity of the immunoglobulin genes may exist in cynomolgus monkeys. since these molecules represent the major antibody class functioning as a first line of defenses by neutralizing invading pathogens, their polymorphisms suggest that possible differences among individual animals should be taken account when designing experiment strategies to induce antibodies.

although with the absence of some key molecules in the activation of immune responses to facilitate the virus transformation, the transformed b lymphocytes from the cynomolgus monkey expressed more immunoglobulin and ligand and receptor genes than in human blood and lymph nodes, in numbers as well as in abundances; a b-cell specific proliferation pathway including mif, cd <dig> and cd <dig> was greatly enhanced after transformation. these results indicated that this cdna library represents an ideal model to improve our understanding of mechanisms of antigen representations and immune responses of cynomolgus monkeys. the differentially expressed genes between our cdna library and normal b cells of cynomolgus monkeys, if available, should be in great interests, because of their possible key functions corresponding to the immune response and malignant cell growth. yet one of the greatest challenges is that we do not know which one of the differentially expressed genes is the reason of the transformation and which one is just the result. much more researches are needed to be done until we get the answer.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a cdna library from lymphocytes of the cynomolgus monkey and sequenced about  <dig>  randomly picked clones. approximately all  orf positive unique transcripts  shared significant similarities with the ncbi nt database, but only  <dig> % of these transcripts shared significant similarities with the ncbi nr database using blast-based tools. further analysis revealed  <dig> new transcripts in cynomolgus monkeys; in which  <dig> did not share significant similarities with any human ests. such sequence information was used in comparative analysis to identify possible novel genes in the human genome.

the cynomolgus monkey is one of the most widely used surrogate animal models for an increasing number of human diseases and vaccines, such as hiv and heart transplantation. but the lacking of background information at the genomic level especially in the immune system has greatly hinged our progress. our cdna library, which was derived from the ebv-transformed b lymphocytes of the cynomolgus monkey, could identify as many as possible immune-related genes and reveal the gene expression profile. since many human diseases are associated with the mhc region and deficiencies of immune system, such knowledge is of great interest to researchers and industries that use cynomolgus monkeys as experimental models.
