BACKGROUND
melon  is an important horticultural crop grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions worldwide. more than  <dig> million tonnes of fruit were produced in  <dig>   <dig> % in asia,  <dig> % in europe,  <dig> % in america and  <dig> % in africa  <cit> . melon belongs to the cucurbitaceae family, which comprises  <dig> genera and ~ <dig> species, including other fruit crops such as watermelon  matsum & nakai), cucumber , squash and pumpkin . genetically, melon is a diploid species  with an estimated genome size of  <dig> mb  <cit> . transgenic melons, first produced in  <dig>  can now be generated in a range of recalcitrant cultivars  <cit> . melon fruits are morphologically and biochemically diverse, which makes them particularly suitable for research into the flavor and texture changes that occur during ripening  <cit> .

despite its economic importance, there are few genomic resources for melon. as of january  <dig>   <dig>  high-quality expressed sequence tags  and  <dig>  unigenes were available in public databases  <cit> , which is low when compared to the  <dig>  ests available for tomato  and the  <dig> , <dig> ests available for rice   <cit> . more recent efforts to increase the availability of genetic and genomic resources for melon  <cit>  have included the construction of bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries  <cit> , the development of oligo-based microarrays  <cit> , the production of tilling and ecotilling platforms  <cit>  and the development of a collection of near isogenic lines   <cit> . however, the integration of genetic and physical maps is a necessary first step towards sequencing the melon genome, identifying relevant genes using these to discover how economically important aspects of fruit development are controlled  <cit> .

over the last  <dig> years, several melon genetic maps have been constructed primarily using randomly amplified polymorphic dnas , restriction fragment length polymorphisms , amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and simple sequence repeats   <cit> . these maps have helped to pinpoint the loci of some important agronomic traits  <cit> , but they are sparsely populated and the different markers make them difficult to compare. to address this issue, a genetic map has recently been constructed by merging several of those previous genetic maps  <cit> . in addition, a melon physical map representing  <dig>  Ã— melon genomic equivalents has recently been constructed using both a bac library and a genetic map previously developed in our laboratory  <cit> . the physical and genetic maps have been integrated by anchoring  <dig> genetic markers to the physical map, allowing contigs representing 12% of the melon genome to be anchored to known genetic loci.

it is important to obtain an accurate, representative sample of the genome ahead of full genome sequencing and annotation, and the end-sequencing of large numbers of bac clones is an efficient strategy to achieve this goal. bac-end sequences  generate accurate but inexpensive genome samples that give a first impression of properties such as gc content, the distribution of microsatellites and transposable elements, and the amount of coding dna  <cit> . however, most bac libraries are constructed by digesting dna with one or more restriction endonucleases, which introduces a partial bias in coverage because the target sites are distributed in a non-random manner  <cit> . we therefore sequenced bac-ends representing  <dig>  clones, half from a previously described bac library generated using restriction endonucleases, but the remainder from a freshly-prepared random shear bac library to eliminate the possibility of bias. we obtained  <dig>  high-quality bes, which were analyzed for gc content, microsatellites, repeat elements and coding regions. a total of  <dig>  paired bes were mapped independently onto six sequenced genomes from other dicotyledonous plant species to identify regions of microsynteny.

RESULTS
bac libraries
two bac libraries from the double-haploid melon line pit <dig> were used for bac-end sequencing . a bamhi bac library  had previously been constructed in our laboratory with an average insert size of  <dig> kb, representing  <dig>  genome equivalents of the melon haploid genome   <cit> . in order to increase the genome coverage and reduce the bias associated with bac libraries constructed using non-random dna fragments, a second bac library  was prepared using randomly-sheared melon genomic dna. with  <dig>  bac clones and an average insert size of  <dig> kb, this library represents  <dig>  genomic equivalents. when combined, the two libraries represent ~ <dig> genomic equivalents.

fingerprinting of clones from the bcm library allowed the construction of a melon physical map  <cit> . the analysis of the structure of the bac contigs revealed a high proportion of 'stacked' contigs, that is, contigs containing regions of depth that exceeded by far the estimated coverage of the library used ; in fact, most of the contigs contained bacs sharing one border, a feature most probably explained by the unequal use of bamhi restriction sites during library construction. these data strongly suggest that the bcm library could be heavily affected by the non-randomness currently associated to all libraries constructed by one-enzyme restriction of genomic dna. on the contrary, being a random shear library, rcm should represent more randomly the melon genome, although some bias produced by unequal dna fragmentation cannot be ruled out.

bac end sequencing
we sequenced the ends of  <dig>  bcm bacs and  <dig>  rcm bacs, generating  <dig>  and  <dig>  high-quality bes, respectively . together, this amounted to  <dig>  high-quality bes, of which  <dig> % were paired-bes. the average read length was  <dig> bp, representing  <dig>  mb of genomic dna in total or  <dig> % of the genome . the bes have been deposited in the genbank databases under the accession numbers hn291986-hn <dig> 

1sequences obtained by assembly of bcm-bes, rcm-bes or contigs and singletons from the bcm and rcm assemblies

as any analysis based on a highly redundant set of bes would produce unaccurate genomic information, the bcm and rcm bes were assembled independently to reduce sequence redundancy. in order to avoid as much as possible the incorrect assembly of highly repetitive genomic regions, the assembly was performed using rather strict constraints . the bcm assembly produced  <dig>  contigs with a total length of  <dig>  mb, as well as  <dig>  singletons , whereas the rcm assembly produced  <dig>  contigs  as well as  <dig>  singletons . although the numbers of high-quality bes, paired-bes and the average read length were similar for both libraries, only 45% of the bcm bes remained as singletons after assembly, compared to 76% of the rcm bes. furthermore, the average length of contigs comprising two bes was  <dig> bp for the bcm assembly and  <dig> bp for the rcm assembly. these data support the conclusion that the rcm bes are more uniformly distributed across the melon genome than those from the bcm library, as anticipated from the construction methods. the non-random distribution of restriction endonuclease target sites and cytosine methylation targets has promoted research into a number of alternative library construction methods, including the random shearing approach used here and the use of methylation-sensitive partial restriction digests  <cit> .

a final combined set of non-redundant, high-quality bes  was produced after the cross-assembly of the bcm and rcm contigs and singletons. this contained  <dig>  sequences of average length  <dig> bp and total length  <dig>  mb, grouped in  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  non-assembled bes . only  <dig>  contigs were longer than the maximum bes length . the average gc content was  <dig> %, similar to previous values from sequenced melon bac clones  <cit> .

significantly, the total length of the bcm-rcm assembly was just  <dig> kb shorter, and contained only  <dig>  less sequences, than the global length of the bcm and rcm assemblies on the whole . thus, almost no redundancy seems to exist between bes from the bcm library and those from the rcm library, strongly suggesting that incorrect assembly of bes from duplicate or repetitive genomic regions should not represent a significant reason behind the high redundancy detected when assembling bcm and rcm bes; otherwise, similar levels of redundancy would had been detected when cross-assembling the bcm and rcm contigs and singletons, contrary to our results.

simple sequence repeats
the bcm-rcm sequences were screened for ssrs, resulting in the identification of  <dig>  microsatellites at least  <dig> nt in length  or containing at least four tandem repeat units . ssrs accounted for  <dig>  bp  of the total bcm-rcm sequence, which is equivalent to one microsatellite every  <dig>  kb . mononucleotide tandem repeats were the most abundant, accounting for  <dig> % of all microsatellites, followed by trinucleotides  and dinucleotides . the poly/poly microsatellite was the most common mononucleotide repeat  and the poly microsatellite was the most common dinucleotide repeat . these data confirm previous results from the analysis of two melon bac clones  <cit>  although dinucleotide repeats appear to be less abundant in melon than in many other plants, e.g. apple, tomato, potato, clementine, papaya and banana  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>   microsatellites were found to be >  <dig> nucleotides in length  making them good candidates for hypervariable, polymorphic markers. the longest microsatellites repeat units of 1- <dig> nucleotides were a 57-bp poly sequence, a 102-bp poly repeat, a 465-bp poly repeat and a 172-bp poly repeat. the most abundant ssrs for each repeat unit category were generally at-rich, although exceptionally the most abundant pentanucleotide repeat was agccg/cggct .

the above analysis was also carried out individually on the bcm and rcm assemblies. when values in table  <dig> were normalized relative to the total sequence length of each assembly, rcm was found to contain  <dig>  times more ssrs than bcm, with some specific cases  showing a marked increase in the microsatellite content of rcm relative to bcm . significantly, the number of ssrs longer than  <dig> nt was found to be four times higher in rcm than in bcm while the number of ssrs shorter than  <dig> nt was only  <dig>  times greater in rcm than in bcm. we therefore conclude that the rcm library represents genomic regions with a higher content and different distribution of microsatellites than those covered by the bcm library.

we validated these results by searching for microsatellites in the melon unigene collection  at icugi  <cit>  using identical search parameters. a total of  <dig>  ssrs was found among  <dig>  unigenes spanning  <dig>  mb of the melon transcriptome. these microsatellites represent  <dig>  bp, or  <dig> % of the total combined unigene sequence, a density of one ssr every  <dig>  kb. although these figures are equivalent to those obtained using the bcm-rcm assembly, the relative abundance of 1- <dig> nucleotide repeat microsatellites was quite different, with trinucleotide repeats the most abundant class , followed by mononucleotide  and dinucleotide  repeats. ssr frequency and type are known to differ between coding dna, intron dna and intergenic dna  <cit> , and it has previously been shown that trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant ssrs in plant coding regions  <cit> .

repetitive elements
the bcm-rcm assembly was compared with the plant repeat databases at http://plantrepeats.plantbiology.msu.edu/ and also screened using repeatmasker software to locate transposable elements, rrnas and telomere- and centromere-related sequences. a total of  <dig>  sequences showed homology with plant repeat elements  of which  <dig> % were transposable elements  . class i transposons  were the most abundant, accounting for  <dig> % of tes. sequences homologous to retrotransposons were classified as ltr-containing ty1-copia  and ty3-gypsy , lines  and other unclassified elements . the next most abundant repeats were class ii transposons, 51% of which were classified as en-spm elements. these figures are similar to those obtained from cucumber, where retrotransposons accounted for 81% of all tes, the ty1/ty <dig> ratio is  <dig> , and en-spm elements accounted for 54% of all classified dna transposons  <cit> . other plant repeat elements included twelve putative rolling-circle transposons,  <dig> rdna sequences and three putative telomere-related sequences.

telomere-related
total no. of
the bcm and rcm assemblies were searched independently for plant repeat sequences and the class i/class ii ratio was found to be the same from both sources. however, some differences were detected regarding the relative abundance of specific transposon subfamilies. while en/spm elements were the most abundant class ii transposons in the rcm assembly, accounting for 64% of all dna transposons and followed by mudr elements , en/spm transposons accounted for only 37% of tes in the bcm assembly, with mudrs representing 43% of dna transposons. also, the ty1/ty <dig> ratios were  <dig> and  <dig>  in the bcm and rcm assemblies, respectively. significantly, whereas the rcm assembly contained  <dig> putative rdna sequences, only  <dig> were found in the bcm assembly. the genes for the 18s,  <dig> s and 25s ribosomal rnas are present in tandem arrays containing up to  <dig>  repeats in a chromosome structure known as the nucleolar organizer region  <cit> . genomic regions containing highly repetitive sequences arranged in tandem repeats are often underrepresented in genomic libraries constructed using one restriction endonuclease. therefore, our data suggest that the melon rcm library represents genomic regions not covered or poorly represented by the bcm library.

coding regions
bcm-rcm non-redundant and masked sequences were tested against the  <dig>  sequences from the melon unigene database v <dig>  <cit>  using the blastn algorithm . because this approach compares short fragments of genomic dna against ests, the use of stringent match conditions would fail to detect most bes containing intron-exon boundaries, whereas less stringent conditions would increase the number of false positives. as a compromise, a double cut-off approach was used with a low-stringency e value of 10- <dig> and a high-stringency value of 10- <dig>  the low-stringency search identified  <dig>  matching sequences, with  <dig>  showing > 95% identity to melon unigenes. the remaining unmatched sequences were then used to search other cucurbit unigene databases   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  additional sequences showed homology to those cucurbit unigene sets. finally, sequences that failed to match any cucurbit est databases were used to search all non-cucurbit plant est assembly databases at http://www.plantgdb.org and  <dig> additional hits were found. in all,  <dig>   of the analyzed sequences were shown to contain putative regions of coding dna. the high-stringency search identified  <dig>  hits or  <dig> % of all tested sequences. these results suggest that between 20% and 35% of the melon genome consists of coding dna.

comparative mapping of melon bes onto other plant genomes
the analysis of two regions of the melon genome  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb in length has previously revealed significant degrees of microsynteny between melon and arabidopsis thaliana, poplar  and medicago truncatula  <cit> . syntenic relationships facilitate the investigation of genome evolution and dynamics, comparative genomics and phylogeny  <cit> , as well as allowing agronomically important genes to be identified and cloned  <cit> . for example, the melon nsv locus, which confers resistance to melon necrotic spot virus, was cloned by exploiting synteny  <cit> .

in order to identify regions of synteny between the melon genome and other sequenced plant genomes, all  <dig>  high quality bes were masked for repeats and used to search the genome sequences available in the phytozome v <dig>  database http://www.phytozome.net. six dicotyledonous species were chosen for the analysis: a. thaliana, cucumber, soybean , m. truncatula, poplar and grapevine . only scaffolds >  <dig> kb in length were used for comparative mapping in cucumber because the contiguity of the cucumber genome sequence is currently low. the cucumber scaffolds represent  <dig> mb or  <dig> % of the sequence assembly deposited in the phytozome database and 61% of the cucumber genome  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  6-10% of melon bes matched non-curcubit genomes , and 65% of melon bes matched the cucumber genome . a. thaliana showed the lowest number of hits whereas grapevine, poplar and soybean showed similar levels. because only ~70% of the complete cucumber genome was used, we estimate that more than 90% of all melon bes would show significant homology to the whole cucumber genome sequence if available.

synteny between the melon genome and other plants was characterized by searching the bcm-rcm sequence for paired bes that 1) mapped to the same chromosome, 2) within a 50- <dig> kb region and 3) were oriented correctly with respect to each other. according to these criteria,  <dig> - <dig> % of all paired bes were deemed potentially collinear with the other plant genomes . again, a. thaliana showed the lowest number of hits , followed by m. truncatula , grapevine , soybean  and poplar . the higher degree of synteny between melon and poplar compared to melon and m. truncatula, despite the cucurbitales being considered phylogenetically closer to fabales than to malphigiales, is consistent with previous results from the analysis of two independent melon regions  <cit> . in cucumber,  <dig>  paired bes  fulfilled the three syntenic conditions listed above. however, the available cucumber genomic sequence is not yet assembled into chromosomes, and the scaffolds >  <dig> kb are represented by only ~ <dig> sequences. therefore, a significant number of true collinear paired bes could not be detected due to paired bes mapping into different but adjacent cucumber scaffolds, and so the number of paired bes potentially collinear with the cucumber genome is probably much higher than the above value.

when the requirement for correct orientation was omitted to consider collinear regions that may have suffered localized inversions, there was an increase of 20-56% in the number of paired bes hits. interestingly, when considering the total number of paired bes that map on the same chromosome, the percentage of paired bes mapping within 50- <dig> kb is > 40% in all plants except a. thaliana and m. truncatula. for example, 55% of all paired bes mapping on the same poplar chromosome do so within the prescribed distance. as poplar chromosomes are on average  <dig> mb in length, these data show that the mapping loci are not randomly distributed in the poplar genome, which supports our conclusion that our hits reflect true syntenic relationships.

due to the high synteny degree detected between the melon and cucumber genomes, the latter was chosen for an additional synteny analysis performed using the recently published melon physical map of fingerprinted bacs from the bcm library  <cit> . the cucumber genome assembly together with all bcm bes were tested against the physical map using the draft sequence functions of the fpc software as described in the methods section. all  <dig> physical contigs built from at least  <dig> bac clones were analyzed and  <dig> % were found to contain four of more bes mapping in a contiguous cucumber region greater than  <dig> kb. a detailed list of the positive melon fcp contigs, cucumber contigs and lengths of the detected synteny regions can be found in the additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  in addition, the symap software package, whose role is to compute and display synteny blocks between physical maps and genome sequences from different species  <cit> , was used to obtain graphical representations of the collinear regions between melon and cucumber. figure  <dig> shows an example of such a synteny region.

previous results have shown that the network of microsynteny found between melon and the sequenced genomes of a. thaliana, poplar and m. truncatula results from the polyploid structure of those genomes, which reflect ancient whole genome duplications  <cit> . we therefore determined the number of times each bes pair generated hits on the same chromosome . in poplar, soybean, grapevine and m. truncatula, each bes pair fulfilling the first of the syntenic conditions listed above mapped twice, on average, onto the subject genome. this fell to  <dig>  in a. thaliana but climbed to  <dig>  in cucumber. these figures seem to indicate a genome duplication event in a common ancestor of melon and cucumber as well as another, more ancient event affecting a common ancestor of all the dicotyledonous species we analyzed. we also noted that ~83% of bes pairs mapping to more than one locus mapped to different chromosomes, suggesting a major role of whole-genome/chromosomal duplications rather than intrachromosomal segmental duplications as an explanation for the large number of multiple mapping paired-bes.

the analysis of  <dig> melon genetic markers suggested that cucumber chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are collinear with melon chromosomes 2/ <dig>  3/ <dig>  4/ <dig>  9/ <dig>  and 8/ <dig>  respectively  <cit> . this suggests that each cucumber chromosome originated from the fusion of two ancestral chromosomes after cucurbit speciation. several interchromosomal and intrachromosomal rearrangements have also been described  <cit> . given the high number of paired melon bes showing collinearity with the cucumber genome, the data presented here will provide further insight into the dynamic evolution of these genomes, particularly once the current low contiguity of the cucumber genome sequence has been addressed.

CONCLUSIONS
we have sequenced bac-ends from  <dig>  clones, half from an existing bac library produced using restriction endonucleases and the remainder from a newly constructed random shear bac library. the resulting sequences confirmed that the random shear library is more representative of the melon genome than the restriction library, with less bias against repetitive dna and fewer gaps. the sequences covered ~ <dig> % of the melon genome, providing data on the abundance and distribution of microsatellites, tes and coding dna, and synteny between melon paired-bes and six other dicotyledonous plant genomes. in particular, we observed sequence conservation and synteny between the melon and cucumber genomes. these results showed that useful comparative genomic information can be derived using a large scale bac-end sequencing approach by anchoring a small proportion of the melon genome to other sequenced genomes.
