BACKGROUND
mitochondrial myopathy and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy are terms that define a group of neurological disorders characterized by defective oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . multiple organs may be affected including skeletal muscle, liver and central nervous system. the genetics and pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders are complex because of the interaction of the mtdna and nuclear genomes. the mtdna contains  <dig> genes encoding  <dig> mitochondrial proteins. the remaining of the over  <dig> predicted mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome  <cit> . the majority of these nuclear genes are unknown  is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous subgroup of mitochondrial diseases of nuclear origin which is characterised by severe reduction of mtdna content in specific tissues, mainly muscle, liver and brain to date  <dig> nuclear genes have been identified as causing mds which encode proteins directly involved in the maintenance of the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools  such as thymidine kinase  <dig> , deoxyguanosine kinase , p <dig> dependent ribonucleotide reductase subunit  <dig>  and thymidine phosphorylase , or in mtdna replication such as mtdna polymerase γ  and twinkle . the role of the other three mds causative gene products , and the α and β subunits of succinate-coa ligase  in mtdna maintenance is less clear  <cit> .

clinically, mds are divided into myopathic, hepatocerebellar or encephalomyopathic, depending on which tissues are mainly affected at the onset of the symptoms. the myopathic form is most frequently associated with mutations in the tk <dig>  sucla <dig> and rrm2b genes. thymidine kinase  <dig> is responsible for the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleosides  inside the mitochondria as part of the salvage pathway. in contrast, thymidine kinase  <dig>  participates in the de novo deoxythymidine monophosphate  synthesis pathway in the cytoplasm which is then imported into mitochondria. in most reported cases mutations in tk <dig> result in almost complete absence of enzyme activity and as a consequence in a very severe reduction in mtdna content  which leads to combined respiratory chain complexes deficiency. myopathic mds due to tk <dig> defects is characterised by neonatal or early onset of hypotonia which progresses rapidly into a severe myopathy and infantile death because of respiratory failure although there are reports of patients which survive longer  <cit> . electromyography shows myopathic signs; creatine kinase levels  are markedly elevated and lactate is moderately high. in addition to muscle symptoms patients may also have cns involvement  <cit> . at the pathological level, muscle biopsies frequently show dystrophic changes with loss of muscle fibres, proliferation of connective and adipose tissues, ragged red fibers with mitochondria proliferation and profound cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and increased intracellular lipid content  <cit> . to date, more than  <dig> missense mutations, deletions and insertions have been reported in the tk <dig> gene. some of them have been reported in more than one non-related families  <cit> .

two mouse models of tk <dig> defects have been generated. tk <dig> knocked-out mice  <cit>  suffer growth retardation and hypothermia and die within 2–4 weeks of life. they show progressive depletion of mtdna in skeletal muscle, heart and liver. the morphology of skeletal muscle seems unaffected whereas cardiac muscle is disorganised and contains abnormally structured mitochondria. the authors conclude that tk <dig> is necessary for deoxythymidine triphosphate  synthesis in non-replicating cells, whereas fast-replicating cells rely more heavily on the de novo synthesis pathway. thus, as tissues mature, mtdna replication is increasingly affected and mtdna depletion worsens. detailed analysis of the neurological features of these mice revealed an ataxic phenotype with progressive loss of mtdna content, respiratory chain activity and protein content of mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits in brain tissue, which is accompanied by selective loss of neuronal types  <cit> . the tk <dig> knock-in mice bear the human h126n missense mutation and also showed growth retardation and had a generalized weakness, tremor and impaired gait  <cit> . tk <dig> activity was severely reduced in all tissues tested  confirming that the mutation severely disrupts tk <dig> function. brain and spinal cord showed the most prominent mtdna depletion followed by skeletal muscle, heart and kidney whereas in contrast to the ko model, liver mtdna content was normal. activities of the respiratory chain enzymes were selectively reduced in brain and spinal cord whereas they were normal in skeletal muscle. histological analysis of skeletal muscle was unremarkable. in contrast, the equivalent homozygous mutation in humans resulted in severe myopathy  <cit> . thus, neither of the two mouse models replicates the severe muscle phenotype and pathology seen in humans.

how the muscle cell responds to mtdna depletion, impaired oxidative phosphorylation and severe loss of energy production and how these mechanisms differ between mds and other mitochondrial myopathies is not well understood. a patient was described which survived into adulthood. analysis of his two consecutive muscle biopsies revealed an increase in mtdna content with time which paradoxically was accompanied by a decrease in complex iv activity and severe muscle mass and fibre loss  <cit> . these findings suggest that there may have been a selective loss of the most affected fibres and that a compensatory mechanism may be acting in these patients to maintain mtdna levels in surviving muscle fibres. identification of such compensatory pathways would be of great importance to devise potential therapies.

in order to address some of these questions we undertook global gene expression analysis of muscle biopsies from mds patients with mutations in tk <dig> and compared it with that of patients with mtdna large deletions and aged matched normal muscle. we found a large number of genes whose expression was significantly changed which represent the molecular signature of tk <dig> deficient human muscle. our data show that the activation of p <dig> signalling pathway is relevant to the pathogenesis of tk <dig> defects and show that energy production via glucose and glycogen metabolism are significantly impaired at the transcriptional level. in contrast, genes known to be part of the starvation response mechanism were increased. we describe the over-expression of growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  in muscle and serum and its potential use as a novel biomarker of mitochondrial disease.

RESULTS

in the cdna microarray we included  <dig> unrelated patients with mds and mutations in tk <dig> ,  <dig> patients with large mtdna deletions as disease control group  and  <dig> aged-matched healthy individuals  . whole genome was analysed using agilent human 8 × 60k arrays. standard array quality controls were performed showing satisfactory results. unsupervised bi-clustering analysis considering the agilent oligonucleotides with the largest variations across the whole experiment showed an appropriate segregation of the different samples. data has been deposited at the national centre for biotechnology information gene expression omnibus  database as geo series accession number gse <dig>

amongst the top under-expressed genes we found some genes encoding skeletal muscle components characteristic of type ii muscle fibres  such as sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase  <dig> , myosin-light chain kinase  <dig> , actinin-type  <dig>  and aquaporin- <dig> . these changes indicate a selective loss of type ii fibres. in fact, type  <dig> predominance has been reported in some of the patients included in our microarray  <cit> .

fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  <dig>  is the gene encoding the muscle specific enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of fructose- <dig>  6-bisphosphatase into fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate during gluconeogenesis. as we will see later we found several other genes involved in glucose and glycogen metabolism amongst the significantly under-expressed genes including glycogen phosphorylase .

ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein  <dig> is a member of the muscle ankyrin repeat protein family . the protein is localized to the nucleus, functioning as a transcriptional regulator. expression of this protein is induced during recovery following starvation  <cit> .

glutamate-ammonia ligase  is responsible for the synthesis of glutamine. glul is expressed throughout the body and plays an important role in controlling body ph and removing ammonia from the circulation  <cit> .

the arrdc <dig> protein belongs to a family of proteins some of which are involved in ubiquitination by the e <dig> nedd <dig> ligase  <cit> . trim <dig> encodes for the muscle specific e <dig> ubiquitin ligase murf <dig> which is involved in regulating skeletal muscle fibre atrophy. we and others have found decreased trim <dig> rna expression in chronic atrophy and in diseased muscle  <cit> .

regarding the top over-expressed genes, growth and differentiation factor  <dig>  encodes a cytokine which has been involved in a variety of processes including reduced risk of miscarriage and myocardial infarction  <cit> . tribbles-homolog  <dig>  is a pseudokinase which negatively regulates nf-κb signalling and sensitizes cells to tnf and trail induced apoptosis. in addition, expression of trib <dig> increases during periods of reduced nutrient supply to induce lipolysis  <cit> .

myh <dig>  myh <dig> and tnnt <dig> encode for the neonatal, embryonic myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponin  <dig> respectively and are markers of muscle fibre regeneration.

col19a <dig> encodes for the alpha- <dig> chain of collagen xix which we have found similarly over-expressed in various dystrophies including duchenne muscular dystrophy  and probably reflects the amount of fibrosis observed in the muscle biopsies of these patients  <cit> .


skeletal muscle expression

to ascertain which differentially expressed genes are known to be expressed in skeletal muscle we filtered the gene dataset  using ingenuity pathways -knowledge base . among the  <dig> under-expressed genes,  <dig> passed this filter and  <dig> among the  <dig> over-expressed genes . using this filter we lost  <dig> genes in the top  <dig> over-expressed genes . all the top  <dig> under-expressed genes in the whole set of genes passed the ipa filter. thus, there was very good agreement between the results of the analysis for the whole set of genes and for the skeletal muscle filtered one. however, ipa may discard some genes with low basal expression levels in skeletal muscle, genes that are tightly developmentally regulated or have not been described as expressed in skeletal muscle. for this reason we decided to focus on the whole set of genes in order to avoid loosing valuable data.


gene ontology

in order to obtain gene ontology enrichment analysis, the lists of differentially over and underexpressed genes  were considered in the tool david  <cit> . those go_bp terms  with a%fdr <  <dig> were considered as significantly enriched and selected for further analysis . for simplicity, we grouped the various go terms in broader go_bp categories as shown in figure  <dig> . the go_bp classes corresponding to the under-expressed genes  were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation, nucleotide metabolism and muscle contraction whereas over-expressed genes were mainly associated with inflammation, apoptosis, aminoacid and nitrogen compound metabolism, organic acid synthesis, adhesion, ion homeostasis, muscle system and oxygen transport .

the inflammation gene class included components of the complement cascade such as c <dig> , major histocompatibility complex class i such as hla-b , major histocompatibility complex class ii such as hla-dpa <dig> , interleukins  and interferon-induced genes . we confirmed the induction of an immune response by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against hla antigen  and against inflammatory cell markers in muscle biopsies from patients with tk <dig> mutations , a patient with mds due to sucla <dig> mutations  and in disease controls . in tk <dig> deficient muscle hla i was expressed in the sarcolemma and/or cytoplasm of some muscle fibres and in inflammatory cells. hla i was detected on the sarcolemma of most fibres and in inflammatory cells in sucla <dig> deficient muscle. in muscle from patients with large mtdna deletions, hla i was expressed on isolated muscle fibres located near ragged red fibres . in all cases, the inflammatory infiltrate was mainly composed of macrophages which express cd <dig> .

within the enriched ontologies related to the regulation of cell death by apoptosis and the cell cycle we found numerous genes that were induced at comparable levels suggesting their coordinated regulation. they include genes that encode molecules that transmit apoptotic signals from the cell surface  and others that are activated via intracellular signals such as dna damage via the p <dig> pathway  and genes that encode key regulators of the cell cycle such as p <dig> or cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor  <dig>  and growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible alpha .

one of the most over-expressed genes in tk <dig> deficient muscle corresponds to trib <dig>  which encodes a putative kinase which is induced by nfκb and which in turn inhibits the activity of the latter. trib <dig> sensitizes cells to apoptosis induced by trail and tnf and it has been shown to interact with akt <dig> inhibiting its pro-survival effect.

several of the apoptotic signals above mentioned converge in the mitochondria and lead to the release of cytochrome c and the activation of apaf- <dig> and caspase- <dig>  we investigated caspase- <dig> activation at the protein level by immunofluorescence in the muscle biopsies of  <dig> patients with tk <dig> mutations  and other mitochondrial encephalomyopathies . as a positive control we stained frozen sections from wilms tumor, which is a form of paediatric nephroblastoma which shows high numbers of apoptotic cells. we observed very strong immunoreactivity against active caspase- <dig> in the cytoplasm of numerous fibres in tk <dig> deficient muscle as well as in rrf in p <dig> and p <dig> .

caspase- <dig> activation leads to dna fragmentation so we performed the tunel assay in muscle biopsies from patients with tk <dig> mutations , a patient with sucla <dig> mutations  and patients with confirmed mitochondrial encephalomyopathy . we observed tunel positivity in myonuclei and apoptotic bodies in tk <dig> deficient muscle as well as in some of the myonuclei of the rrf in a patient with a melas phenotype  .

several genes encoding enzymes involved in aminoacid, urea cycle and lipid metabolism were over-expressed in response to tk <dig> deficiency. noteworthy is the induction of shmt <dig>  encoding serine hydroxymethyltransferase- <dig> that catalyses the conversion of serine and tetrahydrofolate  to glycine and methylene thf. more importantly in the context of mtdna homeostasis, shmt <dig> is one of the three key enzymes  and dihydrofolate reductase  involved in de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway in mitochondria  <cit> . thus, the upregulation of this pathway is likely to represent a mechanism to compensate for the lack of dtmp as a result of the severely reduced tk <dig> activity in these patients. tyms gene expression was also increased by  <dig>  fold but dhfr was not significantly changed.

the ass <dig> gene  encodes argininosuccinate synthetase- <dig>  a cytosolic urea cycle enzyme expressed in most tissues. the enzyme is involved in the synthesis of arginine and catalyses that condensation of citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate using atp. it is a key enzyme because it links the krebs cycle with the urea cycle and pyrimidine synthetic pathway. mutations in ass <dig> cause citrullinemia type i  <cit> . its induction suggests an increase in the rate of ammonia detoxification and aminoacid degradation as a source of energy. within this category we also found asns  encoding asparagine synthethase and psat <dig>  encoding phosphoserine aminotransferase that are enzymes of the asparagine and serine biosynthetic pathways respectively.

there was an important induction of the hmgcs <dig> gene  which encodes hmg-coa synthase, as a key enzyme in ketogenesis which is a pathway to derive energy from fatty acids when blood glucose levels are low or the tca cycle is impaired. hmgcs <dig> has been shown to be expressed in skeletal muscle  <cit>  although ketogenesis only occurs in liver cells. thus, the significance of hmgcs <dig> over-expression is unclear unless it is related to another yet unknown function. trib <dig>  and fgf- <dig>  are genes involved in the regulation of lipolysis upon nutrient deprivation  <cit> .

within the enriched go_bps related to glucose and glycogen metabolism we found several genes encoding for key enzymes indicating an important and coordinated attenuation of those pathways at least at the gene expression level. these included lactate dehydrogenase a  and phosphofructokinase-fructose-biphosphatase - <dig> and - <dig> . the two latter are enzymes that regulate the levels of fructose- <dig> -biphosphate which is a potent stimulator of glycolysis and an inhibitor of gluconeogenesis. thus, the activity of these enzymes regulates glucose metabolism. pfkfb <dig> is ubiquitously expressed whereas pfkfb <dig> is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle and central nervous system. it is however worth bearing in mind that gluconeogenesis takes places mainly in liver whereas it is very little active in skeletal muscle and therefore the biochemical significance of some of the observed changes at mrna level remain unclear. phka <dig>  and phkg <dig>  encode two out of the  <dig> subunits of the phosphorylase b kinase enzyme which together with glycogen phosphorylase  regulates the degradation of glycogen to release glucose molecules.

amongst the under-expressed components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and related genes we found cytochrome b , mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c subunit ii  and aarf domain containing kinase  <dig>  which is involved in the synthesis of coenzyme q.

regarding genes involved in nucleotide metabolism that were under-expressed it is worth mentioning guanosine monophosphate reductase  which catalyses the irreversible nadph-dependent reductive deamination of guanosine monophosphate  to inosine monophosphate  which is the precursor of both guanine  and adenine  nucleotides. thus, it plays an important role in maintaining the intracellular balance of purine nucleotides.

within the calcium/ion transport gene category of under-expressed genes we found calcium channels such as plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> , calcium channel, voltage-dependent, l type, alpha 1s subunit, , potassium channels such as atp-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel  <dig>  and sodium channels including sodium channel voltage gated type  <dig>  beta subunit  which is the channel that serves to transmit membrane action potentials in the cns and skeletal muscle and is localised both in plasma membrane or in the mitochondrial membrane.


kegg pathway analysis

the david functional analysis tool was used for the kegg canonical pathways enrichment analysis using the list of differentially expressed transcripts . pathways terms with a% fdr <  <dig> were considered as significantly enriched. we obtained results in agreement to the go_bp analysis described above . amongst the over-expressed genes,  <dig> categories were significantly over-represented ,  <dig> were related to immune response,  <dig> to aminoacid metabolism,  <dig> to cell adhesion,  <dig> to p <dig> signalling pathway and  <dig> to ppar signalling pathway. within the p53-signalling pathway kegg identified three additional genes which were not identified by go: dna damage binding protein- <dig> or p <dig>  which is expressed in a p <dig> dependent manner and is involved in global genome repair¸ tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 10b or death receptor  <dig>  which is a trail receptor which engages a caspase dependent apoptosis cascade involving the intracellular adaptor fadd and is induced by dna damage in a p <dig> dependent manner and thirdly, p <dig> effector-related to pmp <dig>  which is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a transmembrane protein widely expressed in response to p <dig>  for the under-expressed genes, kegg identified  <dig> significantly enriched pathways that could be grouped into those related to muscle contraction , sugar and glycogen metabolism  and calcium homeostasis . thus, kegg analysis reinforced and complemented the go data and highlighted the importance of the p <dig> pathway.

ingenuity pathways analysis 

we applied ipa to the list of differential genes to further explore the biological significance of the expression data. ipa predicts those affected molecular functions, the upstream regulators  which appear to be activated within a set/group of differential genes as well as the diseases and disorders which are likely to be associated with a given expression profile . the top  <dig> molecular functions associated with tk <dig> deficiency consisted of cell death and survival, cellular function and maintenance  and small molecule biochemistry . another function predicted to be activated was immune cell trafficking  whereas functions related to cardiovascular and skeletal system development and function were predicted to be diminished.

ipa allows the identification of the cascade of upstream transcriptional regulators  that can explain the observed gene expression changes in a user’s dataset. it is based on prior knowledge of transcriptional regulators and their targets in the ingenuity knowledge database. when the direction of change is consistent with the literature  across the majority of targets for a given tf then the tf is predicted to be active. ipa identified tp <dig>  tp <dig>  htt, tp <dig> and ncoa <dig> as the top  <dig> activated tf in our dataset .

tp <dig>  tp <dig> and tp <dig> belong to the same family and encode tumour proteins that are key regulators of cell survival and cell death. htt encodes for huntingtin which up-regulates the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor . the nuclear receptor coactivator  <dig>  is a transcriptional coregulatory protein that acylates histones, which makes downstream dna more accessible to transcription.

ipa identified several highly connected and well scored networks of interacting genes consisting on a number of the over-expressed and under-expressed genes identified in our study  and others that the software predicts as also forming part of the same network. highly interconnected networks are likely to represent significant biological function, and a score is calculated as the likelihood that focus proteins are in the network due to random chance. of particular interest was the network “cell death and survival, dna replication, recombination, and repair, cellular response to therapeutics” network which is shown in figure  <dig>  hub genes in this network are puma/bbc <dig>  perp, bid, tnfsf <dig>  tnfrsf10b, tp53i <dig>  mx <dig>  isg <dig> as focus genes, and tp <dig>  rela, mdm <dig>  cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  yy <dig>  casp <dig>  casp <dig> as non-focus genes. tp <dig> shows the highest connectivity as clearly revealed by the representation of the network. the cellular sub-localisation for each node, when known, is also given.

genes differentially expressed in skeletal muscle with large mtdna deletions versus mtdna depleted muscle

summary

in order to discern those gene expression changes specific to mtdna depletion and not due to generalised mitochondrial dysfunction we used muscle with large mtdna deletions as a disease control  since these can also present in children, affect several mtdna genes and muscle samples are more widely accessible. using the statistical test rankprod we identified  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes that were significantly under-expressed or over-expressed respectively  in mdel muscle relative to mds muscle . thus, the expression profile of both groups of mitochondrial myopathies is markedly different. the complete list of differentially expressed genes between these two groups is shown in additional file  <dig>

the top  <dig> under-expressed and over-expressed genes in this comparison are listed in table  <dig>  the top  <dig> under-expressed genes coincide with genes which are very significantly over-expressed in tk <dig> deficient versus control muscle. this is the case for the markers of muscle fibre regeneration  and fibrosis . this reflects the differences in the pathology of both forms of mitochondrial disease, muscle biopsies from patients with mdel generally do not show proliferation of connective tissue or generation and in fact ck levels are normal whereas they are elevated in mds patients with tk <dig> mutations.

likewise, the majority of the top  <dig> over-expressed genes in this comparison correspond to genes which are significantly under-expressed in tk <dig> deficient muscle relative to controls such as fbp <dig> and atp2a <dig> highlighting the marked repression of those two genes  in the mds group. there are however two genes which are significantly over-expressed in kss relative to mds which are not significantly altered in tk <dig> deficient muscle. these encode keratin-associated-protein  <dig>  and an ef-hand containing ca2+ binding protein, calmodulin-like  <dig> .


gene ontology

go analysis revealed induction of several metabolic pathways  in the mdel group relative to mds muscle .  <dig> of those were the same go_bps that were repressed in mds muscle relative to normal muscle and were mainly related to glucose and glycogen metabolism and skeletal muscle system. the remaining  <dig> go_bps were unique to the mdel_mds comparison. out of those we were particularly interested in the  <dig> categories related to protein catabolism, the tca cycle  and co-factor metabolism 

within the protein catabolism category we found  <dig> unique genes. these encode several ubiquitin-specific-proteases , which are responsible for the release of ubiquitin from degraded proteins, genes encoding for ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes , which catalyse the second step in the ubiquitination process and several components of the e <dig> ubiquitin- ligase complex .

the tca related go functionalities contained  <dig> unique genes encoding for subunits b and c of the respiratory chain complex ii , subunits beta of succinate-coa ligase , dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase  and isocitrate dehydrogenase  both of which participate in pyruvate metabolism. the co-factor metabolism category included genes encoding various enzymes and co-factors such as pantothenate kinase  <dig>  and phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase , both of which participate in coenzyme a biosynthesis, and cox <dig> which is important for assembly of complex iv of the respiratory chain.

there were  <dig> go_bp categories significantly repressed in mdel versus mds group .  <dig> of them were not induced in mds group relative to control. angiogenesis appeared to be attenuated in mdel group relative to mds with  <dig> unique genes significantly under-expressed including various collagen genes , proteoglycans , blood vessel survival factors , growth factors  and early response genes downstream of growth factors such as zfp36l <dig> 

thus, this go analysis indicates that intermediate metabolism involving the tca cycle and protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-proteasome system are significantly induced as a result of large mtdna deletions. in contrast, angiogenesis is impaired.


kegg pathway analysis

kegg identified  <dig> canonical pathways as significantly enriched in mdel relative to mds including the tca cycle . only  <dig> canonical pathways appeared attenuated in mdel relative to mds amongst which we found p <dig> signalling and two pathways related to the immune response.

meta-analysis
in order to find out how many genes were differentially expressed in common in both the mds and mdel groups, relative to normal muscle, we applied the web based application biovenn  <cit>  which allows comparing and visualising gene lists.  <dig> unique genes  were in common , table  <dig> 

these included gdf- <dig>  haemoglobin genes , inflammation related genes , collagens , fatty acid transport . in most cases the direction of the change was the same  but to a different degree. for example, in mds muscle actn <dig> was under-expressed by almost  <dig> fold whereas in mdel it was under-expressed by  <dig> fold. however, for a few genes the direction of the change was opposite. this is the case for aquaporin  <dig>  which was under-expressed  in mds muscle whereas it was over-expressed in mdel muscle  and also for angptl <dig>  col1a <dig>  c8orf <dig>  myh <dig> and il71d .

validation of changes in expression
we selected some of the most significant and markedly differential genes to measure their expression levels using a quantitative pcr approach. the tk <dig> deficient group included three of the four samples used in the array . the disease control mdel group included three of the four samples with large mitochondrial dna deletions used in the array  and an additional sample . in addition we studied one patient with mutations in sucla- <dig> . results were expressed relative to tata box binding protein  and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase  <dig>  as endogenous control genes to normalize transcription levels amongst patients. results were analysed with qbaseplus software. fc above or below  <dig>  were considered significant.

differential expression was confirmed for all the selected genes  although the dynamic range of differential gene expression was different for the two techniques. this was particularly true for the genes with the highest levels of over-expression, gdf- <dig>  trib- <dig>  col19a <dig> and fgf <dig>  most genes that were changed in tk <dig> deficient muscle were also changed in the same direction in muscle with sucla <dig> defects, for example, the glycolytic genes fbp <dig>  pfkfb <dig> and ldha. however, there were some differences such as cytochrome b which was over-expressed instead of under-expressed as in tk <dig> deficient muscle.

to confirm that muscle cells are able to transcribe some of the mrnas of interest we performed qrt-pcr using rna from the immortalised skeletal muscle cell line lhcn-m <dig>  whereas fibroblast express higher levels of trib <dig> than muscle cells. when compared to normal muscle tissue, muscle cultures expressed significantly higher levels of gdf- <dig> but comparable levels of trib <dig> . thus, the source of gdf- <dig> could be the muscle cells themselves as opposed to the fibroblasts or other cell types present in the tissue.

expression of gdf- <dig> as a possible biomarker of mitochondrial disease
growth and differentiation factor- <dig> , also known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine- <dig> , is a member of the transforming growth factor beta  superfamily. to evaluate the potential application of gdf <dig> as a biomarker for mitochondrial diseases we conducted a small pilot study and measured its serum levels by elisa. in healthy children  the mean concentration of gdf- <dig> was  <dig>  pg/ml and the normal range  between  <dig> and 701 pg/ml which is comparable to what has been described in other studies  <cit> . we studied  <dig> patients with molecularly confirmed mitochondrial myopathy and although the levels of gdf- <dig> were highly variable they were on average very significantly increased relative to the control group   . the highest levels were detected in two patients with polg mutations  followed by p <dig> of this study carrying tk <dig> mutations  and a patient with lactic acidosis and epilepsy bearing the mtdna a3243g mutation , . gdf- <dig> serum levels were within the normal range  in  <dig> children with muscular dystrophy .

in addition we measured gdf- <dig> levels in the conditioned medium from cultures of lhcn-m <dig> myotubes and normal dermal fibroblasts. we were able to detect gdf- <dig> in both muscle and fibroblast cultures indicating that both cell types are able to secrete it. levels in muscle cultures were higher than in fibroblasts .

discussion
high-sensitivity microarray technology provides a useful tool to study changes in the whole transcriptome of skeletal muscle samples in relation to specific genetic or biochemical mitochondrial defects  <cit> . this is the first report of global gene expression analysis of tk <dig> deficient human skeletal muscle. there is a previous study of gene expression in fibroblasts from patients with tk <dig> or dguok mutations  <cit> . using this approach we have detected significant changes in a set of over  <dig> genes which represents the adaptative response of skeletal muscle cells to tk <dig> defects and the subsequent severe mtdna depletion. furthermore, we have also identified changes in common with another form of mitochondrial myopathy that also affects various mtdna encoded components of the respiratory chain. these two pathologies only share a small proportion of differential genes compared with normal muscle which indicates that the cell responds differently to various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction and that the changes that we have observed are specific to tk <dig> deficiency.

our data indicate that tk <dig> deficiency results in important changes in genes involved mainly in metabolism, regulation of the cell cycle and mitochondrial dna maintenance, oxidative stress and apoptosis.

metabolism
we found over-expression of several transcripts involved in the starvation response. these include asns, psat <dig>  fgf- <dig> and trib <dig>  these genes, which were also over-expressed in twinkle deficient mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> , have in common the presence of an amino acid response element  in their promoter region where transcription factors of the atf family bind to induce their expression upon limited nutrition  <cit> . thus, these results suggest that tk <dig> deficiency induces a starvation-like response which alters lipid and aminoacid metabolism.

two out of the three key enzymes of the de novo thymidine nucleotide synthesis pathway were co-ordinately over-expressed in the array, shmt <dig> and tyms. coordinated expression of both proteins, but not of the third enzyme in the pathway, dihydrofolate reductase , has been previously reported  <cit> . this may represent a compensatory mechanism for defective salvage pathway due to the severe reduction of tk <dig> activity. alternatively, it may reflect the fact that there is an increase in regenerating cycling muscle cells which rely on de novo synthesis as opposed to non-regenerating muscle which is considered post-mitotic and thus depends mainly on the salvage pathway.

p <dig>  mitochondrial dna maintenance, cell cycle and oxidative stress
tp <dig> gene encodes p <dig>  a tumor suppressor gene which is activated by several forms of cellular stress such as dna damage, oxidative stress, ribonucleotide depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction as well as by other stimuli  <cit> . p <dig> plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cell cycle, dna repair and apoptosis  <cit> . under conditions of oxidative stress, p <dig> traslocates to mitochondria where it binds the mitochondrial dna polymerase  and the mitochondrial transcription factor a  and promotes base excision repair and/or replication of mtdna. treatment of cells with n-acetylcysteine  prevents traslocation of p <dig> to mitochondria  <cit> .

in the present study we have demonstrated activation of several genes and pathways regulated by p <dig>  pig <dig>  encoding tp53i <dig>  a nadph dependent medium chain dehydrogenase reductase  was amongst the over-expressed p <dig> targets. pig <dig> expression can also be activated by p <dig> and p <dig>   <cit> . tp53i <dig> plays a dual role. on the one hand as a ros producer upon induction by p <dig> to promote apoptosis and on the other hand as a dna breaks sensor that activates the dna damage response pathway  after translocation to the nucleus. in normal cells subjected to genotoxic stress, the ddr pathway stabilises p <dig> which induces pig <dig> transcription. if the damage is not excessive pig <dig> produces certain amounts of ros insufficient to induce the expression of other pro-apoptotic genes but also promotes dna repair. if the damage cannot be repaired very high levels of pig <dig> produce very high levels of ros and finally trigger apoptosis  <cit> . it is interesting to mention that tp53i <dig> gene is within a genomic region identified by calvo et. al as being linked to mitochondrial disease  <cit> . although mutations in tp53i <dig> gene have not been identified in humans, a role for cancer predisposition of certain polymorphisms has been proposed.

we found over-expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor  <dig>  and growth arrest and dna-damage-inducible alpha  both of which are known to prevent progression of the cell cycle at the g <dig> and g <dig> level respectively and are downstream targets of p <dig>  <cit>  .

thus, we hypothesise that mtdna depletion leads to p <dig> activation to promote mtdna replication and repair both via its role as a transcription factor and via its interaction with pol γ and mttfa in mitochondria.

on the other hand, mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent reactive oxygen species accumulation amplifies the p <dig> signalling cascade which induces the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, activation of caspase- <dig> and apoptosis in damaged cells.

the p <dig> pathway has been previously associated with mitochondrial dna depletion. on the one hand, p <dig> deficient mouse and human fibroblasts show reduced mtdna copy number  <cit> .on the other hand, mutations in rrm2b cause a severe subtype of mds which mainly affects skeletal muscle and kidney  <cit> . rrm2b encodes the r <dig> subunit of the p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase which converts ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding deoxyribonucleosides which is essential for dna repair  <cit> . mutations in rrm2b null mice suffer from renal failure, growth retardation, and early mortality and show decreased mtdna content in kidney, muscle and liver  <cit> . in the present study we did not find increased expression of rrm2b but its activation via post-transcriptional mechanisms cannot be excluded.

progressive muscle fibre loss is a feature of muscle biopsies from patients with tk <dig> defects. apoptosis has been described in various neuromuscular conditions  <cit>  including some mitochondrial myopathies  <cit> . mitochondria play a key role regulating the susceptibility of cells to undergo apoptosis because they are involved in oxidative stress, ca2+ homeostasis and energy supply and several of the pro- or anti-apoptotic factors localise to mitochondria. in the present study we have demonstrated for the first time evidence of over-expression of several pro-apoptotic factors , caspase- <dig> enzymatic activation and dna fragmentation in human skeletal muscle deficient for tk <dig>  anti-apoptotic drugs have been shown to prevent apoptosis, ameliorate muscle histology, slow loss of muscle fibres and increase body weight and survival in animal models for congenital muscular dystrophy and some of these drugs are under consideration for clinical trials in humans  <cit> . in view of our results, the use of such compounds may also be beneficial in tk <dig> deficient muscle to prevent rapid muscle loss.

p <dig>  glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation
in addition to its role as “guardian” of the genome, p <dig> is emerging as a key regulator of many metabolic processes including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial stability  <cit> . p <dig> induces the expression of tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator  which affects fbp <dig> , which was under-expressed at the rna level in our microarrays, and limits the activity of phosphofructokinase  <dig> thus lowering the rate of glycolysis. in this way, some glycolytic intermediates can be utilized in the pentose phosphate pathway which feeds into de novo nucleotide synthesis. p <dig> is also known to induce the expression of apoptosis inducing factor , which is essential for complex i function  <cit>  and of its mitochondrial homologue aifm <dig> which was over-expressed  in our microarrays thus, it would seem that in the context of tk <dig> deficiency, p <dig> may be inhibiting glycolysis and promote de novo nucleotide synthesis. we cannot exclude that some of the observed changes are associated with selective loss of type ii fibres.

gdf-15
in humans, gdf- <dig> is predominantly expressed in the placenta, with low levels in the kidney, pancreas, and prostate. however, its expression can be rapidly induced by cytokines such as interleukin- <dig> and tgf-β  <cit> . gdf- <dig> has diverse biological functions. early studies have shown that low serum gdf- <dig> levels correlate with miscarriages, indicating that it might be able to suppress inflammation in early pregnancy  <cit> . gdf- <dig> also plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis since it is dramatically increased in many types of cancers  <cit> . the expression of gdf- <dig> is strongly induced by p <dig> and anti-tumorigenic agents, such as the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  <cit> . serum gdf- <dig> concentrations have been shown to be also associated with the risk of acute coronary syndrome as well as its prognosis. gdf- <dig> can be produced by cardiac myocytes in response to ischemia, nitrosative or oxidative stress and angiotensin ii  <cit> .

gdf- <dig> mrna was dramatically increased  in tk <dig> deficient muscle and it was also elevated in mtdna deleted muscle . we confirmed its over-expression by qrt-pcr in muscle tissue and also in the lhcm-n <dig> cell line demonstrating that skeletal muscle cells can transcribe this gene. using elisa we demonstrated that lhcn-m <dig> synthesise and secrete gdf- <dig> to the extracellular space. thus, gdf- <dig> could be produced by muscle cells in vivo in response to oxidative stress and p <dig> activation. however, contribution from other cell types cannot be excluded.

we conducted a small pilot study to evaluate the potential application of gdf- <dig> as a biomarker of mitochondrial disease by measuring its serum concentration by elisa. we established the normal range in our population of healthy children and studied serum from patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease. on average, gdf- <dig> levels in patients were  <dig> times higher than in the healthy control group. two patients had values that fell within the broad normal range that we established . nonetheless the gdf- <dig> concentration was  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than the normal mean value and would fall within a smaller range . we also included  <dig> non-mitochondrial myopathies children with severe dystrophies whose gdf- <dig> values were normal. we are currently extending this study to include more patients with mitochondrial diseases , non-mitochondrial myoapthies and various neurometabolic disorders, to correlate gdf- <dig> plasma levels with other biochemical markers   <cit>  as well as with muscle histopathological markers such as cox negative and/or ragged-red fibres.

in spite of the limited number of patients and disease controls and the necessity for a larger study, the mrna and protein data strongly suggest that gdf- <dig>  may serve as a biochemical marker to aid in the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
the integrated use of gene ontology, kegg pathways, ipa databases and statistical and visualization tools has allowed us to place the differential gene expression data obtained from the microarrays into a coherent functional context. our data suggest that mtdna depletion due to tk <dig> defects leads to activation of p <dig> signalling pathway. p <dig> induction may represent a compensatory mechanism to promote dna repair and replication in mitochondria. in addition, p <dig> inhibits glycolysis to promote the pentose synthetic pathway. the inability of some muscle cells to replenish the dntps pools and overcome the loss of mtdna beyond a certain level  is likely to result in sustained ros production by tp53i <dig> and activation of other pro-oxidative and pro-apoptotic factors which lead to the death of a proportion of muscle fibres. p <dig> and oxidative stress probably induce the expression and secretion of gdf- <dig> into the circulation. this finding may be exploited as a tool for diagnosis of mtdna depletion and other mitochondrial myopathies although further studies are required.
