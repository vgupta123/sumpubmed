BACKGROUND
members of the genus peromyscus are mice found from alaska to central america and from the atlantic to the pacific. they occur in a wide range of habitats including sea-level wetlands and beaches, forests, prairies, deserts, and mountains of elevation up to  <dig>  ft. this genus contains not only the two most wide-spread mammals in north america, the deer mouse  and the white-footed mouse , but also contains north america's most endangered mammal, the perdido key beach mouse .

peromyscines are unique non-traditional research models and have been studied extensively under both field and laboratory conditions in such diverse areas as epidemiology, speciation, habitat adaptation, behavior, toxicology, and aging  <cit> . several strains maintained at the peromyscus genetic stock center  exhibit neurological defects and stereotypical behavior that are not characterized in either mus or rattus. furthermore, they are the reservoirs of several emerging human diseases, including hanta virus pulmonary syndrome  <cit> , lyme disease  <cit> , ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis  <cit> .

although peromyscus species are phenotypically similar to mus and rattus, peromyscus is an exclusively north american genus and is only distantly related to these old world species, having diverged from the common ancestor of the mus/rattus lineage ca.  <dig> mya  <cit>  . thus, they not only provide an excellent outgroup for evolutionary study of mus and rattus, they also provide an additional group for evolutionary studies between these two common laboratory models and humans. like mus and rattus, peromyscus are readily adaptable to laboratory conditions. however, their natural variation makes them better suited for modeling the effects of genetic diversity on a trait of interest.

despite the abundance of studies on this genus, research has been limited by the lack of molecular genetic resources. recently though, there have been significant contributions in this area in the form of bac libraries for p. maniculatus rufinus  and p. leucopus , hundreds of microsatellite loci , and interspecific backcross and whole-genome radiation hybrid cell mapping panels  <cit> . a genomic linkage map of peromyscus is needed to fully exploit all of these resources and advance peromyscus as a model species.

to aid in the production of a linkage map, cdna libraries of placenta tissue and testis tissue were constructed and used in the production of type i  markers. placenta and testis were chosen because genes regulating reproduction are known to evolve rapidly  <cit> . therefore, genes expressed in these tissues are likely to contain polymorphisms that are easily detectable in interspecific backcross and radiation hybrid mapping panels. by sequencing clones from cdna libraries the expressed portion of the genome can be characterized. these expressed sequence tags  may then be identified by homology to mus and rattus, thus providing data useful for evolutionary analysis, gene expression, and mapping. below we characterize sequences of clones from these cdna libraries.

RESULTS
overview
we sequenced the 5' ends of  <dig>  placenta clones and  <dig>  testis clones. after removing low quality sequences, clustering sequences into gene families, and contig assembly, there remained  <dig> unique placenta and  <dig>  unique testis sequences . we then determined the number of est sequences that typically constituted a cluster . at the clustering stage,  <dig> %  of the placenta ests belong to unique singletons because they did not share >  <dig> bp identity with any other est. for the testis library,  <dig> %  of the testis ests were singletons. after related ests were clustered into gene families, ests within those clusters were assembled into contigs representing unique genes. for the placenta library, this resulted in  <dig> clusters containing just one long sequence, while three clusters contained two contigs and one cluster contained  <dig> contigs. for the testis library,  <dig>  clusters contained a single contiged sequence and one contained >  <dig> contigs.

*refers to the number of est sequences in a cluster at the clustering stage and the number of contigs at the assemble stage.

to analyze for any size bias in this collection of ests, we examined the distribution of est lengths as well as their average. for placenta, est length ranged from  <dig> –  <dig>  bp with an average of  <dig> bp . over 85% were between  <dig> –  <dig> bp, which is consistent with the aforementioned finding that  <dig> % of placenta clusters contained only a single est and that the maximum reads with our sequencers is ~900bp. for testis, the range of est lengths was  <dig> –  <dig>  bp with an average length of  <dig> bp . these average lengths are likely limited by sequencing technology. therefore, most of the genes represented in these libraries are likely much longer. all ests have been deposited in genbank with continuous accession numbers of ev <dig> – ev <dig> 

est annotation and function
analysis of the peromyscus est sequences using the blastx algorithm resulted in the identification of  <dig>  mus musculus and  <dig>  rattus norvegicus orthologs, nearly all of which yielded identical results . thus, approximately 82% of all ests were identified. inability to identify the remaining 18% could be due to a multitude of causes, including but not limited to: significant sequence divergence of peromyscus genes from mus and rattus, genes unique to peromyscus, or sequences from untranslated regions, which would not be identified in a blastx search because blastx only compares translated amino acid sequences. although blastn searches may reveal additional orthologs, we did not perform them on unidentified ests in order to remain as conservative as possible.

est contig sequences were blasted against mouse  and rat  refseq database using blastx. only matches with e-values of ≤  <dig> were considered significant.

*the homolog hit with lowest e-value was selected .

†redundant homolog records were removed when more than one est hit with the same homolog.

once the ests were identified they were further classified according to their biological processes or gene ontology. of  <dig> placenta ests,  <dig>  and  <dig>  had a known biological process term associated with their function in mus and rattus, respectively. for the  <dig>  testis ests these numbers were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mus and rattus, respectively. examination of the  <dig> most common gene ontology  categories for rattus orthologs of the placenta ests indicated that they are primarily involved in multiple metabolic processes, transport, and signal transduction . for the mouse orthologs, the top  <dig> categories are the same and occur in approximately the same proportions. differences were very minor and likely due to more complete annotation of the mus genome. for the testis ests, the rattus orthologs' biological processes are very similar to the placental ests. they are primarily involved in multiple metabolic processes, transport, and signal transduction  and the mus orthologs again have nearly identical biological processes.

utility of ests for mapping
because the peromyscus genome organization is known to be more similar to rattus than mus  <cit> , the distribution of ests across the rat genome is likely to be representative of the distribution in peromyscus. to determine if these libraries represent genes from all chromosomes proportionally, the numbers of annotated ests occurring on the autosomes and the x chromosome in the rattus genome were compared to the numbers of ests that would be expected to occur on each chromosome. expected numbers for each chromosome were based on the proportion of total rattus genes represented on each chromosome, and those proportions then scaled to a library of the same size as the placenta and testis libraries. thus, chromosomes whose genes are over- or under-represented in the libraries may indicate areas of abundant or reduced transcription, respectively. the observed est distribution in fact does differ significantly from the expected random distribution for both placenta and testis . because of the large sample sizes  the chi-square results may reflect only minor differences, as the observed and expected numbers rarely differed by more than a few ests. however, as functional groups are frequently found on the same chromosome resulting in linkage disequilibrium  <cit> , the result is not surprising. here, the difference between expected and observed as a proportion of the expected number of ests is potentially informative. for example, in the placenta library, 100% more ests were observed on rattus chromosome  <dig> than would be expected by chance alone . similarly, rattus chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> had 62% and 46% more ests, respectively, than would be expected from random expectation. thus, the abundance of the genes identified from these three chromosomes may reflect the importance for the development and maintenance of placental tissue and also reflect specific placental functions .

conversely, rat chromosomes  <dig> and x had 43% and 35% fewer genes than expected. under-representation of placental genes on the rat x chromosome is surprising, as the mus x chromosome is known to be enriched for genes primarily transcribed only in female mice  <cit> , an observation attributed to the silencing of the paternal x chromosome in the placenta of female mammals  <cit> . this paucity of placental genes cannot be explained by evolutionary differences among mus, rattus, and peromyscus, as fluorescent in situ hybridization shows the genes on the x chromosome are shared by all three species  <cit> . thus, these female-specific transcripts on the x chromosome may have little to do with placentation. alternatively, placentation genes on the x chromosome may have diverged significantly from mus and rattus, thus reducing the likelihood of positive identification with the blast search.

for the testis library, an abundance of testis-related genes were found on rat chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which had 42% and 37% more genes than random expectation. these chromosomes likely account for the paucity of testis-related genes on rat chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and x, which have 30%, 35%, and 57% fewer genes than expected by chance. the lack of testis-related genes on the x chromosome is not surprising, as recent research demonstrates the x chromosome lacks genes involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . the only chromosomes that are consistently under-represented in both libraries are the x and y. in fact, if the x chromosome is excluded, the observed distribution does not differ from expected for either the placenta or testis library , although this result is only marginal for the placenta library. for all other chromosomes, these two libraries provide a sufficient number and distribution of markers to effectively span at least 90% of any given chromosome, therefore providing a valuable and effective marker resource for mapping the peromyscus genome. in fact, prior to the development of these ests, the peromyscus genetic stock center had mapped most of only  <dig> chromosomes. those  <dig> chromosomes were finished with the aid of new est markers, and all or parts of  <dig> additional new chromosomes were mapped using mostly the est markers  <cit> . recently,  <dig> additional chromosomes have been partially mapped using only est markers .

although abundant, the most useful ests are those located in unmapped regions. of  <dig> ests occurring in areas that would bridge gaps in the existing peromyscus genome map, a blastn search indicated that  <dig> matched non-coding dna better than they matched their associated protein,  <dig> yielded no significant similarity, and  <dig> matched a different chromosome than expected. these few unidentified ests may have resulted from a failure of the blastn algorithm to recognize more highly diverged sequences as orthologous. of the remaining  <dig> ests,  <dig>  ests offered good candidates for primer design, of which  <dig>  were selected for initial testing. to qualify as a good candidate for primer design, a blastn of the est sequence to mus must match the expected protein only and either span an intron  <dig> –  <dig> bp or ≥  <dig> bp of the est must occur in an untranslated region. of the  <dig> primer pairs designed and tested,  <dig>  were easily amplified and contained polymorphisms useful as assays for typing on a backcross panel of peromyscus maniculatus × p. polionotus . this number is a conservative estimate, however, as  <dig>  have been optimized but not sequenced because they were not needed.

of  <dig> placenta ests with a significant protein match based on a blastx search,  <dig> also had a single high-probability blastn match to the mus genome, and therefore were likely to be highly specific for mapping purposes. of these,  <dig> ests  contained  <dig> microsatellite repeats distributed as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide microsatellites. one est contained  <dig> trinucleotide microsatellites,  <dig> contained  <dig> trinucleotide microsatellites, and  <dig> contained a di- and a tetranucleotide microsatellite. for  <dig> testis ests with only one blastn match to the mus genome,  <dig> sequences  had  <dig> microsatellite repeats distributed as  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide microsatellites. three contained  <dig> dinucleotide microsatellites,  <dig> had  <dig> trinucleotide repeats,  <dig> had  <dig> trinucleotide repeats, and  <dig> contained  <dig> tetranucleotide repeats. in addition, one est each contained a di- and a tri-, a di- and  <dig> tri-, a di- and tetra-, and a tetra- and pentanucleotide microsatellite. because of the high variability of microsatellites within a population, they are ideally suited for qtl analysis. thus, these libraries not only serve as markers for general map construction but as markers that will allow the discovery of genes underlying phenotypic variation. microsatellites found in these libraries may be particularly useful in this regard because they are actually contained within known genes. this is a distinct advantage over most microsatellites which are found in anonymous, non-coding regions and are associated with specific proteins only by virtue of physical proximity.

CONCLUSIONS
the generation of several thousand ests from reproductive tissues has significantly expanded the molecular resources available for the genus peromyscus. this provides an invaluable resource of genetic markers for constructing genomic linkage maps of the genus, a project currently underway and partially completed by the peromyscus genetic stock center and others . the resulting map will better enable researchers to genetically examine phenotypes in a species displaying naturally-occurring genome variation. a peromyscus linkage map will also provide information for studying the evolution of rodent genome organization, in particular by aiding in the reconstruction of the ancestral rodent genome. such evolutionary insight on the functional organization of the rodent and mammalian genomes may help link abundant mus and rattus research to human studies. in addition, these ests provide a resource for informative microarray and qtl analyses and single nucleotide polymorphism discovery. these uses will be particularly informative in peromyscus because several species are known to hybridize in the laboratory. identification of the genetic differences between interbreeding species can further our understanding of hybrid dysgenesis and genomic imprinting  <cit> . thus, the development of these libraries will allow peromyscus research to answer questions that traditional mus and rattus models simply cannot address.
