BACKGROUND
dna methylation is a chemical process in which a methyl group is added to the carbon- <dig> position of a dna cytosine. in most vertebrates, dna methylation typically occurs on the cytosine of a cpg dinucleotide
 <cit> , although some specific examples of other types of methylation have been shown to play roles in specific tissues
 <cit> . since its discovery over  <dig> years ago, dna methylation has been linked to many important biological phenomena such as the suppression of gene expression
 <cit> , imprinting
 <cit> , x chromosome inactivation
 <cit> , epigenetic reprogramming during mammalian development
 <cit> , and cancer development
 <cit> . therefore, the study of genome-wide methylation patterns is currently of great interest to researchers, particularly in areas related to the molecular mechanisms of development, cancer, and chromatin dynamics.

when dna is treated with sodium bisulfite, unmethylated cytosine residues are converted to uracil, while 5-methylcytosine residues are unaffected. later in bisulfite sequencing  experimental protocols, pcr amplification or sequencing converts the uracil residues to thymines. the next step of finding the correct genomic location for a bisulfite-treated read  is a complicated and difficult process. although cytosine to thymine changes are allowed for when mapping the bsrs to the genomic sequence, methylated and unmethylated cpg locations are often identified and, in some cases, it is impossible to distinguish between a bisulfite -treated thymine that originated from an unmethylated cytosine, and a true thymine from a different genomic location or an individual genomic variation at that location
 <cit> . this ambiguity is often magnified by the presence of sequencing errors or low-quality bases. as a result, sophisticated computational strategies are required for aligning reads from bs-seq experiments.

the first whole-genome methylation profiles were performed on arabidopsis thaliana. to map the resultant bsrs, alignment algorithms based on a probabilistic formulation and a suffix tree
 <cit>  as well as reference genome conversion
 <cit>  were used. however, it is not computationally feasible to apply this approach to larger genomes such as the human genome, or to experiments with the current deeper sequencing depths. later algorithms, such as bsmap <cit> , constructed seed tables of locations from both the original reference sequence and the bs variants, and then extends the seeds to form a possible mapping location. this seed extension process can be somewhat unreliable because the seeds must be exact and do not take into account bs-treated variations. bs alignment methods such as bs seeker <cit> , bismark <cit> , and brat-bw <cit>  have been used to map bsrs. these methods employ a burrows-wheeler transformation
 <cit>  for fast exact string matching and then combine the results with either a pre-processing or post-processing script to handle bsrs with three letters after converting all cs to t. the strength of these methods lie with reads with fewer mismatches, but they offer very limited support for aligning reads with insertions or deletions . these methods also have difficulty in aligning ts in the reads to cs in the genome without also  aligning for cysteines in the reads to thymidines in the genome. more recently, the last alignment program has been adapted to align bsrs
 <cit> . last uses a seed extension approach similar to the one used by ncbi blast
 <cit> , but the speed and mapping accuracy are increased by using variable-length seeds and base quality information
 <cit> .

in this study, we present a highly accurate probabilistic mapping algorithm, genomic next-generation universal mapper for bisulfite sequencing , for bsr alignment. gnumap-bs is an extension of the genomic next-generation universal mapper 
 <cit>  that can accommodate the alignment of bsrs to a reference genome. gnumap-bs was developed to achieve higher accuracy than other bs-seq approaches by including base quality scores in the alignment process. in addition, the gnumap-bs probabilistic mapping approach allows for the unbiased estimation of dna methylation, especially when reads are aligned to multiple genomic locations.

RESULTS
we compared gnumap-bs with several commonly-used bs alignment methods, namely bsmap 
 <cit> , bismark
 <cit> , last <cit> , and brat-bw <cit> . we also compared gnumap-bs with the unpublished proprietary probabilistic aligner novoalign  because it uses a probabilistic approach that is similar to the approach used in gnumap-bs. for a fair comparison, we considered only common options that were shared by all the alignment methods; otherwise, we used the default values or slight modifications of the defaults to achieve the best performance for each method. for each aligner, we allowed up to three or four base pair differences within 100-bp bsrs. for gnumap-bs and novoalign, this resulted in cutoff values of -a  <dig>  and -t  <dig>  respectively. considering that repeated genomic sequences often appear in mammalian genomes, we allowed up to  <dig> multiple mapping locations for each read. this approach to handling multiple alignments has only a small impact on the sensitivity of the more heuristic algorithms, but has moderate sensitivity gains in more traditional approaches like gnumap-bs. the bismark software only reports up to two valid alignments. the parameter values that were used for each alignment method are given in table
 <dig> 

parameters in parentheses were used for the human bsr dataset. up to  <dig> to  <dig> sequencing errors or mutations were allowed in a 100-bp long bsr. because the human genome contains many repeated genomic regions,  <dig> valid mapping locations were allowed for a given read when the alignment method supported this feature.

we used two datasets to evaluate the performance of each of the alignment methods. the first was a simulated bsr dataset, which was carefully designed to mimic a typical human methylation experiment. the second was a real human bs-seq dataset, which was compared with an experimentally-derived human methylome profile.

simulated bisulfite sequencing experiment
for the simulation study, we randomly assigned 20% of the cgs in the whole human genome  to represent unmethylated cytosines  by changing them to thymidines , thereby simulating complete bs conversion. for the remaining 80% of the cgs, 75% was randomly assigned to be fully methylated and, therefore the cs remained as cs. the remaining 5% was assigned to be methylated in proportions between  <dig>  and  <dig> . in this dataset, we assumed that all non-cg sites remained unmethylated, so these cs were all changed to ts for read generation. we used the dwgsim  simulation tool with parameters -e  <dig> - <dig>  - <dig>  <dig> -y  <dig>  -r  <dig>  -r  <dig>  -c  <dig>  to generate 100-bp bsrs with a 10? read depth across the genome. this simulation produced a bs-seq dataset that contained approximately  <dig> million  reads with a sequencing error rate that ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and increased from the 5’ to 3’ ends, plus 5% randomly generated sequence, and a mutation rate of  <dig>  .

we found that the mapping sensitivities of the probabilistic aligners gnumap-bs , novoalign , and last , were higher than the sensitivities of bsmap  and bismark , as shown in table
 <dig>  the bismark-bowtie <dig> algorithm had the lowest false positive rate , but at the cost of an approximately 7% decrease in its sensitivity. overall, the bismark-bowtie <dig> algorithm had  <dig>  m fewer false positives than gnumap-bs, but approximately  <dig> m fewer bsrs were aligned correctly to the genome. the bismark-bowtie algorithm performed better than bismark-bowtie <dig> in that it aligned  <dig> m more reads with only a slight increase in the number of incorrectly aligned reads. the last algorithm aligned nearly all the bsrs  to the genome, but although the proportion of correctly mapped reads was similar to that of gnumap-bs, the error rate was much higher. brat-bw was not included in this comparison because the application software removed the original sequence header/name which contained information pointing to the correct alignment location of the bsrs.

simulation study of  <dig> million  simulated bsrs generated from the human genome reference sequence. the gnumap-bs algorithm was the most sensitive aligner, especially for reads with ≥ <dig> sequence variant . the bismark algorithm had the smallest error rate with  <dig>  m fewer erroneously assigned reads than gnumap-bs, however gnumap-bs correctly aligned  <dig> to  <dig> m more reads. the bsmap algorithm had the fastest total run time, however its sensitivity was less than the sensitivity of the gnumap-bs algorithm. last mapped nearly all reads with a sensitivity that was comparable to that of gnumap-bs, but the mapping error rate for last was much higher than it was for gnumap-bs.

differences in sensitivities of these methods were much more pronounced for bsrs that contained at least one sequencing error or genome variant, and the gnumap-bs sensitivity was clearly better than the sensitivities of the other approaches . we also evaluated how accurately each aligner predicted the cg methylation levels when the true methylation level ranged from 10% to 90%. all the alignment methods tested performed well with mean absolute errors less than  <dig>  and with standard deviations less than  <dig> .

when the computational performances of each of the methods were compared , we observed that gnumap-bs required the most ram  and bismark required the least . because some of the software applications presented here support computation on multiple threads and some do not, we presented two different measures of computational speed: 1) the total run time on a  <dig> cpu linux server and 2) the number of reads processed per cpu per second. gnumap-bs required approximately  <dig> hours of total compute time to process the  <dig> m bsrs, while bsmap, the fastest algorithm, was nearly nine times faster than gnumap-bs. the last application does not support parallel computing, so last had the longest total alignment time. however, the last algorithm aligned the most reads per second per cpu , while bismark-bowtie <dig> aligned the least .

human bs-seq dataset
we also evaluated the performances of the alignment methods using a bs-seq dataset generated from samples from a healthy human donor collected at the andrology laboratory at the university of utah . the bs-seq data were generated by coupling bs conversion and the illumina hiseq <dig> platform, which generated 101-bp bsrs for analysis. we aligned  <dig>  m reads from three lanes of bs sequencing data containing  <dig> m to  <dig> m sequencing reads each, to the recent build of the human genome . the human bsrs were processed for quality control as suggested previously
 <cit> . briefly, the quality control involved masking low quality bases or trimming consecutive lowest quality bases at the 3’ ends of the reads.

we used the same parameters on these data as were used for the simulation experiment  with two exceptions: -a  <dig>  for gnumap-bs and -t  <dig> for novoalign. the last algorithm again aligned the highest proportion  of bsrs to the genome, followed by  <dig> % for gnumap-bs,  <dig> % for novoalign,  <dig> % for bsmap,  <dig> % for bismark,  <dig> % for bismark-bowtie <dig>  and only  <dig> % for brat-bw.

we compared these mapping results with the sanger-based bs sequencing control data available from the human epigenome project 
 <cit>  by selecting the data that were obtained using the same type of tissue as was used in our bs-seq dataset. the hep data provides a natural gold standard for algorithmic evaluation. for this comparison, we focused on the  <dig>  hep cg sites on chromosome  <dig> , because these data provide the most comprehensive chromosomal cg coverage that is available in the hep database. the data for the other chromosomes in the hep showed similar profiles as chr <dig>  but the coverage was much sparser.

overall, the mapping results produced by the different alignment methods for the human bs-seq dataset were consistent with the results for the simulation dataset. compared with gnumap-bs, last aligned almost twice as many reads to chr <dig> ; however, the cg read coverage for last  was only about 20% higher than for gnumap-bs  . while novoalign aligned more reads to and covered more cg sites on chr <dig> than gnumap-bs, gnumap-bs had better cg read coverage  than novoalign  and the other aligners, bsmap , bismark , bismark-bowtie <dig> , and brat-bw  .

study of  <dig>  m illumina bsrs on human chromosome  <dig>  from a human donor sample. the top rows show the overall mapping efficiency, including covered cgs sites and read coverage aligned to chr <dig>  the bottom rows show the consistency of each mapping result with known methylation levels at  <dig>  cgs sites on chr <dig> available from the hep database. the concordance statistic is defined as the fraction of overlapped cgs covered by the aligner with hep cgs for which the methylation prediction error was smaller than  <dig> .

the differences between gnumap-bs and last become even less pronounced when the overlap between the mapped bsrs and the  <dig>  cgs with hep coverage on chr <dig> was considered. last aligned the bsrs to  <dig> %  of the cgs hep sites compared with  <dig> %  for gnumap-bs, and  <dig> %  for novoalign,  <dig> %  for bsmap,  <dig> %  for bismark,  <dig> %  for bismark-bowtie <dig>  and  <dig> %  for brat-bw .

to determine if increased coverage resulted in decreased alignment quality, we computed the correlation coefficient between the estimated hep methylation levels and the methylation levels estimated from each alignment method. the correlation coefficients were  <dig>  for gnumap-bs and ranged from  <dig>  for bismark-bowtie <dig> to  <dig>  for last . we also computed a concordance statistic for each of the methods as defined previously
 <cit> . briefly, the concordance is the fraction of sites for which the methylation levels  differ by less than a predefined cutoff . based on this statistic, we found that the performances of most of the aligners were similar, with concordance values of  <dig>  for gnumap-bs and ranged from  <dig>  for bismark-bowtie <dig>  <dig>  and brat-bw to  <dig>  for last . these results showed that the increased coverage levels produced by last result in lower consistency with the hep data in terms of both correlation and concordance. pairwise comparisons of the concordance for the cgs covered/not covered between gnumap-bs and the other aligners are shown in figure
 <dig>  for example, figure
 <dig> shows  <dig> cgs that were covered by gnumap-bs but not covered by bismark; the concordance of the gnumap-bs methylation estimates for these sites was  <dig> . in contrast, only six cgs covered by bismark were not covered by gnumap-bs, and the concordance for these sites was extremely low . these results clearly showed that the increased mapping coverage  obtained using gnumap-bs did not result in decreased alignment quality or methylation estimates.

CONCLUSIONS
bs sequencing presents difficult challenges to researchers attempting to process the sequencing reads from bs-seq experiments. in this work, we present gnumap-bs, a highly accurate and effective alignment algorithm that is specifically designed to estimate dna methylation levels with base-level resolution in bs-seq data. gnumap-bs uses a probabilistic approach to align bsrs to a reference genome. gnumap-bs was developed to achieve higher coverage and accuracy than other published bs-seq approaches by integrating base quality and alignment quality information in the mapping process. we have shown that the gnumap-bs probabilistic mapping approach results in an improved unbiased estimation of dna methylation across the human genome. in simulated and real datasets, we showed that gnumap-bs outperforms other bs-seq alignment methods when both coverage and consistency were balanced with sanger based bs sequencing controls.

in addition, gnumap-bs provides many high-demand features needed for constructing a high quality methylome from bs-seq data. first, gnumap-bs incorporates quality sequencing data into a dynamic programming framework. this feature gives gnumap-bs the best balance between sensitivity and specificity of the tested bsr aligners, especially for reads that contain short polymorphisms. second, gnumap-bs adaptively assigns an optimal mapping stringency based on an effective read length after the original read is trimmed. third, gnumap-bs not only relies on the maximal score alignment but also probabilistically considers suboptimal alignments; that is, the alignment score is converted to a posterior probability and the probabilistic scores quantify the likelihood of the true source location for each read across the reference genome. as a result, for both the simulated and real datasets, we showed that gnumap-bs was more effective that the other methods in detecting read locations in the presence of sequencing errors. gnumap-bs also displayed the highest consistency with a known hep methylation database. because gnumap-bs supports message passing interface  processing, the computational burden of the dynamic programming can be alleviated. moreover, with computer resources becoming cheaper, computing clusters with large numbers of nodes and cores, and more computing clouds are becoming available. therefore, memory and cpu running times are less of a bottleneck, which is especially useful for gnumap-bs alignments. for this reason, accuracy should currently be a more important concern in bs-seq data analysis.
