BACKGROUND
coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of q fever and a category b biothreat agent, has the potential for rapid, long distance dispersal. this obligate intracellular bacterium is easily aerosolized and has been known to cause infections downwind of a likely source  <cit> . in humans, inhalation is a significant route of infection as  <dig> to  <dig> organisms can cause disease  <cit> . while most cases are relatively mild, some infections result in abortions, premature birth, pneumonia, endocarditis or death. livestock contaminate the environment by shedding live c. burnetii cells in feces, urine and milk; in sheep and goats, birthing tissues contain particularly high quantities of live cells. viable c. burnetii cells can persist in the environment due to resistance to environmental degradation as a small cell variant, however their longevity is unknown. mild effects of infections in most zoonotic reservoirs enable them to remain ambulatory and facilitate continued transmission; often, domestic and wild animal hosts suffer either no disease, or only mild forms when infected  <cit> .

with the possible exception of new zealand, c. burnetii is found worldwide. studies of prevalence in livestock have produced highly variable results due to different methodologies and study designs  <cit> , similarly, pcr based detection studies also show variable levels of infection ranging from  <dig> to 100% of samples  <cit> . due to the suspected importance of livestock in maintenance and transmission of c. burnetii, dairy products have been recently sampled and show high prevalence rates  <cit> . environmental sampling in the united states also shows highly variable but widespread prevalence of c. burnetii <cit> . in the netherlands, environmental presence was correlated with incidences of q fever in humans  <cit> .

with few exceptions, the variability and relatedness among c. burnetii detected across the landscape is unknown. as such, we cannot determine the extent to which the current distribution is due to frequent, but isolated occurrences, or a single large outbreak. despite its ubiquity and importance, genotyping efforts on c. burnetii have lagged behind those of other bacterial pathogens because of culturing difficulties and the reliance of genotyping technologies on good quantity/quality dna obtained through culturing. previous genotyping methods include: restriction fragment length polymorphisms  <cit> , multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis   <cit> , multi-spacer sequence typing   <cit> , representative snps derived from mst or whole genome sequences  <cit> , and whole genome snp typing  <cit> . for c. burnetii genotyping, easy and accurate comparisons of results across laboratories are particularly important as they enable the small collections from individual laboratories to be placed into the context of global genotyping efforts.

snps derived from mst  <cit>  or whole genome sequence comparisons  <cit>  are well suited for inter laboratory comparisons and for sensitive genotyping assays that can inform evolutionary relationships among samples collected from the environment without the need for culturing. in such clonal organisms with no evidence of lateral gene transfer  <cit> , a single snp allele can accurately define a lineage, allowing for a small subset of loci to be used for genotyping  <cit> . pcr assays using taqman chemistry have been shown to approach the theoretical minimum level of detection  <cit>  and for c. burnetii, sensitive detection assays have been developed and used to gauge environmental prevalence. here, we developed canonical snp loci into sensitive taqman assays and use them for genotyping c. burnetii dna extracted from bovine and caprine milk samples collected from a single herd and from multiple milk processing plants across the usa. we aimed to test whether the current prevalence and distribution of c. burnetii is due to the circulation of multiple genotypes which would indicate frequent but unrelated coxiellosis outbreaks.

in a single herd  of dairy cows in michigan , c. burnetii dna was detected in the milk from  <dig> of the  <dig> cows sampled; however, each of the  <dig> samples collected from the bulk holding tank on the farm were positive . four of these samples contained enough dna for successful genotyping and the mst genotype was st <dig> .

milk processing plants across the usa
of  <dig> milk samples bottled at processing plants across  <dig> states,  <dig> %  tested positive for c. burnetii dna based on the is <dig> pcr assay  <cit>  . genotypes from all is1111-positive bovine milk samples were either st <dig>  were incompletely genotyped  but consistent with st <dig>  or could not be genotyped . importantly, the st20-specific snp locus  successfully amplified in  <dig> samples and all contained the st <dig> allele. in the  <dig> cases where the diagnostic st <dig> assay did not amplify, st <dig> could not be excluded as none of the other assays implied a different genotype. only  <dig> samples had detectable amounts of c. burnetii dna present as determined by is <dig>  but not enough for snp genotyping analysis . only six samples tested negative for c. burnetii dna . finally, a sample of caprine milk processed in a plant in pennsylvania tested positive for c. burnetii dna and had a genotype of st <dig> .

discussion
our results show that the current distribution of c. burnetii is the result of a few highly fit clones that appear to be largely confined to individual livestock species. the concept of distinct clades associated with species specific restrictions may explain the low apparent rate of clinical disease among human populations despite the high prevalence of these bacteria. among our samples, two sequence types were highly prevalent: st <dig> was exclusively found in samples from goats while st <dig> dominated cow’s milk with only two examples of st <dig> from goats. this pattern is consistent with other smaller studies where likely st <dig> isolates  were from cattle  <cit>  and rarely from goats: a single st <dig> sample attributed to a goat in france  <cit>  and abortions in a large commercial dairy goat herd in the uk  <cit> . likewise, recent st <dig> samples have been collected from sheep, goats and humans  <cit> . this tendency for host restriction may be the result of a stochastic introduction into a large livestock population allowing for an increase in frequency, spread through trade, but constrained to that population through anthropogenic isolation of livestock species. however, as both genotypes show a tendency for host restriction and similar patterns are found in europe  <cit>  as well as the usa, it seems more likely that these genotypes are evolutionarily adapted to certain host species.

genotyping historical collections of c. burnetii has provided a baseline for environmental distribution of sequence types  <cit> . interestingly, contemporary sampling yields only a small subset of the known genotypes, many of which are found across multiple studies  <cit>  . in some cases, subtypes of the same mst genotypes were identified  <cit> . consistent with these findings, our genotyping of milk samples revealed only three or four mst genotypes; while only two samples had unknown genotypes , the genotypes of all other samples are likely to be either st <dig> or st <dig>  it is important to note that additional genotypes not detected by our sampling may be circulating at very low levels. a high proportion of recent milk, placenta, and mucus samples from goat, cow and sheep farms in spain were st <dig>  but none were st <dig>  <cit> . kersh et al. recently genotyped c. burnetii dna from us environmental samples and found st <dig>  st16/ <dig>  and st <dig> genotypes. samples associated with goats were st <dig> and all st <dig> samples came from cattle dairies . in the netherlands, a study by tilburg et al.  <cit>  sampled st <dig> from cattle and st <dig> from humans, sheep and goats. huijsmans et al.  <cit>  also genotyped recent samples from the netherlands, albeit not with mst. however, overlapping reference samples, the results from tilburg et al.  <cit>  and a comparison to the phylogenetic relationships of mst genotypes, suggests that the huijsmans  <cit>  genotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are likely to be  mst genotypes st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> respectively.

while likely st <dig> samples have been associated with recent livestock and human clinical samples, such associations with likely st <dig> samples are rare  and it is not clear if any of the spanish st <dig> samples were from animals with clinical manifestations  <cit> . from the recent outbreak in a uk dairy goat herd  <cit>  and historical collections, it is clear that st <dig> can cause disease in humans and livestock  <cit> . the scarcity of st <dig> among clinical samples, despite being the dominant genotype among cow milk samples, suggests that u.s. st <dig> strains have a reduced ability to cause disease in humans or cause a very mild form.

prevalence of c. burnetii on goat and cow farms has been previously assessed, but comparisons across studies are difficult due to different serological or dna-based detection methods. sampling individual animals, herds, or products pooled across herds also confounds comparisons although as expected, prevalence generally increases as bulk samples become inclusive of more individuals  <cit> . similarly, we found that milk from four of  <dig> sampled cows were positive while all  <dig> samples from the bulk milk holding tank  were positive. our milk samples from retail brands bottled in commercial processing plants likely include milk pooled from different  dairy farms, making it impossible to know the extent and distribution of infections among cows and herds. however, our detection of c. burnetii dna in every goat and cow milk sample from the same brands  over time and >95% of milk samples from processing plants across the usa shows high prevalence at either or both the individual and herd levels. indeed, the prevalence rate reported here is comparable to the high rates reported in other studies  <cit> . notwithstanding existing immunity, infectious diseases are density dependent, leading us to suspect that the ratio of infected to uninfected cows on some farms may be greater than our single farm results. nonetheless, while a small number of infected animals may contaminate a large quantity of milk, it is probable that a significant portion of the  <dig>  million dairy cows in the usa  <cit>  are infected with c. burnetii at any given time  <cit> .

across the ~ <dig>  year period of sample collection, there was no variation in prevalence of c. burnetii dna in milk samples and almost no variation in genotypes detected. as processing plants receive milk from the same dairies over time, it is likely that the same herds and even the same animals were sampled multiple times. major temporal changes in prevalence and genotypes should be detectable. indeed, minor genotypes were detected among the goat milk samples, indicating ephemeral emergence of different types. conversely, subtle changes may be masked by the milk pooling process and the ability of a single infected animal to contaminate large quantities of milk. indeed, other studies suggest that there is evidence of seasonality: in cows, shedding in milk is not associated with parturition  <cit>  although seroprevalence is highest in the autumn  <cit> . in goats, c. burnetii are highly abundant  in birth tissues  <cit>  and more likely to be shed after parturition  <cit> . human infections are therefore likely to be more common during livestock birthing seasons  <cit> , suggesting that infection variation among goat herds might also be seasonally linked. seasonality is often associated with a boom and bust cycle of transmission, and the lack of strong seasonal patterns may increase disease persistence.

as pathogens are dispersed across the landscape, elapsed time allows for cellular replication and opportunities for genetic mutations to accumulate, providing genetic signatures to identify the patterns and speed of dissemination. the presence of the same genotypes among samples from across the country and the world is indicative of rapid dispersal of particular gentoypes and subsequent ecological establishment across these regions. while a paucity of historical samples and sampling efforts prevents us from estimating when these sts became dominant, no st <dig> isolates were collected in the u.s. before  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, the only u.s. c. burnetii samples isolated from milk with a known date were obtained from cows in california  and ohio   <cit> . both samples are st16/ <dig>  showing that the dominant genotype among cows may have recently changed. higher resolution genotyping will be important for discerning dissemination patterns and mechanisms of these c. burnetii genotypes as dispersal may be due to long distance aerosol spread, trade, or other anthropogenic means. for example, sexual transmission through semen  <cit>  from the small stock of infected breeding bulls used to breed holstein cows throughout the world could result in shared genotypes. however, additional resolution among st <dig> and st <dig> samples has been shown with mlva  <cit>  and demonstrates that dissemination speed and patterns may have allowed for the accumulation of genetic differences and thus discerning patterns, mechanisms and barriers to dispersal may be possible. unfortunately, mlva is not as well suited for genotyping low levels of target dna and the little additional resolution afforded by mlva is not likely to be sufficient for defining detailed patterns of dispersal for this pathogen. high infectivity, low virulence and ease of aerosolization coupled with the speed and global reach of modern trade has likely resulted in these complex and subtle patterns of dissemination that will be challenging to resolve. whole genome sequencing will likely provide additional signatures that may prove to be our best hope for maximizing genetic resolution, untangling dispersal patterns and better estimating the speed and mechanisms of dispersal for c. burnetii.

CONCLUSIONS
coxiella burnetii is a highly infectious and easily aerosolized biothreat agent that is abundant in the environment and among livestock, yet few human q fever cases are reported. despite high potential for human infections, knowledge of phylogeographical patterns are lacking due to difficulties in culturing this obligate, intracellular bacterium. using sequences from diverse strains, we developed and employed a genotyping system that does not require culturing and is capable of genotyping residual c. burnetii dna from pasteurized milk. our results show very high prevalence of two dominant genotypes, one for bovine milk and one for caprine milk, likely due to rapid population expansion and persistence among u.s. livestock. different dominant genotypes associated with different host species indicate barriers to cross-species transmission and may explain why we have not seen an associated proliferation of human infections. the genetic patterns coupled with spatial analysis suggest independent co-circulation of multiple c. burnetii genotypes among different dairy livestock species in the united states.
