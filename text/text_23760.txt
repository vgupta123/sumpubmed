BACKGROUND
soft tissue sarcomas  account for ~1% of all malignancies and represent a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors, the clinical management of which is challenging and requires multidisciplinary efforts that take the combined information from clinical investigations, imaging, histopathology, and cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses into account. sts comprise more than  <dig> histological subtypes, although malignant fibrous histiocytoma /undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma , liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma , and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor  account for three-fourth of the tumors  <cit> . some sts subtypes are characterized by specific chromosomal translocations causing novel gene fusions e.g. ss18-ssx in ss and tls-chop in myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma. however, a large group of sts, e.g. mfh/ups, leiomyosarcoma, and dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma, lack known specific recurrent alterations and are characterized by a multitude of rearrangements, amplifications, deletions, and somatic alterations, including mutations in tp <dig>  deletions of rb <dig> and cdkn2a, and amplifications of mdm <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> .

gene expression studies have revealed diagnostic profiles and upregulation of specific pathways in sarcomas with type-specific genetic defects, e.g. ss, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, clear-cell sarcoma, ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors   <cit>  and have provided potential targets for novel therapies  <cit> . from a diagnostic point of view, the above mentioned tumor types can be identified from their underlying gene fusions, but the expression data reveal novel genes and pathways including multiple downstream targets of the resultant chimeric transcription factors, which provide a basis for the understanding of key biological changes in sts development. in contrast, molecular classification of the predominant, genetically complex sts subgroups, e.g. mfh/ups, leiomyosarcoma, and dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma, has been difficult with extensive pleomorphism that has precluded identification of recurrent profiles  <cit> . sts are highly malignant and metastases develop unpredictably in one-third of the cases, therefore, new prognostic markers would be of great clinical value. however, there have been only two reports of expression profiles associated with poor outcome in sts, both in leiomyosarcomas  <cit> . with the aim to establish diagnostic expression profiles for sts and to assess whether gene expression profiling can provide prognostic information, we used  <dig> k cdna microarrays to characterize the expression patterns in a mixed series of  <dig> sts, with particular focus on high-grade pleomorphic tumors.

RESULTS
diagnostic signatures
unsupervised analyses
when the  <dig> sts were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis, based on the  <dig> spots that passed the filter criteria, the dendrogram split into two major branches . one branch  consisted mainly of sts with simple, type-specific genetic defects and contained 31/ <dig> ss, all  <dig> myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, all  <dig> gist and all  <dig> fibrosarcomas, in addition to 5/ <dig> mpnst, 3/ <dig> leiomyosarcomas, 5/ <dig> mfh/ups, 2/ <dig> sts not otherwise specified  and the single epithelioid sarcoma. herein, ss, gist, myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, and mpnst formed tight subclusters. the other branch  consisted mainly of genetically complex, often pleomorphic sts subtypes and contained 55/ <dig> mfh/ups, 37/ <dig> leiomyosarcomas, all dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas, myofibroblastic sarcomas, and extraskeletal osteosarcomas along with the remaining  <dig> mpnst,  <dig> sts nos,  <dig> ss and the single giant-cell mfh and malignant mesenchymoma. a subset of  <dig> leiomyosarcomas formed a distinct tight subcluster within c. when the  <dig> xenograft samples were included, a similar pattern of unsupervised clustering was observed and all  <dig> xenografts derived from tumors included in the study clustered next to their respective patient samples  suggesting that expression patterns of xenografts well reflect those of patient tumor material. a separate unsupervised cluster analysis of the  <dig> liposarcomas  separated the  <dig> myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas  from the  <dig> dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas  .

supervised analyses and discriminatory gene lists
discriminatory gene lists were generated by ranking genes based on their golub-scores and performing  <dig> random permutations to establish false-discovery rates  . as expected, the strongest expression signals  characterized sts subtypes with specific genetic defects, e.g. ss, gist and myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma. the mfh/ups, leiomyosarcoma, and mpnst were characterized by discriminatory gene expression signals containing  <dig> –  <dig> genes with fdr of 11%. weak signals with high fdr characterized the fibrosarcoma  and dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma , whereas myofibroblastic sarcoma and extraskeletal osteosarcoma were small heterogeneous groups without discriminatory profiles.

synovial sarcoma
the ss were characterized by the strongest expression signature containing  <dig> differentially expressed genes with a fdr of only 11%. multiple developmental pathways that interact to regulate embryonic development and organogenesis were upregulated in ss. these genes included erbb <dig>  fgfr <dig>  fgfr <dig>  fgf <dig>  and frag <dig> from the egf and fgf receptor signaling pathways, members of the hedgehog  signaling pathway like ptch, smo, bmp <dig>  foxm <dig> and csnk1e, retinoic acid receptor  pathway genes like rara, rarg, mdk, meis <dig> and prame, and genes involved in notch receptor signaling like notch <dig>  jag <dig> and the transducin-like enhancer of split genes. ease  identified overexpression of the wnt receptor signaling pathway including axin <dig>  lef <dig>  tcf <dig>  wisp <dig> and the frizzled homologs, and the tgf-β signaling pathway including runx <dig>  smad <dig>  tgfb <dig>  tgfb <dig> and the bone morphogenetic proteins. one of the largest functional groups of upregulated genes was that involved in chromatin remodeling including several histones and swi/snf related matrix associated actin dependent regulator of chromatin  genes. a large number of neural differentiation genes like efna <dig>  ncam <dig>  nedd <dig>  npdc <dig> and olfm <dig>  ribosomal protein genes, many forkhead box transcription factors and the ss chromosome x breakpoint genes ssx <dig> and ssx <dig> were also highly expressed .

gastrointestinal stromal tumor
the gist, with activating mutations in the kit gene were characterized by a distinct expression profile of  <dig> genes , including top overexpressed genes involved in the kit receptor signaling pathway, e.g. kit, and prkcq , and other developmental pathways, e.g. bmp <dig>   fgf <dig>  igf <dig>  sfrp <dig> and tle <dig>  as well as neurogenesis and neural differentiation genes like smpd <dig>  hoxa <dig>  cit, hoxa <dig>  sim <dig>  nptx <dig>  nedd <dig> and dctn <dig>  other groups of highly expressed genes identified in the ease analysis were those involved in protein transport, lipid metabolism and kinase activity .

myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma
a distinct expression signature of about  <dig> differentially expressed genes  characterized the myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas. herein, several lipid metabolism genes, including dgkd, ebpl, fabp <dig>  lpl, mgll and pparg were upregulated, as were many developmental genes, ribosomal subunit genes and genes involved in amino acid and carboxylic acid metabolism .

malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
golub-score analysis identified a 100-gene signature  characterized by overexpression of developmental pathway genes like frag <dig>  wisp <dig>  rarres <dig>  spry <dig> and smo from, e.g. the wnt, rar and hh signaling pathways. moreover, genes related to neural development such as nedd <dig>  npdc <dig>  gstp <dig>  and dscr <dig>  and several ribosomal protein genes were also highly expressed .

leiomyosarcoma
a 200-gene signature  characterized by overexpression of muscle-specific genes like actn <dig>  cald <dig>  mbnl <dig>  mlc <dig>  myh <dig>  myl <dig>  slmap, tpm <dig> and tagln <dig> was identified in the leiomyosarcomas. ease analysis also identified upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and energy pathway genes .

malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
a 300-gene signature  was identified for the mfh/ups samples and the top upregulated functional groups included cathepsins and genes related to protein degradation, inflammatory response, cell motility, proliferation, cell-cycle control, and intracellular signaling .

discriminatory gene lists with high fdr
the gene lists for dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma had large numbers of false positives among the ranked genes. however, the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas were characterized by a weak discriminatory 150-gene signature, which when used in a supervised cluster analysis grouped 5/ <dig> dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas tightly with  <dig> mfh/ups,  <dig> leiomyosarcomas and  <dig> fibrosarcoma. despite the high fdr, cdk <dig>  mdm <dig>  mdm <dig>  os <dig> and sas, were among the top overexpressed and are along with several other highly expressed genes, e.g. nup <dig>  slc26a <dig>  slc35e <dig>  tmbim <dig>  tsfm and yeats <dig>  located in the 12q <dig> and 12q <dig> amplicons. ease analysis also identified the above-mentioned gene group on chromosome 12q14-q <dig>  interestingly, also the mfh/ups, the leiomyosarcomas and the fibrosarcoma that clustered tightly with the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas showed amplification of cdk <dig> and mdm <dig> when analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization  or southern blot analysis  <cit> . in addition, genes involved in receptor activity, signaling and lipid metabolism  such as acaa <dig>  arsa, dhrs <dig>  pde3a, and ppara, were upregulated .

golub-score analysis identified a relatively poor discriminatory signal of  <dig> genes for the fibrosarcomas, which regardless of high fdr contained several of the upregulated genes previously associated with fibrosarcoma, e.g. bmi <dig>  h1f <dig>  lef <dig>  rbm <dig>  itm2a, igfbp <dig> and ptgs <dig>  <cit> . upregulation of developmental genes like bmp <dig>  smo, vangl <dig>  sfrp <dig>  prrx <dig>  mdk, olfm, igfbp <dig>  igfbp <dig> and tgfbr <dig> in the fibrosarcoma samples suggests similarity to ss, gist, myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma and mpnst explaining its classification within subcluster s in figure  <dig> . this shows that fdr, though important, cannot be taken at face value without the risk of losing biologically relevant information, especially in the case of sts where high fdr may result not only from heterogeneity and errors in diagnosis but also due to common pathogenic pathways resulting in similarities or overlap of expression profiles between different sts subtypes.

myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma vs. dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma
in an independent analysis , the  <dig> myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas were compared to the  <dig> dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas. a 800-gene signature  distinguished the two groups . developmental genes including members of the wnt receptor signaling pathway, e.g. daam <dig>  fzd <dig>  myc, prickle <dig>  sfrp <dig> and wisp <dig>  and neurogenesis genes, e.g. cpne <dig>  efna <dig>  fez <dig>  lhx <dig>  mdk and ntng <dig> were upregulated in the myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas as compared to the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas, as were several ribosomal protein genes and genes involved in adhesion and amino acid metabolism. genes highly expressed in the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas included cell-cycle genes like ccna <dig>  ccnb <dig>  cdc <dig>  kifc <dig>  kif <dig> and pttg <dig>  motility genes like amfr, anxa <dig>  ckb, cnn <dig> and fn <dig> and homeostasis-related genes. a smaller number of lipid metabolism genes were overexpressed in the myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas compared to the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas with genes such as dgkd, ebpl, fabp <dig>  fdft <dig>  lpl and pparg upregulated in the former group, while adm, anxa <dig>  anxa <dig>  cryl <dig>  grn, pla2g4a, pla2g12a, pld <dig> and pltp were overexpressed in the latter . similar results were obtained even with the exclusion of the  <dig> xenograft samples further supporting the notion that xenografts reflect gene expression patterns of patient tumor material and can with some caution be included in gene expression studies of sts to increase sample size for rare tumor types.

prognostic signature
about 50% of the patients diagnosed with sts succumb to their disease owing partly to the high metastatic potential of these tumors but risk-assessment is rather difficult with very few reliable prognostic factors  <cit> . the different sts subtypes are associated with variable outcome with a favorable prognosis for patients with myxoid liposarcomas and a high risk of metastases for patients with mfh/ups and ss  <cit> . since the majority  of the tumors in our series were high-grade, pleomorphic sts, we chose to evaluate the presence of a prognostic signature within subcluster c among the most heterogeneous samples. after excluding local recurrences, metastases, samples treated with preoperative chemotherapy, the single ss and  <dig> mpnst , the  <dig> leiomyosarcomas with a distinct profile, and the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas with the mdm2-cdk <dig> double amplification,  <dig> primary sts remained for the analysis. exclusion of the leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas that formed subclusters within c was done in order to detect the more subtle prognostic signal among the most pleomorphic samples .

supervised analysis
golub-score analysis with  <dig> random permutations identified a 200-gene prognostic signature  distinguishing tumors that metastasized  from those that remained metastasis-free  . in order to obtain a more robust list of discriminators, a consensus gene list of  <dig> genes with median rank less than  <dig> was generated, as described in the methods section, with the majority of the genes from the golub-score ranked list being present in the consensus list. hierarchical clustering based on the consensus list split the  <dig> samples into two clusters with metastases developing in 6/ <dig>  in the low-risk cluster compared to 33/ <dig>  in the high-risk cluster . the genes overexpressed in the metastasizing tumors included hyou <dig>  hif1a, hig <dig>  ddit <dig>  tfrc, ero1l, plod <dig>  and adm suggesting an expression program triggered by hypoxia. hypoxia causes stabilization of the hif- <dig> transcription factor that mediates the induction of several genes including those promoting anaerobic glycolysis  <cit>  and the most significant functional group identified in the ease analysis included glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters like eno <dig>  eno <dig>  pygl, fut <dig>  hk <dig>  glut <dig>  gys <dig>  pdk <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig>  pgk <dig> and ldhb, many of which are known markers for hypoxia. the overexpression of hypoxia-induced genes in metastasizing primary tumors provides a basis for further studies of hypoxia in sts to clarify its role in metastasis and to verify potential prognostic and therapeutic utility. in addition, several genes involved in cell proliferation, adhesion and motility e.g. sympk, actn <dig>  bysl, vcl, nrcam, yars and tln <dig> were among the discriminators .

support vector machine  leave-one-out cross-validation and statistical analyses
development of metastasis correlated with tumor size  and necrosis , but not with vascular invasion . the svm leave-one-out cross-validation correctly classified 64% of the samples  curve =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ) into two groups with metastasis developing in 58%  of the patients in the high-risk group, compared to 30%  in the low-risk group  and significantly predicted metastasis-free survival . the corresponding hazard ratio  from a univariate cox-regression analysis was  <dig>   and in a multivariate analysis including the established prognostic factors size, necrosis and vascular invasion, the profile predicted outcome with a hr of  <dig>   .

aproportional hazards assumptions assume constant mortailty ratios and are therefore not met. thus, the estimated hrs should be interpreted as averages over time. the effects are considerably larger initially and level off with time.

discussion
from a clinical diagnostic perspective, most sts with specific fusion proteins can be correctly classified based on the combined data from histopathology, immunostainings, and cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic analyses. this stands in contrast to the genetically complex sts subtypes, the diagnosis of which is hampered by suboptimal reproducibility due to extensive histopathological heterogeneity, pleomorphism and lack of type-specific genetic defects. distinct and homogenous expression profiles have been reported in ss, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, clear-cell sarcoma, myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma and gist  <cit> . furthermore, the discriminatory profiles that often contain genes located downstream of the type-specific pathogenic gene fusions or mutations have provided novel targets for molecular therapy  <cit> . gene expression profiles have provided clues to the histogenesis of some sts subtypes, suggested similarities between others and allowed distinction between pathologically inseparable lesions, e.g. neural crest origin of ss, close relation between clear-cell sarcoma and melanoma, and distinct expression profiles for well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas  <cit> . current data from the more pleomorphic sts, however, indicate that their expression profiles are indeed heterogeneous and in these tumor types the primary goal may rather be to identify novel, yet unidentified subgroups, and to clarify deregulated genes and pathways.

unsupervised cluster analysis of the  <dig> sts identified two major subclusters; s containing sts with specific fusion genes or mutations, e.g. ss, myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma and gist, and subcluster c with genetically complex, often pleomorphic sts subtypes, e.g. mfh/ups, leiomyosarcoma and dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma . this is in line with results from previous gene expression and proteomic profiling studies  <cit> .

discrimination scoring identified genes and pathways differentially regulated in the sts subtypes, with considerable amount of overlap with previously published gene lists despite the differences in tumor material and array platforms  <cit> . expression profiles in the distinct subtypes were strong with low fdr whereas the pleomorphic ones had relatively heterogeneous profiles with higher fdr. identification of diagnostic markers that clearly distinguish different subtypes requires gene lists with very low fdr, but inherent heterogeneity, lack of clear-cut boundaries between subtypes, misdiagnoses and common pathogenic genes and pathways make it rather difficult to generate such strong diagnosis-specific expression profiles in the pleomorphic sts. some studies chose to exclude samples that did not cluster according to histopathological diagnosis thereby reducing fdr by increasing homogeneity within the subgroups  <cit> . in the current study, outliers were included but lenient cut-offs were employed allowing some amount of false positives in the gene lists, which were then analyzed using ease to identify functionally correlated genes. the risk of signifying false positives was reduced by focusing on upregulated pathways and functional groups rather than on individual genes. this approach helped identify biologically relevant genes in dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcoma and fibrosarcoma despite high fdr and upregulation of similar functional groups in ss, gist, myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma, mpnst and fibrosarcoma.

although alternative ssx fusions and various lines of differentiation can be demonstrated in ss  <cit> , they display homogenous and distinct expression profiles that enable clear distinction from other sts subtypes  <cit>  and our finding of  <dig> differentially expressed genes is in line with these results. in the unsupervised clustering, all but one ss were part of subcluster s, within which  <dig> formed a tight subcluster, together with  <dig> mpnst samples on a separate branch, away from the main ss subcluster . supervised clustering based on the  <dig> genes also showed close clustering of ss to mpnst . previous studies have shown that ss and mpnst share similar patterns of gene expression with upregulation of neuroectodermal differentiation genes thereby suggesting a neural crest origin  <cit>  and several neural differentiation genes were also upregulated in the present study. the ss18-ssx fusion product controls gene expression by association with chromatin remodeling complexes through interactions with swi/snf complexes and histones  <cit> . interestingly, chromatin-remodeling genes including several histones and smarc genes constituted one of the largest functional groups upregulated in the ss. moreover, the genes identified herein verified the significance of developmental pathways including the fgf, egf, tgf-β, wnt, notch, retinoic acid and hh receptor signaling pathways, the targeted inhibition of which may provide novel therapeutic options.

mpnst may morphologically mimic ss  <cit>  and in the unsupervised analysis, 5/ <dig> mpnst clustered within subcluster s, and  <dig> with a subset of ss. several developmental, neural differentiation and ribosomal protein genes were found to be overexpressed in both mpnst and ss. fibrosarcomas, like the mpnst, have been shown to cluster with the ss  <cit> . the fibrosarcomas in this study were part of subcluster s and a weak expression signature including many developmental genes distinguished these tumors from the remaining sts.

gist constitute a distinct sts subtype, ~80% of which carry kit gene activating mutations  <cit> . these tumors demonstrate distinct expression profiles  <cit> , with upregulation of genes within the kit signaling pathway. in addition, several genes involved in neurogenesis and neural differentiation were overexpressed, as were muscle-specific genes like smoothelin and myosin, which may reflect the suggested origin of gist from the interstitial pacemaker cells of cajal  <cit> .

liposarcomas account for about 20% of sts and within this subtype, the myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas characterized by the tls-chop or ews-chop fusions  <cit>  formed a distinct cluster closely related to a subset of ss and mpnst within subcluster s with upregulation of several developmental and ribosomal protein genes . one of the top most upregulated genes was the lipid metabolism gene pparg that regulates adipocyte differentiation and constitutes a potential therapeutic target  <cit> . the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas contain complex genetic alterations and were scattered among the pleomorphic samples in the unsupervised clustering. most dedifferentiated liposarcomas are characterized by amplifications of mdm <dig> and cdk <dig> as part of the 12q amplicons involved in the formation of ring-chromosomes  <cit> . a relatively weak discriminatory signature mainly characterized by overexpression of the 12q amplicon genes distinguished a small subset of the dedifferentiated/pleomorphic liposarcomas . ppara and other lipid metabolism genes were also overexpressed. comparison between myxoid/round-cell and pleomorphic/dedifferentiated liposarcomas revealed overexpression of ribosomal proteins and developmental genes related to wnt signaling and neurogenesis in the former group, whereas genes related to cell-cycle, homeostasis, and a greater number of lipid metabolism genes were upregulated in the latter. skubitz et al. demonstrated separation of myxoid liposarcoma from non-myxoid liposarcoma using a set of ribosomal genes  <cit> .

our series included a large proportion of pleomorphic, undifferentiated sts with the hope of gaining novel insights into the origin of these genetically complex tumors and establishing a more refined classification. about one-third of the leiomyosarcomas clustered tightly within subcluster c and a 200-gene signature with overexpression of genes related to muscle structure and function was identified in these tumors . this is in line with previous results from gene expression and proteomic profiling demonstrating that while the more pleomorphic leiomyosarcomas cluster with the mfh, another more distinct subset cluster separately  <cit> . mfh was introduced as a separate diagnostic entity in the 1960s, but constitutes a heterogeneous group of poorly differentiated tumors with poor diagnostic reproducibility  <cit> . in our series, one-third of the tumors represented mfh/ups, all but  <dig> of which fell within subcluster c . a 500-gene signature grouped together about half of the mfh/ups  including several genes from the extracellular matrix and inflammatory response, reflecting the fibrous and histiocytic features of these tumors, as well as others involved in the regulation of cell-cycle, proliferation, adhesion, motility and protein degradation.

novel prognostic and therapeutic markers would be of great clinical value in sts since risk stratification is currently difficult and adjuvant treatments are toxic and hampered by low efficacy. we identified a 244-gene prognostic signature in  <dig> primary, high-grade sts mainly representing mfh/ups and leiomyosarcoma. this signature was characterized by upregulation of several hypoxia-related genes  and genes involved in cell proliferation, adhesion and motility in metastasizing sts. our data are the first to suggest a prognostic profile modulated at least in part by hypoxia in a large series of highly malignant sts of mixed types. the cross-validated classifier predicted metastasis with an accuracy of 64% and provided prognostic information independent of currently used prognostic factors from the sin-system, namely tumor size, vascular invasion, and necrosis  <cit> . gene expression profiles that correlate with poor outcome have previously been recognized in ewing sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma  <cit> , ren et al. identified a 92-gene signature in  <dig> leiomyosarcomas that separated high-grade metastatic tumors from low-grade well-differentiated ones, whereas lee et al. took a different approach and predicted metastasis in a set of  <dig> primary leiomyosarcomas and local recurrences using the expression profile of  <dig> genes that initially distinguished primary leiomyosarcomas from metastases  <cit> . however, none of the reported genes were among our  <dig> discriminators, which may not only be because they were established in a set of leiomyosarcomas using different approaches whereas our signature was established in a larger mixed series of pleomorphic primary sts, but also due to the difficulties in identifying prognostic signals which are considerably weaker than the diagnostic ones.

an adverse prognostic impact of hypoxia has been demonstrated in several malignancies and tumor oxygenation studies in sts have suggested an association of hypoxia with tumor grade, presence of mitoses and metastatic development  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that hif1a expression was an independent prognostic factor in sts  <cit> . hypoxic tumors display high rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis regulated by hif <dig> that induces expression of glucose transporters like glut <dig> and glycolytic enzymes like eno <dig>  hk <dig>  ldhb and pgk <dig> <cit> , which were overexpressed in the metastasizing tumors. ca <dig> expression, an intrinsic cellular marker for hypoxia, has been suggested to correlate with poor survival in high-grade sts  <cit> , and glut <dig> expression and enhanced glucose metabolism in sts have been linked to proliferative activity and tumor grade  <cit> . detwiller et al. demonstrated that the expression pattern of a selection of  <dig> hypoxia-related genes allowed distinction of mixed sts samples from normal tissue, and several of the overexpressed genes therein were among our discriminators  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, diagnostic gene expression profiles were identified for different subtypes with distinct profiles in sts with specific fusion genes or mutations, whereas the diagnostically difficult pleomorphic sts were challenging also with regards to expression profiling. the ss, gist, myxoid/round-cell liposarcomas, mpnst and fibrosarcomas shared similarities in expression profiles with overrepresentation of developmental genes involved in differentiation and morphogenesis. on the other hand, genes involved in cell-cycle, proliferation, adhesion, motility, protein degradation, homeostasis and immune-response seemed to play an important role in the pleomorphic subtypes. the novel genes and pathways identified provide important information about tumor origin and constitute potential therapeutic targets. our identification of a prognostic profile in the latter group is highly promising, and provides information independent of the currently used prognosticators. moreover, it is intriguing that upregulation of hypoxia-related genes predicts metastatic potential in high-grade, pleomorphic and genetically complex sts and calls for further evaluation of hif1a and its target genes in sts.
