BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is essential for the normal growth and development of plants because it is required for the regulation of energy metabolism, enzymatic reactions and signal transduction processes  <cit> . plants acquire p in the form of orthophosphate. though p is abundant in soil, it often forms insoluble complexes, particularly with aluminum and iron under acidic conditions and with calcium under alkaline conditions  <cit> . in addition to its slow diffusion, the low availability of p is a major environmental constraint for crop productivity worldwide  <cit> . to obtain high yields, farmers have often added excessive quantities of p fertilizer  <cit> , which mainly originate from nonrenewable rock phosphate. these large inputs of external p have led to a decrease in p-use efficiency. p-use efficiency is often less than 20 % and the remaining p becomes immobile in the soil or pollutes water bodies  <cit> . one effective way to overcome these problems is to understand the genetic mechanisms of low-p tolerance in plants and to breed crop cultivars with enhanced p-use efficiency.

to reduce the adverse effects of p stress, plants have evolved several strategies, including the re-programming of root morphology to increase exploratory and absorptive capacity  <cit> , the increased production and exudation of organic acid and phosphatases  <cit> , the establishment of symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi  <cit> , and the bypassing of the metabolic steps that require atp  <cit> . these adaptations in response to variable p availability are at least partially dependent on changes in gene expression. some key regulators of p homeostasis, which have mainly been characterized from arabidopsis and rice, include the myb transcription factor phr <dig>  which functions as the central regulator of downstream genes  <cit> ; members of wrky  and pho families  <cit> ; the mirnas mirna <dig> and mirna <dig>  <cit> ; e <dig> ligase nla and siz <dig>  <cit> ; and ips1/at <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, only a bhlh transcription factor, zmptf <dig>  has been demonstrated to increase low-p tolerance in maize; it does so by regulating carbon metabolism and root growth  <cit> .

maize ranks first in total production among major staple cereals and is not only a worldwide food and feed crop but also is an important raw material for energy production and many other industrial applications  <cit> . maize yield, however, is frequently threatened by various abiotic stresses, including low-p stress, especially in the acidic and alkaline soils of tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . macro/microarray technologies have greatly increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating p homeostasis in plants . by using an oligonucleotide microarray platform, calderon-vazquez et al. detected a total  <dig> p-stress responsive genes  in the roots of a low p-tolerant maize genotype; among these genes, at least 33 % lack an orthologue in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , suggesting that some p responsive pathways are unique in maize  <cit> .

the probes used in arrays for maize gene studies, however, were designed based on the past knowledge of maize gene annotation. as an alternative to macro/microarray technologies, high-throughput sequencing can be used to study the molecular basis of p-stress tolerance in maize. compared to macro/microarray technologies, probe-free high-throughput sequencing is more sensitive and more effective at identifying nuclear transcripts, dna repair, and chromatin modifications  <cit> . traditional rna-seq could not distinguish the sequencing data from the first- and second-strand cdna because of the lack of rna polarity information. strand-specific rna-seq overcomes this limitation and provides more accurate information than traditional rna-seq for digital gene expression analysis and genome annotation  <cit> .

although transcriptomics based on microarray platforms have greatly increased our general understanding of maize responses to p stress, a more detailed understanding of the diversity of responses in maize genotypes is needed  <cit> . in the present research, we evaluated  <dig> maize accessions for low-p tolerance under field conditions in  <dig> and  <dig>  and we selected two lines,  <dig> and ccm <dig>  that differed in their tolerance to low p for further research. based on the physiological indices tested, we used strand-specific rna-seq transcriptome analyses of leaves and roots of low p-tolerant and -sensitive maize inbred lines to explain the molecular mechanisms of genotypic diversity in maize in response to p stress. this research increases the understanding of the genetic variations and molecular basis of low-p tolerance in maize.

RESULTS
selection of genotypes with and without low-p tolerance in field and hydroponic experiments
in the field experiment,  <dig> accessions with low-p tolerance and  <dig> with low-p sensitivity were identified. the accessions with low-p tolerance were huang <dig>  te <dig>  q <dig>  dan <dig>  888– <dig>  xi <dig>  7537– <dig>  ccm <dig>  ccm <dig>  ccm <dig>  mo <dig>  si <dig>  dan <dig>  ccm <dig>  and hai9- <dig>  the accessions with low-p sensitivity were  <dig>  zheng <dig>  si <dig>  liao <dig>  706fu, qi <dig>  ji <dig>   <dig>  fr <dig>   <dig>  b <dig>  ca <dig>  liao <dig>  ccm <dig>  and ji <dig>  consistent with previous reports  <cit> , inbred line mo <dig> was found to be low-p tolerant, and inbred line b <dig> was found to be low-p sensitive.

inbred lines ccm <dig>  and  <dig>  were selected for further research because neighbour joining tree analysis indicated that these lines are closely related. we first investigated their responses to p stress in hydroponic solutions containing sufficient  or limiting  p. at the onset of treatment, relative fresh weight of shoot and root, anthocyanin levels and root/shoot weight ratio of both ccm <dig> and  <dig> were similar between p-sufficient and -deficient conditions . when plants were transferred to the p-deficient medium for 8 days, the shoot fresh weight decreased by 25 % for  <dig> and by 18 % for ccm <dig> . this difference between  <dig> and ccm <dig> increased when the p-deficient treatment was extended to 13 days  . a phenotypic difference between inbred lines ccm <dig> and  <dig> was evident at 6 days after p-deficient treatment, when an accumulation of the purple flavonoid pigment anthocyanin in older leaves was observed in  <dig> but not in ccm <dig> . the anthocyanin levels in  <dig> after 8 days of p stress was ~23 μg/g fresh weight , which was about  <dig> times higher than the level in ccm <dig>  compared with the c allocation under the p-sufficient condition, a higher proportion of c was allocated to roots after p deficiency for 8 days, especially for the low-p tolerant ccm <dig> . the root-to-shoot weight ratios were much higher for ccm <dig> than for  <dig> regardless of p treatment for hydroponically grown 8-day plants . p deficiency led to a significantly decrease in p concentration in the shoots and roots of both  <dig> and ccm <dig> . however, the total p concentration in the shoots of  <dig> was  <dig>  mg/g dw after p deficiency for 8 days, which was ~51 % lower than that of the ccm <dig> . similar results were obtained for roots . these results indicate that ccm <dig> is more tolerant to low-p stress than  <dig> even under hydroponic conditions.fig.  <dig> phenotypic and physiological responses of maize inbred lines  <dig> and ccm <dig> to p stress.  <dig> and ccm <dig> seedlings were grown in a hydroponic solution containing 150 μm or 5 μm pi for the indicated durations. a relative fresh weight of shoot and root ; b photographs of representative plants; c anthocyanin content of shoots; d root/shoot weight ratio; and e p concentrations in shoot and root of inbred lines  <dig> and ccm <dig>  for a, c, d, and e, values are means ± se . asterisks indicate significant differences as determined by t tests 




rna-seq transcriptome of genotypes with and without low-p tolerance
to identify molecular events involved in low-p tolerance, a total of  <dig> rna libraries from shoots and roots of both inbred lines ccm <dig> and  <dig> were generated. as noted earlier, the plant samples were obtained from hydroponically grown seedlings that had been provided with sufficient p for 2 days or low p for  <dig> or 8 days. each sample was represented by two biological replicates, and the libraries were sequenced by illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. these rna libraries yielded a total of more than  <dig>  billion reads after adaptor trimming, and approximately 77 % of the clean reads could be perfectly mapped to maize b <dig> refgen_v <dig>   . sequences that could not be mapped to the maize genome were discarded, and only those perfectly mapped were analyzed further. the transcripts were then classified into exon, intron, and intergenic region .

the abundance of each gene was determined by reads per kilobase million mapped reads   <cit> . the median values of log <dig> among different libraries used for differential expression assessment were comparable . we also calculated the correlation of the two biological replicates for each treatment to investigate the variability between the replicates. the pearson’s correlations  of almost all comparisons exceeded 90 % , indicating a high correlation between biological replicates.fig.  <dig> boxplot of the log <dig> expression values of roots a and shoots b of maize inbred lines  <dig> and ccm454




we further confirmed the rna-seq transcriptome by real-time rt-pcr. in agreement with our rna-seq data, the real-time rt-pcr assay showed that p stress strongly up-regulated the expression of grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and mir399j but down-regulated the expression of grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  ac <dig> _fg <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  grmzm5g <dig>  grmzm2g <dig>  and mir169c . these results further indicated that the sequencing data were reliable.

p deficiency-regulated genes in genotypes with and without p tolerance
a total of  <dig> genes in the low-p sensitive  <dig> and  <dig> genes in the low-p tolerant ccm <dig> were differently expressed in response to pi availability at one or more sampling times. among the p deficiency-responsive genes,  <dig> genes in  <dig> and  <dig> genes in ccm <dig> were up-regulated . when the inbred lines were subjected to p deficiency for 2 days, the total number of p deficiency-responsive genes was much lower in ccm <dig> than in  <dig> , indicating that pi-deficiency stress was greater in  <dig> than in ccm <dig>  p deficiency-responsive genes common to ccm <dig> and  <dig>  were detected mainly after plants had been transferred to pi-deficient medium for 8 days . in contrast, only  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes were common to ccm <dig> and  <dig> after 2 days of p deficiency .fig.  <dig> overview of p stress-responsive genes and of root-secretory acid phosphatase activity in maize inbred lines  <dig> and ccm <dig>  a venn diagram illustrating p stress-responsive genes in  <dig> and ccm <dig>  b venn diagram illustrating common or differentially expressed genes between the two lines in response to p stress. c activities of root-secretory acid phosphatase for root segments of  <dig> and ccm <dig> grown under p-sufficient and p-deficient conditions. values are means and standard errors . lsd test was used to test differences between treatments. means with the same letter were not significantly different at p <  <dig> 




the p-deficiency-responsive genes common to ccm <dig> and  <dig> should mainly result from p stress and were not related to genotypic difference. gene ontology  analysis indicated that these genes were related to various metabolic processes , phosphate transmembrane transporter activity and pi starvation responses as previously reported   <cit> .

apase activity
to confirm the go analysis concerning acid phosphatase  activity, we measured apase activity in ccm <dig> and  <dig> roots. the root-secretory apase activities in both ccm <dig> and  <dig> were significantly induced by p deficiency . after 2 days of p deficiency, the root-secretory apase activity in ccm <dig> was 121 μm/g fw/h, which was ~  <dig> times greater than the activity when p was sufficient for 2 days. in contrast, the root-secretory apase activity in  <dig> was similar under pi-sufficient and pi-deficient conditions even after 4 days of pi-deficient treatment . compared to activity under pi-sufficient condition, the root-secretory apase activity after 8 days of pi deficiency increased 4-fold in  <dig> but increased only about  <dig> -fold in ccm <dig> .

identification of degs in the low p-tolerant genotype vs. the low p-sensitive genotype under pi-sufficient condition
based on the criteria that the log <dig> fold-change ratio was ≥  <dig> and that the adjusted p value was ≤  <dig> ,  <dig> genes in shoots and  <dig> genes in roots were identified as differentially expressed genes  in ccm <dig> vs.  <dig> under p-sufficient condition . these degs were highly tissue specific, and only ~21 % were expressed in both shoots and roots . among the degs ,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in ccm <dig>  to determine the molecular events responsible for low-p tolerance of ccm <dig>  we first focused on the potential functions of up-regulated genes in ccm <dig>  the up-regulated genes in ccm <dig> were enriched for biological processes involved in phosphate metabolic process , phosphorus metabolic process , electron transport chain , and aromatic compound catabolic process .fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes between maize inbred lines  <dig> and ccm <dig> under p-sufficient conditions, and sod, cat and h2o <dig> activities. a heat map showing degs between  <dig> and ccm <dig> under p-sufficient conditions. b activities of sod and cat in the shoots of  <dig> and ccm <dig> under pi-sufficient conditions. c the hydrogen peroxide contents in the shoots of  <dig> and ccm <dig>  values are means and standard errors . asterisks indicate significant differences between  <dig> and ccm <dig> as determined by t tests 




when we analyzed the  <dig> up-regulated genes in the low p-sensitive  <dig>  and found that these degs were related to inorganic anion transmembrane transporter activity , response to stimulus , oxidoreductase activity  and response to abiotic stress . these results suggested that the physiological status of the low p-sensitive  <dig> might be sub-optimal even when sufficient p was provided. to test this hypothesis, the activities of two significant antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase  and catalase , were measured in ccm <dig> and  <dig> under p-sufficient conditions . sod activity did not differ between ccm <dig> and  <dig>  however, cat activity in  <dig> was  <dig>  u/g fw/min, which was about  <dig>  times higher than in ccm <dig>  the enhancement of cat activity in  <dig> might be due to an increase in h2o <dig> content in  <dig> .

identification of p stress-responsive degs in the low p-tolerant genotype vs. the low p-sensitive genotype
to clarify the increased low-p tolerance of ccm <dig>  we identified p stress-responsive degs between lines ccm <dig> and  <dig>  at the onset of pi deficiency, the number of p stress-responsive degs between ccm <dig> and  <dig> was small in both roots and shoots . however, some important genes involved in hormone synthesis, phosphate homeostasis and secondary metabolism were up-regulated in ccm <dig> . among these genes, ga20ox <dig>  is the key oxidase enzyme in the biosynthesis of gibberellin; grmzm2g <dig> encodes zmwrky <dig>  and the members in wrky family modulated tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice and arabidopsis ; the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase  enzyme encoded by grmzm2g <dig> limits the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of the common precursors to various isoprenoids including secondary messengers inositol polyphosphates   <cit> . the up-regulation of ga20ox <dig> and grmzm2g <dig> in ccm <dig> after 2 days of p stress was further verified by real-time rt-pcr assay .fig.  <dig> venn diagram a c and real-time rt-pcr b analysis of differentially expressed genes between inbred lines  <dig> and ccm <dig> under pi-deficient conditions. quantifications were normalized to the expression of gapdh. values are means and standard errors . activities of pod in the roots of  <dig> and ccm <dig> grown under p-sufficient and -deficient conditions are also showed d. values are means and standard errors . asterisks indicate significant differences between  <dig> and ccm <dig> as determined by t tests 




a total of  <dig> p deficiency-responsive degs were found in roots and  <dig> in shoots after ccm <dig> and  <dig> were transferred to the p-deficiency medium for 8 days . few of the p deficiency-responsive degs were common to shoots and roots . relative to  <dig>   <dig> p deficiency-responsive degs in roots and  <dig> p deficiency-responsive degs in shoots were up-regulated in ccm <dig> . in ccm <dig> roots, the up-regulated p deficiency-responsive degs were mainly involved in response to stress , antioxidant activity , and peroxidase activity . the assessment of peroxidase  activities in the roots of  <dig> and ccm <dig> confirmed that the up-regulated genes in ccm <dig> were concerned with antioxidant activity and peroxidase activity . in shoots, the up-regulated p deficiency-responsive degs were related to carbohydrate metabolic process , carbohydrate biosynthetic process , carboxylic acid catabolic process , and organic acid biosynthetic process . these metabolic processes contributed to the low-p tolerance of ccm <dig> were partly verified by the higher root-to-shoot weight ratios of ccm <dig> than that of  <dig> after pi-deficiency for 8 days . we also analyzed the  <dig> p deficiency-responsive degs in roots and  <dig> p deficiency-responsive degs in shoots that were down-regulated in ccm <dig>  the down-regulated p deficiency-responsive degs were related to phosphoric ester hydrolase activity , iron ion binding , monooxygenase activity , and electron carrier activity .

p stress-responsive mirnas
posttranscriptional gene regulation by mirnas plays important role in plant adaptive responses to nutrient deprivation . in the current study,  <dig> mirnas belonging to nine families in roots and  <dig> mirnas belonging to six families in shoots were found to be differently expressed in ccm <dig> vs.  <dig>  under p deficiency condition . the up-regulation of mirna <dig> by pi-deficiency, which have been demonstrated to regulate pi-deficient responses  <cit> , was observed in the shoots and roots of the low p-sensitive inbred line  <dig> only after 8 days of p deficiency . other nutrient-responsive mirnas, such as mirna <dig>  and mirna <dig> , were also differentially expressed in mirnas between  <dig> vs. ccm <dig>  because mirna <dig> is important in phosphate homeostasis in plants, we selected mirna <dig> for further validation by small rna northern analysis. the expression of mirna <dig> after 8 days of pi deficiency was much higher in  <dig> than in ccm <dig> , which was consistent with the sequencing data.fig.  <dig> heat map a and small rna northern analysis b of p stress-responsive mirnas between maize inbred lines  <dig> and ccm454




discussion
in our previous research,  <dig> maize germplasm including  <dig> tropical/subtropical accessions were evaluated for low-p tolerance in the field, and  <dig> low-p tolerant and low-p sensitive accessions were selected based on principal component analysis of the relative values of all traits  <cit> . based on the results, we collected additional inbred lines from different ecological zones in china, cimmyt, and usa, and evaluated their low-p tolerance. in the field screening of the current study, mo <dig> was more tolerant than b <dig> to p stress, which agreed with a previous report  <cit>  and which therefore indicated that our screening was reliable. this motivated us to identify the molecular events involved in the diversity of responses to p deficiency in maize genotypes. the gained information could help us develop genome-wide methods for mapping and for identifying markers  <cit> .

plant responses to p stress often depend on gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level. mirna <dig> is induced by p stress and regulates phosphate homeostasis in arabidopsis, rice, and soybean by suppressing a ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme, pho <dig>  <cit> . in the phloem sap of rapeseed, mirna <dig> abundance depends on p status  <cit> , suggesting that mirna <dig> might act as a systemic signal. this inference was further supported by a grafting experiment, which showed that a root-derived deficiency signal induces mirna <dig> expression in the shoots; the induced mirna <dig> is then delivered to the roots where it targets pho <dig> transcripts for degradation  <cit> . in both shoots and roots, mirna <dig> abundance was much higher in the low p-sensitive inbred line  <dig> than in the low p-tolerant inbred line ccm <dig>  in addition, the total number of p deficiency-responsive genes was also higher in  <dig> than in ccm <dig> after p deficiency for 2 days. these results indicated that the low p-sensitive inbred line experienced greater p stress than the low p-tolerant inbred line.

in several cases, research has demonstrated that altering the expression of a transcription factor can alter resistance to p stress by activating downstream target genes. the transcription factors in question include nac, myb, wryk, erf/ap <dig>  zinc finger proteins, ccaat-binding transcription factor, and members of bhlh families . among the p stress-responsive degs in the low p-tolerant line vs. the low p-sensitive line in the current study, we identified  <dig> nacs,  <dig> mybs,  <dig> bhlhs,  <dig> zinc finger proteins,  <dig> wrkys, and  <dig> spx domain-containing proteins. we also identified the calmodulin-binding transcription activator, bzip transcription activator, and c2c2-gata transcription factor as p stress-responsive degs in ccm <dig> vs.  <dig>  these results suggest that transcriptional regulation is important for low-p tolerance.

under pi-sufficient conditions,  <dig> degs  were identified in ccm <dig> vs.  <dig>  these results indicate that the low p-tolerant ccm <dig> is genetically pre-adapted to p stress. this pre-adaptation could include the ability to efficiently eliminate ros. in plants, ros are continuously produced in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes as by-products of aerobic metabolism  <cit> . because some ros species are highly toxic, they must be rapidly detoxified by enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms  <cit> . deficiencies in n, p, k, and s can induce ros production in arabidopsis  <cit> . we hypothesize that the ability to eliminate ros is greater in the low p-tolerant ccm <dig> than in the low p-sensitive  <dig> based on the following evidence:  the up-regulated degs in  <dig> under pi-sufficient conditions were highly enriched in response to abiotic stress ;  when ros increased after 8 days of p stress, the up-regulated degs in ccm <dig> were mainly related to antioxidant activity ;  pod activity was significantly higher in ccm <dig> than in  <dig> regardless of p treatment.

under p-deficient conditions, an important adaptive strategy for increasing p acquisition is the production of apases and their secretion from roots into the rhizosphere; in the rhizosphere, the apases can release p from organic sources  <cit> . the importance of apases for p-stress resistance has been clearly demonstrated by the growth of the arabidopsis atpap <dig> loss-of-function mutant and 35s::pap <dig> transgenic plants on a p-deficient medium  <cit> . our go analysis showed that the p deficiency-responsive genes common to ccm <dig> and  <dig> are enriched in apase activity . the root-secretory apase activity was also induced by p deficiency regardless of genotype. however, the root-secretory apase activity in the low p-tolerant ccm <dig> was significantly induced after 2 days of p-deficiency and remained high during p stress, whereas the root-secretory apase activity in the low p-sensitive  <dig> was significantly induced only after 8 days of p deficiency. this indicated that the low p-tolerant line responded more rapidly than the low p-sensitive line to p deficiency.

p-deficiency down-regulated gibberellin response in arabidopsis and white lupin  <cit> ; p itself, phytohormones, and universal secondary messengers, including ca2+ and ips, have been implicated in pi local and systemic sensing and signaling pathways  <cit> . at the onset of p deficiency in the current study, genes involved in the biosynthesis and signal transduction of gibberellin were identified among p stress-responsive degs in ccm <dig> vs.  <dig>  further indicating that another important way in which ccm <dig> tolerates low p is by rapidly sensing a change in pi levels in the plant.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary,  <dig> accessions with low-p tolerance and  <dig> with low-p sensitivity were identified from  <dig> maize germplasm in field experiments. by analysis of  <dig> strand-specific rna libraries from shoots and roots of ccm <dig>  and  <dig>  that had been subjected to p stress for  <dig> and 8 days, a general overview of genotypic diversity in maize in response to p stress was provided. the tolerance to low p of ccm <dig> is mainly due to the rapid responsiveness to p stress and efficient elimination of ros. these findings increase our understanding of the molecular events involved in the difference in tolerance to p stress among maize genotypes.
