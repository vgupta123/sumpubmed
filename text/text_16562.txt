BACKGROUND
the genus brachyspira currently comprises seven validly published species: b. aalborgi, b. alvinipulli, b. hyodysenteriae, b. innocens, b. intermedia, b. murdochii and b. pilosicoli. collectively these form a distinct evolutionary line within the phylum spirochaetes  <cit> . brachyspira spp. are oxygen-tolerant anaerobes that colonize the intestines of some mammalian and avian species but they differ in enteropathogenicity from important pathogens of livestock to presumed commensals. b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli are important porcine pathogens, causing swine dysentery and porcine intestinal spirochetosis respectively. two species, b. pilosicoli and b. aalborgi, can colonize humans and are suspected causes of colitis. for a review, see tsinganou and gebbers  <cit> .

b. intermedia commonly colonize the large intestine of commercially farmed pigs and chickens and has also been isolated from rodents  <cit>  and ducks . the species was originally named serpulina intermedia and described as possessing characteristics related to both the pathogen b. hyodysenteriae and the commensal b. innocens  <cit> . later the species was transferred to the genus brachyspira  <cit> . data from field studies have suggested that b. intermedia may be a mild enteropathogen of pigs  <cit> , but experimental challenge in porcine isolates has failed to produce clinical disease  <cit> . in contrast, an experimental challenge in chickens with b. intermedia isolates caused diarrhea, slow growth, and reduced egg production.  <cit> . diagnostically relevant features associated with both b. hyodysenteriae and b. intermedia include tryptophanase and β-glucosidase activity. in addition, they lack α-galactosidase activity and are unable to hydrolyze hippurate  <cit> . the two species can be differentiated by haemolytic properties, i.e., there is strong β-haemolysis in b. hyodysenteriae and weak β-haemolysis in b. intermedia. other recognized representatives of the genus brachyspira lack tryptophanase activity. identification of isolates of b. hyodysenteriae, b. intermedia and the proposed species "b. suanatina"  <cit>  by 16s rrna gene- sequence analysis is not feasible because they form a common phylogenetic cluster  <cit> . moreover, the high genetic diversity between isolates as seen from the results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-locus sequence typing, and e-burst analysis have recently challenged the species delineation of weakly β-haemolytic and tryptophanase-producing isolates as b. intermedia.  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether all isolates with the phenotype described as characteristic for b. intermedia will be included in this species in the future.

complete genome data from the two important porcine pathogens b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli and the presumed commensal b. murdochii have been recently published  <cit> . the b. hyodysenteriae genome consists of a  <dig> mb chromosome and a ~ <dig> kb plasmid. many of these genes are more related to clostridium and escherichia species than to non-brachyspira spirochetes which suggests that horizontal gene-transfer events have taken place  <cit> . the  <dig> kb plasmid is conserved among a large number of b. hyodysenteriae isolates but is not detected in any avirulent field strain, which suggests that it is important for virulence  <cit> . the only recognized gene-transfer agent in brachyspira spp. is a mitomycin-inducible defective prophage , which transducts  <dig>  kb random genomic fragments  <cit> . the b. pilosicoli genome is somewhat smaller,  <dig>  mb, and contains no plasmids. the b. pilosicoli genome has been compared to b. hyodysenteriae and a draft version of b. murdochii  <cit> . in our study the genome of b. intermedia type strain pws/at  of porcine origin was completed and subjected to comparative genomic analysis. with this new data we can now compare four completed brachyspira genomes and significantly increase the understanding of different and shared properties of the genomes. we also discuss horizontal movements of genes and the potential involvement of bacteriophages in this process.

RESULTS
general genomic features and genome plasticity
the b. intermedia strain pws/at genome consisted of a single circular  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  chromosome and a  <dig>  bp plasmid . the phylogenetic distances to the other available genomes within the brachyspira genus and to the spirochete leptospira interrogans , calculated from average nucleotide similarity of the whole core genome  <cit> , showed that b. intermedia strain pws/at was most closely related to b. hyodysenteriae followed by b. murdochii; it was somewhat more distantly related to the b. pilosicoli genome . also, average similarity distances indicated that the b. pilosicoli genome was closest to b. murdochii followed by b. intermedia and furthest from b. hyodysenteriae. this was in concordance with 16s rrna gene-based phylogeny  <cit> . the size of the chromosome was only slightly larger than that of b. murdochii 56-150t , somewhat larger than that of b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig>  and noticeably larger than that of b. pilosicoli . a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes  were predicted in the chromosome. in addition  <dig> trna genes and single copies of the ribosomal rna genes 5s , 16s  and 23s  were present. comparisons to the other sequenced brachyspira replicons are shown in table  <dig> 

the g+c content for the b. intermedia strain pws/at chromosome was  <dig> % which is similar to that of the other genomes in the genus. interestingly, the small plasmid had only  <dig> % g+c content . the g+c content in intergenic regions was  <dig> %, and in the third positions of synonymous codons it was less than 10%. this indicates that gs and cs are shunned and the average g+c content is determined by the requirements of the g+c-containing codons. the small plasmid had a lower coding density and therefore also a lower g+c content.

the approximate origin of replication on the chromosome was located on the basis of the gc-skew pattern and the sequence file was permuted to start at this point. the leading strands , defined as the plus strand from the first half of the genome and the minus strand from the second half, were enriched in gs and also weakly enriched in ts . the origin of replication has previously been assumed to be adjacent to the dnaa gene  <cit> . it has also been suggested that the origin of replication has been relocated during evolution  <cit> . our analysis showed that the origin of replication was not linked to the dnaa gene and if the origins for all brachyspira genomes were set according to the skew analysis; a distinct non-permutated x-pattern could be seen in the genome alignments . these new positionings of the origin of replications are also supported by the ori-finder program  <cit> . the relative positions of the dnaa gene and the skew-analysis based origin-of-replication are shown in figure  <dig>  the strand compositional asymmetry  is usually considered to be associated with cytocine deaminations  in les as a consequence of different exposure as single-stranded dna. however, the asymmetry can have many causes, such as transcription-coupled cytocine deaminations or repairs, differences in gene density between the strands, and residue and codon bias  <cit> . an analysis of the local gc-skew pattern in the b. intermedia genome gave oscillating values that strongly correlated with gene direction. in order to better understand the sources of the asymmetry in this genome we broke down the skew patterns into les, las, and coding and noncoding regions . the overall les skew was shown to be strongly influenced by codon frequencies on les and las. in fact, the pattern seen in a sliding window gc-skew plot was almost entirely a consequence of enrichment in the number of genes on les, i.e., a total of  <dig> genes  on les compared to  <dig> genes  on las. this skew did not seem to be an effect of transcription-induced mutations but rather constraints on codons. codons starting with g were  <dig>  times more frequent than codons starting with c. since there were more codons on les, the result was a gc-skew. codons starting with a were  <dig>  times more frequent than codons starting with t so one would expect a enrichment on les. however, since this was an at-rich genome, the impact of the mutationally induced skew was stronger for at than for gc. this counteracted the expected an enrichment, resulting in a very weak t enrichment. intergenic regions seemed to give a more unbiased measure of mutational skew with g and t enrichment on the leading strand . in addition, for any given codon position, there were relatively more gs and ts in les than in las.

genes can relocate symmetrically around the origin of replication as a consequence of replication-dependent rearrangements  <cit> . the effects of such rearrangements could be seen as an x-pattern in our alignments . interestingly, genes tended to switch between les to las at a certain frequency during this process, as represented by the intermixed red and blue dots in figure  <dig>  les and las genes could partially be distinguished from each other because they had different at-skews at the third positions of synonymous codons . an examination of the at-skew values of individual genes showed that they were normally distributed around the average for les and las . interestingly, deviations from the normal distribution were found at low skew values for les and high skew values for las . this suggests that some high at-skew genes had recently moved from les to las and some low at-skew genes from las to les. thus, there seemed to be equilibrium between las and les gene movements that slightly favored les. this is probably related to reduced fitness of the bacteria if certain highly expressed genes are moved to las because of less efficient transcription.

the  <dig>  kb plasmid in b. intermedia pws/at is also present in b. murdochii 56-150t
a  <dig>  bp plasmid was found with three putative genes: bint_ <dig> , bint_ <dig>  and bint_ <dig> . we could not assign functional annotations to these genes, but a low level of similarity was found between bint_ <dig> and a roseburia replication initiator protein . by comparing the coverage of the plasmid and the chromosome in the assembly, we could estimate the copy number to be approximately  <dig>  we used four pcr reactions to amplify the genes and an intergenic region to screen for the plasmid in a panel of  <dig> brachyspira strains . we could detect the plasmid with all four pcr reactions in b. intermedia pws/at and b. murdochii 56-150t. none of the other tested strains/isolates gave pcr products. the b. murdochii 56-150t genome has been sequenced and deposited in genbank but the plasmid has not been described  <cit> . we downloaded the b. murdochii  <dig> reads from ncbi sequence read archive  and mapped them onto our plasmid using the roche gs mapper. the recreated draft b. murdochii plasmid sequence was approximately 96% identical at nucleotide level to the b. intermedia plasmid. thus, the plasmid seems not to be restricted to b. intermedia pws/at but it is far from ubiquitous in brachyspira isolates.

the  <dig>  kb b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> plasmid previously described was not present in b. intermedia pws/at. however, some of the b. hyodysenteriae wa <dig> plasmid genes were homologous to genes in the b. intermedia, b. murdochii and/or b. pilosicoli chromosomes. several of the homologous genes showed high conservation and only  <dig> genes, many of which encode glycosyltransferases , were genuinely unique to the plasmid. a cluster of four genes  has been discussed previously in terms of virulence  <cit> . they were all conserved in the b. intermedia chromosome although one gene  contained two nonsense mutations. the rfbaa-d genes are involved in the rhamnose biosynthesis pathway and are believed to modify the o-antigen backbone of the cell wall los. these data suggest that rhamnose biosynthesis capacity may be present in b. intermedia strains, independent of their  <dig> kb plasmid. however, the inactivation of the rfba gene in this strain suggests it may not be essential for virulence in b. intermedia pws/at. it will be interesting to see if the rfba-d gene cluster is present and if it is functional in other b. intermedia strains and correlates to pathogenicity.

genome comparison
complete genome sequences from b. hyodysenteriae  <cit> , b. pilosicoli  <cit>  and b. murdochii  <cit>  are available and a comparative analysis between the completed b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli, and the draft version of b. murdochii have been made  <cit> . we can now add a fourth completed genome, b. intermedia, and also use a completed version of the b. murdochii genome to improve the comparisons. thus, we have categorized the pan-genome of the brachyspira species b. intermedia , b. hyodysenteriae , b. murdochii  and b. pilosicoli  into  <dig> classes  on the basis of a blastp e-value with a > 1e- <dig> cutoff. the number of genes in each class is shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  some genes were close to the threshold cutoff value and we therefore included the e-values in the table to describe the genes so that a manual estimation can be made for individual genes . in the previous comparisons  <dig>  genes unique to b. murdochii,  <dig> unique to b. hyodysenteriae and  <dig> unique to b. pilosicoli were defined  <cit> . here we make a more refined analysis of unique genetic material and can therefore reduce these numbers 4- <dig> fold  and add the b. intermedia specific gene category and combinatory classes . the genomic locations of the genes from the  <dig> classes are shown in figure  <dig>  unique genes were widespread around the genome but some clustering existed.

distribution of clusters of orthologous genes  categories
cog classifications were assigned to each protein by comparison to the cog database  <cit> . cog classifications have previously been made on brachyspira genomes  <cit> . our extended analysis showed that all four available brachyspira genomes had a similar overall cog profile . the cog assignments were also incorporated into the descriptions of the  <dig> conservation classes in additional file  <dig>   and the classes were compared in additional file  <dig>  "cog2" tab. the unique gene classes  were generally similar in the cogs suggesting that the main difference lies among the more poorly characterized functions. some exceptions can be noted. the b. murdochii specific genes were 5- <dig> times more abundant in the cog "amino acid transport and metabolism" and 2- <dig> times more abundant in "replication, recombination and repair" compared to the other unique classes. the ihm class  was particularly abundant in cogs representing transport and metabolism of inorganic ions, amino acids and carbohydrates. the lower number of inorganic ion transport and metabolism genes in b. pilosicoli has previously been observed  <cit> .

species-unique genes
b. intermedia had the greatest number of unique genes followed by b. murdochii whereas b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli had lower numbers . the number of unique genes at a cutoff set to 1e- <dig> and 1e- <dig> respectively was i = 269/ <dig>  h = 116/ <dig>  m = 212/ <dig> and p = 131/ <dig> . the large number of unique b. intermedia genes was partly a consequence of two prophage regions. the number of b. intermedia specific phage annotated genes was  <dig>  but probably  <dig> of the genes belong to the phages.

more specialized species usually undergo reductive evolution, thereby losing unnecessary genes  <cit> . the smaller number of specific genes in the more niched pathogens b. hyodysenteriae  and b. pilosicoli  suggests they have a higher degree of specialization. thus, the major reason for the greater number of unique genes in b. intermedia and b. murdochii is probably related to the presence of larger pan-genomes due to higher diversity within these species.

a majority of the unique genes, in all species, were annotated as coding for hypothetical proteins. this shows that, in general, the specific traits and aspects of virulence mechanisms are poorly studied. in the high-cutoff comparison , only  <dig> functionally annotated chromosomal genes specific for b. hyodysenteriae were found. there were three citrate lyases, two pepdidases, an acetyltransferase, a transmembrane protein, an ethanolamine utilization protein, an appr-1-p processing enzyme, a small muts-related domain protein, an ankyrin repeat-containing protein, an ycfa-like protein, and an orfc protein. the b. hyodysenteriae plasmid also contained several specific glycosyltransferases and hydrolases. b. intermedia specific genes, apart from phage-related genes, included five microcompartmental proteins, a beta-galactosidase, three glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase, several restriction enzyme system-related genes and an extracellular solute-binding protein. b. pilosicoli specific genes included several transporters, a peptidase, two sialidase  family-like proteins, a class d beta-lactamase and a protein possibly involved in chromosome segregation. b. murdochii specific genes included a crispr system, two capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins, two snare associated golgi -related proteins, two stam -sh <dig> domain associated-proteins, several transcription regulators, and dna replication proteins.

genes shared by two species
one could expect that the two more specialized pathogens, b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli, would share some virulence-associated genes, but they had the least number of shared genes. actually, only two hypothetical proteins were shared at the higher stringency level. this most likely reflects the fact that these two species seem to exploit distinctly different life strategies. the greatest number of shared genes for any pair of species was that for b. murdochii and b. pilosicoli. the high number was partly a result of a common phage found in one copy in b. pilosicoli and in three copies in b. murdochii. the phages are described in more detail below.

genes shared by three species 
the greatest number of shared genes between three species was in the class b. intermedia, b. hyodysenteriae and b. murdochii. one could see these genes as conserved genes lost by b. pilosicoli during reductive evolution. in particular, b. pilosicoli has lost many transport-related proteins which could reflect its adaptation to a more specialized ecological niche. the higher level of reductive evolution in b. pilosicoli suggests it is an older pathogen than b. hyodysenteriae. the pathogenicity of the younger b. hyodysenteriae could be related to its acquisition of the  <dig> kb plasmid. the least number of genes was found in the b. hyodysenteriae, b. murdochii and b. pilosicoli category. this corresponds to conserved genes lost by b. intermedia. this, once again, shows b. intermedia to be the species with the largest number of accessory genes.

bacteriophages and their role in horizontal gene transfer 
a phage-like gene transfer element named vsh- <dig> is known to have the capacity to transduct randomly packaged genomic material between b. hyodysenteriae strains  <cit> . the b. intermedia vsh- <dig> region had a small cluster of putative vsh- <dig> like genes located approximately  <dig> kb upstream of the main part of vsh- <dig>  similarly as previously described in b. hyodysenteria  <cit> . here we report two new b. intermedia bacteriophages, pi <dig> and pi <dig> . pi <dig> was located almost completely adjacent to the vsh- <dig> phage-like element . it had a size of ~ <dig> kb and contained  <dig> genes  of which  <dig> were unique to b. intermedia also at the high stringency level . interestingly, one gene coding for a hypothetical membrane-spanning protein, bint_ <dig>  was conserved in b. hyodysenteriae . this suggests that an hgt event has taken place and that the pi <dig> phage has acquired this gene from another b. intermedia or b. hyodysenteriae strain and transferred it to this strain.

the second phage, pi <dig>  was ~ <dig> kb and contained  <dig> genes  divided into three regions. the first region  and the third  were unique for b. intermedia also at the high stringency level. however, the second region  had similarities to both the vsh- <dig> phage-like element of the brachyspira species and to the shared phage found in b. pilosicoli and b. murdochii. thus, this phage seems to be a hybrid that has acquired new properties from other phages or vsh- <dig> phage-like elements. the genes in this region were annotated as hypothetical proteins and endolysin glycoside hydrolase.

in the gene classification described above, one bacteriophage was found conserved in b. pilosicoli and b. murdochii. one copy was present in b. pilosicoli  and three in b. murdochii . two of the b. murdochii phages, pm <dig> and pm <dig>  were almost identical to each other while the pm <dig> phage showed higher variability, especially in one region. a comparison of the pp <dig> phage with the pm1- <dig> phages revealed an extra gene, bp951000_ <dig>  that codes for a dna methylase . this gene had a deviating gc-skew value compared to all other phage genes suggesting that it recently had been inserted into the phage. the dna methylase was most related to a lactobacillus dna-methylase . thus, the gene has probably been acquired from outside the brachyspira genus.

it has been shown that brachyspira spp. and clostridium share an unexpected amount of significant gene similarity  <cit> . when comparing the pp <dig> and pm1- <dig> phages to sequences in genbank, we found homology to a clostridium phage in the complete genome of the c. botulinum strain a <dig> kyoto . this suggests the phages may occasionally transfer between species and genera and exchange genetic material resulting in cross-species and cross-genus hgt events.

in our analysis, we have seen several indications of putative hgt events mediated by bacteriophages. however, we still have only a single genome sequence for each species and this is a major limitation when analyzing hgt events. the rapid development of sequencing technology will hopefully give us opportunity to characterize a larger set of genomic data from brachyspira spp. in the future. this will permit a more robust hgt analysis. also the gene classification will become more robust as the dataset will grow. the accessory gene-pool is likely to increase, but the truly unique genes for each spices will likely decrease, sorting out the essential species specific factors better.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we classified the accessory gene pool into different classes of shared and unique genes. in general, the unique genes are poorly annotated, which shows our lack of knowledge about species-specific processes. b. intermedia and b. murdochii contain more material specific to them and probably a larger pan-genome. b. hyodysenteriae and b. pilosicoli are both more specialized pathogens that have less accessory genetic material and diversity. they have specialized independently, as seen by the little genetic material shared only between them. these two genomes were also the two smallest, indicating that reductive evolution had taken place  <cit> . the traces of reductive evolution involved loss of genes, especially transport proteins. this is most obvious in b. pilosicoli suggesting it has been influenced by reductive evolution for a longer time. the pathogenicity of b. hyodysenteriae could in analogy with yersinia pestis  <cit> , be a result of the acquisition of a plasmid.

the gene content of the different classes of accessory genes is under the influence of hgt. here we outlined a mechanism for hgt between classes that involves gene rearrangements involving bacteriophages with broad tropism. our data also suggest cross genus hgt events could have occurred via the phages. these mechanisms need further studies if we want to understand the dynamics of the complete pan-genome of the species.

genome sequencing of more strains will probably reduce the numbers of unique and shared features even more. although we now have a markedly more confined list of candidate genes, the large number of annotations for "hypothetical proteins" among the unique genes shows that it is of great importance to study gene functions in order to understand species-specific traits.
