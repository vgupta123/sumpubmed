BACKGROUND
prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies , are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy  in cattle and creutzfeldt-jakob disease  in man. a key event in the pathogenesis of these diseases is the misfolding of the normal prion protein , to a modified, pathogenic form, termed prpsc <cit> . prpsc is the major, if not only, component of the infectious agent of tses and prpsc itself, or defined fragments of prpsc, including the synthetic peptide huprp106- <dig> have been demonstrated to be cytotoxic to many different cell types
 <cit> . however the exact pathways by which huprp106- <dig> toxicity is mediated remain to be fully elucidated. huprp106- <dig> has the ability to aggregate in vitro to form oligomeric fibrils that are insoluble, protease resistant and can aggregate further to form amyloid aggregates
 <cit> . effects of huprp106- <dig> on cells include aggregation of prpc in neuroblastoma cells
 <cit> , copper uptake inhibition in cerebellar neurons
 <cit> , p <dig> mapk activation in correlation with cell death in sh-sy5y cells
 <cit>  and an increase in intracellular ca2+ coupled with membrane viscosity in leucocytes
 <cit> .

previous reports have indicated that the pla <dig> signalling pathway is implicated in prion disease pathogenesis
 <cit> . pla <dig> isoforms have a predominant role in the central nervous system where they are involved in the pro-inflammatory response, membrane repair, trafficking, neurotransmitter release and apoptosis
 <cit> . the main role of the mammalian pla <dig> enzymes is the production of lipid mediators vital to activate signal transduction and inflammatory pathways more specifically they catalyse the production of free fatty acids from the sn- <dig> position in membrane phospholipids via hydrolysis leaving lysophospholipids as a remainder
 <cit> . pla <dig> enzymes can be divided into three main groups: extracellular, secretory pla <dig>  enzymes, cytosolic pla <dig>  that require smaller amounts  of ca2+ for membrane translocation and calcium-independent pla <dig> 
 <cit> . cpla <dig> does not require ca2+ to be catalytically active
 <cit> , however it does require the presence of nucleophilic ser- <dig>  in addition, phosphorylation by mapk, erk, pkc and camkii at the conserved residues ser <dig>  ser <dig> or ser <dig> can also increase activity
 <cit> .

the importance of pla <dig> in the pathogenesis of the neuronal degeneration in prion diseases has been indicated by the use of pla <dig> inhibitors that reduced prpsc formation caspase- <dig> activity and prostaglandin e <dig> production
 <cit> . in the present study the effects of the prp fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 106– <dig> of human prp, huprp106- <dig>  on the activation of cpla <dig> and other components of the pla <dig> pathway was investigated. as cpla <dig> has been reported to relocate to the nuclear envelope upon activation by the ca2+ ionophore a <dig> in cho cell lines
 <cit> , the hypothesis that exposure to huprp106- <dig> leads to changes in cpla <dig> distribution within neurons was assessed. in addition, a previously untested pla <dig> inhibitor, palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone  was investigated for its effects on huprp106-126-induced cpla <dig> activation and neuronal degeneration. this pla <dig> inhibitor prevented translocation of pla <dig> and subsequent synapse degeneration and neuronal death.

in the present study we provide important new insights into the position of cpla <dig> in the mechanism underlying prp neurotoxicity and implicate the involvement of the cytoskeleton in prion disease pathogenesis.

RESULTS
exposure of primary cortical neurons to huprp106- <dig> activates cpla <dig> and induces a novel relocation
the human prion protein peptide fragment huprp106- <dig> was used to investigate the effect of prp upon pla <dig> in primary cortical neurons. it is known that cpla <dig> is promptly activated within  <dig> hour by agonists including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  a <dig> and ionomycin
 <cit> , this was confirmed in murine primary cortical neurons via preliminary experiments , and therefore neurons were initially treated for  <dig> minutes. p-cpla <dig> was visualised by confocal microscopy using an anti-phospho cpla <dig> antibody against the serine- <dig> residue.

in untreated neurons a low basal level of p-cpla <dig> labelling in the nuclear region could be seen, however exposure to  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> resulted in a significant increase in the intensity of p-cpla <dig> labelling , indicating amplified levels of the enzyme . in addition, p-cpla <dig> appeared to relocate from the cell body to the neurites , an occurrence not previously noted in cpla <dig> activation. the effect of huprp106- <dig> on pla <dig> activation was amino acid sequence specific and dependent on the presence of prp, as the intensity and localisation of p-cpla <dig> labelling was not altered in cells exposed to  <dig> μm scrambled huprp106- <dig> peptide or in prp null neurons exposed to huprp106- <dig> . in contrast known activators of cpla <dig>  pma and a <dig>  induced p-cpla <dig> activation and localisation to the nuclear region in both cell types . this is consistent with previous studies which reported that cpla <dig> translocates to the er and nuclear membrane upon activation
 <cit> .

the effect of huprp106- <dig> on the cpla <dig> cascade was further analysed by measuring the release of arachidonic acid . cleavage and subsequent release of aa by cpla <dig> can be used as a marker for pla <dig> activity. primary cortical neurons were exposed to  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> or scrambled huprp106- <dig>  after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes pma and a <dig> induced significant -aa release  . in contrast, huprp106- <dig> did not induce -aa release above untreated or scrambled control levels. when incubation was prolonged to  <dig> hours, pma and a <dig> again induced a significantly higher -aa release compared to controls , and at this time huprp106- <dig> also induced a significant -aa release  . levels of aa following exposure to scrambled peptide controls remained comparable to untreated controls.

pacocf <dig> inhibits huprp106-126-induced cpla <dig> activation and neuronal damage
to examine the specific involvement of cpla <dig> in huprp106-126-induced cellular toxicity cells were pre-treated with the pla <dig> inhibitor pacocf <dig>  a known cpla <dig> inhibitor
 <cit> . primary cortical neuron samples were analysed by western immunoblotting and levels of activated and total cpla <dig> were measured. after exposure to  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> for a period of  <dig> hour and  <dig> hours, the relative density of p-cpla2/cpla <dig> was significantly higher than in untreated neurons  . in contrast, relative expression levels of p-cpla <dig> in neurons treated with  <dig> μm pacocf <dig> and samples pre-treated with pacocf <dig> prior to the addition of peptide for  <dig> hour were not significantly different from control samples. however after  <dig> hours, cpla <dig> activation was reduced markedly in samples pre-treated with pacocf <dig> in comparison to neurons treated with peptide alone .

localisation of p-cpla <dig> in the presence of pacocf <dig> was subsequently determined . incubation with huprp106- <dig> for  <dig> minutes resulted in increased p-cpla <dig> labelling in the neurites   as seen previously. in contrast, neurons pre-treated with pacocf <dig> showed a distinct decrease in levels of p-cpla <dig> to levels and location comparable to that of untreated controls . the increase in p-cpla <dig> labelling in neurons exposed to huprp106- <dig> compared to untreated neurons was still apparent after  <dig> hour  and  <dig> hours  . in agreement with western immunoblot data, cells pre-treated with pacocf <dig> showed reduced levels of cpla <dig> phosphorylation in comparison to those induced by huprp106- <dig> at all time points measured .

the effect of pacocf <dig> on -aa release was examined to determine if it would prevent cpla <dig> from accessing its substrate and inhibit huprp106-126-induced activation of cpla <dig>  cells exposed to pacocf <dig> alone released similar amounts of aa to untreated controls . again primary cortical neurons exposed to  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> for  <dig> hours released a significant  amount of -aa as seen previously in figure
2b. however, when neurons were pre-treated with pacocf <dig> and then exposed to prp peptide for  <dig> hours, only 35% of total -aa was released . interestingly, pacocf <dig> pre-treatment did not affect -aa release induced by pma or a <dig> 

to assess the extent of the role of cpla <dig> in prp peptide action the effect of pacocf <dig> on huprp106-126-induced cell toxicity was also analysed. the toxicity of huprp106- <dig> was measured via mtt assay and confirmed that huprp106- <dig> was lethal to primary cortical neurons, but only after a period of around  <dig> days . this was comparable to other studies using cortical neurons
 <cit> . concentrations of  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> did not significantly affect cell survival but  <dig> μm huprp106- <dig> caused a 70% decrease in neuronal survival . huprp106- <dig> scrambled peptide had no effect on cell viability. pre-treatment with pacocf <dig>  was protective cells pre-treated with  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm pacocf <dig> prior to huprp106- <dig> treatment decreased the amount of cell death to a 16% and 15% loss respectively .

further investigation of the neurodegenerative effects of huprp106- <dig> was investigated by staining neurones for the synapse-related protein synaptophysin. synapse loss is one of the signs of pathology seen in prion infection
 <cit>  and alzheimer’s disease
 <cit> . synaptophysin can therefore be used as a neurodegenerative marker for these disorders. cortical neurons exposed to huprp106- <dig> for  <dig> minutes and then examined by confocal microscopy showed no significant changes in levels of synaptophysin . however, longer incubations of neurones with huprp106- <dig> peptide resulted in a significant loss of synaptophysin labelling at  <dig> and  <dig> hours  . pacocf <dig>  in addition to inhibiting huprp106-126-induced cpla <dig> activation and aa-release, also protected against synapse damage with synaptophysin levels in neurons pre-treated with pacocf <dig> prior to peptide treatment being equivalent to untreated controls .

p-cpla <dig> co-localises with beta iii tubulin in neurons exposed to huprp106-126
as the translocation of p-cpla <dig> within neuronal neurites in the presence of huprp106- <dig> had not been previously reported the question whether huprp106- <dig> treatment leads to a potential re-arrangement of the cytoskeleton, as described similarly for prpc <cit>  was investigated. to examine the process by which huprp106- <dig> induced p-cpla <dig> translocation, neurons were labelled with a range of cytoskeletal markers, including actin, vimentin and beta iii tubulin. p-cpla <dig> did not colocalise with actin or vimentin prior to or after treatment with huprp106- <dig> . however,  <dig> % of p-cpla <dig> colocalised with beta iii tubulin before peptide treatment, and this increased to 54%  after  <dig> minutes exposure to huprp106- <dig> . colocalisation was predominantly in the neurites of the cells. cells pre-treated with pacocf <dig> before exposure to peptide had low levels of cpla <dig> phosphorylation and the average colocalisation of p-cpla <dig> with beta iii tubulin was 8%. in addition, colocalisation appeared to be in the nuclear region rather than in the neurites. the relationship between p-cpla <dig> and beta iii tubulin also appeared to be prp-specific.  <dig> % colocalisation was measured between p-cpla <dig> and beta iii tubulin after exposure to a non-toxic scrambled huprp106- <dig> peptide control  and  <dig> % colocalisation was noted in prp null neurons treated with huprp106- <dig>  both comparable to untreated control levels. interestingly p-cpla <dig> labelling in prp null neurons was localised to the nucleus after huprp106- <dig> exposure, indicating that prp could define the localisation of p-cpla <dig> within the cell.

discussion
it has previously been shown that pla <dig> could play a key role in the neurodegenerative processes in prion disease pathogenesis
 <cit> . the aim of the present study was to examine the effects of neurotoxic prp peptide on cpla <dig> activation and location in murine primary cortical neurons. exposure of primary cortical neurons to huprp106- <dig> significantly increased levels of p-cpla <dig> with subsequent release of aa prior to synapse loss and subsequent cell death. it was also shown that cpla <dig> translocated to a novel region of the neuron in a prp-dependent manner when stimulated by huprp106- <dig> this was not seen when stimulated by other pla <dig> agonists pma and a <dig> suggesting that this abnormal translocation was prp-disease related. the effects of huprp106- <dig> were prevented by an inhibitor of cpla <dig> 

the regulation of cpla <dig> is complex and involves a variety of cellular processes including phosphorylation of serine residues and an increase in intracellular calcium to induce membrane translocation
 <cit> . it is not clear how cpla <dig> translocates although shuttle proteins and attraction to lipids or proteins within the membranes have been suggested
 <cit> .

here confocal microscopy showed an increase in p-cpla <dig> after  <dig> minutes incubation with huprp106- <dig> but without apparent translocation to the er or nuclear membrane as described in previous reports
 <cit>  and as found using pma and a <dig> in this study. one explanation for this could be that prp peptides may be interacting with intracellular prp rather than glycosylphosphatidylinositol -linked prp at the cell surface and this may promote p-cpla <dig> to localise in neurites. prpc is usually anchored to the cell membrane via a gpi anchor
 <cit> , however transmembrane forms of prp, ctmprp and ntmprp exist that are localised to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane
 <cit> . indeed, the peptides used in this study contain part of the transmembrane ctmprp region
 <cit> . alternatively, the huprp106- <dig> may interact with prpc to cause clustering of prp-gpis
 <cit>  and create altered intracellular signalling resulting in p-cpla <dig> locating to neurites.

in this study colocalisation of p-cpla <dig> and beta iii tubulin after exposure to huprp was demonstrated. as huprp106- <dig> has been shown to bind directly to tubulin
 <cit> , the data presented here potentially indicate a direct interaction of huprp106- <dig> and p-cpla <dig> involved beta iii tubulin filaments. in line with that observation, prpc has been shown to associate with tubulin in porcine and syrian hamster brain extracts
 <cit> . this is in contrast to a previous study
 <cit> , which concluded that cpla <dig> co-immunopreciptated with actin.

interaction of prp peptide and p-cpla <dig> with tubulin could facilitate their transport to neurite and axon terminals to mediate the disease-associated synapse degeneration as axonal membrane proteins are transported via microtubules
 <cit> . the interaction of prp with tubulin has been related to the active transport of prp in cells, by anterograde and retrograde movement via a kinesin/dyenin mechanism in n2a cells
 <cit> , in hamster peripheral nerves
 <cit>  and in the entorhinal cortex of rats
 <cit> . therefore, any association of cpla <dig> with tubulin could bring it into close association with prp. indeed, p-cpla <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with prpsc in scgt <dig> cells
 <cit>  and cpla <dig> colocalises transiently with the murine prp peptide moprp in untreated neuroblastoma cells
 <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that there is a direct interaction of cpla <dig> with tubulin in the presence of huprp106- <dig> and endogenous prp.c any subsequent disruption of the microtubules could lead to induction of apoptosis
 <cit> .

the present study also supports previous reports that activation of cpla <dig> is associated with prp peptide-induced neurotoxicity
 <cit> . indeed the pla <dig> inhibitor pacocf <dig> inhibited cpla <dig> phosphorylation in primary cortical neurons even after  <dig> hours of huprp106- <dig> exposure. furthermore, only low levels of p-cpla <dig> were seen by confocal microscopy and colocalisation with beta iii tubulin was lost. this correlated with prevention of 3 h]-aa release and ultimately cells were protected against synaptic synaptophysin loss and neuronal death. this is consistent with published data where levels of synaptophysin have been found to decrease in brains of cjd patients
 <cit>  and murine scrapie models
 <cit> . the finding that pacocf <dig> did not appear to affect 3 h]-aa release induced by pma and a <dig> are consistent with a report that pma induced activation of cpla <dig> may not involve the ser <dig> phosphorylation site therefore the mechanism of pacocf <dig> may not effect pma and a23187-induced cpla <dig> phosphorylation
 <cit> . alternatively the agonist a <dig> has been shown to have membrane perturbing effects leading to non labelled fatty acid release, therefore the lack of effect of pacocf <dig> on 3 h]-aa release induced by pma and a <dig> could be due to a high amount of unlabelled material in the culture medium
 <cit> . pacocf <dig> pre-treatment inhibited the loss of synaptophysin, indicating that pla <dig> could be implicated in synapse degeneration and loss of synaptophysin. it also suggests that pla <dig> changes occur as an early event prior to neuronal death, again consistent with in vivo data
 <cit>  in which prostaglandin e <dig>  an end-product of the pla <dig> pathway was elevated in specific brain regions before the onset of detectable neuronal loss. activated microglia also precedes neuronal loss and is a pathological hallmark of prion disease
 <cit> . the neurotoxicity of prp peptides are greatly enhanced in the presence of microglia
 <cit> , however microglial cell contamination of neuronal cultures as measured by gfap labelling was negligible in this study therefore this is unlikely to have affected results.

the implication that pla <dig> changes are a preliminary occurrence prior to cell death is also compounded by the toxicity data seen in this study cortical neurons show a significant decrease in metabolic activity after  <dig> days whereas an increase in p-cpla <dig> is seen after  <dig> minutes. it is likely that the increase in cpla <dig> phosphorylation encourage the cell into a cascade of intracellular signalling events which eventually lead to cell death. this is the first report of pacocf <dig> protecting neurons against prp-induced toxicity however the pacocf <dig> analogue arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone  has previously been reported to reduce prpsc levels in neuroblastoma cells
 <cit> . the results presented here are also consistent with earlier data showing an increased survival of shsy-5y cells treated with the pacocf <dig> analogue aacocf <dig> before exposure to huprp106-126
 <cit> .

thus cpla <dig> inhibition by aacocf <dig> and pacocf <dig> indicates a vital role for cpla <dig> activation in neuronal death, and indicates a potential role for the use of cpla <dig> inhibitors for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. pacocf <dig> and aacocf <dig> are both trifloromethyl ketone analogues of fatty acids
 <cit> ; aacocf <dig> inhibits cpla <dig> by binding to its active site
 <cit>  and it is likely that its analogue pacocf <dig> acts in a similar way. as pla2-induced aa release causes free oxygen radical release membrane disruption
 <cit>  and subsequent cellular damage, the neuroprotective action of pacocf <dig> and other pla <dig> inhibitors could be through inhibition of these events, and/or through disrupting colocalisation of prpsc, p-cpla <dig> and beta iii tubulin, by attaching to the active site of cpla <dig>  whether cpla <dig> is activated via direct cell exposure to neurodegenerative peptides or is due to a secondary event remains to be investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence that neurotoxicity resulting from exposure to prion peptide huprp106- <dig> is dependent on cpla <dig> phosphorylation and a novel translocation to neurites coupled with an interaction with beta iii tubulin. inhibition of cpla <dig> activation provides protection to neurons from prp peptide induced synapse damage and cell death. taken together these findings suggest a vital role for cpla <dig> in the progress of neurodegeneration caused by prion peptides.
