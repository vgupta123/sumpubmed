BACKGROUND
candidate gene approach has been proven to be an extremely powerful and effective method for studying the genetic architecture of complex traits. this approach is, however, criticized for non-replication of results when followed up in subsequent association studies. traditional candidate gene approach is also greatly limited by its reliance on the priori knowledge about the physiological, biochemical or functional aspects of possible candidates, and unfortunately, the detailed molecular anatomy of most complex traits still remains veiled. such limitation results in a fatal information bottleneck, and comparative genomics serves as an extended strategy to solve the problem of information bottleneck. this strategy makes the utility of cross-species approach to characterize the effect of putative candidate genes  <cit> .

to date, several comparative analysis studies of human and pig on obesity-related traits have confirmed the human obesity genes affecting fatness traits of pigs . pig is an exceptional biomedical model related to energy metabolism and obesity in humans  <cit> . it shares many physiological similarities with humans, making it an optimal species for preclinical experimentation as well  <cit> . especially, the back-fat thickness  of pig is closely related to total body fat so that the study of this trait can provide a unique approach to understanding the causes of human obesity  <cit> . fontanesi et al. found association of an snp in fto with intermuscular fat deposition in italian duroc pigs, confirmed in a later study by themselves and by a recent study of fan et al.  <cit> . on the other hand, du and collaborators found association between tcf7l <dig>  one of type  <dig> diabetes genes, and bft  <cit> . nowacka-woszuk et al. mapped  <dig> candidate genes in the pig genome and found most of them were located within known quantitative trait loci  to confirm the association with pig fatness traits  <cit> .

nevertheless, published comparative studies still do not break the barrier of information bottleneck, because it starts with presumed biology of one species and applies it to another species. thus, we previously conducted local genomic de novo sequencing of a porcine qtl region affecting fatness traits to carry out snp association study for bft and related the result to human association study of subscapular skinfold thickness . this study allowed us to expand the qtl results observed in pig to human common forms of obesity, but it still is a hypothesis-driven genetic approach as it only considered known qtl region instead of the genome. in order to overcome the lack of thoroughness and inclusiveness that candidate gene approach is criticized for, we conducted the genome-wide comparative studies on common form of obesity traits.

our study is also an integrated analysis, as it adopts the concept of the population-based heritability estimates which can provide a valuable metric of available genetic risk information  <cit> . gcta  tool implements the method of estimating variance explained by all snps and extends the method to partition the genetic variance onto each of the chromosomes. by fitting the effects of all the snps as random effects in a mixed linear model , this tool partially unveil the “missing heritability” problem caused by the inability to detect a large number of common variants with small effects and rare variants with large effects  <cit> .

we integrated heritability analysis and comparative genomics strategy to both identify causal genetic factors in the pig genome and to expand the knowledge of genetic risk factors predisposing to common forms of obesity in humans. combined strategy would provide a more powerful comprehensive means to counter the criticism of candidate gene studies.

the prevalence of obesity has increased greatly; it has tripled in the last five decades in america, and over  <dig> million people are obese  <cit> . the amount of fat in the body, adiposity, is regulated as the process of energy homeostasis, controlled by circulating signals related to the size of the fat mass  integrated with signals from the gastrointestinal system . adiposity signals are connected through central autonomic pathways to centers that process satiety signals such as cholecystokinin . these integrated signals are known to regulate the meal size and body fat  <cit> . obesity can cause various healthcare problems, including type  <dig> diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, etc.  <cit>  for instance, it can lead to the development of insulin resistance, one of the reasons for pancreatic islet β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in progression to impaired glucose tolerance, followed by the increased risk of type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> .

due to the considerable evidence that obesity, the worldwide epidemic, is highly heritable  <cit> , numerous studies including genome-wide association studies  have elucidated much of genetic architecture of obesity. despite extensive efforts to the search of obesity at gene and nucleotide levels, considering the substantial heritability estimate of  <dig> to 70%  <cit> , further research is still needed. to this aim, we analyzed obesity related traits of human and pig on genome-wide scale in cross-species approach to identify potential genes susceptible to human obesity disease. we present results of our combined approach of comparative and chromosomal heritability estimate analysis in an effort to elucidate the genetic basis of human obesity.

methods
sequence data
we used the us national center for biotechnology information  site as the source of the h. sapiens genomic sequence  and sscrofa <dig>  for pig  genome.

alignment strategy
the pig genome was mapped onto the human genome, using a large-scale alignment tool, last  <cit> . the chromosomal summary of autosomal pig snps mapped onto sscrofa <dig>  is described in . we used the default dna scoring scheme: match score of  <dig>  mismatch cost of  <dig>  cost of  <dig> for gap, and gap extension cost of  <dig>  the minimum alignment score was set at  <dig>  using the sorted alignments , we finally proceeded to “maf-cull” step to remove redundant alignments. the synteny map was drawn with circos software  <cit>  using bundling links function. we only considered autosomal chromosomes for this study, and the number of syntenic snps of pig and human by each chromosome is described in .

genotype
the genomic dnas of pig were genotyped on the illumina porcine 60 k snp beadchip. we discarded the markers with low maf , significant deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium , and low genotype call rate . this quality-control process left  <dig>  autosomal snps. the snp probes were mapped on sus scrofa genome  <dig>  from ncbi ftp using blat  <cit> .

using the synteny information provided by last alignment tool, we filled each human chromosome regions with corresponding dna segments of pig and their defined snps. therefore, we defined the pig genome in human chromosome level.

the genomic dnas of human were genotyped on the affymetrix genome-wide human snp array  <dig>  containing  <dig>  snps. markers  with high missing gene call rate , low maf  and significant deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  were excluded, leaving a total of  <dig>  markers to be examined in  <dig>  individuals.

phenotype
we analyzed inbred berkshire population, and a total of  <dig> meat quality traits were measured. traits include back-fat thickness, carcass weight, meat ph, meat color, muscle shear force, drip loss, heat loss, water holding capacity, and intramuscular fat content, etc. the back-fat thickness, which we used for this specific study, was measured between the 10th and 11th rib. the phenotype  was adjusted by the age effect using the linear model of y = b <dig> + b <dig> × age + e, and then we standardized the residuals to z-scores, in each sex group separately. we used the age data  at the time of slaughter. after excluding samples that do not have age information, we examined in  <dig> samples.

the subscapular skinfold thickness  was also adjusted by age and standardized in each gender and area group . subscapular skinfold thickness is a measurement for upper body fat distribution. it is measured just below the angle of the left scapula with the fold either in a vertical line or slightly inclined  <cit> . the sampling base for both cohorts is in gyeonggi province, close to the capital of the republic of korea. we used the data of korean cohorts  of  <dig>  individuals aged  <dig> to  <dig> and analyzed  <dig>  samples that had sub phenotype data available.

gcta & gwas
we used the gcta tool  <cit>  to calculate heritability for sub and bft. we calculated the genetic relationship matrix  between all pairs of samples using all the autosomal snps by “make-grm” option. we then estimated the variance of genetic component, or heritability, for each trait by restricted maximum likelihood analysis. we also estimated variance explained by each chromosome using joint analysis .

linear regression analysis was performed in an additive model with the data adjusted by sex and age using plink-linear option  <cit> . gwas have important limitations, such as the potential for false-positive and false-negative results and for biases related to selection of study participants and genotyping errors  <cit> . hence, we may need to be careful to interpret single gwa result. for these factors taken into consideration, we investigated markers significantly identified commonly from both human and pig, although pig data had its own limitations of relatively small population size and low number of snps. the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>  was used to determine gene-disease association  <cit> .

RESULTS
we mapped the pig genome onto the human genome using the alignment tool  and found the syntenic region; the pig chromosomes are rearranged in human chromosome scale. the synteny map represents  <dig> and  <dig> autosomal chromosomes of human and pig . syntenic regions of each chromosome of each species are linked with same bundle color. this result is corroborated by previous work of cytogenetic map  <cit> . for our analysis later, we mention briefly here that human chromosome  <dig> is syntenic to pig chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> mostly.


we then estimated the heritability of bft of pig and sub of human on each chromosome by snps, using gcta tool   <cit> . out of  <dig>  autosomal snps for  <dig> pig samples, we used  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  snps from a total of  <dig>  snps for  <dig>  korean cohorts. we observed a significant positive correlation between chromosomal variance of bft of pig and sub of human . although the correlation was not perfect , according to williams  <cit> , a correlation coefficient between  <dig>  and  <dig>  is considered as a substantial relationship. we also found a significant positive slope . these sufficiently indicated that the chromosomes that explain higher variance on pig trait tend to have higher heritability estimates for human trait as well. especially, chromosome  <dig>  seemed to be the most important chromosome in affecting the obesity risk from both populations, leaving detailed analysis on chromosome  <dig> 


considering the significantly correlated genetic contribution to obesity between human and pig, we performed gwas and extracted  <dig> common genes detected from significant snps achieving a nominal p-value <  <dig>  . we found that common genes evidently caused obesity-related diseases such as blood pressure and type  <dig> diabetes  enriched by david  <cit> . the genes included the fat mass and obesity associated gene fto with corresponding snps of rs <dig>  on human chromosome 16; h3ga <dig> and inra <dig>  for pig on chromosome  <dig>  this gene encodes for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent nucleic acid demethylase of which expression in the brain seems regulated by feeding and fasting, and it is associated with increased lipolytic activity in adipocytes  <cit> . another major obesity gene gnpda <dig> was associated with both traits . these demonstrate that conserved genetic regions of two species maintain the function to alter the level of obesity. as we look closely to each population, especially for berkshire, we identified additional variants in the genes associated with obesity, evidenced from multiple studies: rasal <dig>  npc <dig>  insig <dig> .


the numerous genes found to be associated to obesity or obesity-related diseases from previous studies still contribute only a small fraction of the variance, meaning that obesity genetics still awaits further discovery. from figure  <dig>  we noted that chromosome  <dig> was the most important chromosome in explaining the variance of this trait. therefore, we hypothesize that chromosome  <dig> plays a major role to the risk of obesity. the previous studies have found several obesity genes on chromosome  <dig> including tmem <dig>  pomc, gckr, and insig <dig> <cit> . our study could not detect these genes via gwas as some of which are not in syntenic regions to be analyzed. however, we observed the similar peak patterns of graphical summary of genome-wide association results between two species . although the plot was not dense enough, especially for back-fat thickness of pig due to relatively small number of syntenic markers, there were some regions that showed some similarities. this implies that human chromosome  <dig> and pig chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have conserved regions highly responsible for the level of obesity. we found the common nearest genes from variants reaching the significant threshold of p <  <dig>  . all the variants were located in intron region. here we applied a more stringent threshold to present obesity genes with higher statistical significance. we suggest obesity candidate genes such as mrpl <dig>  pard3b, and erbb <dig> with evidence of association with type  <dig> diabetes. also, hypertension and sudden cardiac arrest revealed to be affected by common significant genes on chromosome 2: stk <dig> and znf385b. further evaluation of these results may help researchers to elucidate the genetic predisposition to obesity, a major threat to the public health.

measurement error in assessing skinfold thickness in human may be considerably large, and this likely resulted in lower statistical power than that for pigs  <cit> . because we only analyzed the sytenic regions of the genome of each species with limited sample size, we had the increased sampling error for the heritability estimate and the reduced power of a conventional gwas. also, the size of linkage disequilibrium for pig is known to be much larger than that for human  <cit> , and this can be a confounding effect when detecting causal variants for pig. finally, the sequence difference among species especially on nonconding regions is huge that prospective snps might not have been identified  <cit> .

racial differences in genetic effects for complex traits are frequently debated in clinical and molecular research  <cit> , and thus our research may have resulted differently if european cohorts were considered instead of koreans. as much of the work in gwas has focused on european populations, extending gwas to different populations may provide new discoveries. in addition, various fat-related traits, including bmi of human and intramuscular fat content of pig, can be evaluated for this type of comparative studies; however, in order to make direct comparison between two species of common traits possible, we focused our research specifically on subscapular skinfold thickness and back-fat thickness.

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates a new approach of comparative study as it adopts the concept of an important parameter in genetics, heritability. heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variation that is attributed to genetic components and thus provides insights into the biological significance of a certain trait. we observed that human chromosome  <dig>  explained the largest proportion of heritability for common obesity traits. therefore, we hypothesized that chromosome  <dig> is crucial for remained complexities of genetic architecture of obesity. based on this knowledge, we further investigated this chromosome to suggest candidate markers and genes that possibly control obesity.
