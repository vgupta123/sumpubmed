BACKGROUND
mountainous areas are hotspots of biodiversity and endemism , and headwater streams are increasingly recognized for their contribution to freshwater biodiversity . in europe, the alps have strongly influenced the evolution of many taxa, acting as a barrier or refuge for populations during climatic fluctuations  <cit> . pleistocene glaciations are recognized as important promoters of population divergence and ultimately speciation through repeated isolation in allopatric refugia, increasing speciation rates in a variety of organisms . however, the role of recent glaciations in speciation has also been largely debated , and a number of studies favor a model of constant diversification rate during the quaternary ice ages .

the processes that drive speciation in aquatic insects remain poorly understood, despite the significant contribution of aquatic insect﻿s to global insect diversity  <cit> . several studies of aquatic insects have uncovered evidence for the important influence of glaciations on divergence patterns at the level of both populations  and species . in mayflies , population divergence within particular species has often been interpreted to result from their separation into distinct refugia during the pleistocene . although some authors have suggested that pleistocene glaciations promoted mayfly speciation in the palearctic  <cit>  and australasia  <cit> , extensive analyses of speciation rates during the quaternary are lacking. earlier workers proposed that the ancestral position of cold-adapted aquatic insect lineages was in headwaters, with subsequent downstream diversification into warmer waters . this headwater origin hypothesis has been supported by more recent studies of european caddisflies   <cit> , and in some, but not all, lineages of tropical diving beetles  in new guinea  <cit> . in contrast, there was no support for the hypothesis in a study of tropical heptageniid mayflies  in madagascar  <cit> . findings to date suggest that the headwater origin hypothesis requires further testing and refinement with additional phylogenetic studies.

rhithrogena eaton,  <dig>  is a predominantly holarctic mayfly genus  <cit> . highest rhithrogena species diversity is found in the palaearctic  <cit> , with a few species in northern neotropical and oriental regions  <cit> . it is the second-most species-rich mayfly genus, with  <dig> recognized species to date  <cit> ,  <dig> of which have been recorded in europe  <cit> . european species are particularly diverse in the alpine region, with more than  <dig> described species, half of which are thought to be local endemics. rhithrogena immature stages are often an abundant and diverse component of the benthic invertebrate community, and are routinely used as bio-indicators of water quality  <cit> . they inhabit most types of running waters, from large floodplain rivers to small and mountainous headwater streams. however, many species are cold-tolerant, with larvae living in fast-flowing, well-oxygenated streams and rivers  <cit> , suggesting that adaptation to such environmental conditions may have played an important role in their diversification in the alps.

the identification of many european rhithrogena species remains challenging because of a lack of reliable morphological characters in both flying adults and aquatic immature stages . a recent study of european species membership using one mitochondrial  and one nuclear  gene fragment highlighted the occurrence of several cryptic species within the genus  <cit> . phenotypic plasticity, convergence, or local adaptation could explain such ambiguities , as could a recent origin of species and incomplete morphological differentiation. rhithrogena species are arranged into several “species groups”  that are themselves easily identifiable. although vuataz et al.  <cit>  recovered five of six studied species groups to be monophyletic, relationships within and among species groups remained unclear.

here we used two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene regions to reconstruct a species-level phylogeny of european alpine rhithrogena. our first aim was to resolve the relationships among rhithrogena species and species groups, where a previous phylogeny showed insufficient resolution. we then determined whether their origin, diversification and changes in speciation rates could be linked to paleoclimatic events, and whether a phylogeny of rhithrogena provides support for a headwater origin hypothesis in the european alps.

methods
sampling and sequencing
larval rhithrogena were collected from streams between march  <dig> and may  <dig> at  <dig> localities in the european alps  and from additional localities in the pyrenees and corsica , the jura mountains , the apennine mountains and sardinia , the bohemian forest and the sudetes mountains , the apuseni mountains , the occidental carpathians , the dinarides , the cambrian , and the kroumir mountains . individuals were preserved in pure ethanol in the field, and stored in the laboratory at -20 °c in fresh pure ethanol. ventral-, dorsal- and lateral-view photographs of each individual were taken prior to dna extraction as described in vuataz et al.  <cit> . for phylogenetic analysis, we first chose one representative from each of the  <dig> gmyc species reported in vuataz et al.  <cit> . of these,  <dig> were vouchers from vuataz et al.  <cit> , and four were newly sequenced for this study. seven additional specimens were then included, based on morphological and mt evidence  that they were distinct species not included in vuataz et al.  <cit> . in each case, we selected individuals 1) with the most available sequence data in order to obtain a data matrix that was as complete as possible, and 2) sampled from type localities  when available .fig.  <dig> map of sampling localities from which rhithrogena individuals were collected. red circles indicate newly sampled localities; black squares indicate data from vuataz et al.  <cit> 



for all individuals, five gene fragments were sequenced for phylogenetic analyses: mt cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  and the large ribosomal subunit 16s rrna; nuc phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , elongation factor 1-alpha  and wingless . cox <dig> and pepck were amplified and sequenced as described in vuataz et al.  <cit> . the other genes were amplified and sequenced as described in vuataz et al.  <cit> .

sequence alignment and models of sequence evolution
forward and reverse sequencing reads were assembled and edited using codoncode aligner v.  <dig> . <dig>  . heterozygous sites  were identified as double peaks within the chromatograms and were scored according to the iupac code. sequence alignment was performed using mafft  <cit>  as implemented in jalview v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . sequence alignment was straightforward for cox <dig>  16s, ef-1α, wg and the coding regions of pepck because there were no insertions or deletions other than a 1-bp indel in the 16s sequences. a length-variable non-coding  pepck section was detected using amino acid translation, with boundaries identified following the gt-ag rule . a total of 201 bp within the intron could be unambiguously aligned  and were retained for analyses. the remaining intron region was removed from the pepck alignment.

identical haplotypes  and genotypes  were removed from each alignment using collapse v.  <dig>   <cit> , and the number of polymorphic and parsimony-informative sites were calculated in mega v.  <dig>   <cit> . the best evolutionary model was selected for each gene fragment  following the second-order akaike information criterion  implemented in mraic v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  under the option using the models implemented in mrbayes. in order to accommodate different substitution rates among codon positions, we used partitioned models of evolution for cox <dig> and pepck . following the partition scheme from vuataz et al.  <cit> , we examined cox <dig> in two partitions: one with first and second codon positions and one with third positions ; for pepck, we used one partition with first and second codon positions and a second with third positions and the intron .table  <dig> sequence variation for each gene region and for the three concatenated matrices

tree reconstruction
our alignments were examined under both coalescent-based species tree and supermatrix  approaches. species tree reconstructions were carried out under a multispecies coalescent framework  <cit>  as implemented in *beast v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . as outgroup for all reconstructions, we used cinygmula mcdunnough,  <dig>  which belongs to the same subfamily as rhithrogena . the species tree reconstructions were performed using the haplotype alignments. for this, the genotypes of the nuclear gene alignments  were phased using the probabilistic bayesian algorithm implemented in phase v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with a cutoff value of  <dig>   <cit> . one site originally coded as ‘d’ was implemented as ‘n’. input and output files were formatted using the scripts from seqphase  <cit> . heterozygous sites that could not be resolved were coded as ambiguity codes and remained in the data set for subsequent sequence analyses. all matrices were re-aligned after phasing with mafft. the individuals were a priori assigned to gmyc species . as models of sequence evolution, we initially implemented the model combination selected by aicc . since this specification resulted in poor sampling of several parameters , even when running up to two billion generations, we used for each partition the model hky + Γ . the maximum clade credibility trees produced under both model combinations resulted in very similar topologies, which only silghtly differed in poorly supported terminal nodes  within the semicolorata group . we used a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock for gene tree estimation at each locus and a yule speciation-process prior with two independent runs of  <dig> million generations with sampling for each every  <dig>  generations. the two runs were combined in logcombiner v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with a burnin of 10 %, whereby all parameters reached ess >  <dig>  the maximum clade credibility trees were obtained using treeannotator v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  applying a burnin of 40 %.

for the supermatrix-based approach, bayesian inference  and maximum likelihood  tree reconstructions were conducted using mrbayes v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and garli v.  <dig>   <cit> , respectively. we first performed separate tree searches on mtdna  and ndna . after detecting no major incongruence , we ran a concatenated analysis using all five gene fragments. in all analyses, each gene fragment was used as a partition in addition to the cox <dig> and pepck partition scheme defined in the previous section. for each bi analysis, two independent analyses of four mcmc chains were run for  <dig> million generations sampling trees every  <dig> generations. the stationary nucleotide frequencies, alpha shape parameter of the gamma distribution, relative rate of substitution and proportion of invariant sites were unlinked across partitions, and the ratepr command was set to variable . two million generations were discarded as a burnin after visually verifying that likelihood curves had flattened-out and that the independent runs converged using tracer v.  <dig>   <cit> . maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference was performed with  <dig> bootstrap replicates, which were summarized in sumtrees v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . heuristic searches were used to find the topology with the best likelihood score. thereby, the searches were conducted using automatic termination, after a maximum of five million generations, or, alternatively, after  <dig>  generations without significant  improvement of scoring topology.

molecular dating and diversification
we chose a commonly used mt mutation rate of  <dig>  substitutions per site per million years , equivalent to  <dig>  % divergence per my  <cit> , to date diversification events. this is because no fossils, geological/paleoclimatic events or independent studies could be used to calibrate tree nodes for rhithrogena. this widely used rate  was calculated from studies of arthropods and is based on both protein-coding and ribosomal mt genes. our concatenated mt data set  was used for branch-length estimation using a bayesian relaxed  molecular clock approach implemented in beast v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . we initially used a gtr + Γ + i model of evolution for each partition, as selected by aicc . since this specification resulted in poor sampling of several parameters , we used a hky + Γ + i model for each partition, which was the second-best model according to aicc . a yule process was preferred because it provides useful tree priors for species-level studies  <cit> . the clock models and the trees were linked for the concatenated mt data set. the substitution models of evolution were implemented separately  for each of the three partitions , and substitution rate parameters and base frequencies were unlinked across cox <dig> partitions. all base frequencies were estimated from the data, the number of gamma categories was set to six, and a random starting tree was used. well-supported nodes  >  <dig>  and ml bootstrap support  > 80) of the concatenated mt phylogeny were constrained as monophyletic . for node constraints, we favored the concatenated over the coalescent-base phylogeny, because it was the best supported phylogeny overall . all other options and priors were set to default. two independent mcmc chains were run for  <dig> million generations and sampled every  <dig> generations, resulting in  <dig>  trees for each run. run convergence was verified using tracer  and the first  <dig>  trees were then discarded from each run as a burnin, whereby all parameters reached ess >  <dig>  log and tree files were combined using logcombiner v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , resulting in  <dig>  trees in the combined analyses. the maximum clade credibility tree was built with treeannotator v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with all options set to default.fig.  <dig> coalescent-based chronogram  reconstructed from the five-gene data set. species groups are indicated with green shading, including a photograph of a species group member. for each node, *beast bayesian posterior probability , mrbayes bayesian posterior probability , and maximum likelihood bootstrap support  values are given  only if posterior probabilities >  <dig>  and bootstrap support > 60



the diversification rate of rhithrogena lineages was examined using γ-statistics  <cit>  and a birth-death likelihood  analysis  <cit> . an important problem with empirical diversification analyses is incomplete taxon sampling, which could lead to a variety of misinterpretations of phylogenies . one recent advance for handling missing species is the corsim approach  <cit> , which is based on the simulation of missing splits under speciation/extinction models. to correct for incomplete sampling in our empirical rhithrogena phylogeny, we used the corsim approach to simulate  <dig> trees with  <dig> additional  species. this brought the total to  <dig> species, which corresponds to the currently accepted level of species diversity of the genus in europe  <cit> . we assumed a random sampling  because we focused on alpine species rather than selected species from each species group. the γ-statistic was calculated using the function gamstat in the laser v.  <dig> - <dig>  <cit>  package for r v.  <dig>  <cit> . values of γ >  <dig> indicate an increasing number of nodes toward the tips of the phylogenetic tree. the bdl analysis with two constant-rate models  and three variable-rate models  was performed using the function fitdaicrc in laser.

ancestral state reconstruction
to test whether european rhithrogena fit the headwater origin hypothesis with subsequent downstream diversification, we reconstructed the ancestral altitude range of the two species groups hybrida and alpestris using the current species distributions as raw data. the other species groups were not included in the ancestral state analyses for specific reasons: the semicolorata group phylogeny was poorly resolved , the diaphana group is mainly mediterranean and thus most species were not included in our alpine-oriented sampling, and all members of the loyolaea group live exclusively at high elevation. in the absence of published altitude ranges of rhithrogena species at the european scale, we used our own extensive sampling  to assign elevational distributions. for each species, we considered our minimum and maximum altitude records as a proxy for actual altitude ranges . subtrees of the hybrida and alpestris species groups were extracted from both our species tree chronogram , and concatenated ml phylogram . we then performed residual maximum likelihood  ancestral state reconstructions  <cit>  of elevation on both topologies using the ace function of the ape  <cit>  package for r, which assumes a brownian motion model of character evolution implemented for continuous variables.

RESULTS
data set characteristics
the concatenated data matrix of five gene fragments was > 99 % complete. there were no missing data in the cox <dig>  16s and wg matrices. missing pepck data resulted from seven sequences that lacked 3’ and/or 5’ ends or a small intron section . there was a single ef-1α sequence for which a small internal section of 11 bp was ambiguous. a total of  <dig> nucleotides in the nuc data set were heterozygous. the concatenated mt data set contained 59 % of the total variation, primarily found in the third codon positions of the cox <dig> fragment . most of the nuc variation  was found in the third codon positions and in the intron section of pepck. the percentage of parsimony-informative sites within each gene fragment ranged from 33 %  to 2 % . two individuals had identical nuc genotypes , whereas all individuals had distinct mt haplotypes.

phylogenetic reconstruction
all four reconstructions, namely the mt + nuc coalescent-based , the mt concatenated , the nuc concatenated , and the mt + nuc concatenated , produced five well supported monophyletic species groups:  alpestris,  diaphana,  semicolorata + rh. germanica + rh. sartorii,  loyolaea, and  hybrida + hercynia + rh. insularis + rh. nuragica. the only variation occurred in the placement of rh. sartorii from tunisia, the sole representative of the sowai species group included here . in the coalescent-based tree, rh. sartorii + rh. dorieri formed a sister clade to the semicolorata species group. in the mt concatenated tree, rh. sartorii was sister to the semicolorata species group. in the other reconstructions, its placement was equivocal. the alpestris species group was sister clade to the others in the mt + nuc coalescent-based tree, but all other reconstructions did not resolve relationships among the species groups.

species-level relationships within the alpestris, diaphana and loyolaea species groups were fully congruent in all reconstructions, with increased node support in the mt + nuc coalescent-based and mt + nuc concatenated reconstructions compared to the mt and nuc concatenated reconstructions. species-level relationships within the semicolorata species group were generally poorly supported in all reconstructions, but with rh. germanica, rh. dorieri and rh. sartorii well supported as sister taxa to the other species group members in all reconstructions. species-level relationships within the hybrida species group were weak overall in the mt + nuc coalescent-based, in the mt concatenated and in the nuc concatenated reconstructions, but were fully resolved and well supported in the mt + nuc concatenated reconstruction; the only exception was the equivocal relationships between rh. nivata and rh. dorieri, well supported as sister taxa to the other species group members.

dating and diversification
the root of our phylogenetic tree was dated at  <dig>  million years ago , with a 95 % highest posterior density interval  of  <dig>  –  <dig>  mya. this node age roughly corresponds to the oligocene-miocene boundary . most species group diversifications occurred in the middle and late miocene: semicolorata , hybrida , alpestris , and diaphana . the loyolaea species group diversification appeared notably younger, dated at  <dig>  mya , in the pleistocene. examined globally,  <dig> of  <dig>  speciation events  occurred between  <dig>  mya  and  <dig>  mya , broadly overlapping the quaternary glaciations . terminal nodes from this recent diversification include rh. diensis, rh. hybrida, rh. circumtatrica, rh. gratianopolitana, rh. beskidensis, rh. semicolorata, rh. taurisca, rh. puytoraci, rh. iridina, rh. picteti, and rh. fonticola.fig.  <dig> ultrametric mitochondrial concatenated  phylogeny  obtained using a relaxed lognormal molecular clock and a standard insect mutation rate of  <dig>  substitution/site/my in beast, and the corresponding ltt plot of the empirical data , with vertical axis  in logarithmic scale. for each node, estimated ages  are given. horizontal green bars indicate the 95 % highest posterior density interval. stars indicate lineages that were constrained to be monophyletic according to the mt + nuc concatenated phylogeny ; circles indicate pp >  <dig> . the blue zone represents a period of global climatic cooling trend, empty zones warming trends, following zachos et al.  <cit> . blue vertical bars symbolize the oligocene/miocene boundary glacial maximum  and the quaternary glacial cycles . species groups are specified above corresponding branches

ancestral state reconstruction
the ancestral state reconstructions of elevation indicated a trend of decreasing altitude ranges toward the present for the species tree chronograms and for the concatenated ml phylograms in the hybrida and alpestris species groups. for the ancestral species of the hybrida group, the species tree chronogram  indicated a mean altitude of 1276 m , and the concatenated ml phylogram  a mean altitude of 1343 m , suggesting an origin of the group in mid to high-elevation streams. for the ancestral species of the alpestris group , the species tree chronogram indicated a mean altitude of 735 m , and the concatenated ml phylogram  a mean altitude of 846 m , suggesting an origin of the group in low to mid-elevation streams.

discussion
species groups
several species groups within european rhithrogena have been proposed based on larval and adult morphology . the alpestris, diaphana, loyolaea, semicolorata  and hybrida  groups were recently recovered as monophyletic entities in independent mt  and nuc  gene tree reconstructions  <cit> . based on additional gene fragments, increased taxon sampling , and a coalescent-based approach applied here, these findings were confirmed. we also included rh. insularis from corsica and rh. nuragica from sardinia, both members of an additional putative species group, insularis  <cit> , but both were recovered here within the hybrida species group. the only other genetic analysis to date  <cit>  used allozymes and a genetic-distance tree to divide rhithrogena into only two species groups. our study included most species from the zurwerra et al.  <cit>  study and while broadly congruent, notably within hybrida and semicolorata species groups, there were important differences. specifically, zurwerra et al.  <cit>  grouped members of alpestris and hybrida with the loyolaea species group, as well as semicolorata with diaphana, whereas we found clear evidence for their separation.

rhithrogena sartorii, recently described from tunisia  <cit> , was thought to share morphological characteristics with the insularis species group  <cit> , although a more recent examination of mounted specimens and different characters, including the shape of the first gill plica and the spines on the upper face of the femora, related this species to members of the sowai species group . this group is well diversified in the mediterranean area, particularly the iberian and balkan peninsulas  <cit> , indicating rh. sartorii is a marginal representative. our mt concatenated phylogenies recovered rh. sartorii as sister taxon to the semicolorata species group, whereas the other reconstructions included it in the semicolorata group or were inconclusive. a phylogenetic analysis including more members of the sowai species group would help to determine whether the group is monophyletic, and whether it should be fused with semicolorata.

timing of diversification
for molecular dating, we used a previously estimated evolution rate of mtdna nucleotide substitution  <cit>  because reliable estimates of node ages are difficult to obtain for mayflies. the only known fossils of rhithrogena were described by demoulin  <cit>  from baltic amber ; however, their attribution to rhithrogena was contested by kluge  <cit> , who noted that heptageniidae genera are based on larval characteristics rather than the adult features used by demoulin  <cit> . geological events, such as island formation, are also problematic. our analysis revealed sister taxa on neighboring islands , but using the separation of the corso-sardinian microplate from the continent or the separation of sardinia from corsica as calibration points is potentially problematic. there is strong evidence for overseas dispersal in the two mayfly families examined to date: heptageniidae  <cit>  and baetidae  <cit> . although there is evidence for diverging rates between lineages , the commonly used mtdna rate we selected was broadly supported by papadopoulou et al.  <cit>  in a study of tenebrionid beetles using a number of geological calibration points from the mid-aegean trench.

our empirical tree indicated an increase in rhithrogena speciation rate from ca.  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya, corresponding to the late pliocene and early pleistocene. this period of time largely overlaps the quaternary glacial cycles, which are well known for having promoted lineage divergence and speciation in a variety of organisms . in contrast, our analysis using simulated trees to account for incomplete sampling of rhithrogena species detected a significant reduction in diversification rate at  <dig>  mya . this shift potentially results from the absence of intraspecific variation in our sampling , which included a single individual per gmyc species. alternatively, this shift could be due to a lack of recent species in our sampling, either because they occur in regions poorly coverred by our sampling like the iberian and italian peninsulas, or because the cox <dig> failed to detect the most recent speciation events. rather than any increase in diversification, the simulation approach indicated a relatively steady increase in the number of lineages over time, suggesting that speciation is relatively constant and ongoing, and that glacial cycles have not been disproportionately important. nonetheless, more than 50 % of the sampled species arose during the  <dig>  –  <dig>  mya period in the empirical tree, regardless of whether speciation rate varied significantly. species that recently arose include all members of the loyolaea species group, most of the semicolorata species group, and some members of the hybrida and diaphana species groups. a recent divergence between these species may partly explain the difficulty of finding reliable morphological characters for rhithrogena species identification  <cit> .

interestingly, the origin of european rhithrogena roughly corresponded to the oligocene/miocene boundary , which coincided with one of the three major climatic aberrations of the cenozoic: the oligocene/miocene glacial maximum  <cit> . this deep glaciation spanning  <dig>  my, followed by a series of smaller glaciations, which happened in a global context of climate warming, promoted rates of turnover and speciation in many groups, including mammals, birds, ostracods, and planktonic organisms . similar turnovers in a number of groups  were also linked to another major climatic aberration, the older eocene/oligocene glacial period  <cit> .

the messinian salinity crisis , a geological event that had considerable impact on the mediterranean flora and fauna , potentially promoted freshwater invertebrate dispersal between mediterranean islands, with subsequent population isolation after the rapid refilling of the mediterranean sea  <cit> . a recent cox1-based study  <cit>  found that genetic differentiation of several continental and insular mayfly populations coincided with the msc. the origin of the three insular endemic species included in our sampling also largely overlapped the msc period: rh. eatoni from corsica , rh. insularis from corsica and rh. nuragica from sardinia , thus supporting the important role of this geological event in the speciation of corso-sardinian mayflies.

using the currently recognized taxonomy would have resulted in species over-splitting because single gmyc species have up to four names . our use of gmyc species  was intended to minimize this problem. however, vuataz et al.  <cit>  defined four cases of potential over-splitting in the delimited gmyc species , which if correct would still leave ca. 50 % of species having diversified  <dig>  –  <dig>  mya. although several low elevation species from the iberian and italian peninsulas were not sampled here, most central european species are represented. our alpine sampling was extensive and included all described species, most of them from their type localities. we can thus be confident that our sampling provides a very good representation of the alpine diversity.

additional evidence for the accuracy of our gmyc species comes from the present-day distribution of sampled species. based on our sampling in the alps and other mountain chains in europe , several closely related rhithrogena species have distinct or adjacent  distribution ranges. based on our dating analysis, these species diverged from one another during the pleistocene. within the hybrida species group, the individuals from one well-supported clade  are distributed in the apennines , in a small area in the western alps , in the carpathians  and widely in the alps . within the well-supported loyolaea species group , sp  <dig> occured in the carpathians and the eastern alps, sp  <dig> in the central alps, and sp  <dig> in the western alps and the pyrenees. such present-day allopatric or parapatric distribution ranges are typically observed in closely related species or populations that diverged in separate refugia during the quaternary glacial periods .

ancestral habitat
the headwater origin hypothesis proposes an ancestral position of cold-adapted aquatic insect lineages in headwaters and subsequent diversification into warmer, larger rivers downstream . recently, statzner et al.  <cit>  and statzner & doledec  <cit>  found evidence to support this hypothesis using an analysis of mtdna and morphological characters from nine hydropsyche  species along the loire river , although node support was partly inconclusive. in contrast, vuataz et al.  <cit>  found evidence that lowland mayflies  diversified to more upstream  areas in madagascar, while toussaint et al.  <cit>  reported a complex combination of upstream and downstream diversification events in exocelina diving beetles  in papua new guinea.

our ancestral state reconstructions of elevation constitute the first attempt for mayflies of which we are aware, and provide additional corroboration for the original hypothesis of headwater origins. however, our findings constitute only a preliminary estimate of ancestral aquatic habitats, being derived from a phylogeny of ca. 50 % of the european diversity, and because our own sampling sites served as a proxy of current altitude ranges of rhithrogena species. two future improvements would verify our findings. first, including more species, particularly low-elevation species from the iberian and italian peninsulas that are lacking in our alpine-oriented sampling, would produce more complete phylogenies. second, collecting more altitude data at a broader scale, particularly for rare species that we could sample from only one or a few localities, would improve the accuracy of the altitude ranges.

interestingly, rh. nivata and rh. grischuna were the sister species to all other hybrida group members , and live at higher elevations than all of them. the distribution of rh. nivata ranges from  <dig> to 2400 m in switzerland  <cit>  and  <dig> to 1650 m in france  <cit> . rh. grischuna, which is thought to inhabit small to medium rivers, was only found above 1150 m in our extensive sampling. in contrast, most other hybrida species group members exploit a wide altitudinal range , or were sampled from lower elevations than rh. grischuna. similarly, the sister species to all other alpestris group members, rh. alpestris, occurs at a higher elevation than any other member of the species group, and immature stages inhabit headwater streams and small to medium rivers between  <dig> and 2300 m  in switzerland  <cit>  and from  <dig> to 2020 m in france  <cit> . in contrast, rh. landai  larvae inhabit only medium to large rivers between  <dig> and 700 m in switzerland  <cit> , although our sampling included three occurences between  <dig> and 1200 m; rh. allobrogica lives between  <dig> and 715 m  <cit>  and rh. eatoni lives exclusively in corsica from  <dig> to 1100 m  <cit> . the loyolaea species group is restricted to cold-adapted species living in high elevation streams , thus their ancestor was also probably cold adapted. it appears that the diversification of this species group is more recent  and that there has been no diversification into lower elevations. the semicolorata species group members were sampled at wide altitudinal ranges, with the notable exception of rh. germanica, an inhabitant of large floodplain rivers  that has become very rare  <cit> . the diaphana species group is mainly composed of mediterranean species  <cit> , the alpine ones included in our study being marginal representatives.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis of two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene regions, combined with an increased taxon sampling compared to previous studies, provided greater resolution and clearer definitions of species groups within european rhithrogena. while our coalescent-based and concatenated phylogenies produced very similar topologies, node supports from the concatenated approach were repeatedly higher, particularly within the hybrida species group. the simulation approach of estimating diversification rates indicated that european rhithrogena speciation is constant and ongoing, with the more recent half of the speciation events overlapping the quaternary glaciations . the recent origin and ongoing diversification potentially explain the morphologically cryptic characteristics of many european rhithrogena species. the previously proposed headwater origin hypothesis with subsequent downstream diversification was supported by ancestral state reconstructions in the hybrida and alpestris species groups, indicating speciation has proceeded in part via diversification into warmer and larger rivers downstream. testing whether this is a consistent pattern in alpine aquatic insects requires additional analyses of a broader range of lineages.
