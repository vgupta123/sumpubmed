BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional/translational control of gene expression is a powerful strategy for the eukaryotes to adapt to biotic and abiotic stresses. in particular, this process is regulated by various rna-binding proteins  that regulate several processes involving rna processing, mrna transport, mrna stability, and mrna translation through direct or indirect interactions with target mrnas  <cit> . many rbps have several conserved rna binding domains  to interact with target rnas; these are the rna-recognition motif , the k homology domain, the pumilio homology domain , and the double-stranded rna binding domain  <cit> .

the pumilio rna binding family proteins termed puf proteins have repeats of a conserved phd, which recognizes a highly conserved 8– <dig> nucleotide core motif including the ‘ugua’ tetranucleotide in the 3′ mrna untranslated region  to specifically regulate target mrna stability and translation. mutated key amino acids of this phd alter the sequence specificity of pumilio  <dig>  a human pumilio protein  <dig>  <cit> . most of the identified puf proteins are conserved throughout evolution in mammals, fungi, protozoa, and plants  <cit> . many puf proteins have been identified as essential factors for several aspects of development such as germline stem cell maintenance, synaptic plasticity, embryonic axis patterning, and mating type switching  <cit> . many approaches such as dna microarrays, bioinformatics approaches, and rna immunoprecipitation have been performed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and drosophila melanogaster to identify specific target rnas associated with puf proteins  <cit> . many rnas with binding motifs interact with puf proteins at different developmental stages and in different tissues. puf proteins may be involved in much larger and richer post-transcriptional regulation in mammals. however, it is largely unknown how plant pufs control post-transcriptional/translational processing by binding to their target 3′ utr transcripts, and their functions have been poorly analyzed.

recent work has identified putative mrna targets of arabidopsis pumilio  proteins, and a comparative analysis of plant puf proteins was performed  <cit> . these results demonstrate that plant puf proteins may also act as post-transcriptional/translational repressors through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, and their recombinant phd protein binds to the nanos response element  sequence within the 3′ utr of hunchback  mrna of the drosophila pumilio target. additionally, their putative target rna candidates are associated with plant growth and development similar to mammalian puf proteins  <cit> . some puf proteins affect rrna processing apparently without target sequence specificity. for example, analysis of apum <dig> knock-out plant phenotypes revealed that apum <dig> function is involved in rrna processing in the arabidopsis nucleolar region  <cit> .

we previously isolated an arabidopsis pumilio rna binding protein  <dig>  mutant as a susceptibility-reduced mutant to cucumber mosaic virus  infection and this mutant exhibits up-regulated apum <dig> gene expression  <cit> . apum <dig> has a conserved eight tandem repeats of phd but their function in arabidopsis is still largely unknown. thus, we analyzed apum <dig> gene expression patterns using a bioinformatics tool and found it could be up-regulated by biotic and abiotic stresses. in this study, we conducted loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies using apum <dig> transgenic plants to further elucidate the specific roles and regulation of apum <dig> under biotic and abiotic stress conditions. the results showed that apum <dig> functions as a negative regulator under salt, osmotic, and drought stress conditions although apum <dig> transgenic plants did not show any phenotypic change upon bacterial and fungal pathogen infections.

RESULTS
apum <dig> is a pathogen-responsive gene but does not affect susceptibility or resistance to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  and alternaria brassicicola infections
apum <dig> is involved in susceptibility to cmv  <cit> . an apum <dig> gene transcript analysis was performed via the arabidopsis efp browser to further elucidate the functional role of apum <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, apum <dig> was induced by biotic and abiotic stresses in the bioinformatics analysis. furthermore, apum <dig> gene expression was enhanced in the mpk4- <dig> mutant background compared with accession landsberg erecta  control plants . arabidopsis map kinase  <dig>  is a negative regulator involved in salicylic acid-dependent disease resistance. mpk4- <dig> exhibits enhanced resistance to biotrophs and increased susceptibility to necrotrophs  <cit> . based on these results, we postulated that apum <dig> might be associated with the biotic/abiotic defense response pathway. first, we confirmed whether apum <dig> expression is responsive to infection by bacterial pathogens such as pst dc <dig>  as a result, apum <dig> mrna expression increased upon pst dc <dig> infection at 24 h post infection  and started to diminish at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi . atpr <dig> was used as a positive control and was successfully induced upon pst dc <dig> infection . thus, we checked the possibility that apum <dig> might be involved in the pathogen defense response and could affect bacterial growth. however, apum <dig> transgenic plants  did not show changes in susceptibility or resistance in the pst dc <dig> growth assay . these data indicate that apum <dig> is not required for bacterial pathogen resistance although apum <dig> was induced upon bacterial infection.

next, we checked whether apum <dig> affected fungal pathogen infection. when col- <dig> plants were inoculated with a. brassicicola, apum <dig> mrna expression levels increased at the  <dig> and 48 h time points . pdf <dig> , which is a positive control for fungal pathogen infection, was induced by the a. brassicicola infection . we evaluated the necrotic lesion size in col- <dig> and apum <dig> transgenic plants upon a. brassicicola infection. the apum <dig> transgenic plants did not exhibit any significant increase or decrease in necrotic lesion sizes compared with those in col- <dig> plants . thus, apum <dig> overexpression or knockdown did not change the fungal pathogen growth phenotype, although apum <dig> is a fungal pathogen-responsive gene. these results suggest that apum <dig> is not associated with defense against pst dc <dig> and a. brassicicola infections even though apum <dig> expression response to bacterial and fungal pathogens.

expression of apum <dig> increases strongly following mannitol, salt, and aba treatments
we found that apum <dig> is a pathogen-responsive gene following bacterial and fungal pathogen infections. however, the function of apum <dig> was not associated with defense against these pathogens, although apum <dig> inhibits cmv infection by binding to the cmv 3′ utr  <cit> . furthermore, apum <dig> transgenic plants did not show enhanced or repressed pr gene expression  <cit> . these results might explain that apum <dig> did not directly regulate defense-related genes.

apum <dig> is significantly induced by abiotic stressors such as mannitol, salt, aba treatments  <cit> . we verified that apum <dig> expression increased rapidly in response to mannitol treatment in 10-day-old seedlings . the rd29a promoter contains both a dehydration-responsive element  and an aba-responsive element , which are two major cis-acting elements involved in aba-independent and -dependent gene expression, respectively  <cit> . rd29a was used as a positive control and was successfully induced by mannitol stress . to further investigate the effects of other osmotic stressors and aba treatment on apum <dig> expression, the expression levels of apum <dig> in 10-day-old seedlings treated with nacl and aba were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . apum <dig> expression increased gradually and strongly following nacl treatment . we also evaluated the effect of aba. as expected, apum <dig> gene expression was enhanced by aba treatment . rd29a expression was also increased by the nacl and aba treatments . these observations suggest that apum <dig> may play a role during the osmotic and aba stress response.

tissue-specific expression of gus in apum5pro-gus transgenic plants
a  <dig> -kb fragment of the apum <dig> promoter region was fused to the gus reporter gene, and this construct was introduced into arabidopsis to analyze the spatial expression of apum <dig>  apum5pro-gus expression was analyzed in the 10-day-old seedling stage of t <dig> transgenic plants, with strong gus activity in the root tip, primary root, lateral root, and shoot apical meristem region . although low gus activity was detected in leaf tissue, much higher activity was observed in the hydathodal cells . high levels of gus activity were also detected in cauline leaves, flowers, and silique ends . these observations confirmed results described previously  <cit> .

previous results showed that apum <dig> expression was highly enhanced under the osmotic stress condition , indicating that apum <dig> expression could be observed in the leaf tissue in the gus activity assay following osmotic stress treatment. thus, the apum <dig> promoter cis-elements were examined using athena, the arabidopsis promoter analysis tool  <cit> . the promoter analysis revealed that the apum <dig> promoter contains aba response elements  and myb recognition elements , all of which are cis-acting elements often found in aba- or environmental stress-related genes   <cit> . apum5pro-gus transgenic plants were treated with mannitol, nacl, and exogenous aba in soil to further investigate apum <dig> expression. after applying of nacl, mannitol, and aba, most of the leaf tissues showed strong gus activity and were activated in the entire plant vasculature . this was consistent with qrt-pcr analyses of the apum <dig> gene expression pattern during osmotic stress and exogenous aba applications . interestingly, gus activity was not detected in guard cells , whereas strong gus activity was detected in the hydathodes, trichomes, mesophyll cells, main veins, and vascular tissues . these results indicate that apum <dig> may not directly affect stomatal regulation through an aba-dependent pathway of stomatal closure and opening. in contrast, apum <dig> may affect the physical endurance of the plants under osmotic or drought stress via hydathodes and trichomes.

overexpression of apum <dig> leads to hypersensitivity and down-regulation to reduced susceptibility to salt and mannitol in arabidopsis
the above results demonstrated that osmotic stress and exogenous aba treatment up-regulated apum <dig> expression  and this result was consistent with apum5pro-gus expression under similar stress conditions . additionally, these results are supported by the apum <dig> promoter cis-acting elements analysis . these data suggest that apum <dig> may be involved in osmotic, drought, and aba sensitivity. germination and post-germination growth efficiency of apum <dig> transgenic and col- <dig> wild-type plants were examined when the plants were treated with various concentrations of salt or mannitol to determine whether the physiological role of apum <dig> in arabidopsis is associated with salt or dehydration stress. the germination rate of col- <dig>  35s-apum <dig>  and apum5-rnai plants was similar on the control 1/ <dig> ms medium plate . however, the germination rate of apum5-rnai line # <dig> and # <dig> plants was about 20% higher than that of col- <dig> on the 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 150 mm nacl, whereas no obvious difference in germination rate was observed between the col- <dig> and 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants . however, primary root elongation of 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants was hypersensitive in the 1/ <dig> ms plate containing 100 mm nacl . on the other hand, the germination rate of apum5-rnai line # <dig> and # <dig> plants increased about 18% compared with that of the col- <dig> plants on 1/ <dig> ms medium supplemented with 400 mm mannitol, whereas the germination rate of 35s-apum <dig> transgenic line # <dig> and # <dig> plants decreased significantly  by 7 days . primary root elongation of 35s-apum <dig> was also hypersensitive on the 1/ <dig> ms plate containing 300 mm mannitol . these results suggest that apum <dig> may negatively contribute to salt and dehydration stress tolerance.

fully germinated 3-day-old seedlings in normal 1/ <dig> ms medium were transferred to plates supplemented with 150 mm nacl or 400 mm mannitol to further assess the effect of salt or dehydration on growth of apum <dig> transgenic seedlings, and primary root elongation was monitored after 7 days. primary root elongation of the apum <dig> transgenic plants was similar to that of the col- <dig> plants under normal conditions . however, primary root length of apum5-rnai plants was longer than that of col- <dig> plants under the 150 mm nacl supplement condition, whereas that of 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants was shorter . this phenotype is thus concentration-dependent effect in root elongation of 35s-apum <dig> plants. in contrast, apum5-rnai transgenic plants showed enhanced primary root growth under the salinity stress condition . the primary root length of apum5-rnai transgenic plants was 14–15% longer compared with that of col- <dig> plants when the plants were grown on plates supplemented with 400 mm mannitol, whereas 35s-apum <dig> plants showed reduced primary root growth of 16–17% compared to that of col- <dig> plants .

we assessed whether germination and primary root growth were affected by an exogenous aba application. the germination rate of 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants decreased about 39% and 49% compared with that of wild-type and apum5-rnai plants following  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm aba treatments, respectively . primary root length of 35s-apum <dig> plants was shorter than that of the wild-type and apum5-rnai plants following aba treatment . these results show that apum5-overexpressing plants are more hypersensitive to dehydration or salt stress, suggesting that apum <dig> might regulate the abiotic stress response.

apum <dig> seems to be directly involved in the osmotic stress response. phenotypes of wild type and apum <dig> transgenic plants treated with salt were evaluated in soil to investigate the possible role of apum <dig> in the salt stress response. a high-salinity treatment resulted in symptoms on col- <dig> leaves such as chlorosis, leaf burn, and senescence as well as a decrease in leaf area compared with those in non-stressed plants  <cit> . wild-type and apum <dig> transgenic plants showed similar normal growth at the vegetative stage. however, 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants exhibited a slightly more shrinking phenotype compared with col- <dig> and apum5-rnai plants when irrigated with 150 mm nacl for 5 days . 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants showed significantly enhanced chlorosis, leaf burn, and reduced leaf area at 10 days, compared with that in col- <dig> and apum5-rnai plants . to further analyze the effect of salt stress, chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll a/b ratio were measured because chlorosis was enhanced in apum5-overexressing plants. chlorophyll content decreased but the chlorophyll a/b ratio remained unchanged in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants compared to those in col- <dig> and apum5-rnai plants . taken together, these results indicate that apum5-overexpressing plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress at the vegetative and primary root elongation stage, suggesting that apum <dig> may act as a negative regulator when plants are subjected to salt stress.

apum5-overexpressing plants are more hypersensitive whereas apum5-knockdown plants are more tolerant to drought stress compared to wild-type plants in soil
we further investigated whether apum <dig> transgenic plants showed an altered phenotype to drought tolerance. both col- <dig> and 35s-apum <dig> plants became severely wilted when water was withheld from soil for 14 days . however, down-regulation of apum <dig> by apum5-rnai resulted in the enhanced tolerant phenotype at the same stage compared with that of col- <dig> . survival rate was examined after re-watering the 14 day-water-withheld plants. approximately 77% of the apum5-rnai plants survived, whereas 11–13% of the 35s-apum <dig> and 58% of the col- <dig> plants survived . additionally, water loss rate of the wild-type and apum <dig> transgenic plants was measured in detached leaves. wild-type plants exhibited similar weight loss of detached leaves as apum5-rnai plants, whereas 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants had highly enhanced water loss rates . thus, similar to the salt stress results, apum5-overexpressing plants exhibited more drought sensitivity, whereas repressing of apum <dig> expression led to more drought tolerance compared with that of wild-type plants in soil.

altered transcription levels of abiotic stress-responsive genes in apum5-overexpressing plants under drought stress
a gene expression analysis of various genes was performed by qrt-pcr to examine whether the enhanced sensitivity of 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants to salt and drought stresses was accompanied by changed transcription levels of abiotic stress-responsive genes. the transcription levels of some abiotic stress-responsive genes decreased in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants under the drought stress condition compared to those in wild type plants . the putative apum <dig> binding site was searched in the 3′ utr region of abiotic stress-responsive genes to investigate the possible role of apum <dig> as a post-transcriptional repressor. we conducted this search because mammalian pumilio proteins directly interact with target transcripts containing the conserved ‘ugua’ tetranucleotide motif  <cit> . some of 3′ utrs of abiotic stress-responsive genes contained the conserved ‘ugua’ tetranucleotide motif . the 3′ utrs of significantly downregulated genes in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants by drought stress were re-analyzed and compared with the drosophila hbnre <dig> sequence. the ‘ugua’ tetranucleotide motif of the 3′ utrs was highly conserved among the most abiotic stress-responsive genes and hbnre <dig> . erd <dig> and abi <dig> transcript levels also decreased about 52% and 42% in apum5-overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants upon drought stress, respectively . however, erd <dig> and abi <dig> did not have the ‘ugua’ motif in the 3′ utr region . in contrast, kin <dig>  atmyb <dig>  aao <dig>  and rd29b did not contain the ‘ugua’ tetranucleotide motif and their transcript levels did not change significantly in 35s-apum <dig> plants upon drought stress . apum5-rnai plants did not exhibit a dramatic alteration in aba-response genes expression partly because apum5-rnai transgenic plants showed only 50% silencing levels of the apum <dig> gene and the effect may be similar to that of the heterozygote mutant . these results suggest that transcripts of some abiotic stress-responsive genes could be negatively regulated by binding of the apum <dig> protein in their 3′ utr regions.

apum5-phd binds to the 3′ utr motifs of abiotic stress-responsive putative target genes
an electrophoretic mobility shift assay  was performed to determine if the apum5-phd binds to the putative target rnas. genes that were highly down-regulated by apum <dig> and had a ‘ugua’ binding motif were selected. 32p-labeled synthetic  <dig> nucleotide rnas along with ‘ugua’ core sequence mutants were incubated with recombinant gst-apum5-phd protein. gst was used as a negative control. the emsa results revealed that gst-apum5-phd bound effectively to dreb2a, rd <dig>  cor <dig>  and rab <dig> but not to mutant rnas, whereas the gst protein did not interact with these rnas . furthermore, apum5-phd also showed strong binding affinity for hbnre <dig> rna . apum <dig> recognized the 8– <dig> nucleotide ‘ugua’ core motifs. these results indicate that apum <dig> binding affinity might be flexible for target binding motif recognition and this flexibility could contribute to multi-regulation of abiotic stress-responsive genes by destabilizing target mrnas. this result confirmed that the arabidopsis apum <dig> protein has rna binding activity and that the binding is important for regulating putative target 3′ utrs.

apum <dig> negatively regulates the rd <dig> and rab <dig> 3′ utr reporters
we found that the apum5-phd protein directly bound to 3′ utrs of aba-responsive genes in vitro. this phenomenon might explain that apum <dig> negatively regulates aba-responsive genes via binding to target 3′ utrs. we made reporter constructs with 3′ utrs of aba-responsive genes and expressed reporter constructs in col- <dig> and 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts to identify the function of this binding. the rd22-3′ utr reporter normally expressed gfp signals in col- <dig> protoplasts, whereas the rd22-3′ utr reporter showed reduced gfp signals in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts . next, these gfp signals were quantified by confocal lsm <dig> microscopy and imagej software. the signal intensity of the rd22-3′ utr reporter in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts decreased approximately 20% compared with that in col- <dig> protoplasts . western blot with a gfp antibody and rt-pcr analyses were performed to further confirm these data. both the gfp protein and rna levels of the rd22-3′ utr reporter in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts decreased compared with the levels in col- <dig> protoplasts . we also performed the reporter assay with the rab18-3′ utr reporter using a similar procedure. the rab18-3′ utr reporter in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts showed about a 45% reduction in gfp signal intensity compared with that in col- <dig> protoplasts . in the western blot and rt-pcr analyses, gfp protein and rna levels decreased slightly in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts compared with those in col- <dig> protoplasts .

previous results showed that apum5-phd also bound to the dreb2a and cor <dig> 3′ utrs , and these putative target rnas also contained the phd binding rna motif. thus, we expected that these reporters would also exhibit a decrease of the gfp signal in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts. however, the gfp protein and rna levels of the dreb2a and cor <dig> 3′ utr reporters were not affected in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic protoplasts compared with col- <dig> protoplasts . these data indicate that apum <dig> negatively regulates some aba-responsive genes by binding to 3′ utr post-transcriptionally. furthermore, rna binding motifs may be very flexible and other rna residues in addition to the ‘ugua’ core motif or rna structure could be important for the in vivo apum <dig> binding system.

discussion
arabidopsis and rice have multiple puf members  <cit> . however, the function of plant pufs is poorly understood. we performed an apum <dig> gene expression analysis using a bioinformatics tool to functionally characterize apum <dig>  which is related to the biotic and abiotic stress responses. apum <dig> showed increased expression patterns following exposure to biotic and abiotic stressors. we showed here that the arabidopsis puf protein, apum <dig>  negatively regulated some abiotic stress responsive genes and could be involved in the osmotic and drought stress response, although apum <dig> was not involved in susceptibility or resistance to bacterial and fungal pathogen infection . however, apum <dig> is a pathogen responsive gene upon bacterial and fungal pathogen infection . apum <dig> function may still be related to defense response regulation, although we did not show any definitive results for specific bacterial or fungal infections. similar to animal puf proteins, apum <dig> may regulate diverse target genes and be regulated by defense-related factors such as mpk <dig> .

aba-mediated plant immunity has been highlighted in terms of virus-host interaction. when tobacco mosaic virus  infects aba mutant plants, tmv-cg accumulation increases in the systemic region and tmv-cg could repress aba signaling by repressing wrky <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, cmv 2b, a silencing suppressor, interferes with aba-mediated signaling, and transgenic plants that overexpress cmv 2b exhibit enhanced tolerance to drought stress  <cit> . in contrast, overexpression of apum <dig> led to more resistance to cmv infection and slightly diminished turnip mosaic virus accumulation, although apum <dig> may negatively regulate some of the aba responsive genes  <cit> . this phenotype demonstrates that some plant viruses could negatively regulate aba signaling by regulating host proteins. however, apum <dig> defense function against cmv infection might not be directly connected with regulation of some aba responsive genes.

the apum5-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited reduced expression of some abiotic-stress response genes . furthermore, the core puf binding motif in the putative target genes is found at the 3′ utr , indicating that apum <dig> is likely to control these putative target mrnas by binding to the 3′ utr. puf <dig>  a yeast puf homolog protein, binds to the 3′ utr of cox <dig> mrna and regulates cox <dig> mrna by enhancing rna degradation  <cit> . interestingly, the cmv 3′ utr is not polyadenylated but contains the trna-like structure . apum <dig> does not affect the rna level of the cmv 3′ utr reporter  <cit> . thus, the function of apum <dig> during abiotic stress could be different from the plant defense mechanism against cmv infection because apum <dig> slightly affected reporter mrna level . this result indicates that apum <dig> function could possibly be associated with a putative deadenylase complex such as the mammalian puf-deadenylase complex  <cit> , although we showed that the putative ccr4-pop2p-not mrna deadenylase complex is not a apum <dig> binding partner  <cit> .

the putative apum <dig> targets, dreb2a, rd <dig>  cor <dig>  and rab <dig> contained ‘ugua’ core binding motifs in the 3′ utrs when compared with the hbnre <dig> motif. one of them, rab <dig> 3′ utr motif showed stronger binding affinity to apum5-phd protein compared to other motifs by binding even at  <dig> nm concentration . this that apum5-phd directly bound to these motifs in vitro, suggesting that the ‘ugua’ core motif confers rna-binding activity of puf proteins but other rna residues or secondary structures of the core motif are also important for puf protein binding affinity in vivo <cit> . in our results, abi <dig> gene expression level in 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants decreased upon drought stress . however, it did not contain the ‘ugua’ core motif in its 3′ utr sequence , indicating that apum <dig> might directly and indirectly regulate targets negatively.

aba plays a key role in osmotic tolerance by regulating aba-responsive transcription factors such as abi <dig> and abi <dig>  <cit> . aba also affects seed germination  <cit> . apum <dig> was highly expressed under the mannitol, nacl, and exogenous aba treatments . the seed germination and root growth experiments exhibited 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants were hypersensitive while apum5-rnai plants were insensitive compared to col- <dig> wild-type plants under osmotic stress and exogenous aba treatment of various concentrations . interestingly, 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plants were hypersensitive to salinity and drought stress in soil  although most aba-sensitive mutants show salinity or drought tolerance phenotypes in soil  <cit> . furthermore, some mutants exhibit development-dependent phenotypes to abiotic stress treatments. for example, areb <dig>  areb <dig>  and abf <dig> mutants do not exhibit aba sensitive phenotypes in single, double, or triple mutants during germination. however, these mutants show the aba-sensitive phenotype during primary root growth  <cit> . these data indicate that some mutants exhibit development-dependent phenotypes to exogenous aba application. in contrast, some arabidopsis proteins control the aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways to the abiotic stress response  <cit> . for example, osm <dig>  a snare superfamily protein, is important to osmotic stress tolerance and the osm <dig> mutant exhibits a hypersensitive phenotype during seed germination under an osmotic stress condition. the osm <dig> mutant plants also show increased sensitivity to salt and soil desiccation  <cit> .

an examination of tissue-specific activities of apum5pro-gus transgenic plants revealed high-level expression in roots under normal condition . furthermore, the apum5pro-gus activity assay showed enhanced levels under diverse abiotic stressors in hydathodal cells and trichomes . hydathodal cells are involved in secreting water  <cit> , and trichomes generally protect leaves by insulating them from heat, salt, insects, and water loss  <cit> . these expression patterns indicate that apum <dig> may be involved in this tissue-specific regulation and affect the salinity and drought stress condition, although apum <dig> was not expressed in guard cells .

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence that arabidopsis pumilio proteins have functionally conserved rna binding domain and activity. we found that apum <dig> is a defense-responsive gene and negatively regulated the rd22-3′ utr and rab18-3′ utr reporters at the mrna and protein levels. this negative regulation of apum <dig> could be connected to a more sensitive 35s-apum <dig> transgenic plant phenotype under abiotic stress. these data suggest that the apum <dig> protein could have dual functions in both transcriptional regulation and translational control by binding with target 3′ utr motifs and may have diverse functions during biotic stress, abiotic stress, and development. but still we do not know the real targets of apum <dig> in vivo. to understand the puf protein functions further, the real targets of apum <dig> should be identified by immunoprecipitation of mrna-apum <dig> complexes.
