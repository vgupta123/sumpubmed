BACKGROUND
public health protection requires the prompt evaluation of microorganisms in drinking water and in raw and processed foods to prevent outbreaks of microbial contamination. a broad variety of waterborne and foodborne pathogens are present at extremely low concentrations and are thus challenging to detect. whereas coliforms  <cit> , particularly escherichia coli  <cit> , rarely cause sickness, these bacteria are abundant in human and warm-blooded animal feces and are thus regularly used as microbial indicators of the co-contaminanting presence of enteropathogenic bacteria in water and foods supplies  <cit> .

the coliform group was vaguely defined from its inception  <cit> , primarily by the ability of bacteria to ferment lactose, and lacks taxonomical value. coliform bacteria are distributed among diverse genera, and different authors use different inclusion criteria  <cit> . nevertheless, coliforms are generally described as gram-negative, rod-shaped enterobacteriaceae that ferment lactose producing acid and gas. possession of the gene lacz, which codes for the β-galactosidase, is the most prominent feature of the coliforms, whereas β-d-glucuronidase, encoded by the gene uida, is routinely used to specifically identify e. coli. unsurprisingly, because uida and lacz are paralogs  <cit> , wild type β-d-glucuronidase also has a weak β-galactosidase activity, which is increased in some mutant alleles  <cit> . although lactose fermentation can be used to distinguish shigella spp. from e. coli, several shigella strains are able to ferment lactose after cultivation. this is explained by the presence of lacz in specific shigella genomes but the absence of lacy permease activity in culture  <cit> .

historically, the definition of coliforms has been primarily based on the techniques used for their detection. traditional detection methods rely upon culturing the samples on selective media and specific incubation conditions  <cit> . this approach allows cell enumeration but it is cumbersome, time consuming and fails to score viable but nonculturable  bacterial cells. in enterobacteriaceae gas formation from lactose is dependent on formic hydrogenlyase and easily inhibited  <cit> ; thus, detection of coliforms by gas production lacks significance. this method also lacks specificity, as aeromonas spp. can also ferment lactose  <cit> . furthermore, both β-galactosidase and β-d-glucuronidase are inducible enzymes and their activity is affected by incubation temperature and the growth medium  <cit> . consequently, both false-positive and false-negative bacteria interfere with evaluation. several current commercial tests involve specific enzymatic assays that utilize chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates for the improved detection of coliforms  <cit> . these methods are simple and rapid but their specificity is compromised  <cit> . although primarily limited to e. coli  <cit> , β-d-glucuronidase activity is found in other bacteria such as flavobacteria, and it is frequent in yersinia, salmonella, and shigella  <cit> . conversely, a high proportion of β-d-glucuronidase-negative e. coli strains has been reported  <cit> .

exponential amplification of specific dna sequences by pcr greatly increases the probability of detecting low concentrations of target organisms and reduces the time required to obtain results. while pcr cannot distinguish live from dead cells, it permits the detection of nonculturable cells. moreover, pcr may yield positive results with strains that, despite bearing a gene sequence, do not express the corresponding enzyme and thus lack the corresponding enzymatic activity  <cit> . multiplex pcr  allows for the simultaneous evaluation of several strains and the detection of internal controls. two sets of primers pairs, designed by bej et al.  <cit>  for the amplification of lacz and uida genes, have been used to test for total coliforms and e. coli in clinical isolates  <cit>  and in the upper gut contents of lindow man  <cit> . an mpcr assay was developed to target uida gene for the common detection of e. coli and shigella in milk  <cit> . fricker et al.  <cit>  analyzed water samples and found that only 70 % of the  <dig> coliform strains were correctly identified by these lacz primers, whereas five non-e. coli coliforms were identified by uida primers. these results indicate that developing alternative primer sets might be required for improved detection.

in this paper, we report a new strategy for differential bacterial identification by multiplex pcr. we wanted to combine, in a single assay, wide-range and high-specificity detection of both total coliforms and e. coli, respectively. to overcome the variability of lacz sequences, primer sets were targeted to the consensus sequence of an alignment. an orphan gene, yaio, was selected as the target for the specific identification of e. coli. the resulting amplicons, both in silico and in vitro, indicate that these probes are more efficient than those previously described.

RESULTS
yaio represents an alternative to uida for e. coli identification in silico
the gene yaio , selected as an alternative to uid amplicons, belongs to the e. coli orphan orfs  <cit> . nonetheless, yaio transcribes in both the exponential and stationary growth phases  <cit> , encodes a protein originally postulated by a bioinformatic prediction  <cit>  and was later found to be expressed and localized in the outer membrane of e. coli  <cit> . these results indicate that yaio corresponds to a bona fide gene and hence it might constitute an optimal target for specific e. coli identification by pcr detection. with this goal in mind, the oligonucleotide primer pair yaiof and yaior was design to produce a 115 bp amplicon .table  <dig> oligonucleotide primers used for multiplex pcr amplification



the primer-blast tool allows to check the specificity of pre-existing primers by combining local and global alignment algorithms  <cit> . therefore, we used it to compare the in silico pcr amplification of the uida primers designed by bej et al.  <cit>   with the yaio primer set using enterobacteria as the target genomes. the resulting hits were grouped by species or genus . unsurprisingly, because the shigella and e. coli lineages are very closely related  <cit> , shigella spp. hits were obtained for both primer sets. however, the specificity of the yaio amplification was higher 95 % of the positive hits  for yaio primers corresponded to e. coli, whereas only  <dig>  % of the hits  represented e. coli when the query primers were uida. ten non-e. coli strains rendered as hits with uida primers alone, one with yaio, and three were detected by both primer sets. these results suggest that although both sets are suitable for e. coli detection, yaio might represent indeed a superior target.table  <dig> comparison of expected uida and yaio pcr products by primer-blast analysis

lacz alignment and primer design
by performing a comparative analysis of an assortment of lacz sequences and developing new pcr primers, it may be possible to improve the accuracy of coliform detection. the dna sequence of the lacz gene from the e. coli strain mg <dig>  was used to perform a blastn search. from the resulting hits, a total of  <dig> sequences  were selected, and a lacz consensus sequence was obtained running clustalw  <cit>  software. considering the ambiguous definition of the coliform group, we did not restrict the sequences to historical coliforms but incorporated sequences from other enterobacteria . the statistical significance of the alignments was evaluated by comparing the pairwise identity  and and the bit-scores of the selected blast hits, revealing three clusters of sequences. although most e. coli sequences showed high identity , some possessed high bit-scores , showing a linear correlation between identity and bit-score , whereas others depict lower values . these groups correspond to “full” and “incomplete” β-galactosidase genes, respectively. strikingly, the bulk of the sequences from other lineages forms a third group with lower identity  and bit-score values. although the lack of lactose fermentation is commonly used to distinguish shigellae from e. coli  <cit> , some shigella strains harbor the gene lacz . in the analysis, blast hits were obtained for several shigella lineages, but the hits found for shigella dysenteriae and shigella sonnei coincide with the gene ebga, which is paralogous with lacz. these results indicate that designing pcr primers by using a lacz consensus sequence as a target might widen the spectrum of coliform detection. because similar sized amplicons are expected to work better on multiplex pcr  <cit> , we designed the primer set to produce an amplicon that was similar in size to but distinguishable from the yaio amplicon . therefore, lacz <dig> oligonucleotide primers  were designed to amplify a highly conserved zone of lacz, resulting in a 234 bp pcr product .fig.  <dig> alignment of lacz sequences and designing of lacz <dig> oligonucleotide primers. a clusters of dna sequences hits selected after blast using lacz from e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig> as the query sequence.  <dig> hits, with a minimum pairwise identity of 64 % with the query sequence, from different enterobacteria were aligned. the total number of sequences corresponding to each lineage is shown on the right in brackets. the area of each dot correlates with the number of hits from each lineage with the same identity and bit-score. b the consensus sequence of a lacz fragment  was used to design lacz3-f and lacz3-r oligonucleotide primers. consensus and primer sequences were obtained using clustalw and primer  <dig> software, respectively. the degree of conservation of each position in the logo sequence is shown by the relative height of each base. the lacz3r primer binding site overlaps with 3’ end of the laczb  primer 



specificity of e. coli and coliform detection using yaio, uida and lacz primer sets for multiplex pcr
the performance of two pairs of oligonucleotide primers, named here laczb-uida, developed by bej et al.  <cit>  for coliform detection by multiplex pcr, was compared with the newly designed lacz3-yaio primers . to this end, in vitro multiplex pcr amplification and in silico pcr simulation were conducted . in silico evaluation is utilized to elucidate the source of false positive and false negative results obtained with in vitro experiments  <cit> . pcr reactions were carried out with culture collection and dairy isolated bacterial strains  that had undergone total dna extraction. optimal thermocycling conditions with lacz3-yaio primers were determined by varying both the annealing temperature and extension time until best results were obtained . amplified dna was evaluated for the expected products using agarose electrophoresis  and compared with in silico simulations . simultaneous amplifications with laczb-uida were also performed following the method described by tantawiwat et al.  <cit> . although described as an optimized protocol, we did not note any improvements using such thermocycling setup .table  <dig> bacterial strains used in this work

overall, the lacz <dig> primers showed superior identification efficiency for e. coli and coliform bacteria. in agreement with the in silico results , most e. coli samples generated the expected pcr product with any lacz primer set, although the laczb band was very weak or repeatability was compromised  in several strains, whereas the lacz <dig> primers robustly identified all of the e. coli strains evaluated. interestingly, additional nonspecific bands were exclusively detected when amplification was performed with laczb-uida and the target was not e. coli. furthermore, although laczb did not produce the expected amplicon for several coliform lineages , amplification with lacz <dig> resulted in the expected 234 bp band with all samples except shigella boydii and sh. flexneri.

discussion
accurate molecular detection of e. coli is critical for the food industry because this bacterium is considered a primary faecal indicator. however, though it is widely assayed, neither β-d-glucuronidase activity nor uida amplification unequivocally identify e. coli . therefore, we wanted to design a pcr primer set non-redundant with the target of the enzymatic tests, i.e., an alternative to uid amplicons. to this end, we chose the gene yaio, which exhibits no significant similarity to any other real or hypothetical gene  <cit> . although orphan genes show a narrow distribution among e. coli genomes, with most of them being found in only a single genome  <cit> , yaio shows a wide within-species distribution. essential orphan genes would be ideal targets for the highly specific identification of all e. coli serotypes, but comparative genomics has revealed a clear conservation tendency of essential e. coli genes throughout the bacterial kingdom  <cit> . consequently, neither uida nor yaio are essential. nonetheless, the specificity of e. coli identification was higher with yaio primers . in agreement with our results, an evaluation of putative orthologs of e. coli genes revealed that yaio depicts a lower evolutionary retention index than does uida  <cit> , suggesting lower conservation and higher specificity of yaio. although bej et al.  <cit>  reported higher specificity with uida primers than determined in our study, fricker et al.  <cit>  found false-positive uida amplification using both h. alvei and serratia odorifera. several coliform bacteria  produced the amplicon expected for e. coli,  exclusively with uida primers, whereas others yielded amplicons of unexpected sizes with uida  or yaio . finally, dna from h. alvei, sh. boydii or sh. sonnei generated amplicons with both yaio and uida primers. though it is considered an orphan gene, yaio appears in some shigella strains. however, uida is present in the three shigella species analyzed . this is not surprising because genetic variation within the four species of shigella is encompassed within the range found in natural populations of e. coli. in fact, the shigella genus has been proposed to have evolved from multiple e. coli strains after the divergence of the o <dig> and k <dig> lineages  <cit> . our results support that the shigellae should more aptly be classified as pathogenic sublineages of e. coli that acquired virulence factors by lateral gene transfer  <cit> .

e. coli serogroup o157:h <dig> is the pathogen that is most commonly associated with foodborne disease outbreaks. however, o104:h <dig> is an emerging strain that was identified in the  <dig> german epidemic  <cit>  and could become more prevalent in the future. a + <dig> uida single nucleotide polymorphism has been used to characterize  <cit>  and differentiate the o <dig> serogroup from o104:h <dig>  <cit> . additionally, two frameshift mutations in the uida structural gene account for the absence of glucuronidase activity in o157:h <dig> isolates  <cit> . interestingly, these strains could also be differentiated by yaio amplification. in agreement with the primer-blast results and the absence of yaio , the o157:h <dig> strains did not render any pcr product with yaio primers . conversely, the o104:h <dig> strains harbor yaio and gave positive amplification on the primer-blast analysis with yaio primers.

detecting coliforms for food safety or epidemiological purposes requires an understanding of the manner in which genes are acquired and evolved because these processes may allow for the colonization of new niches and adaptation to their hosts and may possibly lead to speciation events. the lactose operon was likely acquired via horizontal transfer by unrelated bacterial lineages  <cit> , thus hindering the establishment of alternative targets for coliform detection. some lactose-negative strains such as sh. boydii and sh. flexneri lack lacz but incorporate the paralogous gene ebga  <cit> , which explains the difference between the positive blast hits  and the negative or inconsistent amplification . conversely, sh. sonnei, which is considered lactose negative due to inactivation of the permease lacy  <cit> , harbors the lacz gene, as confirmed by amplification with lacz <dig> . similarly, s. typhimurium and hafnia alvei, in which lacz has become a pseudogene, were identified by lacz <dig>  likewise, some lactose-positive salmonella strains, despite being considered non-coliforms, have been found  <cit> . all behavioral differences between the lacz <dig> and laczb primers pairs could be ascribed to the variability of the lacz sequence, notably at the 3’ end of the forward laczb primer , which binds to a site of low conservation in the consensus sequence of lacz . on the contrary, the binding sites of both lacz <dig> primers are highly conserved . additionally, the homology between lacz and uida sequences and/or the size of the amplicons  <cit>  might contribute to diminish the performance of laczb-uida.

CONCLUSIONS
horizontal gene transfer entails the high evolvability of bacterial genomes but hampers the specific detection of indicators such as coliforms. however, when the food industry involves complex bacterial activity, such as cheese production, the accuracy of the bacterial detection is crucial. amplification of dna sequences by pcr allows the detection of nonculturable or dead cells. the primers designed in this work, which target a conserved region of lacz and the orphan gene yaio, demonstrated superior detection ability when tested with laboratory collection and lactose-fermenting strains isolated from dairy samples.
