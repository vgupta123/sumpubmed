BACKGROUND
most genes belong to gene families which are derived through consecutive cycles of gene duplication. in animals, in the absence of horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication is the most important source of evolutionary novelty. while most duplications are of single genes, predominantly in tandem arrangements, whole genome duplication  is a special case whereby all genes duplicate simultaneously through polyploidisation. a wgd is followed by the loss of the majority of duplicated genes in the process of rediploidisation. over large evolutionary time scales, rediploidisation results in the formation of a paleopolyploid species such as saccharomyces cerevisiae. s. cerevisiae was shown in a pioneering study to derive from a wgd which took place after the divergence of saccharomyces from kluyveromyces  <cit> . pairs of genes derived from this wgd were shown to constitute about 13% of the yeast coding gene set  <cit> .

evidence has accumulated that single-gene duplications and wgds result in preferential retention of different functional gene classes. in particular, wgds may facilitate coevolution of interacting proteins, which are likely to resist single-gene duplication because of sensitivity to gene dosage  <cit> . ohnologs, which are defined as paralogs derived from a wgd, were shown to be enriched in transcription factors  and signalling genes in animals, plants, yeast and paramecium . however, no detailed analysis of the consequences of these trends for functionality of signal transduction pathways and signalling networks has been undertaken for any of the known wgd events in plants, animals or protozoans.

the modern version of the two rounds  hypothesis  proposes that two wgds occurred at the base of vertebrates after the divergence of urochordates and before the radiation of gnathostomes, most likely even before the cyclostome-gnathostome split  <cit> . recent genomic studies have provided overwhelming support for the 2r hypothesis. in particular, strong evidence was derived through sequencing and analysis of genomes of the human  <cit> , the fish tetraodon nigroviridis  <cit>  and the lancelet branchiostoma floridae  <cit> . an important methodological advance was made by dehal and boore  <cit> , who used an ingenious approach of mapping 2r paralogons by first identifying descendants of gene duplications mapping to the base of vertebrates by phylogenetic timing. furthermore, successful attempts have been made recently at the reconstruction of the ancestral vertebrate genome before 2r-wgd  <cit> .

herein we present the first systematic analysis of the functional consequences of 2r-wgd using state-of-the-art methods for inference of orthology and duplications. we establish a gene retention percentage for each wgd, analyse preferences in types of retained genes and tissue expression signatures, contrast trends detected for 2r-wgd with those observed for tandem or segmental duplications and view gene family data through the lens of signalling network evolution.

RESULTS
phylogenetic timing links the emergence of vertebrates with the greatest wave of gene duplications in the history of the animal kingdom
we performed a comprehensive computational screen of duplication patterns in the treefam database of metazoan gene families . table  <dig> shows the distribution of inferred duplication events associated with different taxonomic units . the highest number of inferred duplications was associated with the emergence of vertebrates , more than twice as many as for the second most abundant taxonomic unit, the bilateria . human 2r-ohnologs  were mapped to  <dig>  unique entrez genes , which were then placed on the genome defining a linear pattern of paralogons covering 83% of the length of human chromosomes .

aphylogenetic timing associates vertebrata and bilateria with the highest numbers of duplications . total associated with a given taxon is given in the last column and underlined. table rows are sorted according to taxonomic ranks . duplication numbers for all components of the eight selected pathways are given. gpcrs, g protein-coupled receptors; jak/stat, janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription; nuclear hormone receptors ; rtks, receptor tyrosine kinases; tgf-β, transforming growth factor-β.

next, we calculated the number of ancestral pre-2r  chordate genes as  <dig>  by analysing the topology of treefam trees. 2r-wgd was assumed to initially result in a fourfold increase minus genes lost later through rediploidisation. thus, the overall retention percentage was estimated as  <dig>  ÷  × 100% =  <dig> %. however, this was an overestimate, as  <dig>  tandem or segmental duplications, identified as nodes younger than 2r-wgd, inflated the number of ohnologs. one also needs to take into account the number of gene families without ohnologs, estimated from the total of human genes in treefam minus 2ros , or total of ensembl-predicted human protein-coding genes minus 2ros . the upper-bound estimate was therefore calculated as  ÷  × 100% = 30% and the lower bound as  ÷  × 100% =  <dig> %.

the number of duplication nodes which could be placed at the very base of vertebrates was  <dig> . an additional  <dig>  duplication nodes were children to these nodes, yet were still assigned to vertebrates by phylogenetic timing. these two waves of duplications, in close temporal succession, and of similar quantitative contributions, should be interpreted as differential signatures of two consecutive rounds of genome doubling of 2r-wgd, with similar retention rates .

gene duplication in the shared animal developmental toolkit
a key set of uniquely important conserved genes, known as the shared toolkit, control development in all animals. to better understand the evolution of the toolkit, we investigated duplication patterns of the eight key signalling pathways, namely, g protein-coupled receptors , receptor tyrosine kinases , wnt, notch, transforming growth factor -β, janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription , hedgehog and nuclear hormone receptors. these duplication patterns are illustrated in table  <dig> with two clear major waves of diversification: one at the emergence of bilaterians and the other tied to the emergence of vertebrates . apart from these two waves, the toolkit was strongly conserved throughout vertebrates, although a few additional modifications were associated with teleosts ), tetrapods and mammals. gpcrs were perhaps most dynamic, particularly those involved in sensory information processing, which was likely a sign of environmental adaptation. for example, canis familiaris  was associated with  <dig> species-specific gpcr duplications .

gene families associated with the highest number of 2ros
gene families expanded during the course of 2r included predominantly tfs and signalling genes. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> expanded families. the highest number of 2r duplications was assigned to the t-box transcriptional factor family ; followed by integrin-α ; gpcrs of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone/vasopressin/oxytocin family ; and cdc <dig>  wnt ligand, annexin and pdz/lim domain family . the integrin-β repertoire  also underwent substantial expansion in the course of 2r .

afamilies which underwent expansion consist predominantly of genes encoding tfs and signalling proteins. 2r, two rounds; mmtv, mouse mammary tumor virus.

functional enrichment associated with 2ros
we searched for over- and underrepresented functional categories associated with 2ros. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> overrepresented gene ontology  biological process  terms. some terms were related, as the go classification used was a mixture of all hierarchy levels. no ontology should be seen in isolation; instead, specific functions should always be viewed in the context of higher-level functions. signal transduction  was the top overrepresented term, with  <dig> of the total pool of  <dig>  human-associated genes  being 2ros. the full list of overrepresented bp terms is given in additional file  <dig>  table s2_bp, while overrepresented molecular function  and cellular component  terms are given in additional file  <dig>  tables2_mf, and additional file  <dig>  tables2_cc, respectively.

asignal transduction is the top overrepresented term: almost three quarters of human genes associated with this term are marked as 2r-ohnologs . p values derive from the hypergeometric test with conditional correction taking into account the hierarchical structure of ontologies.

specific go terms revealed signalling pathways preferentially affected by 2r-wgd, that is, gpcrs, ras and its regulators, wnt pathway, and rtk-associated signalling . several terms also pointed to signalling associated with the cytoskeleton and cellular attachment . vertebrate evolutionary novelties could be associated with a high proportion of 2ros. for example, a number of overrepresented terms could be linked with the muscular upgrade: muscle contraction, skeletal muscle development and myoblast differentiation . higher-level terms indicated a general trend towards greater organismal complexity, as well as expanded locomotory and sensory abilities characteristic of vertebrates .

bp terms underrepresented among 2ros  were dominated by basic cellular functions strongly conserved throughout eukaryota, such as translation, dna repair, rna splicing, dna replication, protein folding, dna recombination, cellular respiration, mrna transport or ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process. underrepresented mf and cc terms are given in additional file  <dig>  tables3_mf, and additional file  <dig>  tables3_cc, respectively.

it was also intriguing to directly compare over- and underrepresented cc terms. the former  centered on the membrane and cellular skeleton, including plasma membrane, synapse, actin cytoskeleton, cell junction, postsynaptic membrane and contractile fiber. the latter , in contrast, centered on organelles, cytoplasm and the nucleus, including mitochondrion, spliceosome, ribosomal subunit, proteasome complex, nucleolus, chromosome and cytoplasm.

overall, these findings boldly underlined the conclusion that signal transduction genes were preferentially retained after 2r-wgd. in stark contrast, very different functional trends characterised duplications younger than 2r, corresponding to tandem or segmental duplications . overrepresented bp terms associated with these genes  were strongly biased towards immune functions and dna/nucleosome/chromatin packaging. crucially, terms associated with cell communication, development and cell cycle were strongly underrepresented .

pathways overrepresented among 2ros
investigation of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways overrepresented in gene duplications associated with 2r  revealed four classes of pathways:  canonical signalling pathways  signalling, wnt signalling, insulin signalling, erbb signalling, tgf-β signalling);  pathways associated with vertebrate novelties ;  pathways associated with the cellular cytoskeleton, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix  interactions ; and  disease-associated pathways .

protein domains overrepresented among 2ros
all pfam domains overrepresented among 2ros were related to signal transduction . the most obvious were typical signalling domains, such as the protein tyrosine kinase domain, the serine/threonine kinase domain , ras family signature, rhogef domain, rhogap domain, protein kinase c, protein-tyrosine phosphatase, neurotransmitter-gated ion channel domains and two types of 7tm domains . several further domains were associated with transcriptional factors integrated with signalling pathways, that is, homeobox domain, helix-loop-helix, or ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone receptor.

aall pfam domains overrepresented in gene duplications associated with 2ros at the p value cutoff of  <dig>  can be linked with signal transduction. p values derive from the hypergeometric test. egf, epidermal growth factor; ph domain, pleckstrin homology domain ; sh <dig>  src homology 3; sh <dig>  src homology 2; ig-like, plexins, transcription factors ; phosphotyrosine-binding domain/phosphotyrosine interaction domain .

the preferential expression of 2ros in neuronal tissues demonstrated in figure  <dig> is particularly exciting. additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  lists  <dig> 2ros preferentially expressed in brain . go terms  preferentially associated with these genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  table s7_bp; additional file  <dig>  table s7_cc; and additional file  <dig>  table s7_mf. the top three overrepresented terms in each category were as follows: synaptic transmission, neurological system process and cell communication ; synapse, cell junction and plasma membrane ; and calcium ion binding, transporter activity and calmodulin binding .

in the next step, we analysed expression divergence between paralogs and found that mrna expression similarity decays steadily over evolutionary time. this is proven by the falling average expression correlation between pairs of paralogs grouped by increasing age, detected using a variety of measures of expression distance  . no specific signature could be discerned for 2ros: the overall rate of expression divergence was similar between tandem and wgd duplicates, at least over large evolutionary time scales.

similar trends were inferred with relative protein concentration data derived from a large-scale antibody screen of human cell lines and tissues  <cit> . however, relative protein abundance between paralogs diverge with somewhat different temporal dynamics when tissue distribution , overall; tissue microarray focused , focused on positive regions) rather than cell line distribution  is considered . cma diverges gradually, reaching a plateau for duplications dated to mammals and older, similar to mrna divergence . in contrast, tma and tmaf divergence is low for human-specific duplications, but subsequent divergence is extremely rapid. one possible explanation is that tissue protein levels are stabilised posttranscriptionally by a mrna-level network of regulation, for example, through microrna , and this step is subtly influenced by the tissue microenvironment. the stabilising effect, however, decays rapidly over evolutionary time, as noncoding regions of paralogs, being under little selective constraint, rapidly diverge in sequence.

specific family examples
ras system was greatly affected by 2r
evolution of the ras family  was shaped predominantly by the 2r event. three vertebrate co-orthologs of ras, k-ras, n-ras and h-ras, originated from 2r. two further duplications in the ras family could be mapped to 2r:  ras-related protein ral-a  and ras-related protein ral-b  and  ras-related protein  and ras-related protein  <dig> .

rasgaps are gtpase-activating proteins. there are two subfamilies of rasgaps in treefam: tf <dig> and tf <dig>  in tf <dig>  ras protein activator-like  <dig> , ras protein activator-like  <dig> , disabled homolog 2-interacting protein , and syngap <dig>  are 2ros. dab2ip acts as a tumor suppressor gene and is inactivated by methylation or polycomb ezh <dig> complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer  <cit> . syngap is a synaptic-specific gtpase-activating protein  <cit> . there is only one rasgap of that subfamily in fly  and worm . in the second subfamily of rasgaps , two duplications can be mapped to 2r: ras gtpase-activating protein  <dig>  and rasgap-activating-like protein  <dig> , as well as ras gtpase-activating protein  <dig>  and ras gtpase-activating protein  <dig> .

cell cycle machinery expanded dramatically in the course of 2r
most cyclins, including key cell cycle-regulating groups a, b and d, underwent diversification at the base of vertebrates and are represented by two to four vertebrate-specific paralogs . analysis of the treefam database indicated that the following genes were also 2ros: cyclin-dependent kinases cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> , cdk <dig> and cdk <dig>  and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p <dig> and p <dig> , as well as p <dig> and p <dig>  and finally orthologs of the wee <dig>  inactivator of the cdk/cyclin complex, namely, wee <dig> and wee <dig> .

aall cyclin subfamilies are represented by two to four vertebrate-specific paralogs. cyclins a, b and d are key cell cycle regulators. cyclin d provides the link between the cell cycle and the signal transduction machinery.

neurotrophin family
neurotrophins are key growth factors influencing proliferation, differentiation, survival and death of neuronal cells. human neurotrophins  include ntf <dig> , brain-derived neurotrophic factor , ntf <dig>  and nerve growth factor . ntf <dig>  bdnf, ntf <dig> and ngf are evidently ohnologs deriving from the 2r-wgd . interestingly, worm and fly lack orthologs of neurotrophins  <cit> . the expanded neurotrophin family is most likely involved in the sculpturing of characteristically complex vertebrate nervous systems, with a large, centralized and multicompartmental brain.

histone deacetylases: cell-specific regulators of chromatin structure
the family of class ii histone deacetylases  includes four vertebrate genes, that is, hdac <dig> , hdac <dig> , hdac <dig>  and hdac <dig> . there is only one hdac in fly, worm and c. intestinalis . vertebrate hdacs have cell type-specific expression patterns and link through an n-terminal extension to tfs from a number of signalling pathways  <cit> . there are links with vertebrate novelties in the skeletal, circulatory and muscular systems. hdac <dig> is a corepressor controlling bone development  <cit> ; hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> have been shown to suppress cardiac stress signals and control cardiac development  <cit> ; and hdac <dig> also couples neuronal activity to muscle chromatin acetylation and gene expression  <cit> .

2r-wgd and the architecture of the human signalling network
first, we identified the total overlap between protein members of the  <dig> -node human cancer signalling map  of cui et al.  <cit>  and paralogous genes of different ages.  the overlap consisted of  <dig> nodes for duplications mapped to tetrapoda and younger,  <dig>  nodes for 2ros,  <dig> nodes for duplications linked with the emergence of chordates and  <dig> for those linked with the emergence of bilaterians . second, separate overlaps were identified for subnetworks consisting of positive, negative and scaffolding edges alone.

apalogs linked with different taxons are mapped to the human cancer signalling map . the entire network, as well as the subnetworks consisting of only positive, negative or scaffolding edges, are considered. the overlap between duplication sets of different ages and hcsm subnetworks is given in parentheses in the first column. in the remaining columns, following the value of the metric  calculated for the test subgraph, numbers in square brackets denote  the average value of the given metric calculated for  <dig>  random subgraphs and  the number of  <dig>  random subgraphs for which the given metric had lower value than for the test subgraph , and we cannot be certain whether the simple number of interacting partners  or the amount of information flowing through the given node  correspond more closely to the biological properties of the network which were selected for in evolution.

degree difference and edge conservation
we compared degree difference and edge conservation, following waves of duplications of different ages. degree difference, that is, the absolute value of degree subtraction between two nodes, is a metric of paralog connectivity divergence. the edge conservation concept is considered in the discussion section. table  <dig> shows that these two metrics were inversely correlated, that is, the lower the average degree difference, the higher the percentage of conserved edges. furthermore, edge conservation was higher and degree difference was lower between pairs of nodes linked with 2ros than those linked with gene duplications mapping to the base of chordates or bilaterians. the differences in conservation of edges were highly statistically significant. for example, when the entire signalling network was considered, ratios of conserved edges to the total number of edges, calculated for each paralogous pair separately and then averaged, were   <dig> ,   <dig>  and   <dig> , using wilcoxon rank-sum test p values for pairwise comparisons  <dig> versus  <dig> and  <dig> versus  <dig> were  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively. the differences were even more pronounced when distribution characteristics were considered: the percentages of paralogous pairs with more than one third of conserved edges were 39%, 9% and 17%, for ,  and , respectively. the percentages of paralogous pairs which had at least one conserved edge were 65%, 35% and 47%, respectively.

aparalogous gene pairs linked with different taxons are mapped to the human cancer signalling map . the entire network, as well as the subnetworks consisting of only positive, negative or scaffolding edges, is considered. the overlap between pair sets of different ages and hcsm subnetworks is given in parentheses in the first column. in the second column, the number of shared edges versus the total is given . in the third column, the average difference in degree between such node pairs is given.

it should be noted that the number of random node pairs with shared edges is much lower than the values observed among paralogs. by random sampling, we approximate that the expected fraction of shared ages under the null hypothesis is only  <dig> % , while only 4% of random node pairs have any shared edges . this strongly supports the conclusion that the presence of shared edges between duplicate nodes stems from their shared evolutionary ancestry.

interestingly, for all age groups, conservation of regulatory edges with negative impact was higher than those with positive impact. this effect was strongest for pairs of paralogous nodes linked with 2ros:  <dig>  of  <dig>  positive edges and  <dig>  of  <dig> negative edges were conserved. corresponding percentage figures for chordates and bilaterians were  <dig> % versus  <dig> % and  <dig> % versus  <dig> %, respectively .

we further subdivided 2ro-linked regulatory conserved edges into those originating from the shared interaction node and directed towards the paralogous pair  and those originating from the paralogous pair and directed towards the shared interaction node , with similar percentage frequencies .

finally, it should also be noted that the fraction of conserved edges for duplications mapping to tetrapoda and younger is not significantly different from that calculated for 2ros , suggesting that there is no dominant linear correlation between duplicate age and edge conservation and that greater edge conservation among 2ros than older single-gene duplications can be attributed in large measure to the inherent properties of genome duplication.

paralogous nodes linked by a bridging edge
a bridging edge is an edge directly linking the paralogous node pair. bridging interactions were preferentially of the scaffolding type. we identified  <dig> bridged 2ro pairs, with  <dig> scaffolding,  <dig> stimulatory and  <dig> inhibitory bridging edges . the apparent excess of activatory links was simply a reflection of the general bias in network composition. bridged pairs were also characterized by higher average number of edges,  <dig>  per pair versus  <dig> per pair in the total set , and had a similar fraction of conserved edges .

analysis of the inferred ap2r network and expression states
the fly ancestral ortholog set  is a set of unique drosophila melanogaster orthologs of human ohnolog pairs inferred from treefam with high confidence . to investigate associated topology features, the faos was linked to the fly ppi network described by giot et al.  <cit> . we found that faos nodes were characterised by increased degree . nodes linked with mammalian and chordate duplications exhibited even higher-degree biases:  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

we combined the faos with fly expression atlas   <cit>  to infer ap2r expression states, as well as patterns of expression sub- and neofunctionalisation. the following fea tissues were considered analogous to human tissues: brain, midgut, hindgut, heart, ovary, testis and fat. however, we found good correlation between the fea and the gea only for brain and not for the other six tissues . on top of that, in the past we have found that brain had the highest number of uniquely expressed genes and was robust in comparative expression tests  <cit> . therefore, we concentrated on brain expression.

to investigate the evolution of ap2r expression states, we identified gene triads consisting of a unique fly ortholog  and a pair of human paralogs, where the three genes could be linked to expression data in the fea or the gea. we then established whether these genes were preferentially expressed in brain. preferential brain expression  was defined as brain signal higher than the average signal for all tissues. "b" denotes the pbe, while "nb" denotes the lack thereof. triads in each of six possible configurations were then quantified and interpreted . for example, "b: b & b" and "nb: nb & nb" correspond to straightforward conservation of brain expression status. more interestingly, "b: b & nb" signifies subfunctionalisation through loss of the pbe in one of the paralogs, while "nb: nb & b" is interpreted as neofunctionalisation through gain of the pbe.

awe quantified triads depending on brain expression status of a pair of human duplicated genes mapped to unique fly ortholog, depending on timing of duplication . pbe, preferential brain expression.

the first interesting observation was that subfunctionalisation was two to three times more common relative to neofunctionalisation among 2ros than among other duplicates . clearly, subfunctionalisation, as a faster process, was well suited for network remodeling following 2r-wgd. the second important observation was that expression neofunctionalisation into brain was very rare among duplicates dating to tetrapoda and younger, supporting the interpretation of 2r as the formative event for vertebrate brains.

discussion
2r-wgd occurred more than  <dig> million years ago, and most resulting gene duplicates were lost, leading to rediploidisation. here we set out to functionally characterize retained 2ros. first, we found that signal transduction was the most enriched go term . in total, 74% of human signalling genes were descendants of 2ros. foreshadowing later findings, several go terms were associated with the nervous system: neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, axon guidance, nervous system development and neuron differentiation . next, we searched for protein domains enriched among 2ros and found many classic signalling domains, as well as well-known protein interaction  domains, such as src homology  <dig> , src homology  <dig> , phosphotyrosine-binding domain  and pdz . the pi domains aid signalling by enabling dynamic formation of signalling protein complexes. for example, sh <dig> and ptb selectively recognise phosphorylated tyrosines, while sh <dig> binds proline-rich sequences with a characteristic motif pro-x-x-pro. sh <dig> proteins frequently form membrane-attached signal-processing complexes at autophosphorylated receptors and participate in positive and negative feedback loops of phosphorylation cascades. ptb-bearing proteins, in turn, are predominantly adaptors and docking stations, frequently anchored in the cell membrane , and promoting assembly of large signalling complexes at autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases. finally, pdz domains recognise internal valine or leucine residues and are abundant in synapses, serving as scaffolds for the assembly of large signalling complexes involved in neurotransmission.

to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of 2r-wgd, we investigated the relationship between relative timing of gene duplication and spatial expression domain of progeny genes. the heatmap in figure  <dig> revealed 2r's expression signature in the broader context of animal evolution. significantly, a trend could be observed for brain and nervous tissue expression  to map to the taxonomic cluster , bilateria, chordata and vertebrata, while being excluded from younger clusters  and . these expression patterns, taken together with the results of go analysis, suggested that the molecular machinery of the vertebrate neuron was defined in the 2r event and strongly conserved thereafter. a previous focused study of fly and mouse noted that vertebrate synapses were far more complex than those of invertebrates  <cit> , but the scale, the mechanism and the precise timing of this key evolutionary transition was hitherto unknown.

development of large multicompartmentalised vertebrate brains is shaped by three layers of control  <cit> :  establishment of patterning centres that secrete diffusible signalling ligands, such as wnts, bmps and soluble bone morphogenetic protein  antagonists;  brain-specific transcriptional regulatory networks involving tfs such as paired box proteins  and forkhead box protein ; and  extensive neuronal apoptosis shaping the fine detail of brain structures and compartments. for example, in a direct mechanistic demonstration, mice deficient in cysteine-aspartic acid protease  <dig>  exhibited decreased neuronal apoptosis and hyperplasia, resulting in gross brain abnormalities  <cit> . how important was 2r-wgd for the definition of this developmental toolkit? we found that multiple wnt ligands , pax2/5/ <dig> and pax1/ <dig> , foxp1/2/3/ <dig>  and casp3/ <dig>  were 2ros. previously, we showed that the evolution of the bmp/tgf-β pathway was guided almost entirely by 2r-wgd  <cit> . in conclusion, we identified most of the vertebrate brain developmental toolkit as 2ros.

the exclusion of nervous tissue from the expression domain of newly formed mammalian and primate genes contradicts intuition. however, anatomical differences between vertebrate nervous systems can be sufficiently explained by changes in developmental expression patterns of existing regulatory and structural genes of the neuron. higher complexity of mental functions in certain vertebrate lineages  is likely to stem from these anatomical differences, as well as more complex ways in which neurons are connected, as demonstrated by the rising area of connectomics.

uniquely in animal evolution, and in stark contrast to other basic cellular functions, 2r-wgd expanded the cell cycle machinery, in particular cyclins a and b, and the interface with signalling made up by cyclins d1-d <dig>  cdk4/ <dig>  p21/p <dig> and p18/p <dig>  cyclin d levels  do not correlate with cell-cycle phases but with extracellular mitogens, cytokines, hormones and juxtacrine ligands. signalling pathways induce expression of cyclin d, which pairs with cyclin-dependent kinases  of types  <dig> and  <dig>  stimulating the cell to enter the cycle from g <dig>   we identify all four sets of genes involved  as 2ros.

arguably, the cyclin/cdk engine might be a relatively late evolutionary invention, taking over from ancient kinases  <cit> , and with the inherent tendency for redundancy characteristic of an integrating system  <cit> . however, cyclin/cdk signalling is very well documented in yeast. regardless of the controversy regarding the nature of primordial cell-cycle regulators, the results presented here suggest that control over cell cycles became more important in large and long-lived animals and that expansion of the cyclin/cdk network, which occurred through genome duplication, facilitated fine-tuning of that control. no such regulatory upgrade was required for other basic cellular functions . we hope to open a new area of investigation into the differences of cell-cycle control between vertebrates and model species such as fly, worm and yeast, with important consequences for both basic and applied science. as cyclin d1-d3/cdk4/ <dig> complexes have at least partially overlapping phosphorylation targets, the apparent functional redundancy serves to integrate multiple upstream signals. in other words, 2r-wgd most likely resulted in retention of duplicates with different signalling inputs but similar outputs. kinetic modeling, protein interaction and target screens focused on differences between invertebrate and vertebrate cyclin/cdk networks should yield the first clues.

the next question we decided to ask was whether signalling network nodes linked with 2ros exhibited some characteristic features, such as the degree  or betweenness centrality . the degree of human 2ro nodes was significantly increased, with the strongest effect on outdegree of negative regulation . this suggested that highly connected nodes, that is, network hubs, in particular those involving negative regulators, were preferentially retained. enrichment of 2ros in pi domains, as shown by pfam analysis, also suggested higher interconnectedness of the post-2r network. the likely biological result of this trend towards greater network complexity was increased signalling robustness and cross-talk. negative feedback loops, on the other hand, were likely to mediate inducible and temporary biological responses invoked by external stimuli or network oscillations facilitating spatiotemporal patterning during vertebrate development.

however, was high connectedness driving preferential retention, or was it merely a consequence of rediploidisation? if only we could sequence the genome of the ap2r animal! this is, of course, impossible, but some features can be inferred from extant species. to this end, we compared fly and human and found that hubs were already enriched in genes ancestral to 2ros. high connectedness was therefore a factor contributing towards preferential retention. interestingly, ancestral nodes associated with mammalian and chordate duplications exhibited even higher connectivity biases, but the progeny of these genes were not associated with human hubs. this could be explained by the evolutionary model in which all duplications preferentially target highly connected nodes but wgds preserve their status as hubs, while tandem and segmental duplications remodel them towards reduced connectivity.

do gene duplications conserve interactions or rewire duplicates with novel interaction partners? we must first define a few concepts which will help us approach network topology from the evolutionary perspective, with a focus on gene duplication. let us define shared edges as a pair of edges extending between two nodes and an identical third node. a conserved edge, on the other hand, corresponds to an ancestral interaction in the ancestral network, which is still present in the extant network. we can see that shared edges between a pair of 2ros are parsimoniously explained as conserved edges , as the probability of gaining shared edges through convergent evolution is extremely low. finally, a bridging edge is an edge directly linking the paralogous node pair, suggesting sophisticated forms of regulatory feedback and information processing between duplicates  <cit> . the bridging edge is an evolutionary novelty created as a consequence of duplication, possibly but not necessarily associated with ancestral proteins prone to homodimerisation.

when the concepts of shared, conserved and bridging edges are applied to hcsm , a number of observations emerge:  the fraction of conserved edges is higher for 2ros than for paralogs mapping to chordates or bilaterians,  the fraction of conserved regulatory edges with negative impact is higher than those with positive impact, and  complex novel network motifs are formed by bridged hubs . figure  <dig> shows a graph representation of a hcsm subnetwork focusing on the apoptosis pathway featuring three bridged 2ro pairs. overall, bridged pairs are extremely rich in signalling hubs, with twice the average number of interacting partners. in terms of the broader evolutionary impact, we propose that  <dig> million years ago, at the time of 2r, instantaneous doubling of the signalling network through wgd not only immediately expanded the available space of network states but also kick-started rapid coevolution of nodes into novel topologies. the cumulative effect was that of greatly increased phenotype space, enabling adaptation to an expanded range of physiological parameters, such as temperature, osmotic pressure, availability of nutrients and growth factors. greater organismal adaptability facilitated, in turn, colonisation of novel environments or ecological niches. 2r-wgd was most likely an instantaneous speciation, in itself an extraordinary evolutionary event, somewhat contrary to the classic darwinian view of gradual evolution. it probably took place under stress conditions on the fringes of the normal ecological range of the parental species. few "hopeful monsters", with duplicated genomes, must have had an instant adaptability advantage to compete with ap2r parental populations, despite the increased costs of dna replication, chromatin remodeling and chromosome segregation associated with polyploidy. for example, conant and wolfe  <cit>  proposed that yeast wgd conferred an immediate selective advantage for growth in high-glucose environments through the increase of dosage of genes in the glycolytic pathway. in the longer term, as proven by our go analysis, 2r-wgd likely also provided a drive for increased morphological complexity  <cit>  and conferred greater evolvability, facilitating the emergence of vertebrate novelties.

CONCLUSIONS
herein we present the first global analysis of functional trends among 2r-wgd-retained genes using state-of-the-art methodology and a high-quality data set verified through manual curation. in a methodological advance, 2r ohnologs were identified using detailed phylogenetic trees on the basis of a tree-merging algorithm implemented in the treefam database. we found that 2r-wgd was the paramount source of novelty in vertebrate evolution, affecting an overwhelming majority  of signalling genes, in particular developmental pathways involving receptor tyrosine kinases, wnt and tgf-β ligands, gpcrs and apoptosis pathway. moreover, 2r-wgd redefined vertebrate synapses and facilitated the formation of centralised brains. we show that 2r-wgd preferentially retained genes associated with higher organismal complexity , while genes associated with basic cellular functions  tended to be excluded. in conclusion, 2r-wgd left an indelible imprint on the vertebrate signalling network  and set the stage for the emergence of key vertebrate functional novelties, facilitating the evolutionary success of this taxonomic group. finally, we link observed functional trends to signalling network and expression evolution, investigating the human signalling network and the inferred ap2r network, a comparison that has never previously been performed.
