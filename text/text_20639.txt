BACKGROUND
nucleases are defined as a group of enzymes which are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphodiester linkages of nucleic acids. according to the substrates they hydrolyze, nucleases are divided into two groups: sugar specific nucleases  and sugar non-specific nucleases  <cit> . sugar non-specific nucleases, characterized by their ability to hydrolyze both dna and rna without exhibiting pronounced base preferences, have been detected from a wide variety of sources, such as virus, bacteria, fungi and animals  <cit> . many of them are extracellular, but some have been found in nuclei, vacuoles, mycelia, mitochondria, conidia, microplasmodia and periplasm  <cit> . sugar non-specific nucleases play very important roles in different aspects of basic genetic mechanisms, including their participation in mutation avoidance, dna repair, dna replication and recombination, scavenging of nucleotides and phosphates for the growth and metabolism, host defense against foreign nucleic acid molecules, programmed cell death and establishment of an infection. due to their important roles in nucleic acid metabolisms, the sugar non-specific nucleases have been extensively used in molecular biology researches, for example the determination of nucleic acid structure, the rapid sequencing of rna, the removal of nucleic acids during protein purification and the use as antiviral agents  <cit> .

up to date, more than  <dig> nucleases have been obtained from microorganisms, such as staphylococcal nuclease from staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens nuclease from serratia marcescens, s <dig> nuclease from aspergillus oryzae, p <dig> nuclease from penicillium citrinum, bal <dig> nuclease from alteromonas espejiana and nuca from anabaena  <cit> . with regard to virus, only the pc <dig> protein from fowlpox virus and rwssv-nsn from shrimp white spot syndrome virus are identified as non-specific nucleases  <cit> . however, all the non-specific nucleases are obtained from mesophiles or mesophilic viruses. no study has reported on nucleases from thermophilic viruses. compared with mesophilic enzymes, thermostable nucleases may possess novel properties in structures and biological functions.

in the present study, a non-specific nuclease gene  was cloned from a thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv <dig> for the first time. the sequence homology analysis revealed that it was a novel nuclease. the recombinant gbsv1-nsn nuclease was further characterized. it was shown that the gbsv1-nsn enzyme was thermostable.

RESULTS
recombinant expression and determination of a novel non-specific nuclease gbsv1-nsn
based on genome sequence analysis of thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv <dig>  an open reading frame   of gbsv <dig> shared homologies with phage replication proteins , which contained a dnad-like domain, suggesting that the protein encoded by this orf had the dna binding capacity. in order to identify its biological function, the orf  was expressed as gst fusion protein in e.coli. after induction with iptg at 37°c, the induced and non-induced recombinant bacterium  and control bacterium  were analyzed by sds-page. a band  corresponding to the gst-gbsv1-nsn fusion protein was observed in the induced recombinant bacterium containing gbsv1-nsn gene , while no protein was found in the same positions in the induced and non-induced controls , showing that the gbsv1-nsn gene was expressed. after purification by affinity chromatography, a gst-gbsv1-nsn fusion protein was obtained . the fusion protein gst-gbsv1-nsn was efficiently cleaved by thrombin, yielding the purified gbsv1-nsn with a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda .

in an attempt to determine the dna binding capacity of the recombinant gbsv1-nsn, the purified gbsv1-nsn protein was incubated with the genomic dna of bacteriophage gbsv <dig>  surprisingly, the dna was degraded by the gbsv1-nsn protein, suggesting it might be a nuclease. to evaluate its substrate specificity, the purified gbsv1-nsn protein was incubated with various nucleic acids including the circular pgex-4t- <dig> plasmid dsdna, the linear pgex-4t- <dig> plasmid dsdna, the phix <dig> virion ssdna and the baker's yeast rna. the results showed that all the nucleic acids could be degraded by the gbsv1-nsn protein , indicating that it was a non-specific nuclease.

homology analysis revealed that the gbsv1-nsn protein shared low identities with known nucleases. it had  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities with those of staphylococcus aureus thermonuclease , serratia marcescens nuclease , anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> nuclease , homo sapiens endog  and wssv-nsn nuclease , respectively. these data suggested that the gbsv1-nsn was a novel non-specific nuclease.

the effects of temperature and ph on gbsv1-nsn enzymatic activity
the nuclease activity estimated at different temperatures indicated that the optimum temperature for the recombinant gbsv1-nsn was 60°c . the gbsv1-nsn nuclease activity was decreased with higher temperatures above the optimum. thermostability assays showed that the gbsv1-nsn nuclease was most stable at 60°c , retaining more than 80% of its enzymatic activity for at least  <dig> hours .

based on the effects of ph on enzymatic activity, the gbsv1-nsn nuclease exhibited optimal activity at ph  <dig>  . the recombinant nuclease was stable in the neutral ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . it presented higher stability after incubation at 60°c for  <dig> hours, showing  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> % residual activity at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

responses of the gbsv1-nsn nuclease to metal ions, enzyme inhibitors and detergents
the effects of different metal ions on the gbsv1-nsn nuclease activity were evaluated as shown in table  <dig>  in the absence of metal ion, the gbsv1-nsn nuclease was active. the enzymatic activity was obviously stimulated in the presence of mn2+ and zn2+ at  <dig> mm concentration each. metal ions li+, na+, k+, cs+, ca2+, mg2+, ni2+, sr2+ and ba2+ at different concentrations showed very slight inhibition of the gbsv1-nsn activity, retaining more than 80% of its initial activity. however, its activity was strongly inhibited by cu2+ and fe3+. with the increasing in cu2+ or fe3+ concentration, the nuclease activity decreased sharply.

the results indicated that the recombinant nuclease was active when some metal chelators, thiol reagents and detergents were used . however, the enzymatic activity was reduced by some enzyme inhibitors or detergents, such as ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid , citrate, dithiothreitol , β-mecaptoethanol , guanidine hydrochloride, urea and sds. among them,  <dig> mm of dtt and  <dig>  m of guanidine hydrochloride led to a significant reduction of enzyme activity by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. in contrast, the nuclease activity was enhanced by tritonx- <dig>  tween- <dig> or chaps to approximately  <dig>  –  <dig> %.

kinetic parameters of the gbsv1-nsn nuclease
the kinetic parameters of the nuclease were obtained from lineweaver-burke plot of specific activities at 60°c with different substrates including the double-stranded dna , single-stranded dna  and rna. the results revealed that its km value was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> μg/ml and vmax value was  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> kunitz units·mg- <dig> for the dsdna, ssdna and rna, respectively . after calculations, the kcat of gbsv1-nsn nuclease was estimated to be  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> s- <dig> for the dsdna, ssdna and rna substrates, respectively .

discussion
driven by increasing industrial demands for thermostable biocatalysts, thermophiles have attracted more and more attention as a valuable source of novel enzymes  <cit> . most thermophilic enzymes were extensively studied from thermophilic archaea and bacteria. however only a few enzymes from thermophilic bacteriophages have been characterized, for example thermostable rna ligase  <cit> , polynucleotide kinase  <cit>  and lytic enzyme  <cit> . therefore, thermophilic bacteriophages are a considerable resource of thermophilic enzymes. in this investigation, the recombinant gbsv1-nsn protein from the thermophilic bacteriophage gbsv <dig> exhibited non-specific nuclease activity.

the results showed that the gbsv1-nsn nuclease was active at temperatures ranging from 20°c to 80°c with an optimal temperature of 60°c, which was higher than those of most of the reported non-specific nucleases. in the respect of effects of metal ions on the enzymatic activity, the gbsv1-nsn was similar to the nuclease α from u. maydis and wheat chloroplast nuclease that did not show an obligate requirement of metal ions for their activities  <cit> . it was found that mn2+ or zn2+ could stimulate the gbsv1-nsn activity. this stimulation was also observed in the cole <dig> nuclease which bound a transition metal ion mn2+ or zn2+ in its h-n-h motif  <cit> . however edta had a mild effect in reducing the activity of the gbsv1-nsn enzyme. the data suggested that metal ions had a stimulatory effect but were not obligatory for nuclease activity and that they might play roles in stabilizing the enzymatic structure. it could not be ruled out whether the gbsv1-nsn enzyme was copurified with some tightly bound metal ions, as was the case of some other nucleases. this point remained to be further addressed. the amino acid sequence analysis of the gbsv1-nsn revealed the existence of two cys residues, indicating that the nuclease might contain a disulfide bridge. it was found that the gbsv1-nsn nuclease activity was inhibited by thiol reagents dtt or β-me, suggesting that its disulfide bridge could play an important role in determining the activity of this nuclease. however the enzyme was stimulated by tritonx- <dig>  tween- <dig> and chaps. comparisons of the catalytic properties of the gbsv1-nsn with the known nucleases suggested that it had a similar efficiency in dsdna hydrolysis as the serratia nuclease   <cit>  and f. succinogenes dnase a  <cit> . however, it had lower catalytic efficiency than that of anabaena nuca in cleavage of various nucleic acids and than that of staphylococcus nuclease  in cleavage of ssdna .

although the gbsv1-nsn protein displayed non-specific nuclease activity, it shared no homology to any known nucleases in the primary amino acid sequences. our data indicated that the gbsv1-nsn was a novel member of non-specific nuclease family, which was thermostable and disulfide bridge-dependent.

based on sequence analysis, the gbsv1-nsn protein was highly homologous with the phage replication protein and contained a dnad-like domain, suggesting that it might play important roles in bacteriophagic dna replication. as well known, dna replication is divided into three main stages, that is initiation, elongation and termination. in some gram-positive bacteria with low g+c content, the dna replication initiation involves remodeling of a replication origin through the action of the main initiator protein dnaa and primosomal multiprotein cascades including dnad. these initiator proteins interact with helicases to recruit the dna primases. dnad is believed to be involved in the cascade for helicase recruitment  <cit> . considering that the gbsv1-nsn nuclease contained dnad domain, this protein might possess multiple biochemical activities, including the nuclease activity and involvements in the dna replication initiation, as well as in mismatch bacteriophagic dna repair.

up to date, the non-specific nucleases already available are obtained from mesophiles. the discovery of thermostable gbsv1-nsn nuclease in this study would facilitate the applications of nucleases in molecular biology researches and in industry at high temperatures, such as the determination of nucleic acid structure, the removal of nucleic acids during protein purification and the use as antiviral agents. those are merited to be further studied.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have determined a novel thermostable non-specific nuclease from thermophilic bacteriophage for the first time, which shared no homology with any known nucleases. the characterizations of the recombinant gbsv1-nsn showed that it was a thermostable nuclease. in this investigation, the recombinant gbsv1-nsn could be obtained in large quantity by expression in e. coli. this would facilitate its biotechnological applications.
