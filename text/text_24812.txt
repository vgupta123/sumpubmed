BACKGROUND
species richness and genetic diversity within species are proposed to co-vary and understanding the details of this relationship is critical to unifying biodiversity theory  <cit> . though the forests of the upper amazon basin are a renowned hotspot for amphibian species richness  <cit> , thus far there have been few explorations of the phylogeographic and population-level patterns in the region's amphibian taxa  <cit> . consequently, we have only a preliminary knowledge of the distribution of genetic diversity from merely a handful of amphibian species in the megadiverse upper amazon. with the aim of augmenting our understanding of spatial patterns of genetic diversity and details of evolutionary history in this famously species-rich area, we assessed the diversity in a widespread upper amazonian frog species across the upper amazon of ecuador.

historical and environmental characteristics of a region influence multiple levels of diversity, both in its origin and maintenance  <cit> . numerous regional historical, topographical, and ecological factors of the andes and amazon have been suggested as influential in the diversification of species, for example: riverine barriers  <cit> ; large uninterrupted area  <cit> ; an andean "species pump" promoted by complex, isolating montane topography and vegetation  <cit> ; pleistocene forest refuges  <cit> ; complex biotic interactions  <cit> ; ancient ridges and other palaeogeographic features  <cit> ; ancientness  <cit> ; and relative youth of the andes  <cit> . for amphibians, complex topography may restrict vagility and produce marked population subdivision, and ultimately patterns of adaptive radiation or isolation patterns that are potentially implicated in high local rates of speciation  <cit> . there are many confounds in the upper amazon that make exclusive testing of any one of these factors challenging because multiple causes at various historical timescales are surely involved in the origination of diversity  <cit> . nonetheless, contributing temporal and geographical patterns of diversity in phylogeographic studies allows us to discern among some of the diversification hypotheses . assessing these patterns is critical to disentangling the causes of within and among species diversification and the genesis of anuran biodiversity, especially as this region increasingly suffers deforestation.

here we use mitochondrial and nuclear dna to quantify the phylogeography and population structure of a terrestrial upper amazonian leaflitter frog, eleutherodactylus ockendeni . we sampled from  <dig> localities across the species range in megadiverse eastern ecuador to develop a thorough regional phylogeographic survey. further, we used phylogenetic and multiple coalescent methods to estimate the depth of divergence among clades and suggest temporal context for the divergence revealed by our analyses.

RESULTS
dna sequences
we sequenced  <dig> individuals for cytochrome b  and  <dig> individuals for 16s, plus two outgroup taxa . ingroup base frequencies are similar to those found in other frogs  <cit> : cyt b: a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig> ; 16s: a =  <dig> , c =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , t =  <dig> . ingroup cyt b sequences collapsed into  <dig> unique haplotypes and 16s into  <dig> unique haplotypes. for the 16s-cytb data combined ,  <dig> included characters were parsimony informative.

phylogenetic analyses
we found no conflicting phylogenetic signal between the cyt b and 16s data , justifying the use of the combined data partition in maximum parsimony  analyses. both mp and bayesian analyses of the 16s-cytb data produced well-supported trees identical in all major topological details and with three major clades: an upland clade , a lowland clade ; and a southeastern clade  . the topology of the 16s-cytb trees is congruent with trees resulting from separate analyses of the full 16s and cyt b data .

population genetics
corrected p-distances between e. ockendeni cyt b haplotypes were high, ranging up to 20% between some haplotypes . mean net divergence ± standard error  <cit>  between the southeastern clade and the upland clade was  <dig> % ±  <dig> , between the southeastern clade and the lowland clade was  <dig> % ±  <dig> , and between upland and lowland clades was  <dig> % ±  <dig> . average sequence divergence was low within the upland and lowland clades, at  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively, while the southeastern clade, which has fewer haplotypes and more geographically distant sampling, showed more intraclade diversity at  <dig> %.

for the cyt b data, the identity of haplotypes varied among localities but seven of the  <dig> sites had only a single haplotype . nucleotide diversities within localities range from  <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig> . however, high nucleotide diversity within localities ebjs  and auca  <dig>  is an artefact of finding sympatric but genetically distinct clades at those localities. when calculations of locality nucleotide diversity are separated by clade, the values range from  <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . hky+g was the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution for cyt b as chosen by hlrt.

cyt b population diversity values: locality , number of individuals sequenced , number of haplotypes , haplotype diversity , nucleotide diversity , polymorphic sites , cyt b haplotype sharing, and clade . where more than one clade is found at a particular locality, analyses are shown combined and separated by clade.

the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations between all pairs of clades as calculated with a mcdonald-kreitman test does not suggest that selection is responsible for the cyt b divergence among lineages . overall non-significant value of tajima's d  and within clades  also implies neutrality .

mismatch analysis parameters by clade: mean number of observed differences; expansion parameter τ ; θ is the substitution rate before  and after  the expansion; ssd tests the validity of a stepwise expansion model based on the sum of squares deviations between the observed and expected mismatch, with probability values . non-significant mismatch values suggest population expansion. raggedness index is calculated similarly, and with probability values . non-significant raggedness values suggest population expansion. time since lineage expansion  is calculated from τ = 2μt, where μ =  <dig> %/myr for  <dig> bp. under a model of sudden population expansion, fu's f and tajima's d are expected to be significantly negative. some parameters are not estimated for the southeastern clade because of small sample sizes.

a survey of five tetranucleotide microsatellite loci across individuals of the upland and lowland clades in the napo river area , including a locale where both mitochondrial clades are present, shows that microsatellite genotypes at all loci are very different between upland and lowland clades. this implies complete reproductive isolation. the microsatellite library was developed based on lowland clade frogs. consequently, in individuals from the upland clade the microsatellite loci are either non-functional  or allele sizes are non-overlapping or have very different range of sizes, with the upland clade always having the larger mean allele size . sequences of large alleles from a subset of samples from three of the five loci  demonstrate that very large allele sizes in upland clade individuals are due to an increase in the number of microsatellite repeats .

microsatellite profiles  by locus examined in e. ockendeni from the napo river area . microsatellite allele sizes  were larger in the upland than lowland clade. using e. ockendeni primers  <cit> , one locus exclusively amplified in the lowland clade, suggesting it is non-functional in the upland clade.

estimating divergence and expansion
we used three different methods to estimate divergence: the net divergence method to estimate species divergence time; a bayesian mcmc method to estimate lineage divergence ; and, a coalescent mcmc approach to estimate migration and tmrca. of these, the net divergence method and the bayesian mcmc method  gave similar temporal results. divergence estimates from coalescent analyses  were typically less than half the age of the other two estimates.

by the net divergence method, time of divergence between the upland and lowland lineages using our slowest estimated rate of evolution  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya  while the faster rate  estimates the same split at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya  . southeastern clade split from upland and lowland clades approximately  <dig> ±  <dig> mya  at the slower substitution rate and  <dig> ±  <dig> mya  by the faster rate.

time of divergence estimates among monophyletic clades in millions of years  calculated from net divergence among clades  assuming  <dig> % and  <dig> %/myr substitution rates.

from beast, assuming a constant molecular clock and rates of  <dig>  and  <dig> % substitutions per million years, we estimated the tmrca of the entire ingroup to be  <dig>  mya  and  <dig>  mya , respectively. for the tmrca of the upland and lowland clades, the constant clock tmrca estimates  <dig>  mya  or  <dig>  mya , respectively. the uncorrelated, relaxed clock estimates were not substantially different: assuming mean substitution rates of  <dig>  and  <dig> %, the tmrca estimates for the entire ingroup were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya, respectively, while those for the lowland/upland clade were  <dig>  and  <dig>  mya, respectively .

time of divergence estimates among monophyletic clades in millions of years  at  <dig> % and  <dig> %/myr substitution rates calculated from bayesian coalescent phylogenetic estimation of time to most recent common ancestor , modelled assuming a relaxed or constant molecular clock .

coalescent calculations  of the upland and lowland clade divergence resulted in an average θ of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and an average t of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . estimates of tmrca are  <dig>  mya assuming a substitution rate of  <dig> %/myr and  <dig>  mya assuming the faster substitution rate of  <dig> %/myr. in models of southeastern clade versus upland clade divergence, θ averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and t  <dig>  ±  <dig> , suggesting a tmrca of  <dig>  mya under the slower substitution rate and  <dig>  mya, with the faster rate. models of southeastern versus lowland clades identified an average θ of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and an average t of  <dig>  ±  <dig> , or  <dig>  mya or  <dig>  mya tmrca, depending on substitution rate. for all clade comparisons m modelled best as  <dig> suggesting there is no gene flow among clades. the estimated time since population divergence among all clades is less than the tmrca. mdiv estimates of tmrca and species divergence are non-overlapping with beast and the net divergence method.

time estimates are based on substitution rates of  <dig> %/myr and  <dig> %/myr.

estimating population expansion
we used four different methods to try and identify and estimate the timing of population expansion. based on mismatch analyses, the sudden expansion model of population growth cannot be rejected for the upland or the lowland clades, although the ssd probability was marginal for the lowland clade  . using a mutation rate of  <dig> %/myr and the peak of the mismatch distribution, τ, to estimate the time of population expansion suggests an upland clade expansion began in the latter half of the pleistocene , a lowland clade expansion  somewhat later . the model of sudden population expansion is rejected for the southeastern clade. raggedness indices suggest population expansion  in all three clades. fu's f and tajima's d are not different than would be found under a stable population size. therefore, we have conflicting evidence from different methods but some suggestion of population expansion particularly in the upland clade.

discussion
phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships
divergence among the three strongly supported clades in ecuadorean e. ockendeni is deep and well supported . in contrast, there is relatively low divergence within the three clades. the southeastern clade is basal relative to the upland and lowland clades. the timing of the divergences for all three lineages suggests causal events that vastly predate the pleistocene and the latter phases of orogenesis in the northern andes. we discuss these below.

five independent nuclear markers corroborate that the upland and lowland clades are evolutionarily distinct. the microsatellite loci were either non-amplifying or composed of twice as many repeats in the upland as lowland clade, even in frogs from the same geographic locality . such differentiation at microsatellite loci between clades even when they are sympatric and the potential for interbreeding exists provides strong indirect support that these are reproductively isolated. unfortunately, we still know little of the mate recognition system for this complex of species.

the major e. ockendeni clades are geographically restricted and found in the east andean uplands , the central and northern lowlands , and the central and southern lowlands . our sampling is limited to ecuador and therefore we cannot infer whether the clades are more broadly distributed. the headwaters of the napo river appears to be part of a lineage contact zone: at ebjs  both the upland and lowland clade can be found; slightly upriver at serena  and cando , the lowland clade is found on the south side of the napo river while the upland clade is found immediately on the opposite side of the river. further east at auca  <dig> road , again two lineages can be found sympatrically . at all other geographic localities sampled we found only one of the three clades. physalaemus petersi was also found to have an upper napo and lower napo genetic division and a basal southeastern lineage  <cit> . further, an upper and lower napo basin phylogeographic break has been suggested in bolitoglossa salamanders  <cit> . therefore, evidence from other amphibians may indicate this to be a cryptic geographic break, as has been found in other upper amazon localities  <cit> .

in e. ockendeni, the lack of haplotypic diversity at many localities and general lack of haplotype sharing among localities suggests fine-scale restricted gene flow , as might be expected from a small terrestrial amphibian  <cit> . population structure at finer geographic scales in the upper amazon has also suggested restricted gene flow in this species  <cit> .

we have included e. ockendeni from cuyabeno  in northeastern ecuador in the lowland clade; however, they do display a notable genetic divergence from the rest of the lowland clade  in a group that is otherwise characterized by low within-clade diversity. further sampling from the surrounding geographic area  and more molecular markers will either strengthen our inclusion of cuyabeno e. ockendeni in the lowland clade or differentiate it as a separate clade.

time of divergence
our divergence estimates suggest that diversification among the "species" e. ockendeni is ancient and predates the andes at their current height in ecuador. divergence between the southeastern and upland/lowland lineages occurred in the late oligocene or early miocene and between the upland and lowland clade in the early, mid-, or late miocene, depending on substitution rate.

of the three estimates, we consider the bayesian phylogenetic-coalescent method  to be the most accurate because that method accommodates the greatest number of parameters, incorporates molecular evolutionary complexities such as rate heterogeneity, allows for differences in rates among lineages, and allows for tests of the molecular clock  <cit> . interestingly, and in support of a long-standing method, the much less complicated net divergence method  has yielded very similar species divergence time estimates to the bayesian method tmrca. we suggest that the mdiv coalescent method  is underestimating time of divergence in this case, perhaps because there is not enough historical information to suit a population coalescent method when species are reciprocally monophyletic and deeply diverged, or because mdiv does not accommodate rate variation among sites.

some studies have found the rate of molecular evolution in the tropics to be equivalent to temperate areas  <cit>  while others have suggested a faster rate of molecular evolution in the tropics  <cit> . obviously, the timing of the divergence among e. ockendeni clades will become younger given the same genetic distance if true substitution rate is faster than we have estimated.

historical population change
across three different tests, there is weak and somewhat conflicting suggestion of recent population expansion under models of neutral evolution . for the upland clade, we cannot reject sudden expansion from mismatch distributions or raggedness though fu's f and tajima's d do not suggest population expansion. for the lowland clade, we can probably reject population expansion since mismatch and raggedness significance values are only barely non-significant  and f and d do not suggest expansion. in the southeastern clade, sample sizes are very small , but mismatch and f do not suggest population expansion while raggedness index does fit the expectation of expansion.

our results give some support for an upland clade expansion in e. ockendeni approximately  <dig>  <dig> years ago. it is difficult to determine historical population expansion; inconclusive findings from multiple methods are not unexpected because rate heterogeneity, the scale of historical population expansion if there were any, sample size, and number of polymorphic sites are all influential factors  <cit> . if there has been expansion in the lowland clade, this may have occurred  <dig>  <dig> years ago. in upper amazonian clades of the terrestrial frog p. petersi, inconclusive results about a population expansion have also been found and, like our results here, some support for an upper napo clade expansion  <cit> .

geological history and its influence on phylogeographic patterns
the upper amazon of ecuador has a history of variations in climate and dramatic geology. the northern andes are the youngest in the andean chain: orogenesis occurred in the neogene   <cit> , with the principle period of upheaval only in the past five million years  <cit> .

throughout the miocene there was a radical reorganization of drainage patterns in northern south america. in the early miocene the fluvial system drained to the northwest but by the late miocene the effects of the rising eastern cordillera shifted drainage eastwards, ultimately allowing the amazon river to reach the atlantic  <cit> . episodic marine incursions as a result of eustatic sea level changes occurred throughout the miocene  <cit> . in the pliocene, pleistocene, and holocene, fluvial deposits of many sorts and very large alluvial fans  were laid throughout the upper amazon in the wake of andean tectonism, volcanism, and later glaciation . these overlays and heterogeneity often leave conflicting evidence and cause geological events east of the andes to be poorly dated  <cit> .

climate also has varied over time, with great fluctuations throughout the tertiary and quaternary  <cit> . alternating wet and dry cycles in the pleistocene and holocene may have caused forest contractions and expansions in some areas, though there is disagreement on the extent of this effect in the upper amazon  <cit> . these forest contracts are the source of the refuge hypothesis of amazonian diversification  <cit> .

clearly there are multiple possible ancient historical geological and climatic influences causing isolation and subsequent expansion in e. ockendeni, ultimately resulting in the speciation we see here. we can infer that diversification between clades of e. ockendeni predates the altitude and shape of the andes as we know them. instead, diversification is much older, perhaps precipitated by dramatic changes in the miocene. for example, mountain-building caused numerous thrust faults to develop and the eastern subandean zone fault  approximately matches the geographic location of our upland/lowland break between clades of e. ockendeni and may be historically relevant. geological change in the miocene has recently been suggested as influential in south american eleutherodactylus frog diversification in general  <cit> . importantly, there is no obvious contemporary barrier between the extant clades of e. ockendeni, such as a major river as would be suggested by the river barrier hypothesis  <cit> ). the current lack of elevation difference in the distribution of two of the three clades suggests that elevational gradient differences are not driving the divergence . contemporary complex topography  does not seem to be relevant to patterns of deep divergence among clades, since divergence far predates existing topography, clades are not isolated by major topographic features, and the distribution of the upland clade extends through the headwaters of at least three major river valleys . further, the genetic diversity in e. ockendeni dates from the miocene and therefore cannot be attributed to climatic and associated vegetation changes of the past two million years, as has been suggested by proponents of the refuge theory  <cit> . however, recent population expansion in the upland clade may coincide with late pleistocene climate change.

cryptic species richness in e. ockendeni
our findings show that the leaflitter frog species e. ockendeni is three distinct species with apparently extreme morphological conservativism. furthermore, this area is only a portion of the species' range, which extends from southern colombia to southern peru  <cit>  and bolivia  <cit> , so the actual species diversity and richness within "e. ockendeni" is likely much greater than that demonstrated here. when the specimens were collected and catalogued for museum deposition, there was no apparent morphological difference among specimens and there has been no published indication that there would be multiple cryptic species within this species, except for a mention that e. ockendeni from cuisime  are smaller in snout-vent length than those collected in other areas of ecuador and peru  <cit> . it is clear that the divergence among each of the three clades is biologically real and not an artefact of stochastic variance in mtdna masking recent gene flow  <cit>  because our coalescent methods model best with no gene flow among lineages  and five nuclear microsatellite loci are significantly different between the upland and lowland clades. given this new molecular information, a detailed morphological revision of ecuadorean e. ockendeni is underway .

incidences of sympatric, parapatric, and allopatric cryptic species have been recently discovered in southeast asian frogs . also, although there are exceedingly few intraspecific molecular phylogenies of neotropical amphibians, those that do exist tend to encounter new species and/or previously unanticipated species diversity . these findings together suggest that widespread species of amphibians in the tropics have an evolutionarily history that is much more complicated than suggested by morphologies. consequently, attempts at biological conservation according to current estimates of the number of morphological "species" will drastically underestimate the actual biodiversity in this already species-rich region.

CONCLUSIONS
we found deep phylogenetic divisions among clades in this common leaflitter frog, e. ockendeni, suggestive of distinct species. based on microsatellite genotype profiles for distinct mitochondrial clades and modelling of historical gene flow, we suggest that there is complete reproductive isolation among these clades, even when they are sympatric. these cryptic species have an ancient divergence estimated to have originated in the miocene. diversification among these clades coincides approximately with periods of dramatic northern andean orogenesis and predates the andes at their current height. though multiple environmental occurrences surely have been historically influential, pleistocene climate change refuges as drivers of allopatric speciation are not relevant to extant specific diversification e. ockendeni. our research strongly suggests that current estimates for the renowned species richness in the upper amazon of frogs in general and eleutherodactylus in particular may be a substantial underestimate of the actual phyletic diversity present.
