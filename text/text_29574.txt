BACKGROUND
for owned dogs, veterinary records can provide extensive data sets for the estimation of demographic parameters such as age-specific survival and fecundity, age at first pregnancy and litter size . similar estimates are required for roaming dogs , in particular to assess the likely effect of proposed methods of population control, but far less data are currently available for such dogs.

with the spread of urbanisation throughout the developing world, the problem of roaming dogs in urban areas is likely to increase. frequent articles in the indian national press, for example, reflect the current concern about rabies and dog bite incidents, in particular those involving children. central to those discussions is the role of animal birth control , which has been adopted in many indian cities via the use of catch-neuter-release programmes directed at roaming dogs. opinions are divided as to the effectiveness of such programmes in controlling the number of roaming dogs  yet the data needed to assess and optimise their effectiveness are largely lacking. questionnaire surveys may provide demographic parameter estimates for owned dogs but little or no information on that component of the roaming dog population that is not owned. in this paper we suggest that, at little extra cost, data collection as part of the abc programme itself can provide some of that missing information.

as part of an abc programme run by help in suffering  in jaipur since  <dig>  dogs are caught by trained his catching teams for spaying by complete ovariohysterectomy and rabies vaccination. to date a total of over  <dig>  females have been spayed and vaccinated. month to month variation in the proportion of spayed females that were pregnant has shown that the breeding cycle of dogs liable to catching by the catching teams is annual rather than biannual  <cit> . in this paper we derive a maximum likelihood  estimate of the percentage of recruited females that become pregnant in any given year.

spayed females are individually marked using a tattoo within the ear and a small notch is made in the ear margin to visibly mark the individual at a distance as having been spayed. nevertheless spayed females are occasionally caught a second time when the ear notch is not noticed by the catching teams. dogs are also caught for veterinary treatment or for euthanasia if they are terminally ill or injured, so if a tattoo marking is noted at that time the interval between first and second catching events is also available. we use the frequency distribution of those intervals to derive a ml estimate of the annual survival of spayed females.

finally, we use estimates of litter size and age at first pregnancy from data collected in jaipur  <cit>  and a balance equation to calculate the probability of survival to age one for a female in a population that has reached carrying capacity and attained a stable age structure. taken together these estimates are sufficient for a simple leslie matrix model  <cit>  of the jaipur roaming dog population that can be used to assess the likely effect of future intervention.

RESULTS
fecundity
the ml estimate for pregnancy rate  is  <dig> %, with a 95% confidence interval from 44% to 51%. whelping date was assumed to be normally distributed. the ml estimate for mean whelping date was november 23rd with a standard deviation of  <dig> days. figure  <dig> illustrates the observed month to month variation in the percentage of females collected for sterilisation that were found to be pregnant and the month to month variation in the expected value of that percentage given by the ml estimates. figure  <dig> illustrates the variation, with pregnancy rate, of the likelihood maximised with respect to the mean and standard deviation of whelping date only and was used to derive the confidence interval on the pregnancy rate estimate.

survival
the ml estimate for annual survival of spayed females that are at least one year old is  <dig>  with a 95% confidence interval from  <dig>  to  <dig> . figure 3a illustrates the frequency distribution of intervals prior to a spayed female being caught a second time because the ear notch was missed and compares that to the distribution of intervals prior to a spayed female being caught a second time because of terminal illness or injury. it suggests the two distributions are similar, so the survival rate estimate was based on the frequency distribution of intervals prior to all second catching events, illustrated in figure 3b. in addition to the survival rate the likelihood function thus required parameters for the hazard rate  of being caught as a result of the ear notch being missed and as a result of terminal illness or injury. figure  <dig> illustrates the variation, with survival rate, of the likelihood maximised with respect to those two parameters only and was used to derive the confidence interval on the survival rate estimate.

juvenile survival
assuming the population has reached carrying capacity and attained a stable age structure, the following balance equation provides an estimate of first year survival, sj, under those conditions:

 sj=1−f⋅l⋅r−1−a) 

where f is the pregnancy rate, l the average number of females per litter, r and a the ages at recruitment and senility  and λ is the annual increase in the carrying capacity. we assume carrying capacity in jaipur has increased in proportion to the human population at about 4% per year over the period of the abc programme. from chawla and reece  <cit>  the average litter size in jaipur is  <dig>  so, assuming an equal sex ratio at birth, l equals  <dig> . assuming that females are fully recruited to the breeding population at age  <dig> and do not become pregnant after age  <dig> the above expression gives a value of  <dig>  for juvenile survival, sj, if the ml estimates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  are used for s and f. the calculated value of sj is insensitive to the assumed value of a, for example if females can become pregnant up to age  <dig> the estimate for sj is only slightly less at  <dig> . using estimates of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for s and sj gives a total expected lifespan of  <dig>  years at birth and  <dig>  years at one year old.

discussion
the world health organisation recognises that data on the ecology of street dogs are limited and that data collection needs to be extended to areas for which none exist  <cit> . the estimates reported here provide data for roaming dogs in a city that may be typical for north india in relation to dog demography.

our values for the fecundity of roaming dogs in jaipur are similar to published estimates. we estimate that in jaipur  <dig> % of female dogs aged one year and over have a litter in any given year. pal  <cit>  studied the ecology of roaming dogs on the outskirts of a town in west bengal over a period of four years. he showed that breeding occurs over a single season per year and observed  <dig> litters. the average dogs density over the study period was  <dig> per km <dig>  the study site covered  <dig>  km <dig> and the sex ratio was  <dig> : <dig> males to females, so the number of litters as a percentage of the average number of adult females present was 51%. butler and bingham  <cit> , working in rural zimbabwe, state that a female had a litter every  <dig>  years, equivalent to  <dig>  litters per female per year. kitala et al  <cit>  present estimates from a questionnaire survey in machakos district, kenya. they report that 54% of female dogs had a litter during the year and an average fecundity of  <dig>  female pups per female per year. our estimate of pregnancy rate combined with the estimate of  <dig>  females per litter from chawla & reece  <cit>  gives an average fecundity of  <dig> .

we have been unable to locate many comparable estimates for annual survival of roaming dogs in the urban environment. we estimate adult annual survival at 70% for spayed females. pal  <cit>  observed only  <dig> deaths over his four-year study period, suggesting an adult annual survival of over 91%. however the mean age at death observed for adult dogs  was only  <dig>  years. for dogs surviving to  <dig> months the mean age at death corresponding to our estimate of 70% adult annual survival is  <dig> years. this suggests that adult survival was lower than in jaipur and that some deaths were not observed. his estimate of 18% for first year survival is also less than our estimate of 25% for first year survival when the jaipur population was at carrying capacity, supporting his contention that his local population was being maintained by immigration.

data from table  <dig> in kitala et al  <cit>  suggest a value of about 60% for adult female annual survival, again lower than our estimate, despite their observation that all dogs observed were owned. beck  <cit>  sets an upper bound of 77% on survival of roaming dogs in baltimore by comparing the number of dogs known to have died over a year to the estimated total number in the city. data in his table  <dig> give an estimate of 70% for annual survival of dogs at least one year old, thus identical to our estimate for spayed females at least one year old. however his data suggest that survival is not constant, increasing to a maximum of 87% for dogs from two to three years old and reducing thereafter. the same may apply to dogs in jaipur but survival was assumed to be constant to allow for estimation by the method used.

beran  <cit>  noted that dogs less than one year old are over represented in canine rabies cases. thus it should follow that controlling rabies in canine populations with limited reproductive performance, such as that of jaipur, is easier than in populations with a more rapid turnover. unsurprisingly the reproductive performance reported for pet dogs is much higher with lower pup mortality  <cit> . these authors note that litter size in bitches increases up to 3– <dig> years of age and is lower in young animals. the longevity figures reported here may be one reason why the fecundity of roaming females is low since these dogs are breeding at ages below the age at which they have largest litters.

although the set of estimated parameters is necessarily simplified it is sufficient to establish an age-structured model for the female component of the jaipur roaming dog population. the number of female spays is known accurately so the transfer of dogs from the fecund to sterile populations can be included in the model. the results thus provide the potential to generate a trajectory of population size, given a scenario of future spaying effort. such a trajectory depends on how the intervention itself affects survival, age at first pregnancy and pregnancy rate. although the data provide in principle the means to monitor changes in pregnancy and adult survival, the potential to estimate juvenile survival via the balance equation is no longer available once the population has been deflected to below carrying capacity. however, changes in the population structure observed since the outset of the abc programme can be compared to the model output in order to place constraints on the parameter values. for example the percentage spayed can be observed as part of the intervention effort itself and hence monitored accurately without the need for extra resources.

his is currently using an age-structured model of the jaipur roaming dog population based on these results to guide future intervention, however two main issues remain to be addressed in order to reduce uncertainty about the projections. one is how the roaming dogs that can be accessed by the catching teams differ in their survival and fecundity from those dogs the teams are unable to catch and the other is the degree to which spaying itself may increase female survival.

CONCLUSIONS
the data used to derive the estimates presented here resulted from careful recording of information provided by the current intervention itself. irrespective of information obtained prior to intervention, the fact that such data are able to generate usable estimates suggests that individual identification of the dogs treated, recording the time and location of each catching event and recording the reproductive condition of each dog is worthwhile and should form part of any monitoring programme used for evaluation. furthermore, where the abc programme involves catching dogs on the street, those involved in the catching process should be provided with the means to record the numbers of pups, males, females and lactating females encountered, with and without ear notches, as part of that process. comparison of the observed structure of the population with that predicted by a simulation model will place constraints on the demographic parameter values. the number of ear-notched animals released is accurately known so, given an estimate of their rate of survival, their observed proportion in the population also allows the size of that population to be monitored as the intervention progresses.
