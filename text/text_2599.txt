BACKGROUND
cholangiocytes have a low replicative activity in the normal state  <cit> , but they proliferate or undergo apoptosis in cholangiopathies  <cit> , progressive liver disorders characterized by an abnormal balance between cholangiocyte proliferation and death, leading to vanishing of intrahepatic bile ducts  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that sex hormones play a role in the pathogenesis of some cholangiopathies  <cit> . in particular, the most common of them, primary biliary cirrhosis , is more common in women, and its clinical outbreak is typically after menopause  <cit> . the low expression of estrogen receptor alpha in pbc and their disappearance in the advanced histological stages of this disease suggests that an estrogenic deficiency could favor the evolution of pbc toward ductopenia  <cit> . furthermore, a study demonstrated that:  ovariectomy to bdl female rats induced a decrease in intrahepatic ductal mass; and  administration of 17-β estradiol during bdl to ovariectomized rats prevented the decrease in the number of bile ducts  <cit> .

prolactin is a pituitary hormone and a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival in a number of cells  <cit> . two different isoforms of the prolactin receptor exist: they are both encoded by a single gene, by which the two isoforms  are obtained by alternative splicing  <cit> . the long and short forms are both membrane bound receptors with an identical binding site for prolactin, but differ in the length of their cytoplasmic tail  <cit> . prolactin binding to the long or short form of prolactin receptors activates different signaling pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase   <cit> , jak/stat  <cit> , and ca2+/pkc  <cit> . while long prolactin receptors activate several signaling pathways including jak/stat  <cit> , the short isoform of prolactin receptor activates various kinases and interacts with 17-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase pathways  <cit> . the long form of the prolactin receptor mediates activation of the ca2+-dependent pkc signaling in a number of cells  <cit> .

although studies have shown differences in the expression of prolactin receptors between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes of normal and cholestatic livers  <cit> , no information exists on the role of prolactin on the regulation of cholangiocyte growth. the rationale for using cholangiocytes from female rats is based on the fact that women are preferentially affected by specific cholestatic liver diseases including pbc  <cit> . we addressed these questions:  do normal and bdl female and male cholangiocytes express prolactin receptors?  does in vivo administration of prolactin to normal female and male rats increase cholangiocyte proliferation?  are prolactin effects on normal cholangiocyte proliferation of female rats associated with increased intracellular ca2+  levels and differential phosphorylation of ca2+-dependent pkc isoforms   <cit> ?  does the in vivo administration of an anti-prolactin antibody to bdl female and male rats inhibit cholangiocyte hyperplasia? and  do female cholangiocytes express the message and protein for prolactin and secrete prolactin?

RESULTS
cholangiocytes express prolactin receptors
immunohistochemistry in liver sections from normal and bdl female and male rats shows that cholangiocytes express prolactin receptors . by immunofluorescence, immunoreactivity for prolactin receptor is co-localized with the expression of cytokeratin- <dig>   <cit>  ; in the merged photograph there is co-localization of prolactin receptor and ck- <dig> . no immunohistochemical reaction was observed when a consecutive liver section of the same field was incubated with non-immune serum . parallel to other studies  <cit> , prolactin receptors are also expressed by hepatocytes from normal and bdl female and male rats .

by rt-pcr, normal and bdl female cholangiocytes expressed the expected molecular weight band for the message for the short  and long  form of prolactin receptor, and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase   . sequence analysis of the rt-pcr fragments shows that both the rat short and long prolactin receptors are 98% homologous to the short   <cit>  and long rat prolactin receptor mrnas   <cit> . by real time pcr, normal female cholangiocytes express both the short and long form of prolactin receptor mrna  ; following bdl, the expression of the short and long form of prolactin receptor mrna significantly increased in purified female cholangiocytes .

effect of in vivo administration of prolactin to normal rats on serum prolactin levels, portal inflammation, necrosis and cholangiocyte apoptosis and proliferation
chronic in vivo administration of prolactin to normal female rats increased prolactin serum levels compared to normal rats treated with nacl for  <dig> week . h&e staining of paraffin-embedded liver sections demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the degree of portal inflammation, necrosis, apoptosis and lobular damage between nacl- and prolactin-treated normal female rats . administration of prolactin to normal female rats increased the number of proliferating cellular nuclear antigen - and ck-19-positive cholangiocytes compared with normal rats treated with nacl . prolonged administration of prolactin to normal male rats did not change intrahepatic ductal mass   <cit>  compared to normal male rats treated with nacl .

inflammation, necrosis, lobular damage and apoptosis were evaluated in paraffin embedded liver sections  stained with hematoxylin and eosin. in vivo administration of prolactin to normal rats for  <dig> week increased prolactin serum levels but did not alter liver inflammation, necrosis, lobular damage or apoptosis compared to nacl-treated normal female rats. the administration of anti-prolactin antibody to bdl female rats decreased prolactin serum levels and ameliorated portal inflammation, necrosis and lobular damage compared to bdl rats treated with non-immune serum for  <dig> week. data on prolactin serum levels are mean ± sem of  <dig> samples from  <dig> different rats. data  related to the measurement of inflammation, necrosis, lobular damage and cholangiocyte apoptosis are obtained from the analysis of  <dig> slides per portal tract. *p <  <dig>  vs. its corresponding value from bdl rats treated with non-immune serum.

effect of prolactin on i levels and phosphorylation of ca2+-dependent pkc isoforms in normal female cholangiocytes
prolactin induced a sustained increase in i levels in normal female cholangiocytes compared with cholangiocytes treated with  <dig> % bsa . a calcium tracing, which is the average of three independent measurements, is shown in figure  <dig> . as the tracing shows there is no change in fluorescence during the basal measurement period that demonstrates that the cells do not leak as influx of extracellular calcium would alter fluorescence . cholangiocyte responsiveness to the ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin  <cit> , is shown in figure  <dig> .

when purified female cholangiocytes were treated with prolactin, there was an increase in the phosphorylation of pkcβ-i and a decrease in pkcα phosphorylation ; no significant changes in the phosphorylation of pkcβ-ii and pkcγ were observed in normal female cholangiocytes treated with prolactin .

effect of in vivo administration of anti-prolactin antibody on cholangiocyte proliferation of bdl rats
cholangiocytes express prolactin
the administration of anti-prolactin antibody to bdl female rats decreased prolactin serum levels and ameliorates portal inflammation, necrosis and lobular damage compared to bdl rats treated with non-immune serum for  <dig> week . administration of anti-prolactin antibody to bdl female rats decreased the number of pcna- and ck-19-positive positive cholangiocytes compared to liver sections from bdl rats treated with non-immune serum . prolonged administration of anti-prolactin antibody to bdl male rats did not change intrahepatic ductal mass   <cit>  compared to bdl male rats treated non-immune serum .

by immunohistochemistry in liver sections, bile ducts from normal and bdl female rats express the protein for prolactin . no staining was seen when a consecutive liver section of the same field was incubated with non-immune serum . by real time pcr, we have demonstrated that:  female normal cholangiocytes express prolactin mrna at low levels ;  following bdl, prolactin mrna markedly increased in female cholangiocytes ; and  primary cultures of normal and bdl female cholangiocytes secrete prolactin [ <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml ; and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml ; n = 7).

discussion
our study demonstrates that prolactin regulates the growth of female cholangiocytes presumably by an autocrine mechanism. we first demonstrated in liver sections that cholangiocytes from normal and bdl female and male rats express prolactin receptors. by real time pcr:  normal female cholangiocytes expressed both the short and long form of prolactin receptor mrna; and  following bdl, the expression of the short and long form of prolactin receptors increased in female cholangiocytes. our data on cholangiocyte prolactin receptor expression are slightly different to those of previous studies in albino mongrel rats  <cit>  showing that:  normal isolated intrahepatic bile duct units  predominantly express the message for the long form of the prolactin receptor, whereas the expression of the short form of the prolactin receptor is very low or absent  <cit> ; and  following bdl, the genetic expression of the long form markedly increases in ibdu whereas the short form of prolactin receptor slightly increased in ibdu  <cit> . the slight difference between these data is presumably due to the different strain of rats used in our studies  and the other studies   <cit> . prolactin receptors are expressed by rat hepatocytes in the sinusoidal domain of cellular membranes and in perinuclear areas  <cit> . prolactin receptors are also expressed by human hepatocytes of patients with obstructive jaundice of different etiology, but prolactin receptor expression is lower in hepatocytes compared to human cholangiocytes  <cit> . although these previous studies have shown that cholangiocytes express prolactin receptors  <cit> , no information exists on the role of prolactin in the regulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia.

we next performed in vivo studies and demonstrated that the administration of:  prolactin to normal female rats induces cholangiocyte hyperplasia devoid of portal inflammation and hepatic damage; and  anti-prolactin antibody to bdl female rats decreases cholangiocyte proliferation and ameliorates portal inflammation and hepatic damage. the most likely explanation why prolactin increased cholangiocyte growth but not portal inflammation and hepatic damage in normal rats is that prolactin induces cholangiocyte hyperplasia as a direct effect and not as a consequence of obstructive cholestasis , a pathological condition associated with increased portal inflammation  <cit> . in support of our findings, a number of studies have shown that certain bile acids, vascular endothelial growth factor and forskolin induce cholangiocyte hyperplasia devoid of apoptosis, necrosis, hepatic damage or portal inflammation  <cit> . however, in bdl, which is accompanied by an inflammatory response along with cholestasis  <cit> , the blocking of prolactin with an antibody reduces hepatic damage and cholangiocyte proliferation along with suppression of some inflammatory responses.

concomitant with enhanced ductal hyperplasia, there was increased prolactin serum levels in normal female rats treated with prolactin compared to nacl treated rats. in bdl female rats, the serum levels of prolactin increased approximately 15-fold as compared to the levels of normal female rats. moreover, the administration of anti-prolactin antibody to bdl rats reduces not only cholangiocyte proliferation but also prolactin serum levels. we suggest that changes in prolactin serum levels may be important in the regulation of cholangiocyte growth in chronic cholestatic liver diseases.

in different cell types, prolactin effects are mediated by an increase in ca2+ levels and pkc activation  <cit> . thus, we evaluated the role of the ca2+/pkc signaling pathway in prolactin regulation of cholangiocyte hyperplasia. our results show that i levels are increased in normal female cholangiocytes after in vitro prolactin stimulation as compared to cholangiocytes stimulated with bsa. from our previous experience with purified cholangiocytes and cholangiocarcinoma cell lines we do not expect a traditional calcium spike  <cit> . in our previous studies  <cit> , we demonstrated that the ca2+ dynamics of cholangiocytes are in general slower and not characterized by a ca2+ spike  <cit> . the method that we currently employ results in ca2+ measurements  <cit> , which are an average signal of  <dig>  cells rather than typical single cell measurements  <cit> . this approach gives us similar data  <cit>  to that obtained with measurements, which were made in single cells loaded with fluo-3am  <cit> . since the measurements are taken in a large number of cells the cellular response to prolactin is not synchronized in the studies. thus, any peak present will be muted and spread out over time, which is a factor contributing to the slow drift observed. in support of our finding, ducret et al. demonstrated a similar slow response calcium wave due to prolactin in glia cells  <cit> .

we next evaluated if prolactin stimulation of cholangiocyte proliferation was coupled with phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of specific ca2+-dependent pkc isoforms. our finding that prolactin stimulation of normal female cholangiocyte proliferation is associated with concomitant increased  and decreased  pkc phosphorylation suggests that a counterbalancing system between pckβ isoform and pkcα may regulate cholangiocyte proliferation following prolactin stimulation. in support of this concept, while enhanced phosphorylation of pkcβ-ii mediates the activation of secretin-stimulated ductal secretion  <cit>    <cit>  of bdl rats, increased phosphorylation of pkcα  is associated with reduced cholangiocyte growth  <cit> . in agreement with the view, in hematopoietic  <cit>  and glioma  <cit>  cells, the activation of pkcβ-i and β ii isoforms leads to an increase in cell proliferation. furthermore, in intestinal cell lines the overexpression and/or activation of pkcα decreases cell growth and tumorigenicity  <cit> . taken together, our studies show that the ca2+/pkcβ-i and α signaling pathway is one of the players involved in prolactin regulation of cholangiocyte proliferation, but did not evaluate if other pathways  modulate prolactin effects on cholangiocyte growth. also, our studies do not establish which isoform  of the prolactin receptor mediates the effects of prolactin on cholangiocyte growth. however, based upon previous studies showing that the long form of prolactin receptor mediates increases in i in other cells  <cit> , we propose that the long form of the prolactin receptor may be the major player in prolactin modulation of cholangiocyte growth.

next, we demonstrated that normal and bdl female cholangiocytes express the message and protein for prolactin and secrete prolactin in primary cultures. the reason why prolactin secretion is similar in normal and bdl female cholangiocytes  may be due to post-transcriptional events  affecting the translation of the prolactin message. on the basis of these findings, although our studies do not provide direct evidence for the following concept, we propose that prolactin may regulate cholangiocyte proliferation by an autocrine mechanism . in agreement with the latter concept, a number of cells including mammary epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and cancer cell lines  <cit>  secrete prolactin, thus regulating their functions. furthermore, in support of the concept that prolactin regulates cholangiocyte proliferation by an autocrine mechanism, we have previously shown that cholangiocytes express/secrete neurotrophins  <cit> , vascular endothelial growth factor  <cit>  and serotonin  <cit> , thus regulating intrahepatic ductal mass by an autocrine mechanism  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary this study has shown that:  cholangiocytes express both isoforms  of the receptor for prolactin;  prolactin has a trophic effect on the growth of normal female cholangiocytes by phosphorylation of pkcβ-i and dephosphorylation of pkcα; and  cholangiocytes express the message/protein for and secrete prolactin, findings suggesting that prolactin participates, by an autocrine mechanism, in the modulation of cholangiocyte proliferation. prolactin may be an important therapeutic approach for the management of cholangiopathies.
