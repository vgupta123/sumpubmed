BACKGROUND
anthrax refers to those clinical syndromes caused by the spore-forming, gram-positive organism, bacillus anthracis  <cit> . classically, anthrax presents as one of three syndromes: cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary  <cit> . pulmonary anthrax is among the most feared of infectious diseases; once clinical symptoms have developed, mortality remains high even with appropriate treatment. much of the pathogenesis of anthrax is currently attributed to two toxins, each of which is produced from two of three proteins synthesized by the bacillary form of the organism: protective antigen , edema factor , and lethal factor   <cit> . pa combines with either lf to form lethal toxin , or with ef to form edema toxin   <cit> . lt received its name as it was thought to be the principal virulence determinant responsible for the most deleterious sequelae of anthrax infection  <cit> . et was so named as it caused localized edema, in vivo, upon subcutaneous injection  <cit> .

the mechanisms through which et elicits host cell responses are incompletely understood. pa is the receptor binding moiety of the toxin complex. after binding to one of two surface receptors, endothelial marker- <dig> /anthrax receptor  <dig>  or capillary morphogenesis protein- <dig> /anthrax receptor  <dig> , pa is cleaved into a  <dig> kda fragment by surface proteases, such as furin  <cit> . antxr <dig> is present in the epithelial cells lining the respiratory pathway, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as being selectively upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and tumorigenesis  <cit> . in contrast, antxr <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in most human tissues  <cit> . these pa fragments oligomerize into ring-shaped heptamers, to which ef binds  <cit> . the entire complex then undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . this endosome is acidified, resulting in conformational changes, which in turn, permit insertion of the multiprotein complex comprised of ef and the pa cleavage product into the endosomal membrane  <cit> . ef is then translocated to the cytosol, where it exerts its biological effects  <cit> . ef is one of four known bacterial products that are intrinsic adenyl cyclases  <cit> . its catalytic rate is 100-fold higher than any mammalian equivalent  <cit> . the current understanding is that most of the effects of ef are due to elevated levels of mislocalized camp  <cit> . et has been demonstrated to increase camp in a variety of cell types, including jurkat cells, hela cells, monocytes, and most relevant to the current studies, ecs and polymorphonuclear leukocytes  <cit> . camp is a ubiquitous secondary messenger with multiple downstream effectors, including protein kinase a  and protein activated by camp , a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for ras-related protein  <dig>   <cit> . there are two epac variants, epac <dig> and epac <dig>  each of which has a distinct domain structure and tissue-specific expression  <cit> . the epac1-rap <dig> pathway has been implicated in such cellular processes as vascular endothelial -cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion  <cit> , integrin mediated adhesion  <cit> , monocyte chemotaxis  <cit> , ca2+-induced exocytosis  <cit> , and fcγ-receptor mediated phagocytosis  <cit> . whether et might also exert biological effects independent of camp is unknown.

highly purified, recombinant et is lethal to mice  <cit>  at lower doses than is lt  <cit> . curiously, edema was absent in these mice at the microscopic level  <cit> . et suppresses the t-lymphocyte secretion of the pmn chemoattractant, interleukin - <dig>  <cit> . et also impairs pmn phagocytosis and superoxide production  <cit> . in ec-free systems, investigators have demonstrated that et increases pmn chemotaxis  <cit> , whereas others have shown an inhibitory effect  <cit> . of relevance to the current report, et also decreases ec chemotaxis  <cit> .

in  <dig>  renewed interest in pulmonary anthrax was generated when  <dig> bioterrorism-related cases were described  <cit> . a unifying feature of these cases was a normal to slightly elevated circulating leukocyte count in the face of relatively high levels of bacteremia  <cit> . although circulating pmns were abundant, lung tissues from these patients were notable for a lack of intra-alveolar inflammatory infiltrates  <cit> . the pleural fluid of several patients contained scant pmns. similarly, in african green monkeys exposed to anthrax spores, the pulmonary interstitium was expanded by fibrin and edema, but contained few pmns  <cit> . these combined data suggest an impaired delivery of circulating pmns to extravascular sites of infection. since pmns are an essential host defense against bacterial infection, a survival advantage would be conferred to any infecting organism that could disable these phagocytic cells.

from its name, most observers would intuit that et increases edema formation, i.e., the paracellular passage of fluid and macromolecules. however, agents that increase intracellular camp are known to enhance ec-ec adhesion, tighten the paracellular pathway, and promote barrier integrity  <cit> . he et al found that basal levels of camp are necessary to maintain barrier function under resting conditions  <cit> . multiple investigators have demonstrated that pharmacologic agents which increase camp or behave as camp analogues in ecs enhance barrier function  <cit> . prior studies which have looked at et effects on pmn chemotaxis have done so in ec-free systems, and therefore did not examine whether et might impair pmn migration to target tissues through an effect on the endothelium. in the current study, we have defined a novel mechanism through which a bacteria-derived toxin, et, may indirectly, through the counter-regulation of the endothelial paracellular pathway, impair extravasation of pmns into tissues.

RESULTS
et protects against il-8-stimulated transendothelial migration  of pmns
since et directly stimulates ecs to increase camp  <cit> , which in turn, enhances endothelial barrier integrity  <cit> , we asked whether et might decrease tem of pmns. pretreatment of monolayers of human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung  with et decreased il-8-stimulated tem by ~ 60% . neither ef nor pa alone were able to reproduce the et effect . for these calculations, total fluorescence associated with pmns placed in each upper compartment represented 100% migration while % migration was calculated as fluorescence in the lower compartment/fluorescence in the upper compartment × 100%.

et acts at the level of the ec to decrease il-8-driven tem of pmns
since et decreased the tem of pmns , we asked whether it acted directly on pmns or indirectly via the ec response. when pmns were co-incubated with et in the absence of ecs, et at the same concentration that impaired tem  did not decrease il-8-driven pmn chemotaxis compared to medium controls . these data indicate that the ability of et to diminish tem of pmns cannot be explained through a direct effect on pmns. since these pmns were preloaded with the fluoroprobe, calcein-am, a known intracellular ca2+-binder  <cit> , and the host response to et is calmodulin- and ca <dig> + -dependent  <cit> , we asked whether calcein-am might diminish pmn responsiveness to et. the impact of et on il- <dig> driven chemotaxis of unlabeled pmns was assessed. in these studies, il- <dig> increased pmn chemotaxis ~  <dig> -fold compared to the simultaneous medium controls . the addition of et did not alter pmn chemotaxis compared to pmns incubated with il- <dig> alone. these data confirm those generated in our studies with calcein-am-labeled pmns  and further support exclusion of a direct et effect on pmns.

to establish whether the ability of et to decrease il-8-driven tem of pmns was mediated indirectly through the ec response, we measured the effect of et on movement of a permeability tracer across the endothelia. in a subconfluent hmvec-l monolayers, where the average baseline transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux was  <dig>   pmol/h, et, at increasing concentrations, dose-dependently decreased mean  transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux compared to the simultaneous medium controls . et concentrations as low as  <dig> ng/ml: <dig> ng/ml diminished transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux. these data indicate that et restricts passage of macromolecules through the same endothelial paracellular pathway through which pmns migrate. to provide additional evidence that et decreases il-8-driven tem of pmns through the ec response, we tested whether et might protect against agonist-induced barrier disruption. in confluent hmvec-ls where the mean  baseline transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux was  <dig>   pmol/h, both human recombinant tumor necrosis factor -α and bacterial lipopolysaccharide , each at  <dig> ng/ml, increased  <dig> c-albumin flux > 2-fold compared to the simultaneous medium controls . when lps and tnf-α were coadministered with et at  <dig> ng/ml: <dig> ng/ml, the increase in transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux in response to either lps or tnf-α was decreased by ≥ 60% and ~ 45%, respectively, compared to albumin flux in response to each respective agonist alone . these data indicate that et provides partial protection against both endogenous host and exogenous bacteria-derived mediators of endothelial barrier disruption through its action on ecs.

the effect of et on il- <dig> driven tem of pmns is pka-independent
since et is an adenyl cyclase that increases camp, we asked whether the ability of et to diminish tem of pmns might be mediated through ec-generated pka. first, et was tested for its ability to increase pka activity in hmvec-ls. et at  <dig> ng/ml: <dig> ng/ml, increased pka activity . when ecs were exposed for increasing times  to a fixed concentration of et , pka activity was increased at  <dig> h, returning to basal levels at ≤  <dig> h . two structurally dissimilar pka inhibitors, h- <dig> and kt- <dig>  were then tested for their ability to counteract the et effect on tem. to confirm that h- <dig> and kt- <dig> impaired pka activity in hmvec-ls, we examined et-induced phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein , a direct pka substrate  <cit> . initially, phospho-creb  signal was normalized to total creb. however, stripping of the anti-pcreb antibody was incomplete and inconsistent. consequently, pcreb was normalized to β-tubulin. h- <dig> and kt- <dig> each diminished et-induced creb phosphorylation . quantitative densitometry was performed on each of these same blots. h- <dig> and kt- <dig> both completely blocked phosphorylation of creb normalized to β-tubulin compared to the simultaneous medium controls , indicating their effectiveness as inhibitors of pka in hmvec-ls. in these experiments, il- <dig>  increased tem of pmns ~ 4-fold when compared to simultaneous medium controls . pretreatment of ecs with either h- <dig>  or kt- <dig>  alone had no effect on tem in the presence or absence of il- <dig> . pretreatment of ecs with et  decreased il-8-driven tem of pmns by ~ 45%. h- <dig> and kt- <dig> each failed to reverse the et effect; i.e., the effect of either agent co-administered with et was not significantly different than et alone . although h- <dig> and kt- <dig> each completely blocked et-induced increments in pka activity as measured by pcreb/β-tubulin ratios , these same inhibitors had no impact on the et-induced reduction of tem . taken together, these data do not support a pka-mediated et effect on tem.

forskolin  and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine  fail to reproduce the et effect on il-8-driven tem of pmns
to provide further evidence that et does not decrease tem of pmns through camp or pka activity, two distinct interventions known to increase camp, fsk and ibmx, each were introduced. to confirm that fsk and ibmx increased pka activity in hmvec-ls, we first examined fsk- and ibmx- stimulated phosphorylation of creb at  <dig> h . fsk  and ibmx  each increased phosphorylation of creb normalized to β-tubulin when compared to the simultaneous medium control . previous investigators have demonstrated that fsk and ibmx cause maximal increases of camp at  <dig>  h with a decrease by  <dig> h  <cit> ; in our studies, phosphorylation of creb normalized to β-tubulin was elevated but not significantly different from the effect at the later time point . next, we investigated the effects of fsk and ibmx on il-8-driven tem. in these experiments, il- <dig>  increased tem of pmns ~ 6-fold compared to simultaneous medium control . pretreatment of ecs with et decreased tem of pmns by ~ 50%. neither fsk nor ibmx could reconstitute the et effect on il- <dig> driven tem of pmns, either at  <dig>  h  or at  <dig> h . although fsk and ibmx each upregulated pka activity comparable to that seen after et treatment , none could decrease tem . again, these combined data do not support a camp/pka-dependent mechanism through which et inhibits tem of pmns.

discussion
in our studies, we have found that et decreases il-8-driven tem of pmns across human lung microvascular endothelia. we asked whether the observed et effect could be attributed to action on either the pmn and/or endothelium. we found that et blocked tem even when pmns were not directly exposed to et  and required the presence of both ef and pa . at the same concentrations, et did not inhibit pmn chemotaxis in an ec-free system . in contrast, we found that et decreased  <dig> c-albumin flux across preconfluent endothelia . further, et attenuated the increase in  <dig> c-albumin flux provoked by both endogenous  and exogenous  mediators of barrier disruption . prior inhibition of pka with h- <dig> or kt- <dig> did not reverse the et effect on tem , and agents demonstrated to elevate intracellular levels of camp in hmvec-ls  could not reconstitute the et effect . these combined data indicate that et diminishes tem of pmns at the level of the endothelial paracellular pathway and does so independent of via camp/pka activity.

several studies have examined the direct effect of et on in vitro pmn function. o'brien et al found that et inhibited pmn phagocytosis of opsonized b. anthracis  <cit> . pretreatment of pmns with et profoundly reduced superoxide production in response to either lps or muramyl dipeptide. crawford et al demonstrated that et impaired pmn nadph oxidase activation and downstream n-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine -induced superoxide production  <cit> . taken together, these studies indicate that et down-regulates pmn phagocytic and oxidative functions. other studies have focused on the impact of et on pmn chemotaxis and migration  <cit> . in the current studies, et did not alter the pmn chemotactic response to il- <dig> in an ec-free system . to address concerns that calcein is a ca2+-binder and would interfere with any ca2+-mediated et effect, these experiments were performed in the absence of the fluoroprobe. even in the absence of calcein, et had no effect on il- <dig> chemotaxis of pmns . chemotaxis was not as vigorous in the latter experiment, and this may be secondary to differences in methodology; mainly the use of a modified boyden chambers, a shorter incubation time, as well as a different means of measuring pmn migration.

wade et al found that et stimulated directed neutrophil migration without having any effect on unstimulated random migration  <cit> . they also found that although et increased camp in pmns, the absolute level of that increase was < 1% of that caused by the bordetella pertussis toxin. in contrast, szarowicz et al found that et reduces chemoattractant-stimulated pmn actin assembly, chemokinesis, chemotaxis and polarization  <cit> . in pmns, et provoked a > 50-fold increase in camp and a 4-fold increase in pka phosphorylation. the differences between our findings and these other reports may be attributed to dissimilar techniques. for instance, wade et al measured chemotaxis of pmns preincubated for  <dig> h with et in an agarose-gel based system, both of which were ec-free  <cit> , whereas szarowicz's group utilized video microscopy to study adherence of pmns preincubated for  <dig> h with et to a fibronectin-coated surface  <cit> . to our knowledge, none of these previous reports studied pmn migration in the context of the endothelial paracellular pathway. another potential explanation for these disparities may be due to differences in potency of various ef preparations and their abilities to generate camp. of note, the ef preparation offered by list biologics is the least potent .

far less is known about the direct effect of et on ecs. hong et al demonstrated that et reorganizes the cytoskeleton and inhibits chemotaxis of human microvascular ecs  <cit> . tessier's group found that et induces a gradual increase in transendothelial electrical resistance  across human umbilical vein ec monolayers cultured on collagen-coated inserts. they concluded that et-induced edema could not be accounted for by the direct effect of et on the endothelium  <cit> . of interest, in our experimental systems for both tem of pmns and transendothelial  <dig> c-albumin flux, the ecs were similarly cultured on collagen-impregnated filters. although tessier et al studied teer, their experiments did not include transendothelial flux of a permeability tracer or tem of pmns.

et is an intrinsic adenyl cyclase that increases camp  <cit> . data exists to support a camp-mediated mechanism underlying the et effect on tem of pmns. moy et al found that camp agonists attenuated the ability of thrombin to increase permeability  <cit> . similarly, fukuhara et al found that camp agonists decreased cell permeability and enhanced vascular ec-ec adhesion  <cit> . in ecs, camp targets multiple downstream signaling molecules that might promote endothelial barrier integrity, including pka  <cit>  and epac <dig>  <cit> .

one key effector of camp is pka  <cit> . pka has been shown to inhibit myosin-based contractility through phosphorylation of myosin-light-chain-kinase, thereby decreasing its activity  <cit> . pka also inhibits rhoa activity, stabilizes microtubules, reorganizes cortical actin and strengthens tight junctions through phosphorylation of vasodilator stimulated protein   <cit> . in our studies, we found that et activates pka in hmvec-ls in a dose- and time- dependent manner . although et increases ec pka activity, its inhibitory effect on tem could not be ascribed to pka activity. two structurally dissimilar pharmacologic inhibitors of pka, h- <dig> and kt- <dig>  each failed to attenuate the et-induced decrease in il-8-driven tem of pmns . further, we were unable to reproduce the et effect on tem with either of two structurally and functionally distinct pharmacologic agents each known to increase camp, fsk or ibmx . taken together, these data indicate that the mechanism through which et counter-regulates il-8-driven tem of pmns cannot be explained solely through camp/pka activation.

another downstream target for camp is epac <dig>  which is a gef for the ras gtpase, rap <dig>  <cit> . like pka activity, the epac1-rap <dig> pathway also enhances endothelial barrier function  <cit> . the epac1-specific analog 8cpt-2'o-me-camp, which directly activates epac <dig> while bypassing pka, has been shown to decrease permeability of endothelial cell monolayers, an effect which is ablated by prior sirna-induced epac <dig> knockdown  <cit> . birukova et al  <cit>  and fukuhara et al  <cit>  both demonstrated that activation of epac <dig> attenuated thrombin-induced increases in permeability. as in the case of pka, the mechanism by which epac <dig> improves barrier function is still being elucidated. potential epac <dig> targets include activation of vasp, as well as activation of arap <dig>  which in turn is a gef for rhoa, and vinculin, which supports ec-ec adherens junctions through association with α-catenin  <cit> . as pka inhibition did not impair the et effect on tem , one potential pathway is through epac1-rap <dig> and its effectors.

since et evokes biological responses in both pmns and ecs, it was unclear as to whether the ability of et to regulate tem of pmns could be ascribed to its impact on pmns, ecs, or both. although prior studies had demonstrated that et directly influenced pmn chemotaxis, in our experiments, it did not . further, et diminished tem of pmns never exposed to et . finally, not only did et decrease the paracellular movement of pmns , but of a permeability tracer as well . these combined data indicate that et counter-regulates pmn diapedesis exclusively through its effects on the endothelium. further support of this concept is offered by wittchen et al, who reported direct activation of rap <dig> in ec monolayers decreased both their permeability as well as tem of leukocytes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have found that anthrax-derived et impedes il- <dig> driven movement of pmns across an ec monolayer, as well as attenuates the increase of transendothelial  <dig> c albumin flux induced by tnf-α and lps, likely as a direct effect of et on ec-ec adhesion. this ability to counter-regulate paracellular pathway function could not be ascribed to camp/pka activity. whether this novel pathophysiology for anthrax can be extended to other pathogenic bacteria and their toxins requires further study.
