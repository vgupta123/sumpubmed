BACKGROUND
soybean  is a major world crop and is the second most cultivated crop in the u.s.a. following maize. soybean production contributes billions of dollars annually to the national economy, providing approximately  <dig> billion dollars in  <dig> . limitations on maximum production are largely due to disease pressures that reduce yield. several species of fusarium have been associated with soybean, causing seed and seedling diseases, root rot, and vascular wilt . f. oxysporum schltdl. is a fungal soil-borne facultative parasite present worldwide  <cit>  and is the most common species isolated from soybean roots in iowa and other soybean-producing regions in north america  <cit> . f. oxysporum is known to consist of many “cryptic species” and, as such, it is often referred as the “f. oxysporum species complex” . recently, significant variation in aggressiveness was observed among isolates within the fosc collected from soybean roots in iowa  <cit> . some of these isolates caused severe root rot and dumping-off, other isolates were weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic.

management of soil-borne diseases like fusarium root rot and wilt disease depends primarily on seed treatments and genetic resistance. seed treatments are only effective during emergence and the seedling stages. cultural practices can help in managing root rots, but these are often not adequate. moreover, it seems clear that managing fusarium root rot in the long-term will depend on improvements in molecular breeding for resistant genotypes  <cit> .

soybean resistance to other fusarium species has been identified. particularly high levels of resistance to f. graminearum have been found in the soybean cultivar conrad, and putative qtl associated with resistance to f. graminearum have been detected  <cit> . previous work has identified qtl associated with resistance to sudden death syndrome , caused by f. virguliforme and other species, in ripley  <cit>  and forrest  <cit>  soybean genotypes. progress in breeding for resistance will be improved through the analysis of new and consistent qtl for fusarium root rot and wilt disease and by a deeper knowledge of genetic mechanisms underlying soybean-f. oxysporum interactions.

the availability of reference genome sequences and gene annotations for g. max and f. oxysporum has enabled us to study the molecular interactions between the host plant and its pathogen. emerging massively parallel sequencing techniques allow the rapid acquisition of huge amounts of genomic or transcriptomic sequence data at relatively low costs  <cit> . to date, microarray techniques have been predominantly used for gene expression analysis particularly for well-studied model organisms for which typically high-quality gene annotation data were available. compared with microarrays, rna-seq is known to have a wider dynamic range, higher technical reproducibility, and provide a better estimate of absolute expression levels  <cit> . genome-wide expression profiling of plants infected with f. oxysporum has been reported in several crop plant species, including melon  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , and banana  <cit> . however, little is known about transcriptional changes in soybean roots that have been infected by f. oxysporum and almost no attention has been paid to the study of differences in plant responses based on the pathogenicity of the infecting isolates. most likely this is because of the scarce availability of isolates able to infect the same host while displaying a range of pathogenicity. this situation draws considerable interest in comparing root transcriptional responses between non-pathogenic and pathogenic f. oxysporum isolates.

to elucidate the comprehensive gene expression profiles for both g. max and f. oxysporum, we analysed the transcriptomes of plants and non-pathogenic and pathogenic fungi at  <dig> and 96 h post inoculation . our aim was to characterize soybean genes that are differentially regulated by the host during infection by each pathogen, in order to identify new potential resistance mechanisms and candidate genes that have not previously been shown to play a role in defense. at the same time, we tried to strengthen our knowledge concerning novel details of infection by using two different pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates of f. oxysporum. the results showed markedly different gene expression profiles in different host-pathogen combinations. a peak of hdegs was observed at  <dig> hpi in soybean roots in response to both isolates and the number of hdegs was about eight times higher for the pathogenic isolate compared to the non-pathogenic one. furthermore, not only the number of genes, but also the magnitude of induction was much greater in response to the pathogenic isolate. these findings generated useful resources for the soybean research community and provided more insights into the understanding of soybean-f. oxysporum interactions.

RESULTS
quantification of fungal growth and disease severity evaluation in soybean roots
to determine the appropriate time points for the investigation of soybean transcriptome profiles following the fo <dig>  and fo <dig>  f. oxysporum isolates inoculation, quantification of the fungal translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha  gene by quantitative pcr  was carried out in this study. infection progression was monitored in inoculated roots of partially resistant soybean genotype forrest over a time course of seven days. the tef1α gene was detected in samples collected 48 h post inoculation  through  <dig> hpi with both isolates. two-factor analysis of variance  revealed significant  differences between the times of sampling  in the observed means for the fungal tef1α dna quantity and between the two treatments , and their interactions .

the highest quantity of fungal dna was measured at seven days, and five times more fungal dna  was detected for the interaction with the pathogenic isolate  vs. the non-pathogenic isolate  . this profile was indicative of an enhanced reaction of compatibility between the host and the pathogenic isolate, compared to the non-pathogenic one, at the later stages of inoculation and it suggests that the plant may already react to the invading pathogens in the first 96 h. therefore,  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were selected as the crucial time points for rna-seq analysis, because they were intended to take into account not only the plant defense responses at the early-intermediate stages of infection, but also to allow the detection of pathogen transcripts when infection was established.fig.  <dig> amount of f. oxysporum constitutive gene translation elongation factor  <dig> alpha in roots of resistant forrest soybean genotype inoculated with isolates fo <dig>  and fo <dig>  of f. oxysporum, over a time course of 168 h. dna quantities reported as ng of fungal dna per mg of plant fresh tissue used for dna extraction. values represent the mean of three pools of roots for each time-point, where each pool derived from the mixing of five different roots. same letters over the histograms state not significant differences between means of non-pathogenic  and pathogenic  inoculated samples, as resulting from tukey’s hsd test . *indicate significant differences between non-pathogenic and pathogenic inoculated means within the same time of sampling, according to two-way anova 



furthermore, disease severity index  was evaluated in seedlings at seven days after inoculation. both isolates were able to infect and colonize soybean seedlings, although to different degrees .

as expected, minor symptoms occurred in plants inoculated with isolate fo <dig>  as also stated by qpcr . the fo <dig> isolate produced fewer macroconidia in culture compared to the pathogenic one, which may have contributed to the relatively lower levels of disease and fungal dna in seedlings over a time course of seven days.

rna-seq analysis of host transcriptome
root samples were taken from plants, either noninoculated or inoculated with non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates of f. oxysporum, at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. to investigate the comprehensive gene expression profiles of g. max and its pathogen f. oxysporum simultaneously at the early stages of infection, we analysed transcriptomes obtained from sequencing rna from eighteen samples, which included three biological replicates for each condition  and times of inoculation . a total of about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> million 100 bp paired-end reads were generated from noninoculated, fo <dig> and fo40-inoculated samples, respectively, constituting approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> gb of cdna sequencing data . on average,  <dig>  % of the total reads mapped uniquely to the soybean williams  <dig> reference genome . a smaller number of uniquely aligned reads mapped to the f. oxysporum reference genome , and  <dig>  aligned reads were from the pathogenic isolate at  <dig> hpi . the fungal mapping results were consistent with the fungal dna quantities assessed by qpcr, where fungal dna increased throughout the course of infection, in particular for the pathogenic isolate, confirming the larger amount of reads detected for this isolate in the later inoculation stage .

unfortunately, given the very low read counts of f. oxysporum, in particular for the non-pathogenic isolate, further downstream analyses were only performed for soybean and not for f. oxysporum. the abundance of soybean transcripts are expressed in upper quartile normalized counts as calculated by htseq-count and quasiseq programs  <cit> . one of the three biological replicates for the fo <dig> inoculated sample at  <dig> hpi was excluded for further expression level analysis due to a relatively small number of reads. we detected in total  <dig>  soybean known protein coding expressed genes .

soybean expression profiles of fo <dig> and fo <dig> f. oxysporum isolates inoculated roots were compared with their respective noninoculated controls at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. genes were considered significantly differentially expressed  if the qvalue cut-off was below  <dig>  and highly differentially expressed  if the absolute fold change  was ≥  <dig>   <cit> .

rna-seq analysis identified  <dig>  degs. significant enrichment testing was performed for go categories and mercator bins. a fisher’s exact test was used to determine go term enrichment  on degs with a qvalue less than  <dig> . soybean version  <dig> gene models were further annotated into mercator functional categories that are easily visualized as mapman bins and a wilcox rank sum test inside mapman identified several significantly enriched bins . due to the high number of degs an additional filter of a fc greater than  <dig>  was applied for downstream analysis and visualization. this filter resulted in  <dig>  soybean hdegs . these hdegs were annotated using blast2go software  <cit>  to classified in  <dig> broader functional categories not provided in the go terms downloaded from soybase.org.fig.  <dig> venn diagram of soybean highly differentially expressed genes  at two inoculations stages  with f. oxysporum fo <dig> and fo <dig> isolates, respectively, in the resistant soybean genotype forrest. blue coloured down arrow indicates down-regulation of genes and red coloured up arrow indicates up-regulation



identification and functional categorization of f. oxysporum-responsive genes
a numerical overview of the differences in highly differentially expressed soybean genes at each time point and in each interaction is provided in fig.  <dig>  we identified  <dig> and  <dig> hdegs in response to the non-pathogenic isolate, and  <dig>  and  <dig> hdegs in response to the pathogenic isolate at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. a higher number of hdegs was observed at  <dig> hpi compared to  <dig> hpi and this number was always higher in response to the pathogenic isolate at both times of inoculations. some overlap in the hdegs identified between the isolates was observed at  <dig> hpi, where more than 50 % of hdegs detected in response to the non-pathogenic isolate was in common with the pathogenic one; however larger changes in expression levels were specifically identified in the interaction with the pathogenic isolate . more limited transcriptional changes were found at  <dig> hpi, although the host responses against the pathogenic isolate continued to be numerically higher.

in order to understand the biological processes associated with host reactions to f. oxysporum infection, soybean hdegs were assigned to different functional categories . after discarding genes with unassigned function, in both interactions the largest proportion of hdegs belonged to metabolic process and defense-related functional classes, such as resistance, response to stress, cell wall and secondary metabolism. in the interaction with the non-pathogenic isolate, metabolic process and defense-related functions accounted for  <dig>  and 37 % of the modulated genes at  <dig> hpi, falling to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % at  <dig> hpi, respectively . an opposite trend was observed in response to the pathogenic isolate and the two functional classes accounted for about 19–21 % at  <dig> hpi, increasing to 31–32 % in the later stage of inoculation . moreover, while at  <dig> hpi a similar percentage of up and down-regulated genes within each category was modulated in either of the interactions , at  <dig> hpi the majority of hdegs was down-regulated in response to the non-pathogenic isolate, and up-regulated in response to the pathogenic one . these results suggest markedly different molecular events occurred in response to the two isolates. even though soybean also activated a certain number of metabolic and defense events against the non-pathogenic isolate in the earlier phases of root colonization, the small number of modulated genes identified at  <dig> hpi, 72 % of which down-regulated, confirms the lower efficiency in infection and spread of the non-pathogenic isolate.fig.  <dig> functional categories of highly differentially expressed genes  in forrest genotype after f. oxysporum fo <dig> and fo <dig> isolate inoculation at  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours post inoculation . hdegs were annotated by blast2go analysis and classified in functional categories on the basis of literature evaluation. induced genes are represented in black, while repressed ones are in white. the total percentage of modulated transcripts within each functional category is also shown. the complete list of genes is available in additional file 6: table s6



figure  <dig> reports the proportion of genes whose induction/repression in response to inoculation was observed in both interactions or was restricted to one or the other at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. the data show clearly that most of the transcriptional modulation observed in response to the pathogenic isolate had no parallel for the non-pathogenic one, confirming that many of the changes in all functional categories were restricted to fo <dig> isolate. in contrast, most of the transcriptional modulation observed in response to fo <dig> also occurred in response to fo <dig> .fig.  <dig> specificity of transcriptional changes within each functional category in inoculated partially resistant soybean genotype forrest. proportion of genes specifically modulated in response to non-pathogenic f. oxysporum isolate fo <dig>  and pathogenic isolate fo <dig>  or common in response to both isolates  at  <dig> and 96 h post inoculation 



by visualizing the specific transcriptional changes related to biotic stress processes at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi as annotated by mapman software  <cit> , as expected, different patterns were observed in response to the non-pathogenic and pathogenic isolates . hde soybean genes were well represented for all pathways in response to fo <dig> isolate, but not for the response to fo <dig> . the major differences in host response to infection by the two fungi were in genes with hormone signalling-associated activities, peroxidases, glutathione-s-transferases and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which were totally underrepresented after fo <dig> inoculation . these observations strongly suggest that the limited number of genes specifically modulated in response to the non-pathogenic isolate were not particularly informative and on the whole it appeared that soybean mounted a much less specific response to fo <dig> inoculation, which may be considered as an unsuccessful attempt to colonize the root tissue.fig.  <dig> distribution of specific highly differentially expressed soybean genes in response to non-pathogenic f. oxysporum isolate fo <dig>  and pathogenic isolate fo <dig> , related to biotic stress processes, visualized by mapman. each square represents the normalized count value for a single gene in soybean inoculated roots at  <dig> and 96 h post inoculation 



consistent with these findings, we focused on soybean hdegs mainly induced in response to the non-pathogenic isolate or to the pathogenic one, considering the following filters: number of normalized counts  ≤ <dig> and  <dig>  in the control sample and nc ≥ <dig> in the inoculated sample. a higher number of hdegs was detected in response to the pathogenic isolate at both sampling times , as well as higher expression values . these expression values ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  nc for the non-pathogenic isolate, and from  <dig> to  <dig>  nc for the pathogenic one, at  <dig> hpi. at  <dig> hpi, only five genes were induced in response to fo <dig> isolate, with the highest expression value of  <dig>  nc, while no genes were found in response to the non-pathogenic isolate. overall, these data show that hdegs belonging to all functional classes, in particular for the metabolic process and defense-related categories, were mainly overexpressed in the interaction with fo <dig> isolate, confirming a greater stimulation of soybean defense responses to the pathogenic inoculation.

an example of the expression patterns for hdegs associated with defense mechanisms against invading pathogens is depicted by a heatmap in fig.  <dig>  we identified fifty-six genes annotated as defense-related genes, including pathogenensis-related  and thaumatin-like proteins, germins, trypsin and protease inhibitor proteins, and numerous genes related to fungal cell-wall degradation . in general, the expression of these genes increased significantly at  <dig> hpi in response to both isolates, but in particular in response to the pathogenic isolate. later in infection, some of these genes continued to be expressed after fo <dig> inoculation, while the expression of most of genes returned to control levels  for the non-pathogenic interaction. the profiles of these defense-related genes are in line with the general finding that differential gene expression was mainly specific and more pronounced towards the pathogenic isolate.fig.  <dig> clustering and heatmap of soybean highly differentially expressed genes  in the defense-related gene class. description of each gene as obtained from blast2go annotation are shown. light and dark red indicate lower and higher expression values, respectively. white indicates genes that are not de. expression heatmaps were plotted using normalized read counts. a: control; b: inoculated with non-pathogenic f. oxysporum isolate fo36; c: inoculated with pathogenic f. oxysporum isolate fo40



validation of representative genes by real-time rt-pcr
to validate the rna-seq expression profiles of soybean hdegs, the expression levels of several known responsive genes were measured by real-time rt-pcr using gene-specific primers . eighteen soybean modulated genes were chosen among those expressed in planta, with a preference for defense-related genes, and some of them are marked with a star symbol in the additional file 8: table s <dig>  which lists the selected set of f. oxysporum-responsive genes. the rt-pcr expression profiles of seventeen soybean genes agreed strongly with the rna-seq data, whereas the myb <dig> gene appeared to be slightly up-regulated according to rt-pcr analysis and slightly reduced from rna-seq results at  <dig> hpi in response to fo <dig> isolate .

overall, the enhancement in the expression levels and defense response revealed by rna-seq results in response to the pathogenic isolate were largely concordant with rt-pcr, confirming the reliability of the results.

discussion
in order to increase the understanding of transcriptomic responses produced by infection with one of the most important soybean pathogens, f. oxysporum, we performed rna-seq analysis to compare the global gene expression patterns in soybean roots inoculated with pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. the rna-seq method is particularly robust for gene expression studies and allows the identification of plant-targeted control strategies, as well as the detection of pathogenicity and virulence factors.

the timing of recognition for f. oxysporum infection on soybean is currently unknown, which makes it difficult to propose suitable time points for molecular analysis. we therefore began this investigation by characterizing the infection process in soybean roots inoculated with fo <dig> and fo <dig> isolates, in order to determine the optimal sampling times after inoculation. quantification of fungal growth and disease severity evaluation reported more fungal dna and elevated symptoms at  <dig> hpi, and as expected, in particular in response to the pathogenic isolate. as a consequence, this time-point was excluded from the further rna-seq analysis, because considered as a too late sample timing. therefore,  <dig> and  <dig> hpi were selected to investigate early-intermediate transcriptional changes, in order to elucidate host genetic responses.

our study provides the first large-scale investigation of gene expression changes that occur when soybean is inoculated with f. oxysporum, and is the first to compare pathogenic and non-pathogenic interactions in the same genetic background, using the partially resistant forrest genotype. we have identified  <dig> soybean genes that are highly differentially expressed in pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates versus control that encode for enzymes that are well known to be involved in defense-related networks. of these genes,  <dig> were found to be significantly enriched in go categories as determined by a fisher’s exact or in mapman bin categories by a wilcox rank sum test . although the remaining  <dig> genes were not enriched into one of the defined categories or bins, their known relevance in the defense response literature warrants their further investigation. we placed these genes into four broad categories: signalling-related, defense response, transcriptional regulation, and modulation of secondary and sugar metabolism-related and explored their expression below.

expression of signalling-related genes
plants are able to recognize potential microbial pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns  by host sensors, known as pattern-recognition receptors  that initiate a series of defense responses called pamp-triggered immunity . most of these plant receptors belong to family of receptor-like kinases   <cit> . in our study five leucine-rich repeat  type-rlk were identified at  <dig> hpi in response to the fo <dig> isolate, four of them up-regulated. additionally, several lrr-serine threonine protein kinase  were specifically induced after pathogenic isolate inoculation at the same time point, except one lrr-stpk  found down-regulated with both pathogens, and a second one  specifically induced in response to the non-pathogenic isolate.

brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  <dig>  is another significant prr in plants, required for pti triggered by bacterial flagellin and elongation factor tu. flagellin-sensitive  <dig>  and bak <dig> form a complex to initiate innate immunity in plant  <cit> . our results revealed the presence of two bak <dig> and one fls <dig> genes induced only after pathogenic isolate attack in the early stage of inoculation. as previously reported in a different pathosystem  <cit> , bak <dig> played a role in the resistance response of banana roots against to f. oxysporum f. sp. cubense. our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bak <dig> also controls plant programmed cell death and immunity to necrotrophic fungi, and bak <dig> mutants of arabidopsis showed extreme susceptibility to necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . these results suggest that different surveillance systems exist in response to the pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates, and only in fo40-inoculated soybean roots the increasing bak <dig> and fls <dig> levels might potentiate the innate immune response.

pathogen recognition triggers the activation of downstream signalling networks mediated by protein kinases, in particular mitogen-activated protein kinases  . several mapk and mapk kinases  genes have been characterized in the response of plants to fungal infection  <cit> . consistent with this widely accepted model, we found three mapkk kinases and two snf1-related protein kinases specifically induced in response to the pathogenic isolate at  <dig> hpi.

changes in defense response genes
one of the features of plant defense response is production of pr proteins that have been widely characterized and classified into the pr1- <dig> families  <cit> . in our research, a high number of genes representing most of  <dig> different pr were clearly identified as induced after inoculation mainly in the early time point often shared by both isolates, such as three pr <dig>  one pr <dig>  one pr <dig> and four chitinases . other pr genes up-regulated only in response to the fo <dig> isolate at  <dig> hpi included: thaumatin-like proteins , endoglucanases  and lignin forming peroxidase . furthermore, the same three pr <dig> proteins and three out of four chitinases induced by both pathogens at  <dig> hpi, were also specifically up-regulated at  <dig> hpi in response to the pathogenic isolate but not by fo <dig>  the same trend was also observed for two germin proteins , which are known to function in ros production and biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . two additional fo40-induced genes encoding bon1-associated proteins  were up-regulated at  <dig> hpi in fo40-inoculated roots. bap <dig> and bap <dig> are homologous proteins containing a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding c <dig> domain and both function in the defense pathway  <cit> . furthermore, several nodulin proteins were strongly induced by fo <dig> at  <dig> hpi. interestingly, one of them continued to be induced at  <dig> hpi for the pathogenic isolate , whereas three of them were down-regulated after non-pathogenic inoculation, suggesting a potential role in plant defense  <cit> .

in our analysis another prominent class of defense-related genes was represented by protease inhibitors. in total, we identified eighteen genes up-regulated by f. oxysporum inoculation, encoding various types of protease inhibitors. remarkably,  <dig> and seven out of them were strongly induced  only in response to the pathogenic isolate at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, respectively. indeed, fewer protease inhibitors genes, six and two, were induced by both isolates at the early and later stages of inoculation, respectively. this observation is in line with previous reports on the important role of protease inhibitors in the defense against pathogens  <cit> .

overall, the induction and greater accumulation of pr, cell wall-degrading enzymes and proteinase inhibitor genes suggested that the degradation of cell wall components of pathogens and proteolysis inhibition are important defense reactions in soybean against f. oxysporum isolates at the early infection stage . it could be speculated that the defense responses initiated at the early stage of fungal pathogen infection continued to play a role at the later stage following infection by isolate fo <dig>  while these responses dropped off after  <dig> hpi for the non-pathogenic isolate.

genes involved in transcriptional regulation
transcriptome profiling analysis identified a large number of genes encoding tfs, such as ethylene-responsive transcription factors , myb, bhlh, gata, platz and wrky, and found that their expression was significantly changed upon fo <dig> inoculation. the erf tfs play crucial roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses  <cit>  and their overexpression in transgenic plants can confer enhanced disease resistance against different types of pathogens  <cit> . the erf tfs are known to be involved in ethylene signalling  <cit> , and in agreement with this we also found that the pathogenic isolate infection up-regulated five genes for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  oxidases at  <dig> hpi. these enzymes participate in the last step of biosynthesis of ethylene, which has been associated with both wilting and resistance against vascular diseases  <cit> . the induction of acc oxidases only by the pathogenic isolate, suggests that ethylene might be involved in resistance against fo <dig> isolate.

other strongly represented tf families were nam-ataf1/2-cuc <dig>  tfs. arabidopsis nac may play a dual role in regulating both jasmonic acid - and abscisic acid -dependent responses and manipulate plant stress responses by activating other genes encoding myb tfs, amylase, cold responsive protein, dehydration responsive proteins, glutathione-s-transferases, and late embryogenesis abundant  proteins  <cit> . we observed that the percentage of up-regulated nac and myb tfs was between 60–70 % of total at  <dig> hpi for the pathogenic isolate, while no nac and one down-regulated myb gene were observed in response to fo <dig> isolate. accordingly, two lea genes were specifically induced by the pathogenic isolate at  <dig> hpi. arabidopsis r2r3-myb tf directly acts on the promoters of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes and in the signalling chain that causes flavonol-specific gene activation in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis  <cit> . in line with this, we also observed differential expression of genes encoding enzymes related to biosynthesis of flavonol and phenylpropanoid.

modulation of secondary and sugar metabolism-related genes
as previously stated, our results demonstrated the transcriptional induction of multiple genes involved not only in the phenylpropanoid pathway itself, but also in the downstream flavonoid and diterpenoid biosynthesis pathways. more specifically, phenylpropanoid-related genes, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase , 4-coumarate ligase , trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase  and caffeoyl-o-methyltransferase  were consistently modulated upon pathogenic isolate inoculation mainly at the early time point. rna-seq data also revealed significant changes in genes belonging to the flavonoid pathway upon inoculation, especially with the fo <dig> isolate, such as chalcone isomerase , flavonoid 3-hydroxylase  and flavonol synthase , as well as two terpene synthases  that were identified. this finding once again indicated that lignification and cell wall strengthening are active resistance mechanisms in the soybean-pathogen interaction, as already observed in other pathosystems , as well as flavonoids and isoflavonoids, which could be crucial metabolites for the soybean infection response  <cit> .

activation of defense responses upon pathogen infection is usually accompanied by a rapid induction of sink metabolism, possibly to satisfy the increased demand for carbohydrates as an energy source to sustain the cascade of cost-intensive direct defense responses and further mediate physiological adaptations  <cit> . additionally, pathogens try to manipulate plant carbohydrate metabolism for their own needs  <cit> . in our study, we identified eight up-regulated genes belonging to the carbohydrate metabolic process group, seven out of them specifically induced after pathogenic inoculation at  <dig> hpi, and one cell wall invertase   induced by the same isolate at both time points. enhanced expression and activity of cwis has been reported in several plant-pathogen interactions and is essential to modulate sugar partitioning necessary for the pathogen development  <cit> . moreover, during infection cwi activity also triggers plant defense responses, such as induction of pr genes, pal gene expression, callose deposition and reduction of cell death, in agreement with our previous finding. one of the other possibilities for changing the sugar content is the regulation of the expression of the sugar transporters. we observed the up-regulation of five bidirectional sugar transporters only in response to the fo <dig> isolate at  <dig> hpi. in rice infected by xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, sweet proteins were up-regulated and sucrose accumulated in apoplast ready to be used for the pathogen growth  <cit> . santi and co-workers  <cit>  reported that sucrose transporter genes are first down-regulated during infection of grapevine by stolbur phytoplasma to limit the spread and then up-regulated during the recovery stage providing necessary nutrients  <cit> . together, these results substantiate the active mobilization of sucrose in fo40-inoculated soybean roots, providing ready-to-use sugars for pathogen growth and plant immunity.

CONCLUSIONS
using rna-seq, we analysed the expression profiles of soybean roots inoculated with non-pathogenic/pathogenic fungal isolates at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. we identified markedly differential responsive expression patterns in the two host-pathogen combinations and more active and drastic reactions were observed in response to the pathogenic isolate. this response included a stronger activation of many well-known defense-related genes, and several genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis and signalling, tfs, secondary and sugar metabolism. the high degree of activation of host defense signalling pathways identified in soybean was consistent with the more extensive necrosis and the highest quantity of fungal dna observed for the pathogenic isolate. these results may be useful to understand the molecular basis of soybean-f. oxysporum interactions, and also in the development of new resistance mechanisms in soybean against f. oxysporum, including the over-expression of key soybean genes.
