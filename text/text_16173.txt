BACKGROUND
hiv enters the central nervous system  by crossing the blood brain barrier  during early stages of hiv infection through infected blood cells  <cit> . hiv infected cells secrete the tat protein extracellularly  <cit>  and affect the functions of human brain microvascular endothelial cells   <cit> . the hbmvecs form a selective barrier between peripheral circulation and the cns. the barrier properties of hbmvecs are principally imparted by adherens junction proteins  and tight junction proteins   <cit> . ve-cadherin and catenin play major role in stabilization of adherens junctions  and barrier integrity  <cit> . cadherin complex is composed of vascular endothelial-cadherin , bound to β-catenin or plakoglobin, which in turn binds to α-catenin; vinculin, α-actinin, zo- <dig> and actin  <cit> . the tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin complex is critical for the integrity of the ajs and endothelial permeability  <cit> .

ve-ptp is a tyrosine phosphatase, transmembrane binding partner of ve-cadherin. it connects with ve-cadherin through an extracellular domain and maintains the unphosphorylated state of ve-cadherin  <cit> . another phosphatase; shp <dig> is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor ptp, consisting of two n-terminal tandem sh <dig> domains and a catalytic phosphatase  domain and a c-terminal tail with two tyrosine residues  <cit> . ukropec et al.  <cit> ; reported shp <dig> as a component of ve-cadherin complex, which regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of both, β-catenin  <cit>  and ve-cadherin  <cit> .

phosphorylated states of the ve-cadherin and β-catenin regulate their interactions, and control the adhesion forces  <cit> . ve-cadherin has many putative phospho-tyrosine sites, but y <dig>  y <dig>  and y <dig> phosphorylation are reported to be important for maintaining the barrier integrity  <cit> . pyk <dig> is a redox-sensitive tyrosine kinase and gets activated by nadph mediated ros generation  <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin is induced by pyk <dig>   <cit>  and dephosphorylated by shp <dig>  <cit> .

pro-inflammatory factors affect the phosphorylated state of ve-cadherin complex and disrupt the barrier integrity  <cit> . in this study, we have selected hiv- <dig> tat c to study the effect on endothelial permeability, because hiv- <dig> clade c alone is responsible for more than 56% of global hiv infections. hiv- <dig> clade c infections are prevalent in south-east asian countries including india  <cit> . we have examined the effects of the hiv- <dig> tat c protein on redox-sensitive kinase pyk <dig> and tyrosine phosphatases of ve-cadherin complex  and their impact on tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin, β-catenin and permeability of hbmvecs.

hbmvecs were grown as confluent monolayer and exposed with hiv- <dig> tat c protein at various doses  in serum-free m <dig> media. control cells were treated with tat buffer . bmvecs have been exposed to tat c at different concentration ranges due to its closeness to reported serum levels and hbmvecs would normally encounter such concentrations of tat in neuroaids patients  <cit> . hbmvecs were harvested for rna and protein sample preparation after 12 hours of hiv- <dig> tat c protein treatments.

western blot analysis
cell lysis were done in ripa buffer . estimation of protein concentrations was done by bradford assay . proteins samples were boiled in sds-loading buffer and run on 12% sds-gel, transferred on pvdf membrane  at 100 v for 2 hrs. primary antibody incubations were given overnight at 4°c with dilutions . hrp conjugated secondary antibody were applied for 1 hour at room temperature and developed by using super signal developing reagent . antibodies against p-y-731-ve-cadherin , ve-cadherin, anti-β-tubulin, nox <dig> and nox <dig> , β-catenin , pyk <dig> , shp <dig>  have been used in the study. ve-ptp antibody was provided as a kind gift by astrid f. nottebaum, max planck institute of molecular medicine, muenster, germany.

transendothelial electrical resistance  assay
evom <dig>  was used to measure electrical resistance across the endothelial monolayer. ptfe membrane inserts   consisting of  <dig>  μm pore sizes were used in the permeability assays.  <dig> % bovine gelatin coating was done on insert membrane before cell seeding for better adherence of hbmvecs. cell seeding density was 2 ×  <dig> in 500 μl of complete m <dig> media. to check the development of junctional integrity, teer values were checked on regular intervals until reached at consistent resistance in endothelial cells. after attaining the optimal confluency, the hbmvecs were treated with different doses of hiv- <dig> tat c protein. teer of hbmvecs was measured after 12 hrs of hiv- <dig> tat c protein exposure. the resistance of empty insert membranes, without cell seeding was deducted from recorded teer values.

fluorescein migration assay
the fluorescein migration assay was performed as described previously elsewhere  <cit> . hbmvecs were seeded on membrane inserts in similar way as for teer assay. after treatment with different doses of tat c proteins, cells were washed with hbss buffer and incubated with  <dig> % sodium fluorescein dye  on upper chamber of the insert membrane. hbmvecs were incubated with sodium fluorescein dye for 30 minutes at 37°c, followed by collection of 100 μl of the flowthrough from lower chambers. fluorescence was measured at 480/530 nm wavelength by using fluorimeter .

co-immunoprecipitation of ve-cadherin/ve-ptp/β-catenin and shp2

RESULTS
hiv- <dig> tat mediated phosphorylation of adherens junction protein 
we investigated the tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin in hbmvecs treated with increasing doses from 100 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml of hiv- <dig> tat c. both the adherens junction proteins   were significantly phosphorylated up to  <dig> folds at their respective tyrosine positions in dose dependent manner . we checked the tyrosine phosphorylation  of ve-cadherin in hbmvecs exposed to heat inactivated tat c and couldn’t find any substantial alteration in ve-cadherin phosphorylation .

downregulation and dissociation of ve-ptp and shp <dig> from ve-cadherin complex in hiv- <dig> tat treated human bmvecs
ve-ptps are essentially associated with ve-cadherin and perform the function of keeping ve-cadherin in dephosphorylated state in quiescent cells  <cit> . we observed a dose dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin  in hiv- <dig> tat c exposed hbmvecs . we further investigated the levels of ve-ptp and their association with ve-cadherin in hiv- <dig> tat exposed hbmvecs. we observed decreased expression of total ve-ptp , along with the significant dissociation  of ve-ptp from ve-cadherin complex in hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs . shp <dig>  a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase co-precipitates with ve-cadherin complex in basal state of cells  <cit> . shp <dig> phosphatase maintains the integrity of ve-cadherin complex, by dephosphorylating ve-cadherin-associated β-catenin as well as ve-cadherin  <cit> . shp <dig> expression levels decreased significantly  along with increasing dose of hiv- <dig> tat . the pull down experiment with unit amount of ve-cadherin complex by using monoclonal ve-cadherin antibody has shown significant reduction  in shp <dig> association with ve-cadherin complex . we observed that both the tyrosine phosphatases regulating the tyrosine phosphorylation, get dissociated from the ve-cadherin complex in hiv- <dig> tat c exposed hbmvecs.

hiv- <dig> tat dissociates β-catenin from the ve-cadherin/β-catenin complex and induces endothelial permeability
hiv- <dig> tat induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin occurs in dose dependent manner . shp <dig> and ve-ptp expression also got downregulated and dissociated from ve-cadherin complex after hiv- <dig> tat treatment  in hbmvecs, leaving ve-cadherin complex prone to the phopshorylation . co-immunoprecipitation of the cadherin complex by monoclonal antibody of ve-cadherin showed 60% reduction  in the association of β-catenin with ve-cadherin in hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs . endothelial cell permeability, assessed by teer and sodium fluorescein migration assay showed an elevated permeability in hiv- <dig> tat, treated hbmvecs . compared to control cells, hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs, has shown 40–50% decrease in teer values, however sodium fluorescein migration assay has shown about 60–70% increase in endothelial cell permeability in trans-well membrane experiments .

hiv- <dig> tat upregulates nadph oxidase  expression and increases ros production in human bmvecs
nadph oxidases regulate ros production; which can affect the ptk  and ptp  balance in cells  <cit> . intracellular ros level can regulate pyk <dig> activation and might play role in ve-ptp dissociation from cadherin complex  <cit> . we checked the expression level of nox <dig> and nox <dig> and overall intracellular ros production by dcfda staining. we observed the significant  induction in the expression levels of nox <dig> and nox <dig> in hiv- <dig> tat c exposed hbmvecs  and increase in the ros production in dose dependent manner .

hiv- <dig> tat activates pyk- <dig> in dose dependent manner
proline-rich tyrosine kinase  <dig>  is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, belongs to the focal adhesion kinase  family  <cit> . hiv- <dig> tat c exposed hbmvecs showed a dose dependent increase in expression level of nox <dig> and nox <dig> and levels of intracellular ros. we tested the level of phospho-pyk <dig> in hiv- <dig> tat c treated hbmvecs to delineate the role of pyk <dig> activation after tat c treatment and to further find the role of pyk <dig> activation in tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and ve-cadherin. a significant increase in the levels of phospho-pyk <dig>  was observed in hbmvecs  with increasing dose of hiv- <dig> tat c protein . application of 100nm dpi; as ros scavenger resulted into decreased pyk <dig> activation/phosphorylation . ros scavenging helped in combating the effect of hiv- <dig> tat c on pyk <dig> activation .

ros scavenger  mediated rescue of shp <dig> expression and downregulation in phosphorylation of β-catenin
redox-sensitive pyk <dig> activation and phosphorylation of β-catenin leads to conformational disorganization of cadherin complex in endothelial cells  <cit> . we exposed hbmvecs with ros scavenger dpi and studied the effect of blocking ros generation on pyk <dig> activation, shp <dig> expression, phosphorylation of β-catenin, and endothelial permeability. we observed a sustained expression level of shp <dig> in dpi treated hbmvecs . interestingly, dpi treatment helped in rescuing of shp <dig> expression even in tat treated hbmvecs , which suggested the potential of blocking the ros on kinase/phosphatase balance in hbmvecs. we checked the tyrosine phosphorylated state of the β-catenin in dpi treated hbmvecs. dpi treatment alone showed inhibition of the phosphorylation of β-catenin  compared to highly phosphorylated state  of β-catenin in hiv- <dig> tat exposed hbmvecs. dpi treatment followed by tat treatment resulted into decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. tat induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin mediated by ros; resulted into imbalance of kinases/phosphatases. the ros scavenging helped in ameliorating the effect of hiv- <dig> tat protein on perturbed phosphorylation of β-catenin. we observed that ros inhibition by dpi treatment has significantly helped in mitigating the effect of hiv- <dig> tat c protein on permeability of hbmvecs  .

pyk <dig> inhibiter abrogates the phosphorylation of β-catenin and rescues endothelial permeability
hbmvecs were treated with pyk <dig> inhibiter pf- <dig>   and checked for tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. significant reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin resulted into an accumulation of total β-catenin . no significant effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was observed in hbmvecs treated with pyk <dig> inhibiter , followed by hiv- <dig> tat treatment. the level of total β-catenin was comparable to pf- <dig> treated hbmvecs . the effect of pf- <dig> was also investigated on the permeability of hbmvecs. the inhibition of pyk <dig> significantly abrogated the effect of hiv- <dig> tat and maintained the endothelial permeability  .

discussion
neurological consequences still persist in the era of haart therapy, where viral load has been effectively controlled in infected patients. however hiv- <dig> protein such as tat has been detected in the csf of patients kept on anti-retroviral therapy and show effectively controlled viremia  <cit> . therefore, we have focused on the bystander effect of hiv- <dig> tat protein on human brain microvascular endothelial cells. in brain microvascular endothelial cells, the levels of ve-cadherin regulate the permeability of endothelial cells  <cit> . vascular endothelial cells are connected by homophilic adhesion through ajps and tjps  <cit> . we previously reported the post-transcriptional regulation of ve-cadherin by mir- <dig> and permeability in hbmvecs exposed to hiv- <dig> tat c protein  <cit> . increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and associated catenins are known to compromises the junctional architecture of endothelial cells, which disrupts their physical interactions at cell-cell junctions  <cit> . inflammatory conditions change the magnitude of tyrosine phosphorylation of ajps  <cit> . previously, phosphorylation of y <dig> amino acid position in ve-cadherin has been reported to be responsible for impairing the association of ve-cadherin with p120-catenin and β-catenin  <cit>  during leukocyte extravasation  <cit> .

different mechanisms and pathways have been reported for the regulation of endothelial permeability. involvement of ppar/lipid raft-dependent mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> activation lead to the degradation of occludin and tricellulin, which has been reported in c12-hsl-induced perturbations of epithelial barrier functions  <cit> . role of activation of erk1/ <dig> and akt signaling has been described for increased bbb permeability through decreased tight junction  protein expressions in brain microvascular endothelial cells. tat mediated effects can be attenuated by application of ppar antagonist  <cit> . another in vitro bbb model study showed that hiv- <dig> infection of pericytes can also result into compromised bbb integrity  <cit> . another recent study highlighted the role of rho signaling and creb in triggering the nuclear localization of zo- <dig> and perturbing the endothelial permeability after hiv- <dig> tat exposure  <cit> .

in our study, we observed a dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin at p-y <dig> position and β-catenin at p-y <dig> position . the tyr- <dig> site is considered unique to ve-cadherin in reference to endothelial permeability  <cit> . ve-cadherin and β-catenin have shown induced phosphorylation at their tyrosine positions accompanied by reduced expression of respective phosphatases ve-ptp and shp <dig>  tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin which disrupts their physical interactions explains increased endothelial permeability and leakage  <cit> .

we studied the role of kinases and phosphatases in hiv- <dig> tat induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ajps. we focused on pyk <dig> kinase because pyk <dig> is highly redox sensitive kinase and its signaling gets affected by intracellular ros levels  <cit> . pyk <dig> has been described as a critical regulator of endothelial inflammation via phosphorylating ikk-rela/p <dig> pathway, therefore facilitating the nuclear translocation of the rela/p <dig>  <cit> . in our study, increased generation of ros was observed with the increasing doses of hiv- <dig> tat c exposure . role of nox <dig> in hiv- <dig> tat induced generation of ros has been reported in human astrocytes, where enhanced monocyte adhesion was regulated by ros mediated increase in icam/vcam expression  <cit> . secretion of tnf-α has also been reported to induce nadph oxidase-derived ros generation and pyk <dig> activation in h9c <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, pyk2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported to disrupt the association of zonula occludens- <dig> with the endothelial tight junctions  <cit> . our study showed increased intracellular ros generation, followed by increase in phosphorylation and activation of pyk <dig>  in hiv- <dig> tat exposed hbmvecs . this explains the higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in β-catenin and ve-cadherin which will lead to increased endothelial cell permeability . as expected, ros scavenging has significantly reduced the activation of pyk <dig>  even in presence of hiv- <dig> tat in hbmvecs. ptps act together with cellular protein tyrosine kinases and control the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of substrate proteins and associated signaling  <cit> .

ve-ptp enhances ve-cadherin mediated cell–cell adhesion and plays a major role in maintaining endothelial barrier permeability  <cit> . the significant downregulation of ve-ptp   and significant decrease in association of ve-ptp with ve-cadherin were observed in hiv- <dig> tat c exposed hbmvecs . in a recent report, vockel et. al.  reported the generation of ros through activation of nadph oxidases and activation of redox-sensitive tyrosine kinase pyk <dig> and their effect on cell-cell junctions. they suggested that activation of pyk <dig> could be essential for ve-cadherin/ve-ptp dissociation  <cit> . in our study, the downregulation and dissociation of ve-ptp from ve-cadherin complex explains the high level of tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin in hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs. another, non-receptor cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase shp <dig> has been reported to be associated with β-catenin  <cit>  and dephosphorylates β-catenin and ve-cadherin in quiscent cells. we observed the significant downregulation of shp <dig> in hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs in dose dependent manner  and a significant dissociation of shp <dig> from ve-cadherin complex.

pro-inflammatory insults affect the binding of ve-cadherin and β-catenin  <cit> . we observed the separation of β-catenin from ve-cadherin complex in pull down experiment in hiv- <dig> tat exposed hbmvecs . the disaggregation of ve-cadherin and β-catenin is most likely due to the increased level of their tyrosine phosphorylation. the disassembly of these proteins led to the enhanced endothelial permeability in hiv- <dig> tat treated hbmvecs.ros generation activated the tyrosine kinases and elevated phosphorylation of ajps and finally disruption of endothelial integrity. we scavenged the ros by using dpi followed by hiv- <dig> tat treatment. ros scavenging significantly abolished the pyk <dig> activation , sustained shp <dig> expression level , and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin  in the hbmvecs. these changes resulted into improved permeability in dpi treated hbmvecs .

we checked the tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin in hbmvecs treated with pyk <dig> inhibiter . pf- <dig> abrogates the kinase activity of pyk2/fak family kinases. a significant decrease in p-y-β-catenin was observed in the hbmvecs treated with pf- <dig> . our data are in accordance with the previous reports; where β-catenin has been reported to act as a substrate of pyk <dig> kinase  <cit> . phosphorylation of β-catenin was also checked in the hbmvecs, treated with pf- <dig> followed by similar amount of hiv- <dig> tat protein exposure. the effect of hiv- <dig> tat on tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin was significantly reduced in hbmvecs treated with pf- <dig> as well as in ros scavenger treated hbmvecs, which suggested that the β-catenin phosphorylation can be controlled by manipulating pyk <dig> kinase activity and well as intracellular ros levels. pharmacological inhibition of pyk <dig> has been reported as a potential therapeutic strategy to combat acute lung injury in patients as well as mice model of asthma  <cit> . pyk <dig> inhibition rescued the permeability of hbmvecs exposed to hiv- <dig> tat protein . inhibition of the pyk <dig> activity by pf- <dig> had a partial effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin . this suggested that the phosphorylation events of ve-cadherin are also partially regulated through src and rac mediated kinase cascades  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hiv- <dig> tat c mediated activation of nadph oxidases  led to the increased generation of ros in hbmvecs and activation of pyk <dig> kinase. upregulation of pyk <dig> activity resulted into the increased tyrosine phosphorylated forms of β-catenin and ve-cadherin. the dissociation of ve-ptp and shp <dig> from ve-cadherin complex increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ve-cadherin/β-catenin, which led to disrupted physical association of ajps within ve-cadherin complex at endothelial junctions. these conformational alterations increased the permeability in hbmvecs. ros scavenging as well as inhibition of the pyk <dig> activity showed a significant potential in combating the hiv- <dig> tat c mediated disruption of endothelial permeability . this study suggests the involvement of post-translational modifications of ajps in the disruption of barrier integrity in hbmvecs by hiv- <dig> tat c protein. this finding will be helpful in understanding the effect of viral proteins in a bystander fashion on human brain microvascular endothelial cells.
