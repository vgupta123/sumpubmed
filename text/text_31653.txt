BACKGROUND
sarocladium oryzae  is an ascomycetes fungus causing sheath rot disease in rice. it has recently emerged as a major threat for rice production in rice growing ecosystems in the world. in addition to rice, this fungus infects other important cereal food crops such as maize, sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, and foxtail millet  <cit> . the commonly occurring weedy species in rice fields also acts as collateral hosts and source of natural inoculum in endemic areas  <cit> .

s. oryzae produces white, sparsely branched and septate mycelium. conidiophores are branched once or twice with 3– <dig> phialades in a whorl. the conidium is a aseptate, hyaline, cylindrical in shape and located on tip of phialades  <cit> . the conidium germinates and invades rice through the stomata and wounds caused by insects. later mycelium grows intercellularly within vascular and mesophyll tissues  <cit> . the pathogen infects the uppermost leaf sheath enclosing young panicle and lesion length may range from  <dig> to 5 cm and lesion may enlarge to whole flag leaf sheath in severe cases. the necrotic lesions on flag leaf retards translocation of nutrients from foliage to panicle leading to complete suppression of panicle exertion. this results in production of partially filled chaffy grains, and yield loss ranging from of  <dig> to  <dig> %  <cit> . despite the considerable loss caused by this fungus, the life cycle and infection biology has been meagerly studied. sheath rot symptom is also induced by application of cerulenin which was demonstrated by developing cerulenin negative mutants, which did not produce rot symptoms  <cit> . also virulent strains of the fungi known to secrete proteinases at significantly higher levels compared to less virulent strains indicating the possible roles of fungal proteinases in plant pathogenicity.

the genomic resources for s. oryzae in public databases  are limited to internal transcribed spacer  region sequences of ribosomal dna and our previous qtl mapping study  <cit> . due to lack of information on genes involved in pathogenicity/virulence, host–pathogen interactions and microsatellites markers, rice-sarocladium pathosystem has not been studied well at global level. considering these facts, we sequenced whole genome of highly virulent isolate of s. oryzae  from major rice growing region of south india. this is the first report of de novo genome assembly and annotation of s. oryzae. we carried out detailed analyses of gene families, secondary metabolite gene clusters, pathogenicity related genes, transposable repeat elements, phylogenetic relationship with other fungi and microsatellites. in addition, we analysed putative genes involved in helvolic acid and cerulenin biosynthesis pathways, which are very important in sarocladium disease biology. the genomic resources generated from this study can be translated into designing better disease management strategies to mitigate sheath rot disease epidemics globally and widen the understanding of rice-sarocladium pathosystem.

methods
isolation of fungus and confirmation
diseased flag leaf sheath sampled over  <dig> locations in major rice growing regions of karnataka state, india was used for isolation of fungus. diseased sheath was surface sterilized using  <dig>  % mercuric chloride solution followed by three times washing with sterile water. sterilized diseased sheath pieces were incubated at room temperature for 4– <dig> days and germinating spores were transferred to potato dextrose agar  medium. based on morphological features of conidiophores, phialades and conidiospores  <cit> , the fungus was identified as s. oryzae. the virulence test of s. oryzae was carried out by standard mycelial inoculation  <cit>  and detached tiller assay. the virulent field isolate saro- <dig> isolated from shrirangapatna , mandya district, a major rice growing region under cauvery command area was selected for whole genome sequencing. the fungus was characterized for internal transcriber region using its- <dig> and its- <dig> markers  <cit>  to confirm the fungus as s. oryzae.

dna isolation, illumina library preparation and sequencing
the virulent strain of s. oryzae  was grown on potato dextrose broth  medium for three days. the mycelium was grinded using liquid nitrogen and genomic dna was isolated using nucleo-pore gdna fungal and bacterial mini kit . the dna quality and quantity was assessed by nanodrop and qubit , respectively. the genomic dna was sheared to generate fragments of approximately 400–600 bp in covaris microtube with the e <dig> system . the fragment size distribution was checked using agilent bioanalyzer  with high sensitivity dna kit . the fragmented dna was cleaned up using highprep beads . the illumina paired-end library was prepared as per manufacturers instruction using nextflex dna sequencing kit . the paired end library was sequenced using illumina nextseq  <dig> in genotypic technologies, bengaluru and the length of read sequence was  <dig> nts from both the ends of the fragment.

preprocessing of raw sequence reads
the low quality bases with phred score less than q <dig>  and adapter sequence contamination in raw sequence reads of illumina was discarded using fastx-toolkit .

analysis of orthologous gene families in ascomycetes fungi
gene families were inferred using orthomcl   <cit>  by comparing proteins of s. oryzae with other ascomycetes fungi like magnaporthe oryzae , fusarium graminearum , acremonium chrysogenum , and fusarium oxysporum . the groups having at least one copy from each genome were considered as core orthologous groups .

phylogenetic relationship
based on orthomcl clustering,  <dig> single copy ortholog gene groups from five fungal species were selected randomly and aligned separately using muscle  <cit>  version  <dig> . <dig> with default parameters. poorly aligned regions were removed by gblocks  <cit>  and all hundred multiple sequence alignments  were concatenated. then,  <dig> bootstrap replicates were performed using seqboot program in phylip package version  <dig>   <cit> . the maximum-likelihood tree was constructed by phyml  <cit>  v <dig>   with  <dig> bootstrap replicates to infer phylogenetic relationship of s. oryzae to other ascomycetes fungi . the consensus tree was drawn using figtree v <dig> . <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis results are deposited in treebase  and dryad digital repository .

pathogenicity genes in s. oryzae
the fungal pathogenicity genes were retrieved from the pathogen-host interaction  database  <cit>   and blastp was performed against s. oryzae proteome. protein alignments with more than 40 % identity and 70 % query coverage were considered as putative pathogenicity genes in s. oryzae.

secretome analysis
signal peptides and cleavage sites of s. oryzae proteins were predicted using signalp version  <dig>   and all proteins with signal peptides were analysed for presence of transmembrane  domains using web servers like phobius  and tmhmm version  <dig>  . subsequently, mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting signal containing s. oryzae proteins were removed based on prediction by targetp  <dig>  . finally, proteins containing a potential gpi -anchor signal identified by predgpi  web server were discarded.

analysis of carbohydrate-active  enzymes in s. oryzae proteome
the s. oryzae proteins from secretome analysis were subjected for cazy annotation using cat  <cit>  and dbcan  <cit>  servers, which are based on the cazy  database classification  <cit> . the results from both were combined when the e-value less than 10− <dig> and classified as per type of reaction catalyzed like glycoside hydrolases , glycosyl transferases , polysaccharide lyases , carbohydrate esterases , carbohydrate-binding modules , and auxillary activities  as described in cazy database .

the scaffold sequences of s. oryzae were analysed for secondary metabolites gene clusters using antismash  <cit> .

cytochrome p <dig> family and transcription factors  analyses
the cytochrome p <dig> gene family classification in s. oryzae was done using fungal cytochrome p <dig> database . the proteins encoding for tfs were classified based on fungal transcription factors database .

pathway analysis of helvolic acid and cerulenin biosynthesis
we retrieved amino acid sequences of putative genes involved in helvolic acid biosynthesis from aspergillus genome database  and protein homology search was carried out with s. oryzae genes. the genes with minimum 50 % identity and 70 % query coverage were considered as putative candidates in helvolic acid biosynthesis pathway. in addition, a homology search was also performed against ncbi non-redundant protein database to obtain homologous sequences in closely related fungal species. the protein domain based search was performed to identify putative genes involved in cerulenin biosynthesis.

prediction of repeats and simple sequence repeats 
the s. oryzae scaffold sequences were subjected for de novo repeat prediction using repeatmasker  <cit> . reference based repeats analysis was done by comparing to reference repeat library database of repbase . the whole genome of s. oryzae was analyzed to determine the distribution and frequency of various types of ssrs using microsatellite identification tool   <cit>  . the minimum length of ssr motif was set as  <dig> for mono,  <dig> for di,  <dig> for tri, tetra, penta and hexa motifs.

RESULTS
genome assembly and annotation
the s. oryzae isolate, saro- <dig> was selected for whole genome sequencing based on virulence study, and was confirmed by mycelial morphology, colony characteristics and its sequencing. s. oryzae  produced sparsely branched mycelium with orange pigmentation on potato dextrose agar  medium. the conidium was single-celled, cylindrical and hyaline in structure . the ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer  region of s. oryzae isolate saro-  <dig> was sequenced using sanger sequencing platform. then, the its sequence was analysed by blastn to confirm the identity of saro- <dig>  the top  <dig> hits with e-value of  <dig> confirmed the identity of saro- <dig> isolate as s. oryzae .

saro- <dig> was isolated from major rice growing region in cauvery canal irrigated area of south karnataka, india. sequencing was carried out using illumina nextseq <dig>  a total of  <dig> , <dig>  raw reads were generated and the read length was  <dig> nts. discarding low quality reads resulted  <dig> , <dig> reads which corresponds to approximately 82x sequence depth of high quality data and these reads were assembled using spades genome assembler  <cit> . the assembly process resulted  <dig>  contigs with total consensus genome size of  <dig> ,109 bp. the maximum contig size was 89796 bp, and minimum contig size was 209 bp. the average size of the contig was 5597 bp and the n <dig> value of contigs was  <dig>  kb indicating good quality assembly for further downstream analysis . the simple gene structures of most fungi facilitate accurate gene prediction. moreover, majority of fungal species lack est data to use them in gene prediction process. as a result, gene prediction in fungi heavily based on either de novo or comparative gene prediction models  <cit> . the ab initio gene prediction using augustus  <dig> . <dig> revealed that s. oryzae genome harbors  <dig>  protein coding genes. out of which,  <dig> were annotated with uniprot fungal protein database and remaining  <dig> genes did not find significant annotation . the average length of gene was 1689 bp with  <dig> genes were spaced at every one mb of genome. this indicates that s. oryzae genome is gene dense like other fungi. an average distance between genes was  <dig>  kb with gc content of  <dig> % in the coding regions. there were  <dig>  exons comprising of  <dig>  mb of total exon length. the average length of exon was  <dig>  bp with  <dig>  exons per gene. overall,  <dig> introns were present in  <dig> genes with total length of  <dig>  mb and average length of introns was  <dig>  bp . the average exon and intron lengths and number of introns per gene in s. oryzae are in concordance with other sequenced ascomycetes fungi like neurospora and magnaporthe . the structural uniformity of genes among ascomycetes fungi may provide a unique opportunity to study their evolution.table  <dig> whole genome assembly features of s. oryzae





protein family  domains and gene ontology  annotation
an interproscan pfam analysis identified  <dig>  protein families containing  <dig> proteins in s. oryzae. large number of major facilitator superfamily , fungal specific transcription factor , protein kinase , fungal zn-cys binuclear cluster , sugar transporters , short chain dehydrogenase , cytochrome p <dig> , wd domain g-beta repeat , fad binding , methyltransferase , and pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductases  domain containing proteins were enriched in the s. oryzae genome. majority of these gene families are known to be involved in host-pathogen interactions, indicating s. oryzae emerging as a very important plant pathogen to study arsenal of pathogenicity genes.

the gene ontology  annotation of  <dig>  genes of s. oryzae revealed that  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of genes were annotated with biological, cellular and molecular functions, respectively . among biological processes, around  <dig>  % of genes were involved in transmembrane transport, followed by carbohydrate metabolism , translation , transcription , dna repair , intracellular protein transport , biosynthetic process , lipid metabolism  and protein folding . with respect to cellular process,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of genes were found to be associated with nucleus, cytosol, and cytoplasm, respectively. similarly, in molecular function around  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of genes were involved in atp binding, zinc ion binding, dna binding, and oxidoreductases activity.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  annotation of s. oryzae genes



orthology, multigene families and phylogenetic relationship of ascomycetes fungi
the orthologous genes are resultant of speciation process and clear delineation of orthologous relationship between species helps us to reconstruct evolution of species  <cit> . moreover, orthology is the most accurate way to identify differences and similarities, transfer of functional gene information from model organisms to uncharacterized newly sequenced genomes  <cit> . to predict ortholog genes and gene family duplications among five sequenced ascomycetes fungi , we clustered their proteomes using orthomcl tool. the clustering of proteomes resulted  <dig> ortholog groups , of which  <dig> were core orthologous groups  among ascomycetes fungi. among cogs,  <dig> were single copy ortholog genes indicating they are putative essential genes. there were  <dig> orthologous groups consisting of  <dig> genes found to be duplicated  in s. oryzae genome. the largest multigene family was encoding polyketide synthase dehydratase , followed by abc transporter , abc transporter transmembrane region , aldehyde dehydrogenase family , fibronectin type iii-like domain , pa <dig> domain , copper amine oxidase , wsc domain , opt oligopeptide transporter protein . the polyketide synthase dehydratase gene family is known to produce secondary metabolites and essential for fungal virulence  <cit>  to invade the host. the abc transporters also play a vital role in pathogen virulence  <cit>  by exporting noxious extracellular toxins and impose survivability to the fungus during adverse environmental conditions. the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of proteins are involved in production of indole- <dig> acetic acid  in fungi, which is very important during host-pathogen interaction  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the venn diagram illustrates shared and distinct orthologous gene families in ascomycetes fungi. the proteomes of s. oryzae, a. chrysogenum, f. graminearum, f. oxysporum, and m. oryzae were clustered using orthomcl. the number of genes in each species are shown in parenthesis



phylogenetic relationship between s. oryzae with other ascomycetes fungi was inferred based on protein similarity of hundred randomly choosen single copy ortholog genes from orthomcl analysis. based on wag model  <cit>  of protein evolution, s. oryzae was closely related to m. oryzae  followed by a. chrysogenum, f. oxysporum and f. graminearum . the closer relatedness to magnaporthe implies the shared gene arsenal required for adaptation to same host.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on hundred single copy ortholog genes. genetic relatedness of s. oryzae to other ascomycetes fungi based on single copy ortholog genes. randomly  <dig> single copy ortholog genes were aligned and  <dig> bootstrap maximum likelihood tree constructed based on wag model of evolution



pathogenicity associated genes/factors in s. oryzae
to our knowledge, pathogenicity genes/factors are not determined so far in s. oryzae genome due to lack of genomic resources. the s. oryzae infect aerial parts of the rice plant, especially uppermost leaf sheath enclosing the young panicles. to identify putative genes involved in pathogenicity, we analysed s. oryzae proteomes for pathogen-host interaction  gene database, secretary proteins, carbohydrate-active enzymes , secondary metabolites, transporters, and transcription factors that are required to colonize in the host tissue.

a. putative pathogen-host interaction  genes
the phi database has collection of experimentally verified virulence associated genes from fungi, oomycetes and bacteria  <cit> . all  <dig>  protein sequences of s. oryzae were aligned to phi fungal genes using blastp . we identified  <dig>  putative phi genes in s. oryzae spanning across  <dig> different fungal species. highest number of homologs was found in fusarium graminearum , followed by magnaporthe oryzae , aspergillus fumigatus , candida albicans , botrytis cinerea , cryptococcus neoformans , fusarium oxysporum , and other fungal species  . we assume that these genes are putative candidate pathogenicity determinants to induce pathogenicity in s. oryzae as their role in pathogenesis is already proven in their respective host species   <cit> . these preliminary results pave the way for future researchers to dissect pathogenicity genes in s. oryzae.

b. secretory proteins
the secretome analysis of s. oryzae proteome revealed  <dig> proteins harboring signal peptides  . the aspartyl protease domain  containing secretory proteins were enriched in the s. oryzae genome and are mainly involved in proteolytic activity . another class of secretory proteins like tyrosinase is known to be involved in melanin production. other important domain containing secretory proteins like hydrophobic surface binding protein a , cupin, fungal hydrophobin, and lipase were enriched in the s. oryzae genome .

c. cazymes
carbohydrate-active enzymes  play a vital role in metabolism of structural components of cell wall and storage glucans in plant pathogens. cazymes are responsible for breakdown of cell wall components of host to establish successful infection process. pathogen uses the host as a nutrient source and deploys cazymes to degrade plant storage compounds. analysis of cazymes revealed,  <dig> proteins encoding cazymes, which were distributed across  <dig> cazyme protein families. out of which,  <dig> proteins had signal peptides and remaining  <dig> proteins lacked signal peptides . further classification of cazymes based on their catalytic activity showed, highest number of proteins  encoding for glycosyl transferases  followed by glycoside hydrolases , carbohydrate esterases , carbohydrate-binding modules , auxillary activities , and polysaccharide lyases  . the gts had  <dig> gene families and they transfers sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules by forming glycosidic bonds. the ghs are involved in hydrolysis of glycosidic bond between or within carbohydrate molecules, and  <dig> ghs families were identified in s. oryzae genome. similarly,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene families were identified in cbms, ces, aas, and pls, respectively.table  <dig> overview of cazyme and number of gene families in each cazyme categories


ghs glycoside hydrolases, gts glycosyl transferases, pls polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases, cbms carbohydrate-binding modules, aas auxillary activities



d. transcription factors 
transcription factors  play a vital role in signal transduction pathways by acting as a linker between signal flow and target gene expression. mining of specific repertoire of tfs in the genome gives us an overview about active pathways in the genome  <cit> . around  <dig>  protein sequences encoded for  <dig> different classes of tfs in s. oryzae . among seven classes of tfs, zn2cys <dig>  were majorly distributed followed by c2h <dig> zinc finger , bzip , heteromeric ccaat type , mads-box , myb , and grainyhead/cp <dig> . similar level of distribution of zn2cys <dig> tfs in ascomycota was reported by todd and co workers  <cit> . these tfs have multifunction in fungi like controlling cellular process like fungal fitness, sugar and amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis and respiration, vitamin synthesis, chromatin remodeling, nitrogen utilization and response to drug and stress  <cit> . these tfs are also known to control calcineurin signaling pathway that is more important for fungal pathogenicity. it is reported that immune-suppressive drug cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin synthesis in other plant pathogens like magnaporthe oryzae  <cit>  and botrytis cinerea  <cit>  affected the formation of infection structure resulting in reduced pathogenicity. another major class of tfs is c2h <dig> zinc finger, which are most common dna-binding motifs, around  <dig> genes contained this motif in s. oryzae. the basic leucine zipper  domain containing tfs is third largest family in the s. oryzae genome and they are known to regulate cellular growth and differentiation. there were  <dig> genes encoding for bzip tfs in s. oryzae. deletion mutants of this tfs showed defects in mycelial growth, development and reduced pathogenicity in magnaporthe pathosystem  <cit> . the repertoire of tfs signifies that s. oryzae genome fosters diverse classes of tfs required for activation of most of the fungal pathogenicity genes.table  <dig> distribution of transcription factors in s. oryzae genome



e. cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and membrane transporters
the cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in fungi carry out a wide range of bioconversions of complex polyaromatic hydrocarbons  and steroid compounds mediated by monooxygenase enzymes  <cit> . there were  <dig> genes distributed across  <dig> various cyp gene families  <cit>  in s. oryzae based on fungal cytochrome p <dig> database  . genes encoding for plasma membrane transporters will help in assimilating the products degraded by cazymes. the protein family classification of s. oryzae proteome revealed  <dig> genes encoding for major facilitator superfamily  and  <dig> genes encoding for sugar and other transporters. as compared to other gene families, mfs membrane transporters were high indicating their role in transporting small solutes in response to chemiosmotic ion gradients during pathogenesis.

f. pathway analysis of helvolic acid and cerulenin secondary metabolites production
secondary metabolites  are small bioactive molecules and they are essential for fungal growth and development. at the same time sms provide protection against various environmental stresses. the biosynthesis of sms is catalyzed by either nonribosomal peptides synthases , polyketide synthases , hybrid nrps-pks enzymes, prenyltransferases , and terpene cyclases . the catalytic activity of these enzymes results in production of sms respectively like nonribosomal peptides, polyketides, nrps-pks hybrids, indole alkaloids, and terpenes  <cit> . searching for sms revealed that s. oryzae genome is enriched with pkss, tcs followed by nrpss, nrpss-pkss hybrid clusters . several studies have reported that s. oryzae produces helvolic acid and cerulenin sms . the biosynthetic pathways of these sms were found to be different and concomitant production of these two metabolites might have synergistic effect to invade host by changing the cell permeability leading to leakage of electrolytes in the host tissue . so far, the studies on helvolic acid and cerulenin metabolites were restricted only to chromatographic assays and gene and protein level information of the pathways involved in their metabolism is unknown in s. oryzae. based on our sm analysis, we hypothesize that pkss, tcs and nrpss could be the putative enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these two metabolites in s. oryzae. we critically examined the proteome of s. oryzae to screen candidate genes involved in biosynthesis of these sms. helvolic acid is a steroidal antibiotic, known to be controlled by cluster of genes in aspergillus flavus  <cit>  and metarhizium anisophilae  <cit> . initial blastp searches of s. oryzae proteome against a. flavus protein sequences identified nine candidate genes in s. oryzae. the structural analysis showed these genes were single exonic genes arranged in clusters. among these gene clusters, four  cytochrome p <dig>  two  transferase family protein, one each of short chain dehydrogenase  , qualene-hopene-cyclase , and 3-ketosteroid-delta-1-dehydrogenase  genes . the structural arrangement of gene clusters was more similar to metarhizium aninophilae strain nwlb- <dig>  than a. flavus.fig.  <dig> the secondary metabolites gene clusters in s. oryzae. nrpss-nonribosomal peptides synthases, pkss-polyketide synthases, tcs-terpene cyclases, and dmatss-prenyltransferases

another important sm produced by s. oryzae is cerulenin and its biosynthesis is closely related to fattyacid synthesis  <cit> . the structure of cerulenin is ,   <dig> -epoxy-4-oxo- <dig>  10-do-decadienoyl amide concluded based on mass and nmr spectroscopic methods  <cit> . we looked at the enzymes involved in dodecanoic acid pathway under fatty acid biosynthesis. there are six enzymes  involved in biosynthesis of trans-dodeca-2-enoyl-, an intermediary product of dodecanoic acid pathway . the major protein domains of these enzymes are acyltransferase, oxidoreductase, and lyases. we identified putative candidate genes involved in cerulenin biosynthesis based on protein domain annotation. there were  <dig> short chain dehydrogenase ,  <dig> enoyl- reductases,  <dig> acyltransferase, seven beta-ketoacyl synthase, and  <dig> oxidoreductases genes found in s. oryzae genome. these genes are of future interest to understand its biosynthesis since cerulenin is mainly used as antifungal antibiotic and anticancer agent that inhibits fatty acid and steroid biosynthesis  <cit> . the knowledge of these pathway genes can be utilized for therapeutic and industrial uses, by exploring genetic engineering approaches to convert pathogenic strain to non-pathogenic strain for commercial purpose.

repetitive dna content
repetitive dna is an integral part of fungal genomes. repeat sequences play a vital role in generating genetic diversity, genome expansion and might also be detrimental to genome with respect to genome stability  <cit> . repetitive dna analysis was carried out on contig sequences of s. oryzae. the de novo and reference  based repeat analysis showed that  <dig>  % of genome was repetitive. interestingly, retro and dna transposons were absent. however, repetitive dna was limited to small rna , simple repeats  and low complexity repeats . then, we performed reference based repeat analysis by choosing repeat databases of closely related ascomycetes fungi like aspergillus, colletotrichum, fusarium, gibberella, magnaporthe and sarocladium zeae. however, we did not observe significant increase in content of repeat elements. many genome drafts of ascomycetes have been assembled using short read technologies, and have reported repeat percentage in the range of 3-10 %  <cit> . thus, we believe that sequence read length  might have not imposed a significant bias in repeat resolution. low content of repeat elements is surprising since most of the pathogenic ascomycetes fungi are known to harbor little higher percentage of repeat elements as compared to non-pathogenic counterparts. the low percentage of repeats can also be attributed to repeat induce point  mutations operating in the genome  <cit> . genome sequencing of other ascomycetes fungi like n. crassa, f. oxysporum, a. nidulans and a. fumigatus showed lower repeat content coupled with rip mechanism. thus, these fungal species and s. oryzae which are closely related, might be sharing similar phenomenon like rip in their genomes  <cit> .

identification of microsatellites in s. oryzae genome
microsatellites or ssrs markers are highly useful for molecular identification, genetic differentiation among individuals and populations in fungi. the genome-wide identification of ssrs in s. oryzae was performed in order to enrich genomic resources for population characterization. the scanning of  <dig>  mb s. oryzae genome revealed presence of  <dig>  ssrs. of which,  <dig> were simple and remaining  <dig> were complex types. the major proportion of simple ssrs was mononucleotide repeats occupying 50 % of total ssrs, followed by  <dig>  % dinucleotides ,  <dig>  % trinucleotides , and  <dig>  % tetranucleotides  repeats. the remaining ssrs were complex type, with  <dig>  % of penta and  <dig>  % of hexa nucleotides.

among mononucleotide repeats,  <dig>  % were poly ‘a/t’ , and  <dig>  % were ‘g/c’  types . among  <dig> dinucleotides microsatellites, ‘ga/tc’ type  of microsatellites were enriched in the genome followed by ‘ag/ct’ type , and ‘ac/gt’ type . the ‘cg/cg’ type dinucleotides microsatellites were present in lowest proportion . in case of trinucleotide microsatellites , around  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % of ssrs were of ‘aag/ctt’, ‘gaa/ttc’ and ‘ctg/gag’ types, respectively. the ‘cta/tag’ type was lowest  in the genome of s. oryzae. the poor distribution  of tetranucleotides ssrs was observed in the s. oryzae genome. the maximum number of tetra nucleotides repeats was of ‘tttc/gaaa’ type followed by ‘aaga/tctt’, ‘aaag/cttt’, and ‘tcca/tgga’. the overall analysis showed that the relative abundance of tetra, penta and hexa ssrs types were low as compared to mono, di and tri ssr types in s. oryzae genome. the similar observation was made in other ascomycetes fungi like a. nidulans, s. cerevisiae, f. graminearum, m. oryzae, and n. crassa  <cit> . hence, ssrs identified in this study will have immense importance in the immediate future to study population diversity, evolutionary pattern and understanding the virulence pattern of s. oryzae in the rice growing regions at global level.fig.  <dig> distribution of mono, di and tri repeat motifs in s. oryzae. inner, middle and outer circles represents mono, di, tri repeat types, respectively



CONCLUSIONS
rice sheath rot disease caused by s. oryzae is an emerging disease in rice growing regions. lack of genomic resource for s. oryzae motivated us to takeup this sequencing effort and report the first ever genome draft of s. oryzae. the whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly revealed  <dig>  mb is the genome size of s. oryzae. this genome of this fungus codes for  <dig>  proteins based on ab initio gene prediction algorithm. furthermore, functional annotation of proteins showed that  <dig>  % of total genes distributed across  <dig>  protein families. the gene ontology annotation showed  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of genes were involved in biological, cellular and molecular functions, respectively. comparative orthology studies revealed  <dig>  genes were orthologous to other ascomycetes fungi and remaining  genes were unique to s. oryzae. multigene families such as polyketide synthase, abc transporters and other pathogenicity related genes were distributed across  <dig> orthologous groups. the expansion of these gene families through natural selection denotes survival advantage of this pathogen for acclimatization to diverse environmental conditions. the overall analysis showed that s. oryzae has large sets of pathogenicity-related genes encoding secreted effectors, proteinases, secondary metabolism enzymes, transporters, carbohydrate-active enzymes, cytochrome p <dig> enzymes and transcription factors. this diversification and maintenance of more number of arsenal of diverse virulence factors may be required to colonize a wider range of host species by s. oyzae. more interestingly, helvolic acid biosynthesis pathway genes were found in a single cluster encoding for cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, transferase, short chain dehydrogenase , qualene-hopene-cyclase, and 3-ketosteroid-delta-1-dehydrogenase. genome-wide identification of microsatellites revealed that around  <dig>  % of ssrs were di, tri and tetra types, which could be explored in pathogen identification and population dynamic studies. prior to elucidation of this draft genome sequence, very little was known about molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenicity and research in this area was limited to metabolite studies. indeed, the availability of this genome in the public domain from our sequencing effort will now allow the researchers to carry out accelerated and rational experiments to dissect rice-sarocladium interaction that may help to articulate better disease control measures.
