BACKGROUND
it is well-established that epigenetic marks are altered in cancer cells . these alterations may play important roles in cancer
 <cit> . different cancers appear to have different patterns of epigenetic changes. importantly, drugs aimed at epigenetic processes are currently used for clinical treatment of cancer
 <cit> . understanding the specific actions of these drugs and the genomic loci of their action may lead to future treatments that are more specific. currently, there is intense work on developing new drugs aimed at epigenetic processes for cancer treatment and gaining a more detailed understanding of the specific steps involved in the action of these drugs on cancer cells. the efficacy of these drugs may rely, in part, upon the specific spectrum of epigenetic changes in the cancer cells and specific patterns of epigenetic changes may produce differential drug sensitivity among patients
 <cit> . hence, gaining a better understanding of epigenetic changes in different types of cancer cells is critical.

glioblastoma multiforme is a deadly cancer under intensive investigation on a genomic level as part of the the cancer genome atlas  project
 <cit> . in this cancer, it is believed that a specific population of cells - brain tumor stem cells  - plays a crucial role in the tumors. it has been proposed that targeting these cells may be essential for successful treatment of this cancer
 <cit> .

several previous findings point toward the need for systematic investigation of dna methylation and the three histone marks h3k27me <dig>  h3k9me <dig>  and h3k4me <dig> in btscs. changes in dna methylation have been widely reported in cancer cells, are believed to play a major role in cancer cell behavior, and are the target of current drug and diagnostic marker development efforts
 <cit> . furthermore, changes in dna methylation appear to be important in differentiation, including neural lineage cell differentiation
 <cit> . finally, in some btscs, the bmp differentiation pathway is silenced by aberrational methylation of the bmprb <dig> gene promoter, producing resistance to differentiation for these cells
 <cit> . hence, understanding dna methylation patterns is critical. similarly, h3k27me <dig> is important to investigate because it has repeatedly been shown to be an powerful repressive epigenetic mark in promoters, the underlying enzymes controlling this mark are known to be dysregulated or mutated in many cancers
 <cit> , and changes in the distribution of this mark are important in differentiation of neural stem cells
 <cit> . in some btscs, ezh <dig>  a key member of the prc <dig> complex that mediates the production of h3k27me <dig> marks, is upregulated and plays a pivotal role in glioblastoma tumor growth
 <cit> . h3k4me <dig> is important as a marker of open chromatin
 <cit> , has also been shown to change in localization during differentiation
 <cit> , and is strongly correlated with gene expression
 <cit> , and hence was also a target of this study. finally, h3k9me <dig> is prevalent but shows a very divergent localization to h3k27me3
 <cit>  and is well known as an important component of lengthy regions of heterochromatin in some cases
 <cit> . in sum, these results strongly suggest pivotal roles for these epigenetic marks in btscs.

here, we performed a preliminary survey of these epigenetic marks in four lines of brain tumor stem cells. these four lines have been shown to be multipotent
 <cit> . we wished to compare our results to normal neural stem cells, which may be the cell type of origin for btscs
 <cit> . to model this normal population, we used normal fetal human neural stem cells, which robustly grow under typical cell culture conditions. we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation applied to microarrays  and methylated dna immunoprecipitation applied to microarrays  technologies.

we investigated three fundamental manifestations
 <cit>  of these four epigenetic marks. best known are “focal peaks”, localized regions of epigenetic modification. abundant evidence supports the key role of these modifications in transcriptional regulation when present in proximal promoters
 <cit> . less studied, but prevalent in the human genome, are long regions continuously possessing a epigenetic modification . we operationally define a peak as a broad modification if it is >50 kb in extent. many lengthy heterochromatic regions possess these long regions of h3k27me <dig> or h3k9me3
 <cit> . finally, we also investigated bivalent promoters, which are promoters possessing two “opposing” epigenetic marks, usually h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me3
 <cit> . these bivalent promoters may play a key role in producing or maintaining fundamental stem cell properties
 <cit> . hence we investigated their distribution in btscs.

we addressed the following specific questions in this study. how similar are the btscs from an epigenetic mark perspective? how do btscs and neural stem cells differ in epigenetic mark localization across the genome? do we observe differences in broad modifications among btsc types and neural stem cells? how different are the collections of bivalent promoters among the btsc types and fnscs?

we began by determining a set of promoters that possess each mark in every btsc type . this core set was a substantial proportion of the total set of promoters bearing a given mark for each btsc, indicating a significant core set but also significant epigenetic diversity among btscs. for each epigenetic mark, nearly all the core set was found in the corresponding fnsc set, indicating great commonalities between fnscs and the common btsc set of epigenetic mark localizations. however, fnscs and btscs, when compared in a pairwise manner, revealed large differences. therefore, although there is a substantial “core” set for each epigenetic mark, individual cell types have many other sites that are not shared with all the rest of the group. the total number of h3k9me3+ promoters varied markedly among some cell types, indicating differences in the activity of the h3k9me <dig> production/maintenance system among cell types. this system may present possibilities for therapeutic intervention in some groups of patients. we found that “broad modifications”, large areas of genomic space possessing an epigenetic mark , also showed marked differences in presence or extent among cell types. we demonstrated that these differences were transcriptionally relevant. given that the mechanisms producing these broad regions are significantly different than those producing focal peaks, this system may also present therapeutic possibilities. finally, we surprisingly found that the collection of bivalent promoters also differs greatly by btsc type, even though all our cell types were multipotent
 <cit> . only a small number of bivalent promoters were common to all five cell types. these observations suggest that bivalent promoter roles should be further investigated in these cells. in total, our results provide first steps toward understanding the epigenome of these cells and indicate that successful targeting of btscs using epigenome-aimed drugs may require careful patient-by-patient analyses.

RESULTS
chip-chip and medip-chip in btscs and fnscs
to investigate the distribution of epigenetic marks, we used the  <dig>  million probe nimblegen hd <dig> microarray, a design centered around promoter regions, most of which are 10 kb in extent with 7 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the transcription start site and 100 bp probe spacing. in addition, this array design also includes a set of large tiled regions . we performed typical chip-chip and medip-chip protocols . we produced single microarray experiments for our twenty conditions .

we used several approaches to validate our microarray data. we started with the classical approach of examining known sites of modification  in our microarray data . examination of this data for each mark revealed not just consistent presence of the expected epigenetic mark, but also that the waveforms were very similar across different cell types. this suggests that technical noise was quite low. in addition, we compared our data to public encode consortium data for these same regions
 <cit> . this encode chip-seq data and methylation data from other cell types also closely matched the waveforms and location of our signals. this is consistent with reliable signals across experiments.

we next sought to examine this issue on a global scale. we examined promoters as to enrichment for different marks by using the maxfour methodology . these analyses have been previously used
 <cit> . examples are displayed in additional file
1: figure s <dig>  to begin, we expect that when a promoter in one cell type has a strong signal for h3k27me <dig>  then that promoter will most often display a strong signal in a second, closely related cell type. due to cell type differences, there will be some promoters violating this pattern. in additional file
1: figure s6a, we demonstrate that the enrichment values for h3k27me <dig> are well-correlated between b <dig> cells and fnscs, with some clear sites showing cell-type specificity. in contrast, as expected, few promoters have both high h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> values . similarly, few promoters have both high h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> signals . these graphs closely resemble previous published results and closely match expectations from previous studies
 <cit> . finally, we used the following logic. in a set of distinct, but closely related cell types, we expect that many positive sites that show variability between cell types will still be found in at least two cell types. we found that the great majority of promoters showing a signal for an epigenetic mark  were found in at least two cell types and a large number were found in all four btsc types . in contrast, we found that promoters positive in only one cell type were rare, except for the case of h3k9me <dig>  .

similar numbers of sites across cell types except in the case of h3k9me3
we examined differences among cell types using two different approaches for each epigenetic mark: total number of positive sites  and total number of proximal promoters possessing at least one peak . to determine the number of positive sites , we used the full set of peaks supplied by nimblegen . we focused on proximal promoter regions because these regions are key for epigenetic transcriptional regulation. also, these regions are well-represented in this microarray design. to study these regions, we took positive sites  and mapped them to an existing nimblegen proximal promoter array design in which the tiled region for promoters is designed to span the transcription start site . then, we could score each promoter as positive for a given mark or negative based on presence of a peak in this proximal promoter. all analyses in our work used this promoter-centric dataset unless otherwise noted. we also repeated our basic analyses  using a more stringent peak selection criterion .

the results of these analyses are displayed in figure 
 <dig>  these analyses revealed one striking result and one more minor observation. for h3k9me <dig>  there were large differences in number of sites and number of positive promoters across cell types, with the b <dig> line and fnscs having many more positive promoters than b <dig> cells . second, a more minor observation concerns the relative number of h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> peaks vs positive promoters. there were more h3k4me <dig> positive promoters than h3k27me <dig> positive promoters, as opposed to the total peak analysis. this result implies that a large proportion of h3k27me <dig> peaks were found outside of proximal promoter regions or that there was a greater number of h3k27me <dig> peaks per promoter.figure  <dig>

we found the h3k9me <dig> difference between b <dig> and b <dig> cells surprising because our close examination of some known sites  did not demonstrate any obvious differences. the b <dig> peak waveforms and amplitudes at these control sites did not differ from those of the other cell types in this study. therefore, we employed two additional global analysis approaches. first, analysis of only high confidence peaks  also yielded large differences between b <dig> cells and b <dig> cells in both total number of peaks and total number of positive promoters for h3k9me <dig> . hence, the observed differences cannot be attributed to the use of generous parameters. second, we used the maxfour approach  beginning with quantile normalized and smoothed data to examine this conclusion. this method predicted the same rank order as the nimblegen analyses in number of positive promoters . furthermore, examination of the distribution of maxfour values revealed a strong positive shift in the b <dig> distribution as compared to that of b <dig> cells, indicating that many more promoters had higher h3k9me <dig> signals in b <dig> cells . therefore, use of two different analysis approaches using two different data preprocessing methods , and varying parameters for the nimblegen peak determination, yielded qualitatively similar conclusions. this large difference in h3k9me <dig> positive promoter counts among these cells points toward a significantly altered h3k9me <dig> system for some types of btscs as compared to fnscs.figure  <dig>

similarities and differences among btscs in epigenetic mark locations
epigenetic marks are controllers of gene transcription and hence play an essential role in establishing cellular identity. different types of cells can be distinguished by comparing epigenetic mark distributions and these distributions can even be used to predict relatedness of cell types
 <cit> . we sought to address the issue of epigenetic similarities and differences among btscs. we used the promoter-centric analysis because marks in proximal promoter sites are crucial for transcriptional control. furthermore, this analysis approach eliminates some methodological noise concerns . additionally, we validated qualitative results using a different analysis method . for each epigenetic mark, we computed two different basic sets. first, we computed a “core” set of positive promoters for each mark that are present in every btsc . these core sets probably contain epigenetic modification sites that produce the btsc phenotype. second, to gain an idea of the total variability in locations among cell types for a given epigenetic mark, we also computed a “universe” set that includes every promoter that is positive for a given epigenetic mark, whether in only one type of btsc, or in two, three, or all four types .

to interpret this data, we employed the following logic for each epigenetic mark. if different btscs share most of their positive promoters, then the core set will be a large fraction of the universe set. conversely, if there are fewer shared positive promoters, then the core set will be a small fraction of the universe set, because most positive promoters will not be present in all four cell types.

analysis of this data yielded several conclusions. first, there was a substantial core set of positive promoters for each epigenetic mark . second, this core set, although large, was less than half of the universe set in each case . we were concerned that the relative size of the core set would be greatly reduced if there were a single “outlier” cell type that shared few sites with the other cell types. to investigate this possibility, we performed a more detailed analysis categorizing each site as belonging to either exactly one, two, three or all four types of btscs . these results, in conjunction with detailed analysis of the composition of sites found in the “only present in one type” set, indicated that no single cell type was strongly biasing results. overall, these results establish a large core set for each epigenetic mark that will be useful for further functional understanding of the general features of the btsc phenotype. however, these results also demonstrate significant differences in the epigenetic landscape among btscs.

we performed gene ontology analysis using the david server
 <cit>  for each of the core sets . for h3k4me <dig>  we found enrichment of a large number of categories, with prominent enrichment in general gene ontology terms . notably, other terms potentially related to cancer also showed enrichment such as “go: 0006974 ~ response to dna damage stimulus” and “go: 0007049 ~ cell cycle”. for h3k9me <dig>  we found prominent enrichment of the cell adhesion and zinc-finger gene categories , and consistent gene ontology categories for these ). for h3k27me <dig>  analysis revealed enrichment of categories related to cell surface receptors, in particular g-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. finally, for methylated dna, analysis showed marked enrichment in categories related to transcriptional regulation and dna binding categories. in sum, these results imply a complicated scenario in which there is potentially prominent and pan-btsc repression of various transcriptional regulation genes  and cell surface molecules , along with activation of various genes potentially linked to the cancer phenotype . further exploration of these topics will probably require extensive experimentation, including large scale gene expression data.

epigenetic differences among fnscs and btscs
there is significant evidence that neural stem cells may be the cell-type of origin for btscs
 <cit> . we sought to determine changes in epigenetic mark locations induced by the putative transformation of neural stem cells  to btscs. we reasoned that these epigenetic alterations may give insight into  key sites of epigenetic marks that produce or contribute to the cancerous btsc phenotype or  may provide avenues for therapeutic intervention, even if these new sites do not directly produce the cancer phenotype. these analyses rely on the assumption that human fnscs are a good model for the epigenetic marks of the normal cell-type of origin for our btscs.

we are interested in two basic set of changes . first, we examine which epigenetic marks at which promoters are changed in every btsc as compared to fnscs. this conservative set may point toward key sites and potentially provide mechanistic insights into this reprogramming. second, we examine which epigenetic marks are changed in at least one type of btsc as compared to fnscs. this larger set may point toward a set of promoters than can be epigenetically reprogrammed in the cancer process and, via overall analysis, may give insight into underlying mechanisms or molecular components of this large-scale reprogramming. on a technical level, this set is also important for derivation of changes that occur in comparing fnscs to every btsc .figure  <dig>

we were particularly interested in alterations found in every btsc vs fnscs. full datasets are present in additional files

 <dig> 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  as shown in figure 
3a, these changes could be gain of an epigenetic mark in every type of btsc  or loss of an epigenetic mark in every type of btsc . to derive these changes, we examined differences among the fnsc set and the universe and core sets of btsc promoters for each epigenetic mark .

this analysis revealed a relatively small set of changes that occurred in every btsc vs. fnscs . for h3k4me <dig>  h3k27me <dig> and mec, the number of promoters that lost the marks  significantly outweighed the number of promoters that gained the marks . for h3k9me <dig>  the difference was very large . the large number of h3k9me <dig> locations that are lost and the small number gained may be due to the small size of the core h3k9me3+ promoter set . the small core set size is partially caused by large differences among btsc types in number of h3k9me <dig> marked promoters, as analyzed above .

inspection of the universe set results indicated that, overall, thousands of promoters can be reprogrammed in the putative nsc - > btsc transformation for each epigenetic mark.

we examined the composition of the group of consistent precursor cell  to btsc changes  for each epigenetic mark using the david server . we separately analyzed sets of gains and losses. gene ontology analysis revealed only a few notable upregulated categories. for h3k9me <dig>  btscs gained this mark for zinc finger genes. for h3k27me <dig>  btscs gained this mark for receptors, especially g-protein coupled receptors, and lost this mark in the categories of embryonic limb morphogenesis and skeletal development. for dna methylation, there were clear gains in genes related to the general categories of transcription and development and clear losses in genes in the categories of receptors and the general category of membrane. overall, these results point toward a complex picture in which potentially some zinc finger genes gain repression , some receptors are newly repressed  and other receptors are potentially activated , and genes related to transcription are also potentially repressed  and some developmental genes are activated  and some repressed . the core data sets themselves have a biased gene ontology category composition, so these results are in part due to core set composition effects. further experimental investigation of btscs will be required to address the specifics of these processes.

regions of broad modification vary among cell types
we use the term “broad modification” to denote long regions of chromosomal space in which there is a given epigenetic modification present continuously , as opposed to focal regions of modification  in a promoter or other region. these broad modifications are prevalent in the human genome
 <cit> . the mechanisms that create broad modifications are believed to be significantly different from those that create focal modifications
 <cit> . hence, variations among cell types in this type of modification implicates mechanisms different than those involved in focal peak dynamics. here, we examine variation in broad modifications among our five cell types.

to study alterations in broad modifications, we examined the longer regions represented in this microarray format . strikingly, cell type differences were found in  <dig> of  <dig> regions for h3k27me <dig> . in contrast, clear changes in broad modifications were much less prevalent for h3k9me <dig>  and were absent for mec and h3k4me <dig> . these results imply frequent dysregulation of h3k27me <dig> spreading and less prevalent changes in h3k9me <dig> spreading. due to the limitations of this microarray format with respect to investigating broad modifications, conclusions around these results must be tentative.figure  <dig>

we next examined whether broad region variation among cell types was relevant to transcriptional regulation. the chr19:  <dig> -  <dig> region encompasses the cacng <dig> gene . this gene has been recently described as being routinely downregulated in btscs as compared to normal neural stem cells
 <cit> . in this region, we found a broad modification  in b <dig> cells but not in b <dig> cells. this broad modification was restricted to h3k9me <dig> and was not present with h3k27me <dig> in this region . we examined mrna levels of cacng <dig> using quantitative pcr and found that b <dig> cells had higher levels than b <dig> cells . this difference was very large . hence, the change in the presence of this broad region of h3k9me <dig> is correlated with a large difference in mrna levels for cacng <dig>  suggesting that these changes in broad modifications can have transcriptional, and presumably ultimately functional, consequences.figure  <dig>

bivalent promoters
“bivalent promoters” are promoters that possess two “opposing” epigenetic marks, most commonly h3k4me <dig> in combination with h3k27me3
 <cit> . this class of promoters is prominent in stem cells and is believed to contribute significantly to the multipotent nature of tissue-specific stem cells
 <cit> . we surveyed bivalent promoters in btscs and sought to determine whether there were regular patterns of differences among fnscs and btscs. as in previous analyses, we assume that the fnsc epigenetic patterns are a good model for those of the normal precursor cells of btscs.

we used a conservative selection strategy to find proximal promoters that showed clear evidence of strong presence of two epigenetic marks  or h3k4me3+/h3k9me3+ ; see methods for details) in a single promoter. detailed lists are presented in additional files
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> 
 <dig> and
 <dig>  visual inspection of a random subset of these bivalent promoters showed that, qualitatively, in the majority of cases, the epigenetic marks seemed to occupy different regions of the promoter ). hence, direct, clear overlap of marks for the same probes was observed infrequently ). to quantify this observation, we performed a preliminary analysis of bivalent promoters in b <dig> cells. we analyzed each k4/k <dig> or k4/k <dig> promoter to determine if the peaks were overlapping or separate. we found that 37%  k4/k <dig> promoters and 40%  of k4/k <dig> promoters had non-overlapping peaks . our analysis method will underestimate the fraction of non-overlapping histone modifications because peak widths are larger than the actual underlying chromatin modification. this is due to the size of chromatin fragments used in chip experiments. this situation produces apparent overlap when the underlying modifications are separated in genomic space. nonetheless, these results support the existence of a major population of bivalent promoters with non-overlapping histone modifications. modeling the relationship of underlying modification to peak morphology may allow better quantification in the future.

we began by analyzing k4/k <dig> bivalent promoters. we found that the number varied considerably among cell lines ranging from  <dig> in b <dig> cells to  <dig> in fnscs . analysis of bivalent promoter changes from fnscs to any single type of btsc demonstrated large alterations and substantial diversity among patterns in different cell types. there were few bivalent promoters found in all  <dig> cell types  and fewer that went from bivalent in fnscs to losing both marks in all btscs  . these results point toward notable diversity in k4/k <dig> bivalent promoters for each cell type.

we performed similar analyses with bivalent k4/k <dig> promoters. we found that the number of k4/k <dig> bivalent promoters also varied substantially among cell lines ). comparison of the fnsc set to sets from individual btsc types revealed substantial overlap. however, there was only a small set of bivalent promoters found in all btscs and fnscs, and fewer still that lost both marks in all btscs  as compared to fnscs . these results indicate considerable differences between each cell type in the set of k4/k <dig> bivalent promoters.

we were particularly interested in epigenetic differences between fnscs and btscs at these bivalent promoters, because loss of bivalency is often considered an important step in differentiation. alterations from k4+/k27+ to only k4+ would poise a promoter for activation ). we found  <dig> promoters that went from k4+/k27+ in fnscs to only k4+ in all btscs. gene ontology analysis of the associated genes yielded mostly general categories except for categories linked to transcription  and proto-oncogenes .

in contrast, alterations from k4+/k27+ to solely k27+ would place a promoter in a repressive state ). we found  <dig> promoters that went from k4+/k27+ in fnscs to only k27+ in all btscs. gene ontology analysis of the associated genes yielded categories  linked to ion channels , but no statistically significant gene ontology categories.figure  <dig>

similar logic holds for k4+/k9+ promoters. we found  <dig> promoters that went from k4+/k9+ in fnscs to only k4+ in all btscs. gene ontology analysis of the associated genes yielded categories  linked to transcription  and “mental retardation”, but no statistically significant gene ontology consortium categories.

we found  <dig> promoters that went from k4+/k9+ in fnscs to only k9+ in all btscs. gene ontology analysis of the associated genes yielded a number of categories linked to cell adhesion, including go:0016337 ~ cell-cell adhesion.

taken together, these analyses point toward potential activation of genes linked to transcription and proto-oncogenes due to loss of the repressive mark  and potential repression of genes linked to cell adhesion  and ion channels . again, these results are in part related to the composition of the core sets for each epigenetic mark .

discussion
in this report, we surveyed four well-studied epigenetic marks using chip-chip/medip-chip in four brain tumor cell lines and fetal neural stem cells. we used fetal neural stem cells as a model for the normal cell type of origin of the brain tumor stem cells. the four epigenetic marks  have been shown to play important roles in transcriptional regulation and function of neural precursor cells
 <cit> , the putative precursor cells for btscs
 <cit> . our primary goals were to identify similarities and differences among the brain tumor stem cell lines and also to understand potential epigenetic reprogramming from neural stem cells to brain tumor stem cells. we surveyed various epigenetic phenomena, including focal peaks, areas of broad modification, and bivalent promoters. for most of our analyses, we performed a promoter-centric analysis by mapping peaks to proximal promoter regions, where the presence of an epigenetic mark has a great probability of affecting transcription
 <cit> . our primary conclusions were as follows.  we identified a “core set” of promoters possessing each epigenetic mark in every surveyed btsc cell type. however, different btsc lines showed large numbers of sites differing from the core set for each epigenetic mark.  the core set was largely found also in fnscs, with only a small number of mark locations showing consistent changes from fnscs to btscs. however, for any single btsc type vs. fnscs, there were relatively large numbers of differences detected.  h3k9me <dig> showed robust and large differences among cell types in total number of positive promoters and peaks, pointing toward differences in the h3k9me <dig> producing or maintenance system among these cell types.  we detected significant and clear changes in broad modification areas for h3k27me <dig> and, to a lesser extent, for h3k9me <dig>  implying that the processes creating or maintaining these broad modifications differed in activity among cell types; in one case we verified that this change in a broad modification affected gene expression.  we detected large numbers of bivalent promoters. most bivalent promoters did not display direct overlap of epigenetic mark signals. rather, the opposing marks seemed to occupy nearby regions of the proximal promoter.  there were considerable differences in the sets of promoters bearing bivalent marks in the different cell types and few consistent changes from fnscs to btscs.

a key result of this work was the determination of the “core sets” - a set of promoters for each epigenetic mark that have the epigenetic mark in every btsc. because similar cell types show significant similarities in the sets of promoters bearing a given epigenetic mark
 <cit> , the existence of a significant core set was not surprising. however, we also detected a large amount of variability among the btscs; for each epigenetic mark, the core set comprised well less than half of the total set  of positive promoters. given previous gene expression work, this variability among btscs is not surprising. gene expression analyses across glioblastoma multiforme tumors taken in toto has shown that there are significant subclasses of glioblastoma that differ in large ways in gene expression patterns
 <cit> . furthermore, gene expression data from a panel of btscs  indicated significant variability among the btscs in gene expression patterns
 <cit> . finally, preliminary gene expression array data from the btscs used in the study  indicates that the btscs used in this study vary significantly in gene expression patterns.

overall, gene expression studies across different types of btscs and neural stem cells demonstrate large sets of genes that are downregulated in one cell type versus another and even in btscs as a class vs. neural stem cells . a recent analysis
 <cit>  concluded that, unlike our previous findings in liver cancer
 <cit> , copy number changes explained only a small amount of variation in gene expression between btscs and normal neural stem cells and that therefore other mechanisms must be important. hence, the data in our study, in conjunction with other results, can point toward the potential epigenetic basis of gene repression in these btscs. this can be seen most clearly by a brief examination of the recent results of engström et al. . tusc <dig> is of particular interest because engström et al.  establish that it is down regulated in glioblastoma cells as compared to neural stem cells and this gene was part of a key set of genes predicting survivability of patients. in bulk glioblastoma tumor samples
 <cit> , which comprise both btscs and non-btscs, this gene is repressed via promoter dna methylation. however, in our btsc samples, we find that h3k27me <dig> in the tusc <dig> promoter may be the major repressor. similarly, tes levels have been described as discriminating normal neural stem cells from btscs
 <cit> . this gene is downregulated via promoter dna methylation in bulk tumor samples
 <cit> . again, in contrast, we detect strong h3k27me <dig> signals across btsc types for this gene’s promoter and little sign of promoter methylation, implying that h3k27me <dig>  not dna methylation, is probably the repressive mark. these results highlight the importance of studying epigenetic marks directly in btscs as opposed to solely tumor samples or other glioblastoma cell lines. rational targeting of gene expression in btscs using drugs aimed at epigenetic processes obviously requires understanding of the epigenetic marks that are affecting gene expression specifically in the context of btscs, which may differ from other glioblastoma cell types.

comparison of the core set for each epigenetic mark with the corresponding set for fnscs revealed that the core sets were almost entirely found in the corresponding fnsc sets. this indicates that the core set is basically shared not only among the four btscs but also fnscs. however, comparison of the fnsc epigenetic patterns to any single type of btsc revealed large differences. this may point toward individualized therapeutic targets for patients with a given type of btsc. rational drug treatment based on specific properties of a tumor, perhaps even btscs derived from an individual tumor, may become a relevant clinical possibility as personalized medicine becomes a larger part of cancer therapy and there is a greater understanding of the overall systems biology of different btscs and fnscs.

striking and robust differences were found among cell types in the number of promoters bearing the h3k9me <dig> mark, which points toward different levels of activity of the systems establishing and/or maintaining this mark in these cell types. h3k9me <dig> appears to have complex actions in gene regulation
 <cit> , but clearly plays an important role in neural progenitor cells in producing sustained inactivation of some genes and also plays a large role in some heterochromatic regions
 <cit> . we also noted differences among cell types in large broad regions of modification with h3k9me <dig>  we establish the transcriptional relevance of a difference in an h3k9me3+ broad modification in that it affected transcription of cacng <dig>  cacng <dig> has been described as being downregulated in btscs vs normal neural stem cells
 <cit> . these differences among cell types, in particular among some of the btscs and fnscs, present the intriguing possibility that this h3k9me <dig> system may be a relevant target for anti-btsc therapy.

we detected differences among cell types in broad modification regions for h3k27me <dig> in many of the more lengthy regions that were tiled in this array format. unfortunately, this array format only covers a portion of the genome, hence, it will be necessary to use other methods, most likely chip-seq, to fully establish the prevalence of differences in broad modifications for this mark across different cell types. however, our work provides compelling evidence that broad regions of modification should be a focus of future research, in that regions may play important roles in shaping the biology of these cells and may present therapeutic targets. targeting the mechanisms that produce these broad regions of epigenetic change represents a potential frontier for epigenetic targeted cancer therapies.

for all five cell types, bivalent promoters, in most cases, had the two opposing epigenetic marks occupying different portions of the proximal promoters, although usually the marks were found directly adjacent to each other. this presents a different picture than that usually associated with bivalent promoters, in which the epigenetic mark signals actually overlap each other
 <cit> . the observation of adjacency has clear mechanistic implications. first, this observation implies that different histone complexes would have each mark. in contrast, for the case of overlapping opposing marks, the traditional interpretation is that both marks are  on the same histone tail. in some cases, this has been directly been shown to be so
 <cit> . our preliminary gene expression results  indicate that, like the “overlapping” bivalent promoters, these “non-overlapping” bivalent promoters yield very low gene expression, particularly in the case of h3k4me3+/h3k27me3+ bivalent promoters. we also analyzed the case of h3k4me3+/h3k9me3+ bivalent promoters. these bivalent promoters were rarer than h3k4me3+/h3k27me3+ bivalent promoters. a portion of the bivalent promoter set  from any single btsc type was shared with fnscs but there was only a small set of bivalent promoters that were shared among all btscs and fnscs.

the btscs in this study are multipotent
 <cit> , as are fnscs. because bivalent promoters have been thought important for multipotency, we initially hypothesized that the bivalent promoter set shared among all btscs and fnscs  would be relatively large in absolute number and as a proportion of all bivalent promoters in these cells. we can rationalize the relatively small common set and relatively large set of bivalent promoters for each individual cell type in several ways. first, it is possible that the cancerous nature of the btscs has produced other genomic alterations that affect the bivalent promoter system. second, bivalent promoters may play important roles in allowing rapid committed cell production but may not be essential for it
 <cit> . third, there may be several different sets of bivalent promoters that can all support multipotency. fourth, bivalent promoters may be less important for multipotency than previously thought. fifth, only a small conserved set of bivalent promoters may be important for multipotency, while most bivalent promoters have other or minor roles. our common set of bivalent promoters across cell types may include these critical promoters. sixth, differences in bivalent promoter sets may, in part, produce biases toward production of different types of committed lineage cells. differentiating among these possibilities will require extensive further investigation.

in general, the spectrum of similarities and differences in sites of epigenetic marks shown in this study suggest different programs of epigenetic change  for these different btscs. in particular, given the growing evidence for the dynamic nature of epigenetic marks at many sites and the need for active maintenance of these marks at many sites
 <cit> , these sets of differences may be actively maintained in each cell type. with this scenario, there may be many points of intervention for possible therapeutic targeting. although gene ontology analyses of cell type differences revealed some suggestive categories, there were no striking findings of differences. successful therapeutic intervention may rely on gaining a more detailed, systems biology view of these different cell types. while this may seem a daunting prospect, the rapid advances in high-throughput technologies, particularly in omics fields, coupled with declining costs and higher quality datasets can provide hope for this possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
in total, this work takes significant steps toward understanding the epigenetic marks in these btscs on a large genomic scale. we establish a core set of promoters for each epigenetic mark that bear the mark across every btsc. our work also points toward mechanisms of repression for genes in these cells, which is of particular interest as btsc gene expression profiles and patient survival time are correlated
 <cit> . we find substantial differences among cell types in broad modifications and bivalent promoters. these results indicate substantial variation in activity of the production/maintenance systems for h3k9me <dig> and for broad regions of modification . interestingly, bivalent promoters often had the two opposing marks immediately adjacent to each other in the proximal promoter as opposed to having direct overlap. the large variability among btscs may indicate that the systems biology of these cells may vary greatly and that future epigenetic therapies should be targeted toward subpopulations of patients, or in the extreme, individual patients.
