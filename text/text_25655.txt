BACKGROUND
synaptic and extrasynaptic nmda receptors are, respectively, coupled to survival and cell death pathways, which involves their opposing effects on the camp response element binding protein   <cit>  and their regulation of overlapping but distinct genomic programs recently revealed by a whole genome transcriptome analysis  <cit> . the differential role of nmda receptors provides a new concept explaining how the same receptor, dependent on its location, can couple to both survival and death. this concept represents an alternative to the "ca2+ load" hypothesis, which attempts to assign a toxic threshold to ca2+ influx associated with nmda receptor activation  <cit> . precisely how nmda receptors differentially regulate the activity of creb or signaling molecules such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinases  <dig> and  <dig>  is unknown, but differences in the nmda receptor subunit composition and/or differences in signaling complexes associated with synaptic versus extrasynaptic nmda receptors may be important  <cit> .

the toxic effects of extrasynaptic nmda receptor activation can be counteracted to some extent by prior activation of synaptic nmda receptors. for example, prolonged periods action potential  bursting-induced with the gabaa receptor antagonist, bicuculline in cultured hippocampal networks robustly activates synaptic nmda receptors, which protects against subsequent nmda-induced excitotoxicity  <cit>  as well as against pro-apoptotic stimuli such as serum deprivation  <cit>  or staurosporine treatment  <cit> . similarly, minor ischemic events or preconditioning systemic doses of nmda are neuroprotective  <cit> . the neuroprotective effects of preconditioning neurons with low concentrations of nmda are mediated, at least in cultured hippocampal networks, via ap-induced stimulation of synaptic nmda receptors  <cit> . the molecules responsible for synaptic nmda receptor-induced survival represent potential clinical targets to reduce neuron loss associated with pathological conditions including stroke and neurodegenerative diseases in which nmda receptor-mediated excitotoxicity has been implicated  <cit> .

nmda receptor-mediated neuroprotection appears to involve multiple players including nuclear ca2+ signaling, creb, nuclear factor kappa b, erk1/ <dig>  akt <dig>  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase c epsilon, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor  <cit> . given the central role of extrasynaptic nmda receptors in cell death, it is also conceivable that signal-induced changes in surface expression or function of this pool of receptors could profoundly affect the susceptibility of neurons to toxic insults. the surface expression of nmda receptors  is dynamic, whereby receptor endocytosis, exocytosis, and lateral movement are strongly regulated by activity  <cit> . the first step in determining whether changes in the relative distribution of nmda receptors  are associated with and responsible for activity and nmda receptor-induced neuronal survival, requires a method that allows the precise quantitative assessment of extrasynaptic nmda receptor function in individual neurons.

techniques for the identification of the extrasynaptic nmda receptor pool in brain slices are emerging  <cit> . however, considerable advances have been made in isolating extrasynaptic nmda receptor function in cultured neurons. such studies have employed a protocol, which specifically blocks synaptic nmda receptors with mk- <dig>  mk- <dig> is a use-dependent open channel nmda receptor blocker, which enters the channel only after its activation but then becomes trapped inside the pore to "irreversibly" block the receptor as long as the receptor is not re-activated to release the blocker  <cit> . extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated currents have been measured in single neurons isolated in micro-island cultures after blocking autaptic synapses with mk- <dig> during synaptic stimulation  <cit> . techniques for quantifying extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated currents in cultures of neuronal networks have also been developed but the parameters necessary for use-dependent blockade of nmda receptors require refinement. mass activation of synaptic nmda receptors in neuronal networks of hippocampal cultures can be achieved using the gabaa receptor antagonist, bicuculline, which initiates recurrent synchronous bursting  <cit> . mk- <dig> application during bicuculline-induced bursting in hippocampal cultures provides a use-dependent blockade of synaptic nmda receptors allowing the extrasynaptic nmda receptor population to be subsequently activated with bath applied nmda  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that the known neuroprotection afforded by synaptic nmda receptor activation is mediated by changes in the surface expression and/or function of extrasynaptically localized nmda receptors. a method based on previously used protocols was refined and verified in order to isolate extrasynaptic nmda receptors and quantify their function in individual neurons that are part of a complex neuronal network. we found a surprisingly small neuron-to-neuron variation in extrasynaptic nmda receptor function. overnight network bursting, stimulating synaptic nmda receptors, led to a measurable but very small loss of extrasynaptic nmda receptor function, which seemed dwarfed by the dramatic neuroprotective effect of this treatment.

RESULTS
mk- <dig> treatment in bursting networks effectively isolates the extrasynaptic pool of nmda receptors
to establish the necessary parameters to isolate extrasynaptic nmda receptors in hippocampal cultures, we first examined the blockade of synaptic nmda receptor evoked epscs by mk- <dig> during bicuculline-induced bursts of aps. the protocol is described in the methods section and schematically represented in figure 1a. both before and after the mk- <dig> blocking protocol epscs were measured at + <dig> mv in the presence of  <dig> mm mg2+ as well as gabaa and ampa receptor antagonists. these recordings were not feasible at negative holding potentials in the absence of mg2+ due to the appearance of multiple nmda receptor-mediated epscs evoked by single stimuli . although nmda and ampa components of epscs can be differentiated from each other, the continuous barrage of epscs in ap bursting cultures necessitated the blockade of ampa receptors. cnqx always blocked all burst activity  and was applied during the mk- <dig> washout period to ensure that synaptic nmda receptors remained blocked. under these conditions, mk- <dig>  application for  <dig> to  <dig> min encompassing  <dig> to  <dig> bursts was sufficient to reduce nmda receptor-mediated evoked epscs to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of their control amplitude . although such evoked epscs probably do not reflect the response of all nmda receptor containing synapses in each cell, they represent a random subset of such synapses, most of which were blocked by brief mk- <dig> treatment during bicuculline induced bursting.

having established the parameters necessary to selectively block synaptic nmda receptors, we utilized this protocol to functionally quantify the entire extrasynaptic nmda receptor pool in single neurons using simultaneous voltage clamp electrophysiology and fluorescent ca2+ imaging. synaptic nmda receptors were blocked by mk- <dig> during bicuculline induced ap bursting in current clamp mode . mk- <dig> was washed out of the bath in the absence of glycine as in the epsc protocol however cnqx was replaced with ttx to block all ap-induced neurotransmitter release in pre-synaptic cells. current and ca2+ responses to a  <dig> s rapid bath perfusion  of  <dig> μm nmda were then measured at a holding potential of - <dig> mv  in  <dig> μm glycine and in the absence of mg2+ . the extrasynaptic nmda receptor pool was measured in this manner in one cell per coverslip.

protective effects of ap bursting against nmda toxicity
as a first step towards analyzing a possible mechanistic link between extrasynaptic nmda receptor function and acquired neuroprotection, we established conditions that promote neuronal survival. hippocampal neurons were treated overnight with bicuculline, which induced recurrent bursts of aps that are associated with synaptic nmda receptor-dependent ca2+-transients throughout the neuron  <cit> . neurons were subsequently challenged with nmda  for  <dig> min, which triggers excitotoxic cell death. in untreated cultures,  <dig> ± 2% of cells showed condensed nuclei indicative of cell death; nmda treatment increased this cell death to  <dig> ± 2%. in cultures that were pre-treated with ap bursting for  <dig> h before nmda application, only  <dig> ± 1% of the neurons showed condensed nuclei and were counted as dead. ap bursting for  <dig> h without subsequent nmda treatment had no significant effect on cell death  . these results demonstrate that recurrent network ap bursting protects neurons from subsequent nmda-induced cell death.

ca2+ responses to toxic nmda treatment
since ca2+ overload has been suggested as a trigger for cell death in ischemia and nmda receptor activation  <cit> , we measured the ca2+ load at the soma activated by this toxic  <dig> min treatment with  <dig> μm nmda at 37°c  and compared it with hippocampal neurons that had been treated overnight  with bicuculline  <dig> μm  or  <dig> % dmso  at 37°c. ca2+ levels at the nmda response peak and at a time point  <dig> min after nmda washout were slightly higher in spontaneously bursting and bicuculline-treated cultures when compared to the control group . this indicates that prolonged synaptic activity resulting from ap bursting slightly increases the nmda-induced ca2+ entry and/or ca2+ release from intracellular stores, which could be due to preloading of the endoplasmic reticulum and/or a reduced sequestration and removal of ca2+ from the cytoplasm. thus the mechanism of protection afforded by ap bursting does not involve a reduction in the ca2+ load during this toxic nmda insult or the initial recovery period thereafter.

isolated extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated currents and ca2+ signals are not affected by overnight ap bursting
extrasynaptic nmda receptors are coupled to a creb shut-off mechanism and cell death pathways  <cit> . we reasoned that a specific reduction in extrasynaptic nmda receptor numbers or function could underlie the ap bursting-induced protective effects. nmda receptors are known to be endocytosed from extrasynaptic sites adjacent to post synaptic densities in mature dendritic spines  <cit> . in our cultures at the time point of recordings  spines are present . to investigate whether such changes occur after prolonged ap bursting, extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated whole cell currents and ca2+ responses were measured at room temperature in single cells  from overnight vehicle and ap bursting-treated neurons. all handling and medium change was performed in parallel to equalize non-specific effects. activity of patched cells was assessed in cell-attached mode and in current clamp mode immediately after break-in . all neurons in the bicuculline-induced ap bursting group showed regular bursts of aps in cell-attached and/or current clamp mode as well as bursting synaptic input  in voltage clamp mode.  <dig> to 20% of cells in the vehicle-treated group showed evidence of weak but regular bursting and were discarded from the analysis.

a number of parameters were quantified from the current and ca2+ responses to extrasynaptic nmda receptor stimulation . no significant difference was seen between the ap bursting and vehicle treatment groups in any parameter including amplitude, area and half widths of either current or ca2+ response .

charge transfer and area under the curve  were calculated from the integral of the trace between the current response onset and return to baseline and between the ca2+ response onset and a point  <dig> min later. current data comes from  <dig> vehicle and  <dig> ap bursting neurons of which ca2+ data was recorded in  <dig> vehicle and  <dig> ap bursting cells. all ca2+ analysis was performed from a somatic region of interest.

comparison of ap bursting during mk- <dig> exposure in epsc and bath nmda experiments
mk- <dig> is an open channel blocker requiring synchronous presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic depolarization to block nmda receptors in a progressive manner over multiple synaptic activations. although we cannot precisely quantify the number of synaptic activations in the presence of mk- <dig> in our recordings, we can estimate this from the number of bursts and aps occurring postsynaptically. patch clamp and microelectrode array recordings have shown that bicuculline-induced bursts involve significant prolonged depolarization and is tightly synchronized across broad regions of the hippocampal culture  <cit>  implying that the activity of a presynaptic and postsynaptic pair of cells is correlated and synchronized as is necessary for nmda receptor activation. indeed, our recordings of evoked epscs presented here show that synaptic nmda receptors are rapidly blocked by our mk- <dig> protocol. in our recordings of bath nmda responses we assumed that synaptic epscs were blocked to a similar extent to that shown in our epsc experiments because bursting activity during mk- <dig> exposure was roughly equivalent to that for epsc experiments as quantified in terms of several parameters .

average membrane potential  during bursts was calculated from the burst onset till the return to the baseline resting membrane potential . depolarization was calculated from the integral of the membrane potential above rmp over this same period summed across all bursts for each cell.

large scale analysis of extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated ca2+ responses
having seen no difference in extrasynaptic nmda receptor function between vehicle and ap bursting pretreatment groups under patch clamp analysis from single cells, we wished to reinvestigate this result using larger numbers of cells. for this we used a purely imaging based assay of ca2+ responses to extrasynaptic nmda receptor activation in multiple cells  in a single imaging field using a 20× objective. cells were not voltage clamped. to counteract the effects of strong depolarization-induced activation of voltage-operated ca2+ channels  and ap-induced neurotransmitter release during nmda exposure, we included the l-type vocc blocker, nifedipine , and the na+ channel blocker, tetrodotoxin  in our solutions. as with previous experiments, mk- <dig>  was applied to cells once synchronized bursting was induced with bicuculline, as seen by the regular synchronized ca2+ oscillations in all cells . between  <dig> and  <dig> bursts were allowed to occur in the presence of mk- <dig> to ensure synaptic blockade. mk- <dig> was then washed out in the presence of ttx and the absence of glycine before mg2+-free solutions were applied followed by nmda  for  <dig> min. due to the absence of mg2+, this protocol induced much stronger ca2+ responses than  <dig> min of  <dig> μm nmda application  despite the blockade of voccs and aps. the responses were marginally smaller in bicuculline-treated and spontaneously bursting hippocampal neurons in comparison to the control group . this result using hundreds of cells exposed a slight difference in extrasynaptic nmda receptor function between treatment groups which was too small to detect with our voltage clamp analysis.

discussion
validation of the bicuculline + mk- <dig> protocol to isolate extrasynaptic nmda receptor function
in the presence of mk- <dig>  nmda receptors show a stepwise blockade in response to repeated synaptic activation. more than 90% blockade of synaptic receptors has been demonstrated in autaptic cultures after as few as  <dig> stimulations in  <dig> μm mk- <dig>  <cit>  or  <dig> stimuli in  <dig> μm mk- <dig>  <cit>  and similar blockade is seen in cortical brain slices after  <dig> stimulations in  <dig> μm mk- <dig>  <cit> . the rate of blockade will depend on the probability of transmitter release, the postsynaptic membrane potential, the concentrations of mk- <dig> and glycine and the rate of insertion of any new nmda receptors into the synapses.

our recordings of evoked synaptic nmda epscs showed an 80% blockade after  <dig> min of mk- <dig> exposure during which  <dig> to  <dig> network bursts occurred. a similar degree of blockade after  <dig> min of the mk- <dig> protocol has been previously reported  <cit> . while further bursting may have produced a more complete blockade of synaptic nmda receptors, it is necessary to limit the period of mk- <dig> application due to the presumed ongoing exchange of synaptic and extrasynaptic nmda receptors through lateral movement  <cit> . such exchange is likely to add blocked receptors to the extrasynaptic receptor population and may prevent complete blockade of synaptic responses due to the continuous immigration of unblocked nmda receptors into the synapse. the use of 4-aminopyridine to enhance bursting  <cit>  could potentially avoid this problem by accelerating synaptic blockade. higher concentrations of mk- <dig> are not recommended as they sometimes block burst activity in our cultures just as nmda receptor antagonists can shut off rhythmic bursting in slices  <cit>  and reduce synaptically-activated spikes in the hippocampus in vivo . alternatively, it remains possible that the residual 20% of epscs not blocked by the mk- <dig> and bicuculline protocol represent nmda receptor-containing synapses which were not activated by bicuculline-induced ap bursting. a similar percentage of neurons in bicuculline-treated cultures did not show bursting in cell-attached and whole cell current clamp modes. note that residual unblocked synaptic receptors will contribute to our estimates of the extrasynaptic pool of nmda receptors. considering that the synaptic pool represents about 50% of the total nmda receptor pool based on estimates from similar hippocampal cultures  <cit> , this implies that 17% of our estimate of extrasynaptic function may be generated by synaptic receptors. our protocol effectively isolates the extrasynaptic nmda receptor function in standard hippocampal neuronal cultures and is a robust method to selectively activate or quantify this receptor population. this can serve as a valuable tool to study extrasynaptic nmda receptor function in vitro as we have done here to explore the involvement of trafficking in the protective effects of synaptic activity.

overnight recurrent ap bursting only marginally alters extrasynaptic nmda receptor function
the only significant difference found in extrasynaptic nmda receptor function between vehicle and overnight bursting treatment groups was a slightly smaller ca2+ response in the latter. the 6% difference between these groups was highly significant but seems unlikely to account for the dramatic reduction in cell death afforded by pretreating cells with overnight bursting. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that a critical threshold for toxicity exists and that this 6% difference in extrasynaptic receptor function straddles this threshold to produce a dramatic difference in cell death between control and ap bursting groups. however, it seems more likely that mechanisms other than reduced extrasynaptic nmda receptor function – such as ca2+ regulation of survival-promoting genes  <cit>  – are primarily responsible for the protective effects of synaptic nmda receptor stimulation with overnight ap bursting treatment. our observation that extrasynaptic nmda receptor numbers are only marginally affected by prolonged increases in synaptic activity parallel reports showing that extrasynaptic nmda receptors in contrast to synaptic receptors are unaffected by prolonged depression of synaptic activity with ethanol  <cit> .

other potential mechanisms for activity-induced neuroprotection include an enhanced ability of pre-treated neurons to cope with a normally toxic ca2+ load during nmda treatment. regular transient ca2+ influx associated with ap bursting for an extended period might be expected to foster improved ca2+ buffering, sequestration, or extrusion mechanisms in neurons. to the contrary, however, the normally toxic  <dig> min nmda application produced a slightly higher average ca2+ response in hippocampal neurons treated with overnight ap bursting . thus prolonged ap bursting does not seem to promote neuroprotection by improving the dissipation of a toxic ca2+ load.

it is possible that the relative contribution of synaptic and extrasynaptic nmda receptors to the ca2+ load activated by an nmda insult determines its toxicity and that the relative contribution of these two receptor populations is altered by activity. the ca2+ response to bath applied nmda arises from a mixed source including both synaptic and extrasynaptic nmda receptor populations and voccs, which differentially couple to creb function and mitochondrial membrane potential breakdown  <cit> . the larger ca2+ transients in cells pretreated with ap bursting  may result from an enhanced survival-promoting synaptic nmda receptor component, which more than compensates for the observed slightly reduced extrasynaptic nmda receptor function in this group. nmda receptor exocytosis and synaptic function can be up-regulated by synaptic activity leading to long-term potentiation  <cit> . ap bursting in hippocampal cultures also potentiates synaptic transmission  <cit> . any enhancement of synaptic nmda receptor number or function should promote the protective effect of this receptor population.

it remains possible that overnight bursting accelerates the development of spines and synapses containing nmda receptors thus increasing the synaptic nmda receptor pool in a given neuron. ca2+ signaling from synaptic nmda receptors is known to enhance dendritic outgrowth  <cit>  and synaptic delivery of nmda receptors occurs within hours of synaptic activation  <cit> . this scenario predicts an increase in the total  nmda receptor pool consistent with the slightly higher ca2+ response to bath applied nmda in cultures exposed to overnight ap bursting . the sprouting and/or growth of new nmda receptor-containing synapses would also strengthen the relative contribution of synaptic receptors to the response to bath applied nmda. this would help counteract the extrasynaptic nmda receptor-mediated toxic effects and facilitate neuroprotection in cultures treated with overnight ap bursting. regardless of any  alteration in surface expression or distribution of nmda receptors, the opposition of synaptic activity to nmda receptor-mediated death converges at a level downstream of the receptor, through opposing effects on creb function and target gene activation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed and validated a technique for the isolation and quantitative functional assessment of the extrasynaptic nmda receptor pool in cultured hippocampal neurons participating in neuronal networks. with this method we have shown that prolonged periods of ap bursting, which protects neurons from subsequent toxic insults, causes little change in the function of the extrasynaptic nmda receptor pool, a receptor population linked to neuron death.
