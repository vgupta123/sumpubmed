BACKGROUND
myostatin , a member of the tgf-β superfamily, has emerged as a key factor of muscle development and maintenance of muscle mass homeostasis  <cit> . this has strengthened the idea that mstn is a potential target for novel therapeutic strategies to improve the disease symptoms with potential long-term benefits in a variety of muscular dystrophies  <cit> , or for improving the management of muscular growth in livestock animals  <cit> .

inactivating mutations of the mstn gene are responsible for the development of a hypermuscular phenotype in cattle  <cit> , dogs  <cit> , mice  <cit>  and humans  <cit> . the hypermuscular phenotype associated with constitutive mstn loss-of-function results from both hyperplasia  and hypertrophy . an hypermuscular phenotype of the same magnitude as that observed for constitutive knockout has also been observed in mice with a conditional mstn knockout  generated by a cre-lox system  <cit> . this demonstrated that mstn modulates the muscle mass throughout development. the ability of mstn to control myoblast cell proliferation and differentiation has been demonstrated. examination of the molecular action of mstn has revealed an inhibitory influence on proliferation through the control of cell cycle progression  <cit> . mstn also inhibits myoblast differentiation  <cit>  partially through a decreased expression of myogenic regulatory factors . myogenin and p21cki have been identified as the major physiological targets of endogenous mstn in murine cells  <cit> . mstn has also been shown to negatively regulate satellite cell activation and self-renewal  <cit>  and this action may involve a regulation of pax <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, we recently demonstrated that mstn can regulate satellite cell proliferation via regulation of wnt <dig>  <cit> .

recent data established that mstn induces muscle atrophy. in mice, muscle disuse-induced atrophy generated by hindlimb unloading is associated with a reversible increase in mstn mrna abundance  <cit> . mstn has been implicated in muscle wasting in various diseases  and ageing  <cit> . transgenic mice that overexpress mstn selectively in skeletal muscle have lower muscle mass  <cit> . in adult rats, ectopic mstn expression induces atrophy of skeletal muscle as shown by a significant decrease in muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area and protein content  <cit> . this is associated with decreased expression of genes structural proteins  and myogenic transcription factors. moreover, inhibition of mstn rescues the muscular atrophy of caveolin-3-deficient mice  <cit>  and protects against muscle atrophy due to glucocorticoid treatment  <cit> . if some of the mechanisms by which mstn contributes to atrophy have been clarified, e.g. foxo <dig> activation and subsequent activation of ubiquitin proteolytic system  <cit> , the relative contribution of mstn to the regulation of the balance between atrophic and hypertrophic processes in muscle remains to be further elucidated. some questions remain to be answered such as the possibility that mstn might inhibit muscle hypertrophy rather than induce atrophy  <cit> .

we have previously analysed the metabolic profile of double-muscled cattle  <cit>  and more recently the molecular profiles in muscle in the context of mstn loss-of-function  <cit>  and hypothesised that these should help in the understanding of molecular mechanisms by which mstn regulates muscle mass homeostasis. the main objective of the present study was to identify mstn targets involved in the regulation of muscle mass. for this, we examined the transcriptional and proteomic profiles in the quadriceps muscle of mstn-null mice and their control littermates. the originality of this work was to combine two genomic approaches, namely transcriptomics and proteomics, providing complementary data.

RESULTS
transcriptomic profiles in myostatin-null mice muscle
to search for novel candidate mstn targets, we used oligonucleotide microarrays  of  <dig>  genes expressed in muscle. we examined mrna expression in individual samples from  <dig> constitutive mstn-null and  <dig> control littermates. a reference sample allowing hybridization with detection of  <dig> to 68% reliable spots was used to compare the patterns of muscle gene expression between groups of mice. the hybridization results showed that, among  <dig>  genes represented on the chip, an average of  <dig>   gave valid expression values. significance analysis of microarray  was conducted to detect statistically significant expression changes. in total, sam analysis revealed the differential expression of  <dig> up- and  <dig> down- regulated genes .

bioinformatic analysis indicated that genes belonging to the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase  pathway, insulin/igf pathway protein kinase β signalling, carbohydrate metabolism, cell differentiation were up-regulated . conversely, genes belonging to the canonical wnt signalling pathway, calcium signalling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction were down-regulated . twenty-three of the differentially expressed genes encoded for transcription factors of which  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated .

expression of upstream components of the pi3k survival pathway  were surveyed. the steady-state level of akt mrna  and phosphorylated protein  were increased in the muscles of mstn-null mice. differential expression of the gsk-3β was confirmed by qpcr and western-blot  analyses. in addition, the ratio of serine- <dig> phosphorylated gsk-3β/gsk-3β ration was increased, which illustrates gsk-3β activation in mstn-null versus wild-type skeletal muscle .

proteomic profiles in myostatin-null mice muscle
we have used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, high-throughput image analysis and candidate picking, coupled with mass spectrophotometry to investigate the proteome profile of mstn-null mice vs control littermates. comparison of the protein profiles using sam  revealed the differential abundance of  <dig> protein spots  in mstn-null mice vs wild-type controls. mass spectrometry analyses allowed the identification of the candidate spots . differential expression was confirmed for some selected proteins by western-blot analysis .

bioinformatic analysis indicated that most of the differential proteins were related to muscle energy metabolism. enzymes of the citrate cycle  and the respiratory chain , and the heart-fatty acid binding protein  were down-regulated . conversely two fragments of glycogen phosphorylase, and enolase  <dig>  were up-regulated . abundance levels of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, which catalyzes the last step of creatine biosynthesis, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, which catalyzes the reversible cleavage of inosine and guanosine to their respective bases hypoxanthine and guanine, and the adenylate kinase  <dig>  which is an important enzyme in cellular adenine nucleotide homeostasis, were also increased. myosin-binding protein h, which is a protein involved in the contractile apparatus, was revealed to be up-regulated in mstn-null mice vs wild-type controls and this was confirmed by western-blot analysis . fast glycolytic myosin heavy chain isoforms  were also more abundant in mstn-null mice vs wild-type controls in western-blot experiments . α1-syntrophin was found to be up-regulated in mstn-null mice . all together, these data are representative of greater fast glycolytic metabolism in the muscle of mstn-null mice.

a differential abundance of survival/mortality factors and some chaperones  was also detected with the down regulation of hsp alpha crystallin-related b <dig>  hsp 9a , and the up-regulation of tcp <dig>  tctp, dj- <dig>  and 14-3-3e. the differential abundance levels were confirmed by western-blot analyses for mortalin, dj- <dig>  tctp and 14-3-3e . all together these data indicate that myostatin inactivation was associated with up-regulation of survival/anti-apoptotic factors, in favour to increased cell survival.

discussion
in this study, we have looked for novel myostatin targets and mechanisms involved in the control of muscle homeostasis. for this, we have used a functional genomics strategy, which combined both transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of mstn-null vs wild-type control skeletal muscle. we hypothesized that examination of molecular profiles in the muscles of young growing mice in the context of mstn loss-of-function would allow the identification of myostatin downstream targets. however any changes in gene and protein expression may also reflect consequences of loss of mstn function. anyway, this approach should give information on direct or indirect mstn targets by revealing altered physiological pathways. a similar percentage of genes  and proteins  were declared to be differentially expressed with both techniques as indicated by the ratio of the number of differential genes and proteins to the total number of genes spotted on chips and proteins detected in 2-de gels in the range of ph 4– <dig>  respectively. transcriptomics and proteomics provided complementary data and led us to analyse both gene expression by qpcr and protein abundance by western blotting for some candidate targets.

as expected, the expression of several genes and abundance of proteins involved in muscle energy metabolism were altered. specifically we found an up-regulation of those involved in glycolytic metabolism and a down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins. similar to previously published results  <cit> , this provided additional evidence of a glycolytic shift within skeletal muscle in absence of functional myostatin. additionally, expression level of α1-syntrophin, a predominant syntrophin isoform in skeletal and cardiac muscle, significantly increased in mstn-null mice. this result is in agreement with the work of vandebrouck and co-workers  <cit> , which indicates that α1-syntrophin might play a potential signalling role in the regulation of calcium influx in muscle cells and thereby regulate muscle activity.

increased potential for pi3k pathway
our study revealed that upstream components of the pi3k/akt/gsk-3β, a signalling network that promotes cell survival and proliferation, were targets of myostatin inactivation. the core of the pi3k signalling pathway begins with pi3k activation and subsequent generation of the second messenger lipid phosphatidyl  triphosphate, which recruits and activates pi-dependent kinase. the latter phosphorylates and activates protein kinase b/akt  <cit> . gsk-3β is a substrate for phosphorylated akt and is inactivated upon phosphorylation. we detected the differential expression of mrnas that encode for pik3r <dig>  pik3cg, plcg <dig>  and gsk-3β. increases in the abundance of phophorylated-akt and in the activation ratio of gsk-3β  were also detected . this finding is original since the pi3k pathway is mainly regulated through post-translational modification namely phosphorylation. thus, our results indicate that myostatin inactivation resulted in increased potential for pi3k/akt activation and decreased potential for gsk-3β activity both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.

interestingly, we also detected the differential abundance of factors regulating the pi3k pathway e.g. dj- <dig>  pten and pink <dig>  dj- <dig>  a cancer- and parkinson's disease-associated protein also called park <dig>  protects cells from toxic stresses and is implicated in mitochondria and oxidative stress-related survival pathways . it associates with chaperonnes including mortalin. dj- <dig> has also been reported to be a novel regulator of the pi3k-pten pathway  <cit> . the tumour-suppressor phosphatase with tensin homology  is the most important negative regulator of the cell-survival signalling initiated by pi3k . dj- <dig> interacts with pten-induced putative kinase  <dig> , which encodes a ser/thr kinase with a mitochondrial-targeting signal, and collaborate to protect cells against oxidative stress induced cell death  <cit> . interestingly, our data show up-regulation of dj- <dig> and pink <dig> and down-regulation of pten both at the transcriptional and protein levels and this could account for activation of the pi3k pathway in mstn-null mice.

the pi3k/akt pathway plays a pivotal role in the promotion of cell proliferation and inhibition of cell death. it plays an important role in at least two signal transductory systems, namely, the wnt/wingless and pi3k pathways, which influence proliferation and cell survival, respectively. our data agree well with data that demonstrate a correlation between activation of pi3k pathway and increase in cell size  <cit>  and the activation of akt, which stimulates muscle hypertrophy and antagonizes the loss of muscle protein  <cit> . akt signalling through gsk-3β, mtor  and foxo <dig> was shown to be associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy processes in humans  <cit> . recently, amirouche and workers have shown that mstn negatively regulates akt/mtor signalling pathway  <cit> . it was also shown that mstn activates gsk-3β and decreases cyclin d <dig> by inhibiting the pi3k/akt pathway and this has been proposed to be involved in the progression of muscle-disuse atrophy  <cit> . lastly, the pi3k/akt pathway is the major intracellular pathway activated by igf-i stimulation during myogenesis  <cit> . a primary effect of gsk-3β inhibition in muscle is to promote myogenic differentiation and it has been proposed that igf-mediated hypertrophy involves the negative regulation of gsk-3β activity  <cit> .

altered expression/abundance of factors involved in cell survival/apoptosis
our data revealed changes in the expression of genes and proteins related to cell survival/apoptosis pathways. actually, we detected the down-regulation of some factors  and up-regulation of others  that may be a signature of increased cell survival and anti-apoptotic processes. indeed, alpha crystallin-related b <dig>  a heat shock protein  <dig>  is thought to protect cells from apoptosis  <cit> . heat shock protein 9a , a member of the heat shock protein  <dig> family, plays a central role in mitochondrial import, energy generation and chaperoning of mis-folded proteins . this factor interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p <dig> and inactivates its transcriptional activation and apoptotic functions  <cit> . up-regulation of mortalin contributes significantly to tumorigenesis  <cit> . dad <dig>  has been reported to be a programmed cell death suppressor necessary for cell survival in a mammalian cell line  <cit>  and the loss of dad <dig> protein triggers apoptosis  <cit> . survivin  is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis  family that prevents apoptotic cell death in various cell types including hematopoietic, endothelial, embryonic and neuronal cells  <cit> . translationally controlled tumor protein  is involved in the calcium binding and microtubule stabilization  <cit>  and has been implicated in cell growth, cell cycle progression, malignant transformation and in protection of cells against various stress conditions and apoptosis  <cit> . 14-3-3e is a member of the 14-3- <dig> family of phosphoserine-binding adapter molecules that mediate a general survival-promoting function through interaction with target proteins, by enhancing pro-survival signalling while suppressing activity of pro-apoptotic proteins . they are involved in the regulation of apoptosis through multiple interactions with proteins of the core mitochondrial machinery, pro-apoptotic transcription factors and their upstream signalling pathways. one prominent mechanism for the suppression of apoptosis is through 14-3-3-mediated sequestration of pro-apoptotic proteins . furthermore, 14-3- <dig> proteins regulate the akt/mtor pathway via interaction with pras <dig>  a mtor binding partner  <cit> . in our study, 14-3-3e showed greater expression in the hypertrophied muscles of mstn-null mice. interestingly, some of the differential proteins detected in our study  were reported to belong to the 14-3- <dig> interacting "phosphoproteome"  <cit> .

interestingly, in a previous study conducted in the context of mstn loss of function in cattle  <cit> , we have already found an up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in apoptosis  and a down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes belonging to the bcl <dig> family. supporting the hypothesis of decreased apoptosis in the muscles of mstn-null mice, we found that the bioactive fragment of the initiator caspase  <dig> was decreased in these mice compared to their littermates . the functional significance of proteins related to cell survival/apoptosis to muscle hypertrophy remains to be further studied. however, the results of the present study suggest that mstn may behave as an arbiter of the survival decision in the muscles. in mstn-null mice, increased abundance of anti-apoptotic factors probably induces a by-pass of apoptosis and consequently increased cell survival, a process leading to hypertrophy . the involvement of mstn in apoptosis remains scarce and controversial. there are conflicting results regarding mstn and apoptosis. it is not clear whether this factor protects myoblasts from apoptosis  <cit>  or promotes the apoptotic process  <cit> . this discrepancy may be explained by the different experimental conditions in which mstn effect was examined in vitro . although skeletal muscle is considered to be rather resistant to apoptosis partly due to high concentration of endogenous inhibitors , there is evidence that apoptotic events occur in skeletal muscle under physiological  and pathological conditions  and may contribute to atrophy and loss of fibers  <cit> . "myonuclear apoptosis" is a predominant form of apoptosis by which a loss of myonuclei occurs without cell death during muscle atrophy  <cit> . this process may have major consequence since  the number of myonuclei is a critical determinant for protein synthesis capacity  apoptosis within muscle may alter the myonuclear to cytosolic ratio . thus, modulation of myonuclear number or myonuclear domain size or both is a mechanism by which mstn may contribute to muscle homeostasis. inhibition of apoptosis in the context of mstn loss-of-function could lead to increased myonucler survival and consequently to increased protein biosynthesis. thus, this could contribute to the hypertrophic pathway, especially in growing mice. work is progress to assay apoptotic process in muscles according to mstn activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data indicate that mstn inactivation could promote survival and resistance to apoptosis in muscle through the pi3k/akt/gsk-3β survival pathway and through a mechanism that involves regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. a combination of increased potential for pi3k activation and decreased myonuclear apoptosis could be crucial to muscle hypertrophy in mstn-null mice .
