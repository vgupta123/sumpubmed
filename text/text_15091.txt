BACKGROUND
the whitefly, bemisia tabaci, is one of the most prevalent insect pests of agriculture in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, and transmits many plant viruses that result in serious crop losses estimated to range from several hundred million to billions of dollars worldwide annually  <cit> . this whitefly cryptic species complex can colonize over  <dig> host plant species  <cit> , and is known to transmit over  <dig> different viruses  <cit> . bemisia tabaci is a complex of cryptic species, previously known as biotypes that differ from one another in host range, reproductive compatibility, insecticide resistance, endosymbiont composition, and virus transmissibility . there are at least  <dig> cryptic species of b. tabaci recognized to date  <cit> . among these, the middle east asia minor  <dig> , formerly known as the b biotype or b. argentifolii  <cit> , and the mediterranean whitefly , formerly known as the q biotype, have become the most prevalent and agriculturally important cryptic species worldwide. this is in part due to their rapid dissemination throughout the world and apparent ability to adapt and displace other species  <cit> . meam <dig> is arguably the most widely distributed of the b. tabaci cryptic species complex, and is known to transmit viruses from five distinct genera. most of these are in the well-studied genus, begomovirus, but meam <dig> can also transmit viruses from the genera crinivirus, carlavirus, torradovirus, and ipomovirus  <cit> . furthermore, the mode of transmission varies among the different viruses.

traditionally, plant virus transmission has been categorized as nonpersistent, persistent, and semipersistent. nonpersistent viruses can be acquired rapidly by insect vectors during probing of plants with their stylets, and usually remain transmissible for only a few minutes to at most, a few hours following virus acquisition  <cit> . in contrast, persistent viruses, once acquired by the vector, are usually retained in transmissible form for the life of the insect. these viruses, as exemplified by whitefly transmitted viruses in the genus begomovirus, are ingested by their insect vector, pass through the gut membrane and into the hemocoel, circulate through the hemocoel, and eventually accumulate in the salivary gland from which they are released during feeding, resulting in virus transmission . viruses classified as having a semipersistent mode of transmission associate with different locations within vector mouthparts dependent on the type of insect vector, and likely virus as well. semipersistent viruses do not circulate throughout the body of the insect vector, and can be transmitted for only a few days  <cit> .

new information is emerging on the location of crinivirus association with whitefly mouthparts  <cit> . lettuce infectious yellows virus  was shown to associate with the anterior foregut, or cibarium of whitefly vectors , and a virus-encoded protein complex containing the liyv minor coat protein is involved in this interaction . there have not been any studies to date examining how whitefly gene expression changes in response to acquisition of a crinivirus during feeding. the objective of the current study was to determine whether gene expression differs between whiteflies that fed on plants infected with a crinivirus compared with those that fed on uninfected host plants. this would aid in clarifying whether crinivirus transmission results from a fortuitous association with pre-existing factors in whitefly mouthparts that bind the virus long enough to allow transmission, or if there is a deeper relationship in which the vector responds to the presence of the virus and the physiological changes it induces in an infected host plant with changes in its own gene expression that facilitate virus retention and transmission. in order to address this question, we examined the global gene expression changes that occur in b. tabaci meam <dig> during feeding on tocv-infected tomato and uninfected tomato using high throughput rna-seq technology.

analysis of differentially expressed genes  associated with feeding on tocv-infected plants compared to uninfected plants revealed several gene classes and specific biochemical pathways, including but not limited to orphan genes, glucose-transporters, α-glucosidases, and genes associated with the uric acid pathway, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, transport and catabolism, and receptors. we also identified immune related genes associated with insect defense, and genes known to be involved in interactions with animal viruses. this transcriptome study establishes a fundamental understanding of the changes in whitefly gene expression in response to feeding on plants infected with criniviruses, and provides a baseline for comparison of differential gene expression in whitefly vectors feeding on plants infected by semipersistent viruses.

RESULTS
transcriptome overview
to understand global gene expression changes in the whitefly in response to tocv, we performed rna-seq analysis on whiteflies that had been fed on tocv-infected  or uninfected tomato plants  for three different feeding periods;  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h. the rna-seq libraries generated  <dig> – <dig>  m raw reads per library, were processed to remove adapters, low quality reads, and reads from rrna, mtdna, and endosymbionts , which resulted in  <dig> – <dig>  m cleaned reads per library, with 75–86% mapped to the whitefly  reference genome  <cit>  . pearson’s correlation coefficients analysis showed data across different replications were highly reproducible .

degs in whiteflies associated with feeding on tocv-infected tomato
of the  <dig>  genes predicted in the whitefly genome,  <dig>  were found to be degs in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies, including  <dig> genes ,  <dig> genes , and  <dig> genes  expressed differentially at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, respectively . although the majority of degs in tocv whiteflies at different time points were distinct, there were some common among the three feeding periods . a principle component analysis  plot was generated for the  <dig> samples  that demonstrated clear separation between whiteflies that fed on healthy plants and tocv-infected plants for both 24 h and 72 h treatments. the more limited differences with the 48 h samples reflected the very limited number of degs observed between treatments at this sampling time point, but results of the 48 h treatment were also highly correlated among treatments and replications . further analysis of the degs at all time points in the whitefly associated with feeding on tocv-infected tomato plants revealed a large number of orphan genes, glucose transporters, α-glucosidases, genes associated with the uric acid pathway, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, transport, catabolism, and receptors.fig.  <dig> differentially expressed genes  in whitefly, bemisia tabaci meam <dig> following feeding on tocv-infected  or uninfected  tomato plants for  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h; a number of degs detected between tocv whiteflies and virus-free whiteflies at three different feeding time points; b venn-diagram showing unique and common degs in whitefly after feeding on tocv-infected or uninfected tomato plants at three different feeding time points; c principle component analysis  plot generated from  <dig> samples derived from virus free  or tocv-whiteflies with three aaps of  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h




orphan genes
of the  <dig>  degs between tocv whiteflies and vf whiteflies,  <dig> showed no homology to any known genes or proteins in databases such as blast and interpro, hence they are referred to as unknown or orphan genes specific to the whitefly. large numbers of orphan genes were differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies at 24 h  compared with those from vf whiteflies, but only three orphan genes were found to have differential regulation at 48 h . following the 72 h feeding period  <dig> orphan genes exhibited differential regulation , although  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were also differentially regulated at 24 h. comparisons identified  <dig> orphan genes exhibiting differential regulation in tocv whiteflies across all three feeding time points, although none exhibited significantly altered regulation at 48 h . eight out of  <dig> down-regulated orphan genes from tocv whiteflies were present as a tandem cluster of repeats with significant similarity to one another on scaffold  <dig> in the whitefly genome  <cit> . these orphan genes are relatively short , without introns, but with intact open reading frames, suggesting they are likely to be translated into proteins. interestingly, blast analysis of these eight orphan genes present on scaffold  <dig> identified six genomic hits from non-transcribed regions corresponding to either the full-length or the 5′ or 3′ ends of orphan gene bta <dig>  remarkably, another set of  <dig> orphan genes present on scaffold  <dig> were also found to have differential expression in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected plants compared to those fed on uninfected plants . six genomic hits with near identity to the full length or 3′ end of gene bta <dig>  an orphan gene from scaffold  <dig>  were also found in the non-transcribed regions. of these six non-transcribed genomic hits of bta <dig> regions, four were present as inverted repeats on scaffold  <dig> in a region adjacent to bta <dig>  and two were present on scaffold  <dig>  . we also examined the genomic hits of bta <dig>  an orphan gene that was up-regulated in tocv whiteflies at 24 h and had the highest fpkm  values in tocv whiteflies  compared with vf whiteflies  and fc  =  <dig>  with p-value =  <dig> e- <dig>  blast analysis of bta <dig> showed one significant genomic hit on a non-transcribed region with 99% identity at the nucleotide level, and this dna sequence is present ~7 kb upstream of bta <dig> on the same scaffold  <dig>  the second genomic hit for bta <dig> was found on the coding sequence regions of another orphan gene, bta <dig> , and contains seven introns. a significant number of orphan genes are present in diverse organisms, including fungi-sacharomyces, fruit fly-drosophila, plant-arabidopsis and human-homo. these genes are implicated in human disease, species-specific adaptive processes, host-parasite interactions, and interactions with the environment , suggesting the possibility of an important role or even interactions involving differentially regulated orphan genes in whitefly associated with feeding on tocv-infected host plants.table  <dig> twenty-one common orphan genes significantly down-regulated in tocv whiteflies following  <dig> and 72 h aaps compared to virus-free whiteflies




glucose transporters and α-glucosidases
ten and  <dig> unique glucose transporter and α-glucosidase genes, respectively were differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies compared with vf whiteflies . among  <dig> unique α-glucosidases, only the expression of bta <dig> was found to be significantly down-regulated in all three feeding periods. this suggests an important role for glucose transporters and α-glucosidases in the whitefly’s response to feeding on tocv-infected plants.table  <dig> genes encoding glucose transporters , α-glucosidases , and that are associated with the uric acid pathway  showing significant expression differences between whiteflies fed on tocv-infected and uninfected tomato leaves for  <dig>   <dig>  or 72 h

most abundant degs with high fpkm and fc values
to identify the differentially regulated genes with the greatest fc differences and the highest fpkm values between whiteflies fed on tocv-infected plants and uninfected plants for each feeding period, more stringent criteria were used to filter genes. using these stringent criteria , we identified significantly increased expression levels for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato during the feeding periods of 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively, compared with whiteflies fed on uninfected tomato plants . the genes exhibiting the greatest up-regulation in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected plants after  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h were bta <dig> , bta <dig> , respectively . both ohcu decarboxylase and uricase play crucial roles in conversion of uric acid to allantoin in the uric acid pathway  <cit> . the ten most differentially up-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h  all encoded unknown proteins  except for bta <dig>  the fourth-most up-regulated gene in this treatment, which encodes a flywch and mule domain containing protein . flywch is a type of zinc finger transcription factor that belongs to the c2h <dig> class  <cit>  and mule is mutator-like element that functions as a transposase  <cit> . among the  <dig> genes significantly up-regulated in whiteflies at 72 h, were again two genes related to the uric acid pathway: bta <dig> and bta <dig>  which encode uricase and ohcu-decarboxylase, respectively. both genes showed over-expression in tocv whiteflies with fc of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively and significant p-values . further analysis of up-regulated genes in whiteflies after a 72 h aap on tocv-infected tomato revealed that bta <dig>  phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase is also related to the uric acid pathway. this gene is involved in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides. purines are precursors for components of the uric acid pathway  <cit> . of the three up-regulated genes from the uric acid pathway in tocv whiteflies at 72 h, one gene, ohcu-decarboxylase was also up-regulated at 48 h with a fc =  <dig> , p-value =  <dig>  .table  <dig> up-regulated genes in whitefly  in response to feeding on tocv-infected vs. uninfected tomato for  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h

there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> down-regulated genes at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies. as was found with up-regulated genes, the greatest expression differences between whiteflies that fed on tocv-infected plants and those that fed on uninfected plants occurred after aaps of  <dig> and 72 h, whereas only a minimal number of significant differences were identified when whiteflies were given an aap of 48 h.

to further understand the roles of these down-regulated genes in tocv-infected whiteflies, we examined the roles of their homologs in other insect species. for perspective,  <dig> of the  <dig> most down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h are listed in table  <dig>  bta <dig>  was the most down-regulated gene in tocv whiteflies at 24 h. vitellogenins play roles in high fecundity, longer lifespan, housekeeping, as well as increased oxidative stress resistance in other insects  <cit> . the second most down-regulated gene was bta <dig>  which is known to be expressed in the antennae of insects, and is involved in sensing of environmental signals by triggering chemical-signal transduction  <cit> . among the  <dig> most down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h, four genes were classified as having housekeeping roles, including the vitellogenin-b , glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , heat shock protein  <dig> , and a transcription elongation factor b polypeptide, ubiquitin-related protein . the 48 h aap resulted in only three genes showing significant down-regulation compared to vf whiteflies: bta <dig> ; bta <dig> ; and bta <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes were identified as down-regulated from the whiteflies provided with 72 h aap on tocv-infected tomatoes compared to whiteflies fed on uninfected plants using stringent criteria. a large number of down-regulated orphan genes  were also identified. interestingly, seven of the  <dig> most down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies with 72 h aap were present as clusters on two scaffolds with significant similarity to one another at the nucleotide level  <cit> .table  <dig> down-regulated genes in whitefly  in response to feeding on tocv-infected vs. uninfected tomato for  <dig>   <dig>  and 72 h

kegg pathways analysis
kegg  pathway analysis was performed on degs revealed by the rna-seq experiments to identify potential pathways up-and down-regulated in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato at each of the three time points. only  <dig> %  of the total genes up-regulated in tocv whiteflies at 24 h were able to be annotated using kegg  <cit> . figure 2a provides a representation of the global functionality of the genes and summarizes the molecular pathways identified from up-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h. the five categories of pathways most represented as up-regulated in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato for 24 h were 1) metabolic pathways, 2) transport and catabolism, 3) cell growth and death categories, 4) endocrine system pathways, and 5) immune system pathways.  <dig> %  of the significantly differentially expressed down-regulated genes were annotated to kegg pathways at 24 h for tocv whiteflies, with the five most represented pathway categories identified as associated with: 1) signal transduction, 2) cancer, 3) the endocrine system, 4) protein folding, sorting, and degradation, and 5) metabolic pathways . kegg analysis was not performed for the 48 h aap because only  <dig> degs were present in tocv whiteflies at 48 h.fig.  <dig> summary of the kegg reference pathways associated with up-regulated  and down-regulated genes  from whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato  for 24 h. bars represent the percentage of the total kegg annotated transcripts  in the tocv whiteflies at 24 h compared to virus-free whiteflies




at 72 h, 48%  of the significantly up-regulated and 27%  of the down-regulated genes from tocv whiteflies were annotated using kegg. only the three most represented kegg pathway categories will be discussed for tocv whiteflies with the 72 h aap because only a few genes were assigned to the fourth and fifth categories. the three categories of pathways most represented were metabolic pathways, nucleotide metabolism, and signal transduction among up-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 72 h compared to vf whiteflies . in contrast, genes associated with transport and catabolism, metabolic pathways, and the endocrine system were the most prevalent categories of pathways identified from down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 72 h compared to vf whiteflies . detailed information about the genes, ko , annotations, score, and full pathways related to metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, cellular processes, organismal systems, and human diseases is available from tocv and vf whiteflies at  <dig> and 72 h in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> summary of the kegg reference pathways associated with up-regulated  and down-regulated genes  from whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato  for 72 h. bars represent the percentage of the total kegg annotated transcripts  in the tocv whiteflies at 72 h compared to virus-free whiteflies




further analysis of kegg data revealed eight differentially expressed receptor genes  found in tocv whiteflies after 24 h aap compared with only one cytokine-cytokine receptor up-regulated at 72 h . interestingly,  <dig> genes  from signal transduction pathways were differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies at 24 h compared with only eight  at 72 h . higher expression of genes with functions associated with endocytosis , phagosomes , lysosomes , and peroxisomes  were found in whiteflies given a 24 h aap. in contrast, down-regulation of a different set of genes  that belonged to only two categories  were found in tocv whiteflies after the 72 h aap . immune system related pathways were also highly represented in tocv whiteflies given a 24 h aap compared with vf whiteflies. a total of  <dig> immunity genes  from  <dig> distinct immunity pathways were differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies following the 24 h aap, whereas nine genes from a single immunity pathway showed reduced expression in tocv whiteflies after the 72 h compared with those in vf whiteflies. among the  <dig> immunity pathways, the most highly represented category from tocv whiteflies was that of antigen processing and presentation . all of the  <dig> up-regulated genes from “antigen processing and presentation” pathways were annotated as “cathepsin b”, while all down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h from the same immunity pathway were identified as 70 kda heat shock proteins except one, bta <dig>  . at 72 h, again a different set of six cathepsin b genes were down-regulated in tocv whiteflies, with the exception of two cathepsin b genes  that showed reverse expression pattern in tocv whiteflies at 72 h compared to 24 h.table  <dig> differential regulation of receptor genes associated with signaling molecules and interaction pathways in tocv whiteflies compared to virus-free  whiteflies after feeding periods of 24 h or 72 h

notably, genes associated with infectious viral diseases in other organisms were also highly represented under the “human diseases” category among down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h. nineteen genes that have been implicated in human viral diseases exhibited reduced expression in whiteflies upon feeding on tocv-infected tomato after the 24 h aap compared to those that fed on uninfected tomato. by contrast, only one  and two genes  implicated in human viral diseases were up-regulated in tocv whiteflies following 24 h and 72 h aaps, respectively.

rt-qpcr validation of select degs
an rt-qpcr experiment was performed on eight degs and three non-regulated genes for validation of the gene expression patterns identified using the rna-seq data. the eight degs selected for rt-qpcr validation were chosen either because their homologs had been previously implicated in viral interactions, or we were interested in the putative roles of these genes in the whitefly response to feeding on tocv-infected plants. the eight degs selected were: bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , bta <dig> , and two orphan genes: bta <dig> and bta <dig>  three non-regulated genes selected were: bta <dig> , bta <dig> , and bta <dig> . each of the  <dig> genes showed the same expression pattern  for both rt-qpcr and rna-seq analyses when compared from two different rna samples generated in two different years,  <dig> and  <dig> , validating the gene expression data in the rna-seq experiments.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr validation of selected genes differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies after feeding periods of  <dig>   <dig>  or 72 h compared to virus-free  whiteflies . each experiment contained three independent biological replications and three technical replications per biological replicate




discussion
temporal shift in gene expression
we examined for the first time, differences in global gene expression in b. tabaci meam <dig> whiteflies in response to feeding on plants infected with a semipersistently transmitted virus. gene expression differences were compared between whiteflies feeding on tomato plants  infected with the crinivirus, tocv, or on uninfected tomato following three different aaps . a far greater number of transcriptional changes occurred with aaps of 24 h  and 72 h  in tocv whiteflies than with the 48 h aap , compared with whiteflies fed on uninfected tomato plants . these results demonstrated an initial spike with  <dig> genes differentially expressed between b. tabaci meam <dig> whiteflies fed on tocv-infected and uninfected tomato at 24 h, indicating that the whiteflies were responding to the presence of tocv in tomato, changes in the content of tomato sap due to infection by tocv or a combination of both. interestingly, transmission of tocv by b. tabaci meam <dig> is most efficient during the first 24 h following virus acquisition , with rates declining over a 3 day period to 26% by 48 h and 5% by 72 h if whiteflies are removed from virus-infected source plants  <cit> . the limited number of significant differences in gene expression between healthy and tocv whiteflies after the 48 h aap suggests that initial changes in gene expression resulting from the influence of tocv in phloem had occurred prior to the  <dig> sampling, but subsequent changes that became more apparent later were only beginning. the latter was evidenced by the differential expression of ohcu-decarboxylase at both 48 h and at 72 h sampling time points. when whiteflies were given an aap of 72 h,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies, and the majority of these genes were distinct from those exhibiting differential expression at 24 h . the timing of the shift in gene expression at 72 h coincides with the time at which whiteflies  lose their ability to transmit virus  <cit> . although feeding continued through 72 h in these experiments, the shifts may reflect physiological changes that occur in the vector with passage of time following the initial shift in gene expression that was observed after initiation of feeding. these temporal changes in gene expression may contribute to the loss of virus from retention sites in the anterior foregut of the whitefly vector and loss of virus transmissibility.

orphan genes
a significant number of orphan genes  were present among degs from tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies. orphan genes do not show any detectable sequence similarities to genes in the genomes of other organisms  <cit> . they constitute a large portion of every sequenced genome, and are common among other arthropods. over 50% and 36% of the genes in the genome of the lone star tick, amblyomma americanum and water flea, daphnia pulex, respectively were identified as orphan genes. the genomes of drosophila melanogaster and aedes aegypti contain  <dig> % and  <dig> % orphan genes  <cit> . expression of orphan genes is often attributed to evolutionary adaptation of insects, host-parasite interactions, and interactions with the environment  <cit> . examples of the role of orphan genes in host-parasite interactions are found in the apicomplexan parasites, plasmodium and theileria, in which families of orphan genes encode surface antigens that are involved in interactions between the parasites and their hosts  <cit> . orphan genes from d. pulex that reside within tandemly duplicated gene clusters are significantly over-represented in transcriptomes generated from exposure to biotic and abiotic factors, as well as in different life stages of the insect  <cit> . additionally, their importance is reported in d. melanogaster fitness, and have been shown to be under selection in d. melanogaster and mammals  <cit> . we suspect specific roles for differentially expressed orphan genes in whiteflies associated with feeding on tocv-infected plants, because: 1) these genes comprise a significantly high proportion of the  <dig>  degs in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies and 2) altered regulation of orphan genes has been found with host-parasite interactions in other arthropods.

because these orphan genes do not show homology to known proteins from other species, we were interested in their possible origin. various models for the origin of orphan genes have been proposed: 1) gene duplication, 2) de novo gene evolution from ancestral non-coding dna, and 3) horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . in the gene duplication model, new copies of a gene can remain functionally active and identical to the original copy, become a pseudogene, or attain a completely new function through evolution  <cit> . orphan genes can also evolve de novo from non-coding regions of genomes by translocation of a dna segment into a transcriptionally active location controlled by regulatory elements. such orphan genes often encode short secreted proteins   <cit> . the identification of orphan gene homology in the non-transcribed regions of a sister taxon or in closely related species is necessary to determine if the orphan gene evolved de novo from non-coding regions  <cit> . the eight orphan genes present as a tandem cluster on scaffold  <dig> in the whitefly genome  <cit>  also showed high levels of homology with non-transcribed regions of the genome, and encode small peptides ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length . the presence and pattern of sequences on non-transcribed regions of the genome with homology to either the full-length bta <dig> sequence or to the 3′ end of this gene indicates a possible acquisition and integration of a gene from an unknown microorganism through hgt into the whitefly genome. this may have happened millions of years ago, followed by gene duplication and integration of the acquired gene into a transcribed genomic location that came under control of regulatory sequences. it seems that once bta <dig> or other homologs present on scaffold  <dig> had been positively selected in the whitefly, possibly through environmental or ecological pressure, further gene duplication occurred, resulting in six additional copies of bta <dig> in the whitefly genome. it is possible that all eight of the differentially down-regulated genes present on scaffold  <dig> in tocv whiteflies may have evolved through gene duplication. in support of this, no homologous or non-transcribed sequences were found in the pea aphid genome, which is a sister taxon to whitefly. one possible mechanism inducing down-regulation could be the triggering of the rnai silencing pathway in the whitefly, because the complex structure of these genes on scaffold  <dig> is composed of direct and inverted repeats, which may lead to the formation of dsrna, and generation of sirnas through the rnai pathway in tocv whiteflies; however, further studies are needed.

the putative origin mechanism of another orphan gene, bta <dig> was also investigated. bta <dig> is among the  <dig> orphan genes present as a tandem cluster on the scaffold  <dig> . six partial homologs of bta <dig> were identified in non-transcribed regions of the whitefly genome present on two different scaffolds . scaffold  <dig> contained three non-functional full-length copies  and a region corresponding to the 3′ end of bta <dig>  that was adjacent to a functional copy of bta <dig>  this implies bta <dig> may also have originated through gene duplication, thus supporting the model for orphan gene evolution proposed by domazet-loso t and tautz d  <cit> . in ants, 24–32% of all orphan genes are located in clusters, with cluster size varying from  <dig> to  <dig> genes, although these clusters contained unrelated genes  <cit> . the orphan gene, bta <dig>  was up-regulated in tocv whiteflies at 24 h aap with high fc and fpkm values. the blast analysis of bta <dig> revealed two genomic hits, first on a non-transcribed region  present ~ 7 kb upstream of bta <dig> and a second genomic hit showed strong homologies to the exons of another up-regulated orphan gene, bta <dig> in tocv whiteflies at 24 h. it is intriguing that this non-transcribed genomic hit is 99% identical at the nucleotide level to bta <dig> but it is not a functional copy. one of the possible origins of bta <dig> could be translocation of this non-functional dna segment into a transcriptionally active region of the genome  <cit> . comparative sequence analysis of the 1 kb promoter region of bta <dig> with a 1 kb region upstream of the non-functional copy of bta <dig> present on the non-transcribed region revealed significant disparities at nucleotide level. this suggests bta <dig> may have been duplicated and translocated to a region controlled by the regulatory elements of a strong promoter that drives the abundant expression of bta <dig>  interestingly, a second genomic hit for bta <dig> showed strong homology  to the coding sequence of another orphan gene, bta <dig> that has seven introns. it appears that bta <dig> evolved from a parent orphan gene, bta <dig> following intronification. this has also been reported previously for de novo originated orphan genes in the human pathogen, plasmodium vivax  <cit> . the significant regulation of orphan genes in b. tabaci in response to tocv infection of host plants hints at the possible evolution of adaptive mechanisms in the whitefly in response to the crinivirus, tocv.

glucose transporters and α-glucosidases
higher numbers of facilitated glucose transporter genes were regulated in tocv whiteflies with 24 h than with 72 h aaps . interestingly previous studies found that glucose transporter proteins are known to interact with viruses  and induction of the glut <dig> gene and protein in human immunodeficiency virus -infected cells was accompanied by an increase in glucose transport . infection by viruses has been argued to lead to increased metabolic demands upon the host cell and thus a need for increased movement of glucose. infection of human fibroblasts with human cytomegalovirus , a herpesvirus, also leads to increased glucose consumption, consequently increasing the level of glut <dig>  <cit> . hiv infection of h <dig> lymphocytic cells significantly increased glut <dig> gene expression, and this was accompanied by an increase in glucose transport within the infected cells  <cit> . although whiteflies do not become infected by tocv, differential expression of glucose transporter genes in response to virus infection of host plants provides solid evidence for the involvement of these genes in virus-vector interactions important for virus acquisition, retention, or transmission. at a minimum these results demonstrate that feeding on tocv-infected plants triggers increased expression of glucose transporters, which likely contribute to the virus-whitefly interactions associated with virus transmission.

besides glucose transporters, another major gene class that showed significantly altered regulation in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies was the α-glucosidase family. higher regulation of α-glucosidases occurred in tocv whiteflies with 24 h aap  than with the 48 h  and 72 h  aaps . interestingly, bta <dig>  was downregulated at all three time points in tocv whiteflies as demonstrated with rna-seq and rt-qpcr performed on rna generated from independent experiments . the biological functions of glycosyl hydrolases intervene in many critical steps of life, including catalytic activity, hydrolysis of polysaccharides, and pathogen defense, in addition to the turnover of cell surface carbohydrates  <cit> . inhibitors of α-glucosidases have been shown to act as antiviral agents against hiv and hepatitis b virus  by inducing misfolding of the virus-encoded glycoproteins present in the virus envelope  <cit> . the fact, that the expression of α-glucosidase genes was significantly altered in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato compared to those fed on uninfected tomato at all three time points, suggests that these genes may also influence factors involved in tocv interactions with b. tabaci, even though tocv virions do not have a glycoprotein envelope.

most abundant degs with high fpkm and fc values
when analyzed using more stringent criteria to filter genes with high expression and greater fpkm values that might play critical roles in tocv and whitefly interactions, all of the ten most up-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h were classified as unknown  genes, with the exception of the fourth gene, bta <dig>  the flywch and mule domain containing protein. the flywch zinc finger domain containing transcription factor was first characterized in drosophila and is a modifier of mdg <dig> proteins, which are putative chromatin modulators involved in higher order chromatin domains  <cit> . a flywch domain present in c. elegans peb- <dig> was shown to be involved in specific dna binding  <cit> . the up-regulation of gene bta <dig> exclusively in tocv whiteflies after the 24 h aap hints that high expression of bta <dig>  flywch and mule domain containing protein, may be required for a function associated with whitefly acquisition of tocv.

analysis of the  <dig> most up-regulated genes from tocv whiteflies at 72 h and the only two up-regulated genes from tocv whiteflies at 48 h revealed three genes associated with the uric acid pathway. the expression of two genes, bta <dig>  uricase and bta <dig>  ohcu-decarboxylase  from the uric acid pathway and one gene  that synthesizes purines and is a precursor for the uric acid pathway, were expressed at a higher rate in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies at 72 h . uric acid is a defense regulator and has been identified as a molecular scavenger of deleterious oxygen free radicals in drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . both genes, bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  play crucial roles in conversion of uric acid to allantoin  <cit> . the presence of two genes, bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  from the uric acid pathway, and a precursor of the uric acid pathway suggest this pathway may be up-regulated as part of a defense response in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected plants. this suggests that even though the virus does not infect the whitefly, the whitefly may be reacting to the virus itself and/or virus-induced changes in tomato sap by mounting a defense response.

the two top most down-regulated genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h were bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  . vitellogenin-b has been associated with high fecundity, longer lifespan, and a housekeeping role, as well as increased oxidative stress resistance in other insects  <cit> . however, the reduced expression of vitellogenin-b, bta <dig> in tocv whiteflies at 24 h contradicts the norm of high expression of vitellogenins in general. the chemosensory protein, bta <dig>  is known to be expressed in the antennae of insects, and is involved in sensing environmental signals by triggering chemical-signal transduction. chemosensory proteins also mediate the solubilization of odorant molecules and facilitate their transport to receptor neurons  <cit> . the other most differentially expressed genes in tocv whiteflies at 24 h appeared to have housekeeping roles , while at 72 h,  <dig> of  <dig> genes had unknown functions  and most were found to be repeats present in tandem clusters on scaffolds as previously discussed.

kegg pathway analysis
kegg pathway analysis of genes differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies compared with those in vf whiteflies following a 24 h aap revealed upregulation of metabolic pathways, cell growth and death, and the immune system among the top five most affected functional categories . a likely explanation for the over-representation of metabolic pathways could be that infection of tomato with tocv and its influence on gene expression changes in the plant triggered enhanced feeding desire in the whitefly, and enhanced expression of metabolic genes to support increased feeding activity. the activation of cell growth and death as well as immune system pathways signals a likely defense response of the whitefly to tocv. interestingly a higher number of receptor genes  were significantly differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies during the 24 h aap compared to only a single receptor gene up-regulated  with the 72 h aap . signal transduction and transport and catabolism pathways were the most represented in tocv whiteflies among down-regulated genes following the 24 h and 72 h aaps, respectively . notably, a higher number of genes from signal transduction pathways, were down-regulated than up-regulated in tocv whiteflies following the 24 h aap . those  <dig> signal transduction genes down-regulated in tocv whiteflies were associated with  <dig> kegg pathways, including the mapk signaling pathway , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase -akt signaling pathway , hippo signaling pathway , transforming growth factor-β  signaling pathway , and others . interestingly, mapk and tgf-β pathways were also down-regulated in whiteflies during whitefly-begomovirus interactions with tomato yellow leaf curl china virus   <cit> . the activity of pi3k-akt pathway is critical for functionality of some viruses. influenza a virus requires activation of pi3k-akt to penetrate host cells, and conversely vp <dig> protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus inhibits the akt pathway to promote cell death  <cit> . kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  is an oncogenic virus that promotes tumorigenesis through modulating the hippo pathway  <cit> . a large number of signal transduction and signaling molecules were down-regulated in tocv whiteflies during the 24 h aap, whereas few showed differential regulation at 72 h aap. this hints at possible sensation signals in whitefly as a response to attachment of tocv to its mouthparts.

the transport and catabolism category was the most represented category  identified among the down-regulated genes from tocv whiteflies after the 72 h aap . in contrast,  <dig> genes from the transport and catabolism category were up-regulated in tocv whiteflies during the 24 h aap. interestingly,  <dig> lysosome genes were up-regulated in tocv whiteflies with the 24 h aap, whereas a different set of nine lysosome genes were down-regulated in tocv whiteflies at the 72 h time point with the exception of two genes. studies by luan et al.  <cit>  revealed that genes associated with lysosome function were significantly up-regulated in tylccnv-whiteflies, but that study only examined a single time point  <cit> . because these rna-seq results demonstrated a greater number of lysosome genes activated in tocv whiteflies after the 24 h aap followed by down-regulation of a largely distinct set of lysosomal genes in tocv whiteflies after a 72 h aap, it can be speculated that up-regulation of lysosomal genes may be an indication of an antiviral response in whiteflies during virus acquisition, whereas down-regulation of a different set of lysosomal genes might be associated with events leading to virus detachment from the whitefly.

remarkably,  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> unique immune system related genes that were classified as belonging to “antigen processing and presentation” pathway were found to be differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies compared with vf whiteflies, indicating a strong immune response by whitefly to feeding on tocv infected tomato . when viruses infect healthy cells of vertebrates, antigen peptide is digested into fragments following presentation of fragmented protein on cell surface mhc molecules  for recognition and destruction by t cells  <cit> . due to the mounting immune response by healthy cells, viruses evade degradation by cytotoxic t lymphocytes through the mhc class i antigen processing and presentation pathway  <cit> . the expression of the kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus  related proteins k <dig> and k <dig> causes the rapid down-regulation of mhc class i molecules from the plasma membrane  <cit> . nef myristoylated protein from hiv-i performs multiple functions in the infection of host cells, including down-regulation of mhc class i  <cit> . the up- and down-regulation of genes from the antigen processing and presentation pathway in tocv whiteflies at 24 h and 72 h implied a strong immune response of the whitefly to tocv, and down-regulation of genes signifies the ability of tocv to suppress the whitefly’s immune response.

kegg analysis also identified a large number of genes  implicated in human viral diseases that were differentially regulated in tocv whiteflies compared to vf whiteflies following 24 h and 72 h aaps. for example, in tocv whiteflies at 24 h, bta <dig>  wnt protein was significantly up-regulated compared to vf whiteflies. wnt transcription factors inhibit viral replication in human t-cell leukemia virus type  <dig>   <cit> . a second gene bta <dig>  that showed up-regulation in tocv whiteflies after the 72 h aap was shown to interact with human t-cell leukemia virus type proteins  <cit> . a third gene, bta <dig>  is a type i serine/threonine kinase receptor that is also implicated in htlv-i and hepatitis-b infection. through the process of virion binding and entry, viruses are able to manipulate signal transduction pathways either through delivery of viral genes and proteins into infected host cells, or by activating cell surface receptors  <cit> . either could be a possible scenario in the case of whitefly interactions with tocv because criniviruses have been shown to bind to the mouthparts of the whitefly  <cit>  and rna-seq data demonstrated activation of genes associated with both signaling pathways and receptors. of the  <dig> down-regulated genes from tocv whiteflies at 24 h that were previously implicated in human viral diseases, six  were annotated as 70 kda heat shock proteins . heat shock cognate protein hsc <dig> is involved in rotavirus cell entry, in interacting with rotavirus through its peptide-binding domain, and reduces rotavirus infectivity  <cit> . the b. tabaci heat shock protein  <dig>  also responded to the acquisition and retention of two begomoviruses, tylcv and squash leaf curl virus  <cit> . interestingly, tocv encodes a hsp <dig> homolog in its own genome  <cit>  that is a part of the ‘rattlesnake tail’ structure at the 5′ end of crinivirus genomic rnas, the same region of the virion that appears to associate with the anterior foregut of vector whiteflies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
herein, is demonstrated differential regulation of genes in whiteflies fed on tocv-infected tomato plants compared with whiteflies fed on uninfected tomatoes. deg analysis demonstrated a temporal shift in gene expression between 24 h and 72 h aaps, but with very few differences between whitefly treatments at 48 h. differentially regulated genes included a large number of novel orphan genes, genes associated with glucose transporters, α-glucosidases, and genes from the uric acid pathway, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, transport and catabolism pathways, immune-related genes, and candidate receptors. the genes and pathways differentially regulated in whiteflies demonstrate for the first time how a whitefly vector responds physiologically when host plants are infected with a semipersistent virus. it is likely that several of the degs and differentially regulated pathways contribute to aspects of tocv acquisition, retention in the vector, and transmission to new host plants during subsequent feeding. this information facilitates further studies on specific interactions determining specificity of crinivirus vector transmission. more broadly, knowledge of vector-virus interactions at a fundamental level is critical to the development of novel genetic control strategies aimed at reducing vector transmission of viruses, and sustainable and effective measures to reduce the spread of whitefly-borne pathogens.
