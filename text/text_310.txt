BACKGROUND
the human microbiome project has taken a metagenomic approach to identifying the bacteria in a wide variety of sites on and in the human body because the substantial majority of these bacteria have not been grown in culture [e.g., <cit> . second generation dna sequencing on this level presents a formidable informatics challenge. it is unlikely that such sequencing will be useful for individual investigators and clinical diagnostics. therefore, the challenge is to detect each bacterium in a mixture when all that is known about the bacterium is a partial genome sequence.

in a previous publication  <cit> , we presented our adaption of molecular inversion probes [mip;  <cit>  to detect bacteria using a massively multiplex molecular technology. mip technology was developed, in large part, to discover and assay single nucleotide polymorphisms in human dna  <cit> . the human genome is diploid. bacterial genomes are haploid, and, therefore, the background for molecular probe technology is significantly lower. because of this important difference, we simplified the method by dispensing with the "inversion".

our method requires only a sequence of forty sequential bases unique to the bacterial genome of interest, such as derived from the sequences produced by the human microbiome project. all necessary reagents are commercially available, including an affymetrix genflex tag16k array v <dig> . whereas we reported previously the results of employing the molecular probes with simulated clinical samples , we report now the results with a set of clinical samples: swabs of the vaginal epithelium.

while the assay on tag <dig> arrays allows the multiplexing of the detection of the bacteria in each clinical sample, nevertheless, one tag <dig> array must be used for each sample. to multiplex the clinical samples, we introduce a second, independent assay for the molecular probes employing sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection . all reagents are also commercially available. by adding one unique oligonucleotide barcode for each clinical sample, we combine the molecular probes after processing each sample, but before sequencing, and solid sequence them all together. overall, we have employed  <dig> molecular probes representing  <dig> bacteria to detect the bacteria in twenty-one vaginal swabs as assessed by the tag <dig> assay and fourteen of those by the solid assay.

RESULTS
we have published the design of our molecular probes  and our assay procedure  <cit> . these are recapitulated in the methods section.

simulated clinical samples
our earlier work with simulated clinical samples proved critical for development of the molecular probe technology as assayed on tag <dig> arrays  <cit> . therefore, we employed the same simulated clinical samples and assayed them by solid sequencing. table  <dig> presents the results. when assayed by solid sequencing , there were no false negatives and one false positive. importantly, lactobacillus acidophilus was correctly found in sca. with further regard to lactobacillus for the five simulated clinical samples, the molecular probes for l. brevis were positive for only scc, the sole sample containing l. brevis. the l. gasseri probes were positive for the three simulated clinical samples containing l. gasseri  and falsely positive for one more . although not shown explicitly in table  <dig>  we counted a large number of bacteria correctly negative for each of the five simulated clinical samples: sca,  <dig> correct negatives; scb, 33; scc, 33; scd,  <dig>  sce,  <dig> 

genome/
the five simulated clinical samples are labeled a-e. columns 1: genomic dna concentration, ng/Î¼l. columns 2: tag <dig> results. columns 3: solid results. in columns  <dig> and  <dig>  "1", a majority of the molecular probes for that genome was positive. "0", a majority of the molecular probes for that genome was not positive

within the tag <dig> data, we found one false negative and no false positives. the false negative was for l. acidophilus in simulated clinical sample a . two of the four l. acidophilus molecular probes were positive for sca. since 50% is not a majority, we could not call l. acidophilus present. none of the four l. acidophilus molecular probes was positive for any of the other four simulated clinical samples, not even when two other members of the same genus, l. brevis and l. gasseri, were present: that is, there was no cross-reaction. for each of the five simulated clinical samples, we counted a large number of bacteria correctly negative: sca,  <dig> correct negatives; scb, 35; scc, 36; scd,  <dig>  sce,  <dig> 

taken as a whole, the results for the simulated clinical samples and the two assays  were in excellent qualitative agreement. however, quantitative agreement between the two methods was not as good. as an example, the solid assay for scb is shown in figure  <dig>   the molecular probe leading to the most sequence reads was for streptococcus agalactiae dna. this number was dramatically different from the number of sequence reads for the second s. agalactiae probe . the second highest number of sequence reads was for one molecular probe for bacteroides fragilis dna. however, b. fragilis dna was present in the least amount of the four genomic dnas .

clinical samples
our sole criterion for determining which clinical samples  would be pursued in molecular probe studies was the availability of the dna after bigdye-terminator  sequencing  <cit> . there was sufficient dna from twenty-one vaginal swabs to pursue the molecular probe method as assayed on tag <dig> arrays. of these, there were fourteen dnas sufficient to additionally pursue the molecular probe method as assayed by solid sequencing.

the complete results for all swabs are given in table s <dig> . we present three examples here . for clinical sample a08- <dig>  bigdye-terminator sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene  identified two bacteria for which there were molecular probes: l. crispatus and l. jensenii, in substantially different amounts . the same two bacteria were also identified by molecular probe technology as assayed on both tag <dig> arrays and by solid sequencing. based upon the bigdye-terminator data, neither assay produced false negatives or false positives with this clinical sample.  thirty-seven and thirty-eight bacteria were correctly negative with the tag <dig> and solid assays, respectively.

the bigdye-terminator data are from  <cit> . for the purposes of this table, those bacteria whose presence was supported by less than ten bigdye-terminator reads have been ignored. novel bacteria and bacteria without a public genome sequence have also been ignored because they cannot be detected by the molecular probes. "1", a majority of molecular probes for this genome was positive. "0", a majority of molecular probes for this genome was not positive

for clinical sample a10- <dig> , bigdye-terminator sequencing of rdna identified two bacteria for which there were molecular probes: l. crispatus and l. gasseri, in substantially different amounts. both assays detected l. crispatus, but neither assay detected l. gasseri. clearly, the l. gasseri molecular probes had not cross-reacted with l. crispatus dna. we assume that the amount of l. gasseri dna in clinical sample a10- <dig> was below the minimum detection limit of the molecular probes, although the minimum detection limit of the molecular probes in clinical samples has not been determined and was probably different for each probe  <cit> .  thirty-seven and thirty-eight bacteria were correctly negative with the tag <dig> and solid assays, respectively.

clinical sample a22- <dig> presents a more complicated picture . both assays correctly identified l. crispatus and l. jensenii dnas. however, the tag <dig> assay identified enterococcus faecalis dna, and the solid assay identified treponema pallidum dna as being present. nevertheless, thirty-six and thirty-seven bacteria were correctly negative with the tag <dig> and solid assays, respectively.

the qualitative agreements between the bigdye-terminator and tag <dig> data and the bigdye-terminator and solid data are shown in table  <dig>  for the twenty-one swabs for which there were tag <dig> data, thirteen  were in complete agreement with the bigdye-terminator data. for the fourteen swabs for which there were solid data,  <dig>  were in complete agreement with the bigdye-terminator data. five  swabs had apparently false positives by the tag <dig> assay and three  by the solid assay. there was no coordination of the apparently false positives between the two assays. as examples, a16- <dig> had five false positives by the tag <dig> assay while the solid assay produced none. a01- <dig> had four false positives by the solid assay while the tag <dig> assay produced none.

a, agreement; b, one  false positive; c, one  false negative; blank: insufficient amount of sample to undertake solid sequencing. in all cases, bacteria inferred to be present, but at a concentration below the minimum detection limit of the molecular probe technology, have been ignored. only those bacteria for which there were molecular probes were considered

the false negative category was impacted by the undeterminable minimum detection limits for each molecular probe. as an example, for a10- <dig>  the presence of corynebacterium glutamicum was supported by < 1% of the bigdye-terminator reads . not one of the three c. glutamicum molecular probes was positive in either the tag <dig> or the solid assay. leaving aside those seven negatives that are probably explained by the minimum detection limit , there remained five false negatives:  <dig>  from the tag <dig> assay and  <dig>  from the solid assay. there was no coordination between the two assays. as an example, l. gasseri was supported by > 2% of the bigdye-terminator reads for seven swabs. for five of these , all assays were positive for l. gasseri and were in agreement . a07- <dig> was falsely negative for l. gasseri by the tag <dig> assay, but correctly positive by the solid assay . in the former case, three of six  of the l. gasseri molecular probes were positive. for a03- <dig>  none of the six l. gasseri molecular probes was positive on the tag <dig> array . this last result remains an anomaly. the number of correctly negative bacteria was also important. for the sample with the most apparently false positive tag <dig> identifications, a16- <dig>  nevertheless, thirty-one bacteria were correctly negative . for the sample with the most apparently false positive solid identifications, a01- <dig>  nevertheless, thirty-two bacteria were correctly negative .

the large number of solid reads and the high fluorescent intensities on the tag <dig> arrays allowed the calculation of pearson's correlation coefficient between the two assays and between each assay and the number/percent of bigdye-terminator reads. pearson's correlation coefficient ranges from  <dig> to - <dig> and represents a quantitative comparison. the results are shown in table  <dig>  there were thirteen comparisons of the solid data to the tag <dig> data. eleven  of the coefficients were >  <dig> , and nine  of the coefficients were equal to, or greater than,  <dig> . there were twelve comparisons of the solid data to the bigdye-terminator data. seven had a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and one had a correlation coefficient of  <dig> , for a total of 66%. there were seventeen comparisons of the tag <dig> data to the bigdye-terminator data. eleven had a correlation coefficient of  <dig>  and three had a correlation coefficient of >  <dig>  for a total of 82%. thus, overall, the quantitative correlations were excellent.

discussion
every technology has its advantages and disadvantages. there are two important challenges in detecting bacteria by amplifying and bigdye-terminator  sequencing rdna.  rdna genes are present at multiple copies per genome, and the copy number differs among bacteria  <cit> .  the "universal" primers have mismatches to the rdnas of highly relevant bacteria  <cit> . the negative impact of mismatch between primer and template is substantial  <cit> . baker et al.  <cit>  found that no primer pair had good matches to all bacterial rdna. therefore, bacterial genomes with few ribosomal rna genes and/or with rdna sequence mismatch to the primers will likely be under-represented in the sequencing library. the same considerations make determining the minimum detection limit problematic. in earlier work, we accomplished extensive modeling of the cost/benefit ratio for bigdye-terminator sequencing  <cit> . we concluded that four 96-well plates of sequence reads maximized the cost/benefit ratio, which is what we accomplished for these vaginal swabs:  <dig> Ã  <dig> =  <dig> . bigdye-terminator sequencing has a very low error rate. nevertheless, our rule-of-thumb is to require  <dig> bigdye-terminator reads  to securely detect a bacterium.

our molecular probe technology requires a reasonably secure genome sequence for each bacterium and the synthesis of long oligonucleotides. second generation sequencing is providing bacterial genome sequences faster and cheaper than bigdye-terminator sequencing. the cost of synthesizing oligonucleotides is coming down, while the length is going up.

for the molecular probes, the homers are based upon single copy sequences. thus, unlike rdna-based detection, there is no copy number variation among bacterial genomes that could confound the results. however, to design the homers, we started with complete genome sequences of specific strains of any given bacterial species. the bacterial genome sequence section of genbank  contains only a fraction of the genome sequences of all of the strains for any given species. thus, a molecular probe may be correctly positive for one strain's genome and correctly negative for another's. this situation would give rise to false negatives in detecting bacteria. we have attempted to minimize this possibility by employing multiple probes per genome and with homers derived from different parts of the genome sequence.

we have employed two very different assays for the molecular probes: tag <dig> array and solid sequencing. there was an apparent lack of good, relative quantitation for both assays, as seen for the simulated clinical samples. with the tag <dig> assay, fluorescence intensity is an exponential function of mass and, thereby, inherently difficult to quantitate. however, the assay for each sample requires an individual tag <dig> array, and, therefore, each tag <dig> assay is independent of the other tag <dig> assays. the solid assay requires only counting the number of reads supporting the presence of each bacterium. however, as with any multiplex sequencing, the samples are not independent, as there is a limit to the total number of reads.

our goal is to produce a technology that will detect bacteria without culture, with commercially available reagents, highly multiplexed, and that will ultimately be fast and inexpensive. other investigators have invented or adapted technologies toward likely the same goal. several examples follow. the insignia system is closest to our technology  <cit> . the system is in two parts. the first part is the publically available software that defines oligonucleotides unique to the target genome of interest  <cit> . the second part is a quantitative pcr assay   <cit> . the software is definitely useful. the qpcr assay cannot be multiplexed. nikolaitchouk et al.  <cit>  applied "checkerboard dna-dna hybridization" to detect the microbes in the human female genital tract and achieved a 13-plex reaction. given the complexity of this technology, it is unlikely that very high multiplex can be achieved. desantis et al.  <cit>  designed and successfully employed a microarray containing  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes derived from the rdna of  <dig> subfamilies of prokaryotes. willenbrock et al.  <cit>  designed and tested a microarray that contained genome sequences from seven escherichia coli genomes. their microarray is not commercially available and is unlikely to accommodate very high multiplexing. dumonceaux et al.  <cit>  coupled microbe-specific oligonucleotides to fluorescently labeled microspheres and detected and counted the fluors by flow cytometry, achieving a 9-plex reaction. at present, it is not clear which, if any, of these technologies will turn out to be widely used for detecting bacteria.

while we have concentrated on the detection and identification of bacteria, our molecular probe technology is not limited to that function. archaea, viruses, even individual genes , could also be detected. the only requirement is sufficient genome sequence to design the unique sequence similarity region of the molecular probe. because of the multiplex nature of both assays for the molecular probe technology, thousands more probes, representing thousands more entities, may be added at any time  <cit> . eventually, the entire human microbiome, in health and in disease, may be assayed in a single reaction tube and employing only commercially available reagents.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented the first use of our molecular probe technology to detect bacteria in clinical samples. in addition to the tag <dig> array assay, we introduced a second assay employing solid sequencing. the solid sequencing assay allowed the processed samples to be combined before sequencing for even greater multiplexing. the correlations among those two assays and the previously published bigdye-terminator sequencing assay were excellent.
